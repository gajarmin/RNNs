[Intro]
LD, AKA The Independent Variable
Trap God, and we servin' up the whole world

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Ay, where the gold at, baby?
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?
Ay, where the dough at, baby?
And the banger but you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)
Ay, we gon' save that money
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on them
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L, The Jew Biz Major?
Fuck you know about the world he was raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away
Book flight December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get login's for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thotties, I disregard them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin', preacher
I can take his ass church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burb like a baby without no hiccup
I can...

[Interlude]
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know a full verse would have been to expensive anyways
I think

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie
Hair cut several months in-between, homie
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave, homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Air B&B the mother fucker, least I'm never there
I'm not in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it
401k rollin' over bands on it
Coppin' sweaters in the summer with the sail on it
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpay for it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count, hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shiz though
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin finch tho
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Kept the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Fetty Wap]
Everytime these niggas tryna play
And lately I've been stackin' up
Cause I'm bout the bands baby
100k underneath the bed baby

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing a long like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you
Than it need be, so think about it take a minute let it breathe B
But think about it bruh you saw me take the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp up in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kyke know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that [snicker]
You didn't... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassedAin’t no doubt about it shit is coming
And I’m just praying that Lil Dicky love it
Always told myself that this the type of shit I wanted
I was being honest, even made a promise
Not with anybody else, this was inner conscious
Talking to my fucking self, das a little bonkers
I know, I still got a lot of shit to conquer
I hope, that ain't even ma concern tho
You know I’ll be working till I get what I deserve
Whatever totems I get personally you know I’ma earn those
This ain't even bout some shit up on a checklist
This about the fact that I’m about to test this
I’m about to figure out what ma best is
I can't avoid it because now ya boy invested
And I ain't gotta a choice except to smile and accept it
Pretty reckless, pretty restless cuz
I’ve lived my life expecting love
To come the second my attempt was done
And yea I guess to some extent I was correct because I’m getting buzz
But now I’m bout to be ubiquitous, look it up
Yeah, or that’s at least what I’m assuming
But as alluded to reality is looming and
Now ya dude about to make a move and take the truth
And hope to god that when he through
That what he thought about is proven
But honestly im not afraid that it’s delusion
I’m hot enough to where I know it’s not illusion
But obviously I been finding this confusing
This ain’t even close to what I thought I would be doing
Don’t get me wrong, I was born to be big
But I always figured it would be the comedy thing
So I started rapping just to see what drama it brings
What big dogs from sitcoms would hollerat me
And as the time past, I rhymed faster, lines crafted
Was high class as I mastered my craft and
Goddamn, who’da thought it get like this
Back in 2010 music wouldn’t make that list
I’m talking top 5 to 10 strengths, with no winks
I would not lie, my pen dry, with no ink
Or…that’s at least what I thought
Till I clawed and scratched the pen till I saw a line draw
Then I coulda let bygones be bygones
But I really wanted to rhyme till ma line drawn
Like where the fuck is ma peak at
Not Brown but I make it pop, then I beat that
Not crowned yet, but I don’t think I decreed that
Not loud, but you know I’m ready to tweet that
I just really hope I’m ready to be that
Now you seeing where D’s at
Cuz even tho I’m softer than a tissue I ain't nothing to sneeze at
I’m smarter, where fuck ya degrees at
And I ain't harder but I’m hotter homie, where da fuck ya degrees at
I’m bout to come in and desaturate
The chic rap today
And evaporate
The feedback I hate
I’ll elaborate
At a later date
But I’m getting off the point with the player hate
What the fuck was I saying, oh yeah
I’m kind of a slave
To my ambition, I ain't quittin till ma shit is appraised
And I admit it, I predict that where I finish is crazy
But that just means that it’s further away
So…Burd about to work until he turn in his grave
It’s really burdensome when earning something’s fun for the day
But I’m concerned about da burning out from upping the stakes
I’m always uppin the steaks
I’m taking dinner meetings in New York, always up for the steaks
We exploring the discussion of great
They assuring me that when I’m more elite
I’ll be secure and amazed
But this isn’t insecurity mang…
Like this the opposite of that, confidence in fact
Ma biggest problem is I can't honestly relax
Because inside of me a damn odyssey enacts
And I made a promise that I can't be the body that’s stopping it
Think I need a lobotomy
Lil dicky the prophecy
Little bit of anomaly, not a commodity, not a façade, or a lotta
Da Comedy prodigies commonly brought up wit Dicky
Feelin weird, lemme think of an analogy
Just imagine for a second what if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality
Grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality
Was people that conform to the ruralest localities
To Russell though it was nuffin but normality
And he really nice up on the plow in actuality
Everybody liked the kid and dug his personality
And so da mutuality was somewhat rationality
So then ya man made a plan of practicality
Not even a plan, it was more of a formality
Get a little land and attend to its vitality
Then raise a little fam till it all became finality
The strategy was just to stay in the course
And do ya chores, when ya happy you ain't need to abort
Never explored nothing less he rollin round on his horse
Then one day he was up on his horse
That’s when he went past the porch
The path he normally passes forth
Was fast and short, was after more
Went faster north, amassed a lure
To master more…and then discovered the court
He like yaaa…let me down Tim
Hopped off, lookin puzzled at the round rim
Saw a ball up in the corner on the ground then
Russell started dribbling and giggling astounded
Then he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it
And when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin sound friction
Up in a swish make and he was confounded
Because he knew that he had found him
But right now, it was still for the fun
Just a way to kill the time when the farming was done
Then the walking turned to running, and the hoppin turned to jumping
And dunking, and Russell had to keep coming because the young’n was fucking
Disgusting and loving it, running it, all of a sudden the public started to come
In abundance and fuck wit him, cuz he was butter and hungry, hung jury
Cuz stories of glory not normally for people like him
Then the word got around up to ESPN
And they flying Russell down to compete in the gym
Bunch a grown men lookin to belittle the kid
Because to those men, ball was the reason to live
And the GOATS they been all in since they was kids
So this goat owning mafucka look like a dick
And even know Russell knows that, he doesn’t submit
He just chills wit a grin
And then the game start, and this muthafucka take charge
Make it rain, hard D up on these bitches making children of men
Lookin better than his predecessors ever could get
Turned the animosity to respect
And then the Thunder called him
Said they heard a lot about the ballin
Told him that they wanna get involved and
Showed him all the shit that you can get up in the league, it’s so appalling
Oklahoma City in the autumn, hella pretty
Awesome, errbody laud him
Erry bitty lookin like they really fucking fallin
Condominium is so legitimate it’s sprawling
And this muthafucka on the court straight ballin
Cash all up in that ass
Lol’ing at the past like, where the fuck would I be at up on the other path
Right?
If I never stumbled pon the game then think of that life

Shit, who taking care of ma farm?
Who taking care of ma farm?
Who taking care of ma farm?
I really loved that farm…uh

CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE
500 million now that’s a pound cake
According to Jay Z, and Drake…
But greatness ain’t about cakeEy what's going on man?
It's your boy Lil Dicky
A.K.A Mr. Leftward-Sloping Penis
I got a story for y'all man
Peep this
Yessir

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Now I been datin this girl named Katie, she hot as hell
And her body crazy, vagina shaven and it dont smell
And I don't fall for chickens
But this one a little different
Body sickening
Plus she really good at making breaded chicken
Got me thinkin she the one man
Even fully clothed, shawty really fun man
Get a lotta hoes, but none of those come close
I swear this the most that I've felt so damn exposedddd
Oh yeah there's one more thing
And I know this shit gonna sound insane
But I still haven't hit it
I admit it, I wish I was kidding
Never been up inside before
Because shes only fucked one guy before
And though I really wanna boink this whore
She ma sweetie 3.14
So I'm stayin patient, and masturbating
And now ma heart is sorta racing
Cuz she said tonight will be the night we do some fornicating
Hell yeah, I'm down, I'm bout to go all out
I'm gonna pound that crazy, like an elaborate black man handshake
But on the way to crib, we pass this kid
And he seem to know who Katie is
So I say "who this" and she say
Dicky, this is my ex boyfriend Jim"

[Hook 1: Lil Dicky]
And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm lookin at this dude I can't believe my eyes
Cuz he's the best looking guy that I've seen in my whole life
He's got the thickest head of hair, chiseled jaw, an egregious bod
Man this the closest thing I've seen to a Grecian god
And now I'm lookin at ma chick, cuz his dick's been inside her rawww

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Awww damn
Man this is crazy
I can't believe this guy used to fuck ma lady
I bet he left that pussy ravaged like Haiti
Katie's huggin and squeezing his shoulder blades
And I'm buggin and queasy, this ain't okay
And then they say, "let's get drinks" so I say okay
Even though I was about to get laid!
Man this mafucka look like Ashton
Combined wit a lil Hugh Jackman
In other words, he's so damn attractive
So damn tan he gotta have a little black in him
Now I'm in the back wit him, sippin on some 'gnac wit him
And he payin for it all, he investment bankin...
I'm acting, like i ain't distracted
But I'm reenacting him and Katie bangin
And now I'm feelin pissed, so I go and take a piss
Mid stream, I look left and guess who it is
And I had to see, and I was mad discrete
And I got on my tippy toes and I took a little peek
Oh my god becky, look at that cock

[Hook 2: Lil Dicky]
And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm lookin at his dick, I can't believe me eyes
Because he's got the biggest cock that I've seen in my whole life
And now I'm starin at this dude's soft dick with a lotta hate
Because the shit is plus 8 like Jon and Kate
And I don't know if I can date ma girl after tonighttttt

Aw damn

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I don't know what to do
Dude's dick is really huge
I didn't realize a penis could be so smooth
I know she's missin that
My penis isn't that
I'm lookin closer I think that his dick has abs
Six pack on a dick
Now what the fuck is that
It's so long and thick
It's like a punching bag
I'm sayin it's so shaven, head is amazing
Got ma dick looking like a raisin
Skin tone insane, man he's hung like Saddam Hussein, it's crazy
What the fuck should I do?
He gotta Ruth's Chris dick, and mine's a drive thru....
I think it's time to
Tell Katie ma goodbyes
Cuz I simply can't survive
After seeing what was in between his thighs
So I tell her

[Hook 3: Lil Dicky]
That this dude's gotta dick that I don't comprehend
I had to move ma neck to see it end to end
I mean the physics of his dick just don't make any sense
And I think it's for the best if this comes to an end
Because the sex with him must have been the best
And I would say let's just be friends
But I think I would just think about his dick all the time, so goodbye
Then she told me Dicky I don't really know what to say
Because I dated this dude in second grade
So I don't know about his dick, now let's go home and get you laid

And then I took her to ma crib, and you know that we barely slept
And I gave her an O like I was selling crack, and when I came
I pulled out and nutted all over her left thigh
And upper mid-section region
You can call that the pelvis
Some would even call that the pubic bone
Leave the pubes at home
Making this up on the spot
Fuck you know about it
I'm about to go paper-mache my own dick and ride it[Verse 1]
Drunk, faded, browned out, looking all shady
Two months since I fucked a lady, young man dick going crazy
Standard Saturday, I'm about to get a cab and masturbate
Then I see a hot girl look back at Dave
Lemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway
That's what I thought not what I said to her
Instead I walk up to her, like "I know you heard of the kid
You heard what I did, you heard of my shit, the murderous spit."
She's like, "Naw, you're being weird, what are you talking about?"
I'm like, "Aw..."
Pulling out my phone, like a boss, YouTube 'bout to get her off
But as I type the y-o-u, some porno pop up
I'm like, "Hold up, how did, that's not even me
Like, I don't jerk off mobily..."
Then her friends coming up
And wanna know if everything is okay
I'm like, "Naw, this a rape, you can't tell?
Gimme a break, please. Get the heck away."
I turned to her, "Let me buy you a drink," she like, "Fine."
Told the man, "Two Patron," she like, "Lime."
Said he tried twice, the card got declined
I'm like, "All ri-, is this a, could it be a machine issue?
He was like, "Naw,"
I was like, "Obviously there's something wrong
I got dough, like I'm not broke...
I got donuts with the same card like about an hour ago."
He like, "Dude, I don't know."
Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go
And I ain't talking 'bout with me, bro, I mean alone
I got one more chance to prove myself, so I'm like

[Pre-Hook]
"Look, I'm athletic, girl, I've gotten several Rec League MVP's
At my crib I've got some pizza, plus a little bit of weed
In my room I've got a TV, plus I recently did sheets
Girl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door
Like with the crushed ice"

[Hook]
You know I don't give a damn, what you playing right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak

[Verse 2]
The girl from the first verse, somehow let me fuck
Fast forward, seven months, we in love
Some real serious relationship type shit
Despite this, I ain't fucked for days
Tried last night, but was pushed away
But I've been acting well behaved today, I smell okay
Adele Pandora's playing, now she laying
On the floor and I'm praying this bitch is horny
I go and give her a smooch
She kissing Dicky back, so I play with her boobs
Bad move, she don't like that
Bad mood, her boss being mean to her
Via email, she wanna write back
I'm like, "Right now?"
She like, "Yeah, what do I say, can you just help me?"
"Oh, okay, what's the context?"
Then she like, "Well, he talks to Jane before coming to me."
"Who's Jane again?" I said, she like, "Wow, you should know that..."
"Okay, I guess I forgot," she like, "Dude, that's my other boss."
"Okay, true, so shouldn't your first boss
Go to the other boss, before you? Right?"
"But Jane isn't hands on!" she yelled
"Okay, well I just don't understand the dynamic then
I don't work with these people." She started crying
"Wait stop, what the fuck is this?"
"Naw, you don't ever take my side."
About an hour later til' I'm on her good side
We in bed, hands on her good thighs
I try to kiss, she like, "Good night" but I'm like

[Pre-Hook]
"Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee
I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing and weed
Yesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet
And supportive aunt during the fourth quarter, of the Eagles
Now reward it.."

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fast forward some more, June sixteenth, twenty seventy four
Old LD looking old as fuck, still with the same ho, holding up
But my life sucks, legs hurt, friends dead, real terse
My dick looking like it's tinfoil
Her tits looking like they hard boiled eggs
On top of that, she insane
Like, I don't even think she knows who I am
Our kids moved away, we've been doing the same shit for days
Maybe months, who knows, probably going to die soon
Pretty scared, I ain't even gonna lie to you
Think about it all day, on my last legs
But I'm going out with a bang
I got pills they invented back in fifty seven
I took five, that's a bit excessive
I look high, take a look at my thighs
And good God that's a little erection, it'll work though
Now I've gotta find the ho, I'm pretty much blind at this point
I don't know if I mentioned that yet, but I am
Made my way into the bedroom and there she is, I'm like

[Pre-Hook]
"Look, I don't know if you're aware that
You've been throwing out my shoes
What I do know is, I'm sick of doing nothing here with you
All my blood is in my dick, I'm probably dying pretty soon
Are you even comprehending what I'm saying
Please acknowledge that you hear me..."

[Hook]I like to play it cool like I'm not that
On the low who’d assume that I got that?
I don’t know but the dude with the tall frappe
Looking aloof, being all that
Even Babe Ruth wouldn't call that
I don't even sweat it tho
Baby had some tinnerz and my credit low
But the shit will hit em quicker then an edible
I'm bout to run for Senate ho
You won't even centerfold
Then on top of cheese I'm ain't talking about oregano
I'm talkin' about yo cheddar homie
I hit a college and I’m fucked like I’m pledging a frat
They bout to silhouette up my nuts on american flags
Estoy contento, I'm muy estupendo
Everybody know the cat like a dope meme
I got em buzzin' on the crack like a dope fiend
They saw em' come up with a Mac ya I'm so Steve
Now a days bitches tryin' crack got em od-ing
How them hoes wanna get it with L
They know its cold enough to charge like a letterman sale
If they gonna stand behind the bars I'm in federal jail
I’m goin’ far like a general mail
Sway I got the fellas sayin what up
The tape what up
Same muhfucka playing with the steak cut up
I'm great shut up
The flow ain't no debate, just us
I’m out of shape, but I’m straight to fuck
You know I got a chicken in the condo
I'm was sick of getting off beat she a bongo
She playing with the hard D, Rondo
Go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow
How imma do?
I got your X comin' next like a W do
I gotta flex I'm the best now I'm being direct
I'm unimpressed by these bitches that are seein' the press
I kinda of vexxed by the trash like I'm cleanin' the mess
Cuz they as real when they rap as a chias a pet
Old news stocks plummet, mens leg hair, they dont cut it
Forget about your era, Pat Summit
Best writtens, I'm trying to get a hundred bitches to fuck with the spittin religious like a couple of us marital Christians
Been official Dick Bevetta A livin
Let a ticket like you bitches got a mill and a ditch
And I'm killin' this shit i can kick it like a villainous ninja
Creeping when i run it how the fuck i be slippin'
I be in it wit them hoes she never flung us
Take chick, pee and smash, I call her hummus
And I be funny with this shit I'm just playing
Still nobody fuckin' with the kid I'm just sayin'
Got a chicken parm on a date, ya see
But I don't even know the broad she just gratin the cheese
I don't even got a job I just blaze and free
But straight up get it boy bands 98 degrees
So come fuck with em
I got a couple bitches doin' drugs with me
I got a couple dozen bitches tryin' to hug Dicky
And i got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me
Aye that's a good ass life
Only thing i got left, find a good as wife
But yo I gotta hit these hoes first, don’t tell mom
In a year I'mma bend over Michelle Obama
I gotta do it while I'm hot
Trying to get blue in all them states like Barack
I’m tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock
And put up on d til we owe J watt
I never hit the scene
When I'm do I'm high n wasted
I'm fuckin' with them jeans

You a player but I’m Naismith

If everybody had to tell the truth, and you had to pick a dude spittin better than ya dude, can’t do it, Sway talk to em[Intro]
Wassup, wassup y'all
L-D aka Young Dick

Had to make a track about smoking weed, man
Every rapper got a track about smoking weed so I didn't really have a choice
But, I guess I made mine a little bit different is all
It's like, it's like, it's like

[Verse 1]
Blowin something sticky word to pre-cum dicks
I'm wit ma team in this bitch, and we all getting lit
I mean the weed hella loud, like a teenage chick
And we been smoking for a minute, yeah we blowin on that ganja
And now I'm huffin and puffin, I'm choking on that bong
And the dope I'm on is bomb I'm smoking that Vietcong
Getting real high
Watching funny videos of Bill Nye
Tell me that this jam isn't still fly --

*Bill Nye Skit*

Now I'm getting hungry than a muthafucka
Put some chicken nuggets in the oven at 400
Where'd I put that honey mustard
Lookin all around the cupboard for that muthafucka
Until I discovered a custard, I covered wit butter from last week
How long do them thangs keep?
Guess I better ask Jeeves
Go get ma computer but I'm staring at the damn screen (wow)
Damn D, you forgetting what ya task be
The puff puff pass, gotcha gassed
Now ya man is fucked

[Hook]
And I was tryna get a little buzz, so I took a little puff
But I think I'm way too high
And I ain't wanna come off like a bitch, so I took another hit
But I think ma brains too fried
And yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it
I'm praying that I make it
Afraid I'm goin to dieeeee
I'm too blazed, it's too late
To save Dicky from this fuckin place, cause he too high

[Verse 2]
Now I'm freakin out up in this bitch
Can't control it and ma homies passin round another spliff
So I bolted to the BR
Consulted with the mirror
Lil Dicky please step up, you pathetic
Cause the weed in you beating you
Then all a sudden I'm on the toilet beating ma penis blue
But I ain't cummin because as I'm imagining fucking something
That pretty girl I'm humping
Becoming my fuckin cousin, or mother or brother
Or some other fucking disgusting person
Ma brain is bein strange, cause I'm high as a plane
I ain't deranged, I'm just saying it's a violent strain
So I go back to the back where they packing up cigars
Dipping snacks, kicking back, staring at some Avatars
Then I flipped, took a decade and a half to make that shit
Yet they couldn't put a second and a half up in that script
How the fuck a human being wanna fuck a
Blueish green 7' 3'' tail having ass thing
Man I'm high as fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rock hard cock, cause I'm watching Katy Perry
And in her video the whole world's made of candy (wow)
Damn, I ain't even got no candy
So now I'm at the fucking C store
Where ya man be torn than a mafucka
Peanut m&m's or a Twix
Can't commit, so I count the benefits on ma hands
Goddamn now I'm weary of the man -- yeah the cashier
Homeland, Nazir!
S-s-s-so damn tweaked I can't even cross the mothafuckin street
Gotta wait until that muthafucka's green
Now I'm back up at the crib, and I'm laughin at giraffes long necks
Gotta shit, but the path to the bathroom is complex
Crafted a long text, took about an hour
Took a scary shower, now I'm sitting naked on the ground
Man I'm fucked up. I'm bout to call ma mom up and tell her what's up
This sucks I'm high as fuck

[Hook][Hook]
And y'ain't even want it wit da boy
Cuz the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

[Verse 1]
Shit, i'm living good up in this bitch
Dicky rollin round the city, blowin good up in that wip
I ain't black or Dominican, not Hispanic or Indian
So imprisonment is not a predicament, I envision
For a white boy
Holl atcha muthafuckin kike, boy
Higher than a muthafuckin kite, it's aight boy
They ain't suspicious of Jews
Ill show contrition it's cool
Slap on the wrist, get ma daddy to choose
One of them top lawyers dat be rollin round in his crew
I'm eating chop soy and bowlin on a carnival cruise
Das what I do kid
Happy that my name ain't stupid
Dave coulda been Daquan wit a few kids
But now I'm farting, overeating at meals
If ain't I gotta theme party, Ion't be at goodwill
I'm dentist paying, tennis playing, smellin on some cabernet
And I ain't gay but if I was, everything would be okay, look...
I know I'm being condescending in ma rhymes
But ma premium channels mean Tyler Perry's never live
Getting tickets, they sick, I sit at the eagle 45
Where I'm eating when I'm high's where they eat at to survive (food chains)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah. It's little DI in this bitch ho
Happy that I'm white, but relieved I ain't a chick yo
I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up
Or straighten hair, I ain't given a damn
I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka
They up in heels
And tummy tuckin, they don't grub except for takin' them pills, foreal...
And ion't bleach shit
Ion't gotta eat dick
I ain't bleeding up out ma penis
Smoking the weed, ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing
In disagreements, I participate without weeping
And when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that
Ma rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut
So what up
Ya boy cut up
But eat butter
And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother...to still love her
And I been getting better looking with age
But a guy can get who he deserves wit a horrible face
*Seal interlude*
I go on dates, and never have to worry bout getting raped
And I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played
And I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake
And if impregnate I can pack a back and be on my way, but good luck girl!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah... I'm happy as fuck man
First off I'm a dude so
There was a one in two chance of that sucking
But now I can run a seven minute mile
I can defend my self adequately
I can be logical
I can get along with my room-mates
Watch serious movies without being scared by them
And the on top of that I'm white
Which is like, amazing because
Everybody naturally assumes I'm a great person
I get a fair shot at the life I deserve
I mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country
I get my hair cut at a salon
People hold the door open for me which is nice
Er, I never have to get into a fight, like, for social purposes
And please don't take this as me just disparaging black people
It ain't about that
It's about me being happy that I'm white, know what I'm saying?
But on that note, could someone explain to me why Fat Joe, and any other person of Hispanic descent, is allowed to say the N-word
I mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense
I've been thinking about that shit a lot
Because like if I could say the N-word, it would really help my rhyme scheme out
It's like the perfect filler word[Intro: Lil Dicky]
Yeah
Eh this gon' be the shit that when motherfuckers hear it
They gon' be like 'Damn, that dude can rap'
Know what I'm saying?
Like, like, like, like

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Look, I'm the man bro
Iont really care what the fuck you think
Steak look rare but I grub dat pink
And the grundle stink
And I bump N-sync
Don't suck dick, but I blow dat good
Don't want shit but a ho that would
Lemme hold dat, bend and fold that
Get a Kodak, cowboy, Jerry Jones dat, lemme own that
Word...fuck that girl
Jew got hair, never cut them curls
Truth or dare wit a cute au paire
Get a room to share, hit a boom, Pat Burrell
Spit dat turd, das dat shit
Gotcha girl up on ma dick
I'm bout to sperm up on dem hips
Don't wanna murder us a kid
Oh shit...whatchu say
Don'tchu do this erry day?
Don'tchu usually go wit double meat when you eat chipotle
Don't your crew lack someone black, but you want one to hang no slave
And I heard your boo got so much back like she bangin' that Notre Dame clock
Faded tho
Fuckin bitches you'd label undateable
Missing birthdays, hay belated brah
Naked out in san fran on that rooftop
I got tan cans, no tube top
Cuz I'm the mafuckan man goddamn
And these mafuckas bitches full a shit like zoo mops so

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
Look, you can do it, you can say it
I been through it, you can play it
Yea I'm jewish, so I'm praying das yo boo cuz I'mma take her
Dinner at the crib, feedin kobe like a laker
You know what it is, I'm a mafuckan K-I-K-E
You don't play wanna play D
Goin down low on ya dame
Getcha mafuckin weight up
You can find a cracker getting paid like a sedar
All day
Word up
All K

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Whoa, afikoman in a flow, das a pro
Whatchu know bout dicky creamin up in hoes
No ho ho
Whatchu know about a balla
Born and raised on the kaballah
Tryna make a dollar, until I'm cakin and stackin challa
I'm hollerin atcha daughter like when the fuck you tryna get it
Dat vagina fitted custom for fucking this little dicky
Puffin' sticky while she bangin' on my wood
Superstitious , pussy good
Cooter vicious, within a minute I finished
But I ain't trippin off no quick nut
And no pain in the butt, ma shit's tough
And my dick's sucked, and yo dick sucks
But real talk I could never give an inch up
We tippin cups in the strip club, no flip cup
Wit a fit butt rubbin on my Nike zip up
No whisenhunt, but them bad bitches get cut
Gotta get up so the dick tucked
What the fuck you doin
This that heavy fuckin flow
Word to pads
Wearing out a lotta boxes on the road
Word to plaid
And I gotta have my pops no cereal
Das word to dad
Watching Breaking Bad, fucking wit' Hank and sippin tab boi

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
Yeah, I'm saying
If they can say the N word
I sure as fuck can say Kike
Do something about it, pussy[Intro]

Hey what's up y'all?
It's ya boy Dicky, AKA Yung Dick
A$AP Rocky beat
A$AP, fuckin' witchu
If you tryna like, get on a track, collaborate, I'm wit it
Or like
Even if it's like just getting brunch
I get brunch, if you wanted to
I don't know if you get brunch but you should
My treat
So, alright, hold up

[Verse 1]
Yo
Riding through ya city, tryna find some titties
I'm high enough to think I might be dying, word to Whitney
Vagina, chicken, sticky, that's all you gotta give me
And I'm bout it, bout it, ain't no doubt about it
Lil dicky ehh?
Heard he spit that witty ridiculously, offensive shit
Heard he got expensive shit, heard that he resent his dick
You heard right muthafucka
I'ma a bright, coy, white boy, kike muthafucka ehh?
So whatchu fittin to do
I got a bitch she brought a bitch now ma dick dinner for two
Okay das fiction but admit it that I'm spittin it smooth enough
To get a jew wit some scruff to mack a beauty wit boobs and a butt
And plus a flat ass navel, twistin' that, no dreidel
From the back so fable of me (woof)
Cream cheesin , philly bred - so bagel of me
When dicky dead, this is never gonna be..so

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And I been rollin wit a fatty
Boneless chicken patties
Been clubbin like this muthafucka's rollin wit a caddy
And now that I been rappin, all these bitches holla me
Had to put a daily cap on the head, no Aladdin
Know I'm average looking, and I'm bragging bout getting chickens
But this spitting got me positioned to be banging out bitches
Outta ma league...Jeff Teague bangin on Griffey
Would never happen less you happen to be hanging wit dicky
Oh yeah I'm white, killin brothas like im up in the klan
Been fucking fly faced honeys like I'm up in sudanm so damn!
I'ma spit it till I get a buggatti
And body two hotties, who bodies
Fugazi, punanis tsunami -- das wet
Puffin sticky, you ain't fuckin wit lil dicky
Bumpin biggie, humpin giddy
Cummin quicker than ma internet
I got high speed internet
Spittin mad ignorant
Sicker than a muthafuckin immigrant

Outro[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
I gotta problem with ma dick
Been hatin on him since I was a kid
Way before I ever put him in a bitch
Goin back y'all
Never wanna trash talk
So I made a track we could rap on
Keep us intact
And I know the fact is that you jewish
But I don't want no excuses for ya size
I know hella jewish guys who grew up between them thighs but no
You actin like you was four
You haven't changed since we young
It's sad you that immature
And I don't get it, I'm getting bitches, get you in kittens other dicks would die for
But I'm barely hittin it, when a minutes ya high score
And now it's real bad
Cuz you ain't movin on
You twenty something and still live above ya two balls
I been getting nine to five's, but I been keepin us wit bitches that was tryn to ride
But you a mafuckin fiend, and it's mean, we supposed to be a team
You a dick, but I wish I had a penis

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
And this about a dick
Who never took the time to grow
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this
But you gotta stop fucking up ma shit
And I ain't feelin bad
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems
But lay 'em the table, maybe we can solve em
Cuz you and I, we attached at the hip
So we better get this settled up and fixed, right now dick

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Hold up Dicky you ain't really mean it
You got the nerve to tell me you the one mistreated
I don't believe it, it's nuffin but egregious
Cuz I'm the one that's been getting beaten
Obscenely in this mafucka right now
Das a fact, and ma homies from ma sack'll have ma back
You wackin me every mothafuckin day
You acting like it's okay
But imagine waking up feelin' afraid
I'm prayin you stop abusing, but you confused
If you blame me for the ejacs
This about your brain I came because I react
Hope that you concede that
Cuz it's on you, need to distract
What can I do, if you never relax
You see it's actually you that's in control all our faculties
The pre-ejaculatory crap is a sorely inaccurate
Acting like you was deploring me
Warranted insecurity
Scoring, ignoring the forming
Of your own immaturity (not true)
And now the prematurity's on ma head
But you know damn well it should be up on yours instead
But if you loved and accepted me then that wouldn't be a problem
Instead I'm in a dick numbing condom

[Hook 2: Lil Dicky]
And this about a kid
Who never took the time to grow
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this
But you gotta stop fucking up ma shit
And I ain't feelin bad
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems
But lay 'em the table, maybe we can solve em
Cuz you and I we attached at the hip
So we better get this settled up and fixed, right now kid

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
Dicky:
Wow, I think you need to get a grip dude

Dick:
I'd say the same, but I'm betting that you will soon

Dicky:
Real funny dick, I can't even stomach this
How you gonn act like I'm wacking ya shit for nuffin
He frontin up in this mothafucka, bluffin on the beat
Wouldn't beat him without a reason he sung it incomplete

Dick:
Tell me why then

Dicky:
Why you always tucked in ma jeans
It's cuz Im wit a woodpecker like I'm stuck in a tree

Dick:
Well I confess I'm erect on occasion
But up in the Bahamas --

Dicky:
Hold up we that was a vacation

Dick:
Is that what you call it, as I recall
You was mauling me day and night
Only sex you got was dry, aggressively rubbing fly
I was chaffed up. You the fuckin problem dicky wake up

Dicky:
Well what about the time you wasn't stayin up?
I was wit a top 5 dime of ma life

Dick:
Well you the guy that was drinkin all the goddamn wine
Fuck that, you a cold, crooked mafucka, where's your heart

Dicky:
And you a toad looking muthafucka, Mario Kart

Dick:
So this is it?

Dicky:
This is it, you a dick I need a penis

Dick:
No you a dick, I need a human being

[Hook 3: Lil Dicky]
So this shit about a kid (dick)
Who never took the time to grow
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this
But you gotta stop fuckin up ma shit
And I ain't feelin bad
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems
But lay 'em the table, maybe we can solve em
Cuz you and I we attached at the hip
So we better get this settled up and fixed, right now dick[Intro]
LD, AKA The Independent Variable
Trap God, and we servin' up the whole world

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Ay, where the gold at, baby?
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?
Ay, where the dough at, baby?
And the banger but you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)
Ay, we gon' save that money
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on them
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L, The Jew Biz Major?
Fuck you know about the world he was raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away
Book flight December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get login's for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thotties, I disregard them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin', preacher
I can take his ass church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burb like a baby without no hiccup
I can...

[Interlude]
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know a full verse would have been to expensive anyways
I think

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie
Hair cut several months in-between, homie
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave, homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Air B&B the mother fucker, least I'm never there
I'm not in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it
401k rollin' over bands on it
Coppin' sweaters in the summer with the sail on it
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpay for it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count, hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shiz though
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin finch tho
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Kept the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Fetty Wap]
Everytime these niggas tryna play
And lately I've been stackin' up
Cause I'm bout the bands baby
100k underneath the bed baby

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing a long like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you
Than it need be, so think about it take a minute let it breathe B
But think about it bruh you saw me take the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp up in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kyke know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that [snicker]
You didn't... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassedYeah fuck you think you dealin' wit
Every time ya hear da the kid you know he bout to kill dis shit
Every rhyme is sicker than an ugly bitches period
You know the Jew is building something I ain't talking pyramids
Them bitches wit titties they wanna get up at the kid
They instant messaging Dicky, they wanna get up on his dick
But I ain't ready to hit it, because I'm relatively timid in the bed I admit it
But fuck that gay shit we should fuck soon
Baby whatchu wann do
Tell me when to come through
Take you out to ritas then I'll skeet up where dat tongue blue
D could tweet a freak till I'm peekin' up at a cheek and that physique'll
Have me jackin' ma D if I don't agree to meet at her at her fucking condo
Eat it like a combo
Need it in the mourning or I'm heated like Alonzo
You know that the geek about mack up an actress
Imagining McAdams all on ma mattress
Attackin' ma sack and attractively crackin', ejaccin', we nappin'
The fuck you think you doin'
I'm rappin' some crack and I'm lackin' the practice cause the Jew
Dat's been smackin' the track up and snappin' has actually been doin'
This shit, renewing the spit, for one year
Fuck it tho
Think you better read about ma fuckin' flow
I'm smoking weed wit clueless bitches cheatin' playin' suck and blow
Eatin' on some buffalo chicken fingers on a boat
Went from being honor roll to spreadin' like he on a roll
Haha...Whoa
Okay now I'm on a roll
Scoring got em screaming commentators speaking on a goal
Tourin' writing TV, getting greedy but I'm honorable
I swear dat Dicky isn't that conceited but I think it's time to
Roll another spliff, and we blowin' that
Salt and vinegar up in the whip, yea I'm holdin' that
Bitches droppin' back up in shotgun like they was Flacco or Rodgers
I'm doin 60 so I tell em to stoppit, I need to concentrate
The hoes know DI, been goin' MIA
I'm in the four door Fiat, wit poquilla
Bitches das been showin' me interest
Seen up on Pinterest
Don't know how it happened but Lil Dicky back in business[Intro]
Yessir, What's good
Look, I feel like every great rapper has one of these man
No hooks, just bars
Let me catch my breath right quick, Let's go!

[Verse]
What it do, was twenty-two up my the room
Thinkin' bout a way that I could make a move, make a boom
Debated to move to L.A. to make it in movies
But traded the pool shade and gravitated to music
Now I'm spittin' the hottest shit, it don't matter the competition
Is sadder than a bladder that be lackin a pot to piss in
It's actually kinda sicknin', the rap is beyond horrific
Admit it bruh, Waka Flocka Flame is somehow respected?
The game has gotta change, used to listen to Jay
Up on the train, now they floodin' the waves with 2 chainz
I feel like I separate with my lines like 2 lanes
It's a dark knight when the joker's better than them banes
Of the rap game, all of 'em rap lame
They claimin' all em ballin', well then all of em Sac Kings
At least they in the league tho,I can't even cop a fuckin peacoat
That's why I'm aiming outside the box, like it's a free throw
The weed smoke fuckin the air up
Got this muthafucka snackin more than Miggy Cabrera
Got this mafucka rappin some crack and yappin about it on his cell phone
Tell holmes this is the track, that I got ma swell on
And I spit that shit so fast sometimes I need to slow it down
All these bitches up in the crib, it's like ma home a pound
Tell me I ain't hold it down
Spittin ridiculous, ticklin' bitches
Up into they britches, and rip em like tickets
And fastballs, lookin' at a cutie on the dance flo'
I visualize that booty wit the pants off
Had a little dance off, and I ain't had no shot it was the ass fault
Cuz shawty body arguably hotter than august asphault
They claimin' they great, man these rappers straight lebronin'
I'm layin' in wait, to smack the fuck up out dat spauldin'
I'm hatin' every song, they celebratin' poppin' Dom
But I be takin' shots a brandy like a kobe at the prom pic
Bomb shit, ya'll should see ma muthafuckin' blonde bitch
The bombs on dat body shawty just gotta be Islamic
I twist and I turn her on 'til she wet like she a faucet
No rapper give you more a set...isn't it ironic?
Because I'm seein' these labels
Pumpin' out the horseshit, got me callin' 'em stables
Pumpin' out the tours quick, but they ain't makin' hits
Ain't nobody great as this
White boy killin' brothers on that Cane and Abel tip
Tri-tip steak, up on a plate, I'm on a date
Wit a dime bitch, nibbling cake
But nevermind that, Someone tell me where the fuck the rhymes at
I was bumpin' Nas in his prime and you gonna sign that?
Oh well, guess I'm better than they'll ever be
I could do it serious but they prefer the levity
I ain't really hearin' nothin'
Say I ain't the man
I'm layin' in sand, zero spf for the tan
But now I'm back in this muthafucka, spit hotter than a flamethrowa
Waitin' to hear em call on ma name like rap a game show
Tell me this is lame, though I know that is bogus
Gotta focus, be the dopest, with the most set of quotes, and the grossest
When I flow sick, and the hope is
Notice is right around the corner, my time to shine
Is almost aligned, something like a quarter to nine
If I could have a quarter for the metaphors in my rhymes
I'd only have a couple dollas so I'm stickin' wit dimes (ya know)
They getting off like a train stop
I'm lookin' at ma dick like how the fuck do you stay rock
No Southern Carolina, how you got so much game cock
Cuz you movin' that vagina in the dark like a stage prop
It's all good, I'm making this the outro
I had to fuckin' spit, this is what I'm about bro
And you know what it is, holla back up at the kid Slim Boner
So damn hard, this shit is overVerse 1

Middle of the week, ain't nobody at the crib (uhh)
Chillin in the bed wit a hard ass dick (uhh)
And you Dicky need that
Where the fuck the weed at
Dis about to be a fuckin treat

You can find me tryna beat dick
Lookin for a freak bitch
I ain't fittna pay for it, fuckin wit dat free shit

Loadin up a page, porn hunting like a genius
Baby, I make it rain, cetaphil up on the penis

Find the kid up on youjizz loadin two vids
Both dem bitches point of view and
Finding new shit, can't decide to sort by rating or the view hit
Goin stupid, whatcha know about a window full a tabs
And all of them bitches pretty fuckin bad ya dig it

The type bitches gotchu thinkin bout they past (uhh)
Could a been a model, now a fist up in dat ass (uhh)
Bet she wasn't coddled, ain't had no a father
So shawty hit the bottle, gotta toddler
And needed dollars, I swear I hit the lotto with these

Low self esteem having fine ass bitches
Got me loadin, got me streaming, closing blinds, lights dimming
Baby, im about to blast off
Ballin wit my pants off
So if you was lookin for ya man

Chorus:

You can find me in the bedroom beatin on ma dick
Homie I'on't give a fuck, I'm just tryna find a clip
Only fuckin wit a hi definition type a bitch
That can suck a dick...man, this a fuckin hit...

Verse 2

Okay you know I'm searchin jenna haze, heather i
Rollin j's and getting high
Almost started creaming seeing mini-skirted haley wilde

Rollin over thumbnails
Lube up in ma thumbnails
Top rated page 21
It's taken me kinda long, but I'm scrollin wit ma dick out
I roll a little zag, yea das word to dan dickau

I'm higher than penthouse
Vagina booty and mouth
You prolly redtube-ing, like a pre-pubescant kid out this muthafucka

I'm havin trouble cuz her dude is fuckin wit rubbers
I know it's subtle, but it's covered, and if I had my druthers
Then I would need to see the skin touch
Maybe that's a bit much
Either way, if you wanna play

Chorus:

You can find me in the bedroom beatin on ma dick
Homie I'on't give a fuck, I'm just tryna find a clip
Only fuckin wit a hi definition type a bitch
That can suck a dick...man, this a fuckin hit...

Verse 3

Last week, tried to suck my own dick ehhhh
Don't try n act like you ain't try that shit at least once

But now I'm back jackin dat wit a mac
No klan, but I stay away from blacks
And ion't take it back, I just can't even relate to it
Lookin like a pussy got a porterhouse steak through it

Hate it when a mafuckas dick is as a big as a 4 loco
Type a girth, that ain't even of this earth ya dig it

I'm dodging pop ups like a muthafuckin vet in this bitch
The door is locked I got the toilet paper ready and ripped
I'm talkin X-art tan hoes
Bangbros passcodes
So if you was lookin for ya man

Chorus:

You can find me in the bedroom beatin on ma dick
Homie I'on't give a fuck, I'm just tryna find a clip
Only fuckin wit a hi definition type a bitch
That can suck a dick...man, this a fuckin hit...Verse 1:

Cause if you really talkin' shit bruh
I suggest you take a sec and recognize ma shit raw
I been texting pictures atcho sister, be ma in law
You know I been spittin' vicious, whatchu fittin' to get at ma dude
I been killin' bitches, Michael Vick in the booth
The US see me, I be kiffin to you
I gotcho bitch up on ma stick she ride it sick
Like it was quidditch but nude
And I'm the honorary Gryffindor Jew
And I don't care about ya bitch, or ya ya, ya riches or ya wips bro
Even tho you fictional, I'm guessing that you get dough
No you don't exist, but I see through you like a window
Dicky run this shit and you'sa cripple
Fuck it though, you dumber than Waka Flocka
Be sonnin you like a father
D bomber than Osama plot
And smart as Obama
Gotcho lil mama in the sauna all up
In the male locker room
She really good with the D
That's my Serge Ibaka boo, ooh
Das dat dude, spittin hot as Rihanna
You softer than llamas
Do prima donnas faster than ramadan
I'll be honest, getting commas in ma wallet

Been flowin nice as the Dalai Lama
Whaddup bruh
I'm goin stupid cuz I'm better
This the hottest shit like I was pooping in a sweater
Ain't nobody do you anymore, you a letter
You get it write? That was clever
Ho'
But look

[Hook]
If you think you on ma level jabroni
Than let me educate you, bet you need a fellowship homie
Lil dicky rippin dat ribbon cuz what he spittin' is winning
So if you finna be some chicken for dinner
Then hollaback up at the kid boy
I'm spittin' good up in this bitch ho
So if you wanna get at me, you better get a Mento, ahhh
That's word to ads from the past
Ya ass up in a jam if you come at the man
Then yon't stand a chance

[Verse 2]
Das retard flow
I been talkin game on campuses I'm Lee Corso
Battle me, he'll be like, "Dude I ran." see Argo
Package all up in this dude caboose...free cargo
Fuck it. I'm really talkin that shit
I'm coming at a muthafucka that don't even exist
But if we under the assumption that he
Someone dat spit it redundant to someone incumbent
Then he dumber than bricks ya dig?
Listen to these bitches making hits and
You'll see the horrendousness dat be existing
Every minute some kid is diminishing a single
Written like a semi-retarded kid in kindergarten
Except he harder than me, so poor Lil Dicky is stuck
Watching stupid muthafuckers
Make music and caking foolish
While jewish muthafuckas rate movies
Okay cupid to do a lil fuckin
But if it's bout the rap, they on't want it
That's why I tell em look

[Hook]

[Outro][Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Okay i'm buzzing cause i'm eloquent
Where I'm coming from is hyper-relevant
Cause I ain't seen a ton of us who prevalent
It's nothing but an impediment
I'm yelling "let 'em in" despite the fact my resume
Suggest above a president
I'm fresher than a peppermint
Actually I'm pretty underwhelming
When it comes to fashion and things
Try to focus on the rap, not distracted by things
Probably while when i get on the track I'm lapping the kings
Having a blings not a prio
Vile like a chubby youngin' who stumbled and wondered suddenly up into the snack aisle
Other words indecision was imminent
Rhythm and penman ship had me thinking "be eminemish"
My predicament would lie with my ambition of joke
I'm funny like your favorite comedy when you smoke
So, came to mind i should probably combine em
Bring a lil LD Larry David to rhymin'
In my surprise
A lot of guys
Are quick to categorize
That as a gimmick
Like i'm spittin'
Like a kid who compromising
What is to better fit in
With the rest of the guys whose spittin'
Contradicting with Dicky been about from the beginning
But, I digress it's just a lot to attack
First of all it's really funny how the rest of you rap
If I mumble something dumb about me running the trap
Then i'd be another young redundancy who muttering crap
That'd be hard to defend like i'm playing with fire
Only when i'm mini-golfing is when i'm playing with lies
That would be another foul right?
But i don't reach ref
I like to keep you all abreast
I don't mean chest
If i don't seem stressed
Baby i'm not
Lil David be hot
They bout to put my name on a yacht
But, someone tell me how to judge an mc
Probably think i'm really rapping
If it's lady's I freak
Mercedes I lease
The laziest weak
Delectably chique
Creatively sleek
Basic as tea but sorta
I threw the Spanish in to add swag
But, the way I'm starting to rap with these other tricks
It's like I'm their half dad
And I ain't mad at you no offense
But if you cold bro I know must be snowing pens
Cause if you call homie everybody goin' in
How bout you holla back when you rapping
I'll probably be napping
Or having a snack in the backroom
This is a feast
Way I'm rising on these rappers like I'm made up of yeast
Way I'm sizing up these actors I should hand you a cleat
You goin' in a couple brother and ballin' the scene mean
I don't play with you dog
Wanna muscle with the flow get a spotter involved
You couldn't see me in the post if you blogging my songs
Couldn't see me with the cloak harry potter put on
Couldn't see me like a ghost doin' nothin' at all
I'm taking over and they mad
Father in law Ahh
I'm the best you never heard about
Keep it real
I don't kill, but I murder doubt
It's been a year and I'm here
That's a turn around
Second guess my name, never question what the nerd about
I'm David Bird I'm out
Lil Dicky for word of mouth purposesOk Im buzzin' cause im eloquent
Where im coming from is hyper-relevant
Cause I ain't seen a ton of us who [?]
It's nothing but an impediment
Im yellin letterman despite the fact my resume
Suggestive of a president
Im fresher than a peppermint
Actually im underwhelming when it come to fashion and things
Try to focus on the rap and not distracted by things
Probably why when I got on a track im lappin the kings
Having the [?]
Vile like a chubby youngin who stumbled
In what in suddenly up into the snack aisle[Intro: Lil Dicky]
What's up, y'all?
It's your boy LD
A.K.A. The Original Pancake
I'm going the fuck out tonight

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Off work, 'bout to get trashed
Me and my crew all about to get ass
Sam coming through with a bottle of the Cap
Me and Dean 'bout to tube, Mark taking out the trash
Clean up my room, bitches 'bout to peep that
Peeing, getting groomed, bitches 'bout to eat that
Dean shave my neck, thanks, man, I need that
Read through my text, then I itch my kneecap
Now I gotta play the game right with Liz
Top prospect, met the other night through Tinder
Eight o'clock so I think it's only right I hit her
With a "what you got on tap for the night?", delivered
While I wait Imma pick a shirt
Ain't nobody wearing plaid so I claim it first
Mark got a little sad cause his favorite shirt's plaid but fuck him
He knows I back off in a reverse
Now I'm taking a shot and we drinking and popping a bottle
And thinking of all the bitches we gon' haul in
Sam say I know a house party and it's popping
Bet Imma cop some weird head, Dennis Rodman
Oh, yeah, we plotting

[Chorus x2: Nekisha-Michelle]
This is a pregame
It's a pregame
A classic male pregame
Not a weekday
So this is when we take
Shots and we chasing alternate DJs
And that we pray cause

[Hook 1: Lil Dicky]
And we all get drunk
And we get dressed up
And we all buy gum
And we all gon' fuck

[Interlude: Lil Dicky]
Aye, pour me another shot, God damn it
I'm tryna get to a place where I can talk to these bitches
I got seven shots in me, three condoms on me and immeasurable hope

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Ten O Clock, words getting slurred
Another shot, Sam's tryna hurry
Mark's not, says he isn't worried
He ain't tryna spend hella bread at the clurb
Call him out, "since when you using clurb, faggot"
Mark pouts, something like a herb rabbit
Dean smiles, we been doing work
Pretty turnt, think he blacked out
Lil Dicky burp loud
Peep phone, what the fuck, she ain't text back
Pretty close to considering a text back
Spilling Coke on my shirt that's a red flag
Now I gotta change, Mark knows put his best plaid on
We debating the top ten in the NBA
Disagreeing alot about Lamarcus A
Shawshank Redemption popped on, attention all on
Sam was like, "nah, the party called off"
I already got a Lyft, I'm going out to a bar
Then Mark pulled out a spliff, temptation very hard
You know I couldn't resist, we blazing, now the car here

[Chorus x2: Nekisha-Michelle]

[Hook 2: Lil Dicky]
And we get fucked up
And we all feel rushed
And our plans fall through
And we in bad moods

[Interlude: Lil Dicky]
Man, what time is it?
12:24? And the bars close at 2, lights on like 1:30
Let me just think for like a second

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
Sam like, "we gotta go, cause the car here"
Mark like, "I don't know, what's the bar deal?"
Dean like, "I'm on a roll in Guitar Hero"
Dicky looking like he about to choke on his lamb gyro
Sam looking let down, 'bout to go berserk
Mark put his sweats on, now he rolling purp
Dean blacked out, he ain't even on the earth
I was like, "Sam, I was with it with my other shirt"
Sam bounced, he's like, "fuck it, I'm out"
Me and Mark smoke a blunt, Dean stuck on the ground
Text Liz, "what the fuck?", even snuck in a frown
I get the spins high and drunk, I throw up in the shower
Now I'm jerking off inside a condom (I do that)
I text my ex say, "I miss you often" (true that)
Sam back, it's not even one yet, he a dumb mess
He about to be a problem
I ain't even tripping, I'm Tindering
All of a sudden I'm blinking, I'm squinting
It's saying it's six in the morning
I'm stinking, I'm still in the same shit from last night
Got a text from Mark saying:
"I ain't mad, but I know you’ll clean the bath, right?"

[Chorus x2: Nekisha-Michelle]

[Hook 3: Lil Dicky]
And we get too drunk
And we don't have fun
Then we eat too much
And the next day sucks

[Outro]
Like, we really just wake up and spend far too much time shitting
So, the whole process just seems flawed
Thank you for your timeVerse 1

Friday fucking night
We bout to do this right
Dicky rollin to the club, he about to find his wife

Cuz he fresher than a kid that called his mom a fuckin ho
Bunch a bitches getting low
Pimpin you already know

Im bout to get up on the flo and then bring chicken to ma crib
Getting drunk up in this muthafucka, fuck you think this is?

Then I see a bad bitch wit a booty and a half
I make a move on that cutie, excuse me do you wanna dance

Then she looked at me and laughed
Like I didn't have a chance
Like I shouldn't even asked
So I proceeded to get trashed

And I'm at the bar now, and it's so loud
But I'm takin shots, and I'm throwin down
And I see a pretty lady, so I send her some of that cold brown

And she turned around, and then turned it down
Because in her words, she don't like to flirt with clowns
And I'm alone and pouting, overcrowded, I need to get up out this club

Chorus

I been inside this club for way too long
I wanna leave and eat calzones

None of these females wanna bone
Ma self esteem is all but gone

Verse 2

Bout to quit, but I'm bitter I paid that cover
So I guess I gotta stay in this stupid club a bit longer
And I'm sweating like a jew in a multicultural sauna
They been playing fuckin dubstep for ten consecutive songs

And then I bumped into a guy
He was roughly 6 foot 5
Pretty sure it was his fault, but I apologized

Pretty sure you know the type, probly bankin every night
Vodka sprite, lookin round to find a kike that he can fight
Or suckerpunch, I'm kinda drunk, and I been in the club for way too long
Now I'm up in the corner, all alone, ESPN up on ma phone

Ma self esteem is so depleted, such a mess, I'm overheated
I regretfully just tweeted some depressing shit, I need to leave this club

Chorus:

I been inside this club for way too long
I wanna leave and eat calzones

None of these females wanna bone
Ma self esteem is all but gone

Verse 3

Is this really for the bathroom, are you kidding?
This the type of line where people squeeze they dick to prevent pissing

When I get inside the stall it's like a yeti had been shitting
And there's piss all on the ground, so as I'm wizzing I keep slipping

Fuck this hand stamp
Club is really damn cramped
Fuck it, I'mma suck it up and take another damn chance

Ughh, here goes nothing (c'mon D)

Ay girlie, what's the word
At first glance I may look like a nerd
But if you let me, bet D, get thee, all up in the bed so wet like a mafuckan jetski

Real rap if you tryna go, then put your name right here up inside ma phone
She took bait, no way, typing out her home, she pressed save
Walked away, and her name was no?

Chorus

I been inside this club for way too long
I wanna leave and eat calzones

None of these females wanna bone
Ma self esteem is all but goneMan I ain't even into being curt dude
But ma head blowin up like im the kurt dude
And my friends getting hung up like a shirt do
Now they ain't the only homies fuckin wit da burd dude

This for all ma homies lookin like a nerd who
Got a tennis serve and never broke a fucking curfew
I been getting ready for confetti, from the first boo
Game 6, I ain't bout to finish like the spurs do

Now they tryna get ya guy a deal
Cuz the flow cash money, got a tyga feel
All these majors coming at me like I'm tiger healed
But ion't think the labels know about ya guy foreal

We sittin down, kickin and riffin, diggin the sound
Different from the shit dat's been spittin from typical clowns
Finna give me money in the bag and
Hunnies from the mag and
All the other shit they tell the dummies that can rap

But the fact of the matter is I ain't the rapper
They used to using, confusing, abusing wit da chatter
I mean the dude across the table
Reppin for the label
Probly never met a rapper with a business major

So I am able
To avoid the fatal
Fate that every rapper face in they appraisal

Now I got em thinkin even bartering too
It's probly harder when the fuckin rapper's smarter than you

I came through
Same dude
Same crew
Same jew

And I tell these muthafuckas errything that they ain't knew
Yain't knew? I'm about to get a grammy and leave

Michael Jordan in ma genes since I been 23
Except, I ain't ball playin at all, sayin da bol
Gave all it the game, he played it wrong
Made the songs for the laughs cuz
Funny was the path but
Now I really wanna fuck these dummies in they asses

Practiced
Tell me I ain't climbing up that rap list
I bet a lot of fans'll listened to this and feel catfished

Damn where da Dicky dat I used to know
The goofy flow
Ma dude where the humor go

Well truth be told, I'll put that in a movie, show, or musical
But now I'm in the studio
And dudes in the booth knew that the jew can flow

And if you listenin to this shit, you should know
I'm too cold in this bitch
To be actin a clown
Fuckin around
If I wanna get ma hands on the crown

I'm getting down, letting the smile, beset to a frown now
The kid up from the burbs bout to settle in downtown

But maybe that's a bad move
Maybe I'm a fucking pussy if I'm letting people tell me what I can't do
Maybe all these rappers wanna wear the same shoes
Get into the game and never playing cuz they can't move

Now I'm thinkin what would Jordan do
Back when everybody only wore a boring shoe
If he settled for what every other scorer used
Then you dudes wouldn't ever get the Jordan 2s

I'm snoring through, ya muthafuckin tours and tunes
The game needs change now, it's short a few

And I don't mean to harp about the Jordan dude
But there's a little bit of him in this adoring jew

Of course you, listen to that thinkin I mean I'm great
You mistake, thinkin of rap, and I what I want a play

J wanted baseball
But he nice at playin ball
When he went away, we acting like he went all AWOL

Always got a trade off
I see Jay and Kanye the same way I see Larry David

It's cliché
And I know I'm gonn make it
But I dunno if I prefer as Dicky or as David

I guess it's sorta like the sox and bulls
But I can't leave yet, gotta lot to prove
But I'mma rock ma shoes, watch the toes
And if it hurts, then I'mma find Dr. Scholl's

And...one day, I'mma find satisfaction from rappin
Or acting, or cracking up factions of black kids

Adapting to whatever is in front of me
And like Mike, I'mma be aight because of me

One life, better think of who you wanna be
It's your eyes, doesn't matter what they wanna see

You do it right, you the only one you need to please
You ain't that alive till you doin something you believe

Dis the type of shit that's making D
Think twice bout the mafuckin comedy
Cuz the mic got a mafucka on his knees

Twerk dicky, dicky dicky twerk
Twerk dicky, dicky dicky twerk[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Drinkin' up at summer camp
Itchin' on ma underwear
Dicky got a ton a hair
Money talk, rap game Chris Tucker here
Erry' muggle fuckin wit' me
Going nuts, word to chunky Jiffy
Cold cuts up in the Panini
Mo butt than a Puerto Rican, I been tryna freak too
Nowadays Dicky tryna get a little freak to
Nominate Dicky dick for a little free poon
Honestly, probably rather have a little sweet boo to let me spoon
Fuck it I'm conflicted
Now that the kid been spitting dat
All types a women starting to listen and part of Lil Dicky sorta wishing
For a chick I can build with start to finish
But an even bigger part of me is tryna fuck
All these twitter bitches pictures looking fine as fuck
Been a girlfriend guy for a while and shucks
This the first time dimes been in line to stuff
But, I ain't doin' em all, or doin' em raw
Da boy ain't new to the ballin'
Viewing it all just like
A straight Jew at the mall with loot in the wallet
The restraint engrained up into the ball
But I ain't blue in the balls tho
Got a lil' boo up in law school
Freckles all up over her nostrils
She doing me proper, lotsa pasta, shots of vodka
Tonsil soccer, pop then it's off to clasa hasta manana
Being weird again
There he go Kanye being weird again
Its okay he allowed cause he legendary
But I don't really know how to treat this segment

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky

Sippin' on an Orangina
Bout' to see a foreign feature
Skittles and a quarter reefer
I snuck em both inside the theater
Used to do a ton of math
Now I'm close to doing none of that
I'm bout to hire someone's dad
And he about to do a ton of math
Add it up, rapping crack, gon' stack it up
Back it up ho, das whassup
Cracker jacks at the bank
Cole Hamels up, drank a cup and I'm kind of buzzed
I'm high as fuck, but fuck that
Where them bitches sitting 7th inning finna fuck at
Used to fuck wit bitches that was timid wit the nutsack
Now I'm fuckin' bitches let me jizz up on they buttcrack
Das a fun fact, I'm
Head of ma class and ready for mine
And like a great red in a glass, I'm better wit time
I mean I came letterman jacket, ready to shine
They up designer shit
I'm in footie pajamas bitch
Omelettes, bomb as shit
The rhyming sick
Competish can't conquer dis'
I'm legit, honest chicks is on ma dick
I ain't a god but...you can call me Deezus
Switch to beat up
Ye, I see ya
Bout to make more tortillas
Pork carnitas
Going straight North Korea
Poor Aaliyah
Sorta Lena
Y'all dudes more Madea
Touring, writing, rapping, snoring while I'm napping
Luring these foreign tourists to ma sack and scoring
During performances in the back and
I'm making all of this up because I'm rappin'
Inside a lucky 4 bedroom apartment
That we found on Craigslist and settled in August
You know it was rent control and it was awesome
It came wit' a washer
And a dryer
Goodbye y'allEy what's going on man?
It's your boy Lil Dicky
A.K.A Mr. Leftward-Sloping Penis
I got a story for y'all man
Peep this
Yessir

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Now I been datin this girl named Katie, she hot as hell
And her body crazy, vagina shaven and it dont smell
And I don't fall for chickens
But this one a little different
Body sickening
Plus she really good at making breaded chicken
Got me thinkin she the one man
Even fully clothed, shawty really fun man
Get a lotta hoes, but none of those come close
I swear this the most that I've felt so damn exposedddd
Oh yeah there's one more thing
And I know this shit gonna sound insane
But I still haven't hit it
I admit it, I wish I was kidding
Never been up inside before
Because shes only fucked one guy before
And though I really wanna boink this whore
She ma sweetie 3.14
So I'm stayin patient, and masturbating
And now ma heart is sorta racing
Cuz she said tonight will be the night we do some fornicating
Hell yeah, I'm down, I'm bout to go all out
I'm gonna pound that crazy, like an elaborate black man handshake
But on the way to crib, we pass this kid
And he seem to know who Katie is
So I say "who this" and she say
Dicky, this is my ex boyfriend Jim"

[Hook 1: Lil Dicky]
And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm lookin at this dude I can't believe my eyes
Cuz he's the best looking guy that I've seen in my whole life
He's got the thickest head of hair, chiseled jaw, an egregious bod
Man this the closest thing I've seen to a Grecian god
And now I'm lookin at ma chick, cuz his dick's been inside her rawww

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Awww damn
Man this is crazy
I can't believe this guy used to fuck ma lady
I bet he left that pussy ravaged like Haiti
Katie's huggin and squeezing his shoulder blades
And I'm buggin and queasy, this ain't okay
And then they say, "let's get drinks" so I say okay
Even though I was about to get laid!
Man this mafucka look like Ashton
Combined wit a lil Hugh Jackman
In other words, he's so damn attractive
So damn tan he gotta have a little black in him
Now I'm in the back wit him, sippin on some 'gnac wit him
And he payin for it all, he investment bankin...
I'm acting, like i ain't distracted
But I'm reenacting him and Katie bangin
And now I'm feelin pissed, so I go and take a piss
Mid stream, I look left and guess who it is
And I had to see, and I was mad discrete
And I got on my tippy toes and I took a little peek
Oh my god becky, look at that cock

[Hook 2: Lil Dicky]
And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm lookin at his dick, I can't believe me eyes
Because he's got the biggest cock that I've seen in my whole life
And now I'm starin at this dude's soft dick with a lotta hate
Because the shit is plus 8 like Jon and Kate
And I don't know if I can date ma girl after tonighttttt

Aw damn

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I don't know what to do
Dude's dick is really huge
I didn't realize a penis could be so smooth
I know she's missin that
My penis isn't that
I'm lookin closer I think that his dick has abs
Six pack on a dick
Now what the fuck is that
It's so long and thick
It's like a punching bag
I'm sayin it's so shaven, head is amazing
Got ma dick looking like a raisin
Skin tone insane, man he's hung like Saddam Hussein, it's crazy
What the fuck should I do?
He gotta Ruth's Chris dick, and mine's a drive thru....
I think it's time to
Tell Katie ma goodbyes
Cuz I simply can't survive
After seeing what was in between his thighs
So I tell her

[Hook 3: Lil Dicky]
That this dude's gotta dick that I don't comprehend
I had to move ma neck to see it end to end
I mean the physics of his dick just don't make any sense
And I think it's for the best if this comes to an end
Because the sex with him must have been the best
And I would say let's just be friends
But I think I would just think about his dick all the time, so goodbye
Then she told me Dicky I don't really know what to say
Because I dated this dude in second grade
So I don't know about his dick, now let's go home and get you laid

And then I took her to ma crib, and you know that we barely slept
And I gave her an O like I was selling crack, and when I came
I pulled out and nutted all over her left thigh
And upper mid-section region
You can call that the pelvis
Some would even call that the pubic bone
Leave the pubes at home
Making this up on the spot
Fuck you know about it
I'm about to go paper-mache my own dick and ride itI like to play it cool like I'm not that
On the low who’d assume that I got that?
I don’t know but the dude with the tall frappe
Looking aloof, being all that
Even Babe Ruth wouldn't call that
I don't even sweat it tho
Baby had some tinnerz and my credit low
But the shit will hit em quicker then an edible
I'm bout to run for Senate ho
You won't even centerfold
Then on top of cheese I'm ain't talking about oregano
I'm talkin' about yo cheddar homie
I hit a college and I’m fucked like I’m pledging a frat
They bout to silhouette up my nuts on american flags
Estoy contento, I'm muy estupendo
Everybody know the cat like a dope meme
I got em buzzin' on the crack like a dope fiend
They saw em' come up with a Mac ya I'm so Steve
Now a days bitches tryin' crack got em od-ing
How them hoes wanna get it with L
They know its cold enough to charge like a letterman sale
If they gonna stand behind the bars I'm in federal jail
I’m goin’ far like a general mail
Sway I got the fellas sayin what up
The tape what up
Same muhfucka playing with the steak cut up
I'm great shut up
The flow ain't no debate, just us
I’m out of shape, but I’m straight to fuck
You know I got a chicken in the condo
I'm was sick of getting off beat she a bongo
She playing with the hard D, Rondo
Go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow
How imma do?
I got your X comin' next like a W do
I gotta flex I'm the best now I'm being direct
I'm unimpressed by these bitches that are seein' the press
I kinda of vexxed by the trash like I'm cleanin' the mess
Cuz they as real when they rap as a chias a pet
Old news stocks plummet, mens leg hair, they dont cut it
Forget about your era, Pat Summit
Best writtens, I'm trying to get a hundred bitches to fuck with the spittin religious like a couple of us marital Christians
Been official Dick Bevetta A livin
Let a ticket like you bitches got a mill and a ditch
And I'm killin' this shit i can kick it like a villainous ninja
Creeping when i run it how the fuck i be slippin'
I be in it wit them hoes she never flung us
Take chick, pee and smash, I call her hummus
And I be funny with this shit I'm just playing
Still nobody fuckin' with the kid I'm just sayin'
Got a chicken parm on a date, ya see
But I don't even know the broad she just gratin the cheese
I don't even got a job I just blaze and free
But straight up get it boy bands 98 degrees
So come fuck with em
I got a couple bitches doin' drugs with me
I got a couple dozen bitches tryin' to hug Dicky
And i got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me
Aye that's a good ass life
Only thing i got left, find a good as wife
But yo I gotta hit these hoes first, don’t tell mom
In a year I'mma bend over Michelle Obama
I gotta do it while I'm hot
Trying to get blue in all them states like Barack
I’m tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock
And put up on d til we owe J watt
I never hit the scene
When I'm do I'm high n wasted
I'm fuckin' with them jeans
Love them bitches high-waisted
I run around your team
You a player but I’m Naismith
I command v, why you copy, i just paste it
Face it
Hotel got em puffin on da L
Goin hotter than some hell, y'ain’t knew it
If everybody had to tell the truth, and you had to pick a dude spittin better than ya dude, can’t do it, Sway talk to em[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
It's like, these days dicky been up on his grind
Tryna spit a rhyme
Fly enough to get cracker signed
It's aight tho
I been typing all damn night bro
Kikes gotta write raps right, no typo
Nice flow
Best up in the game, no Michael
I guess I gotta wait for the fame, no lipo
But damn, if ya man had a hoard of fanbase
I'd have a lot to cover like a corpulent klan face
Go on some man dates
Wit D'Caprio and Drake
And make a man cave full of chronic and pancakes
A handshake's all I'm really wantin from LeBron tho
Iono
Think I'd rather get up wit his mom
And do it delonte, couple bottles of Andre
In pompei, getting dirtier than some laundry
I'm freakin that ho, just for Cleveland man
But first thing I'mma need some fans

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
Cuz little dicky tryna make that cake, like a balla do
And denigrate little wayne up at a bar-b-q
And I just wanna hit the floor wit pauly D
And cross swords up wit Tommy Lee
So where the muhfuckers drinkin the ciroc at
Where the fuck the rock at
Where the bad bitches on this mediocre cock atttt
I'm tryna make the move
From gay, lame, dateless jew to famous dude, ya dig?

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
First grade and I was thirsty
I was wantin fame up in the muthafuckin worst way
Word play, gotta get ya ya boy up on some first take
Skip Bay, Steve A, get up in they ass ya dig
If I'm celebbin then I'm getting wit mccadams's
The hottest women on the muthafuckin planet kid
I'm tryna get up at Selena
Mess around wit mila
I remember when it was Christina
Genie up in a bottle, but now she couldn't fit up on a waterbed
I wanna score a ten imagine Natalie portman
And if she borin then, ill get a ride in ma DeLorean
And go before it, securing the whore I been adoring since
I was a teen, ya mean
Brittany spears, whacha doin
Couple years, dat career and dat metabolism ruined
Yain't know about me yet
But the future do
On youtube, I been getting some views

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
Ay, enough about a boo, ion't need a bitch
But I need a clique
Full a people Derek jeterish
Love the bieber kid
That's a hell of a dude
Well I ain't met him but his documentary was the truth
I'd holla back at snoop, drop a couple tracks in the booth
He'd prolly have me high enough to take a nap as I poop
I'm callin kobe Bryant up because I'm fucking wit his game
But it's such a shame, I can tell that muthafucka lame tho
Flame flow
Ain't nobody even know ma name tho
And all I wanna do is know if channing's really gay tho
All I wanna do is play Durant up in some Halo
Play shows, date hoes, where the fuck diddy at
Where lil dicky gonn spit at
And where the crib at
And where da rose gold shit at
I'm tryna get dat
I wish dat I was sitting courtside for games
And lickin on Kate Upton's titties

[Hook][Verse 1: Lil Dicky]

Iight, I'm blowing on that sticky shit
Everybody's talking, bitches stalking, quick as Lawson
When I'm walking to the gym and shit
Everybody wanna get involved with the Dicky kid
I don't even know the deal y'all, I'm just killing shit
I ball like I'm playin the wii
Hit up all da ATMS, I been paying the fees
Being gay about the stems, Dicky weighing the weed
And now these labels on a cleanse, got em saying
We need jews, oh the dude the scoop boos
Boozing stupid and he rap bruising tunes amusing students
I'm the truth dude
Put some funny shit up on youtube
Now these mafuckas spitting looking shitty as doo doo
Who knew, ya dude got a lot to do
I don't fill them bitches up, but the lobster do
Plus she licking on my nut like it's pasta too
And now that Dicky blowing up all these bitches so compliant
These days dicky gotta cover up his privates
Bathroom pissing brothas buzzing on some spy shit
Man, I wish that my dick was a little bigger
Because I'm in a pickle for riddles about ma pickle
Being minimal, criminally abysmal and literally
Women I'm hitting is cognizant of every centimetre
And I'm meeting bitches who seem to be fucking Derek jeter's
Every weekend, very freaky, don't know what I'm doing to em
These bitches do the type of shit chicks in porn doing
Bathroom beating on my dick, right before I do 'em
Man that's my only chance, ya know
I'm handsome though
I gotcha lady dancing bro

[Hook]
Man ever since I came up in this motherfucker shit been changed
Every rapper getting madder 'bout the funny shit I'm saying
They be trapping, I be napping, steady crapping on the game
And like a rabbit out the hat I'm doing magic wit the flames man

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]

Better stop comparing me to Andy Milanokis
Andy Samberg, Adam Sandler, man I swear it's so obnoxious
I don't care about the rarity of care-free song topics
The hilarity and parody is not whats got you noddin when I write
On the mic spit, nothing like a white kid
Black bitches even fucking with me cause I'm nice wit
Raps, booty big as shit, I'm in it but she quite thick
Crap, from this angle I can barely fit the pipe tip
Like da the white man bright, and me don't bite
And me won't fight, me done watch da dark knight with a cold sprite
And me so kike, kite runner up on da cold night
And me done scrub de body with ton of the old spice

[Interlude]

But fuck it
My buddy got a crib Nantucket
And everybody here with a bitch straight fucking
And everybody here know the kid stay bumpin'
My YouTube, Smith up on the Knicks, they subbing...aww
I just checked up in yo bitch's pussy up on 4square
Mini golfing oh so often you woulda swore I toured there
Break 'em off up in my office you know I record in there
It's boring there so fuck it
I been caking, don't mistake me for some rapper you hating
I'm actually making the hottest fucking tracks in the nation
Like Satan somehow created some elaborate gymnasium
Packing bowls in stadiums, came from packing the bowl in basements
Name a rapper in the game, spit a flame like you boy can
Everybody know I got it made like a boyband
Everybody know I'm getting laid like a Troy fan
I stay with Trojans on ma shit, ya dig?

[Hook][Intro]
LD, A.K.A. the urologist, this my year, show them D

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm 'bout to do it all
I don't think I'm stopping, 'til it's mountains of my balls
Y'all like, oh dear, like I'm mounted on the wall
But the way I'm 'bout it, 'bout it my accountant getting mauled
His wife 'bout to leave his ass
He been working all night, while she give him baths
Actually, I'm pretty light, like, within his tasks
He got bigger clients, but I'm nice, so just let me bask
These white bitches let me smash
I get scared though, no bravado
Third base for the O's, like Machado
Miss, I ordered this with Avocados, thanks
Ey, walk up in this bitch, like I was born bread
Going deeper with this spitting, like some porn head
Picture every rapper laying on the floor dead
While I'm in a chair, cross legged, eating corn bread
I just fucked a black chick, yeah, I'm proud
If that's racist, suck a black dick
I'm the one who going straight to the top
Don't mistake it, it's not that flagrant when you blatantly flop
And plus I stay down, like my date gown in this bitch
I'm about to hit the playground, straight clown, all these kids
I'm watching ladybugs with your lady, I got it made like that
Cleaning house like a maid might rap
I don't play with you lame type cats
Say the same shit for days, motherfucker, if you cold I got flames
You're the ice caps
I bet money y'all don't even know about the ice caps
I don't know that much either

[Hook]
Push the button, lean the couch back, everybody chill
Time to feel better than the free bread at the outback
This so good, chill, put your phone back
Feeling better than the free bread at the outback
Eat that shit, like we supposed to do
Take a rib, get it in, while it's toasted, too
They be like chill, Dicky, chill, I want another
They be like chill, Dicky, chill
You see the butter on that motherfucker?

[Verse 2]
'Bout time someone bringing back that east coast
I got that shit that make a Rabbi be like preach, bro
Cory turned Marshawn, now it's beast mode
I don't buy her sushi, but she still be licking me, so
I'm getting pussy, like I'm Tebow, if he a virgin, I'm a cheese scone
Motherfucker, I ain't no cheese scone, I'm a grown man
I'm just saying that lil David is coming, got Perrier in abundance
I'm with a bitch who pushing fingers down
That's saying she want it
Don't look it's head up on the table, label that seven nothing
I'm faded snacking on Funyuns, while making raps
That's a luncheon
I'm packing a punch and packing lunch and packed in incumbents
Rapping dumber than some tackle football
With no pads to a motherla
That's how you know it's going down
Philly D, so you know I keep that Hoagie around
Philly beef, we don't fuck with that baloney clown
Y'all made a mess, let me just push that old Zamboni around
That's for hockey if you curious
Treat you like my bitches, only peep between the periods
Treat you like my dishes, only need you when I mentioned
To be eating something viscous, y'all deliciously inferior
Dicky sicker than Nigeria
All types of health issues over there, lot of AIDS

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, please, don't fuck with me
I wouldn't like it at all
I'm about to buy a monkey and just chill with him
Like in three years, buy a monkey and just chill with him
Dressing him well as fuck, like, throwing overalls on that monkey
Naming him some shit like Greg, like some normal ass name
Like just Greg and, and like, and like really develop a strong
A strong relationship with the monkey
I assume he become one of my better friends
Professional Rapper coming out this fall, I feel bad for the game
I feel the hope sometimes I just feel bad for the game
They ain't ready, woah, I, I just got a fucking Hinge match
Like throwing that out, y'all, just got a Hinge match, y'all on Hinge?
It's really irresponsible not to be, it's just free pussy[Intro]
Ayy, I'm callin' out all these muthafuckas
Rick Ross, Beanie Sigel, errbody out there that think they grimy
Come see me, yessir

[Verse 1]
Ion fuck around, I been getting down
Not afraid to eat some triscuits up off the ground
5 second rule, I'm on that 5 year
A lotta guys fear what I got in my ears (wax)
If I ain't pissin then you know I'm shittin' bricks
Do it sick, when I finish homie I ain't washin' shit
Shaved dick, shave wit, same shit, face get
Bitches sittin' on my pillows and they butt naked
Lickin' grease off of that pizza
And these muthafuckas probably want a paper towel
Everybody know that I rape toenails
When I pick, then I flick 'em on the straight up ground now
Ain't shit to a muthafuckin' bawlaa
Mo grit than a muthafuckin' dolla
Come back from ballin', you gotta smell sack
Yea its that appalling
And Ion ever wash ma feet
When I'm in the shower, they be hard to reach
When I'm getting down, goin' out on the weekend
I'm asleep before I brush my teeth
I'm a goddamn G tho
Mo grime than Ed Reed's pee hole
Mo grime than Ronaldihno
These other rappers can't deny it

[Hook]
Cuz I don't even act like a thug, but I'm cold enough
I ain't moving crack, holdin' guns
But there's more than one dimension to a bawlaa
You can find ya boy around the way
Being scummy and fucking grubby you know I'm tryna say
That I'm grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch (swag)
Grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch (swag)
It take a slimy muthafucka to be grimy as a grundle
So you in trouble, if you attempt to try to be as gutter as the kid

[Verse 2]
Eating wings, Beating off
Dick stings from the muthufuckin' hot sauce (swagga)
Came nuts...no TP, lazy so I rub it on the damn sheets
Ya man D on that Reggie Evans shit
Boogie pickin', boogie flickin', hella belly button lint
Fuck a bitch, and I'm wetter than a muthafuckin' swish
Yeah I'm sweating more than CC bases loaded, bottom 6
I'm eating mixed nuts with my mouth wide open
At bar a bar where them house flies float
Ion give a fuck if it flush if I must urinate
Not a place up in the house I wouldn't go
I sink piss, and I sniff clothes
Nastier than Kimbo
And I lick snow, When it's yellow
And I sleep at the hotel on
That old blanket that yo mamma used to never let you touch
I just don't give a fuck, I'm nasty like the nut of Johnny Kruk
I do the dutch oven to myself
Fuckin' wit the way it smells
So if someone sicker well then tell me

[Hook]
