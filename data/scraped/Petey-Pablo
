Not my goodies

[Petey Pablo]
I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And it's my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put the car right there
I'm the truth
I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
Cause they seen me do it
Barricades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, it's no use
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back, picking out baskets of fruit
I love you, boo
Yeah Freaky Petey loves you too
You know how I do

[Ciara]
You may look at me and think that
I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby, this is what I'm looking for
Sexy, independent, down-to-spend-it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not being too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

[Hook]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

[Ciara- Verse 2]
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still I'm sexy, independent
I ain't wit' it, so you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it
You think you're slick
Tryn'a hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic
It's just how I gotta have it

[Hook]

[Petey Pablo]
So damn hot, but so young
Still got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shorty
You think you bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest
I been workin' at it since I came to this planet
And I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom bada bam da bam

[Ciara]
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryn'a get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'

[Hook 2x]

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh
Bada boom bada bam da bam[Hook 2X: Petey Pablo]
This one's for North Carolina! C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round yo' hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina! C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-huh, this one's for who?
Us, us, us; yes sir!

[Petey Pablo]
Who am I? Petey Pab' motherfucker!
First to put it down for North Carolina
But guess what (what?), it's been worth it
I'm a superstar, bought me a big ol' car
Four point six (see the car!)
Black with the bars from the front to back
And got a button in the middle, make the trunk go "eh-eh"
But it ain't 'bout that
It's about getting what you getting and driving all back here
Big fellas (six fellas)
Half of me and Carolina niggas done time together
Polk, Bladen, Marshall, Hoke, Greene County, Tillery, damn
Transfer, Sandy Ridge, Browns over here (greens over here)
Pasqoutank, down on the, Odom East (lemme think)
Johnson County, Franklin, Burgaw, Newport, Warren, Shelby, Kenansville
(Man Currituck) Tarboro, Triangle, Goldsboro, Halifax, Statesville
And all my niggas doing life behind the wall
This right here, right here, right here's for

[Hook]

[Petey Pablo]
Uhh, uh-huh, uh-huh, beat it, beat it
You remember them days y'all, we used to play y'all
The radio and put our own lil' part in the song y'all
We used to (Rep our city, rep our city!)
Running through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep-rally jumped off
(hah!) My house, my home, my hood (hah!)
My brother, my sister, my cous' (hah!)
My niggas that was there from the begining
Been wit me even 'fore they knew what bein with me was
Y'all niggas just glanced at it, now I gotcha staring at it
But it's been the
Same ol' North Carolina it's been being
Y'all niggas just getting it, oh it's
A shame isn't it?
Oh you thought we said we were coming wit a whole lotta
Something
We were bullshhh! (ahh!)

[Hook]

[Petey Pablo]
Man I had to do it
Just in case you were one of the ones who wanted to come and ask something stupid
(What you think you doin?) What it look like?
Putting it down for my niggas in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bitty overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothing but a T.T. blast
What we got coming at you? (beats?) slamming, (verses?) classic
(Gold for this) What's after platinum?
(Baby you don't want the bomb) And I don't meant to scare ya
But I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills, these streams and N.C. outta the water
How's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill
And tell 'em - "I told ya!"

[Hook]Yeah!
Baby you have no idea of the things going on in my mind

[Hook]
Let me tell you a couple things about me
So many things I can still tell you about me
So many motherfucking niggas wanna be just like me
And the same motherfuckers I don't like don't like me

[Verse 1]
They got me twisting up my words like I'm sipping on that syrup
My head keeps hurting because I'm constantly worrying about
Shit that ain't even worth it ; Life's too short to be worrying about
Shit you can't control so give it up to the lord
And I've often been to church but I can't stay out of them clubs
And I can't get back to the way I was because foes still talking about Suge
And I need a little more love from the ones who are supposed to love me
And the ones who are supposed to love me have a fucked up way of showing it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sitting on that 5% and low-key and everything I'm in I own it
I roll it and I smoke it ; I might do a little something if I got some
You ain't heard nothing ; You ain't want nothing
All the shit around here had been stepped on
I'm a raw dog, you are home grown; Your shit [?] my rear long
Get back from me before I break your arm
[?] bacteria and clean your palms
I don't know ya'll and I don't owe ya'll a motherfucking thing
Nigga, motherfuck ya'll
Turn around {?] a pastor on me
Yea, hold up bro, do this for me, shock that up, scoop that up
Give me seven more tracks and turn up my vocals for me
Shut your mouth.  Hush your lip.  Wanna be a pimp?  [?]
Suck a dick.  Lick a clit.  Razorblades - cut your wrists
Swollen up, chest big, steroids, you know it is
He said what?  Say it again.  She said what?  Say it again
Who you with?  You with her?  He with you?  You with them?
Oh well!  Aw hell!  Fired up!  Ring the bell!
Light a gun, [?] the shell, and my aim at [?]
One shot to the head, motherfucker, and you know he's dead

[Hook][Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Till y'all been where I been
Till y'all did what I did
Fall back bitch, tell your hating ass homeboy
Fall back bitch, just in case he ain't here to hear it

Till y'all gone where I gone
Till y'all top what I sold
Fall back bitch, move back
Fall back bitch, I hate to have to do that Boy

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
If a nigga got a lot to lose if I hit him
How much I got to lose if I kill him
Might as well go all out if I'm gonna get him
Ain't worth a damn to start and don't ?
Might as well let him feel my ass if I forgive him
Walk around dressing in drag, not living
??? suppose to live that lifestyle their living
I'm merely making my point
(You) feel me
Nervous System, really never knew the fucking definition
Of what the hell is a Nervous System
Mine ain't never been near ??

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Never claimed that I was invincible, not once
Bulletproof I am not, I've been shot
Motherfucker that did it though, guess what
Can't tell a nigga he did it, and guess what
Six feet of dirt keep a motherfucker mouth shut
Tighter than a bodybuilder in a little bitty shirt
(I ain't pull the trigger so)
Telling the Man won't work
(would a did the nigga)
But another nigga got him first
(I wish)
Wouldn't had a did him cause the shit I had for him
He'd a still been here reminiscing about a loved one
Young Blood
Fuck 'round bring out the other motherfucker I want for
Come on

Top light security of the world Carolina
Not just the city, the world Carolina
Need security in the world Carolina

[Hook: Lil' Jon & the Eastside Boyz] + (Petey Pablo in backround)

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Could it be the way that I be repping (why?!), for my niggas
Could it be the way that Petey Petey (ride!), for my niggas
Show a nigga love (love!, raise up motherfucker!!)
You need to be reaching down pulling your god damn shirt up, that's love!
Wherever you live, wherever you from, wherever you call your home
Wherever you lay your God damn Kangol down motherfucker!
Wherever you check your cheese, turn C.R.E.A.M., make that butter
Wherever your ass got lots of fat for all that God damn trunk
Y'all niggas don't understand the seriousness of what Petey be saying

[Hook: Lil' Jon & the Eastside Boyz] + (Petey Pablo in backround)

[Verse 4: Bun B]
From the land of the trill, where the vanity's real
And your man'll be peeled or at least branded, God damn it we ill
More horror than Amityville, no sorrow, hand me the steel
Your tomorrow I can't even feel - ought to be planning your will
UGK ain't dropped in a while, but still we stoping your smile
Keeping boppers in file, standing on top of the pile
And you'll get popped with a smile, this ain't about shopping in style
This about syrup and candy paint, you see us chopping for miles
Out the black and the 'Lac, swingers clap and if they take your flax
You'll get smacked for your packs, paper stacks and you'll crack-back your back
Hold up, they got game to sell you, from drugs to paraphenalia
Guns that'll never fail you, ask Rollie B, he'll tell you

[Verse 5: Eightball]
Memph', Tenn representer (uh), Orange Mile nigga (yeah)
Symbol of the South, legendary rhyme spitter (uh huh)
From Memphis to Mississippi, deep off in the woods (uh)

You tripping if you ain't got 22's on your truck (uh)
Dogs in the yard (yeah), pistol on the seat (uh)
Sticky rolled up for them blunt monkey freaks
My nigga Earl hollered (what's up?) Big Ball got it popping (that's right)
Smoked me a couple, hit the studio and dropped it
For all my dawgs who keep it G and keep it crunk
Represent yo city, let them know where you from

[Hook: Lil' Jon & the Eastside Boyz] + (Petey Pablo in backround)[Sticky Fingaz - talking]
If your head is as big as Shamello's
If your bank is the check cashin place
If you put on panty-hose instead of shavin your legs
If you use grease that you used over and over again
If you only go to church on Easter and holidays
Then you ghetto, believe that

[Hook - Petey Pablo]
Can you be rich and be ghetto? (Yep)
And just cause you poor do that mean that you ghetto? (Nope)
So people don't understand what it mean to be ghetto
And if you gonna ask then you probably never know

[Sticky Fingaz (Petey Pablo)]
Bein ghetto, it's just the things we do sometimes
Like hangin your clothes on the oven to dry
But you late, you gotta go and they ain't ready yet
(You put 'em on anyway, and rock 'em halfway wet)
First you wear then return everything you buy
Always lookin for a discount 'til the day you die
Got three kids, by three different guys
(And all they names begin with La, Ta and Sha)
You know you ghetto when you use a wrench for a channel changer
No antenna, you gotta use a metal hanger
Drink from the container and put it back in the fridge
(Knowin damn well the shit was wrong you did)
Put salt on your food, before you even taste it
Get a doggy bag, ghetto niggas ain't wastin shit
You know you ghetto, no, you know you grimy
(When you iron dirty pants 'til them shits get shiny)

[Hook 2x]

[Sticky Fingaz (Petey Pablo)]
The ghetto's not a place, it don't matter what colour you are
You can be white as chalk or as black as tar
And it really don't matter how much money you have
(You can live on Fifth Ave. and be ghetto fab)
You know you ghetto when your soap is the size of Chiclet
Run into the kitchen wet for dishwashin liquid
The water cold cause they shut off all your power
(You know you ghetto if you pee in the shower)
No toilet paper, somebody used the last you had
No problem, just get a Daily News or a paper bag
Ball it up and crumble it, make it soft in your ass
(But when you flush, the toilet always gets stopped up)
And if you got the money, the landlord never get it
We never pay the rent, yo we almost got evicted
If this shit is funny or offendin you
(Chances are, it's because you're ghetto too)

[Hook 2x]

Can you be rich and be ghetto (3x)
And if you gotta ask then you'll probably never know
Ghetto
East Coast is the ghetto
West Coast is the ghetto
South Side is the ghetto
Everywhere is the ghetto
The ghetto
The ghetto
The ghetto
I'll probably die, in the ghetto..

[Interlude]
(Hey, I got to buy some weed man, you got anything?)
Nah, I ain't selling no weed over there man
(Dude, please I drove all out here for an hour man)
Yo, dog, I not selling no weed over alright man?
Just spent ten years in jail man, back the f**k off me man
You probably a cop (Nah, man I ain't no cop man
I listen to Snoop, I listen  to Wu-Tang, Sticky Fingaz man
I'm down with that s**t) How much you got?
(I got like a hundred bucks on me man)
Give me your f**king money man. Where's your f**king wallet man

You niggas is lucky
???????
??
Motherfuckers hot for the moment
But when the moment's over
And the roller coaster you been coasting on
Comes to a halt and the conductor pull the handle on ya'
You ain't got shit to kick up the paper
What it cost
And he waving his hand for ya', telling y'all to come off
You ain't got no more tickets and everything closed
You look down in my hand and I'm holding the Row
And you know in your soul
I'm a loner, I don't fuck with y'all
Never have, never will
Nigga I don't fuck with y'all
Them ain't my homeboys
I just spit on their tracks
I sent the call for em'
And they ain't call back
I guess they got caught up in what the hood call a big head
Get the nigga that did shit for y'all for no bread
Next time ya' see me out
Ain't a need in acting scared
Just close your mouth and turn your head
Before I predict that I'm a

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
Hop, skip, and a jump
Away from the pen
Been there done that
My niggas miss me in there
If a nigga out here fuck up I'm gonna tear in his ass
This nigga here is short a couple cards in the deck

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I'm so awesome, I perform when I walk
I'm a monster
No ??? I gotta be responsible for
I hit hard and plus I'm armed with firearms
So alert the security, tell em to get prepared for it
Holy moses, jeeper creeper, this nigga throwed off
I done dropped all of my marbles in the floor of my car
Ready to brawl so give me some church hall
And turn up my vocals dog
And let me kick this track in the balls
Put me in this car before you take insurance off it
And I'm gonna drive this bitch until I blow the doors off it
And while you're at it, run in there, smash on em'
Turn over table, kick him in his asshole
Take the paper, grip him up and stick a lighter to him
Stay there and watch all of em' burn
Tired of talking to em'

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
You ain't never did what you say you did
I seen so many different changes in the way you live
But I ain't tripping
You know I keep it straight O.G
And everything you think you done that you think I don't see
I don't fuck with these bustas
I don't fuck with these bustas
Let me explain myself
Let me restrain myself
Let me reflame myself
Nigga, black Chevrolet on all gold D's
Just too motherfucking original ??
It's me, and the army's in a Cutlass Supreme
Dipping through the streets
I got the heater, me and ?
On the way to ?????
I see y'all niggas and you just don't know it
It ain't nothing if you don't live for it, motherfucker
I'm gonna show these niggas by not even responding
Just posted, heater staying open minded
Cause I'm a

Yeah[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
??????  like the airplane pilot is
Like the plane gonna pilot this
(and then party like a rock star) just like them
But I think I rock more like the ladies on a rocking chair
Like all I should rock is damn Roc-A-Wear
Matter fact Jay, send a box of Roc-A-Wear
Let me show em' how to rock-your-wear
Now I would start my own line but I'm out my damn mind
How you gonna cold shoulder, the coldest thing that ever be cold
When I'm cold like the niggas on a polar bear's ??
What I am was a place to live ????
Santa Claus at his house with the AC on

[Hook]
Y'all got me feeling like Britney Spears
Anybody know where Lindsay Lohan is
Let me toot a couple of lines
And take a couple of pills
Get drunk, jump behind the wheel

Y'all got me feeling like Britney Spears
Anybody know where Lindsay Lohan is
Maybe if I fucked up a little bit
Y'all motherfuckers out here
Love me a little more a little bit, Shorty

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Nah, I ain't been laying up in the Cut, getting dusty
I been in the trees having fun with the monkeys
Out in California politicking with them Honkies
Trying to get that motherfucking Will Smith money
I ain't flipped on my folk
To say it, it's atrocious
I been on the boat in the middle of the ocean
With a fishing pole throwed as far as I can throw it
Baby, this time I'm coming home with the groceries
Never have I been more focused
Never have I been more on point and solid like gold is
My bad, most of y'all boys sound ho
Probably don't know what solid gold is

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Man, enough is enough
I'm tired of folk trying me, Brah
What the hell is y'all trying me for
Like I won't come and find you bugs
And do you like some coffee beans and grind you up
And put you in a barber chair, line ya' up
Duct tape, electrical cord
Find your boss man and bind him up
Now what ya' waiting for, you waiting for my time to be up
Man, my time will never be up
Time to shut what we call the fuck up
And the next one to say that, Brah
Go ahead and have speed dial set up, to dial 911 (ambulance sirens)
Yeah, ya' hear that, Brah

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Street runner
Bubble gum chewing little fucker
Stayed in a asshole full of trouble as a youngster
Sold dimes for fifteen, making a big five profit
My thing was in the balled up dolla', now holla
They say absence make the heart grow fonder
It only made me harder
The further I pulled away from my momma
Fuck my father, that dude had a whole lot a problems
And he relieve the stress by whooping on me, with no problem
Thirteenth birthday, stole my brother revolver
Since that day a homeboy little life has been altered
Good lord, my folks was church folks
Stayed at the alter
With my name on pieces of paper for prayer in the box
Will or will not, do me, is all I got
At the bottom of a soda pop, looking at the top
Had the streets hot
Me and Tim, Carolina parking lot
First video I never seen so many shirts up
Now what, time to see them curtains come up
Time the shut these motherfucker's up that's talking so much
Hate me for what
Cause I ain't got your man on my verse
He come from my hometown, but homey what is he worth
Did he put in this work
And pay dues like I did, Sir
So why he still battle rapping in the slums of the earth
Feet in the dirt
Smoking on blunts of the worst
When my folk call down home Georgia dirt
Before somebody get hurt
Please just try to make this here work
I ain't them other folks that come from here and flipped on they verse
I rep for that hurt
Carolina quenches my thirst
If I could pull it off, that's all I would say in my verse
Let me reverse
Send a shout out to my folks at the church
I'm never converting
A trapper but a christian first
I'm a rapper, but that's a gift and a curse
And I don't know which one I love more, dog
The gift or the curse

[Hook] 2x
When the big man turn over my hourglass
And all the sand in my glass pour out
I'll be able to stand straight
And face whatever fate I gotta face with my chest poked out
You can say whatever bout' me
Call me what you wanna call me
Fact will still remain
Can't change

And enjoy the rest of this motherfuckin song
Aight, that was just a fly ass intro to this whole thang
The whole thang[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Till y'all been where I been
Till y'all did what I did
Fall back bitch, tell your hating ass homeboy
Fall back bitch, just in case he ain't here to hear it

Till y'all gone where I gone
Till y'all top what I sold
Fall back bitch, move back
Fall back bitch, I hate to have to do that Boy

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
If a nigga got a lot to lose if I hit him
How much I got to lose if I kill him
Might as well go all out if I'm gonna get him
Ain't worth a damn to start and don't ?
Might as well let him feel my ass if I forgive him
Walk around dressing in drag, not living
??? suppose to live that lifestyle their living
I'm merely making my point
(You) feel me
Nervous System, really never knew the fucking definition
Of what the hell is a Nervous System
Mine ain't never been near ??

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Never claimed that I was invincible, not once
Bulletproof I am not, I've been shot
Motherfucker that did it though, guess what
Can't tell a nigga he did it, and guess what
Six feet of dirt keep a motherfucker mouth shut
Tighter than a bodybuilder in a little bitty shirt
(I ain't pull the trigger so)
Telling the Man won't work
(would a did the nigga)
But another nigga got him first
(I wish)
Wouldn't had a did him cause the shit I had for him
He'd a still been here reminiscing about a loved one
Young Blood
Fuck 'round bring out the other motherfucker I want for
Come on

Top light security of the world Carolina
Not just the city, the world Carolina
Need security in the world Carolina

[Hook]Yeah!
Baby you have no idea of the things going on in my mind

[Hook]
Let me tell you a couple things about me
So many things I can still tell you about me
So many motherfucking niggas wanna be just like me
And the same motherfuckers I don't like don't like me

[Verse 1]
They got me twisting up my words like I'm sipping on that syrup
My head keeps hurting because I'm constantly worrying about
Shit that ain't even worth it ; Life's too short to be worrying about
Shit you can't control so give it up to the lord
And I've often been to church but I can't stay out of them clubs
And I can't get back to the way I was because foes still talking about Suge
And I need a little more love from the ones who are supposed to love me
And the ones who are supposed to love me have a fucked up way of showing it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sitting on that 5% and low-key and everything I'm in I own it
I roll it and I smoke it ; I might do a little something if I got some
You ain't heard nothing ; You ain't want nothing
All the shit around here had been stepped on
I'm a raw dog, you are home grown; Your shit [?] my rear long
Get back from me before I break your arm
[?] bacteria and clean your palms
I don't know ya'll and I don't owe ya'll a motherfucking thing
Nigga, motherfuck ya'll
Turn around {?] a pastor on me
Yea, hold up bro, do this for me, shock that up, scoop that up
Give me seven more tracks and turn up my vocals for me
Shut your mouth.  Hush your lip.  Wanna be a pimp?  [?]
Suck a dick.  Lick a clit.  Razorblades - cut your wrists
Swollen up, chest big, steroids, you know it is
He said what?  Say it again.  She said what?  Say it again
Who you with?  You with her?  He with you?  You with them?
Oh well!  Aw hell!  Fired up!  Ring the bell!
Light a gun, [?] the shell, and my aim at [?]
One shot to the head, motherfucker, and you know he's dead

[Hook][Intro]
You know what it is
Its your boy back in the building
This right here is one of them, one of them
You know what im talkin bout

[Hook]
Down Here we got a different kind of hustle
Grind like a mothafucker, get it from the muscle
Rain sleet and snow ain't but 2 things can touch us
Penitentiary and bein dead as a mothafucka

Down Here we got a different kind of hustle
Grind like a mothafucker, get it from the muscle
Rain sleet and snow ain't but 2 things can touch us
Penitentiary and bein dead a mothafucka

Verse 1 [Petey Pablo]

Man, I'm Carolina, stand on me, straddle the boy
I look hard up at my son and the south at my daughter
Sink into my lemonade is my tar river water
And a half a bag of sugar I ain't even gotta stir it
I parked the car away from curb cause I dont deserve it
You ain't kickin me nowhere youngin im now in my 30s
Want your pant dirty dog I can hadle that for ya
Just a big just a bad thats a ???
Got so much shit on my mind boy its best to keep walkin
Especially if you got a fuck nigger mentality problem
I got a problem solver right here, look like a revolver
Once it start revolving dog there ain't too much there to stop it
Shout at weezy alcwheezy know the path that im on
When he seen me walkin I was by myself in New Orleans
How many miles you think it is for cacilac to New Orleans
So you know this fuckin boy here got some miles on him, don't he

[Hook]x2

Verse 2 [Lil Wayne]

Young Money

9 is expensive and a murder is a bargain
You ain't from the city nigga stay within the margin
Right now Im in the Royce got quad at home chargin
Large and in charge yeah I be that beat
And yeah Bush still wrong like 3 left feet
And yeah the kush still strong and the hoes still work
The toilets stopped up but the stove still work
30-30 lookin like a pole in my shirt
You fuckin with my cake ima turn you to dessert
You give that boy a shovel and you put him to the dirt
Now you are just a baby in the sternum of the earth
Yeah I told Pete it's nothin send a track
Heard it one time, killed it sent it back
Wake up and smell the crack
If you've been through New Orleans, you''ve been through hell and back
Boy

[Hook]

Verse 3 [Rick Ross]

Started at the corner store, then I wanted more
I went and bought a 44, look im ready to roll
I ain't with the nonsense ridin with them convicts
Tryin to get my mom rich see daddy never done shit
Down Here, we eat steaks on the first of the month
We flip work convertible and purposeful blunts
Whip it the the kitchen, call it the hell hole
Im on the cell phone, look another ho 12 gone
Pushin the mercedes benz, its a necessity
Embezzle me, I know the secrets to the recipe
I feed the block, I satisfy their taste buds
Champagne body case all you niggas
Down Here we got a different kind of hustle
Grind like a mothafucka slipin im a touch ya
Ima tell you once bitch, your fuckin with the boss
Show love to my nigga Petey Pete and Rick Ross

[Hook]x2

[END][Hook: Petey Pablo]
Everywhere I go

Every one of my cars, all up to date
You can say what you want
Bitch, I'm straight

Everywhere I go
I'm fresh and I'm clean
I got that man, sitting on my chain
Every one of my cars, all up to date
You can say what you want
Bitch, I'm paid

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
My Mom be begging me
Please Baby
Put up your paper
You never know when them folks might cut 'ya loose from your label
And these houses and car payments ain't able to be paid
And we out on the bus stop stuck in the rain
I ain't gonna say it ain't gonna happen
Cause anything can happen
But I ain't out here just rapping
I'm bout' to be a actor
I'm out here with Sean Penn
And we well connected
The bill collectors can wait a second
(Hey Sean cut the check)
You know your Son's a hustler
I ain't let 'ya down yet
I ain't finna' to start today
You can bet that
Look at all these stones on my neck
I can take out just a chair
And put you in a condo with that
Take the other part of the shit
And clear up your debt
So anything that they took from us
I betcha they gonna bring back
I'm prepared for the bad weather
I ain't a dumb ass
Anything happen
(Hey Suge)
Give my Ma a garbage bag

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I ain't never took them folks to my crib
Showed them folks how I live
If I take em' somewhere
I take em' to the Pen
Show em' how I did it for six years
How I dealt with the bullshit
And how it worked out for the best
How being in there sharpened the skill
Turned the kid into the kid that your hearing right now
And I know you got questions about
Why I'm hanging out
With Suge Knight
And what the hell is this all about
And I'm gonna tell 'ya like this
Real niggas recognize real niggas
That's just how it is
I ain't make it up
That's how it been
Since way back when
You can check for yourself
I ain't bullshitting
I know the situation at hand
Might make folk mad
But goddamn, what 'ya mad at
Cause my house done got a lot bigger
Car's are triple figures
And I ain't gotta fuck with 'ya jealous niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Homeboy, Petey got the streets wondering
The label that I'm labeled on
They wonder
Nervous, shaking like the air condition on
And they ain't got no sweater on
And they colder, than a polar bear's cold
Did they think about it before they signed Usher
Every time I turn around
All up under
American Music Awards
They ain't get no ticket for me
But I still was there
Ticket's, paid cash for em'
Or Suge paid for em'
????
Cause if he paid for em'
We homeboys
I'll get em' back
When I drop three hundred stacks
On this phat, black Phantom (my man)
Throw the keys to em'

[Hook] 2xToday we will be discussing... Love
(I dont think you hear me though)
Is there anyone.. (I don't think you hear me though)
Is there anyone.. (I don't think you, I don't think you)..
Anyone...in love?

[Hook]
I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you
Knowin' the shit you do
I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you
All that shit you took a nigga through
I told myself that everything would work out fine
(I fucked 'round and hit it)
Fucked around and slipped and hit that pussy one mo' time
(I fucked 'round and hit it)
And got caught up in something that's worse than drugs
I'm a motherfuckin' fool for love

And I'm just a (just a) just a (just a)
A motherfuckin' fool for love

[Verse One]
Man, I was sure I had Ms. Perfect
I was settling down
Through fuckin' round
Most the time I stayed at her house
Spent all my time, with her when we stayed in the town
Thought this shit right here was really bout to work out
Quickly found out, that wasn't her intentions
Shorty phone used to ring e're five seconds
Ain't pay attention
She would always take her calls in the kitchen
Go to the sink, runnin' water like she washin' dishes
Ain't tryin' a listen
I know how them shorties is
Always in somebody business
Gossipin', shootin' bullshit with her girlfriend
One day feelin like a joker
Told her I wasn't comin over
Jive got me on the last flight out to Arizona, what I told her
Went over unexpected
Rung the bell (ding dong!) Domino's (just a second!)
Opened the door with the robe on
She only put on, when she naked as the day she was born
I'm just standin' there with crossed arms
Then her baby car came out
Lookin' at me like ("Nigga wha's wrong?!")
Wha's wrong?!?

[Hook]
I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you
Knowin' the shit you do
I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you

Fucked around and slipped and hit that pussy one mo' time

And got caught up in something that's worse than drugs
I'm a motherfuckin' fool for love

And I'm just a (just a) just a (just a)
A motherfuckin' fool for love

[Verse Two]
If I ain't just get outta prison
Man listen, I'd a did him
By Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the nigga, I ain't' bullshittin'
Glad I had my man with me
He fast, turned me around
Pulled me out the house
To the car, nigga we out
I'm madder than a muhfucker, heart tore up
Lookin for a clip to dry this off the side of (whoo!)
Man I caught him in the house wit' my girl
Damn cuz that shit was fucked up
Fuck her,.... just like the rest of 'em
I'm a tell ya somethin', I can't front
We been broke up for a couple of months
And I done called her up we talked
I ain't mad as I was
She ain't doin no mo' than I done
Ya know?, just got caught wit her's
Hit me right here when she told me she still had my stuff
(want me to bring it?) can you stay when you come?
(uh huh) DAMN!

[Hook]
I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you

[Verse Three]
Sheeeit, I ain't a sucker cuz
Shit, I can't help that I love her
My baby got some good stuff
I'm coo-coo for coco puffs
Time to break out the candles
And old Marvin Gaye
Huh, let me straighten up
Aw, you know what?
Hmmm, lemme call her back
Where I put her number at?
Ain't it 757-23..yeah, 36
See if she want some fish
I can fix it 'fore she get here
Man, I hope my boo ain't left yet
Aw, come on, come on
Know you on the other line an' shit

One that's always thinking of new shit
Any place, anytime she wanna do it
Keep her pumping that "get crunk" fluid
Never hesitate, shorty get right to it
I know that it's her when my phone go ring
In three in the morning, it's time to cut
Sometimes she like it soft but not as much as she like it
When a nigga straight beat it up
She don't care where I put it at, long as I put it back
Deep down deep down in that puddy cat
If you ain't never had a freak-a-leak in your life
I suggest you get you one cause ain't nothin' like a

Wanna spit like this cause it is I from the Chi
Wanna get that booty up in the bed, thighs open wide
Every time she speak she tell me her throat go deep
And how she a freak a leak so I kept my eyes on the prize
Shorty work that, twerk that good
Pump back, show me how you cut back good
Suck that, love it how you take that good
Show Lil' Jon and Petey Pab how you shake that stuff
Never be trippin', she cuttin' like it ain't nothin'

Takin' it so superb that it'd a make you sick
Can't even imagine who the fuck that taught her this shit
Everybody wanna know who the hot chick is
I was with in the video in the blue outfit
Like I'm a run and tell a nigga how to find a bitch
I might try and find a how myself, how you love that there
I keep 'em all to self, I don't like to share
Unless they determine that they into that
Being the man I am I'm a let them help their self
And just hope that I live to tell it, I'm good for that
Every now and then it's good to reflect
And think back to all the hot twat that you done hit
Or you done licked, any nigga say that he ain't did it
He a lying ass son of a bitch, hahaha

And I come in anywhere I fucking wanna
There no need to holster em'
My waist band could hold it
Or my Ace could hold it
Or your face could hold it
Police Stations on me
In every state I go in
In every car I roll in
Getting pulled over (pull it over)
I can't help but be a G
That's all that I can be
I can't go to the Army
The Army don't like G's
Or Ex Cons with felonies
And now I got plenty of these behind me
I been in the streets since I was a teen
Doing these crazy things
Getting things with bling
And earrings, gold chains
And everything else I seen on TV

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Knock Knock, who's there
Can't find him anywhere (who you looking for)
Anybody with hair on they chest
Think they can take this test
And at least pass it, with a average, of a B plus
Y'all youngins ain't old enough
To be claiming what you're claiming Bra
You don't run nothing but you're little mouth
And it might be running too much
And too much might be too much
I had enough
Time to shut it down
Sit down and shut up
Learn something
You little itty bitty titty sucker
Just finished sucking something
How titty milk smell spoiled
Little boys and girls, don't be afraid
You can leave me around your boys and girls
I ain't Michael and I ain't robbing
I ain't forgot about em'
Just ain't went to trial
He going don't worry about it
Folk's be talking about it
Just like they talking about Mike

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
(Come on)
I ain't dissing nobody
I ain't gotta diss nobody
Ain't nobody gonna do nothing to nobody
Y'all can come in
And I can show ya' how to get the party started
Fuck a bottle, buy the Bar
Tell the man to ? the car
Tell that girl right there come here
So I can whisper in her ear
And tell her something that she need to hear
You know what it is
I'm back in here again
I can do it again
Tell the DJ put the needle on the record

[Hook][Intro: Lil Wayne]
Uh-oh, uh-oh
You know how we do it
Weezy and Petey, baby

Holla at 'em dogg

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Cuz I know I ain't dreaming

What's the name of y'all jeweler tell 'em freeze me up
Hating me kinky licks talking so much
Lemme give these sons of bitches a reason to keep it talking

They leaving you something crop stolen
An asshole heard it
Hip on purpose
Dre I did what you told me

Keep me a burner
Poison that I grab in the morning

A real nigga trill nigga pull out and get debated

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Petey Pablo]
They call me Young Ass Weezy
I'm gon' round up the whole uptown
We gon burn this bitch down to the ground

Crazy-ass Petey

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

Old cats wants to test come see shortie

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
You see it's Young Wayne
Game is ashamed and they say he's a pain
He is crazy deranged
Put them blades on his thing
Just like 80 to summer
So, when the sun hit it look like Baby or something
So, when I come through the ladies praise me or something
Like, Weezy's the man
If you be's where he be's then you leaves with a tan
Cuz he's 500 Degreez
I need a fan, whew
Cool me off wipe me down
Daddy is back in town
With the back of my Caddy slanted down
And the MAC goes black if you ask around
Put some hash in that grass that you pass around
Then I stash a pound by my ave with rounds
I'm a gangsta until they put my casket down
You can ask around
And they tell you like me
There ain't nobody like me
It's Weezy Baby

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Ayo see this right here is Young Weezy, nigga

[Verse 1 - Petey Pablo]
One of the illest rhymers that ever came outta Carolina, put this whole shit
On the map
Went back got two states, y'all crammed way to the back
And brought 'em up to the where the rest of 'em at (cause I can do that)
Granddaddy was real strong, daddy was in the Army
I was a bad motherfucker, slightly retarded
Mentally institutionalized, since the age of 5
Buildin tree houses (that the wind couldn't blow down)
Look at me now, holdin it down
Doin it well, I ain't triple platinum yet (but ain't gon' worry 'bout it)
I'm wearin the good damn crown, man I'm the president
And reppin both states (back here in Carolina)
Where the hell did you find 'em? (boy is an animal)
His flow is incredible, style is bananas
I just wanna go to the Grammy's and I don't care if I win
Just to say I've been god dammit (god dammit)

[Hook - Petey Pablo] - 2X

And that way you can ride wit a ... (y'all ready)

Get on dis motorcycle
Get on dis motorcycle
And get your hips on in the big ass truck (y'all ready)

(*motorcycle engine*)

[Verse 2 - Petey Pablo]
From the world of dirt roads, them big ass pot holes
The land of old homes, the land of screen screen doors
Car in the back yard, dog chain tied up
Ain't drove it in years, sittin on nothin
Spit crunk mosquito buckets, hot wood heaters
Hooked up Honda Accord, with house speakers
Bag, phone and beeper, corduroys and sneakers
Pit Spike Lee's and them shell toe Adidas
You don't know shit 'bout Petey (Petey)
Real definition of the greasy, grimy and gritty
You itty bitty bitches sellin drugs for another nigga
Always lookin at me like your trigger finger itchin
I give ya my best witness, when you come to handle your business
You better be ready to get it, cause I don't be bullshittin
I'm up into plastic bottles cause if I keep on feelin the way I'm feelin
I'mma blow up in this motherfucker

[Hook] - 2X - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Twenty-seven dollars to my name, headed up
85 pissy drunk, Petey still made me drive
Left off from LaGrange, passin through Squattenburg
On the way to High Point and my speech startin to slur
Better tell these sons of bitches, boy to move won't allow for me
To stop and say I'm sorry to this dude and this scout
It was just a little bump, shit you dented my Ferrari
Don't call the law, shit is rented, look I'm sorry
All we have done in the name of the south
Gave these ugly motherfuckers somethin to "Raise Up" about
But I'm still unfulfilled, since my daddy still drivin
That fuckin school bus, know that Bubba still strivin
I want me a label, want me a mansion
Timmy can't give it to me, Jimmy ain't spit it to me
Rest assure though, the day is approachin
When these old country boys ain't just playin, they coachin

[Petey Pablo - talking]
Get on dis motorcycle ..
Y'all ready, get on dis motorcycle
(*motorcycle engine*), y'all ready
Get on dis motorcycle ..
Y'all ready

HEYYY!

[Hook] - 2X

(*Female voices humming and motorycle engine continues until end*)My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies

[Petey Pablo]
I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And it's my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put the car right there
I'm the truth
I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
Cause they seen me do it
Barricades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, it's no use
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back, picking out baskets of fruit
I love you, boo
Yeah Freaky Petey loves you too
You know how I do

[Ciara]
You may look at me and think that
I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby, this is what I'm looking for
Sexy, independent, down-to-spend-it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not being too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

[Hook]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

[Ciara- Verse 2]
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still I'm sexy, independent
I ain't wit' it, so you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it
You think you're slick
Tryn'a hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic
It's just how I gotta have it

[Hook]

[Petey Pablo]
So damn hot, but so young
Still got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shorty
You think you bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest
I been workin' at it since I came to this planet
And I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom bada bam da bam

[Ciara]
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryn'a get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'

[Hook 2x]

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh
Bada boom bada bam da bam[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Bag a weed, bag a coke
Bag a crack, bag a dope
Little nigga in the streets of Baltimore
Living like fuck tomorrow
Riding round in a brand new car, what I need a license for
People only need license when they get stopped by the law
And I ain't getting stopped by the law
Nigga I'm on a trip like fuck the law
Better beat me to the draw
I'm on, give the popo what the popo give my folks
What I think the motherfucker asked for
Leave me alone
Or motherfuckin' chase this car
Cause I ain't pulling over nothing, motherfucker
I ain't got no license and I gotta gun in da car

[Petey Pablo talking]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I went to the pin
I had to do a bid
Fourteen with a seven man
Y'all really don't understand
Back then I'm a little bitty man
But I gotta will to live
And I gotta motherfuckin' heart that's as big as a goddamn car head
Shook up a little, but I was never scared
Motherfucker I don't fear not na'
Man, women, or child
Dude I'm a live wire
When you get a chance, touch a live wire
You'll see what I'm talking about
But not just any wire
Climb up on top a the house
Stay grounded and grab that wire
Blow the bottom of your motherfucking boots out
All you gonna hear is a POW!
And your neighbor yelling, MAN DOWN!

[Petey Pablo talking]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Nigga's call me cold, heartless, ruthless, outta control
But you know what, man fuck them hoes
They like motherfucking deers in the road
And if I hit em' I'm gonna tear the whole front of the truck off
And he gonna call the law
And then I'm back in the system again
And he gonna get paid, get up and hit wind

[Petey Pablo talking]

Cause I ain't got no license and I gotta gun in da car
(And I gotta gun in da car)4x[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Ya' know
When you can't talk about selling dope no more
Twenty-two's, Twenty-four's don't fit no more
And they realize, rocks ain't nothing but stones
Ten percent diamond, ninety Cubic Zirconia
The houses you televise, ain't your home
Cause to own it, you got to pay mortgage on it
When it's all over
Most of y'all ain't gonna have nothing to show
For what ya' had, cause ya' lost it all
Running round trying to play big dog
Keeping up with the Joneses
Dude, your paper ain't that long
Motherfuckers wanna hear a good song
Not how many cars ya' got parked in them White Folk's yard
That's why I can cut off, to cut back on
Jump slam off the same dude

Hey Dre

[Outro][Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
First let me apologize to Jeezy
For jumping on a Jeezy track and I ain't talk to Jeezy
But my intentions were good
I'd a called dude number but ain't have it to do it
Dog, the track was so hood
The first time I heard it, knew I had to do it
And if I won't intend to do what I'm gonna do to it
Swear to God I never wouldn't a did nothing to it
Everybody looking for him, where the hell is Petey at
Petey on the griz-ind, same place I been at
North Carolina is where I live at
When I go out to Cali it's to visit
And even if I did leave, say I did that
It'll never change the color of the blood I bleed
Or for what I bleed for
Or for what I open up my eyes every morning, take a breath and breathe for
Martin Luther Petey, Carolina leader
Got the soul of a lion and the speed of a cheetah
Busy as a beaver, wing span of a eagle
Nigga sitting high like I smoked me some reefer
Peek-a-boo see ya', wouldn't wanna be ya'
Still my turn baby boy, take it easy
Free the Petey, I got my feet back in the stiz-urp
Back up out the diz-irt
Sip-sipping on siz-urp

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
I'm a legend
Wassup, wassup
Uh huh, uh huh
Say what, say what
Hold up, wait a minute
I ain't trying to hear that shit
I ain't trying to hear that shit

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Fresh and ain't nothing fresher
I ain't fronting like I'm better
But, till they find something better
I'll forever be the glue that hold it all together
I love em' all, like I wrote em' all a love letter
Carolina, what'd I tell em'
Didn't I tell em'
Hell yeah, through all kind of weather
We gonna weather the storm together
I'm gonna hold em' down, whether they right or they wrong
Whether they short or they long
What they let us put together, let no man put us under
Through the rain, sleet, snow
Through the lightning and thunder
We gonna keep on bumping through, like we in some bumper cars
Nigga's swagger swinging like, children on the monkey bars
Man I'm in a swagger suit, sitting in a swagger car
I got so much swagger wit' this, I swear I need to knock it off
Nigga told me, it costs to be the boss
So I opened up the vault, and paid him what it cost

[Hook] 2x


[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
If you believe in me, you'll have eternal life
I ain't God, nah
But I'm God like
Come into the light, make all this wrong right
Quit all this back and forth
Man, I don't wanna fight
I'm enjoying life, I could a died twice
I got a second chance, I'm trying to get it right
Meet a pretty girl, make her my pretty wife
And have some pretty kids by her, aight
I'm a legend[Hook: Petey Pablo]
I make moves
I make moves
I make moves
I make moves

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Started in the streets
Came from the Gutter
Little drug dealer making plenty of money
Started selling dime's
Then I moved up
Started pushing twenty's cause ten's just wasn't enough
Dabbled that a few years
Had a lot a fun
Switched up the game
Left the petty shit alone
Time to get this major paper that I really want
Took off my ?
Put on a suit and let's roll
Time to get it cracking somewhere I ain't known
Ninety-five North, maybe Baltimore
Got a bid
Did a 1985, 86, Michael Jackson back slid in the same shit again
Cause the city was a lot bigger
Made me a lot richer
Then I got "locked up"
And went to prison
Stayed in there a few years
And made my decision
When I get out I'm on a mission

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Music was my first high
Sung in the Church Choir
Before I could even speak, I learned how to harmonize
Watching the other guys
With passion in my eyes
Wondering how mine gonna sound
When mine come out
Then I opened my mouth, something spilled out
Then I looked around, I done drew a crowd
Everybody bobbing they head, baby I'm throwing down
Oh yeah, it's on now
The way I'm going now
No looking back for me I got up out my Ma's house
And a few cars just in case we wanna ball out
Cruise around the world till the gas run out
Hit the station automatic window never rolled down
We don't pump gas no more
Tell them to come out
Take this hundred dollar, fill it up if you don't mind
Right back on the road hitting cruise control
Heading right back to wherever I was going

[Hook] 2x(Chorus)
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

(Verse 1)
I' told you from childhood nigga I will always be wit ya
Through hell or hot water it'll be me and you nigga
This can go down in the test of time
Whether Ripley believe it or not, make it happen once in a lifetime
Kinda hard to find, two niggas that growed up on two different sides of town
That get down like I get down, and done his like I done mine
Hit it off first time around, been solid as the foundation under the house
This some, shit for us to brag about (bout it bout it)
We answered the question and never had to take the time to think out
That's why I'll ride for my nigga, cry for my nigga
Die for my nigga
Hold ya one hand in the sky for ya nigga
Tell them you gone always remember

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
You know you one of the reasons I'm still breathin cause without you I don't know where in the hell I would be
(homeboy)
You know life's been hard at home (homeboy)
That's what made us turn to the streets (homeboy)
I think that's what had us claimin thugs, sellin drugs
Duckin from the fuckin police, indulgin in
Booze and women, foolish niggas
Young, dumb, and off the leash
Outta control, but I wouldn't change it
If I could I would do it the same (if I can do it)
But if it wasn't for the game, teachin us game
We prolly would be stuck with the lames (but DAWG)
Somehow we made it, and I'm glad that I can tell ya today
That my nigga gone always be my nigga
Cuz that's the way it's ‘pose to be

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Sometimes I wanna play some ball, Sometimes I wanna walk through the mall
(Sometimes I Wanna play some ball, and just walk through the mall)
Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just wanna spend some time alone
(Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just wanna spend some time alone wit my niggas)
Sometimes I wanna hop in the car, and drive till tomorrow
(Sometimes I wanna hop in the car, and just drive till tomorrow)
Sometimes I wanna pick the phone, just to see what's goin on
(Sometimes I gotta pick up the phone, just to see what's goin on wit my niggas)

(Chorus 2x's)
