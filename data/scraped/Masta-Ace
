[Intro: Brother Ali]
Said they just don't make 'em like this no more
In fact they never made 'em like this before
I'm 'bout the baddest man that ya eyes done saw
Baby, I'm down by law

[Hook]
Dangerous

[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
Life gave me nothing free, but my ugly
Ass mug and a couple of fat nuts to squeeze
Dick dangling down in my dungarees
Hungry beast, I'll chase your ass up a tree
You know what's up with me, I'm sucker-free
Not uptown or uppity, it's not my cup of tea
Feared one in the streets, won't nothing bleed
Except my knuckle meat, caught up in your fucking teeth
Brother, please, I'm out here rhyming for survival
Plus I got a outta-body-mind-blowing live show
Squad of fine dimes follow me wherever I go
Got them on their knees trying to honor my arrival
Quick Draw McGraw, this mic of mine, I'm a prime time pridaw
Down by lidaw, broke dick, big dog
Who the hell am I? The A, the L, the I, and I’m the God damn shit, y'all

[Hook]
Dangerous
You should see me swing the jimmy

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Don't get me started
I'm golden era, '88 baby highly regarded
I get stupid, dookie, doo-doo, def, dumb, retarded
Watch you fade like a high top when I drop
Leave you flattened like a pancake at IHOP
With a pistol I'm a nice shot
Many battles are losable, losing isn't unusual
Life is brutal, but beautiful, birth allude to a funeral
I'm straight raw, cocaine natural
You that flesh-eating veterinarian drug used to de-worm cattle
The same way Big flipped mics I'mma show you how I run things
I'm the Don: Corleone, Cornelius, Trump, King
Is the world yours or mine? I'm an immortal in his prime
Structure doesn't follow the corporate design
I'm snapping your porcelain spine
To deep for the mortal mind every time I'm recording a rhyme
They find that I'm crossing the line
If you're blind and ignoring the grind
It’s sickening, ain’t a chick alive I won’t stick my dick in
I'm more shameless than Hammer dancing for popcorn chicken
Ace was the ink before Irv Gotti was laundering loot
And he dropped Slaughtahouse before they was ever forming a group
Fuck being miserable, whether it's the mental or in the flesh physical
Blessed are the poor in spirit
Yeah, I took it Biblical, I'm so dangerous

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
When this mic's in my hand I'm a cannibal man
Eat my own kind, damn, I'm an animal, fam
And if you a grown man then stand if you can
On your own two feet with a tangible plan
Now my plan's ripping them all, never fall
And achieve all goals like I'm kicking a ball
Like taking out your dick in the mall
Want everyone to see that it's me and I'm sicker than y'all
And this track's like a brick in the jaw, a bat to the head
Go ahead, get back in the bed
Keep sleeping, I'll be the nightmare of your dreams
Spit right, the flow's tight like a pair of your jeans
Take those off, y'all dudes feminine style, so foul
Meanwhile, men, women, and child praise me, the epitome of the best
Deadly like three in the chest, dangerous

[Hook][Intro: Announcer from Soul Calibur]
Welcome back, to the stage of history

(Yo.. Slim Shady!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll.. I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet, 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end but every time I take a step
It gets dim, tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Verse 2: J-Black]
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'mma drink till my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, fuck the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'mma be so high
That I'mma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

[Hook]

[Interlude: Announcer]
Maxi was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care

[Hook]

[Outro: Announcer]
Time's up!
You lose![Hook]
Pay homage, respect
Yeah, one-two
Acknowledge the rep
I don't know what you cats was thinking
Pay homage, respect
Musta been crazy
Acknowledge the rep
To step up on stage, at CMJ, mention my name

[Verse 1]
I hear these cats, but I ain't listening
A little faint dissing, a little scratch, a little paint missing
But I still gleam and glisten, hot like a stream of pissing
I'm about to have your whole team wishing
That you never got this shit started
You about to be dearly departed
You gotta be nearly retarded
To let me hear my name mentioned, tryna gain attention
Now I'm running through this game lynching
And I heard a few cats tryna take shots on the low
These XFL rappers tryna fuck with a real pro
One thing; who named y'all the High and the Mighty
To me, y'all just sound like a couple of high whities
You had to be on mad coke and ecstasy
To think for a second, you can stand next to me
Look don't ever again mention my name in your freestyles
Or I'll cut off your transmission faster than Lee Myles
And I heard your album, this must be something you're new at
Cause I'd rather hear a Lil' Wayne/Lil' Zane duet
My cellphone stay ringing like a slap in the ear
So I hope y'all don't plan on making rap a career
Cause ever since Heav' was in Vernon I been burning
Next year, y'all be up in Rawkus, interning
And I shoulda let it known what your government names are
To make sure you Take It Personal like Gang Starr, motherfuckers

[Hook]
I got one lyric, pointed at your head for start
Another one, is pointed at your weak ass heart
And that go for any other so called rap cats, in the game
Pay homage, respect
Acknowledge the rep
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
And believe me, I ain't forget about him, naw
Pay homage, respect
Nope, acknowledge the rep
Just you wait
Acknowledge the rep

[Verse 2]
Yeah I heard of the Boogiemann when I was a youth, scary
And I found out that he was as fake as a tooth-fairy
Since my last mission this nigga's been ass-kissing
I took a minute, I gave your single a fast listen
Tell me this, with no pot to piss in, how you dissing
Your group homes are about to be reporting you missing
And I don't know what was worse, the track or the verse
I'mma get to your producer, but I'm smacking you first
See I couldn't even find one nigga that heard of you
I did find a few cats that wanted to murder you
But I told 'em chill, I let 'em know you was my son
And I promise I can pay support til' you twenty-one
Consider me the clothes on your back and a warm meal
Who knows, this might just get you a deal
And the day that your album go on sale for the first hour
Just remember like Nas nigga, I Gave You Power
I figured I give ya some help, cause you need lots
I make your producer change his name to Speed Nottz
Tell him I say fuck him for doing the tracks
Matter of fact, fuck Fat Beats, for doing the wax
I'mma diss you via e-mail and then through a fax
I'mma diss you by two-way, I ain't gon' never relax
I'mma diss you over fast, slow track or no track
If your shit wasn't so whack, I dissed you to your track
You that little fish that I catch and I throw back
And by the way, give 50 Cent his flow back
You that cat in the club that get hit with a bottle
Fucking with me, you better off trying to hit lotto
And don't answer back, this is hard shit to follow
And you can't spit nigga, so you obviously must swallow
Motherfucker[Masta Ace]
Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off then, I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can lift your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital "A" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like Crusoe
Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (Yo, I believe that's me)
Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Craig G]
This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, cuz now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on the tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew
You said, "Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo Craig, I heard you in that jam, and it's pumpin'!
I apologize. Oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?"
That's how I'm livin': on surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, cuz on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up...(Yo, I believe that's me)
Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Kool G. Rap]
Yo, Marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
That make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and wanna sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's death
Makin' veterans run for medicine
Cuz I put out more lights in a fight than Con Edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
So if you want rage, I'mma make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, todays the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though. Solo. Cuz you're still all...soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than Brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me
Bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Serve the sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, G Rap wrecks, he's rated X, that means the boy is sex. Next
The amplifier gets used and abused. Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang a
Rapper or singer: I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up... (I believe that's me)
Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony

[Big Daddy Kane]
Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord;
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear -- then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
Cause rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution. I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kicked it
Cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, cause Daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to your health
So put a quarter in your ass, cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that Allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
Cause when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, emcees, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge. Don't barge, cause goddamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant. You're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin'. So put Kane in, that category. Period. End of story[Verse 1]
Brainiac, dumb-dumb, bust the scientifical
Approach to the course and the force is centrifugal
Can you find ya way through the lyrics that be catching em
Throw another rhyme across the room they be fetching em
And they take a loss, take a loss to the Master and I
Throws crazy blows and they knows I be plastering
All across the room on the ceilings and the walls too
Punk little suckers didn't know I had the gall to
Come around they block with my cocked-diesel system and
Turn it up to 10 and then start to diss them and
They didn't wanna battle if they did when they saw me
They'd a opened up they trunk but they try to ignore me
Hey little suckers I know you hear me callin you
Thought you wanted some but I see that you all into
Frontin ain't no future in your frontin so let's get it on
Like Marvin Gaye,(hey) take the cash and sit it on
The hood of ya wick-wack low-ridin Cadillac
Back up ya boys and let's start the battle
Act like, ya know, the Masta Ace don't play when it come to my bass, aahhhh

[Hook]
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll (repeat several)

[Verse 2]
Drivin down the block like what else should a brother do
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might smother you
Rolling down my windows yeah I have a air-conditioner
But I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to
Waitin at a red light, Kentucky Fried Chicken in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking in
See this Puerto Rican Latin Chico Rico Suave
In a red Corolla eh yo does he wanna play
Pullin up beside me, looking like he want it
Show me what you got then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we can't hear they horns
Cause he music a grande yeah he got it goin on
But I think I better school him cause he don't know the time
So I'm turnin up the boom cause he cannot mess with mine
Brothers hear me hitting from like 50 blocks away I
Wanna turn they heads so you know I gotta play
High decibels passing through a residential district
See a few cuties and I turn it up like Bisquick
Mira, mira man don't sleep, I got tha, I got tha, I got the woofers in my Jeep

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Black boy, black boy turn that shit down
You know that America don't wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum jungle music go back to Africa
Nigga I'll arrest you if you holding up trafffic
I'll be damned if I listen, so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
I'm breaking ear drums while I'm breaking the law
I'm disturbing all the peace cause Sister Souljah said war
So catch me if ya can, if you can here's a donut
Cause once you drive away, yo I'm gonna go nuts
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya can't stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it, they probably start dancing
Jumpin on my tip and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis
Strictly the hardcore dirty street level hits
God's on my side so watch what the devil gets
Positivity hitting 50 levels deep
Coming out, they coming out the woofers in my Jeep

[Hook][Hook]
Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn
Never taking shorts cause Brooklyn's the borough

[Verse 1: Special Ed]
Panic, as another manic depressant
Adolescent stares at death, now what's left
When there ain't no guide, and a whole lot of pride
It might be a homicide, so let the drama slide
We don't want no problems, B
Get your name in the obituary column sheet
Cause life is too short and it just gets shorter
I wish I had a quarter for all my people they slaughter
Last year alone, in the dead zone
Walk straight but don't walk late
Cause I'm coming with a hate only made from what it made me
Cause nobody ever played me
Now it's only getting worse
Buckshot and Ace in the land of the waste
Kicking you in your face

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
We be doing it up Crooklyn style
What does it take to get you wild
My mentality is getting iller, killer
Instinct that's trying to infiltrate, but wait
I know you wanna enter but I can't let you in
My mind state's the maddest, I'm gone with the wind
Because it is survival of the fittest
When the shit hits the fan I got my shank in my hand
Black man with the permanent tan
I come from the 'ville and never ran, damn!

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
I'm feeling another part of reality
Hit me when I represent the F.A.P
Straight from the 'ville, Tilden played the building
I mean literally when I say I make a killing
For my cipher, see I'm finning to bust a piper
Original heads represent the Brooklyn all-nighter
Do or die I'm saying it's you and I
Bring your click so we can get stone like Family Sly
Peace to C.I. and the Bush
Mighty Mateen, Ruck and the Rock giving the push

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Masta Ace]
We did it like that and now we do it like this
We did it like that and now we do it like this
Go inside your mind and find a time that you miss
And just think about the steel in your fist
It's just an extension of your arm, it's that ghetto type of charm
That makes all the homeboys swarm
Can I drop the bomb, oh yes I can
Move with the groove, smooth like Geechie Dan
Who is the man, that kid there
Who is the chick with the pick in her hair
Angela, uhh, Davis and we roll like Avis
Rent-a-Car kid, there you are

[Verse 5: Special Ed]
You know where to find me whenever you need me
If you know the Ave, follow the path
To the land of the aftermath but don't frolic in the midst
Crazy ass Crooklyn kids
Cause they always throwing a body on my lawn
I'm getting a Rottweiler without a collar
Get off my block, boy and give me a dollar
For the trouble, or get blown up like a bubble

[Verse 6: Buckshot]
Let's take a sec to think back
To the year of the 7-0 when Brooklyn was the place to go
Flow on a journey up to Crown Heights
Ebbets Field, feel the reel to reel on your life
Trife individuals live in the PJ's
Dee Evil, check my DJ, hey
Play what I wanna play in the day
But in the night, I feel the right took the left
Bucktown, Brooklyn, break it down
Heads from state to state, travel as I unravel the rate
Howard, Tapscott & Sutter
I remember way back in the days playing hot peas and butter
Brother, if you want another lesson, Crooklyn session
Take it back, black Smith and Wesson

[Verse 7: Special Ed]
Press your luck, you get stuck by Buck for your bucks
Masta Ace has the taste for ducks
And duck sauce so tell Lord Digga
Dig a grave for the bones, sticks and stones
While I kick some ancient poems through your domes
Act went back to attack your homes
So, Tip, can I flip? (Yes, you can)
I'm in the World War with Muhammad, my man

[Verse 8: Masta Ace]
Feels so good to be a Crooklyn Dodger
Uh-huh, what's happening to ReRun and Roger
I think I seen 'em wearing Timberlands and running down the block
From Dwayne and Dwayne had a Glock
Cause he be selling rock for the Partridge Family
And Reuben Kincaid drives a 300-E
And he be pimping Chrissy From Three's Company
Plus he stuck Mr. T for all his jewelry
This is a 70's thing from the days
When kids didn't act so crazed in Crooklyn

[Hook x2][Intro]
Yeah, BK, Uptown, Boogie Down, Queens
It's beautiful

[Verse 1]
Listen, I got a lot to say
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today, I have to laugh on the real
The aftermath's kind of ill like I'm Dr. Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
This game make you get jaded, I just hate it (just hate it)
But this song gives a different kind of feeling
It's a new kind of dealing, it's a special kind of healing (uh huh)
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz? You know what it is
Positive over negative, see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster (that's right)
I rise up above
See, people still showing me love
Got the respect without dropping a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new hit, you can pop in the deck
It's beautiful

[Hook]
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is brand new Uptowns still in the box
This is the Yankees, 10-nothing, killing the Sox
This ain't hugging the block with a gat in your hand
This is Boca Raton on a catamaran (that's right)
With the sun beaming down where you at in the sand
I feel like I'm more than a cat with a plan
This feels like it's more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in your hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
That's why I stole this mic, y'all don't hold this right (nope)
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack, no a glass of Henny (that's right)
Now drink it up 'til there ain't nothing left in it
I'm repping it, BK, that's a definite
Just more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(I'm wishing on a, on a, on...) the most beautifullest thing ever
And it's here to bring terror to the bling era (yeah)
You can feel it in your inner
It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving dinner
It's like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark (swish)
It's that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat gon' use it
I see a black man aiming his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claiming his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down with Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it cause it brought us here
It's a young mother braiding her daughter's hair
It's beautiful

[Hook][Cuts - DJ Ray D:]
"Let' start the battle"
"I got the type of skills that make you wanna quit"
"We got that raw shit"
"Tajai"
"Gib mir das Mic"
"King S"
"Masta Ace"

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Yeah it's dark down here, when it spark down here
You just might get attacked by a shark down here
See we smart down here, we do it for the art down here
Make sure your shit is sharp down here
Cause this ain't no stroll in the park when you walk down here
No, everybody's starving down here
Most can't survive, cause there's war down here
Extreme self-esteem getting torn down here
Life's full of drama but it's more down here
End up in a pool of blood on the floor down here
Everything you witnessed and you saw down here
Leaves you permanently scarred to the core down here
Above ground great but it's raw down here
Your ass better abide by the law down here
Cause one false step and you can fall down here
Best rappers in the world and we all down here

[Cuts]

[Part 2: Savas]
Brainiac dumb dumbs, was für ‘ne Entwicklung, Opfata
Jetzt ist der Prof. am Start, ihr schreibt mal euer Magister
Entschlüsselt erst diese Hieroglyphen, Essah ist das Synonym für
„Kein Respekt“, diese MCs sind nur Parasiten wie Chlamydien
Werd‘ nicht müde, sie zu rügen, sprecht es offen aus hier
Die Karrieren sind wie Nebel im Allgäu – Fischen im Trüben
Warten aufn Hit, ich weiß, die Wahrheit schmerzt, werd‘ wütend
Was für „Star“? Komm mir zu nah, ich lass dich gern verglühen
Ich geb‘ ihn‘ Kügelchen wie ‘n Naturheiler aus der BB-Gun
Es reicht – Pump, aber ich bin dir mit dem Kopf voraus wie Zidane
Sieh ihn an, eins 80 und doch ein Riese
Sie fragen mich, was mit Beef ist
Geh, check Bello 3, reagier auf sie wie ’ne Wand
Schön für dich, du machst deine Mucke zu Kohle, ich zum Diamant
Setze mich gegen den Teufel zu wehr
Und siege – Nenn mich Vietnam
Außen cool, aber innerlich führt es dich wie den Adler, immer
Back zu dei’m Horst, Dicka, („That’s when ya lost”), Ficker

[Cuts]

[Verse 3: Tajai]
I got ears for the talent, hands for the hustle
Mind on militant, heart full of struggle
Watch the footwork you just might get hurt
Either you're with me or against me on life's adventures
So approach cautious, I'm known to stomp imposters
Unconscious, in a fresh pair of Adi Dasslers
Formatted lossless, acts of lawlessness
In suit when I drop this instant mosh pit
I did it to death from the dingiest depths where the apes at
In a skate straight to the apex
Scraped and scratched, still lamp with a great set
[?] wax strapped in a camp where the grapes at
Cut the hand of any scamp tryin' to take that
Straight blaw, most you could do is imitate that
Brrat, rappers on their blat, riders on the set
Everybody walk, ready set, uh

[Cuts]Its the ill scripts
And the Hieroglyphics
Plus the scientifics...for the mind x2

Verse 1: Masta Ace?
Hey yo, hey yo
Open up your eyes and tell me what you see
Ease on down the road with me
I hold the key to the doors of your brain
And mental pain was showered down like the rain
From the sky, I wondered, "why did I fly
To a land that was covered by sand?"
And when you popped the shoes off my feet
I walked through blistering heat and didn't eat
For forty days until I came to a door
At the bottom of a mountain by the shore
My word is bond
I walked in with no fear
And I could hear a fat track in the rear
So I slid to the source of the sound
And what I found, was mad tapes all around
And Kangol hats and suede pumas by the pair
Then in walks this tall man with waves in his hair
He didn't speak
He walked over to his chair took a seat
And then that stopped the beat
"What's goin' on?" I say
Wonderin' and wonderin', "should I stay?"
With no delay he picked up his crooked click
And the thick book he reached out to me and I took it quick
That's what he told me to do
I took it home and then I read it with my crew
Okay I think that it's time we begin
A(of) dreamin' we'll benefit from the chapters found within

Its the ill scripts
And the Hieroglyphics
Plus the scientifics...for the mind x3

Verse 2: UG (of Cella Dwellas
Chapter 1
I rip out your spine and play the piccolo with your vertebrae
I bet this hurted way different tunes I play
Tunes they open, I'm hopin', keep the rises
My eyes is irritated with livid pictures
Reality fades away
I hear chinks are like the town chariot to all the gangs
Even grapes my dagger's ready for war sharpening edges
For incisions limit decisions
Like bendin' prisms color form watch the rainbows
Terrific and has mad flavors like skittles
Slide into a pot of gold as I unfold a thought
'I kill human beings for sport'

[Verse 3: Lord Digga of Masta Ace Incorporated]
Chapter 2
I flex skills that are nasty like porn
Bound to getcha' fucked up as they get ripped, torn
Out the frame bringin' pain to ya membrane
And drain ya veins 'til no blood remains
Mystic brain thoughts like a gypsy
Sippin' on cognac, feelin' kinda tipsy
It's the mic destroya
Jack's bean stalk got jacked by Goya
Oh boy ya here we go again
In the Philippines they be eatin' man's best friend
Gimme 5 to 10 county jail or state pen
But the styles I be killin' off and on like trends

Its the ill scripts
And the Hieroglyphics
Plus the scientifics...for the mind x3

[Verse 4: Phantasm of Cella Dwellas]

Chapter 3
Hocusin' Pocusin'
I use my third eye to focus in
On your crucifixion an' a psychic like Jeane Dixon pop-predictionin'
Niggas better flee cuz its realm three
I have a different personality
So run go tell your friends, its the dwella from the cella
An pop a cap of swellegant and you'll be free
Mr. ????? (lady voice)
Like Andy Panda I'm from the luster land
The Necromancer, the Indian Rain Dancer
Underground its the killer clown
The dopah tokah cuz I'll choke ya then I'll smoke ya
Lord Digga is the big black spade in the grave and little son of Satan
Master is the ace man that hooks up the beats with bass
Mix between norm and the jinx
And I'm the deuce in ya hand, the talk of the mass
The thrilla, I eat fruit loops the cereal killa
The four man dream team wreckin' all evenin' odds
The deadly deck of cards dealer of the gods
The extra terrifical lyrical spiritual scientifical
Hypnotical and mystical intellectual poetry
Made for da mind destroyin' mankindLet's get wild
Yeah, Master Ace in the house
The whole Action Posse's in the house
Ice-U-Rock's in the house, DJ Marley Marl's in the house
Steady Pace is in the house, and we gonna do it like this

So many New Jacks and Jills on the hill
But only one bucket, so fuck it, they get the dills
Cause you no frills, that means your name ain't household
Now watch that little mouse fold
You can't take the pressure from the cooker
Stood there looking soft, so I started hooking off
And took her, I know she used to be yours
Now she's riding on the bus with us and doing tours
Along with some other little runts
We call her a fall girl, she does so many stunts
And then she got liver, she did it with the guy that drives the bus
Now she's a screw driver
Master Ace is flipping
Your grip is slipping, it's time I start stripping
Young ladies and the titles that hold 'em
I treat 'em like a pretzel: bend, stretch, and fold 'em
And I can do the same damage on stage
Black, white, or beige, you're gonna feel the rage
The same way the sluts with the big butts felt it
I'm not a dealer but I dealt it
So if you plan on riffing when I spank ya
Be prepared to grab your ankles because

(Ace is wild!) No, not really
(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
(Ace is wild!) Come on, stop illing

For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for all of those
Who lost out, cause I was at the polls
And I saw the results as they came in
So many wild-ass ones that need taming
But I hold a whip and a chair
And I don't play fair, so you'd better stay there
Until I say "Jump through the fire"
But I won't get burned, I learned to admire
]From way across the room first
And after I study, buddy, that's when I kick a verse
That's high powered, you got devoured
By the jaws of death, you little coward
Scared to step in this arena
Where the grass is greener, you're looking meaner and meaner
But your look ain't scaring me away
So I just stay and say words to make your head sway
Capital A-C-E, boy
Serving the masses, you'd better take some classes
If you want to hang with this here
And if you get near, I'll eat you like a pear (Crunch)
But I don't really eat a lot of fruit
So say "ahh" (Mmmmmmph!) Now don't you look cute?

(Ace is wild!) Nah, no I'm not
(Ace is wild!) I just like to bug a lot
(Ace is wild!) Leave me alone
(Ace is wild!) Turn up the microphone
(Ace is wild!) Yeah...

Mr. Gangster, who you trying to kid?
Fake, flam, and fess and dress the way you did
This is a microphone war
You say you're well-known, but what are you known for?
A porno flick and a hard dick
And always bragging about the girls you stick
Title for king? Yo I don't compete for that
Paid your dues? Let me see a reciept for that
Somebody put you on yesterday
And you fess today, and that's just the way
A sucker is supposed to operate
Just turn on my mic and I'm straight
Now you fronting like you got a million G's
Just because you sold a couple of LP's
Now you walking around thinking you're the man
Cause you bought a little suit from Dapper Dan
But so what? You still ain't dapper
Holding the mic makes you look like a rapper
But you're just a sloppy copy cat
Front on me and I'm a hit you with a bat
Bottom of the nineth, two out, and I'm at the plate
And SMACK! Over the left field gate
That's where your head goes, you're Rudolph the Red Nosed
And you can't join in, you shouldn't have said those
Rhymes that sound so merrily merrily
Since you're soft like poundcake from Sarah Lee
I might cut a slice, then say "What a nice
Sucker to gobble up with beans and rice"
You fat little rat from the sewer
I eat you like a meal, pass you like maneuer
Put you in the garden where my flower grows
Then where's your power? Tell me where your power goes
Somebody does your dirty work for you
Throw up your hands like a man so I can floor you
And oh, if you pull a jammie
You can run from Brooklyn to Miami
]From Miami to Nevada
You'd better have a lotta, I mean a whole knot of
Payola, cause I'm about to roll a
Mic like a cess joint, so brother here's a bowl of
Pride, now eat it up
Cause I get kind of wild when I heat it up

(Ace is wild!) Nah, not really
(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
(Ace is wild!) Yo yo yo, stop illing
(Ace is wild!) No, I'm not
(Ace is wild!) I feel kinda hot
(Ace is wild!) But I'm not acting wild
(Ace is wild!) You know that ain't my style
(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just cooling
(Ace is wild!) And also I'm ruling
(Ace is wild!) I ain't messing with nobody
(Ace is wild!) I just wanna have a party
(Ace is wild!) No, no
(Ace is wild!) Come on, yo
(Ace is wild!) It's me and Marley Marl
(Ace is wild!) And I'm the Music Man, y'all[Verse One]
Y'all rap careers all headed south like Route 1-9
You're an artist but you only got one design
That's a name you can underline
It's dark underground but I don't wait for the sun to shine
Every rapper on their summer grind
Some are deaf, some are dumb and some are blind
I'm in the first category cause I can't hear ya niggas, tell your label I'm the one to sign
I'm the one they should run and find
Who can do what I do?Not that many come to mind
When it come to rhyme - I'm like Dr.Seuss
Not a crip but got some shit that can stop a truce
Prosecutor and I got the proof
Rappers say they got a lot of money but that's not the truth
When I spit you can lock the booth
And throw away the key, what you see here'll shock the youth
Cause any rapper in my age range must've failed and looking to get a grade change
But I crush that theory when you look and you hear me, you know what you see is way strange
Lot of niggas off their A games
I diss 'em all but I ain't sayin names
But if I'm forced and I have to
You know that I will, better chill before I come at you
Ace

[Hook]
"Listen closely"
"I am the man in charge"
"Yeah"
"Diamon in the back"
"You know the ammo"
"No biting allowed"

[Verse Two]
Yeah, we go together like sweater and hat
With Diamond on the track what could be better than that?
To be contestant with just a incredible ?
Cookin up a main cause with this eateble rap
The game of life is like a knife, dead in the back
Watch how you walk or get caught with your leg in the trash
The first step is they gon' ask what colors you rep
The red, white and the blue or the green,red and the black
They always try to make us pick up a side
I refuse to be one of them dudes they kick aside
I am still a great force to be reckoned with
Diggin In The Crates, that's who I'm reppin' with
Yup, y'all ain't used to this sort of skills
We've been nice since British Walkers and quaterfields
And y'all can have all them singin' thugs
The Ace and Dime are still greater than the king of clubs

[Hook]

"You wanna get this"[Hook]
Pay homage, respect
Yeah, one-two
Acknowledge the rep
I don't know what you cats was thinking
Pay homage, respect
Musta been crazy
Acknowledge the rep
To step up on stage, at CMJ, mention my name

[Verse 1]
I hear these cats, but I ain't listening
A little faint dissing, a little scratch, a little paint missing
But I still gleam and glisten, hot like a stream of pissing
I'm about to have your whole team wishing
That you never got this shit started
You about to be dearly departed
You gotta be nearly retarded
To let me hear my name mentioned, tryna gain attention
Now I'm running through this game lynching
And I heard a few cats tryna take shots on the low
These XFL rappers tryna fuck with a real pro
One thing; who named y'all the High and the Mighty
To me, y'all just sound like a couple of high whities
You had to be on mad coke and ecstasy
To think for a second, you can stand next to me
Look don't ever again mention my name in your freestyles
Or I'll cut off your transmission faster than Lee Myles
And I heard your album, this must be something you're new at
Cause I'd rather hear a Lil' Wayne/Lil' Zane duet
My cellphone stay ringing like a slap in the ear
So I hope y'all don't plan on making rap a career
Cause ever since Heav' was in Vernon I been burning
Next year, y'all be up in Rawkus, interning
And I shoulda let it known what your government names are
To make sure you Take It Personal like Gang Starr, motherfuckers

[Hook]
I got one lyric, pointed at your head for start
Another one, is pointed at your weak ass heart
And that go for any other so called rap cats, in the game
Pay homage, respect
Acknowledge the rep
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
And believe me, I ain't forget about him, naw
Pay homage, respect
Nope, acknowledge the rep
Just you wait
Acknowledge the rep

[Verse 2]
Yeah I heard of the Boogiemann when I was a youth, scary
And I found out that he was as fake as a tooth-fairy
Since my last mission this nigga's been ass-kissing
I took a minute, I gave your single a fast listen
Tell me this, with no pot to piss in, how you dissing
Your group homes are about to be reporting you missing
And I don't know what was worse, the track or the verse
I'mma get to your producer, but I'm smacking you first
See I couldn't even find one nigga that heard of you
I did find a few cats that wanted to murder you
But I told 'em chill, I let 'em know you was my son
And I promise I can pay support til' you twenty-one
Consider me the clothes on your back and a warm meal
Who knows, this might just get you a deal
And the day that your album go on sale for the first hour
Just remember like Nas nigga, I Gave You Power
I figured I give ya some help, cause you need lots
I make your producer change his name to Speed Nottz
Tell him I say fuck him for doing the tracks
Matter of fact, fuck Fat Beats, for doing the wax
I'mma diss you via e-mail and then through a fax
I'mma diss you by two-way, I ain't gon' never relax
I'mma diss you over fast, slow track or no track
If your shit wasn't so whack, I dissed you to your track
You that little fish that I catch and I throw back
And by the way, give 50 Cent his flow back
You that cat in the club that get hit with a bottle
Fucking with me, you better off trying to hit lotto
And don't answer back, this is hard shit to follow
And you can't spit nigga, so you obviously must swallow
MotherfuckerHere come the jams, yo punks, guard your domes
It's the man with the mad new styles and funky poems
So strike one, strike two, strike three, you're out
Of luck, Jack, fuck that, grab your nuts and shout
(Ain't you the Masta?) Yep, I've always been
And then, I'm a stab a fucking critic with his pen
So write that, put that in your magazine and stick it
I'm wicked, just like a witch when I kick it
So break out your charts and scales and try to rate me
Give me a one, son, yep I hope you hate me
Cause I'm a keep on bringing it, I'm swinging it
Sharp like glass til your punk ass is swinging it
Riff-raff, your whole damn staff I have to cut up
I drop bombs, I'm fatter than your moms, so what up?
I come from the planet of raps on, oh yeah
Beam me up Steady, there's no skills down here
So there, you little punk sitting in your chair
Soon you're gonna know the score kids, I swear

(Ain't you the Masta?) Yep, I'm the Masta (Repeat 4x)

I hits you hard kids, you're barred from the mic and
Rhymes kick like Pele, rough like a dyke and
Praise me, Masta, off beat, the healer
Rap style's deisel like an 18-wheeler
So get that weak style out of my path
I'm turbo, I drop lines long like Nostrand Ave
So danger, I'm burning from Monday to Sunday
I'm hot like some niggas 10 deep in a Hyndai
So make way, I drop mad heavy like the Fridge
I'm sacking, you're wack and you're over like the bridge
This little rabbit tried to diss me, but fuck it
I got duckets, one day that rabbit kicks the bucket
You know (I know) You know (I know)
You know, you know, well yo follow where I go
Jane, stop this crazy thing if I sing
Some love shit and dress mad fly, I'd be the king
And be seen on the covers of like 27 books
But I'm too proud to beg, so suck this, you crooks
You're only as good as your last jam, it's true
Your shit's new, everybody wants an interview
But then, oh how quick they forget
With no hit, they like "Who's that?" They full of shit
And straight up, my patience is starting to wear short
I'm gonna land blows like your head was an airport
Say cheese you theif, let me see your teeth
Cause I'm Ultra-magnetic, magnetic like Kool Keith
So abra, cadabra, presto and change-o
The off-beat, on-beat style is kinda strange yo
It dops here, it drops there, it's off then it's on
To the breaka, to the breaka, to the breaka of umm dawn
Here I come with bones by the sack for
Spraypaint, I tage my f-ing name on your back, punk

(Ain't you the Masta?) Yep, I'm the Masta (Repeat 4x)[Intro]
Lets sing and learn about the letters of the alphabet

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
A son, how you B?
"Aiyo I'm chillin"
And I C you D to go out, and make a killin', but where E?
"F that nigga he making G's on tour with H-Town doing shows overseas"
Yeah I heard he DJ'd but stop hatin' OK? (I ain't hatin')
Smoke your L and chill the fuck out, I found a way to get paid
You know how I M, we gonna be N
Cuz my cousin Tyriq said, to meet him about ten
"Now that's that shit that I'm talking about
So yo let me just take this leak and then we out"
O now you gotta P, well hurry up it's quarter two
And I just got this beep from son, and that's the Q
R you ready? (Coming) hurry, I'll be in the S-10 Blazer
Out front, he blowing up my pager
"Aiyo I hope this nigga's about getting cash
Cuz mom's is about to evict my broke ass"
Chill, my cousin's like the 2001 Mr. T
Rock mad ice and platinum, watch U gonna see
He pushin a 600, with color TV in the visor
And got more gadgets, than MacGuiver (ooh)
We gonna make dough on the W ain't seen
In your lifetime or my lifetime yo mad cream
Oh shit, you seen that car that drove by? (Yeah)
Well that was his X-ho Lisa, and that was Y
He told us to drive through the hood and if we caught her
Take back that 300-Z that he just bought her, so what's up
"Nigga I don't give a fuck, whatever we gotta do
We can take the bitch car, the money and jewels too
Make this u-turn, we'll catch her at the light
And get right, off of this quick jooks tonight
I don't give a fuck"

[Outtro][Intro: Masta Ace]
Yeah, yeah, I ain't playin man
Straight up and down, yeah
Uh, c'mon, yeah
Uh, you recordin?
Uh-huh... I hope so

[Verse One: Masta Ace]
Aiyyo, Arts & Entertainment is the acronym
For these two amazing American-Africans
This is ab-verbal-robics like we at the gym
Alternatin' on these verses, I go after him
Yeah

[Verse Two: Edo G]
Edo, earned everything far from easily
Equal to Ace, so we split the pie up evenly
I stay fly like Amelia Earhart
Eclipse any emcee, within an earshot

[Verse Three: Masta Ace]
Aiyyo, I got an alter-ego name Ace Avenger
His agender is to annihilate pretenders
And trust he know how to adapt
He's able to adjust his esophagus and swallow a track

[Verse Four: Edo G]
Yo, my efficiency is effortless
I'm ego trippin, evil spittin, check the effectiveness
Edo's era was eighty-six
No escape, I'm the EPITOME of everything, eject your tape

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious]
Look what they do, this what we do
You know what it is and you know what I mean
And you can if you want, be a part of my team
See we got what you want, what you needed was this
If you still wanna know what the difference is
Look what they do, this what we do
Look what they do, this what we do
Look what they do, this what we do
Look what they do, this what we do

[Verse Five: Masta Ace]
Hey! This is Ace not Ashton now that's who Punked ya!
I'm 'bout to stick it to you like acupuncture
Awesome audio, this is me at a glance
Sounds arrogant, but y'all never had a chance
I'm so adamant, let this black man advance
Adios; Au revoir; nigga Spanish, France, uh huh!

[Verse Six: Edo G]
Yeah! I stomp rappers with a elephant's foot
Elevate educate the way the way the elements should
I eliminate embarrassments eliquently
Elusive ivy league you elfs is elementary

[Verse Seven: Masta Ace]
I got the answers you ain't gotta ask who got 'em?
I attract like a ass in some Apple Bottoms
Grab a throttle accelerate, grab a bottle
Cause the average asshole can't bag a model
Now alleviate your anger with some alcohol
Go back to booze and academics out the mall
Get apprehended one August afternoon
Do ten months then come back after June

[Verse Eight: Edo G]
Yeah! The A&E emblem is embedded
Establish a new economy never end dead it
Ed O's the MC, Rich is the engineer
Endless endeavors that could end your career

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious]

[Verse Nine: Masta Ace]
Aiyyo, I used to drive a Audi and a Astro van
Now I want a Aston Martin, nigga that's the plan
Acura's and Altima's are average cars
I want that A-RAB Money like Abdul-Jabbar, c'mon

[Verse Ten: Edo G]
Yo, my embargo can get you all licked like an envelope
Married to the game, then elope
You eager for my involvement
Kill you rappers, while Ace is the emballment

[Verse Eleven: Masta Ace]
You sound asinine braggin 'bout the ass you got
Back up, give me some space like an astronaut
And assume my associates, the accurate shot
Aims at the oblongata and the back of the knot
BLOAW!

[Verse Twelve: Edo G]
Yo, it's evident your events are promotional
And your employees is way too emotional
You don't wanna engage us and stage us
It's dangerous, then you rappers become endangered
I'm eco-friendly, Ace is addicted to detail
Smoke you like emphysema, send it in an e-mail
What I embody you ALL should embrace
A&E, E&A, Edo and Ace, nigga

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious]

[Outro: Masta Ace]
YEAH!
You are now tuned in to.. A&E!
Ace & Ed
HEY! H-HEY!
The Dynamic Duo
Arts & Entertainment
Don't change the channel
Don't touch that dail
Yeah[Verse One] [Edo G.]:
Yo, your shit went wood like a splinter
I write till there's no more ink in the printer
A winner, it's all from the soul in the inner
You rapper couldn't find ice in the middle of winter
Fresh like the N.E.R.D.s from Virginia
You wack like the herbs from the 'burbs who's pretenders
Jigmasta, DJ Spinna
Pockets heavy, yours are thinner, far from beginner
You a sugar substitute, Splenda
Any gender, who's a contender, must surrender
I keep a stash full of legal tenders
In case robbers wanna hold me up like suspenders
I spit that flavor, taste it on your tongue
Youth gets wasted on the young, I'm the shits like dung
It's all from the power of the lungs
You got it spend it, Ego G is authentic

[Scratch Hook]:
"Too tough to fold too hot to hold" - Pitch Black 'It's All Real'
"I never seen no kid like that"
I'm authentic

[Verse Two] [Masta Ace]:
Ayo most rappers fold like cheap chairs
And real talent only comes around now and then like leap years
And like Goldie Locks And The Three Bears
I'm just right
And just might write a verse to beat theirs
I'm indeed competitive
I listen to these niggas late at night if I need a sedative
I don't wanna hate but I can't lie
Think I'd rather sit around and watch some paint dry
You dudes bore me
And this book's in need of a new story
And lyrically I'm the father and you Maury
You just a talk show host, I'm hot
You get burnt if you walk so close, you not
On my level, I'm bout to get on my rebel
Without a pause shit
I bet real niggas endorse it
And write they name on the dotted line, they gotta sign
Ain't too many flows as hot as mine
I'm authentic

[Scratch Hook]:
"Too tough to fold too hot to hold" - Pitch Black 'It's All Real'
"I never seen no kid like that"
I'm authentic[Masta Ace]
As I walk through the valley of one eighty-seven land
No matter what state, what city, what town
I can see there's no place to run, no place to hide
I could be in the crosshairs of somebody, somewhere
I wanna ask why...
But I ain't got time for that
I gotta keep movin on
Or be the next one to die
I walk through the valley of no-man's land
Sayin peace, slappin fives and holdin up those two fingers
To the many nine millimeter automatic pistol toting young men
That roam everywhere
I wonder what will be the next small incident
That will cause one of them to pull out
And spray bullets recklessly in every direction
Will my grandmother be on her way to the store
For a loaf of bread and a TV Guide at that very moment
As I walk through the valley at night
I'm thinkin, "I don't know that brother walkin across the
Street in the black hoodie, so he may be a threat to me"
He's thinkin, "I don't know that brother walkin across the
Street in the blue hoodie, so he may be a threat to me"
What's goin through out minds
As we reach down into our waistlines
And pull out the tools, the heaters, the scraps
The biscuits, the gats
The jammies, the grips with the clips
All placed there purposely by them
"Here niggas, sixteen shooter made specially just for you"
What goes through our minds at that moment
When a brother's at the other end of our barrel
About to catch a hot piece of steel
And take his last breath
What goes through our minds
What's goin through our minds
As we walk through the valley[Intro]
Yeah, BK, Uptown, Boogie Down, Queens
It's beautiful

[Verse 1]
Listen, I got a lot to say
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today, I have to laugh on the real
The aftermath's kind of ill like I'm Dr. Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
This game make you get jaded, I just hate it (just hate it)
But this song gives a different kind of feeling
It's a new kind of dealing, it's a special kind of healing (uh huh)
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz? You know what it is
Positive over negative, see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster (that's right)
I rise up above
See, people still showing me love
Got the respect without dropping a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new hit, you can pop in the deck
It's beautiful

[Hook]
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is brand new Uptowns still in the box
This is the Yankees, 10-nothing, killing the Sox
This ain't hugging the block with a gat in your hand
This is Boca Raton on a catamaran (that's right)
With the sun beaming down where you at in the sand
I feel like I'm more than a cat with a plan
This feels like it's more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in your hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
That's why I stole this mic, y'all don't hold this right (nope)
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack, no a glass of Henny (that's right)
Now drink it up 'til there ain't nothing left in it
I'm repping it, BK, that's a definite
Just more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(I'm wishing on a, on a, on...) the most beautifullest thing ever
And it's here to bring terror to the bling era (yeah)
You can feel it in your inner
It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving dinner
It's like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark (swish)
It's that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat gon' use it
I see a black man aiming his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claiming his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down with Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it cause it brought us here
It's a young mother braiding her daughter's hair
It's beautiful

[Hook][Verse One: Masta Ace]
Walking through my hood feeling good about my destiny
I realize that God's only testing me
I can't complain cause when I look at the game
I see dudes that got a whole lot less than me
A lot of dudes got a lot more stress than me
I'm Looking Out The Front Door like Extra P
Other cats still stuck in the backyard
Everyone running round like a track squad
Just cause you rap hard, don't mean the fans care
Cause you can have a lot of hype, a lot of fan fair
It don't mean your air play is gon' match that
Heavy row you be happy to get half that
When I think about it, I'm quite fortunate
Cause this is something that I never made a fortune with
But looking at the grand scheme of things
It was never 'bout them black Benz and Beamer dreams

[Scratch Hook]
"It was all a dream" - Notorious B.I.G. 'Juicy'
"A never ending saga when I rap to these beats" - Gang Starr 'The Squeeze'
"Never forget where you came from
Never forget where you got your name from
And the game from" - Cali Agents 'Neva Forget'
"Now before making records the hood was my savior" - Lords Of The Underground 'Tic Toc'
"New York, New York" - Rakim 'New York, New York'
"Are you ready?"
"Original heads represent the Brooklyn all night" - The Crooklyn Dodgers 'Crooklyn'

[Verse Two: Strick]
Where I'm from, record label niggas won't come
They say they will, get you all thrilled and don't come
Damn, I think I said that on an old joint
Cause it was true and you dudes kinda missed the whole point
Yeah, so then I bounced to see some other places
Try some new ideas, see some other faces
I even tried to take a break from rapping
Then I decided to break so I could make it happen
When I'm home I see the same cats I started with
Trying to start their career with the same starter kit
My phone rings but I'm scared to answer
Cause they gon' ask me some things that I don't really care to answer
It's not that I'm the greatest or I'm balling out
It's just that I'm good where I'm at and that's what it's all about
But looking at the grand scheme of things
It was never 'bout them black Benz and Beamer dreams

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Masta Ace]
Was I rapping hoping I could cop a black five?
Prolly, I wanted to be one of those rap guys
Popping the champagne cork getting baptized
But God said "no" and the boat capsized
Then I washed up on shore and discovered that
If you doing this and don't have a love of rap
If you covet that crown for the king of things
You just living for them black Benz and Beamer dreams

[Scratch Hook][Masta Ace]
'New York, Big City of Dreams'
To get by, cats doing plenty of things
It's a honest hustle, but you gotta have some kind of muscle
Either it's that or you sign with Russell
Cause nowadays an average cat can flow decent
So in your sparetime you can go to the precinct
Let me introduce you to some cats who won't shoot you
Everyday they spend in the pen is so crucial
They got kids to feed, wifes to hug
Their jobs are so strange, their lives are bug
Look, my nigga Al had a store in his trunk
And the place under the dash where he store his pump
He had them white and white 'Air Force Ones' for 40 ($)
And them iddy-biddy-kiddy ones for shorty
He was just trying to survive the recession
Now he's locked up for stolen goods and gun posession
My nigga Neek had them furs for cheap
He bought a two family home, an Excursion Jeep
But word got around he was doing it big
Cops ran up in his crib, now he's doing a bid
Now Jose was making money hand over fist
He had a legitimate job with a little bit of a twist
Besides me and my man, I've known people
He sold stuff too, out of the back of Home Depot
Everything from new tools to kitchen sinks
And he was just trying to get rich it stinks
Cause now he lost his job and his mortgage due
And he can't afford a lawyer, man dog is through, oooh
We were lying on schemes and scams
Just so we could realize our dreams and plans, man
This ain't America is it?
It don't take much for the cops to come pay you a visit
But do what you gotta do, fuck them laws
Life is a test you better up them scores
Listen, I ain't trying to survive, I'm trying to live
And here is some advise I been dying to give
They don't care if you sell it to inner section
Republicans run for office and win election
Who's in the inner section, see my pen erecting
This for my cats that just been effecting
From Brownsville and Watts, it's down steal the spots
It won't stop untill we're down killin cops
It's a revolution, you believe in god, or evolution
Either way dog, we need a resolution like Deemer
A man got sentenced to a year
And when he get out, it's another street career
It's a vicious cycle
For every kid who ball in the park and wish he Michael
Listen the world don't like you, but
You better keep it moving, you better keep improving
You love my voice, ain't it deep and soothing
I'm saying fuck fame, I'm having a no-name
Platinum and gold chain, and saying
I'mma beat 'em at their own game[Masta Ace]
Woke up this morning hearing shots below my project window
The TV's on from playing all night on Nintendo
Jumped out of bed tryin to see what's up with all the noise and
I see somebody else has caught a case of lead poison
This type of shit around my way is a regular occurance
Because the same shit just happened to my nigga Terrence
A week later now somebody else is laying dying
Surrounded by a crowd of people and his momma crying
The way he's laying there it looks to me that he's a goner
I seen the cats who just did it run around the corner
I start to wonder who it is and why they had to wet him
I bet I knew him or at least I bet I probably met him
I can't pretend I'm shocked like electrocution
Cuz any night there could be an execution
My momma told me that that thug shit will get you buried
The next day there's your name in the obituary
I asked her why we gotta live in this environment
She said Your grandfather drank up his retirement
Plus when I fucked around and had you I was just a baby
Just maybe if I wasn't being miss lady
Things could've been a little bit better
Threw on my jeans and my double knit sweater
I hit the block tryin to find out who got done in
Who had the gun and who that was I seen running

[Hook]
Another body on the ground cold and
Another day another lost soul and
Same shit in every zip code
No matter where you go
Its just another block episode
Another story on the street told and
Another turn down the wrong road and
Sit back and watch it unfold
Yo I'll let you know
Just another block episode

[Punchline]
Yo, I roam the streets with my peeps and the gun by my crotch
I got beef with this cat that resides on my block
He getting popped I swear when I see him it's on
He'll just be a tattoo on his best friends arm
My friends screaming "Punch be calm" y'all can save it
He borrowed 5 G's two months ago, still ain't pay it
This girl hit me on the cell about his location
I grabbed my gun jumped in the hoopty then I started racing
Turned off the lights a block away so he don't peep the caper
I see him and a bunch of cats by the bodega
Don't wanna kill him I just wanna teach this cat a lesson
Stepped on the gas grab the gun cocked back the weapon
Shot up the whole corner but hit him in the kneecap
That's cool cuz dead niggas can't pay your cash back
I'm nutting to laugh at I keep bad temper
I hit him a bystander and one of his crewmembers
(gunshot)

[Wordsworth]
Yo yo yo yo, last thing I heard was a blast car circling past
I wasn't nervous thought they might be searching for gas
Soon as Rob came out dispersing the trash
Car sped and lead went through his windows curtains and glass
Dove in the dirt and the grass
I look bullet struck my right arm
Glass in my left palm I lost my neck charm
I knew it was Punch cuz Rob owed him money
But never had it always got new kicks and gear to match it
I'm in the ambulance I thought that beef was squashed
That's why when he seen Punch he crossed the street and dodged
See Rob's records with the DA is forfeit
My records 4.0 GPA going to Harvard
Athletes 100 miles and running he's a convict
Other hand my high school football team I lead in yardage
Boys regardless blood pressure dropped artery vessel clogged
Cardiac arrest next my chest was shocked IV
Oxygen mask bleeding heavily
We need to get to the hospital fast I'm doing 70
Why I gotta be a casuality of war? Did good most my life
My career was growing gradually and more
Hearing "hold on, you'll be alright, you're gonna make it"
Sirens up ahead construction on the pavement
Slowed down from this moment I didn't have a chance
Seein' hazards, flash can't believe I died in the traffic jam

(*ambulance siren*)[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Here comes the boom, with the hip hop bash as I smash and crash
How many gangsta rappers are gonna last?
Not one, they got done, I had fun
Doin em and screwin em and booin em and chewin em
I'm slick and I'm quick, up my sleeve is a trick
Hey! So what, I use funky drummers, suck my dick
I'm still thick, with murderous beats and heavy kick
And I'm sick of the so-called shots ya gonna lick
I slam and I slam and I slam, did I mention that I slam
Don't eat spinach but I yam what I yam
Death-defyin like a circus, I work this
Mic, you can't jerk this, off-beat on purpose
I never smoke dope, I don't carry a nine
I ain't no hustler with bitches on my mind
Gangstas are swimming in the water but comin' up shorter
I oughta, boom bash and slaughta

[Hook]X4
I boom and I bash and I bash and I boom
Check it

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
I'mma break it down, and I do mean down, yo way down
So far down-down the devil gonna call it underground
Niggas betta know the fuckin score
Cuz I'm Raw, like Eddie
And like confetti they get tore
Up, from the floor, up
There's no time
And my spits gettin sprayed in ya face as I rhyme
So run run run, ya better head for the hills
Get ya gun gun gun, and ya cyanide pills
Get the rope for ya neck, and the razor for your wrists
Cuz I'm pissed, and it's suicide to battle this
Ummm, highly explosive, material
Grand imperial, pour me on cereal
Cuz I flow from the belly of a cow
Wipe ya brow, how ya like me now

[Hook]X4
I boom and I bash and I bash and I boom
Check it

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
But you can't get with the man with the mad snap hat
I take em out with one blow to the cerebellum
And tell 'em, my jam's so funky that you can smell 'em
With 26 styles I enter, I bent the-
Rapper like a pole, yo I'm cold like winter
Rhyme for rhyme, head to head with a one go
I come from Crooklyn, it's wild like a jungle
Yeah, you might get a cap jack, ya act mack
I carry a can of flat black in my napsack
Lookin for a wall to tag up, I dag up
And rag up, a nigga yo digga raise the flag up
I click click my heels, and good is how it feels
There's no place like home and chrome on ya wheels
Make it through the project, dance if I choose to
Hope I didn't lose you, bruise you, I cruise through
The neighborhood, in a Chevrolet Impala
Drop to the ground and makin' the girls holla
Rollin, rollin, rollin, I'm rollin
Sorry officer, the car ain't stolen
I really don't care what you thought of me
I oughta be, far from orderly
In my fashion, I boom and I bashin'

[Hook]X4
I boom and I bash and I bash and I boom
Check it[Verse 1]
Brainiac, dumb-dumb, bust the scientifical
Approach to the course and the force is centrifugal
Can you find ya way through the lyrics that be catching em
Throw another rhyme across the room they be fetching em
And they take a loss, take a loss to the Master and I
Throws crazy blows and they knows I be plastering
All across the room on the ceilings and the walls too
Punk little suckers didn't know I had the gall to
Come around they block with my cocked-diesel system and
Turn it up to 10 and then start to diss them and
They didn't wanna battle if they did when they saw me
They'd a opened up they trunk but they try to ignore me
Hey little suckers I know you hear me callin you
Thought you wanted some but I see that you all into
Frontin ain't no future in your frontin so let's get it on
Like Marvin Gaye,(hey) take the cash and sit it on
The hood of ya wick-wack low-ridin Cadillac
Back up ya boys and let's start the battle
Act like, ya know, the Masta Ace don't play when it come to my bass, aahhhh

[Hook]
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll (repeat several)

[Verse 2]
Drivin down the block like what else should a brother do
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might smother you
Rolling down my windows yeah I have a air-conditioner
But I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to
Waitin at a red light, Kentucky Fried Chicken in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking in
See this Puerto Rican Latin Chico Rico Suave
In a red Corolla eh yo does he wanna play
Pullin up beside me, looking like he want it
Show me what you got then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we can't hear they horns
Cause he music a grande yeah he got it goin on
But I think I better school him cause he don't know the time
So I'm turnin up the boom cause he cannot mess with mine
Brothers hear me hitting from like 50 blocks away I
Wanna turn they heads so you know I gotta play
High decibels passing through a residential district
See a few cuties and I turn it up like Bisquick
Mira, mira man don't sleep, I got tha, I got tha, I got the woofers in my Jeep

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Black boy, black boy turn that shit down
You know that America don't wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum jungle music go back to Africa
Nigga I'll arrest you if you holding up trafffic
I'll be damned if I listen, so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
I'm breaking ear drums while I'm breaking the law
I'm disturbing all the peace cause Sister Souljah said war
So catch me if ya can, if you can here's a donut
Cause once you drive away, yo I'm gonna go nuts
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya can't stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it, they probably start dancing
Jumpin on my tip and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis
Strictly the hardcore dirty street level hits
God's on my side so watch what the devil gets
Positivity hitting 50 levels deep
Coming out, they coming out the woofers in my Jeep

[Hook]Artist: Master Ace
Album: Take A Look Around
Song: Brooklyn Battles

Intro

Mmm...yeah, that sound kinda ill...word...yeah... Master Ace in the
Studio with my man Marley Marl, y'know... Got DJ Clash in the
House...and my DJ, Steady Pace on the cut, right? [Doin' the rest]
Right, so I'm about to get into somethin' here...

Verse 1

I'm Master Ace, from a place
Or should I say borough
Where they like the bass to be thorough
With the kick of a mule
And the click of a tool with no bullets
In the clip, it's the trick of a fool
Cuz he who fronts gets blunts you can't smoke
To pull such stunts is no joke
You better know where you are first
Try to be rude and get chewed like a Starburst
Now how much juice you got?
You couldn't hang if I made a noose and knot
Now try that on for size
Too much baseball, too many apple pies
Click your heels three times, kid
And now you can see what my rhymes did
Suckers and nerds come in herds just like cattle
First I brand them, then I hand them a rattle
So they can make a little noise in protest
Those that fussed got bust wearin' no vest
I told that MC to go West
Let's see who can put on a show best
The creep that tried to sleep got no rest
I got a rap that can trap a slow pest
Where's your girl? She's out on a ho quest
Fingernail tips, red lips, summer stroll dressed
In a camisole she's a pro blessed
With a great big backside but no breasts
Welcome to the fire pit
I know some kids that wish you'd worn some flyer shit
Cuz as soon as you stepped off the train
They woulda put a big nine to your brain
Be on the lookout, and yo, keep lookin'
Cuz there's a battle goin' on in Brooklyn

Verse 2

Just like the water in a river flows, I'm fluid
And as I do it, I deliver blows
So MCs, you better keep your left up
Try to fight and you might just get F'd up
Cuz I'll terminate, as you learn a great lesson
Don't ever try messin' or you'll earn a fate
Worse than death cuz I'm here to give it to ya
You got a life, but don't know how to live it do ya?
I live on a day-to-day basis
Doin' my shows in all kinds of places
You sit home with a frowned-up grill
Talkin' 'bout who ya gonna kill
Well listen up psychopath
Put down the Uzi, stop tryin' to play Shaft
Cuz life ain't a TV screen
Bullets can puncture the skin, rupture the spleen
And the stuff that flows out your veins ain't ketchup
Sit back, relax as I sketch up
The scene on a Brooklyn street on a late night
It was a great fight to me
I was just an innocent bystander
Let me try and, uh, explain why I'd hand a
Brother a big fat stick
Well it was that, or get his black ass kicked
See, it was five against one
But this brother was too proud to run
So he stood in like a trooper
Fightin' against all odds against a group of
Brothers that looked the same way he looked, friend
It was a battle in Brooklyn[Intro]
"This is the place where stars are born" - MC Shan
"And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin" - MC Lyte

[Bekay]
The big city of dreams, feel pity for fiends
Gritty shifty in schemes, pretty shitty it seems
But we walkin on the gold mine, lovin this place
Ace, Babu, Coalmine, up in your face
Along with - introducin Bekay on the mic
I stare right at Flatbush Ave when I'm prayin at night
Some pack gats, leavin other cats blasted
And even the white chicks be rockin fat asses
Always hot, not just when the summer here
Coney Island cyclonin it, or jumpin on the wonder wheel
Fiends on the floor look for crack 'til they knees break
Or Puff could be a dick and make you walk here for cheesecake
Ain't no war, but we rock camouflauge
Ridin bikes, one on the pegs and one up on the handlebars
If you poppin shit y'all kids is just hatin
On the home of Biggie Smalls and the original Nathan's
Go door to door, see we more than sorta raw
And you can cop anything you ever really needed in corner store
Where everybody says they sell crack
And the DT's all dressed up in the old Giants throwbacks
It kinda gets me alive, cause when I'm up in the hood
Half them dudes yo they think I'mma cop (BE-KAY!)
Embrace it as heaven, stars is born
In this place, where Masta Ace is a legend
Anywhere else ain't breakin me fam
Cause I grew up in Brooklyn, these streets yo, they made me a man
What'chu poppin? Your crew lame (IS BROOKLYN IN THE HOUSE~!?)
You know we are son, the top of the food chain

[Hook 2X: scratched]
"This is the place where stars are born"
("Go Brooklyn") "You know the place!" - Lyte
"This is the place where stars are born"
"And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin"

[Masta Ace]
I'm from the B-R-double-O-K, L-Y-N
If I wasn't, then why would I yell I am?
You see, this be the home of Spike Lee
Folks think it's dangerous - I don't know it might be slightly
But that depends on which blocks you be steppin down
Cause certain neighborhoods they never put they weapon down
I lived in Flatbush, grew up in Brownsville
And every now and then you see me around Steele
I used to hang a lot in Bushwick, Decatur and Evergreen
Some of the best parties you ever seen
I lived in Clinton Hills, on Myrtle Ave, near Fort Greene
I screwed up my face hard and walked mean
I spent a lot of time in East Medina, where the police are meaner
And I wish the streets was cleaner
Cause it's crime every where, it ain't fair, but who care?
Not the Governor and not the new Mayor
I guess we forced to live this kind of life
If you ask me, Brooklyn be the best place to find a wife
If you want a chick to hold you down, and have your back
Brooklyn be the ideal habitat
Cause she ain't havin that, let's hit the par where we gather at
Form a cipher, and spit a battle rap
You wanna come through you need a referral
It's M.A. and Bekay in the song about my borough, c'mon

[Hook][Verse 1]
I met her on the corner of Gates and Bedstuy
It was only right that I approached and said hi
Cause she looked like no other chick I ever saw
She was on her way coming up out the cornerstore
I asked could I carry your bags and walk her home
I can tell she was new in New York just from her tone
Cause she wasn't that typical rude and ignorant, teeth-sucking and
Eye-rolling telling me to leave her alone
We dipped and we yapped, we chit and we chat
About this and that and where she lived at, yeah
This may sound kinda Wu Tang Clan-ish
But this butter-pecan honey was not Spanish
She lived like three blocks from my man
In New York for six months, moved from Pakistan
Well that explains the strange accent and the strange clothes
And that cute little diamond in your nose
She said, I gotta wear this gear every Sunday but
You gotta see how I look on Monday, word
Meaning I can see you again, maybe
Give you a call, take you out on the weekend
She winked at me and kinda laughed
Ripped a piece of the grocery bag and wrote her math
You can bet your last damn dollar
That I'mma give you a call, Brooklyn Masala

*scratches*(Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you) - Nas

[Hook]
Can we walk and talk, share our worlds
I'm feeling you a whole lot more than most girls
If you give me the number I'll holla
I wanna see you again Brooklyn Masala
B to the K to the
B to the K to the
B to the K to the L to the Y to the N
Masala

[Verse 2]
On our first date, knocked on the door around eight
When she came down she smelled good and looked great
She had the tight Frankie B's on, white on white Ones
A pink bubble goose and pink bubblegum, I'm like, damn
Even pink Chanel shades, her long black hair was done up in box braids
She didn't have the Maybeline face, that was all dead
Instead she had a red dot on her forehead
C-cup's pumping, looking real ill
You wanna see Lord Of The Rings or Kill Bill
She looked at me and said, neither one
Cause there really ain't no Black stars in either one
So what you wanna do girl
She kinda blushed then
We settled on dinner for two at Justin's
The food was good with no surprises
We had the barbeque shrimp as appetizers
We had the cat fish main course, a few drinks
Then out the front door like Main Source
We stepped out into the big city
She said, the Times Square lights are so pretty
We caught a cab, back to the lab
Stopped kissing long enough to pay the tab
She said, I think we got a nice future
That night learned all about the Kama Sutra, my Masala

[Hook][Intro]

[Verse 1: Strickin]
Stomping through the hood with my chucks on
I knock on every door, who the fucks home
I'm trying to find some trouble I can dabble in
I've been travelling, pockets getting fat again
Apparently you nigga's dont really get it
Flossin' with your bitch thinking I won't really hit it
Yea, she on my line like fish bait, you got a problem
Wait dawg lets get this shit straight, Stricklin
Yea better than these rap-dummies
Watch your tune, got goons that hold a strap for me
A bunch of wild niggas from the mid-weezy
Swerving up the block, chopped listening to Jeezy
And money ain't a thang, on some Jigga shit
This beats right up my alley, its mad niggerish
I tend to get a lil gully when I spit the joint
And don't owe a niggas legs till he get the point
The eMC boys in the booth again, we back in the buildin
Ya we moving in, Yup
And we ain't leavin till the game love us
Punch, Word, Strick, Ace ye the same brothers

[Hook]
Guess who's back for the spell again
Bringing that hell again
What they yelling is
EMC
What they spelling is
EMC
Charly Murphie
More real shit than a lil bit
Any killin it
Everybody feelin it
EmC
And then feelin it
EMC

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Ya, another university is cursing me
Cause I took em off school like a nursery
I know you hate it, but they rated us a full ten
Now we waitin on the call like a bull pen
They want us all back like nose pills(?)
Cause they know we do numbers like phone bills
You lil rap dudes remain in the right lane
While your girl on the pole like a bike chain
Im running through your team like Nitrain
Like a right footers put us in the right frame
Ya'll really wanna get into a place where you learn what the five fingers said to the face
Smack

[Verse 3: Wordsworth]
Google us, but who us?, we the best to choose
Get beat to death, picked up by EMS
Removed, on TV BBC CNN The News
Making moves, keep track, got GPS confused
And we hungry, and we steady peeking at your food
Stomach hurting like we got PMS and rude
With even less to lose ain't sleep slept on snooze
In the lead never left and we suggest the rules
We back

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Punchline]
You boys messing wit a tyrant
Eyes on the paper, I'm the money green giant
Ya'll play the rules of the game, we define em
Start riots, fight hard to peak highest
My crew ain't nothing to play, so dont try us
Hustlas, we sell dreams we dont buy it
Block us from getting this money, we get the fire
Schooled ya'll about this math, ya'll know the science
For years I been on this path with no guidance
Linked up with eMC, my new alliance
My crew the flyest, take over my new assignment
Leader of the pack, who next to be a client
Dont mix with the haters too well, I stay private
Nothin nice to say hater, than stay silent
Blood, sweat n tears, guts and the glory
This is eMC's true Hollywood story

[Outro]
