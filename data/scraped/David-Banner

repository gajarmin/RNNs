[Intro]
David Banner on the beat, bitch

I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
Now can I eat goo, now can I eat you? Mmm

[Verse 1]
I gotta taste for you, now what you wanna do?
Girl, you cold, let me suck out your flu
Girl, you cold, girl, you cool
You heard of Salt N' Pepa? Well girl, you food
Girl, you hot like a bowl of hot stew
And I just stood over ma stew and just blew
And when there's no more of you, in the soup
I remove ma spoon and drink your juice
If you want to do me, do what cha wanna do
If my job is to blow, you can bet she blue
Mic check 1, 2, how about 1, 2
P-L-A-Y because I don't have a clue
But when I find out, I'm a show and tell you
When I lift my top lip, I could still smell you
When I swallow ma spit, I could still taste you
Put that pussy in ma face every time I face you
It goes P-U-S-S-Y
Because it's the reason I am alive
Momma, I need it to stay alive
It's like I gotta eat it just to survive

[Hook]
Hi, I'm the
Pussy monster, the pussy monster
The pussy monster, the pussy monster
And you gotta feed me
Pussy, pussy pussy, pussy pussy
Pussy, pussy pussy, pussy pussy

I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
Now can I eat you? Can I eat you?

[Verse 2]
Now let me get back to her
She call me Dracula, and I'll vacuum her
Catfish, dat fish, dat cat, tuna
I'll smack it up flip it like a spatula
Lil' Chris said 'Run It' and I tackled ya
Baby, can I be the worm in ya apple butt?
Now go back in her, and if you backin' up
I'll suck the front of dat pussy from da back of ya
I'm an urban legend like a black Acura
My taste buds set on a black actress
(Actress) I told her act-shun
(Action) Da camaras is lookin'
And I hope she make me eat ma word cause my words is
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got pussy comin' to me, pussy comin' to me, pussy

And you know I could make it rain, wat ma hurricane tang

Imagine if I did dat with your pearl on ma tongue, ha

Ova her and walk to me
Now walk it out, girl, now walk it out, girl
P-U-S-S-Y
Because it's da reason I am alive
And I'm a need it to stay alive
It's like I gotta eat it just to survive, ha

[Hook][Intro]
Mic check, 1 2
I'm just going to get right to it
Luda!

[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me when it come to getting lyrical
Murdering the rapper and killing beats nigga
I'm cinematic making everybody panic
I be bustin' like a fully automatic feel the heat nigga!
We can battle in the Phantom in Atlanta the rover in Minnesota or the Arizona streets nigga
They sayin' all these offensive lines I snapback it's the quarterback sneak nigga!
One time for the sneak dissers Ol' puss ass fuckboys say my name!
Anybody coming at me know I never back down killing a rapper is my claim to fame!
You lame
And my flow is what expose in these hoes even on a nigga worst day
They say Luda don't want it no mo'
No nigga I'm as hungry as the first day
What you want how you want it you can get I'm the definition of a real g from the south side
The crime scene be the studio get the yellow tape and the chalk and I'm leaving everybody outline
I'm all about mine
Getting paid getting laid getting clothes getting hoes getting green back
Used be like everybody is a lil kid now Big Boy,  outcast like three stacks
Laying all it in the Cadillac with a red bone giving me dome my music on with the seats back
Ludacris this is album number 8 and my pockets gonna be straight
Even if a nigga leak that
Timmy all up on the David Banner track with Janet Jack in the back like "Damn Luda freak that!"
Break it down like you dropping to the ground but we like the 808 in Atlanta so bring the beat back
Sample had to eat that
Couldn't control alt or delete that
But put any other rapper on the track and I guarantee they'll never know how to treat that
I'm a boss I'm a king I'm a legend Imma drill it in your head till you doze off
And I just so happen to be the type of rapper that make your women want to take her clothes off
So let's get to the action
Let's get to the show
I'm been getting to the Forbes list six year straight let's get to the do'
Shout out to the Luda Nation
All my fans just got live
And they waitin' for everybody to put me in the rapper category of ya top five

[Instrumental Bridge]

Let me get it back

[Verse 2]
Ever since I
Came in the game it ain't never been the same
Can't nobody do it like me
Is it ever gonna be another Luda you know that'll never happen that's highly unlikely
Knowing that I'm better than everybody you put me up against I'm in the hall of fame
So fuck call to call we can go bar for bar I'll put your name up on the wall of shame
And everyday is the same thing
Looking for another way for me to make paper
I think it's time for every single rapper to go to church
Whoever is my opponent you better pray first
They like "Luda why you rapping so fast?"
I'm like "Bitch why you listen too slow?"
I'm the truth in the booth and they can't keep up hardly cause I always hit em with a new flow
And the two door with the coup low with the Hublot off the window with the two low blades from the top like judo listening to bruno on the way to school though getting kudos from a few hoes and they from the choose though
Cuz I'm numero uno and the crew know it's a couple loop holes when it come to fluke hoes cuz some of they pussy bite like Cujo
But back to the you know who
I can't stop till you tell me I'm the greatest
If you need a reminder then put the whole song on repeat and continue to play this
Better turn your stereo louder
Listen up and let me preach
And let's get arrested for disturbing the peace

[Outro][Produced by Swiff D and David Banner]

Huh ha...[Lil Wayne]
Sittin' in a Caddy, Wright like Betty
Floatin' up the aisle like the bride and her Daddy
Hip-hop addict, hip-hop addict
Man I swear I'm on top like the attic
Yeah, bitch, I be with my dog like Shaggy
And we stay clean but we get dirty like Harry
Flyer than blue birds, cardinals and canaries
Fuck we, I'm all about me like Paris
Hilton presidential suite already
I'm richer than Nicole and I'm a Lion like her Daddy
I am hotter than the Sunday after Saturday
I swear I'm a savage like Lil Webbie and Randy
Oscar de la Hoya, box ya like a casket
Or Diego Coralles, nigga keep jabbin'
See, my style it varies, like drugs in an alley
My leather so soft, my paint prettier than Halle
Wittier than comedy, nigga write a parody
But I ain't tellin' jokes... apparently
A parent, yeah my daughter be the twinkle of my eye
You hurt her, you kill me and nigga I ain't 'bout to die
See y'all are at ground, and my daughter is my sky
I swear I look in her face and I just want to break out and fly
Four tears in my face and you ain't never heard me cry
I'm richer than all y'all, I got a bank full of pride

[Hook]
Started out hustlin' (ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (ended up ballin') (x3)
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

[Brisco]
My paint Bubblicious, the motor so vicious
The rims the same color as the wrapper of a Kisses, Hersey's
I'm hyphy, somethin' like a piston
And when I'm in Detroit, I be ballin' like a Piston
Oh, and did I mention, I'm fly like a pigeon
Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin'
I'm nine under par in a Bentley golf cart
The Polo be cream but the Prada's caviar
Weezy I'm sick from all this tourin'
You told me (sip this,) then call me in the morning
And I vowed to never trust another woman
In my life, and then I got horny

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
See I ain't goin' nowhere, bitch
You know a nigga been home, honey
Money fuckin' retarded, call it down syndrome money
My case sick, shit, they diagnose sickle cell bread
The revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed
Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down in Comstock
These bitches call me Bling King, I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas, flawless and D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass
They movin' on a nigga as I'm walkin' the valley, ready?
And zoomin' with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you niggas can't believe
Like purchase persons, places all them things that you can't conceive
Like interactin' with women the caliber of Janet
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet (WHOA!)
I hope you niggas know just what it is
While I'm countin' my paper, niggas know I'm handlin' my biz

[Hook][Hook]
(Ay, who I be?)
Rubberband man, wild as the Taliban
9 in my right, 45 in my other hand
(Ay, Who I'm is?)
Call me "trouble" man
Always in trouble, man!
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevys all colors, man

[Verse 1]
Rubberband man
Like a one-man band
Treat these niggas like the Apollo
And I'm the Sandman
Tote a hundred grand
Cannon in the waistband
Looking for a sweet lick?
Well this is the wrong place, man
7-time felon, what I care about a case, man?
I'm campaigning to bury the hate
So say ya grace, man
Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back
I say it in his face
I'm a thoroughbred nigga
I don't fake and I don't hate
Check my resume, nigga
My record's impeccable
Anywhere in the A nigga
How T.I.P. is highly respectable
And in the M.I.A. nigga
I'm tryna keep it professional
Cause all this tongue rustling
Finna have me snappin, I'm telling you
From the bottom of the Duval
Cakalacky to New York
And everybody showing me love
That's one to you all

Yeah, to all my Florida niggas, my Cakalacky niggas
My LA niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Call me trouble man
Stayed in some trouble man
Some niggas still hating on shawty
But they some suckers, man!
Got a couple fans
That love to do nothing other than
Lick, suck, show 'nuff respect
But still I love 'em, man
Dig it, little pimping got the mind and the muscle
Stay down on his grind
Put the crown on the hustle
Ay, I could show you how to juggle anything
And make it double
Weed, blow, real estate, liquor store
With no trouble
Young Cassius Clay of my day
Marvin Gaye of my time
Tryna stay alive
Living how I say in my rhymes
My cousin used to tell me:
"Take this shit a day at a time"
And told me Friday, died Sunday
Wednesday in the ground
I still smile, cause somehow
I know he seeing me now
And so I'm doing all my shows
Just like he in the crowd

Ay, throw your lighters up for my cousin Toot
Aaliyah, Left Eye and Jam Master Jay

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Grand Hustle man
Mo' hustles than hustle man
"But why the rubber band?"
It representing the struggle man!
My folk gonna trap
Until they come up with another plan
Stack a couple grand
To get theyself off they mama land
Gangsters who been serving
Since you was doing the running man
Went down, did 10
Back round and rich again
That's why I'm young
With the soul of an old man
I'm shell-shocked, get shot
Slow your roll, man
Still ride around
With the Glock on patrol, man
I ain't robbing
I'm just looking for that dro, man
For my niggas slanging blow, pimping hoes
Rollin' vogues, 24s
Let these other niggas know[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
R.I.P. to Mike Brown
Never met Affleck, but I do it for the town
In the Chi where they find bodies in the lost and found
I've been blowing up in London, still smelling like a pound
While Ferguson was looting in the street
Obama was on the treadmill moving in repeat
I'm 21, I ain't had a cosign yet
Like Lamar Odom, they already know I had crack
Shout to Khloe, not Axel Foley
Call the police, your the lames on TV with braids like Lil' Romeo
No limit when I go in, it's a war zone
My troops home, they *brrt* "where you at?" like a boost phone
Y'all mobile, I'm global, we been different
Had a number #1 in the UK, that's a big difference
Not to mention, as a minor I was major
I ain't never get a job, I got my own business
SAVEMONEY

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Good credit, need no cosign
Snow Tha Product got the balls to come in the game
And I won't get no push from no guy
When I need the dough, split no pies
I'm not a cookie cutter bitch, but no shade
But if Snow spit it, Snow write
Oh, by the way you rappers namedrop El Chapo
Migos, Narkos, coppos, cop o's from papos
[?] Griselda Blanco
But I'm not gonna get my shot though?
Cuando a la culture para latina, tu you cacho
Pero mina que esta I'm raised on Pun and the best of 'em
You know I don't like Visas, give an Amex to a Mexican
And ooh, I'm 'bout to represent, ask BET
It's STP, hit your SAP button ASAP
Si porque mira nomas, mira que litica la chica [?}
Corazon de oro, pero con plata [?]
Si pero aqui no mas la que mata, bars, Sabado Gigante
Cause I'll be damned, if the only Latin rep is Joseline Hernandez

[Verse 3: Los]
Yo, I keep these rappers running like roaches when Raid come in
Los is the dopest, please don't provoke him to spray something
I hopped up out the bed as fresh as a Glade plugin
Cause I charged a high fee like the dance in the Bay, cousin
Just exit
Trying to describe me in one word is like if you spell dog, but you dyslexic
They should've kept my cage locked
Where I'm from if he say he tryna shoot that fade he get his fade shot
Hey, Pac, remember shit was poppin'?
You on my list, it was a wrap, I was Christmas shoppin'
I kept a full body cast for a bitch to hop in
Then I full bodied Cass while Swizz was watching
I'm way better whether you may agree
Mayweather pedigree, you make cheddar bet it on me
I get the best of the best dealt with
So when my magazine hit I ain't talking XXL shit
So the whip matte black, the top bent back
Got a chick misguided like a [?] flip
"Hello?" Man, hold that phone
My little homie raw, man, he got both Techs on
He told me to tell you it's a no flex zone
So you ain't making no chuck, nor is he getting his Bo Flex on
He unload that chrome, and send them if you talkie
I give him detail, and he'll pin it on a donkey
King

[Verse 4: Treach]
I put the word out like word out, word is bond, word up
Word is bird, wordie words that I heard
I got a herd of verbs that'll slap [?] after yours
Anything after the fact is an act of war
Bad man and a wicked shotta
Wet you up like an otter, operate like Shabba
Hundred thousands way to hump, choose a telly
I'm rude and black like Ox from Belly
Got shellys to shock your shooters
Bet a bottom dollar I can make thunder clap and make a rottweiler holla
Yeah, rob the rich and eat with the hood, bang
Cause Jersey's back, back top of the food chain
KG was on the scenery
He said "eat the cypher, turn the BET to an eatery"
And here's a true statement
Half of the hip in hip hop needs a hip replacement

[Verse 5: David Banner]
My dream is to be a part of team Elohim
To transcend ten of walks of human beings
Meditate and convo with the all eye seeing
To maybe just hear
Quiet my soul so he shares or It can lighten my load
My soul [?] commode
Defecate [?]
I'm susceptible to the pressure but then I think about Shakir Stewart
I need help from the almighty
To ask why don't we discuss the trials of Chris Lightly
From Ku Klux the Klan who tied Emmett Till to a fan
The same that shot Tray, Zimmerman's hand
They got my stomach to a knot
I'm bent over prayin' to God like it's a lot, it's a lot
Ankles tied to some chain
I wanna say yes, but it's no like Tulane
I mean N.O
Not too many blacks make it to the show; Jay Leno
Went broke in a Bentley, now I'm rich whipping a pinto
I'm stunting like deep dish rims on Hertz rentals
When I was broke I was proud to sell dope to ya old folks house
Nigga, I meant it how it sounds
Where were the white rappers when they mowed Mike Brown down?
Nowhere to be found[Hook]
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Work that, lemme see you drip sweat

I wanna see you cum in the middle of the dance floor
Your nigga can't fuck, what you think your finger made for?
I'mma beat that pussy up
You get it wet enough, and I might lick it up
Lickey, lickey, lickey, like a peppermint swirl
Lick that clit
Cum girl

Take you to the crib, we can fuck til the bed break
Uh,we can fuck until your pussy ache
Think about the type right now, girl, mastur (Uh uh) bate for a nigga

It's me in your world
Work that clit
Cum girl

[Hook]

Cum when you're feeling good, lick it all off
Catch it in your mouth, like your last name Moss
Play with the nitty girl, stick it on in
I'm feeling real freaky girl, bring your friends
I'm 'bout to knock 'em down like 1, 2, 3
It ain't nothin' to a pimp, girl, play with the g-spot
Make it hot, gon on, get your girl, Sheryl
Bring your clique
Cum girl
And I'mma make 'em all cum
Beat it like Mr. Collipark on the drums
I'mma beat it like Mike when he fucked Billie Jean
Work it, work it, work it, til you make that pussy cream

[Hook]

Bend it on over, lemme see it from the back
Work your thumb in it girl, I love it like that
Freaky ass hoes love freaky ass men

Open up wide, lemme show you what's it made for
Uh, work your finger like a donkey

I'mma put some dick in your world
Work that clit
Cum girl

[Hook]

Work that clit
Cum girl[Verse 1: Skipp Coon]
See all I gotta be is what Jack said I was so
I don't give a bee about no buzz
I am about freedom
I never mind the chickens or the club
I will live and die for the cause just because
If I don't I wonder who will
Ya'll place value on your wheels and your automobiles
But never acknowledge your children's diminishing skills
Or that they continue to fill all the prisons they build
My life is all God gave me to give
I want us to be free, but you would really rather I chill
While the blood of the slaughtered is watering killing fields
You jiving and shucking. She stripping and sucking for the bills
All for the love of the bread cheese dough. Sell pills weed blow
Let pistols go. Got coke from the countras, gave crack to the po'
And the government responds to it: "Just say no"
I'm freedom fighting for the love, you selling out on the low
And a man ain't fit to live without something he'd die for
I'm in the truck with a rifle like I'm Lee Malvo
Ya'll want a Sambo, well I'm Skipp Rambo
Jordans and camo, white tees and ammo
Put the freedom in the kick snare and the sample
I am Rambo
Put the freedom in the kick snare and the sample

[Verse 2: David Banner]
Fuck it then I'm Shaft don't have no ammo
No spook. I don't sit, I'll kick in your front door
Malcolm with a K or Medgar with four fours
There was bodies severed but we don't know what we're fighting for
Five and the six we bang on the wrong thing
Let's fight against the people that came and names change
Transatlantic trips that led to bodies hanging from a tree
It's cool to ship a Ki
You won't fight against the system but you're worried 'bout me
And who I won't sign. But you gonna find
That they gon' put it in a chip and embed it in your mind
And all off in your spine. Confederate flags
I'm bitching because that bitch still flying
I would give you the answer but we're running out of time
(Kids still dying)

[Verse 3: Luca Brazi]
See they don't want to listen so loud what I got to be
Cause my people are proud of the poverty
That got they sons shooting guns over dollar bills
He getting money snow or sunny
But his daughter still read at a first grade level
And she eleven years old and her nose held high to the sky
Cause she got her first purse made, yes on her birthday
She was singing birthday sex
Let's skim right over what's showing in plain sight
Looking the other way but knowing it ain't right
Like over 50 shots now Sean Bell gone
Or a flash bang thrown in a little girl's home
Aiyana Jones. Who? Aiyana Jones
One shot to the dome she was seven years old
It's a shame
Imagine being daddy one day to putting your baby girl in the grave
Something need to change
This ain't a game
If you playing to the mayhem you be slaving to the day you laying face up in a casket
With credit card sharks still asking if they can put your name on some plastic
Man there's a war going on outside no one is safe from
Heavy is the dark, a spark Imma create one
Cause a little light might be enough to make some stray from the ways of the slave
The pain and the hunger is enough to make a sane man put it to your brain for some money and a chain
And I don't really blame 'em cause if you in the game screaming money ain't a thing
You resemble a filet
A lot of people saying that I'm preaching to the deaf
Man give that shit a rest. I'm going till the breath
Won't come out a nigga chest. They in it for the checks
I'm in it cause I want to be remembered as a vet
Luc Brazi[Hook x2: Akon]
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tool on deck, why would I lie?
Nigga you a pussy, hope you got 9 lives
I can hit a nigga with the 9, 9 times
Country ass boy, country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil Weezyana
Everybody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill poppin' animal, syrup sippin' nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fucking antenna
You fucking with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The 9 give me brains but the AK add liver
The rapper is insane flowing like a mad river
Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho, hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her?
Her name is 9 millimeter

[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Banner]
If I got 9 slugs, 9 bullets gone fly
If I got a red beam, 9 people gone die
9 mamas gone cry, 9 spirits in the sky
9 preachers preaching, 9 sermons telling 9 lies
Cause each and every one of y'all 9 niggas wasn't shit
I would have rather kept the 9 rugers in the ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the 9 let 9 spit
I lick em all like eighteen tits on 9 chicks
I'm a suicide risk, 9 slits on each wrist
If I die 9 times the next go-arounds a bitch
And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows
And shove 9 inches of dick in 99 hoes

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a west coast original, black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang
You better stop that, mang
Fat mouth to Dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm killing like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah, I'm a killa, I ain't here to lock up
I flash the heater, then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggas always acting hard
I keep a 9 millimeter in my waist and got 2 more in the car
Yeah you're all about to get it so quit it, tryin' to conceal it
You'll fuck around and make me reveal it, so killas kill it

‘Cause I be going HAM, I be going crazy
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby
They go oh and tell me I'm amazing
They go oh and tell me I'm amazing, oh

[Verse 1: David Banner]
She said she headed my way, pronto
Come up to the penthouse suite, condo
She only come over to get beat, bongo
Come tonight, stay until the morning, Alonzo
She said she tryna come, can I assist? Rondo
Headed to the bedroom? Nah, follow
She like a wack rapper, no spit, swallow
She told me I'm the best and I respond, “Yeah I know," that’s sort of like my motto
See it in her eye a little fear, Madam
Hop up in my push-back seat, Phantom
It only happens for a small few, no random
Now let me shoot it in your Mariah, Cannon

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chris Brown x2]
Hey lil mama, won’t ya freak some?
You and your girlfriend together, that’s a threesome
You're my sex slave, don’t want your freedom
We do it over and over, here we come

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Come over here baby
Hop up in my sweet front seat, Mercedes
I know that you had couple drinks, faded
Said she feeling good, let me, make it
Better than it was so what you think, later?
You could meet me at my hotel suite, naked
She was like, "Nah," I'm like, "Better take it"
So used to being regular, she don't understand a man ten steps ahead of her
Yeah, I can change your decimal
I'm your lottery ticket, have you scratching like eczema
She seeing lights like casinos
And I'm asking, "What ya all up on me for?" Cause we go

[Chorus]

[Outro: David Banner]
She only come over to get beat, bongo[Hook x2: Jodeci sample]
Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives?
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Banner when you coming back? Tell me when I ever left?
I got two tatted on my spine you on my mind in every breath
Have I ever went on TV and not call your fucking name?
Yeah I slept with other dames, but my love for you don't change
Give a fuck what haters say, bitch go drink some Gatorade
Bitch I get that money too, never wood all in your face
But when I'm gone I'm gettin' cash, while them niggas on they ass
Fat as fuck fallin' off while I keep my foot all on the gas
Keepin' my hand all up on the grain
God on my heart, money on my brain
I got a little money but my heart didn't change
I bet a mothafucka gon respect your name
Don't smoke that much, ain't on that dust
Keep some hen all in my cup
Take my fingers twist them fucks
Say your name and throw it up

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
You always on my mind when I'm on the road
Doing shows, puttin' it down
For me and you, I remain true
And represent till' I'm underground
You do the same just as I would change
Hold your curb while the caddy swang
On them fuck niggas that ain't fuck with ya'
Cuz of your past, until I came in yo life
I ain't ashamed to call you my wife
All these other hoes been' trife
Ain't no secret I be creepin', but I dedicate my life
To your warm embrace, skin as soft as that red clay
Heart beat like a 808, in my old school when I blast the bass
Rep this here all in they face
Proudly say you in a southern state, of mind
Ain't no other worth my time
And when I set ya' out, you shine
For the world to see that you was meant for me
And I love you so
Mississippi I'm foreva with ya' through thick and thin
I just need to know, do ya'...

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Why they wanna talk about us?
They ain't never really gave a fuck about love
They ain't never really gave a fuck about you
A fuck about me, the S to I-P
The J to A-C
The D to A-V-I-D, B-A double N-E-R
Rolling up 55 like a split cigar
All of my folks yellin' out "You can't make it nigga"
I did though for my kin folks
You can't crush my heart its been broke
In your river I been soaked
When I hear your name it gives hope
Don't smoke that much, ain't on that dust
Keep some hen all in my cup
Take my fingers twist them fucks
Say your name and throw it up
(Scratches) Yeah

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
R.I.P. to Mike Brown
Never met Affleck, but I do it for the town
In the Chi where they find bodies in the lost and found
I've been blowing up in London, still smelling like a pound
While Ferguson was looting in the street
Obama was on the treadmill moving in repeat
I'm 21, I ain't had a cosign yet
Like Lamar Odom, they already know I had crack
Shout to Khloe, not Axel Foley
Call the police, your the lames on TV with braids like Lil' Romeo
No limit when I go in, it's a war zone
My troops home, they *brrt* "where you at?" like a boost phone
Y'all mobile, I'm global, we been different
Had a number #1 in the UK, that's a big difference
Not to mention, as a minor I was major
I ain't never get a job, I got my own business
SAVEMONEY

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Good credit, need no cosign
Snow Tha Product got the balls to come in the game
And I won't get no push from no guy
When I need the dough, split no pies
I'm not a cookie cutter bitch, but no shade
But if Snow spit it, Snow write
Oh, by the way you rappers namedrop El Chapo
Migos, Narkos, coppos, cop o's from papos
[?] Griselda Blanco
But I'm not gonna get my shot though?
Cuando a la culture para latina, tu you cacho
Pero mina que esta I'm raised on Pun and the best of 'em
You know I don't like Visas, give an Amex to a Mexican
And ooh, I'm 'bout to represent, ask BET
It's STP, hit your SAP button ASAP
Si porque mira nomas, mira que litica la chica [?}
Corazon de oro, pero con plata [?]
Si pero aqui no mas la que mata, bars, Sabado Gigante
Cause I'll be damned, if the only Latin rep is Joseline Hernandez

[Verse 3: Los]
Yo, I keep these rappers running like roaches when Raid come in
Los is the dopest, please don't provoke him to spray something
I hopped up out the bed as fresh as a Glade plugin
Cause I charged a high fee like the dance in the Bay, cousin
Just exit
Trying to describe me in one word is like if you spell dog, but you dyslexic
They should've kept my cage locked
Where I'm from if he say he tryna shoot that fade he get his fade shot
Hey, Pac, remember shit was poppin'?
You on my list, it was a wrap, I was Christmas shoppin'
I kept a full body cast for a bitch to hop in
Then I full bodied Cass while Swizz was watching
I'm way better whether you may agree
Mayweather pedigree, you make cheddar bet it on me
I get the best of the best dealt with
So when my magazine hit I ain't talking XXL shit
So the whip matte black, the top bent back
Got a chick misguided like a [?] flip
"Hello?" Man, hold that phone
My little homie raw, man, he got both Techs on
He told me to tell you it's a no flex zone
So you ain't making no chuck, nor is he getting his Bo Flex on
He unload that chrome, and send them if you talkie
I give him detail, and he'll pin it on a donkey
King

[Verse 4: Treach]
I put the word out like word out, word is bond, word up
Word is bird, wordie words that I heard
I got a herd of verbs that'll slap [?] after yours
Anything after the fact is an act of war
Bad man and a wicked shotta
Wet you up like an otter, operate like Shabba
Hundred thousands way to hump, choose a telly
I'm rude and black like Ox from Belly
Got shellys to shock your shooters
Bet a bottom dollar I can make thunder clap and make a rottweiler holla
Yeah, rob the rich and eat with the hood, bang
Cause Jersey's back, back top of the food chain
KG was on the scenery
He said "eat the cypher, turn the BET to an eatery"
And here's a true statement
Half of the hip in hip hop needs a hip replacement

[Verse 5: David Banner]
My dream is to be a part of team Elohim
To transcend ten of walks of human beings
Meditate and convo with the all eye seeing
To maybe just hear
Quiet my soul so he shares or It can lighten my load
My soul [?] commode
Defecate [?]
I'm susceptible to the pressure but then I think about Shakir Stewart
I need help from the almighty
To ask why don't we discuss the trials of Chris Lightly
From Ku Klux the Klan who tied Emmett Till to a fan
The same that shot Tray, Zimmerman's hand
They got my stomach to a knot
I'm bent over prayin' to God like it's a lot, it's a lot
Ankles tied to some chain
I wanna say yes, but it's no like Tulane
I mean N.O
Not too many blacks make it to the show; Jay Leno
Went broke in a Bentley, now I'm rich whipping a pinto
I'm stunting like deep dish rims on Hertz rentals
When I was broke I was proud to sell dope to ya old folks house
Nigga, I meant it how it sounds
Where were the white rappers when they mowed Mike Brown down?
Nowhere to be foundMy dream is to be part of team Elohim

To transcend sin, the wonts of human beings

To meditate then convo with all eye seeing

Or maybe just hear

Quiet my soul so he, she, or it can lighten my load

My soul corrodes

To mouth is a commode

Defecate some shit that y'all should hear

I'm susceptible to depression but then I think about Shakir Stewart

I need help from the Almighty

To ask why we don't discuss the trials of Chris Lighty

From Ku Klux the Klan who tied Emmett Till to a fan

The same that shot Tray, Zimmerman and

They got my stomach in knot

I'm bent over praying to God like its salat, its a lot

Ankles tied to some chains

I want to say yes but its no like Tulane

I meant N.O

Not many blacks make it to the show Jay Leno

Went broke in a Bentley now i'm rich whippin' a Pinto;

I'm stuntin' like deep dish rims on Hertz rentals

When I was broke I'd be proud to sell dope to your own folks house, nigga

I meant it how it sounds

Where were all the white rappers when they mowed Mike Brown down

No where to be found[Intro: David Banner]
Ha Ha! Let's do it!

[Marsha Ambrosius] (David Banner)

Three for all the ladies that's standin outside my do'

Then walk to the bus with a pimp's velocity
Then open up my hand and say y'all all can come with me

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Two: David banner]
I got a bar on the bus we could discuss future plans
Me and you and all your friends we could visit foreign lands
Like showers in Okinawa, barefoot in Thailand
Or we could sop up some biscuits and syrup with bare hands
That's back in Mississippi
All you gotta do is close yo' eyes and come with me girl

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Three: Ludacris]
LUDA!!! I told her, I got the chips if you got the dip
She said when I dip then I better be equipped when you keep my hand on her hips
I told her gimme all you got until your givin is gone
She said her love's eternal and I won't be livin that long
Well! I'm not immortal and I swear I'm no wimp
Cause I died twice and keep comin back as a pimp

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Four: David Banner]
Too close for comfort too close for home
You too close to the front of the stage to be alone
Here's my number when I'm gone you can call me on the phone
I don't buy you bein shy you supposed to be grown
This is more than a pass Hail Mary's bein throwned
Line four up on the line and head to the end zone girl

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Five: Ludacris]
Now put your hands up in the air yeah put 'em where I could see 'em

Hallelujah!!! Please pass the offerin
You so wet that I be comin up for oxygen

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius] (Ludacris)
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!! (Don't worry baby I can swim)

[Verse Six: David Banner]
Those huge baby eyes, keep runnin off at the mouth
And they tellin me, how you love these rappers from the South
And I was thinkin how splendid I just wish that your girl wasn't so long winded
We could go to Planet 'Lac
Where the land is made of leather you could lay off on your back
When the clouds are made of tint so you know it stays black, girl!

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Seven: Ludacris]
Look! I was one of the best guys (What) Not one of your ex guys (What)
If you get drunk don't worry I'll let my sex drive
I keep my hands on the wheel if you put it in reverse
Buckle your safety belt, or I'll put you in a hearse
Your frame will strain eyes to women the same size (OH!)
You so fine I'm 'bout to put you in my Fave Five

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!![David Banner]
Mama ain't got no cash, daddy ain't got no doe
So daddy went to my mama and started pimpin that ho
Man it's hard times, niggas ain't got shit
Nothin but billy clubs to they head and they ass kicked
Heroin in they vein, cocaine up in they brain
Man what you expect, America gave us pain
So fuck it, now we thugs, ??? mean drugs
And takin mean mugs, and fill 'em with those slugs
I gave up fake gods, and Jesus don't look like us
Why y'all think we gon' kill and just don't give a hot fuck
Devil that's how you made us, hiatus up in the pen
Man we came out blind, that's why we goin back in
But God, I'mma teach 'em, reach 'em up in these streets
Bush, I'm runnin' up in this shit like a track meet
You murdered, up in Texas where killin' is such a sin
The first month you in office you started killin' again
But shit, we just some niggas and that's how the game go
Y'all took us up out the state moved us straight out to Death Row
Y'all may of, made us slaves but never make us your ho
God, you my pimp so let's start exposin' these hoes
Y'all judges some weak pussies, y'all preaches some rapin' fags
These people that made us slaves, these niggas wavin' they flags
America ain't shit but home of the hot lick
They hang us all by rope, then laugh and cut off our dick

[Hook]
Have y'all niggas ever thought about
All the things we been talkin' bout
Down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi
Have y'all niggas ever thought about
All the things we been talkin' bout
Down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi
Have y'all niggas ever thought about
All the things we been talkin' bout
Down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi[Intro]
It's gon be aight though
This one's for you, yeah
Cadillac's on 22s
Pimp my voice and mack these beats
Pray to the to the Lord for these Mississippi streets

[Refrain x2]
Cadillac's on 22s
I ain't did nothing in my life but stayed true
Pimp my voice and mack these beats
Pray to the Lord for these Mississippi streets

[Verse 1]
God I know that we pimp, God I know that we wrong
God I know I should talk about more in all my songs
I know these kids are listening, I know I'm here for a mission
But it's so hard to get em when 22" rims are glistening
I know these walls are talking, Lord I want to do right
I tried to fight but these demons they come to me at night
Like my Momma, my Daddy, my girl and all my boys
I lost Michelle but I guess I still got Dwayne and Roy
My cousin Sweets, Mama Lena and Jason
Lord I'm praying for SWAC, my heart is steady pacing
Keep him off them drugs, far away from thugs
He's still my hero but just a shell, man of what he was
Yeah smoke and get a buzz, but God I hear you calling
And shit wrong with balling, but my soul is just steady falling
In to sex and the debt, into an Earthly jail
God I'm stacking my mail but will I end up in hell

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Lord they hung Andre Jones
Lord they hung Raynard Johnson
Lord I want to fight back but I'm just so sick of bouncing
Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord please just tell me something
My folks still dumping my music bumping but I feel nothing
My heart is steady pumping, my heart is steady breaking
Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man I'm so sick of taking
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
Maybe Earth is hell and just a place for us to learn
Bout your love, your will and grace
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place
Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park
So we can come home this world right here feeling so dark
It's feeling so cold, Lord I'm getting so old
I don't if I can take this world right here no more
22 inch rims on the 'Lac
I guess that was your footprint in the sand carrying us on your back

[Refrain][Intro: Kree]
In californication

[Verse 1: David Banner & (Snoop Dogg)]
Yeah, bitch I'm from the country but that don’t make a nigga soft
Big city niggas come south and get their wigs knocked off
Dare me, I just hustle and flow
Find a track, start and pimp on a ho
The block got hot, a nigga had to get low
Get the fuck out of dodge and hit my uncle on the west side
Trevon (Whattup neph? What's cracking?)
I wanna visit L.A., I'm already packed
Been already stacking so we gonna get turned up
(Soon as you land, purple kush gonna get burnt up)
Shit, the next day I'm at LAX
Uncle Trey pulled up in a Camaro SS
Black on black, sitting on 23s
Bumping Rich Boy like bitch Throw Some D's
2 bad bitches in the back seat, one of them for me
Mexican mami named Marie
Rolling up some trees on the 105 east
Roll down the window, just to feel the breeze
It's real nice, feeling like paradise (sheesh)
And all I can see is sunshine and palm trees

[Hook: Kree]
Welcome to californication
Welcome to californication

[Verse 2: David Banner & (Snoop Dogg)]
Where we going? (To the hood) naw I wanna see the swap meet
Crenshaw and Slauson (Fool, that's where the cops be)
(Nigga, I ain't got no driver's license or insurance)
Sure enough the cops put us over on Torrance
Everybody out the car, the cops set us on the curve
They searched the ashtray and found a roach full of herbs
What's this in that cigar? (Medical marijuana officer)
(I got a weed card) What condition you smoke weed for?
Trevon Jones, place your hands behind your back
You're under arrest for warrants go to court in Torrance Monday
Monday? It's Wednesday man
Or maybe Tuesday {that's some bullshit} you heard me ma’am
Now if you keep it up, I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice
Trey like "take the car, fuck this"
(Have fun, call my homies, go clubbing with your dumb ass)
(At least they ain't found my gun stash)

[Hook: Kree]
Welcome to californication, you might come for vacation
Welcome to californication
But you might leave on probation, I'm telling you that
Welcome to californication, everyone knows, anything goes
Welcome to californication, in californication

[Verse 3: David Banner, (Nipsey Hussle), {Ras Kass} & Snoop Dogg]
I dropped the bitches off, now I'm off to my uncle house
Stopped by the liquor store, nothing but the thugs out
White tees and Chucks when nigga hit me up like
{Ay ay ay, where you from homie?} Lifted up his shirt on me
Chrome 4-5, and dawg I wasn't strapped
And another walked up like (Nah, he cool, that's Dave Black)
(Trey lo folks, visiting from Mississippi)
Passed the pint of Hennesey, (here sip this with me)
I'm Javon, we're gonna get it popping tonight
Wassup (Hollywood around here, these niggas are flocking at night)
What's flocking? (Breaking in homes, B and E)
(Burglary nigga, damn you slow)
Oh, we kicked it in the hood drinking smoking kush twist up
Hood rat with the big butt shows up got our dicks up
Kissed my auntie on the cheek see you later
Now we 5 niggas deep in Javon's Navigator
The club's off the chain, I'm seeing models and stars
NBA players straight buying out bars
The state of Arizona tryna segragate
But my dick don't discriminate
Black girls, white girls, pimping I just like girls
California Girls, Katy Perry dyke girls
Met an Asian with fake tits next to a hype girl
She took a pot of that, sniffing on that white girl
VIP bottles and all that
Then some random nigga started pouring out cognac
I said Pimpin what you doin’? He said fuck you too
And that’s the last thing he did
I took a bottle and I cracked that nigga, smacked that nigga
Security rushed me like arrest that nigga
Tearing up the club, all 5 of us
Asian bitch grab me like hurry up slide with us
But the cops were outside stopped her, detained me
Found some coke in her purse, motherfuckers blame me
Next thing you know I'm in the county jail
I walked in the cell, my uncle Tray is right there
And he's just shaking his head then he laughed at a nigga
Don't pee in the bed
Don't let the bright lights fool ya, LA a trippy place
It's been 24 hours I just caught my first case, damn

[Bridge: Kree]
I’m just here to see the Hollywood sign get locked up
Niggas doin’ crazy, tribe lights get popped up
As they tripping on me for no reason
Jail politics, county niggas in season

[Hook: Kree]
Welcome to californication, you might come for vacation
Welcome to californication, you might leave on probation

It’s Brooklyn in the house

[Hook] ×2

[Verse 2: Maino]

Shout out to my Brooklyn bros and addicted to that Louis Vuitton
No one how to grind hit the mall with them credit cards
Diamonds in my audemar, back the back the corner store
Bitch we let em fight before we fuck, I swear to God

Never change, I got love for my down girls
That did it all for the heights on Groundsville
Fuck em all my Brooklyn chick with a clown still
Still rolling non-stop like it’s down hill
Yeah nigga take my Brooklyn chick everywhere

Took me to junior’s in the business for my birthday

[Hook] ×2

[Verse 3: David Banner]

Flyin’ on the interstate, always in and out of state
Jay bought the Nets and I ain't talking 'bout Leno
The crib that I bought in the borough is not a rental

Remix!
E! E!

[Verse 1: J-Doe]
Since this the remix, remix
I'mma have to do it Like it's never been done
I'mma have to kill it like it's never been one
Niggas that was spittin didn't get enough attention
Like, I do and I move it however the fuck I want to and
Niggas try to stop me, try to block me
Then I'm probably gonna give it to em quicker
Than a Kawasaki. Moving top speed - ow!
I'm Chris Brown: nigga, look at me now
Came from the muthafuckin bottom to the top
Now I rain on them niggas that was hating on the block
I'm the same lil nigga, that was tryna get a drop
Now the Range got the bitches goin crazy as fuck
Like "Ow look at that nigga J-Doe
Sing that song coke, dope" LEGGO

[Hook]
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas already know what I be doing when I
Be getting on these records and be fucking up
Everything, I be bruckin up everything
And be shutting up everything and every other nigga dead
The way I come and I kill and I give em CRACK
And then I make em DUMB, hit em with the BAP
And then I make a nigga run, then I give em drugs
Kill another track, yeah I know, yeah I know, it ain't fair
Alright, alright, I'mma chill
Fuck that I lied bitch! B-b-b-busta bout to
D-d-d-d-do it and y-y-ya know that I'm b-b-b-back
They say that I'm the nicest and I'm hoping you know it's the fact
That nigga flow priceless!
Them niggas don't know how to act, whenever I get up on the beat
You know I'm coming for your food, because you know I gotta eat
And it ain't nothing you can do because I'm running through the street
And when I step up in the building, know I'm coming with the heat
Cause I got that:

[Hook]
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
E! E! E! E! X2

[David Banner]
Dope like riding on I-10
95 dope, blowing kush in the wind
With a cup full of Gin
Your bitch and her friend, You only see her top
Over here on my bed. Slap it in her face you know what I'm talking about
Pacquiao on the pussy I'mma knock it out
Wanna get through nigga, we could swap it out
Talk shit, get a cock blocked in your mouth
I admit that yo Bitch a dime, but I'm all in her mouth like a braces line
The girl love the way that the dick go down
*Car Beep* That's her, I'mma dick her now
I go to ya spot, ha-hard as a rock
Walk in homeboy I got a key, I never knock
She called me Uncle Luke cause I make her pussy pop
You stay in the trap but I live in her mouth..

[Hook]
"Coke, dope, crack, smack!"
E! E! E! E! X2

[T Pain]
Aye gimme that coke/dope/crack/smack
Put the dick on the track and I hit it from the back
And all the muthafuckas acting like they don't know how to act
Until I pull up in the Cadillac, sharp with a Mac in my lap- laugh at that
Ain't too much funny, yes I'm gettin to the money
Bitch and if a nigga want it, then I guess a nigga running
I can show how I be running shit
And niggas know I'm on that shit
3 or 4 of them ladies up in my hummer shit
(Coke Coke Coke) now go (Coke Coke dope dope)
Is he fuckin with T-Pizzle Nope, nope, nope, nope
Never drop the ball like its soap on a rope
Niggas can't cope so they take another toke
Somebody better come and tell these muthafuckas that
I never gave a fuck about a jealous muthafucka
But if somebody smell a muthafuckin rat, then
Go and tell his ass Teddy Pizzle be spittin that

[Hook][Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ay, what it is, the king back in the buildin'
Still stackin' and buildin', you still rappin' to children
Jeopardizin' your deals, caught up buyin' your wheels
Like its back when we was little and its still time to kill
Quit displayin' your skills, way underpayin' bills
Spend a day in the Ville, on how you saying you real
Niggas could never live how I live, you ain't deservin'
My lifestyle's urban, never met me in person
Just my bread suburban, in a red suburban
On 24's, 20 hoes giving head, I'm swervin'
Fuck boys pissed they pants, scared nervous
I'm shell-shocked, black eye, like I been in the service
Clean, cut, and preserved, but I told George Gervin
The closest thing your ho seen, in picture perfect
The rolls gold king, my ring tight as a virgin (???)
The dream I stop 'fore I seen the top (nigga)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I treat the beats like the streets, on em I do what I want to
I ain't gotta confront you, I'll kill if I want to
Roam amongst monsters, kill homes and front you
That lil nigga swearin' he bad, eat him for lunch too
Fuck you niggas, Dominique slam dunk you
Niggas sucka punch down one of you niggas
I was being nice at first, now I'm runnin' through niggas
Whole crews, not just one or two niggas
Cuz you ain't representin' the south, you just embarassin'
See you on t.v. in New York, them niggas laughin'
The reason why D.J.'s ain't have a clue I was fabulous
Now days not playin' my record well, hell its hazardous
All this cussin' for some loud discussions, outta my character
Bussin' these niggas melons, and threatenin' all of they managers
P.$.C.'s Atlanta, so how you playin' and handlin'
Gorillas with bananas without playin' and banishin'
King of the south, it was said once then
Took a while to comprehend, that all sunk in
On the low deal a mil, I ain't done come again
Room dead, scene fled, 'fore the feds runnin' in

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Comin' live from the Terra-Dome
Shinin' lights on niggas who got they skirts on tight with mascara on
All I have ever known, is 28 in the zone
Gimme a day and its gone, a brick of yeh and its on
You have neva known, me to run
'Less I'm gunnin' at niggas domes
And runnin' them out they own
Territory, every story gotta flipside to it
And your disc ain't shit unless the click ride to it
And I'mma show you how the Westside do it
In the A, not Cali, bank heads, (???) valley
Every crack and every alley sellin' crack
And every time diggin' hairier
Every Kim, Sue, Sally, til I tally up
A big enough knot to buy me a yacht
So then my pistols and my partnas really all that I got
I'm not, playin' at all, I'm sprayin' 'em all
This K'll chop 'em down to size, cuz they say that I'm small man
Pussycats can't worry the dog
Keep throwin' stones at the throne, I'mma bury you all man
Know, you faggot niggas hate that I'm ballin'
Makin' 30k a day and blow it all at the mall, and man I
Can't relate to what you rap on stage, nigga
Cuz I been sellin' yeh since I was Bow Wow's age nigga
Hear my daddy and my cousin talkin' to me from the grave
And all they say is "Young nigga get paid!"

[Hook] - 2X[Verse 1]
Leggo, where the bar at? Tell me where the bar at
'Bout to buy the whole club, where my credit card at?
Money flying in the air, look at what I started
Asses clapping up in here, damn it's like an audience
And she bringing all her friends, I'll be your sea-saw
She about to act an ass, hee haw
Got a stupid monkey, fatter then King Kong
It's like a pistol on you, take it all off
You gon' need an ambulance
After you get done with this hammer in my pants
Make it stand up, watch it dance
All mouth, no hands

[Chorus]
I try to told you niggas, I'm the greatest
You bitch made, haters
Shoes crocodile, fuck 'gators
Ain't no need to talk, nigga pay us
I'm 'bout to go, go, go loco
Go, go, my nigga just crazy
Go, go I'm 'bout to go loco
Go, go that nigga just crazy

[Verse 2]
Look, oh damn my liver, damn I got the shivers
My family got that bomb weed, but all I need is liquor
And then she got that butt, thicker than a Snickers
And shawty got that fire, so I popped her like a blister, ew
I know you think I'm losing it, but why you speed balling?
Nigga I am cruising, bitch, nigga we balling
And when my tattoos come to life
Hoes in your head, out of mind, out of sight
That's why they call me Breezy, baby, cold as ice
Boy don't you make me paint a portrait, rearrange your life
All my kicks fly, they Power Ranger Nikes
I'm the shit nigga, ain't gotta say it twice
Tony the tiger, call me Tony
Cause everything's is great, way she twerking it on me
Boy I ain't no kin to ya, I am from Virginia
804 nigga let go, man they can't get rid of us

[Chorus][VERSE]
I'm feeling something in the air
But they know where they can find us
I see a circle full of squares
They letting anybody sign up
I say subliminals ya best bet
It ain't ya destiny to say my name
So pump ya brakes before the car wrecks
And your supporters probably feel the same
Always ready cause them 'Ville niggas trained to go
And when I see a problem I'mma always take the same approach
Learn to hustle before another nigga show the ropes
And I'mma chase this paper before I see my niggas going broke
Stay 100 cause the city don't respect a joke
And "this ain't what they want"
That's some shit I'm bout to make a quote
Who the realest?
Bet these niggas wouldn't get a vote
And you ain't gotta wipe me down
I'mma let it soak
Got this bitch locked
I run shit without shoes on
Plenty niggas done took shots
So my shit list got too long
Nigga rope up
Then jump off
They sharks all through this water
They talk hard, but they heart soft
So real niggas place that order
Bitch this that authentic
That's 10 toes, so I'm all in it
We bi-winning, no Sheen thou
Took it over night like repo
Got a mind state like Nino
Skin tone like G- Money
Bad hoes still on the clock
And they legs open like 8:20, uh

[HOOK]
Cross my heart and I hope to fly
Never coming down
So niggas never come around
(repeat)
Recognize, 'fore I make it clear
Gotta a problem we can take it there
Niggas betta know that this the year
I predicated 2012
And now it's finally here

I'm feeling something in the air
Niggas finally see they time up
See I could never be compared
I'm at a height you couldn't climb up
Ain't in my city but I rep hard
I'm still living like I'm carefree
And I ain't never had a pulled card
Cause ain't a nigga ever scared me

[HOOK]
Recognize, 'fore I take it there
Gotta a problem, nigga make it clear
Niggas betta know that this the year
I predicated 2012
And now it's finally here[Intro]

Point her out, where she at?

System cranked, blaze'on

Got three chicks rollin' out black, white and Asian
Another one pigeon tellin me to come home
He jus left the house and he ain't comin back home
I use the V-12 powers, I be there in an hour
Matter fact, you keep the door open I'll catch you in the shower
Bring it back over girl, I hear you gettin' louder
And the same shit gon' happen  if you use the word ours yeah!

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Verse 3]
We runnin' through a whole pound - of that sticky
Hydro got my whole mouth - feelin' icky
I pour Crissy down a ho's mouth - just cause she picked me
Back stage when my show's out - tell em what you mean
I mean four inches when we roll out - come and get me
Rock the platinum and brought the gold out - who all wit' me?
I already got my fo' out - cocked
Plus I got many niggas wanna show out!
In the Escalade
(you know) Powder baby blue leather seats Gucci
And Jack Frosty
Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
Go back like there no socks in rugby
If you compare me to any other MC on originality
For s'all in the jewelry

If you ready to leave Holly, see you in Maui

[Hook]

Eh! eh! eh! (oh oooh!) eh! eh! eh! eh!

And that's alright, that's alright
Raised in the gutter, I'm a find a way
Everything is ok
Baby lift your cup up
Enjoy the night, enjoy the night

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Amsterdam to Tokyo longitude only I can know
Latitude is my attitude fall in place like a domino
I ain't come here to make no friends
Because I rather be feared than love
Scared to death that I move this mountain get to you with this shotgun slug
And I could never turn my back on the ways of life
I'm sparing no expense top down Vegas lights
My flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck
It's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up
Is filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met
And they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit
Let's see how fucked up we all gon' get

[Hook: Brevi]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Raised in the gutter bread getting butter
Face like her mother ass like she's southern
So much cash I just gotta laugh
Out in Paris smoking grass signing autographs
It's apparent if it's foreign and I'm starring
If it's shining then I'm near it
It's designer then I wear it, uh
Look at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance
You too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance
You know me bitch I get straight down to the point
Pop another bottle roll another joint
And all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG
I'm way too high to be low key
Better act like you know me

[Hook: Brevi]

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Girl if you wanna get some drunk dick you can come and get it from me
I know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this hennessey
But we gon' get fucked up then pour it up drink big
Party like it's 99 put a one-nine before that bitch
We gon' sip until we get sick, we gon' blaze till we get licked
Call Earl the world spinning tell the lil' bitch ye we winning
The girl that you love is good in the beginning
Two good shots and now the girl sinnin'
Spinning over now I'm sober face breasts
More Mer'
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit let's see how fucked up we all gon' get

[Hook: Brevi][Verse]
They gave us Obama like
It was gonna stop the fight
Like it was gonna stop the cause
Folks still scraping
Trying to find them some socks and drawers
And something to eat
The IRS is coming so I'm back on these beats
Barack pushed hope
Reagan pushed dope
Clinton pushed something down a young gal's throat
Yah, and since we talking about throats
White folks, what you know about ropes?
Yah, what you know about trees
And men swinging from them that look like me?
How you say that don't affect us?
Tuskegee, how you let them infect us?
It's fear of the black semen
Putting sage on a page to eradicate these demons
This for Tulsa, Oklahoma, this for Rosewood
This for Philly when the cops bombed the whole hood
This for Harlem when the pigs stop and frisk
All my folks from the Congo tell Belgium suck a, suck a
Boy wonder? Nope, meant Dick Grayson
I'm essential like the Moors were to the Masons
The kush (AFRICA), the black push
Aborigines I love you, take back the bush
Oh, we are back on presidents
George was so irrelevant
But he did send the country to hell
And a lot of black folks to jail
If we are blind, that's fine, I'll spit it in braille
Drop an F-bomb in cursive, put that whore in the mail
P.O.s (POST OFFICES) they are about to shut down
I was on my way to heaven then I stopped and turned around
The government, yes, it did shut down
I was on my way to heaven but I stopped and turned around for my people
I'll try to never leave you
This is a war against evil
Knievil

[Outro: Ernestine Johnson]
Lifetime of pain
You can't wash away these stains
You can't soak me in a tub full of bleach
And brighten the shadows you left on my past
Or whiten those dark stones you placed on my path
Where is the love?
Mentally institutionalized by a nation plotting our demise
Sicknesses is created for our numbers to be cut
Love is like you're staring at us with your eyes wide shut
Love? What love? Where are you?[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Say bitch I do it
A million dollar stacking loud packing
Man my weed and pockets matching
What is you asking, shut the fuck up
I’m talking in the real nigga accent man
And all these hoes attracted to the fucking main attraction
At my shows, my shows, watch me do
100 bottles, none for you
I’m rolling weed up, I’m getting high
And since I came up, she want me to come inside
I'm the fuckin' guy man I'm just I’m just too much, yeah too much
I twist my fingers, my crew up
I’m from where niggas get chewed up
Fucked around and I blew up
Me and my niggas hit the charts
Fucked around and I flew up
Yeah a nigga got 2 nuts, and I still don’t give a 2 fucks
Bitch I do it

[Hook]
She had, better be a keeper, I don’t think I ever seen a girl so fly
Since I said nice to meet ya, I don’t wanna leave her
Oh I think I really wanna make you mine
Uh baby you're a diva, I don’t wanna see her
End up with any other guys
Come over to the table, I got what you came for
Pick up a glass girl and let’s get right
Cause you got a hell of a body
Let me take you to Jail Little Mommy
Cause you got what I need and I got what you came for
I can give you what these other niggas ain’t able

Oh baby girl we’re doing it so big
I make these other niggas wanna do it like this
Oh baby girl we doing it so good
I keep on buying bottles if you keep on doing that
Go ahead and do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Tell them bring them fireworks to my table
Go ahead and do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
I’mma keep it moving, as long as you can do it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
We got buckets filled of ice, take the bottles all in
At the club Stuntin' hard stealin' all ya'll women
Never asked how we get em' Just ask how many, Now bow down to respect this pimpim'
Ain't no kids here, she high as I'm gone be next year
We leave the Club they meet us there, Oh nair back it in the air
Tatted on her dariar, and piercings where it's very rare
Ain't no sippin' N/E Player, We balling, we be everywhere
Her fly without a Parasail, she say I’m sweet as caramel
She rub my back and Cause what happened ended like a Fairy Tale
You better ask Tyrese about my freaks I did his 6's Not my weaks
You feel they purse I feel they cheeks, They Gentlemen but still ain't G
They Cali and Miami, When they standing at on table
See them bottles with them fireworks, Nowhere they are the way to go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Hold up, man, shawty let it way a nigga really count this cash
Wait a minute, shawty (whaaaat)
Better know a nigga really love the way you go and bounce your ass
Yall already know the shit that I be doin when a nigga come
And then I go and do it to the street and
Then I get upon the mic and
Then I'm walkin and I'm talkin and I'm strangling a nigga when I get upon the beat
Where the fireworkz bottles at? (hurry up!)
Go sit down while I pop shit up
Yall don’t want a problem
When I come and kinda step in the party
Niggas know I always fucks it up
DJ hear my verse then wanna cut shit up
Always keep your heater cuz I must grip up
No slouse kill a nigga no doubt
Like we in a coke house, everybody’s cut breaks out

[Hook]
