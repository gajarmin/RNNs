[Verse 1]
First things first, I'm the realest
Drop this and let the whole world feel it
And I'm still in the murda bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics
You should want a bad bitch like this
Drop it low and pick it up just like this
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spillin', you should taste that

[Hook]
Stuntin', Ric Flair on yah
My stock high, blow the whole share on yah
Aye, gotta know that I'm prepared for yah
Tell me how you want it, I could leave it right there for yah
Aye, I could leave it right there for yah
Tell me how you want it, I could leave it right there for yah
Aye, gotta know that I'm prepared for yah
Tell me how you want it, I'mma leave it right there for yah

[Verse 2]
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
And get my money on time, if it ain't bout money, decline
And I swear I meant that there so much that I'll give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if it ain't bout money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who dat, who dat? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be the I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been workin', I'm up in here with some change to throw

[Hook]

[Bridge: Skeme]
Now tell me how you want it, and tell me how it feels
When you ride with the queen in the fast lane, makin' fast change
Baby, uh, for real though
Now let it, pour that, leave it right there for yah
So now you ain't scared, are yah? Still down for me
I'm on the go, hope you bound to get around with me

[Hook][Hook]
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Now I need all thirty-six Os out the whole thing
My watch be telling me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Wake up in the morning feeling like we don't deserve this
Once we get it started, ain't no way you could reverse this
We do this for real, it ain't no way to rehearse this
You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch

[Verse 1: Skeme]
I used to flip them things and get that change up out 'em
Young nigga done got that change
But ain't shit changed about him
I put my neck down on the line, got twenty chains around it
You ain't talking 'bout no money, we don't hear about it
Tell all your niggas we don't need the convo
I'm a have twenty hoes twerk at the condo
I been riding since the summer of '87
Crazy thing, I wasn't born till the '9 0
All of them years we was broke what I shine for
Got me separating zeros like grind for
I break a nine out the motherfucking brick with my eyes closed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Snitches get stitches
I feel like you niggas some fakes and some bitches
These niggas willl tell on they partners
Just hoping the judge give a break on the sentence
Hand on the wheel, I just handle my business
And I wish dollar bill was living a witness
The way this lil nigga done round up them digits
Man, I got that gift like it came with ribbon
I tell these liberty bitches that I ain't switching
'Less we talking 'bout switching positions
I turn the wood to the worth for my niggas
I hope that shit did make a difference
They dodge a homie cause of codeine I'm sipping
These glasses, homie, gave me Cartier vision
They hating on me, faking on me, but still I ain't tripping

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I turn the wood to the worth for my niggas
I turn the wood to the worth for my niggas
I turn the wood to the worth for my...
Hope that shit did make a difference

[Hook][Hook]
Too high, can’t come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Verse 1: Game]
Back to the hoes
Ridin' down 7-4th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy
Cadillac and a coupe
See them niggas hatin from afar, can’t catch em now
But they getting smacked when we do
Ra ta ta like we snoop
Crown on the vic
Crown on my wrist, crown on my bitch
And a couple crowns on my crew
Couple pounds of the blue
Ivy in it, tsunami in it when I be in it
Got the lobby in it, Tommy in it
The trunk got a body in it
Niggas be like he bodying it
Ziplock full of J’s, closet full of J’s
Workin' on my Pippen, he’s Scotty in it
Bath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it
8 gold chains like a Saudi in it
Murder with the ink, I’m Gotti in it
Don’t get too popped get your ass 2 Pac'd
Cargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it
Plus I still got a crib on Brazil
I ain’t never hardly there but I got a Maserati in it
That’s my new addition, nobody in it
Chop shops in the hood, no karate in it
So much money, got a money tree
Whoop so many niggas’ ass, shit we money team
Same fuck niggas with they hand out
Same sad song, bring the bands out
Nigga should be workin on they money scheme
Back to the convers, kill 'em with one verse
Converse with the worst til one of our gun burst
Call the mortuary, tell him niggas in one hearse
‘Cus Compton ain’t like the city of commerce
No back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt
Niggas got them choppas like we flyin' the black hawk
Put you with the roots, thinkin' a nigga was black thought
Now hold that thought
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Pray for me, I’ll make 30
Desert, even my nails dirty
Everything on life and I’d die for it
Made a mill, you ain’t even know it
Tell Illuminati I’m down for it
Call Jigga, I'm next nigga
Son niggas my new litter
Fuck the world on earth day
Her booty clap on my birthday
I would take the cake but I’ve been paid
I’m a real nigga, you’s arcade
Had a switch blade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama’s couch
Now I’m going big, I can buy the house
You sound water down, I sound off a ounce
See this for those who say "where you from"
If those hoes who gonna make me cum
With them fuck niggas we don’t fuck with them
And fuck niggas gonna lose a lung
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drum
If the bread low I’mma stack the crumb
Up the contraband in-between my gun
Before smoking dope I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G’s, nigga pretty please
Condos, where it’s sun and trees
10 keys with my 8 G’s
Hoover hats like the star of David
Pull on shots unless keep me faded
Ran up on 'em, I ain't good with aimin'
Move out the set but the set I’m banging

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Look, a young nigga really tryna stunt, fuck it
West side Ingles and I ain’t budging
Independent niggas with no budget
If it ain’t about a dollar gotta change subjects
Rap ass niggas ain’t sayin nothing
This flow here, niggas can’t touch it
Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket
Sox gang off in the streets
10 hut, bring the squadron with me
See niggas talk ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me, now quit talkin to me
Can I vent? All you niggas sound retarded to me
Killin these niggas, I’m a general nigga
Turn yo head to target for free
Now I’m on, look at me
Started, started with them pistols and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood
Niggas gotta know that that’s all me
See the set catch rap
When I slide through throwin up all bills
And niggas wanna act like they thuggin like us, we said boy please
This S to the K to the E to the Mmm nigga
New Rolls go vroom nigga
.45 cocked back like boom nigga
Got enough loot to fill up a room nigga
And I’m rolling these blunts at 100 a go
Gave her that dick now she beggin' for more
Made me a millie, yo bitch load is illie
But I ain’t got, still got 100 to go
And I do it, I does it
I spit it, you love it
I just left from Newark, got bands in my luggage
Play with you rappers, my nigga this bloodin'
Take out my dick, take a piss on the public like fuck it

[Hook]

[Welcome To California]
[Intro: Too Short]
Welcome to California bitch
Welcome to California bitch

[Hook 2]
Sky’s not the only place
Sounds like a BS
I know another place
Where you can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining

[Verse 4: Game]
Nigga done been everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home
C-O-M-P-T-O-N on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from grandmother’s porch to my executive Porsche
Now I’m driving through London and Rome
With a Parisian bitch
Rockin corn rows, backseat of my Panamera watchin' pornos
Where we goin? What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg, leave the city in ruins
Then fly to Dubai on my poolside, coolin'
My Audemar ain't waterproof, fuck it go and get a new one
I done been everywhere around the world and that’s cool
But can't no hotel fuckin' reserve us parked through
My hood gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move to back to Compton shit, we ought to
Condos on Wilshire, shit I bought two
Livin' down the street where BIG got shot, I haunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It’s how we live our life, surrounded by tape
Pause

[Verse 5: Game]
Where the angels fly, city of angels I will never let you down
Kill anything approaching my crown
Still undefeated
That’s why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don’t get it confused, city still got rules
Wear the wrong colors, nigga end up on the news
Lights out like Durant in a Drew
Then I’m right back down Compton avenue in a Buick
If you had a heart, niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts would you walk through it?
Would you be from Grape Street or would you Piru it?
Here’s my red rag, it says, "ain’t nothing to it"
They go the 60’s, motherfucker good luck
(Welcome to California bitch)
They go the 60’s, motherfucker good luck

[Verse 6: Schoolboy Q]
From the corner where that hoes said to kick at
Short dress, hair down the bizack
You know me with my thumb in my index
Nah, I ain’t bloodin' nigga
Pass blunts to my cousins nigga
Turn hell into gold, I can pon the river
HiiiPower, you a Amish liver
Cali dro in my lungs and such
Twisted blunts from dawn to dusk
My shoe box should’ve been a armored truck
Everything good, feeling marvelous
Came to the city, that you honored us
You don’t talk me a Game, no game homie
Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it
Uh, and this the 3rd degree
Burn like the bridge and yo business, uh
Started at the floor, at the beginning, uh
Now I rep the floor until the ending, uh
Smoking on L's cause I’m winnin', uh
Wax getting blowed, just to kindle it, uh
Uh, yea now back to the groove, back to the hoes
Ra ta ta in the lap with the 2
No Cali J, I still ran all blow
All in the trim, straight lookin like you
Figg tattoo

[Verse 7: Schoolboy Q]
I’m in the gangsta shit, gangsta clothes and gangsta crib
Need a gangsta bitch to take the dope and hop the fence
Might die on the freeway
Hey, much love to the Kee-Way, aye
Watch you know about LA?
(Welcome to California bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they dome us
(Welcome to California bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they, pop pop pop

[Hook 2]

[Verse 8: Skeme]
Got a bitch, say she wanna fuck in Beverly Hills
And I swear I’mma bring her to the set if she will
And if I do the pussy better be killed
Just the way I make her feel, no Stephanie Mills
These niggas heavily trill, these haters never be real
I came up in a world where it’s kill or be killed
I swear that every bitch I used to fuck, fuckin' me still
Just give a dick, never covered a bill
This shit is real, this west side INGLCL
Bands on them bitches, getting ends on them bitches
Gold framed Cartier lives on the bitches
Last long like I’m using extends on them bitches
I’m a native, I got real niggas with me
Golden state, gold grills, I put on for the Betty White
Middle fingers for the pigs
Tell them bitch niggas suck a dick
Man come and get me aight

[Outro]
This nigga Chuck want a nigga be in here
Rappin' all day and shit
Blood, I got to go get my shit braided
Nigga ends and shit all out
And I ain't got no lean?
Fuck this, we out this bitch
What's happening though?
(Welcome to California bitch)

[Hook 2][Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Y-O]
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus

[Thurz]
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
I’m still serving, broads on my TIP for gratuities

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Skeme]
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!
Got the world going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it

[Brown]
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
Hoes are choosing, niggas hating, we ain’t tripping, keep our balance

[Hook 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
These hoes want to love me man
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm bout to make that halo burn, goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside of Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker

Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this[Verse 1: Game]
I got a black mac and a six pack
I don't work out, I don't chit chat
My bitch bad, I get racks
That Rolls Royce, come gift-wrapped
Them birds still come shrink-wrapped
I'm not strapped, don't think that
I'm low key with that click clack
That rat a tat tat tat tat
Throw the burner and I'm runnin' home
Niggas stop being loyal when the money gone
Still walk in this bitch, I'm a hundred strong
One chain on my neck, feel like I got a hundred on
Look at my flow on this bitch
Platinum and gold on my wrist
Money, the accountant be countin' it
That's why I'm throwin' this shit
I'm in BK with that SK
Same clothes since yesterday
With that Biggie Smalls on replay
And I ain’t wearing no vest today
I do the Shmoney dance with this mac
You better do it too or get Shmurda’d
I be grilling that beef, I ain’t talkin’ no burgers
I finna be walkin’ like I’m a New Yorker
I let off the K and then I hop in the Uber
It’s never a question that I am the shooter
I empty the clip and lay you in a pool of
Blood, see how he got hit with the Ruger?
Blood, bandana that’s how we be movin’
Blood, swooping from Compton to Brooklyn
And this ain’t the Barclays but niggas be shootin’

[Hook: Bobby Shmurda] (x2)
Running niggas down back and forth
I’m like pass the torch, blast it off
Niggas making bets so who gonna blast him off?
First to score
We gon’ hit 'em hard, we gon’ hit 'em all
First to score
We gon’ hit 'em all, we gon’ hit 'em hard

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Running cocaina back and forth, copped the bag of salt
E-S to the G-N, I’m the boss dropped the package off
Coming for the murder, masks is off
Bitch you took a loss
Fuck the D.E.A. we shook ‘em off
Bitch we shook ‘em off
Shook and twist the jars
And dope on my momma's stove top
By the time she came back from church boy
I bet you I had an O stocked
In the middle of the muhfuckin' day
No more yayo, boy I done sold out
Nigga pull up in a mothafuckin’ foreign
On forgies that’ll bring them hoes out
Like yeah nigga, niggas keep beggin’
I pull out a pump in this bitch like I’m blizzard
Yeah, empty your pockets, we robbin’
These bitches got all of us trippin’
Nigga, it’s better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission
You catchin’ the hollow, I’m catchin’ you slippin'
I did it alone, only God as my witness
My nigga got off cause we tied up the witness
And made sure the nigga couldn't show up in court
You know the business, them niggas find out that you snitchin'
Them niggas gon' be at your throat
Everyday Halloween niggas will go trick or treatin'
With two twenty-three at your door
Flippin' a check off this rappin'
Go back to the trap and put that in the weed and the blow like

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Skeme]
I just caught a body like a week ago
These hatin' niggas want attention, I don't see 'em though
You talk that gangsta shit, but I just can't believe it bro
We pull up with them shots, knockin' out that European BOOM!
S to the K to the E-M-E
Callin' the EMT after I empted this clip
I sold my dope right on CMT
I'm at the ING, know I'm as weird as it gets
Chuck Taylor told me it's fuck haters
So I say fuck 'em and bury these niggas in pits
Rolley on wrist, no tock or no tick
Your girl on my dick, man come get your bitch
Niggas think this a rap now
I might back down and come try your luck
Riders with me be wired up
They ridin' with me till the tires bust
Haters talkin' but they better cool it
Before that nigga Crooked get fired up
Lay you out like my Balmains
You gotta play 'em straight, he get ironed up
Drinkin' lean till I'm high enough
I don't give a fuck about nan nigga
I ain't squashin' shit, I won't call it off
I just handle mine like a man nigga
I'm on frontline with these bands nigga
Need a chair, I can't stand niggas
We do walk-by's and hop outs
Got slidin' doors on that van nigga

[Hook] (x2)[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
If it don't make money, it don't make sense

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Look, if you don't know a thing about me know that homie rep
Another nigga cold as me, that shit just don't exist
No experience in acting, but stick to the script
See bitch, my presence be a present, I just got the gift
And don't attach my name to it if it ain't legit
Won't even waste no game on her if she ain't gone strip
Young nigga on a mission, only plot be this
I can melt this Cuban link and make a pot to piss
Westside on mine, I keep them check signs online
Ain't no handouts, that been ran out, so nigga best be on yo' grind
Never struggle with it, never love this business, I don't cuddle with it
If that plane work, it's automatic, back to huddle with it
That ain't fully loaded, ain't no levels, I ain't fucking with it
Tuck and grip, any nigga tripping tell him come and get it
I'm from the land where all the skinny niggas ride
Where we ain't never been touched even though plenty niggas tried

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
If it don't make money, it don't make sense

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
If you don't know a thing about me, know I'm taking risks
Started recording in '06 now it's making sense
Why my cousin used to tell me just keep making hits
And now he locked behind the fence and I'm just making chips
I know most you niggas out here is fake as shit
And everybody paid bitch, so you ain't exempt
You niggas still be buying J's before you pay your rent
Meanwhile, I'm out of town with this [?]
In the Biggie Smalls hat with the [?]
I pulled $100,000 out and told him hate on this
How we always be with Nip' but he ain't no crip
I'm just a Westside nigga, so I don't take no shit
Like the fruit of Islam, nigga this ain't no [?]
Don't try to salt a nigga name because it ain't gone stick
You trying to wear a nigga Vans, but they just ain't gone fit
So I went and talked to Quik and he told me this:

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
If it don't make money, it don't make sense[Verse 1 – Skeme]
Young S K E woah
Some folks say he so
G A N G S T A
T T G O
I won’t cut cake these hoes
Man I’d rather chase this dough
Only suckers put pussy over paper
Fuck y’all take me for?
And before I eat steaks with fakes I throw a ski mask on my face
Put my right shoulder to a front door and then run in and snatch me a safe
Went and made a meal then I said my grace
Then I cleaned everything on my plate
Then I hit a bad bitch, I made her cum first
Then I came fashionably late

[Hook]
Right, don’t compare me with no rat niggas
Came from the trenches, now look where we at nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga

[Verse 2 – Young Thug]
Rari for the trash and a Rari for the luxury
Bands for my mama’s kids and bands for my children
Come and make a deal like a motherfucking pickle
I am so for real, sold half a million ‘fore I killed you
I’m after shawty, his bitch think that I am the bomb like a mo’fucking missile
Catch me in traffic when you see me don’t look suprizzled
You don’t want war we kill niggas, and go bout our day like it’s nizzle
I’m so official, might [?] Trey Songz the Trigga

[Hook]
Don’t compare me with no rat niggas
Came from the trenches, now look where we at nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga

[Verse 3 – Skeme]
Reviewing deals on my iPhone, you know paper be my priority
But that paper don’t sit over loyalty
I follow G codes, ain’t no ho in me
I’m that nigga, that nigga that pull up with killers
And knock on the haters that say they don’t feel us
Been triller, so triller, get skrilla for realer
My bank account overstuffed, keep them shits filled up
Overloaded, bloated, pockets overflowing
Got to get this dough and blow it like I grow it
Necklace heavy, glowing
And I leave this show in gold grills, looking like I rep the Nolia
I got too much drive to call a fucking chauffeur
High as heaven, tryna parallel the rover
In this beeper bitch we going [?]
You niggas out here be sweet as Russel Stovers

[Hook]
Don’t compare me with no rat niggas
Came from the trenches, now look where we at nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga[Hook]
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Now I need all thirty-six Os out the whole thing

You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch

[Verse 1: Skeme]
I used to flip them things and get that change up out 'em
Young nigga done got that change
But ain't shit changed about him
I put my neck down on the line, got twenty chains around it
You ain't talking 'bout no money, we don't hear about it
Tell all your niggas we don't need the convo
I'm a have twenty hoes twerk at the condo
I been riding since the summer of '87
Crazy thing, I wasn't born till the '9 0
All of them years we was broke what I shine for
Got me separating zeros like grind for
I break a nine out the motherfucking brick with my eyes closed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Snitches get stitches
I feel like you niggas some fakes and some bitches
These niggas willl tell on they partners
Just hoping the judge give a break on the sentence
Hand on the wheel, I just handle my business
And I wish dollar bill was living a witness
The way this lil nigga done round up them digits
Man, I got that gift like it came with ribbon
I tell these liberty bitches that I ain't switching
'Less we talking 'bout switching positions
I turn the wood to the worth for my niggas
I hope that shit did make a difference
They dodge a homie cause of codeine I'm sipping
These glasses, homie, gave me Cartier vision
They hating on me, faking on me, but still I ain't tripping

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I turn the wood to the worth for my niggas

I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gon feel
Cause I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said you know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gonna feel
Cause I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said you know real niggas ain’t perfect

[Verse 1: Skeme]
It goes real niggas ain’t perfect, perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gon feel
Cause man I was born real and gonna die real
You gotta stay down, that’s how I feel
Can’t be worried about another nigga
No, I just worry bout my bills
And I’m livin life to the fullest
Trigger finger itchin bitch then I pull it
Got me a 4-5, 19-11
With 4 metal jackets for these bullets
I done did everything that you couldn’t
You might sail out but I wouldn’t
And if the rap fall out then it’s traps all out
Bring the pots back cause I’m cooking

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
And it go real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
Man ain’t one rapper in the game right now got a half a ticket with no deal
See I don’t fuck with niggas cause that shit weak
Besides dirty drinkin ain’t shit sweet
Snake niggas wanna go behind your back
Just like the past repents pistol pete
And these little niggas that be dissin me
Let nina sing to you, no symphony
To keep it 100 I got old money
Now put it on yo head and you’re history
You can’t fuck with I, not physically
Not mentally, you ain’t shit to me
Money talks and bullshit walks
So you broke niggas just don’t mention me and I

[hook:]

[Verse 3: Wale]
They say trill niggas just working
I’m supposed to bitch
Real niggas ain’t perfect
But I’m close to it
Coast to coast, where your focus at?
Big up the coach and niggas stole from that
Where yo soldiers at? Where yo hoes is at?
All my niggas in tracks but all my hoes in check uh
Thought I told you that
DMV, you know we on the map
P.I.M.P they callin me cause all the H.O.E.S is calling back uh
Now we like em, love em and leave em man
You heard big brother’s CD
Now we both stay skeming
I’m out

[Hook:][Hook]
Too high, can’t come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Verse 1: Game]
Back to the hoes
Ridin' down 7-4th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy
Cadillac and a coupe
See them niggas hatin from afar, can’t catch em now
But they getting smacked when we do
Ra ta ta like we snoop
Crown on the vic
Crown on my wrist, crown on my bitch
And a couple crowns on my crew
Couple pounds of the blue
Ivy in it, tsunami in it when I be in it
Got the lobby in it, Tommy in it
The trunk got a body in it
Niggas be like he bodying it
Ziplock full of J’s, closet full of J’s
Workin' on my Pippen, he’s Scotty in it
Bath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it
8 gold chains like a Saudi in it
Murder with the ink, I’m Gotti in it
Don’t get too popped get your ass 2 Pac'd
Cargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it
Plus I still got a crib on Brazil
I ain’t never hardly there but I got a Maserati in it
That’s my new addition, nobody in it
Chop shops in the hood, no karate in it
So much money, got a money tree
Whoop so many niggas’ ass, shit we money team
Same fuck niggas with they hand out
Same sad song, bring the bands out
Nigga should be workin on they money scheme
Back to the convers, kill 'em with one verse
Converse with the worst til one of our gun burst
Call the mortuary, tell him niggas in one hearse
‘Cus Compton ain’t like the city of commerce
No back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt
Niggas got them choppas like we flyin' the black hawk
Put you with the roots, thinkin' a nigga was black thought
Now hold that thought
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Pray for me, I’ll make 30
Desert, even my nails dirty
Everything on life and I’d die for it
Made a mill, you ain’t even know it
Tell Illuminati I’m down for it
Call Jigga, I'm next nigga
Son niggas my new litter
Fuck the world on earth day
Her booty clap on my birthday
I would take the cake but I’ve been paid
I’m a real nigga, you’s arcade
Had a switch blade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama’s couch
Now I’m going big, I can buy the house
You sound water down, I sound off a ounce
See this for those who say "where you from"
If those hoes who gonna make me cum
With them fuck niggas we don’t fuck with them
And fuck niggas gonna lose a lung
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drum
If the bread low I’mma stack the crumb
Up the contraband in-between my gun
Before smoking dope I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G’s, nigga pretty please
Condos, where it’s sun and trees
10 keys with my 8 G’s
Hoover hats like the star of David
Pull on shots unless keep me faded
Ran up on 'em, I ain't good with aimin'
Move out the set but the set I’m banging

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Look, a young nigga really tryna stunt, fuck it
West side Ingles and I ain’t budging
Independent niggas with no budget
If it ain’t about a dollar gotta change subjects
Rap ass niggas ain’t sayin nothing
This flow here, niggas can’t touch it
Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket
Sox gang off in the streets
10 hut, bring the squadron with me
See niggas talk ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me, now quit talkin to me
Can I vent? All you niggas sound retarded to me
Killin these niggas, I’m a general nigga
Turn yo head to target for free
Now I’m on, look at me
Started, started with them pistols and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood
Niggas gotta know that that’s all me
See the set catch rap
When I slide through throwin up all bills
And niggas wanna act like they thuggin like us, we said boy please
This S to the K to the E to the Mmm nigga
New Rolls go vroom nigga
.45 cocked back like boom nigga
Got enough loot to fill up a room nigga
And I’m rolling these blunts at 100 a go
Gave her that dick now she beggin' for more
Made me a millie, yo bitch load is illie
But I ain’t got, still got 100 to go
And I do it, I does it
I spit it, you love it
I just left from Newark, got bands in my luggage
Play with you rappers, my nigga this bloodin'
Take out my dick, take a piss on the public like fuck it

[Hook]

[Welcome To California]
[Intro: Too Short]
Welcome to California bitch
Welcome to California bitch

[Hook 2]
Sky’s not the only place
Sounds like a BS
I know another place
Where you can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining

[Verse 4: Game]
Nigga done been everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home
C-O-M-P-T-O-N on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from grandmother’s porch to my executive Porsche
Now I’m driving through London and Rome
With a Parisian bitch
Rockin corn rows, backseat of my Panamera watchin' pornos
Where we goin? What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg, leave the city in ruins
Then fly to Dubai on my poolside, coolin'
My Audemar ain't waterproof, fuck it go and get a new one
I done been everywhere around the world and that’s cool
But can't no hotel fuckin' reserve us parked through
My hood gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move to back to Compton shit, we ought to
Condos on Wilshire, shit I bought two
Livin' down the street where BIG got shot, I haunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It’s how we live our life, surrounded by tape
Pause

[Verse 5: Game]
Where the angels fly, city of angels I will never let you down
Kill anything approaching my crown
Still undefeated
That’s why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don’t get it confused, city still got rules
Wear the wrong colors, nigga end up on the news
Lights out like Durant in a Drew
Then I’m right back down Compton avenue in a Buick
If you had a heart, niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts would you walk through it?
Would you be from Grape Street or would you Piru it?
Here’s my red rag, it says, "ain’t nothing to it"
They go the 60’s, motherfucker good luck
(Welcome to California bitch)
They go the 60’s, motherfucker good luck

[Verse 6: Schoolboy Q]
From the corner where that hoes said to kick at
Short dress, hair down the bizack
You know me with my thumb in my index
Nah, I ain’t bloodin' nigga
Pass blunts to my cousins nigga
Turn hell into gold, I can pon the river
HiiiPower, you a Amish liver
Cali dro in my lungs and such
Twisted blunts from dawn to dusk
My shoe box should’ve been a armored truck
Everything good, feeling marvelous
Came to the city, that you honored us
You don’t talk me a Game, no game homie
Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it
Uh, and this the 3rd degree
Burn like the bridge and yo business, uh
Started at the floor, at the beginning, uh
Now I rep the floor until the ending, uh
Smoking on L's cause I’m winnin', uh
Wax getting blowed, just to kindle it, uh
Uh, yea now back to the groove, back to the hoes
Ra ta ta in the lap with the 2
No Cali J, I still ran all blow
All in the trim, straight lookin like you
Figg tattoo

[Verse 7: Schoolboy Q]
I’m in the gangsta shit, gangsta clothes and gangsta crib
Need a gangsta bitch to take the dope and hop the fence
Might die on the freeway
Hey, much love to the Kee-Way, aye
Watch you know about LA?
(Welcome to California bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they dome us
(Welcome to California bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they, pop pop pop

[Hook 2]

[Verse 8: Skeme]
Got a bitch, say she wanna fuck in Beverly Hills
And I swear I’mma bring her to the set if she will
And if I do the pussy better be killed
Just the way I make her feel, no Stephanie Mills
These niggas heavily trill, these haters never be real
I came up in a world where it’s kill or be killed
I swear that every bitch I used to fuck, fuckin' me still
Just give a dick, never covered a bill
This shit is real, this west side INGLCL
Bands on them bitches, getting ends on them bitches
Gold framed Cartier lives on the bitches
Last long like I’m using extends on them bitches
I’m a native, I got real niggas with me
Golden state, gold grills, I put on for the Betty White
Middle fingers for the pigs
Tell them bitch niggas suck a dick
Man come and get me aight

[Outro]
This nigga Chuck want a nigga be in here
Rappin' all day and shit
Blood, I got to go get my shit braided
Nigga ends and shit all out
And I ain't got no lean?
Fuck this, we out this bitch
What's happening though?
(Welcome to California bitch)

[Hook 2][Verse 1: Skeme]
I hear I changed I hear I lost all my humility
But humility ain't worth shit when you need 50 Gees
To bail your cousin out that cell you know this life is hell
So I'm back to acting an ass 'cuz that's what I do well
Hope you don't got your hand out
Hope you grinding for self
Hope you don't think this world 'gone listen when you cry for help
Naw man, see this shit stiff as a shot of scotch
Like hide and seek it's coming for you, ready or not
Back when I was sixteen all I'd do was hustle to get off my block
Fuck being a have-not I promise man I need my knots
That .22 inside my socks 'cuz it's shoot first or you get shot
Poppa say protect your neck, 'cuz these niggas want what you got
So you know I'm sleeping
(one eye open)
And when I'm wide awake
(that same eye is over my shoulder)
'cuz I heard that most times the ones that
(kill you 'gone be the closest)
So if I ain't know you 'fore we got poppin'
(quit that bro shit)

[Hook]
(I know exactly what you thinking mama
He just another hood nigga
I'm screaming more money more problems
But still it's all good nigga)
We want it all
We want it all
We want it all
We, we, we, we, we
We want it all
We want it all
Dying to live, but we born to ball

[Verse 2: Skeme]
What's on your mind, what's on your mind?
You been on my mind and I want to chill
But I've been on my grind
Hate to see you crying but baby girl that's how this life thing work
All emotions aside I outride (?) my business first
And if I had a dime for every time I heard that patience is a virture
I'd buy more shit I don't need my hunger for what they feed (?)
Got some bad ones in my past
Hope they don't think I forget 'em
But I'm all about my bills
Grind stay Hillary Rodham
What's my problem?
I'm acting like I got nothing
But really I got it all
Can't never take nothing personal
There's no feelings involved
'Cuz you know this ain't no job right?
Nigga this my life
That's why I think twice about all the shit that I write
Now my pen ignite and my soul take flight to set me free
Flow throwed off 'cuz I miss Pimp C to keep it Gee
And this right here it might be the illest shit that I ever wrote
'Cuz I put my problems in my carry-on then I let 'em go
Thought I let you know

[Hook repeated]

[Spoken: Skeme]
Whatever your reality is, chase that, your own truth, you feel me? I know I am. Pour some more of that shit up, bro. Think this one here over with, bro[Intro]

You ain't hoeing you gone be one, RJ!

[Verse 2: Royce The Choice]
Look, got him texting her he need something

We ain't fucking I won't even make a statement

[Hook: Royce The Choice]
To the ground type shit

Call me: "Skeme" call me: "Crooked" or "The Bad Bitch Killa" huh

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yeah
Girl you a intern, know you with the business
A ho, a housewife
Tell me whats the difference
She never seen a young nigga make a living
Riding whips that her daddy ain't getting
Yeah, if we don't grind we don't eat though
Them girls love me from the valley down to Pico
If she bout it she gone let a nigga see something
If she suck it then I might have to eat something

[Hook]

[Verse 4: TC4800]
Aye uh
I got hoes in my catalog
Town nigga bang to the yankee call
Uh, "cash out" them my favorite words
Pull up on a bitch I don't say a word
I hit the mall then my niggas splurge
Ride up on yo bitch she got a lot of curves
Hit the purp, hit the purp nigga
She got big doors, she go to work nigga

[Verse 5: Reem Riches]
Wabitty wabitty drop drop it like it's hot
Then take it to the top, and make the pussy pop
It's young Reem
You know I got a thing for thick bitches
You know i got a thing for big knots, my name "Riches"
Drop it low, then shake it like a seizure
I hit it, next day catch amnesia
Balling, young nigga movement
Got ya bitch choosing
Bouncing all stupid, like

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
See I don't fuck with sucka nigga's
Cause that shit get on my nerves
Fuck your trap, I'm paid off rap
Might make a million off of words
Hoppin' straight from off the curb
Filling clips and choppin' birds
And I'm still with all the shit, we give a fuck what nigga's heard
Ask around about the dude, they say they know I'm the shit
Keep a four ounce in my soda, keep your ho on my dick
I just might say fuck this rappin, might go hit me a lick
And if my money gettin' low, we might give yo dough a kick

[Hook]
Cause I got partners who pimpin', I got homies who flockin'
I got killers who knockin' on shit, if we got a problem
So you best pick your battles, nigga snakes with no rattles
Tell a bitch I want that tail, as long as mommy no tattle
See, she might be with you, but that bitch likes me
I'm the people's champ ho, I'm on that rocking my beat
First comes the money, then comes the pussy
Then come them haters, but here come them bullets

[Verse 2]
See I don't fuck with police's, on my nephews and neices
Drug dealer designer, like all my shit with no creases
I know nigga's be hatin', bout' the money I'm making
Success stressing me out, won't understand til you make it
Fuck her once, no date
She get nothing but the basics
I got thots, all races, I swear to god we not racist
All I need is the fortune, bitch I been street famous
Everybody love me, I feel like I'm Raymond
Everybody know the dude, gotta be a square if you don't
I hear nigga's wanna knock me off, but nigga we know that you won't
I told that bitch to call my Crooked, but she keeps sayin' Daddy
Give that ass a high-five, and tell her throw it back at me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
These nigga's pussy, I can sniff it
I can snort it, this beat retarted
Hey, who that nigga be? Question rhetoric
My whip a foreign, You roll imported
I'm hearing voices in my head, let's just record it
Hey I got money, how I got it? ain't important
This shit is nothing, these nigga's frontin'
I'm making hits around this bitch, you nigga's buntin' (I'm out the park)
It's one take and this thing ain't punchin'
Got Boi-1da on the beat, this shit a lunchin'
One take in this bitch and I ain't punchin'
My stacks tall, you nigga's pockets on munchkin

[Hook][Verse One: Paypa]
Aye yo it’s Payp baby, valedictorian of this rap shit
I school niggas, you class clown, I’m classic
Love, peace and soul, I was trained to never fold
Don Cornelius the way I’m killing off the dome, I promise
That boy Paypa’s cut from a different fabric
I got a full house, I’m feeling like Bob Saget
You know you in your lane when them legends call your phone
And they hopping on your songs, got you feeling like you on
Emilio, I got you, them haters throwing stones
Let’s give ‘em something to rock to, paint the whole block blue
Call it coalition, my crew rocking like U2, the black Bono
Hustle mano a mano, classic like my black Reeboks in 8th grade
Classic like Caprice, I cut him short like capris for fucking with the crew
Nigga R-I-P, get a mask like Hamilton, step back and handle him, Paypa

[Verse Two: Phil Ade]
Bitches get around me and let they hair fall
So unless it’s about money, I don’t hear calls
We on friendship pikes, we don’t get near malls
You niggas have your shot, we yelling air ball
I’m a fucking asshole, won’t settle for less than great
I’m my state’s last hope, addicted to fast dough
Spitting the rap flows, these hoes drunk with love
I tell ‘em my tab closed, my heart stone, you can quit
Trying to figure me, speak up bad now, wait till you see a bigger me
Swagging on everybody that swagged on me
Yelling fuck you if you ain’t loyal fam by me
Man, fuck a Visa, all cash on me and I’m up in Stadium
It’s all ass on me, listening to Rah Gwan off of Dom P
And I’m probably with a car like my name was Don C, P

[Verse Three: Skeme]
Spirit of a fighter, got the heart of a rider
Niggas wanna play to win, never been about them games
Tell her to pour me a cup, tell that ho to fuck
But I get a nut just because the bitch know my name
Got a cup full of Texas, mouth full of Cali
Get my jays before they drop and walk around my house in Bally’s
Got some killers in New York, riding with the hump
Watch how you speaking ‘fore these wreakers have you outlined in chalk
I been doing my shit, know I’m on my tip
Goat nigga, treat her like a handle bar and get a grip
I’m from where it’s going down, you know bloods and the crips
Throwing up that dollar sign straight, no split
S-O-X the game bitch, never on no lame shit
Never talk to lame hoes ‘cause they don’t speak my language
Most these rappers ain’t shit but you know I ain’t trip
‘Cause they never test the gangster bitch, I told her that my aim sick
Fuck a hater with a homo dick and two’s better than one
So now I’m only hitting homo chicks, homie sick
Polo drawers on me, she get Polo dick, hold the clip
See the flash like a fucking photo strip, four to spit
Leaving niggas ducking, screaming holy shit
Murder scene tragic, I’m mafia movie classic

[Verse Four: Emilio Rojas]
I ain’t into no fast, frivolous with my cash, ain’t cheap though
This week alone, I just spent your rent on cabs, ride around in the back
I’m with a girl who steady bobbing and it look like I be dolo
‘Cause she low though, steady slobbing, I’m a classic, I’m in Polo
Jays got Nike logos, women in the back of the photos
Then I’mma get ‘em in the lap when I stroke those
So my flow is a no-so and your flow is all so so-so
If you ask me how I know so, I’mma laugh at you like bozo
Got a low pro and them hoes don’t come around at get togethers
As soon as Summer hit, I tell my bitch it’s mistress weather
Them chicks don’t get to spend a fucking night, they get a day pad
They mad, I look ‘em in the eye and tell ‘em they bad
Laid back in my crib, stay stacking my chips, my white friends
They get tight then ‘cause they mad I’m a spic
And they mad I’m the shit and I’mma get it on my own
Stacking paper like a high interest loan but baby, I’m a classic[Hook:]
I say I pull up in that Lamb and turn heads
Bitch I’m on fire, all we do is burn bread
This shit of mine, man it got em going crazy
Top floor, with the view, this shit amazing
Now just take one and look at it, you could tell that shit different
Tell that shit different, you could tell that shit different
Now just take one and look at it, you could tell that shit different
Tell that shit different, you could tell that shit different
Hold up!

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Pull up, hop out
Fuck it, it’s nothing
That money, my convo, don’t try to switch subjects
I got riders with choppas
And bitches with hoes
Stunting forever nigga just like we supposed
Now pour up that drink, laugh straight to that bank
We can’t see no limits like we riding around in that tank aye
You think you know but ain’t got no idea
I’m in that back to the future whip that don't drop till next year

[Hook:]


[Verse 2:]
You don't talk about it? I told it
Nigga say this shit, can you afford it?
These niggas is rats just like rodents
Click clack pow pow they reload it
Bitch I come down sippin potent
Realest nigga and you know it
They say they on with it but something wrong with it if me and my niggas just can’t notice
Nigga we winnin, it ain’t hard to tell that I’m cookin the [?], it ain’t hard to smell it
See bitch I’m a hustler so went to another
You bring it my way and I bet we could sell it
Refer that I to the N to the G
Shit that you talkin ain’t nothing to me
Run up on mine and I’m pullin this line
And I make sure you R to the I to the P

[Hook:][Verse 1]
Just another day in the life of crooked
Gotta do it big cause I know them haters lookin'
I'm doin' mines, on my grind show-bookin'
Kitchen smellin' good keep a bad bitch cookin'
Ha - This is life as a YG
Cash rules, that's the only thing that I see
Keep nothin' but them real niggas by me
Levi's, white tees, swear that's all a nigga needs
Yeah, can't forget that good weed
Now my eyes red, work to my high heads
I talk to 'em, but can't tell you what God said
Never you mind, just listen to this and nod head
Yeah, in it to win it like Bennett bitch
Fuck ho niggas, no time for censorship
If I feel the need to say it then it's said
I live to see these lame niggas dead
Get bread like -

[Hook]
Don't lose focus
Just keep on rollin'
Go 'head twist that, light that, blow that
Keep on smokin'
See I done been here and back before
So I'm already knowin'
Go 'head twist that, light that, blow that
Keep on smokin'
(Just keep on smokin')

[Verse 2]
Can't stand the rain against my window
Good kush got the youngin' breathin' in slow
Better yet, homie, everything is in slow -
Motion nigga, I'm focused, nigga
It's a pistol near by me if I'm posted, nigga
You could try me if you want - Get toasted, nigga
We get cash on the daily, act like you're all ready
OT I pack light, bitch, ball heavy
Been here, and I keep it real, is y'all ready?
I think not, nigga everything I ink hot
Money money over y'all, that's the mindstate
Get it nine ways, livin' proof that crime pays
On to the road to the riches with diamonds and bitches
Think with that head that's on your shoulders, not in your britches
And keep it real 'till the reaper come pay you a visit
Keep it one-hundred get this money my nigga what is it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga, you know what this is, that bang-bang shoot 'em up
G's hold your Rugers up, fuck is they gon' do with us
Bitches pullin' skirts down just cause niggas movin' up
Hater pull a false move, have his family suited up
Put them hands on him 'till he sway, seein' two of us
Then it's back to baggies, for rollin' and lightin' doobies up
Niggas learn to run their mouth until the toolie buck
You don't wanna play enemy in my mobster movie, bruh
Pourin' out my liquor for niggas no longer present
Purple by the 7's on a stairway up to heaven
Figa life is like a blessing but the little shit be stressin'
Like how is it these niggas don't vision me as the best, when -
I give you what you need, and what you want
Stuntin' for my fam, I know these other niggas won't
What they don't, nigga, that's just what I does
If you hate then bust a shot, if not, then show some love, what's up

[Hook][Verse 1: Kent]
She's addicted to kush and ectasy magnums
After I poked her she rolled over and told me match one
Didn't know what to say, got up tripped over her Jay's
Her hair all over the place, she started licking my face (eww)
She said my flow so amazing, my engineer should pay me
Only hit me up when your girlfriend act crazy
God sent me an angel with no wings, we stay high like a boeing
Smoke out queen we stay blowing, going, going, going ...

[Hook: Amanda]
I don't wanna be your girlfriend, I just wanna keep your blunts rolled (repeat)

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Ugh, yeah, yeah, .... yeah
Look, and she don't wanna be my main thang
She just tryna help a rapper maintain
I touch her soul with this dick she get the holy ghost
My loves a drug she's a fiend tryna overdoz
And we don't roll how them suckas do
In fact the circle that I sit inside is sucka proof
Look, my women wanna do what lovers do
I tell her its a privilege if ever I stop and fuck with you
Cuz its money over broke bitches and if you ain't broke then you should take The time to smoke with us
Now a days girls chasing I ain't saying much
Don't show her love so she tell her friends I'm playing up
If you should leave lady stay in touch
Or you could stay with us, and lay and fuck
She stale facing saying I'm too blatant
My stroke genius til I got no time for picture painting
Naw, I keep it G as I'm supposed to so you notice the fly guy when he Approach you
Don't want no girlfriend, no I don't want no girlfriend
Just ride or die as we get high, girl until the world end

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tube]
You don't wanna be my girlfriend good
Never have, never will, never would
You talking that shit cuz you know you could
But you could get this wood, if you feeling up to par
Slide on through, let me swoop yo car
And I'mma B-R-B-P-E-A-C-E-O-U-T
Cuz I don't love you, even lucky if I like you a whole lot
My mind preoccupied wit hitting the top but as long as I stay hitting the twat
You cool stefani, I'm honored
Being that you push everything aside for me even your morals
You know you come after my partners
Wanna fall in love, girl you so good to me
But I'm supposed to treat a bitch, like a bitch, its just the hood in me
I'mma always keep a chick, with some david blaine lips
Rollin blunts and licking nuts until she feel she gotta dip
(Now lemme do some doubles)

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sleezy]
Sticky situations got my sidepiece saying that she bout done fucking wit me
Man she say that i’m her favorite, can’t explain how much she hates when She hears some messy shit up in the streets
But she understands sleeze
Sorry darling i’m just what I gotta do
Seen them feelings coming so I had to call an audible
Like Favre would do
Always speaking like you leaving but it ain’t nothing stopping you
So while you here lemme feel them tonsils boo
I’m just tryna live my life
Up all night like Dolemite
Blowin mics and marijuana too
I got no time for you[Intro: DJ Drama]
You know we ain't creating the highway
We just made a new lane
Follow us....

[Verse 1: Skeme]
The rap game, ain't the trap man
No stressin', I'm relaxed man
I've been walking with this world on my shoulders
Still no complaint,[??]
I stayed true, where my profit at
[??]
No sleep, young insomniac
It ain't a M on the table, we ain't signing that (Whoooo)
I bought a pint, you know I had to sip
Real nigga trill 'til the casket dip
You could tell that I'm a rebel from the bezel
25 and still alive, where we from that's something special
Crooked crowns for the kings of the underground
Practice patience, everything that goes come around
Money counters counting by the hundred thou's
You ain't speaking [??]
Fuck we talkin' 'bout....

[Hook: Skeme]
What I say, goes [??] like my way
Papers got these haters lookin' sideways
Eyes wide shut on this highway
I'm throwed trying to make it in my driveway
Eyes wide shut on this highway
Praying that I make in my driveway
Jus' praying that I make it (oohh)
I'm praying that I make it (aayyhh)

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Young crooked, sophisticated
Presi rollie, I bought it just to remind me I made it
I'm up bright and early, after working the late shift
Money counter going (gunshot adlib),like I let off a K-clip
I tell all of my hoes, get low as a basement
Then I put that pound on her, dick feel like a basskick
Catch your rhythm in it, I'm talking boom boom clap
This your bloodcot [?]
[?]
S-K
Get it how you want it, press play
And when I pray I only ask him let me see the next day
(Aayy)
I could handle the rest
If life a bitch, young crooked got his hand up her dress..blessed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Hard thuggin', no budgin'
Big check, no budgets
I live fast and pass on past judgement
I don't -- only like it, nigga I fuckin' love it
I am raw, rough, and rugged when addressing the mass public
My attitude be fuck it, cause muthafuckas love it
All dude talk is cash and he ain't swtchin' the subject
So get a good look at him, that's everything that you wasn't
I be I-N-G-L-E, ain't shit ya'll could tell me
Full clips won't buy all that bullshit you sell me
Crooked bars stunt, while they nickle and dime
They could have whatever left
Bitch the world is mine

Nigga like me going brazy

[?] in a double cup, nigga tryna make the fucking hundreds double up
[?] nigga, I’m a breadwinner, and lately I could give a fuck about a runner up

I’ll be waiting right here with these dice then
Shooting with the homies, shooting niggas uninvited
I put you 6 feet under like you five ten
All my niggas shooting up and that’s five five
Sipping codeine, smoking chronic, tryna skydive
Nigga hype down, you could die now
If you hit the four pound with the extendo that’s a five pound
8 pounds and 6 pounds, that’s an 8 ball
What the fuck is you on?
Been surfing for the last ten years now

[Verse]
Look
Pimpin' ain't dead cause a nigga still living
Sox gang bang bitch and ain't never switch it
Ya man don't touch half the money I'm getting
I'm a stand up guy, but baby all my cars sitting
Move in slow motion off the potion I'm sipping
Double cup stuck, nigga I ain't even tripping
Ice in my ears make it hard for me to listen
And you ain't gotta ask if I'm on, it's a given
Now where the bread at, better yet, where your head at
Money up nigga, yea dat, act like I never said that
Smoking fire, stacks on too tall
Trying to find a bitch with old money and new draws
Girl I'm a killer
Them other niggas buying, girl you're talking to the dealer
Dollar go-getter, wood gold realer
Nigga 8 shots fired split em up like Swishers
What it do, see they don't have a clue
She said she heard I was raw, I said that rumor is true
Sitting in the coupe, trying not to look cooped up
Ice cream paint, bitches die to get scooped up
Shoutout big Dom, ho choose up
If you ain't with it bitch, you can beat it, duece up
Money make a bitch recognize
And if not, bitch, get a better set of eyes
Fly like falcons and high like mountains
My cash stack stupid and we ain't even counting
Champagne on pour like a fountain
You know that Rosé is no less than two thousand
Sire(?) in this motherfucker with me, too geeked
Got the squad blacked out, boy, too deep
Get your ass stomped trying to run up on me
Cause all my niggas on go and all my bitches on E
Yeah, turn me up and turn me on
You know I'm in my zone, I got kush in my cologne
For LA I'm putting on, bitch this where I belong
I be smoking on that strong, like my women to be grown
Flow so diesel, you are no equal
Number one gunner, other rappers just sequels
Pistols & Palm Trees, boy this here a prequel
Flying in shittin' on them boys, seagulls
No redo, bitch, you know we do
Hit a 3 like them Heat(?) do[Hook 1: Skeme]
Was on the outside lookin now we in
And life’s still a bitch but we live
I done kept it G from the beginning
So blur that bullshit and focus on this business

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Look, I’m worth my weight in gold (and that’s fo sho)
Don’t give a fuck, make sure my haters know
Bitch I’m bout this dough
This game I kick, it creeks my paper flow
Every year get a new set, we’s no HBO
Got class in session, bitch start takin notes (let’s make it flow)
The gang forever til the day I go (bitch that’s out to go)
You watched my struggle now just watch me blow (word)
Cuz at this point a loss ain’t optional, no

[Hook 1: Skeme]

[Hook 2: Skeme]
Blur that bullshit and focus on yo business
Blur that bullshit and focus on yo business
You know they sayin money come like it go
So blur that bullshit and focus on yo business

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I’m from Leimert, Skeme from the wood
Drew from the bay, I ball from Venice
Niggas was rapping and getting pussy
And getting money, I didn't invent it
I listen to NNer, true to my word
Doing superb as I have predicted
Back in 06 now we legit
It tasted with shrimp, we can’t get evicted
We gon go hard then we gon shop
Straight to the lot, cars expensive
So what they hoes
Going there with me
They know it’s for real so they don’t be trippin
I don’t do snitches or bitches with cameras
That after we fuck they like to take pictures
My name is Dom, this OPM
Leisure size gang, we all here are winners

[Hook 1 & 2]

[Verse 3: Skeme]
I just keep spittin the shit that I know niggas feelin cuz niggas be feelin like me
And I just got in this industry while you was in the street
Bitch I was out on these streets
Nowadays ballin nice, we was hungry as fuck
I just make sure my niggas gon eat
And for when I couldn’t afford it, my clothing imported, designers from head to my feet
And if you was askin me where I stunt
I remember hittin the porch for free lunch
Got this cash, I’m bout to re-up
Relax, hit back with my both my feet up
SG ODB for life
Tell them niggas we up
Better yet tell em niggas G up
It’s a money marathon tell that hater keep up

[Hook 1 & 2][Intro: DUBB]
It's DUBB
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Hook: DUBB]
Beast on the loose and my stomach is rumblin'
These niggas out here just food for my stomach
Get the fuck out the way when the lions is comin'
The elephant's stompin', gorillas is jumpin'
The snakes full of venom, the wolves out in London
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo

[Verse 1: DUBB]
I sink in my teeth cause these niggas is sweet
Predator to the prey, you should pray for the weak
Spray out Caprices, drive by with the reaper
I hang out the window like I'm an AC
Bodies turn cold after losing your pulse
Turn that dude to a ghost like the homie SP
Yeah, from the LOX with these bars I keep locked
Ain't a prison, I'm free, I can rap in my sleep
Dude on the post with rocks using shots
They come back to your ass like an offensive rebound
Funeral home on the speed dial, when God call your number
Man, trust me, there won't be no re-dial
We out here every day, they acting senile
Year of the Wolf, niggas 'bout to hear me howl
This beat I'mma wreck hard as gorillas beat on their chest
West swing, I'm knocking their trees down
So go in your temple
These niggas is dinner from January all the way to December
Shouldn't have played with my killers

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Real trill nigga with a hairpin trigger
I’m surrounded by the killers, I just got it like that
Rappers always talking “you ain’t ‘bout it like that"
I went out the hood to get it then I brought it right back
Blood money rider, keep the chopper right beside 'em
F&N fully loaded, that’s for any nigga want it
This sound like I got the shit perfected don’t it?
Grab a cartrige, get to sparkin a targetin like all of my opponents
Raise these haters up off of me, talk some cash when you talk to me
I ain’t got no love for you if you ain’t getting gwap with me
All my niggas from day one who I’m gon take to the top with me
And this shotty on me, got that boy walkin so awkwardly
I was raised in the wild with them lions and tigers
Nothing but paper excite us, bitch we were born to be fighters
And I’m from BME, the G in me won’t let me back down
Underground king without a crown, how I sound?

[Hook][Verse 1]
I heard home is where yo' heart is
Coward where yo' heart at?
Million dollar calls baby doll can't get no call back
In this bitch in all black
Homies roll in strong packs
Inglewood on every song
Boy that's where I got grown at
And I owe that cause that's mine
Bitch I'm on my grind
When I had that time I ain't have no money
Now that I got money man I ain't got time
Speak my mind, make it hard to confuse me with these others
Not a friend in the world
All these niggas with me my brothers yeah
Talk is cheap, broke niggas speak
To the game pay day is 7 days a week
This game bitter but dammit the money sweet
Holla at me when it's G I'm on the top floor sleep

[Hook]
If I don't know nothin' man I know I put on
Been around the map and now I'm headed home
I'm just playin' my position
Cause it's right where I belong
I came to take it all
Now I'm headed home yeah
And nigga if I wasn't rappin' baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Chrome and shinin'sippin' daily
No rest until they pay me
I'm just playin' my position
Cause it's right where I belong
No rest until they pay me
I came to take it all
Now I'm headed home

[Verse 2]
They want me gone, they want me gone
But I keep on I ain't worried bout the bullshit
I'm in my zone
I guess that's why I'm here
And I can't go back home
But guess when I heard that?
When I was back home
I built this on my own nigga
So ain't no hand outs you got to get ya own nigga
101 all these wannabes is clones nigga
Gangsta in the flesh, modern day Capone nigga
You see I grew up a screw up
2 cups got me screwed up

[Hook]


[Outro]
Now I'm home
And it ain't take long
I ain't worried bout shit
Got a O of that strong
While I'm writin' these songs
Nigga look what I did
Do it like Pac or I do it like BIG
Notorious, L, or Pun
Tune in every time that the big homie say look here
Lil' nigga let me tell you somethin'
Know where I'm goin'
Know where I'm headed
Watchin' me win
That's makin' em jealous
This is to you and ain't shit you could tell us
Ain't got to fuck wit' us
Still got to feel it
Livin' the life that these rappers embellish
Boy I'm the shit
I know you can smell
This is groundbreakin' I know that you felt it
And I can get rich off this game that I'm sellin' yeah[Intro]
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
High level so me and all ya'll not

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Right
Stepped in this bitch, whole outfit lookin like a freak show
Still kick game, man this be the flow I make bread off
If you ain’t getting money then don’t get involved
Better leave me alone, you be better off
I been getting money, ain’t set and ya'll spittin that Rico shit that like a bubble off aye
Red dots for the head shot
Yeah the boy kinda short but the bread not
And I fly through the bench, I’mma fuck till I’m rich
I’mma give her that dick and a finger, ho look
Like hell I’m supposed to do with all this work?
I’mma need a kick stand for all this purp
Back when you tumbling papers in trash
I was pushing something foreign, 2-20 on the dash like

[Hook]
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
Look at me, man you starin at dough
I hear what ya'll on, no comparing that though
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Stepped in this bitch, whole outfit lookin like a millie oh for really though?
Can’t get to where I’m at, now these silly hoes studying my motion in my videos
Purse worth bands so it’s only right I got it
Know the haters watchin', I could give a damn about 'em
Swear I got a pair of heels longer than your dick
If your money work magic, my pussy do tricks
Getting million dollars out of rap like it’s Mossie bitch
Got 'em going down under on some Aussie shit
I’m the baddest bitch, boy no argument
And if you ain’t with that business then who are you with?
If I’m ridin would you know that I could change your life
But don’t be going dubbie dubbie tryna change my name
Cause I’m on the top floor where the feelings ain’t allowed
If the Igg do it big tell me how you love me now
New classic

[Hook]
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
Look at me, man you starin at dough
I hear what ya'll on, no comparing that though
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Still in the war with a rap jet
Dunkin' at some pussy you ain’t tapped yet
I don’t give a damn bout none of ya'll niggas
AK got a shot in for everyone ya'll niggas aye
Did my money on European time now
New Rolls and a penthouse nigga
My suspicion niggas always snitchin'
And that’s why I never be around niggas
Put the word on the tape
Best kept secret, I speak it with no debate
They say you got it first, getting love and lover's hate
So even if you don’t know shit you know it’s straight
My brother had a case and he did that time
And I am my brother’s keeper so his problems is mine
Fully loaded clip, you want a problem with mine?
Go hard nigga, put it all on the line like

[Hook]
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
Look at me, man you starin at dough
I hear what ya'll on, no comparing that though
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level[Verse 1: Game]
I got a black mac and a six pack
I don't work out, I don't chit chat
My bitch bad, I get racks
That Rolls Royce, come gift-wrapped
Them birds still come shrink-wrapped
I'm not strapped, don't think that
I'm low key with that click clack
That rat a tat tat tat tat
Throw the burner and I'm runnin' home
Niggas stop being loyal when the money gone
Still walk in this bitch, I'm a hundred strong
One chain on my neck, feel like I got a hundred on
Look at my flow on this bitch
Platinum and gold on my wrist
Money, the accountant be countin' it
That's why I'm throwin' this shit
I'm in BK with that SK
Same clothes since yesterday
With that Biggie Smalls on replay
And I ain’t wearing no vest today
I do the Shmoney dance with this mac
You better do it too or get Shmurda’d
I be grilling that beef, I ain’t talkin’ no burgers
I finna be walkin’ like I’m a New Yorker
I let off the K and then I hop in the Uber
It’s never a question that I am the shooter
I empty the clip and lay you in a pool of
Blood, see how he got hit with the Ruger?
Blood, bandana that’s how we be movin’
Blood, swooping from Compton to Brooklyn
And this ain’t the Barclays but niggas be shootin’

[Hook: Bobby Shmurda] (x2)
Running niggas down back and forth
I’m like pass the torch, blast it off
Niggas making bets so who gonna blast him off?
First to score
We gon’ hit 'em hard, we gon’ hit 'em all
First to score
We gon’ hit 'em all, we gon’ hit 'em hard

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Running cocaina back and forth, copped the bag of salt
E-S to the G-N, I’m the boss dropped the package off
Coming for the murder, masks is off
Bitch you took a loss
Fuck the D.E.A. we shook ‘em off
Bitch we shook ‘em off
Shook and twist the jars
And dope on my momma's stove top
By the time she came back from church boy
I bet you I had an O stocked
In the middle of the muhfuckin' day
No more yayo, boy I done sold out
Nigga pull up in a mothafuckin’ foreign
On forgies that’ll bring them hoes out
Like yeah nigga, niggas keep beggin’
I pull out a pump in this bitch like I’m blizzard
Yeah, empty your pockets, we robbin’
These bitches got all of us trippin’
Nigga, it’s better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission
You catchin’ the hollow, I’m catchin’ you slippin'
I did it alone, only God as my witness
My nigga got off cause we tied up the witness
And made sure the nigga couldn't show up in court
You know the business, them niggas find out that you snitchin'
Them niggas gon' be at your throat
Everyday Halloween niggas will go trick or treatin'
With two twenty-three at your door
Flippin' a check off this rappin'
Go back to the trap and put that in the weed and the blow like

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Skeme]
I just caught a body like a week ago
These hatin' niggas want attention, I don't see 'em though
You talk that gangsta shit, but I just can't believe it bro
We pull up with them shots, knockin' out that European BOOM!
S to the K to the E-M-E
Callin' the EMT after I empted this clip
I sold my dope right on CMT
I'm at the ING, know I'm as weird as it gets
Chuck Taylor told me it's fuck haters
So I say fuck 'em and bury these niggas in pits
Rolley on wrist, no tock or no tick
Your girl on my dick, man come get your bitch
Niggas think this a rap now
I might back down and come try your luck
Riders with me be wired up
They ridin' with me till the tires bust
Haters talkin' but they better cool it
Before that nigga Crooked get fired up
Lay you out like my Balmains
You gotta play 'em straight, he get ironed up
Drinkin' lean till I'm high enough
I don't give a fuck about nan nigga
I ain't squashin' shit, I won't call it off
I just handle mine like a man nigga
I'm on frontline with these bands nigga
Need a chair, I can't stand niggas
We do walk-by's and hop outs
Got slidin' doors on that van nigga

[Hook] (x2)[Hook: TeeFlii]

You, your body looking right
I'm trying to fuck with you
You know what I wanna do
Let me hit it from the back
Let me hit it from the back
If you want it girl then let me
Hit it from the back
Can I hit it from the back?

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]

Annie get it, get it, get it

Ridin' up and down on me, on me
Ridin' up and down on me, on me
Ridin' up and down on me

[Hook: TeeFlii]

[Verse 3: Skeme]

She don't kiss and tell I can do my thing with her
She with all the turn-ups let the gang get her
Say her nigga do it good I do it way better
Gimme that pussy I'mma beat it like Mayweather
Aye, 12 rounds in a ring like a prize fight
Check the Rollie I'm just trynna get the time right
Lean in my cup, ass in my lap
Told her I don't ever front I'd rather smash from the back
She like "fuck them other niggas" cause she want a real nigga
I could have her bustin' like my finger on the trigger
Tell a bitch don't come if she ain't with the business
Murder that pussy, call a judge and a witness
