[Intro:]
Who’s got the power?
(PRo inhales)

[Verse 1: PRo]
The key to life: money, power, respect
Louie this, Gucci that, two private jets
Big money, big business, watch that paper stack
Treat life like a game, it ain't pool but I'm racked
Up, big bucks, no whammies
I swear I prolly lump somebody head for a Grammy
My heart black as the Lambo Kim bought for Kanye
And I ain't frontin', I'm just telling ya’ll what God say
Blood thirsty
Seek my own will since the day that Adam cursed me
The lust for power go to ya’ brain if you let it
You say, “What up, dog?” I hear “God.” I'm so dyslexic
Sit on the throne, it's really a toilet, heart is septic
I have no power, I get handed death, I must accept it
It's hard to see the light when you never listen
Our whole life’s blacked out, the power's trippin'

[Hook x2: Lecrae & Andy Mineo]
Who’s got the power?
(Do you really want it all, whole world in ya’ palm, tell me...)
Who’s got the power?
(It’ll make you a leader or a tyrant, you do the decidin’)


[Verse 2: Lecrae]
It was all a dream
I grew up readin’ hip-hop magazines
Double-XL got me wantin' to excel
They tellin’ me it ain’t hard to tell, I rock well
And now with every sale I'm feelin’ my head swell
Well, I'm a genius in my dreams
Even if I was, it was stitched inside my genes
I’m self-inflated, self-infatuated
And somehow I convinced myself I finally made it
The truth is I was made like the mob
Geppetto put me together; my strings lead to God
Pride come befo’ the fall, I seen it in the script
So if you see me fallin’, prolly a power trip

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Welcome to the culture where humility is not allowed
They do it big, if you don’t see that, you Shallow Hal
Tryna show them how love and power, it goes together
If they call us losers, that just means we last forever
I been connected to the power, I don’t have to chase it
I roll with the Trinity, this is sorta the Matrix
A hard pill to swallow: we’re evil to the core
Wicked power exploits the poor, and it brings war
Power can be a field of dreams loaded with land mines
We know the ruler so you can’t say these are bad lines
(You might lust for that power!), but don’t forget that we’re forgiven
I know the Lord gon’ catch me when I’m power trippin’

[Verse 4: Andy Mineo]
Who made the crowd put they hands in the sky? Me
Who made the sky with they hands? What if y'all can't see?
This is kinda strange, God makes the weather change
And we braggin’ up on our change like "look how we make it rain!"
We Invictus, this sin sickness is in us
Running a muck and 'causin' that mischief, tell me this then, “Who could really fix us?”
I'm, trippin’ to think that I'm really not limited in this position I'm sitting in
Gravity pulling me back to earth gradually, reality's hittin’

(Who's got the power?)[Verse 1: Propaganda]
When it's apparent that you failed as a parent
Too busy tryna pay rent
Homie now what?
Long gone are the days
You ain't takin yo little big head
To A-SO scrimmages no more
No football practice lil league movie nights no
You drive him too his cute little puppy love's girlfriend's doctor's appointment
She got a date with a sonogram
Your boy is officially a statistic - now what?
Your lil man, He barely sproutin' peach fuzz
He wanna be just like you
He writes poetry
He fill kin the Buffalo soldiers you chuckle
We live in the Suburbs
I work too hard for you to not struggle
You don't know what you talkin' about
You soon find that socio-economic status does nothing for a skin color
To them he just a well dressed coon, who's parents got lucky
He's the butt of subliminal jokes
Like his friends refer to rap as jungle jive
They see him and go "Yo Homie Yo!" That's how ya'll talk right?
He's checked out
He's found other outlets
His good grades don't fix his
Depraved brain
He believes the gospel of Young Money - YOLO
Yo, and as Your mommy drops you off at the mall remember as you spoke about them Dunks
And every bite you take of that number 1, animal style is a bite
You stole from your daughters tummy
Them Dunks is about a month's worth Of diapers and food you finna put on your feet
Homie this is your fault
Your job
Your responsibility
Don't get mad when momma won't give ya 20 bucks
It's your turn, I don't know what to tell you
I ain't got an answer

[Hook]
I ain't got an answer (x3)
When it's apparent, that you have failed as a parent
Homie I ain't got an answer
Man I ain't got an answer
Homie I ain't got an answer
I don't know

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
It's apparent sometimes I think I've failed as a parent
And my son Having autism is rough
But maybe he don't speak because words don't say much
Maybe he don't need words to communicate his love
And sometimes his silence causes me to stumble
It's possible he's a version of me that's more humble
And I think my child finds more joy in playin with my phone
Than playin on his own
Will he she'd a tear when I'm gone?
I'm wrestling with the shame of an outsider view of me, cause life is the spotlight, and
Eyein' in on securities. But I know his laugh, it lights up a thousand
Rooms. And when he speaks to me it just like a flower blooms. This has just
Become my own visual diary. I'm at the doctor's office just hopin they
Would lie to me. That my son would be alright
But if he's not, my son would be alright. because he is God's
Autism, Sickle Cells, or Down Syndrome
Still keepin the faith in the midst of hard livin'
We stand together cause We have no other place to go
My son and I we live and fight even tho...

[Hook]
I ain't got an answer (x3)
When it's apparent, that you have failed as a parent
Homie I ain't got an answer
Man I ain't got an answer
Homie I ain't got an answer
I don't know

[Verse 3: Propaganda]
When it's apparent that you have failed As a parent
You cancel a quinceanera, cause lil mamas finna be one
Scroll through your iPhone and unopened emails
How many daughters hugs Did I not reply too?
You ain't lyin to me I know that song that you sing
And that promise ring was real cute but it's really for the parents
She Ain't savin it for marriage
And never had plans too
She in a fetal position
Now carrying a fetus
Your worldly efficiently has left the Philosophical is layin in your living room considering abortion.
Them Eighth grade boys is textin naked pictures and your daughter to each other
Now what?
And baby girl them is yo panties as his Facebook picture, now what?
This is Your fault and I ain't got an answer
Dad sit in it, soak in it, stew in It
You failed
Better get it together boy she needs you more than ever
And I ain't got an answer

[Outro]
It's like that moment when you realize the pinnacle, and modern psychology has failed you. At the end of modern psychology homie. All that junk, it fails. And yo little girl, yo little boy he ain't the person you trained him to be. Look, I don't know. Man, I
Don't know, I don't know the answer. Sho, you know? (I ain't know.) Homie look all that stuff we gotta get our heads outs the sand homie. Life is happenin with our children. Look I'm not the answer, this album, this song, these records they ain't yo answer. I don't know the answer. But I know, I know who got the answer. And let's all point to the savior together boy! Look I ain't perfect - neither is you. But let's look to the man that knows it. I'll walk with you boy I promise you. Pray for me, I'll pray for you. Let's raise our kids boy, we don't have to may models out there. I know like you know Let's set a new standard for fathers. Let's be there for our kids[All]
MAN UP!

Lecrae:
Momma want some more Obama in me the hood want PAC hip hop wanna see the
Common in me. And since this a senseless contradiction I end up a misfit tryina fit In
This ends when I stand up and see the hands of the standard: holy is
The lamb huh(holy is the lamb) Now we holding you to man up cause we were made
In his image start looking at what you came from

[KB]
Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy had to make adamant after what
Adonai is against. Let me take you back to the tree in Eden
If you read it you'll see that eve was deceived but Adam is the one who let it in
(Man up) Standing Leading no, we ain't leading we (Bump that) Basically little boys with
Muscles and a mustache! The femininity, we need a remedy, the God-Man, a
100 percent (strength) masculinity

[Trip Lee]
Where the men at, seems like they all lost, none of them are on the scene
Seems like they died off. They extinct but my dream is to rise up, we
Chasing the prize of the King the divine boss, but we fell away, now we
UnGodly we lose and we really got the blues like Navi
I wanna celebrate the dudes that's beside me fellas lets elevate we through with the lobby

[Tedashii:]
Go ahead I say boy Get your shine on. and if a sucker try to block you get your 9 home and
What I heard you gotta do to be a man now, stand up for yourself so I took
It in my hands now. And that's the problem man we busy trying to solve it
All the while we walking dead man somebody bring the coffin, voice drop
Peach fuzz now you think that your a man cause you feeling yourself you
Need to man up!

[Sho Baraka]
Sex and models, and tipping bottles back a pile of excuses right next to
Your bottle caps. A rolodex filled with names that you aim to
Please next to the stack of money, building up a heart of greed. Ice on his
Neck give the jokers a cold shoulder, you drunk off pride plus you loving
The hangover. You gotta whole lotta stuff that won't amount to gain life
Will never make sense cause you never made change

[PRo]
You got it Twisted sick like a fever, little man live to stack dough
Keebler. Man up! Get up out of the treehouse leave the cookies alone it's
Time to eat meat now. Trying to show you a new way to live now, no charge
You can call it a freestyle. without Christ you know how your man is, you
A boy in a mans body like Tom Hanks in BIG

[Andy Mineo]
Being a man got nothing to do with age. You can be a boy till the day you
Lay in your grave. None of us behave like the image of who were made, cause
We've fallen away it's better known as depraved. Running from
Responsibility really we crave the easy way out of places that call us to
Pull our weight. Man there going through everyday decisions are made
Responding to the call God's giving em from the...

[All]
Man Up!
Andy:
Let the process begin, separate the boys from the men
[All]
Man Up!
[Andy:]
It-it-it don't matter how you started, partner, it's about how you end
[All]
Man Up!
[Andy]
Jesus is the model follow us we gon' follow him
[All]
Man Up!
[Andy]
We-we the last of a dying breed it's time that we

[All]
MAN UP![Hook]
I feel I’m trapped in a crazy place
Asking the Lord for amazing grace
I see the masses wanna change me
I’m waiting for someone to save me
Until then, until then
Well I guess im stuck here on nigga island
Where niggas be wilin’
And color is violence
Moment of silence
[X2]

[Verse 1]
(Yeah)
I am the invisible man
Though I have a soul
I am from an invisible land
They gave me a slave pen
For my freedom of speech
Yeah I’m trying to leave the island
But swimming through bleach
“C’mon son why you always ruin the mood?
Race talks happen every time you enter the room.”
There’s ignorance in the masses
Too many people think racism is past tense
We fight for blackness
But we don’t know what Black is
I know it ain’t the zero sum of white men
They wanna know how to reach the hood like there’s magic
Like we’re all the same
Like we’re not dynamic
Hollywood wants to pimp us to get dough
Exploit us, but give us money
Somebody say “Ho!”
Let’s thank them movies and them TV shows
Be a token or I’ll play an Uncle Tom role
Or be a magic negro until the day I’m gone
Help the white man reach his goal
But never reach my own
Or an oversexed male
Even a coon
A young man who loves ignorance
Praising his doom
Until then…

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Say hello to the great cultural brainwash
Washing my brain from some of the things that race taught
Miseducate
Colonize, divide
Teach beauty in straight hair
In the bluest of eyes
And because of lies, I’m debating five percenters
How the mideast movement gon be a white man’s religion?
How a privileged man gon say it’s time to move forward
And say the game’s fair when he monopolize the board?
And corporate greed just manipulates the poor
Outside the hood, I don’t see liquor stores
I know God is sovereign and I should pray about it
But a man won’t stop it, if it increases his profits
And most
Ain’t realistic with the flow
They make music for the streets, but I don’t see ‘em at the show
So
Instead of truth, they’d rather be duped
I guess they want me to make more songs for youth groups
Until then

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I got a double consciousness, but I’m still in touch
Cops got my hands in the air, so I ain’t feeling much
Lookin for protection, all I can see is tyrants
I’m fighting them coons and thugs, some racists and Don Imus
That lady you call ho (yeah)
That’s my lover
That woman you call bitch (yeah)
That’s my mother
Them boys that you killed
Them my brothers
Send the ship to the island, we can rescue some others
Did they fight for civil rights so we could sit on gold?
I can’t walk in your shoes, you keep sellin your sole
No
Ain’t much Booker T when you look at me
But a whole lot of Dubois making noise
Until then

[Hook]

[Outro]
Here we are, put on a show
Dance a jig, go Jim Crow
Here we are, put on a show
Dance a jig, go monkey go
Here we are, put on a show
Dance a jig, go Jim Crow
Go Jim Crow say go Jim Crow
Go Jim Crow, say go monkey go
That’s what you want me to do, right?
(Are you entertained?)[Intro]
Yeah
(A born again hooligan only to be king again)

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
The key to life, money, power, respect
Louie this, Gucci that, two private jets
Big money, big business, watch that paper stack
Treat life like a game, it ain't pool but I'm racked up
Big bucks, no whammies

(It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine)
They tellin’ me it ain’t hard to tell, I rock well

[Outro]
I've got the power trip (x4)[Hook 1: Ali (Sho Baraka)]
I'm tryin' to be great and I'm on my way
Way up, way up, way up
It's never too late and I'm on my way
(I'ma leave my mark, ready set go
Ready set go, ready set go)

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Hello greatness I'm here to greet you
False humility and doubt had me scared to meet you
Fear had me I couldn't sleep I lay awake
Felt like I had to put my dreams up on layaway
That's the thoughts of a kid living on welfare
Section 8 monthly food stamps government healthcare
Depressed hopin' adulthood would suck less
From our house we had a poor view of success
Let it be told all that glitters ain't gold
Life is a slam dunk when you livin' with low goals
Pick and roll with a number of great friends
Some want you to be great but not greater than them
Never lust for the top, love it's a long fall
Climbed the ladder of success on the wrong wall
It's by working faith, it's the Lord's grace
Mediocre is contagious, give me some space, space

[Hook 1: Ali]

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Ha, I'm like hold up can I dream?
Everybody's dreaming but not me
Imago Dei His masterpiece is so vivid
You know the architect homeboy we in the buildin'
No ceiling prayers tear the roof off
Talk to God via text you got a new call
Fans will exalt ya, haters wanna stone ya
Man will always fail ya keep ya eyes on Jehovah
I'm sayin' great I'm trying to push my brothers
Talented tenth, that service for the good of others
Some know a lot, say a lot with no application
Success' mistress is procrastination
Greatness is like Bach on the keys, Ali in the ring
Like King havin' a dream
Huh, it's like Mueller on his knees, Tolstoy with a pen
A Messiah without sin

[Hook 2: Ali (Sho Baraka)]
Hello faith, goodbye doubt
I met greatness on my way out
Never give up, never give up, never give up
Hello faith, goodbye doubt
I met greatness on my way out
Never give up, never give up, never give up

[Hook 1]

I'm tryin' to be great and I'm on my way
Way up, way up, way up
It's never too late, I know I'll be great[Intro: Swoope]
Yeah, we live as kings
With the living King
Yeah, we live as kings

[Verse 1: Swoope]
We're comfortable to share in His glory along with some other things
It's only right to share with Jesus Christ in His sufferings
Suffer well, as a co-heir
Even if you suffer hell knowin' you ain't goin' there
Got the spirit of sonship, we're sayin' Abba
And sin where we once lived, we're sayin' bye-bye
Was once inglorious bastards
But we'll be in glorious baskers

[Hook: Swoope]
If we go through the pain with Him, pain with Him
Then we, we gon' reign with Him, reign with Him
The saying is no pain, no gain
But it's really no pain, no reign
Oh, yeah, we live as kings
Oh, yeah, with the living King

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
The most excellent offering is all things
Given often to the majestic offspring
Exalt Him, humbled hearts and bowed necks
It's high livin' and we ain't left the ground yet
This is food for thought, fed by my lyrics
Scripture controls my pencil I'm led by the Spirit
Redeeming the world that became ugly
When the sky cracks above me every tribe and country will be doin' the Dougie

[Verse 3: Christon Gray]
Slow step stride and to the tune of the pride of life
Like sheep led to the slaughter, Delilah's daughters
And sons of Baal, worshipping their man-made altars
Money made the man turn monster, not us
Christ the King will always be our mantra
Arrow on that narrow road just tyrin' to keep my posture
The Kingdom sufferin' violence, still
But greater is the King that's inside us, kneel

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Alex Faith]
It's much more than purple robes and gold rings
But a crown of thorns cuz life is a short dream
Grindin' then we die, until we reign from high
We endure the pain and then we meet Him in the sky
I'm just another stone in the crown of a king
Reigning, we're slaves freed, before the throne sing
This is stuff from dreams I can't believe in what I see
He only gave us crowns so we can put 'em at His feet

[Outro]
Oh
Yeah, we live as kings
With the living KingVerse 1
What I look like caring if the world don’t feel us
I serve a God who died harder than Bruce Willis
Man’s born sick and he just gets ill’er
In our optimistic prime he could transform a killer
He could transform a dealer, ask Json
We were all born sinners ask my mom
My nature’s no better than Judas and that’s the truth
Without the Spirit I’m an arrogant adulterous dude
So I keep accountability until I get old
Tedashii said, “Bring the heat cuz the world’s so cold!”
I gotta live 100 so my feet don’t slip
I gotta live like Jacob more holy less hip
By his grace Sho Baraka gone spit the real
Been doing that Reach life before I got the deal
Called to make mini-me's til the day that I die
So on my tombstone say, “he didn’t die he multipled"

Hook
I gotta keep it (100)
My men keep it (100)
My ladies keep it (100)
We gotta keep it (100)

Verse 2
Back in the year of the 2 triple O
This random thug tried to strong arm the Sho
Me and my boys on the corner just sharing our faith
This cat staring at us like he got something to say
He began to size us up acting tough talking loud
I tried to ignore him but this fool attracted a crowd
I expected some resistance but this ain't what I wanted
I had 99 problems this made 100
He looked me in the face and said if you love that Christ
You’ll have no problem with me sending you to see him tonight
I’m thinking option number one is we can turn the other cheek
Number 2 is we can stomp his loud mouth in the street
But that’s what they want to see us fail when they test us
Talk a good game but then crack under pressure
So I prayed to GOD, if I gotta take this L
I hope out of this you would get your glory as well
So this cat stared at us for a second or two
Jumped at us and smirked like I’m playing with you
We had to represent the Lord even though they were stuntin
No matter what they do we gotta keep it 100

Hook

They move their lips but their words mean nothing
They think God got their back but them boys just frontin
They talk loud but we can drown out the sickest boys
We like Chicago, willing to make the iller noise
They want toys, fame, wealth and health
Everything good without being good themselves
They want things (Yes they do) but its Jesus they better get
Cuz hell’s their life sentence like a subject and a predicate
Sometimes I see the wicked and I lust for their things
But then I see the Lord and I trust in the King
Hung on the cross for hours while still in his prime
We don’t call him heir for nothing he showing us hang time
He is holy, he is perfect, he is God
God is like three in one, its so odd
Because of all this your boy gotta keep running
99 won't do it gotta keep it 100

Ten spyte van ons lyding en in die midde van ons pyn
Staan daar een wat bekend is met lyding
En Hy's gewilling om vir ons te genees:
Jesus Christus

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Yeah, I feel the pain of a 70's soul singer
Who just saw the death of one of its soul leaders
I wanna sell records but yet I feel eager
To write political tunes that give a certain ﬁnger
To talk to God they told me to climb a mountain
I'm thirsty for His revelation, where's the colored fountain?
As grace rains on the concrete garden
I guess it's common sense now that that's water for chocolate
Mommas tried to keep their babies off the street
Police got rap sheets so ya kids gettin' beat, beat
Hit after hit video in the crowd and still not enough evidence
I'm on my Harriet Tubman maybe my sojourner
More like Martin Luther the King than Nat Turner
I roll with a team of newly redeemed sinners
That know we have to lose our life to be winners (live)

[Hook]
Clouds will come the rain will fall
Sometimes sun won't shine at all
From pain inside cries will soar
But I'm hopin' that you hold all things together

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Yeah, every pastor ain't corrupt, every church don't suck
But the people are thinkin', who will speak for us?
A nation of people who bleach their skin
Keep ﬁghtin' my bro, you'll ﬁnd that peace within
Or that young brown sister with a pure gold voice
Or that unborn child who has had no choice
Third world pains, kids dyin' of aids
Abort a child cuz 2 adults had childish ways
Pretty offensive - I'm still in the zone
I have a Chris Rock goal - keep my daughter off the pole
That's two-fold - stripping and politickin'
Cuz to me homie I don't really see much difference
Promise a bunch of stuff you never get
Exit with the same concerns you came in with
To all my people who grindin' - what up tho'?
To all my people who dyin' - what up ghost?
To all my people who grindin' - what up tho'?
To all my people who dyin' - what up ghost?

[Hook]
Clouds will come the rain will fall
Sometimes sun won't shine at all

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Born in Alberta, died in Atlanta
Had 2 parents plus raised by grandma
Told I was different cuz I spoke with a grammar that was proper
Cuz my momma tried to raise me with manners
I'm a lover, I'm a husband, I'm an artist, I'm a father
I'm a ﬁghter, a believer, I'm an actor, I'm an author
I ran up son of Adam, I'm just lookin' for the pardon
A vegan avoidin' the beef that started in the garden
I'm on my Oscar Grant and invisible children
Jena Six, Rakeem Boyd, I am Bobby Tillman
I'm on my thief on the cross the prodigal son
And I was the sheep that was lost
I'm on my mover and shakers a student of the panthers
Also learned in the quakers
I'm on my Zora Neale, Absalom Jones
Harlem renaissance with a Paul Robeson poem
I'm on my George Washington Carver
A humble servant who gave all glory to the Father
I'm on my Rembrandt with a ﬁtted cap, C.S. Lewis if he would ever rap
I'm on my Lord touch down, I love life but you can come back now
I'm on my son of a king, a fresh prince, diverse being, the talented 10th

[Outro]

To all my people who grindin' - what up tho'?
To all my people who dyin' - what up ghost?

Oh wherever you came from give my regards
Somebody made a work of art
And I just think it's so bizarre that I'm in the picture
So for better or for worse I'm seeking the Lord
Sometimes it's back to the drawing board
But I won't give up 'til I'm sure it's a perfect picture

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Okay, meet Claire, ha, she says she's single and content
She says she ain't lookin' for a man but we know she really is
Prayin' makin' a list of things her husband needs to ﬁt
A fit 10 who loves the Lord, she won't settle for no 6
Oh well, let me introduce you to a 6 named Cliff
He ain't Adonis, but then again Claire ain't even a goddess
Million dollar smile with some 50 dollar pockets
He got a killer charm and he been walkin' with the Lord
They get introduced and then they have a couple dates
And after months of bein' fake I guess they get sick of the chase
After counsel and growth Cliff goes shoppin' for a ring
Spits a little game at her like "won't you be my queen?"
She wants a big weddin' which means spendin' big bucks
He's thinkin' of future expenses he wants to save up
Mom told her be submissive baby, don't be contentious
Be quick to listen baby girl, your words can be vicious
Father told him never stop datin' your wife
The honeymoon is one night, she needs good sex her whole life
What God has put together, let no man tear apart
They have their whole life in front of 'em and this is just the start

[Hook: Christon Gray]
Oh wherever you came from give my regards
Somebody made a work of art
And I just think it's so bizarre that I'm in the picture
So for better or for worse I'm seeking the Lord
Sometimes it's back to the drawing board
But I won't give up 'til I'm sure it's a perfect picture

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Okay, chapter 2, Cliff and Claire have a new situation
New child, new career, they need new patience
It's a different place in life cuz it's a different marriage
They need new expectations now that they've become parents
Cliff wants the wife with the shape of his wedding day
Claire wants more help with the child and a more servant mate
Well since he ain't gettin' sex, and she ain't gettin' served
They both do small things to work each other's nerves
Because of debt and school loans and the house they own
He keepin' up with the Jones's, this brother's never home
The things that caught her eye she used to like but she don't like no mo
The jokes that came out of his mouth well now she hopes he keeps it closed
So when he works he ﬂirts and he gets attention from the boss's assistant
This is causin' some tension
She complains so much, man he really starts to hate it
Her words are cuttin' him deep so he feels emasculated
This makes Cliff very passive but also quite aggressive
They both are stressin' cuz their marriage is depressin'
They've given up on the portrait it's back to the drawing board
They need the right frame of reference so they can paint some more

[Hook: Christon Gray]
Oh wherever you came from give my regards
Somebody made a work of art
And I just think it's so bizarre that I'm in the picture
So for better or for worse I'm seeking the Lord
Sometimes it's back to the drawing board
But I won't give up 'til I'm sure it's a perfect picture

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
(Okay, chapter 3)
After seein' that their selfish ways were really only hurtin'
They ain't perfect but the couple is workin' with counsel
Seein' Jesus and other couples as the model
Dyin' to serve each other is the paint brush to follow
Who would think to love somebody as bad as us
Love ain't love unless it can be taken advantage of
Love's a commitment at my expense for your benefit
It's a call to action even when the server ain't feelin' it
I think they know now, they've learned to surround
Themselves with other married couples and lay aside the crown
Cliff learned how to cheat his job and not cheat his wife
Changing his expectations and prioritize his life
Claire learned that small things can cause great fights
She's trying to serve in spite of and not serve in spite
If anything we could model our great hero
Always give 100 percent and expect zero[Hook: Sho Baraka & Derek Minor]
I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm a truth carrier, barbarian
Hands to the plow how they bury me no fear in me
Years ago, I be up in a dim lit hole screaming, Woah!
As the reefer blow and the liquor pour
On a line of white unafraid to fight stand proud
For a crowd of the devil's children talking loud
Then Pow! the Spirit gave birth to a child
Now you don't know me and you don't know my style
Courageous as I make the sacrifice live selfless
Follow Christ through the dark valley where the death is
Reject sin kill the lion stomp around Jericho
Ram's horn blow, serpent's head crush death blow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
They want me under that system hunting that
Good life, hood life just like all them other cats
They want me scared man I'm gonna snap
They want me following a lot of them but I ain't hearing of none of that
Running back, look I ain't gotta follow fools
And I ain't gotta follow crews that don't like to follow rules
Ain't gotta try to follow all them hundred dollar dudes
Naw, bruh that ain't my motto and I know I gotta choose
They tell me to rebel and well I ain't enthused
By opposing my creator cause I know that I would lose
Just cause I'm a dude don't mean I need Glocks
I think they got the flu cause they think they need shots
We stop tryna chase them we much rather know Him
We can't see the sun (Son) then a storm finna blow in
We tryna be courageous, let His word soak in
We got that free admission we bout to go in

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
All creation will be shaken and hearts will be racing
They'll be waiting for the judge and His opening statement
They show courage in the wrong ways
Before I move to Atlanta I knew some real braves
These cowards run the world, I guess they legs are tired
So now they sit in the throne that the Lord desired
We trust in our hero that's how we know we're saved
Yeah, He even gives us strength on our weak days
It's a zoo out there, cheetahs driving Jaguars
And most rappers are animals, lyin' in bars
They claim they run the game, they got that money mayne
But my value's eternal I got forever change
I tried not to judge I was defended once
Until I got booked and saw what the sentence was
I find courage in the Spirit in our God alone
I'm not scared of Mick Jagger's rolling with stones

[Hook][Hook]
Inner man right, outer man fresh
The boys got swag, we ain't too impressed
Friends come and go but real men gon' last
We been fresh but we the folks who still got class

We got class, let them boys have swag (Denzel) [x3]
We got class, we got class

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Yo I am chillin' Suzy Rock chillin'
Tryin to be a Godly example for these children
While I'm here I'd like to thank
My pops who taught me faith before he passed away
Can we get a round of applause for gentlemen please
Trying to put an end to swag cuz we are G's
To my father's on they homework cuz class don't end
And other words to some lazy and passive men
To my wife mi amore Sade on Pandora
Mumblin' the verse cuz I only know the chorus
Civil rights defender got service on the agenda
Step outside feelin' like a day for suspenders

[Hook]
Inner man right, outer man fresh
The boys got swag, we ain't too impressed
Friends come and go but real men gon' last
We been fresh but we the folks who still got class

We got class let them boys have swag (Denzel) [x3]
We got class, we got class

[Sho Baraka]
Hands in the air if you like them girls who ain't on TV
Cuz they got mo class
Than the models

[Verse 2: Suzy Rock]
Shout out to the smart girls in college starvin' artists and
Bible freaks what ever they wanna call us
We got class that you can't cash and got a ring that you can't smash
Please fools don't ask
I'm on a mission to be a mogul business is mobile
And I got unlimited texts and sendin' His message global
Makin' ﬁshers of men - check my net worth
Baby I'm talkin' riches 'til ya neck hurt
And I ain't talkin' red bottoms I ain't talkin' bags
I'm talkin' pure hearted inner beauty got class
I'm talkin' modesty honestly she still bad
Cuz she don't think she's sexy cuz she showin' her ass...
Ask me no questions I tell you no lies
I'm just givin' you life, you can like it or not

[Hook]
Inner man right, outer man fresh
The boys got swag, we ain't too impressed
Friends come and go but real men gon' last
We been fresh but we the folks who still got class

We got class let them boys have swag (Denzel) [x3]
We got class, we got class

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Okay havin' class is that one night stand
That took place after that bride and groom dance
He put a ring on it, go and get intimate
Yeah, Songs of Solomon and no censorship
Young boys be saggin' in the mall
How they supposed to be winnin' all I see is they drawers?
I'm in that grateful apparel that bear fruit logo
Yeah you gettin' schooled but I'm still in my play clothes
Svelte already but not yet support a cause and stay fresh
All with the same check
Ah, my society where everything is high
Where class will survive and swag goes to die[Intro]
Don't mean much
It don't mean much to me

[Verse 1: KB]
Yo, so they may be like KB you got it goin' on
In twenty years they'll forget me like Kevin in Home Alone
Sown, grown and blown, mown and then its gone
That's the history of grass, and man ain't much more (Talk about it)
(Hit me) No one will care what you invented
Half the stuff that we use we can care less about the original
Listen, I ain't trippin' I love to lift up inventions
But more than liftin' inventors, who invented the inventor That's God (Talk about it)
My whole clique Christ lovers
My outfit it might be plain, but I'm fly with the (w)right brothers
Life covered, Jesus he saves well
Free's the mind for those doing time in a brain cell
Jesus 'til I expire, I may have a Good Year
Fire stones fall from the sky, I'll never tire
Serious don't use the word play, this consonant word play
Competent conquerin' content content e'rrday

[Hook]
We lost judged
Dead men walking on a dead earth
Looking for a heart and a soul search
Everything I want
It don't mean much
It don't mean much to me
Money, fame
Coming for your heart
Sex, drugs
Secret of the dark
Everything, everything the world wants
It don't mean much
It don't mean much to me

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Yeah, Lord sometimes its envy on my lips, lust on my hips
Feet prone to slip because I'm so weak
We often fake like we're meek, say we're the least, speak deep
But the Lord is like son please
We exaggerate our strengths, hide our mistakes
That's a bad place, cause we only make his grace cheap
When I'm angry my pride wants to slay me
I know one person who needs to take up his cross daily, that's me
Yeah, and our deepest desires might be the worst thing
Our hearts are wicked, you don't know what that curse brings
I get something new then I look at you
If you have one and a little that, I want two, greed
We have peasants mimicking' the life of kings
Yeah you have fame and things, you never had peace
Made in his image, but then we made a mess
Win, lose, or draw, he's a picture of success
Say cheese

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KB]
You make a song about Jesus, you never going to hell
Yeah that's written in the first book of (where was it) nowhere
I know that's no bail , but his fare won't go well
Lord help before our days end, like a hotel
Cause death doesn't care how many albums you sold
And death doesn't schedule like this time or no
Death clock reading it's sooner time to go
But it'll be soon time to go
Choose God and grow
Watch the throne all you want, but it'll never be ya'll seat
The throne's occupied like it's palace on Wall Street
My God so great that He puts great to shame
Ain't a man bad enough, he ain't bad enough to save
Jesus, came here to save the worst of sinners
How you think I'm able to rap these verses with Him
To the earth He entered
Full of mercy in a
Death and the resurrection He got your boy singing

[Hook][Hook]
You need something real
Baby that ain't never gonna last
That's just fool's gold
That ain't treasure that's trash
And I, I know it look nice, I know it look nice
But that's a rip off, for that price?
That ain't treasure that's trash
Cause it ain't never gon' last

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
You spend your time tryna get your claws on
That stuff when we get to heaven we gon' walk on
A problem baby our heart is never satisfied
Clothed to righteousness and still have a naked eye
I struggle my heart always wants more
The only Christ they see on me is Christian Dior
I was a slave to fashion, see my chains
Ralph Lauren and Ed Hardy were my masters' names
Washed by the Father stay clean
I can still be tight without the skinny jeans
I got eternal swag that's the new fashion
I see clearly now through my Sunglasses
I know some sisters who stay shining
You can ask pearl or ask diamond
The real treasure I'm filled with
I know it's deep I hope you can dig this

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Swoope]
You say it's Louis on my two feet
It's ooh ee when I'm through the streets
The cuties say "cute sneaks" and them shoes sweet when the dudes speak
Nothing under a hundred stutting on 'em mean nothing
I'm frontin' but oh they love it
I'm ahead of my class and passing
Got a passion for flashing satisfactions and fashion
Yeah homie I'm a tag popper
Makin' you sick call a swag doctor
These threads is concealing my flaws
For I am fulfilled by applause
I guess pride is my idol now
What I'mma do when these items go out of style?
This ain't treasure it's trash
I know this pleasure won't last
I need that real

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Andy Mineo]
I can't front I like nice kicks and new clothes
I like givin' old school records new flows
I like money that I make when I do shows
But when I abuse those they fool's gold
Now now let me tell you what I mean
I could make something good a God thing
Turn all my wants into needs
Holdin' on to perishing means as supreme
It seems, people want pleasure for a season
Instead of seeking the God who's eternally pleasing
For some reason I thought that I wouldn't be lonely
If I had women all on me
I couldn't buy joy with the paper
My good deeds never bought God's favor
Find my currency faulty
I'm so glad that the Christ came and bought me
Livin' that

[Hook]Half of me just walked away
And the other half is trying not to stay
Help me see the hope that's past the rain
Restore the joy within me and
Speak to me thru the pain

This kind of news would make a grown man cry
The kind of man who knows the answers but he still asks why
Why are you down cast oh my soul
My team expects so much from me, I can't let them know
That I'm not finding joy and my faith's dying slow
I gotta go on preaching I gotta go on with the show
Gotta grace the stage, I gotta make the crowd say oh
Only problem is I'm not believing in the words I flow
So I look to sky I know the hour has come
Please remove this thorn from me cuz my soul feels numb
I got these liars in my head asking where my faiths gone
I don't feel happy and I don't even care to fake for them
They think me showing pain is the denial of Christ
Because my tears up in my food all day and night
Half of me hopes in the Lord and knows I'll praise again
The other half wants an excuse to wallow in my sin
They say count it all joy, I got questions about how
Theres answers after death but I need answers right now
I know this to shall pass, whether slow or fast
Loosen my grip on the world and for you I grasp (2x)

He feels he fled temptation to long, so He's tried of fighting
He no longer finds his marriage exciting
She's drowning in depression in the rain
She can't maintain, Lord can you help her ease the pain
A father gets news that his newborn son has complications
He has no idea what he's faced with
He thinks no prom, no college, no athletic fun
No matter his disabilities I'm not ashamed of my son
Lord I pray with all my heart that when his life on earth is done
He'll understand that you and the son are one
One families prays together for financial needs
Father feels inadequate cuz he ain't worked in weeks
He been laid off he may loose his car and home
He thinks what good is a man who can't provide for his own
He sees the pain in wife and children's eyes
Contemplating suicide cuz dead men don't cry
Lord give him eyes to see past the pain
That his value in life, shouldn't come with things
I know this to shall pass, whether slow or fast
They are losing their grip I hope for you they grasp (2x)

I won't let this current pain master me
What is pain actually
Lets not address it causally but I don't want to fear pain
Lets count it all joy its is gain
Dear life is in my palms and I'm holding on
Strength is an illusion right along with this calm that I'm on and I'm feeling far gone-
Cause half of me is hoping that my eyes won't open in morn'
Sorrow is my tongue hear my moans
I'm eager for redemption but I know
There's more than meets the eye to the thorns in my side
So I cry refusing all the lies
Pain is my ally when aligned to who you are
There's more to my scars so I know there's more to yours
I'm resting in your arms
I'm resting in the your wrists
I'm pressing with a limp pain is purposed through your gift
I'm strengthening my grip may this faith in u persist
And when this half insists I pray u breathe in me lament
Amazing is your grace cause while I'm holding you it seems
The truth of the matter is your really holding me[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Turn my beat up, overdose mine
I don’t need drugs, got the Most High
Holy Ghost writer to compose rhymes
Sin got us blind, got a cloud on our minds
I’m illuminated open up my eyes
Now the Spirit showin me the Word is alive
I was so low, now i’m so high
Regenerated mind telling me that i’m alive
And it’s workin, i’m so certain
Confident He created me for a purpose
Somewhere in-between the jeans that yall jerkin
And them khakis that gansta's work-workin
No purpose sir so worthless
I catch re-real contact when I worship
Hi-high turn the treble, bass-bass up
I’m tryna see the Son that’s why I got my face up!

[Chorus: Natalie Lauren]
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I'mma stand behind my bars like a inmate
And I promise I do the things that my pen say
God’s sensei, I'm in the dojo
I'm crank-cranked up like I’m poppin' no dose
No dose, homie don’t sleep
World full of them sheep with the shark teeth
Don’t don’t start me, on that lighter fluid
Fire brewin', see me shinin' from a (mile or two)
Do it suddenly, can’t even muffle me
Moses off the mountain top you better cover me
Try to smother me? I crank it up some mo'
Love, joy, peace, that’s what i’m bankin' on
Turned up, no I can’t stop
This is rock music, yeah I rep The Rock
I don’t need a buzz, I don’t need to shine
Already sky high, I think I see the top

[Chorus: Natalie Lauren]
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
Turn-turn the treble up, bass on high
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
Turn the treble up, bass on high
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
All my people in the building get cha hands up high
Get em high-i-i-i-high high
Get em high-i-i-i-high-high, high

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
Hello, hand’s high like His name
I been purchased by the blood homie I can show you change
Back in the day I saw a girl (iMac)
Try to get those digits call her later (iChat)
I rehab now got my eyes on the Throne
Whenever I talk to the Lord, iPhone
Yeeeeah, faith on high
He got us standin' up for His Word no lie
Ha, this is detox rhyming
Only pride we love is the pride full of lions
They can’t stop His shine, He so amazing
The Son rose for some daylight savings
He saved us from the beast on Easter
Then build a damnation like a beaver
All men fall short like Keibler
Elf, Gary Coleman, Webster, and Lil' Ceaser

[Chorus: Natalie Lauren]
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
Turn-turn the treble up, bass on high
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
Turn the treble up, bass on high
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
All my people in the building get cha hands up high
Get em high-i-i-i-high high
Get em high-i-i-i-high-high, high[Verse 1: Propaganda]
When it's apparent that you failed as a parent
Too busy tryna pay rent
Homie now what?
Long gone are the days
You ain't takin yo little big head
To A-SO scrimmages no more
No football practice lil league movie nights no
You drive him too his cute little puppy love's girlfriend's doctor's appointment
She got a date with a sonogram
Your boy is officially a statistic - now what?
Your lil man, He barely sproutin' peach fuzz
He wanna be just like you
He writes poetry
He fill kin the Buffalo soldiers you chuckle
We live in the Suburbs
I work too hard for you to not struggle
You don't know what you talkin' about
You soon find that socio-economic status does nothing for a skin color
To them he just a well dressed coon, who's parents got lucky
He's the butt of subliminal jokes
Like his friends refer to rap as jungle jive
They see him and go "Yo Homie Yo!" That's how ya'll talk right?
He's checked out
He's found other outlets
His good grades don't fix his
Depraved brain
He believes the gospel of Young Money - YOLO
Yo, and as Your mommy drops you off at the mall remember as you spoke about them Dunks
And every bite you take of that number 1, animal style is a bite
You stole from your daughters tummy
Them Dunks is about a month's worth Of diapers and food you finna put on your feet
Homie this is your fault
Your job
Your responsibility
Don't get mad when momma won't give ya 20 bucks
It's your turn, I don't know what to tell you
I ain't got an answer

[Hook]
I ain't got an answer (x3)
When it's apparent, that you have failed as a parent
Homie I ain't got an answer
Man I ain't got an answer
Homie I ain't got an answer

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
It's apparent sometimes I think I've failed as a parent
And my son Having autism is rough
But maybe he don't speak because words don't say much
Maybe he don't need words to communicate his love
And sometimes his silence causes me to stumble
It's possible he's a version of me that's more humble
And I think my child finds more joy in playin with my phone
Than playin on his own
Will he she'd a tear when I'm gone?
I'm wrestling with the shame of an outsider view of me, cause life is the spotlight, and
Eyein' in on securities. But I know his laugh, it lights up a thousand
Rooms. And when he speaks to me it just like a flower blooms. This has just
Become my own visual diary. I'm at the doctor's office just hopin they
Would lie to me. That my son would be alright
But if he's not, my son would be alright. because he is God's
Autism, Sickle Cells, or Down Syndrome
Still keepin the faith in the midst of hard livin'
We stand together cause We have no other place to go
My son and I we live and fight even tho...

[Hook]
I ain't got an answer (x3)
When it's apparent, that you have failed as a parent
Homie I ain't got an answer
Man I ain't got an answer
Homie I ain't got an answer

[Verse 3: Propaganda]
When it's apparent that you have failed As a parent
You cancel a quinceanera, cause lil mamas finna be one
Scroll through your iPhone and unopened emails
How many daughters hugs Did I not reply too?
You ain't lyin to me I know that song that you sing
And that promise ring was real cute but it's really for the parents
She Ain't savin it for marriage
And never had plans too
She in a fetal position
Now carrying a fetus
Your worldly efficiently has left the Philosophical is layin in your living room considering abortion.
Them Eighth grade boys is textin naked pictures and your daughter to each other
Now what?
And baby girl them is yo panties as his Facebook picture, now what?
This is Your fault and I ain't got an answer
Dad sit in it, soak in it, stew in It
You failed
Better get it together boy she needs you more than ever
And I ain't got an answer

[Outro]
It's like that moment when you realize the pinnacle, and modern psychology has failed you. At the end of modern psychology homie. All that junk, it fails. And yo little girl, yo little boy he ain't the person you trained him to be. Look, I don't know. Man, I
Don't know, I don't know the answer. Sho, you know? (I ain't know.) Homie look all that stuff we gotta get our heads outs the sand homie. Life is happenin with our children. Look I'm not the answer, this album, this song, these records they ain't yo answer. I don't know the answer. But I know, I know who got the answer. And let's all point to the savior together boy! Look I ain't perfect - neither is you. But let's look to the man that knows it. I'll walk with you boy I promise you. Pray for me, I'll pray for you. Let's raise our kids boy, we don't have to may models out there. I know like you know Let's set a new standard for fathers. Let's be there for our kids[Verse 1]
I know I'm not fit or deserving to do this
But I'm foolish
If I don't spit to give you Godly influence
Like a student
Practice and prudence will you walk with me through this
As I give my feeble attempt at glorifying Yeshua
Cause He
Is the beginning everything came into being
By His being the being who created all other beings
We're MCing
Due to His benevolent freeing, decreeing
He's the almighty creator of everything that we're seeing
There is none like Him
If you don't like Him then He'll use the liking of liking Himself to acquire just to delight Him
That's why I write Hymns
My right hand use to write sin battle 'gainst Him like I was (Shai-lin?)
And now despite sin
I give praise the God who made sunny days
To white lightening
It's quite frightening
To sing "Whose world is this" without proper enlightenment

[Verse 2]
He use intelligent design
Like eloquence confined
Life elements assigned by
Elohim my God
He left his fingerprints
You thinking that our origins are coincidence
Our symmetry alone makes evolution look ridiculous
And since our complexity is more than irreducible
The fact our design had a designer is irrefutable
I use a science tool to make a statement like this
The existence of an atheist proves God exists
He's the owner
Holding the throne
Potent and strong
He smote any foe approaching Him on bolens alone
But since he up-rose he told us to go on this road
Shown my a knowledge foretold
Spoken by prophets of old
The total opposite role
Chosen by populace goes
Down to the hottest abode
Total apocalypse bro
That's why we're rocking it yo
Hand these sounds to the proudest man
God has brought you in this world and he can sure take you out of it

[Verse 3]
You should already know who's running it
Brotha you don't want it
He made it in six but he'll only take one to crumble it
The earth rumbles at the sound of his mumbling
He flooded it once but with Noah he made a covenant
So the next time he's gonna be coming with flames
His antagonists don't know what they're up against
Return of the last Adam who's rapping will smash men now holds together every last atom
And that ain't even the sum of it
Matter of fact you could handle the half I'm only giving you some of it
But it's still enough of it for you to come to grips
With the fact that it's His planet you own none of it
So please consider how dumb it is
To take comfort in the momentary status you have and the stuff you get
He'll blaze it up in the end you can trust it kid
But we ain't bugging cause there's another one coming you dig

[Verse 4]
The earth was so impressed with His defeat of the grave
The ground did the Harlem shake the ocean did the wave
No longer enslaved now that I see the Lord
And God is so deep He causes hurricanes when He brainstorms
I switched teams me and Crae got traded on the same night
Same conference same sermon by James White
The light of Christ is a blazing one
I'm evidence that His Grace is amazing son
Man continues to overvalue his worth
Spends most of his time trying to conquer the earth
That kind of action only leaves you empty or hurt
Then you see your true value when you return to the dirt
$5000 casket, $500 clothes
6 months for the grieving 1 year to decompose
I've yet to find a human who can outlive the curse
While God sits in the Heaven, place his feet on the earth[Hook]
I feel I’m trapped in a crazy place
Asking the Lord for amazing grace
I see the masses wanna change me
I’m waiting for someone to save me
Until then, until then
Well I guess im stuck here on nigga island
Where niggas be wilin’
And color is violence
Moment of silence
[X2]

[Verse 1]
(Yeah)
I am the invisible man
Though I have a soul
I am from an invisible land
They gave me a slave pen
For my freedom of speech
Yeah I’m trying to leave the island
But swimming through bleach
“C’mon son why you always ruin the mood?
Race talks happen every time you enter the room.”
There’s ignorance in the masses
Too many people think racism is past tense
We fight for blackness
But we don’t know what Black is
I know it ain’t the zero sum of white men
They wanna know how to reach the hood like there’s magic
Like we’re all the same
Like we’re not dynamic
Hollywood wants to pimp us to get dough
Exploit us, but give us money
Somebody say “Ho!”
Let’s thank them movies and them TV shows
Be a token or I’ll play an Uncle Tom role
Or be a magic negro until the day I’m gone
Help the white man reach his goal
But never reach my own
Or an oversexed male
Even a coon
A young man who loves ignorance
Praising his doom
Until then…

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Say hello to the great cultural brainwash
Washing my brain from some of the things that race taught
Miseducate
Colonize, divide
Teach beauty in straight hair
In the bluest of eyes
And because of lies, I’m debating five percenters
How the mideast movement gon be a white man’s religion?
How a privileged man gon say it’s time to move forward
And say the game’s fair when he monopolize the board?
And corporate greed just manipulates the poor
Outside the hood, I don’t see liquor stores
I know God is sovereign and I should pray about it
But a man won’t stop it, if it increases his profits
And most
Ain’t realistic with the flow
They make music for the streets, but I don’t see ‘em at the show
So
Instead of truth, they’d rather be duped
I guess they want me to make more songs for youth groups
Until then

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I got a double consciousness, but I’m still in touch
Cops got my hands in the air, so I ain’t feeling much
Lookin for protection, all I can see is tyrants
I’m fighting them coons and thugs, some racists and Don Imus
That lady you call ho (yeah)
That’s my lover
That woman you call bitch (yeah)
That’s my mother
Them boys that you killed
Them my brothers
Send the ship to the island, we can rescue some others
Did they fight for civil rights so we could sit on gold?
I can’t walk in your shoes, you keep sellin your sole
No
Ain’t much Booker T when you look at me
But a whole lot of Dubois making noise
Until then

[Hook]

[Outro]
Here we are, put on a show
Dance a jig, go Jim Crow
Here we are, put on a show
Dance a jig, go monkey go
Here we are, put on a show
Dance a jig, go Jim Crow
Go Jim Crow say go Jim Crow
Go Jim Crow, say go monkey go
That’s what you want me to do, right?
(Are you entertained?)[Hook: Lizi Bailey]
I'm a stranger, no one knows me
No one understands the troubled man that I be
How'd I get here? Please come and ﬁnd me
I wanna go somewhere that all my cares can be free

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Yeah, I had a dream all people were made equal (yea)
Hollywood and hip-hop didn't exploit evil (dang)
Ignorance wasn't synonymous with Hood (dang)
We wanted God and we didn't settle for good (dang)
In my dreams He will save you
And Lord's not a name to increase an agenda or platform (dang)
In a world where government cared more
About feedin' the poor and not fundin' the war (dang)
No matter your color we were all brothers
Some just have a different type of tan than others
Ha, in my dream hate was bowin' down to grace
Along with racism they were mentored by faith
Ha, then it grew and it became service along with racism
They were mentored by purpose
In my dream anger was quick to listen
Charity and peace were close friends with riches (yeah)
Contentment was never jealous of business
And pride was always kickin' it tight with forgiveness
Ha, in my dreams it's such a good life there
I'm startin' to think I don't belong in this nightmare (hey)

[Bridge: Lizi Bailey]
Oh, something in me knows this is not my home
This is not my home
And a stranger I will be until you come for me
Until you take me home

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
It's been so many years, count the days and hours
I feel trapped in this world wide web no browser
Search my journey a pilgrim no mayﬂower
Just April showers April fool, April fool
Flashback grab that had that where's that fast track fade black
Ha where did it go?
First home ﬁrst gone thirst on hurts strong search on what's wrong
Ha where did it go?
Thrill is gone - that's the blues under blue skies
Time flies for every mile do I earn rewards
Tell me Lord put somethin' on my commissary
Penitentiary livin' from the sinning so wanna run on run home
Tryin' to ﬁnd myself that I lost that was so long
But after all this time my mind's so gone
My past is a stranger, my presence is acquainted
I soon forget my future I ain't never met
Unknown plastic faces displaced to betrayed visions
Images of shenanigans yeah dummy like mannequins
Can I speak candidly more fake than for real
Livin' in a fantasy freeze time insanity
Born to crawl walk run walk then crawl
The fate of all to face the call of every man's fall
The pain of that can drive many to be maniacs
Or manic depressive requestin' that's how insane we act
It's hard to face the facts that soon this track will run its course
I just pray that we'll be okay with what this means for us
The end is near no need to fear when hope is clear
The time keeps moving, it's true, bring in the chorus

[Hook]

[Outro: Sho Baraka]
Man it's such a good life there
You don't like my dreams, well good luck in this nightmare
Huh, it's such a good life there
You don't like my dreams, well good luck in this nightmare
Dang it's such a good life there, such a good life there
You don't believe in dreams, well good luck in this nightmare
Yeah good luck in this nightmare
It's such a good life there
I'm a stranger[Jai]
I - I - I'm
Free from sin from
Free from death from
Free from death from
Free from sin from
Free from death from
Free from...

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I know when you hear this beat it sound like something to step with
But morals and music you want them separate
Like garnish on the side something y'all don't mess with
That Christocentric rap eclectic
You might like rap that's wild and reckless
A soap box for lots of young and restless
They got ya head bobbing til ya lose ya necklace
Or better yet bobbing 'til it leaves you neckless
You know where death is, where no more breath is and 3rd graders learn how to leave you chestless
Where God is dissed, dismissed and distant and far from their hearts cause they hard and wicked
And sin hates God for real
That's why he's rarely talked about and he don't get the mass appeal
You might see sin blessing a meal that it eats while it cheats on the spouse out seeking a thrill

[Hook: Jai]
I'm free from sin
I win! I win!
I'm free! I'm free!
And no more chains are holding me!
I'm free from death
Got power now
Me kill the flesh
I'm free! I'm free!
(tell the world) I'm gone... I'm gone!

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds, she came to see him he hopin' to see her
They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either
And over God they choose to feed they fever
See he don't understand that It's Christ who bled for
Every second glance every turn of his head yo
And she don't really get that
Jesus did that
For every time she fantasize about his six pack
They sure like Al B
To connect like his brows be
And with they bodies spit in God's face so foully
Sin so
Bad it's a liar
It's says we on the throne tells God to retire
It's says He ain't enough
And it says we want more
Is says He ain't Just and it says He ain't Lord
Sin is the laugh at his power
Rape of his mercy
Mock of his patience
It say He ain't worthy

[Hook: Jai]

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
I been duped and been schemed
Like the Lord was cool with my sinning
Mocking the cross living unrepented
My sinful life kept us so
Distant
I know Lord and been king
Let him run your life like a
Simmons
Then you'll start loving his righteousness and we start
Looking just like his kids

[Bridge: Sho Baraka]
Live free by His mercy and grace
Live free by His mercy and grace and tell the world I'm gone (I'm gone)
Live free by His patience and peace
Live free by His patience and peace and tell the flesh I'm gone (I'm gone)
Live free by His joy and love
Live free by His joy and love and tell the lust I'm gone (I'm gone_
Live free by His truth and just
Live free by His truth and just and tell the hate I'm gone (I'm gone)[Hook]
Rich man lies and he rises
Poor man lies and he dies
We do it all for the money
All for the money
All for the money, for the money money money
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us

[Verse 1]
We tryin' to bloom in the city lights
I think we ask what's up cuz we're scared of heights
Poor man saw his rose die when he lied
Rich man lies, he saw his rose rise
Greed begets more greed
Hood rats love the trap that brings more cheese
We get the world but want more Adam and Eve
I got so much to hide but I need more leaves
The same person addicted to caffeine
Likes to look down at the person who does smoke weed
The war on drugs is the war on us, import make money then lock 'em up
I said doctor can you ﬁx my ills
He thinks ﬁxin' my ills is givin' me more pills (please)
That means I get more bills, poor man can only leave tears in his will

[Hook]
Rich man lies and he rises
Poor man lies and he dies
We do it all for the money
All for the money
All for the money, for the money money money
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us

[Verse 2]
Get ya hand out my pocket, get ya hand out my pocket
Out my pocket don't ride me no mo
Would less welfare make the poor care and work hard, I really don't know
I know a girl who makes a grip, all she gotta do is strip
She makes about 3 G's maybe 4
I tried to tell her to quit, she's like what's better than this?
Go to college and pay school loans?
Well let me teach you about some ghetto wrath
Baby momma's gettin' beat but still comin' back
School of hard knocks is where she learned to add
3 jobs for 2 kids that's some ghetto math
Rich man can he get a dollar please
Life feels wasted so his pants at his knees
We've all got bad aim in the darkness
How can I reach my goal instead of being a target?

[Hook (x2)]
Rich man lies and he rises
Poor man lies and he dies
We do it all for the money
All for the money
All for the money, for the money money money
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us
Lord Father forgive us, Lord Father forgive us

[Verse 3]
She said, he said alright I ain't pointin' ﬁngers...
This is what he said
He said...
I know civility died last week when I couldn't get my kids food to eat
And if opportunity knocks on my door I'm lockin' him in the basement, haha
I see fools gold wearin' fools
Accumulate that gold young man hide it in your mouth
On your neck in your hair on your wrist
Cuz of course that's where it's most proﬁtable
And when your gold... I'm sorry... God begins to wear you down
Appraise your heart and character to see his real glory
We all international player, I just go to learn
Souls of men last forever but money will burn
Thanks for the invite to your melting pot
I feel like I'm the only one that's molten a lot
Your hospitality is a manifest destiny
And the welcome mat is soaking wet, it's from the years of tears
I don't seek resolution of pain amongst the privileged
They tried to break me but all they created was more soul
More strength, watch me dance, watch me dance
I will dance on your bureaucracy
I will dance cuz all I've ever had was a jig, ha
And if you're confused, I'm talkin' to you[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
I go hammer, I know He was nailed
I know Jesus walks, I'm never going to hell
I know people talk, delete that junk mail
I got my passport stamped overseas, diggin' wells
Tryin' not to lust for them clothes I can't spell
If you don't live behind your bars, you and I don't gel (tell 'em)
Free man now but a slave to my savior
College graduate but I'm still going for majors
Yeah, black belt in a bad way
Judo know? I did what my sensei (preach)
Notorious was my mindset, I got faith - wasn't ready to die yet
(take that take that)
Now take that from a Bad Boy
None of it's mines I'm just playin' with my dad's toys (preach)
I got the church with me, I'm tryin' to be like the Bible not a bad verse in me

[Hook]
And if you know He's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
And if you know He's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
And if you know He's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
Come on praise the Lord, let's praise the Lord

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
This dude said "why you rap off beat?"
I don't rap off beat, the beat is off me
Ha, that's a little joke for 'em
I ain't rappin' for the bread but you could give a toast for 'em (west coast)
How long these clowns gon' wear a mask try to distract us
Halloween is a scary day for the rappers
Get it? Rewind it and start it over
I'm livin' whale I may change my name to Jonah
I got a Hebrew walk, keepin' it kosher
It's hard to be ﬂy when you duckin' the vultures huh (yeah)
How does a prophet and a priest forgive a liar, a fool, a phony and a thief (preach)
Yeah, can a brother get a witness?
Freestyles non proﬁt but he still give 'em the business (hey)
Dinner with death just to show 'em where the mortal is
Watch the sunrise just in time for a mornin' hymn

[Hook]
And if you know he's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
And if you know he's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
And if you know he's been good then praise the Lord (preach)
Come on praise the Lord, let's praise the Lord... talk to 'em Duce

[Verse 3: Duce Banner]
Last year round this time my grandfather died
I thank God every day he got to live a full life
Friends hustle said I had a future not to waste it
Then I got sappy they right, I never woulda made it
Too emotional for thuggin' see that's a handicap
That road would only lead to bein' dead, in jail or handicapped
Last I heard at church he catchin bodyies in the street
I'm sure reppin' with perspective by me bodyin' this beat (well)
Grew up a Christian he found me and I repented
But still was Dennis the menace my earnest prayer to be with it
Till one day I said forget it, this ain't real it's a scrimmage
Like Michael Jordan told Pippen I'll leave the game you can win it
Workin' at Target but Target ain't my target
I've been aimin' at my target since this rap thing started I
Treated him like a dog, I had God backwards
Now they mention me on Twitter, I'm back at it...

[Outro]
Ah yeah can we get a praise break?
Ha, can we get a praise break?
We gettin' happy doin' the praise break
We gettin' happy doin' the praise break
And if you love Him like I love Him praise the Lord
And if you know you been good praise the Lord
And with your life and your words just praise the Lord
Come on praise the Lord
Let's praise the Lord[All]
MAN UP!

Lecrae:
Momma want some more Obama in me the hood want PAC hip hop wanna see the
Common in me. And since this a senseless contradiction I end up a misfit tryina fit In
This ends when I stand up and see the hands of the standard: holy is
The lamb huh(holy is the lamb) Now we holding you to man up cause we were made
In his image start looking at what you came from

[KB]
Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy had to make adamant after what
Adonai is against. Let me take you back to the tree in Eden
If you read it you'll see that eve was deceived but Adam is the one who let it in
(Man up) Standing Leading no, we ain't leading we (Bump that) Basically little boys with
Muscles and a mustache! The femininity, we need a remedy, the God-Man, a
100 percent (strength) masculinity

[Trip Lee]
Where the men at, seems like they all lost, none of them are on the scene
Seems like they died off. They extinct but my dream is to rise up, we
Chasing the prize of the King the divine boss, but we fell away, now we
UnGodly we lose and we really got the blues like Navi
I wanna celebrate the dudes that's beside me fellas lets elevate we through with the lobby

[Tedashii:]
Go ahead I say boy Get your shine on. and if a sucker try to block you get your 9 home and
What I heard you gotta do to be a man now, stand up for yourself so I took
It in my hands now. And that's the problem man we busy trying to solve it
All the while we walking dead man somebody bring the coffin, voice drop
Peach fuzz now you think that your a man cause you feeling yourself you
Need to man up!

[Sho Baraka]
Sex and models, and tipping bottles back a pile of excuses right next to
Your bottle caps. A rolodex filled with names that you aim to
Please next to the stack of money, building up a heart of greed. Ice on his
Neck give the jokers a cold shoulder, you drunk off pride plus you loving
The hangover. You gotta whole lotta stuff that won't amount to gain life
Will never make sense cause you never made change

[PRo]
You got it Twisted sick like a fever, little man live to stack dough
Keebler. Man up! Get up out of the treehouse leave the cookies alone it's
Time to eat meat now. Trying to show you a new way to live now, no charge
You can call it a freestyle. without Christ you know how your man is, you
A boy in a mans body like Tom Hanks in BIG

[Andy Mineo]
Being a man got nothing to do with age. You can be a boy till the day you
Lay in your grave. None of us behave like the image of who were made, cause
We've fallen away it's better known as depraved. Running from
Responsibility really we crave the easy way out of places that call us to
Pull our weight. Man there going through everyday decisions are made
Responding to the call God's giving em from the...

[All]
Man Up!
Andy:
Let the process begin, separate the boys from the men
[All]
Man Up!

I done fought a lot of pain and addiction
I done shown a lot of help and intervention
Don't look at me like I'm bad, I just need a little rehab
I done seen the devil's tricks in the night yeah
But I'm tryin' to hold onto the light yeah
Don't look at me like I'm bad, I just need a little rehab
Oh, rehab, rehab, yes Lord rehab, oh rehab

[Verse 1: Sho Baraka]
Hello everyone I'm a me-aholic
I've been sober since about uhh... 9 this mornin'
I know the Lord sees my greed it's so appalling
I spent my phone money on clothes so I missed my callin'
But my extended adolescence is so stylish
I want Play-Doh, I'm so childish
Sometimes I serve to get an applause
But when they stop the applause I'mma stop serving y'all
My sexual past just brings more scars
I'm tryin' not to compare my wife to porn stars
Cuz unchecked lust can be a cruel thing
I struck out serving my love too many mood swings
I know Jesus the holy and true King
I'm too busy tryin' to make him a cool thing
Uhh... am I sharin' too much?
Will my openness lead another brother to lust?
I know that my accountability sucks
It's huntin' season for that lust, tell this brother to duck
Doubt whispers in my head that God ain't real
My flesh just wants an excuse to do what it feels
So guys I just need a little help (little help)
I'm a little tired of worshippin' myself (self)
I know these words may seem strange (seem strange)
But I came here lookin' for some change

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Theory Hazit]
Hello everyone I'm a me-aholic
Just ﬁnished the dirty deed like Alicia Keys I'm fallin'
And I ain't tryin' to have nobody stumbling and fallin'
From umm... fill in the blank and thank God nobody saw it
Man I promise I'm so self-conscious
Should I spit it conscious or should I preach the gospel
Would I lose my fans would my next one drop
I wonder if the underground gon' accept me or not
My appearance is everything, I rock a pair of cool J's
I'm tryin' to lose weight and get buff like Cool-J
And I gotta get that scrill to secure all my feelin's
Pay all my bills and spoil all my children
That ain't enough, I need money left over
I'm sick of hand-me-downs and eatin' on leftovers
Man I hate rejection and I lust for your approval
If I confess my sins the church may consider removal
So guys I just need a little help
I'm a little tired of worshippin' myself
I know these words might seem strange
But I came here lookin' for some change (well alright)

[Hook][Hook]
On and on I know life goes
I'm mourning the death of a Michael
Not Jackson, but one missin' in action
One who was shot over some fashion
Who lost hope when his dad split
Who caught AIDS from a self-proclaimed bad b*tch (watch yo mouth homie)
My culture's goin' down, gather around, my culture's goin' down
Watch it burn baby burn, my culture's goin' down
Watch it burn baby burn, my culture's goin' down

[Verse 1]
Let's start the revolution while we're still young
Industry hype well this is the real in for some
Off the wall moonwalk no need for a drug
I've been bad I'm just tryin' to ﬁnd my other glove (yo talk to 'em)
And play catch with the widow's son
He tryin' to ball, I'm tryin' to tell him to own a club
Young boy got himself a little lady bug
They call em B's in the street, he's tryin' at catch a buzz
My hood needs more fathers and less bachelors
Introduce 'em to the Father - no more bastards
Introduce 'em to manhood, let's see what that does
If he's tryina reach the stars I'll call NASA (you better preach homie)
But I'm no pastor - runaway slave who has now turned rapper
College educated but no need for a master's
Fall in love with this sound baby and we'll catch ya
Hah, man Sho who are you dog? You come around here like this a zoo dog?
You look the part, but what's really hood?
We don't see you 'round here but ya talk is good

[Hook]
On and on I know life goes
I'm mourning the death of a Michael
Not Jackson, but one missin' in action
One who was shot over some fashion
Who lost hope when his dad split

My culture's goin' down, gather around, my culture's goin' down
Watch it burn baby burn my, culture's goin' down
Watch it burn baby burn my, culture's goin' down

[Verse 2]
They may have heard about God but they think why bother
They heard Hail Mary's but never knew our Fathers
Have they heard of the love of Christ?
Is heaven so far that it's out of sight? (what's up dog?)
A son starts to cry, his father's found dead and I don't know why
I can't really look him in his eyes
It's hard to explain why his father really died (yo cuz we gotta go)
Maybe pride, maybe lies, maybe over a girl who belonged to another guy
She's a proud video vixen
She ain't got jelly, she the whole dang kitchen
Young boy's addicted, yeah them boys itchin'
Old men hooked with a look got em ﬁshin' (man, shorty bad)
She promised me a hell of a night
All I can think to myself is how Lucifer write
Brothers in the club throwin' you some bucks
How about these same brothers throwin' you some trust?
Baby girl you mistake your own value
You're only worth the value of the idol you bow down to

[Hook]
On and on I know life goes
I'm mourning the death of a Michael
Not Jackson, but one missin in action
One who was shot over some fashion
Who lost hope when his dad split
Who caught AIDS from a self-proclaimed bad, bad
My culture's goin' down, gather around, my culture's goin' down
Gather around, my culture's goin' down
Gather around, my culture's goin' down

[Outro]
Minute after minute
Hour after hour
Day after day we be lustin' for that power
Politicians and thugs, intellectuals and cowards
Will do anything to get their hands on some power
I gotta get that power
Gimme some of that power
Need some of that power
Can't live without that power
I gotta get that power
Gimme some of that power
Need some of that power
Can't live without that power
