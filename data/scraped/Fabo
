[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabo of D4L]
I'm still seeing spaceships on Bankhead
I'm too fucked up!

I need a trippy bitch, ratchet bitch
The one that like the drugs
She addicted to the club
Ain't with the cute shit
I'm looking for a hundred piece
That's got the real freak in her blood
I'm two fucked up, already doubled up
Bands'll get her naked like a birthday
Bougie, cute, gold digger
Hold up, you got the wrong nigga in the first place
I like to see her spread her legs in the two seater
Wet and hot, runnin' like a meter
Tellin' me, all she want me to do is beat it
Got her leakin' by the liter
So I eat her cause it's sweeter
I need a real trippy bitch when I'm fucked up
Ain't with that cute shit in my spaceship
Gas blowin' on your way out
Tell your homegirl to come in
Cause yo ass can't stay here

[Interlude: Trinidad Jame$ (Fabo of D4L)]

Ohh shit, That was Fabo
(Yo ass can't stay here)
Smoke Break!
DANNY BROWN!!

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Hell yeah I play with my nose
Got powder stains on designer clothes
I be rollin' off of them crystals
Got a nigga brain feelin' like a launch missile
God damn right
Off that thizzle, Bitch I'm ballin, blow my whistle
Smokin' on a Bobby Johnson
Got felatio at my concert
Knockin on them hoes tonsils (2x)
Got my cock all up in her noggin
When I be shoppin'
And she callin' callin' me daddy
Got road head up in that caddy
And she the driver
And I can't explain nothin'
But I know one thing it was fatal
I be higher than a motherfucker
Fucked up, turn down for what?
I wanna fuck, she wanna fuck
So we hit the BP to grab a rum
Copped a Fiji and a box of magnums
Hit that bitch with that arm and hammer
Dope dick, stay focused
Need a trippy bitch...
I got a 20oz, couple lines in it
..but sure I'm finished
Heart beat sound like I'm playin' tennis
Drinkin' Dr. Pepper, looking just like dentists
Looking for a trippy bitch
That cute shit I ain't with that
Ratchet bitches getting turnt up
Off a couple pills and a six pack

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Playa Fly]
I'm too fucked up
My crew fucked up
My boo fucked up
They roughed me up too much
That made me tough
So now I'm too turnt up on O-Zs of OG burnt up
I be in chronic city
Player fly to funky town
Codeine and prometh and tussin'
Next there to wash 'em down
Pop me a roxy, percocet
Or a Lortab
I'm on that molly, plus that Madonna
I'm going mad
...til the diz-ay I diz-ie
Set that shit back I'm crownin'
They still live by the now, fly
Need my bitches fire
I need my bitches hiz-igh
So high we gettin' sky
Til they can't take no more now they fly
They soakin' wet, never try
And overflow of supply
The truth they cannot deny
And givin' only a try
No ho, no owe me no lie
Keep dummy promises from me
The influence I'm under
But I'm on top of this money
Say, what's funny honey
Don't see no laughing stock
Not your Winnie The Pooh
But do want into your honey pot
Turn down the giggle box
Turnt up her kiss my spot
Gyrating and motivating on chemicals
Recreating Woodstock
I wish I would stop
Like they say turn down for what?
Before they turnt up, get crunk
I come to get niggas buck
And now they stuck with me
And trill and buck with me
I need a trippy bitch to come get fucked up with me

[Outro]
Hold up, man
Y'all just heard that shit?
Man, y'all playin'
Anyways man, where my homegirls?
I don't have groupies

Hey lil buddy in the orange and blue

I'm starchy when I take em to the Grammy's
And wipe all over your starchy and fantasy
Smell like candy but taste like sweets
Line of the work from paper to grease
Hey mana lese they flirted with diamonds
My diamonds got diamonds so I'm always shining
The crown full of hollasion must be rocking
Ain't all in the can but I sure be stopping
All on the dance floor while I'm pop locking n dropping
Niggas throwin' 100 dollars in your pocket
I'll woo woo wobble on your face, I'm a park it
Diamond is the name and money is the target (YUP)

{Chorus 2x's}Hook: 8x

A North Avenue, 1342
While you at home with boo, I'm on the grind ho

Please do not make me mad, with all the ackin bad

Where the muthafuckers from what'cha thinking

Hook: 8x

It's on da map (uh huh, yeah!)

Verse 3: Fabo

There come the police, knocking on my do'
With the GBI, said I was over the Georgia line
I committed a homicide
Running for my life this year it's 2000 I'm bout to get mine
Started flipping the scrip, on the grind, all the time
Now it's tragedy, cause everybody know what's happening
They got me up at the post office, they after me
Can't capture me
I'm a young gun, a desperado
Go blow for blow
I'm a hell of a nigga, they already know
I know they'll try that's why I got my vest protecting my chest
And I'm dressed in black boy
And that's the really take care of the rest
I'm feeling distressed, I know I should've but do I would
Muthafucker tried to buck, that's why I had to do it
I could've blew it, I did it execution style
He was on his knees and nailed his hands on the bathroom tile
I stayed awhile, and filled the house of evidence
They go through hell fucking with this Georgia resident

Hook: 16x

It's on the map (uh huh, yeah!)

(Pastor Troy)

They bout to see a blood bath, A blood bath
[repeat 7x][Intro]
A thousand pieces in a jigsaw of beautiful mistakes
The debris of beauty flickers
In the sadness of a smile
It’s the perfection of your imperfection

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Beauty's when you just got out the shower
Hair still drippin', wrapped up in a towel
Beauty's when you ready in a hour
Them long legs, I call em the Twin Towers
You put that arch in it, put your hand on your hip
Put your hair in a bun, and you handle the shit
Beauty’s when the strut compliments sass
You know ya booty look good wit ya confident ass (shit)
Straight up, but the rest swerve
You know it's beauty when the smile is her best curve
That's real beauty, no makeup shit
The girl you dream about, and wanna wake up with
Wait until I'm lookin then you throw it at me
Go down on me, then you look up at me
Awhh man, that shit right there
Probably give your ex nightmares

[Interlude: Wale]
Miss Brooklyn New York
I'll give you whatever to get to your heart
Know your worth baby girl, love
This Soul Tape shit
Never make shift, all naturale
Put it down
Young Ralph, let's get it

[Verse 2: Wale]
Beauty is knowing nobody's real as you
Truly condolences for that pairs of shoes
Killing the scene, this type of love will make you complete
Now roll the weed and get the munchies, she be the cuisine
When Im her jeans I'm still in tune with the inner being
Her inner thoughts, her worst fears she give to me
Beauty is loyalty to the fullest
‘Cause cupid made me a target for she had received a bullet
For she I get super deep, maybe speed up
Before I pull out and sex is a weapon
But beauty don’t need a bullet
Beauty is the beauty that her mother gave her
May you be guarded by God, me and grandmamas angels
It's God given, never complicated
A lot of niggas talking, I don’t have the heart to say it
The heart to tell you they see potential in how you do it
I pray you know your worth when niggas don’t notice your beauty, truly

[Outro: Fabolous]
You see, beauty isn't a rush
It's a process, sometimes it's slow
Yeah, I mean there's beauty in everything, ya know
You just gotta recognize it
Shoutout to the people who do
And I feel sorry for the people who don't
Soul Tape 2[Intro]
Aiyyo

Put on a whole show for me

To my boom boom clap, boom boom (OHH!)
Fabo told her shake that "Laffy Taffy" and she did exactly
What they do in Georgia, so I brought her across the border
Cause she say she never saw that ARCH befo'
So I showed her how to pose with that six point oh
Yeah that's that new dance
That new dance, that'll make your whole crew dance
And the funny thing about it, she don't even have to move jam
Just jump left, jump right, show that moment
When you boom boom snap in that Kodak moment

[Chorus] - 2X

[Fabo]
She got a smile like a bowlin ball; go crazy when she see that flash
Lights camera action I hear Mystikal when she "Shake it Fast"
I've seen things I ain't never seen with her
I'm Richie Rich, Professor Keenbean gave me her
Violent thoughts in my mind, I'm losin control
She from heaven I'm from Bankhead, OHH! God's blessed me
First time I seen her she was dancin off a Nelly song
Smiled at me right then, I was in the zone
Go up in my station, I'll show you big dipper
Stop, two dollar stop, Fabo show her big zipper OHH!
Girl smile, take a picture if you can
Make it "Tootsie Roll" (what's happenin)
Do it with no hands!!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Jibbs]
Aiyyo.. I was chillin wit my boy Fabo
And I saw this chickalicka
I told her to come hurr, come and get up in this picture
I say smile for me mami and the flash went flicker
She snappin, do three-sixty with her snap dance
She can make it look like a tap dance
I'm in this deal what's happenin~!
Jump to the left, jump to the, jump to jump to
Jump to the right, jump to the, jump to jump to
Take a picture turn around, bump your shoulders up and down
Girl get up in that stance, you can do it with no hands
Pose like a model cause you're so so cute
Then make your body move like you in a photo shoot

Smokin' on a Bobby Johnson
Got felatio at my concert
Knockin on them hoes tonsils (2x)
Got my cock all up in her noggin
When I be shoppin'
And she callin' callin' me daddy
Got road head up in that caddy
And she the driver
And I can't explain nothin'
But I know one thing it was fatal
I be higher than a motherfucker
Fucked up, turn down for what?
I wanna fuck, she wanna fuck
So we hit the BP to grab a rum
Copped a Fiji and a box of magnums
Hit that bitch with that arm and hammer
Dope dick, stay focused
Need a trippy bitch...
I got a 20oz, couple lines in it
..but sure I'm finished
Heart beat sound like I'm playin' tennis
Drinkin' Dr. Pepper, looking just like dentists
Looking for a trippy bitch
That cute shit I ain't with that
Ratchet bitches getting turnt up
Off a couple pills and a six pack

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Playa Fly]
I'm too fucked up

So now I'm too turnt up on O-Zs of OG burnt up
I be in chronic city
Player fly to funky town
Codeine and prometh and tussin'
Next there to wash 'em down
Pop me a roxy, percocet
Or a Lortab
I'm on that molly, plus that Madonna
I'm going mad
...til the diz-ay I diz-ie
Set that shit back I'm crownin'
They still live by the now, fly
Need my bitches fire
I need my bitches hiz-igh
So high we gettin' sky
Til they can't take no more now they fly
They soakin' wet, never try
And overflow of supply
The truth they cannot deny
And givin' only a try
No ho, no owe me no lie
Keep dummy promises from me
The influence I'm under
But I'm on top of this money
Say, what's funny honey
Don't see no laughing stock
Not your Winnie The Pooh
But do want into your honey pot
Turn down the giggle box
Turnt up her kiss my spot
Gyrating and motivating on chemicals
Recreating Woodstock
I wish I would stop
Like they say turn down for what?
Before they turnt up, get crunk
I come to get niggas buck
And now they stuck with me
And trill and buck with me
I need a trippy bitch to come get fucked up with me

[Outro]
Hold up, man
Y'all just heard that shit?
Man, y'all playin'
Anyways man, where my homegirls?
I don't have groupies
I have homegirls
All my homegirls bob your head with me one time
Yeah[Intro]
A thousand pieces in a jigsaw of beautiful mistakes
The debris of beauty flickers
In the sadness of a smile
It’s the perfection of your imperfection

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Beauty's when you just got out the shower
Hair still drippin', wrapped up in a towel
Beauty's when you ready in a hour
Them long legs, I call em the Twin Towers
You put that arch in it, put your hand on your hip
Put your hair in a bun, and you handle the shit
Beauty’s when the strut compliments sass
You know ya booty look good wit ya confident ass (shit)
Straight up, but the rest swerve
You know it's beauty when the smile is her best curve
That's real beauty, no makeup shit
The girl you dream about, and wanna wake up with
Wait until I'm lookin then you throw it at me
Go down on me, then you look up at me
Awhh man, that shit right there
Probably give your ex nightmares

[Interlude: Wale]
Miss Brooklyn New York
I'll give you whatever to get to your heart
Know your worth baby girl, love
This Soul Tape shit
Never make shift, all naturale
Put it down
Young Ralph, let's get it

[Verse 2: Wale]
Beauty is knowing nobody's real as you
Truly condolences for that pairs of shoes
Killing the scene, this type of love will make you complete
Now roll the weed and get the munchies, she be the cuisine
When Im her jeans I'm still in tune with the inner being
Her inner thoughts, her worst fears she give to me
Beauty is loyalty to the fullest
‘Cause cupid made me a target for she had received a bullet
For she I get super deep, maybe speed up
Before I pull out and sex is a weapon
But beauty don’t need a bullet
Beauty is the beauty that her mother gave her
May you be guarded by God, me and grandmamas angels
It's God given, never complicated
A lot of niggas talking, I don’t have the heart to say it
The heart to tell you they see potential in how you do it
I pray you know your worth when niggas don’t notice your beauty, truly

[Outro: Fabolous]
You see, beauty isn't a rush
It's a process, sometimes it's slow
Yeah, I mean there's beauty in everything, ya know
You just gotta recognize it
Shoutout to the people who do
And I feel sorry for the people who don't
Soul Tape 2[Intro]
Aiyyo
We about to bring this from the A-T-L to the S-T-L baby (Beatsta music)
{Ay Jibbs, watch this! Watch this shorty!} What up Fabo~!
Cause she do it with no hands, do it with no hands

[Chorus: Fabo]
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH! OHH! OHH!)

[Jibbs]
Oh snap she done posed for me
That flash run off and she did it on her toes for me
Put on a whole show for me
Like boom boom snap, boom boom snap
To my boom boom clap, boom boom (OHH!)
Fabo told her shake that "Laffy Taffy" and she did exactly
What they do in Georgia, so I brought her across the border
Cause she say she never saw that ARCH befo'
So I showed her how to pose with that six point oh
Yeah that's that new dance
That new dance, that'll make your whole crew dance
And the funny thing about it, she don't even have to move jam
Just jump left, jump right, show that moment
When you boom boom snap in that Kodak moment

[Chorus] - 2X

[Fabo]
She got a smile like a bowlin ball; go crazy when she see that flash
Lights camera action I hear Mystikal when she "Shake it Fast"
I've seen things I ain't never seen with her
I'm Richie Rich, Professor Keenbean gave me her
Violent thoughts in my mind, I'm losin control
She from heaven I'm from Bankhead, OHH! God's blessed me
First time I seen her she was dancin off a Nelly song
Smiled at me right then, I was in the zone
Go up in my station, I'll show you big dipper
Stop, two dollar stop, Fabo show her big zipper OHH!
Girl smile, take a picture if you can
Make it "Tootsie Roll" (what's happenin)
Do it with no hands!!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Jibbs]
Aiyyo.. I was chillin wit my boy Fabo
And I saw this chickalicka
I told her to come hurr, come and get up in this picture
I say smile for me mami and the flash went flicker
She snappin, do three-sixty with her snap dance
She can make it look like a tap dance
I'm in this deal what's happenin~!
Jump to the left, jump to the, jump to jump to
Jump to the right, jump to the, jump to jump to
Take a picture turn around, bump your shoulders up and down
Girl get up in that stance, you can do it with no hands
Pose like a model cause you're so so cute
Then make your body move like you in a photo shoot

[Chorus] - 2X
