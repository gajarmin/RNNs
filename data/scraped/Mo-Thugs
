(Felicia)
Lately you've been stressin me, that's when I'mma give you some
Callin me, jockin me, sweatin me, gonna rush me none
Cuz when the time is right I'm gonna let you know and, that's for sure
So wait on me, patiently, and see what I got in store
I'm gonna represent, to the fullest of it and I promise you no regrets
Just put you trust in me, and baby, I promise this shit is legit (Legit
Legit, legit)

Chorus (2x): Felicia (Krayzie Bone)
It's all good (Yup, yup, yup, it's all G-double-O-D, good, good, good)
It's all good (Yup, yup, yup, it's all G-double-O-D, good, good, good, with
Me, with me, with me)

(Felicia)
If I told you once, then I told you twice, you've got to get to know me
There's more to a relationship, then jumpin in the sheets
And if that's all you want, then you better go, cuz that ain't me
I don't give me love to just anybody
If I'm not correct, then prove me wrong and, just hold on
Gradually you'll see, just how good it'll be
When the time is right, I'll ease your mind with a little bump and grind
Fantasies full of ecstasy, we'll have a real good time

Chorus

(Krayzie Bone)
Since it's all good baby, we can get it on
Hey, you wanna ride? Krayzie Bone
Come and jump in the Benz and tell your friends that you will get with them
Later
Come and let me take ya, got a couple of things I wanna show ya
I'm really tryin to know ya, I'm just curious
Is it really all good? You serious (I'm serious)
If it is, then I gotta jump on it, ride it, ghetto cowboy
Surprise, you thought I was quiet, I never was shy baby, niggas just act like
That
Lay back, but don't let that buddah rule ya, give that nigga the bag
Cuz we won't have time to talk
I've been peepin for a minute now (Yep, yep, yep) and I know just where I'mma
Start
Let me listen to your heart beat, boom boom
Racing intense situation, is it gettin kinda hot it here? No, that's you
Temperatures are rising, so am I

Chorus Til End[Hook]

Trick, how you do yours behind close doors
Cause a nigga know about you on the down-low
I'm the player type, I lay it right off the jump
Puttin' some shit in your trunk that's gon' bump
But broad I really can't blame you
Playas will learn, these hoes got game too, righ

[Hook]
Ain't no reason for the games these hoes play

[Verse 2]
Now, I done seen these hoes come in all shapes and sizes

Tryin' to take out the next young brother
Lover of this man, greed, indeed
Sayin' you love to fuck, and smoke all his weed
Hey, that's the way life goes for these hoes
Playa, the next thing to stay up on your toes
Cause-a, like I told ya these hoes got game
Runnin' down a line of niggas like an Amtrak train

Mission impossible, cause these hoes simply incapable
Goin' for the cash, and dash first chance available
Bitch, really understand me
Ken D-A-W-G from the L-A-N-D
And I got game to come back on you twice as nice
Verbally hittin' your dome like it was a fight
Can't let me get all caught up in some shit
I let you know off the riff that I ain't havin' it, you hoes got game

[Hook]
Ain't no reason for the games these hoes play

[Verse 3]
I wonder, was this a setup?
Cause I know these nigga playa hatin'
You said there was money involved, waiting, huh
So now I come and see what it is
I handle my biz cause I gotta kid
And a, soon as leave out the door, I hear some shit
I didn't pay it no mind 'til I heard a click
What the fuck? These niggas tryin' to rob
Undercover setup bitch behind a job
Uh, had a nigga thinkin' it was about paper [damn]
Bitch, but this bitch was really on her caper
Now, I gotta wet up this bitch
Hope in the meantime, this ho get hit
Damn, ain't no reason for the games that you play
Don't wanna die today, but that's the price to pay
Uh, next time I pass up on that cash

Tell me who's the real ho? Baby it's official
I'll referee (brrrrrr) bitch blow the whistle

[Layzie Bone]
Tell her to blow it, ain't no stoppin man, get this motherfucker poppin man

Touchdown in the endzone mean money man, better get some
Field goal, now my friends on, countin Benjamins in the real zone
What's the real score? Bitches is wantin to constantly stay on the dick
What we here fo'? To get mo', that's why we be mobbin so thick
Quick to scream out Thug Nation, put the screen on the hation
Ain't no time gon' be wastin, y'all been patiently waitin
We have them T-shirt and panty parties, bitches be doin us favors
Wanna thank ya for the flavor, you know I'm never gon' savor

[Chorus: Thin C] + (Dre Ghost)
Put your hands in the air (bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)
Put my nuts on your chin (bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)

Did she really have kids? (Bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)
And who the fuck your next of kin? (Bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)
(Won't you show me somethin, go ahead and show me somethin!)

[Layzie Bone]
Don't break down it ain't over, over
Don't leave now, it ain't over, feel the party gettin started girl
You flawless should be against the law, got a nigga wantin to break you off
Come here girl, take that off, that body right there was made to floss
Made for me, give Thin a piece, give Dre a shot, he rock the cock
L.D.T. make panties drop, oh you one of them kind that like to block?
Oh you like to watch? Get you some popcorn, and watch the movie
Kick up your toes, I suppose, you gon' be comin up out of your clothes
And there you go, nobody knows, behind closed do's
Freaks exposed, ladies and hoes, wanna do me right after the show
Hey, ain't nothin wrong, with a little bit of bumpin and grindin
Tell me yo' age, show me yo' license, we ain't goin out like Tyson
Better try again, we dig you too, but the main thang is cooperatin
Cause that-a way you would get some play, and it just might make yo' day
Cause the official don't blow the whistle, when you steppin out of bounds
In yo' city or in yo' town, this how it's goin down

[Thin C]
Touchdown in the endzone, kicked it like a field goal
Get the extra points, tell me what's the real score?
Tell me who's the real ho? Baby it's official

Ay, ay, ay.. ay, ay...
Ay, ay, ay.. ay, ay...

[Chorus]

Yeah, niggas [Nigga, yeah nigga]

You gotta recognize
St.Clair Wasteland, nigga
[Wasteland, wasteland, wasteland, wasteland
Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers]
Ho-ass muthafuckin' bitches
I'm ready to kill 'em! Can you feel that?[Tre]
The word "love" is a hell of a word to be sayin'
You don't know how to use it with caution
It's a death-defying game to play
And when you're thinking of the one you wanna get next to
Be sure it's a mutual feeling
Cause these are the words they'll say

"Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on"
They kick a few lines from a slow song
Having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong
They say, "Baby, I'm yours
So go and close the bedroom door
Make sure the binds are closed"
Yo keep you comin' up out your clothes
The next day they don't know you no more
So, baby, take your time
Help me, ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find a one-of-a-kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled

Who do you  love? (You have to ask yourself)
Is it someone you can count on?
Someone who's there for you
Someone who will be true
No matter what the situation may be
And are they sent from above?
This question is asked for a reason
Cause some of them wanna play
And then go their separate ways
And hey, these are the words they'll say

[Tre]
"Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on"
They kick a few lines from a slow song
Having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong
They say, "Baby, I'm yours
So go and close the bedroom door
Make sure the binds are closed"
Yo keep you comin' up out your clothes
The next day they don't know you no more
So, baby, take your time
Help me, ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find a one-of-a-kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled

[Krayzie]
Ain't never had game, I shot real, shot real
Cause complications in your conversation
So you know it ain't real, gotta be real
So why you keep fallin' for lames and games?
Shame shame shame
How many strippings you wanna take
Until you learn the game's another definition for play?
So, won't ya ease-a your mind and block out all distraction
Take your time
Take your time
Slow down [slow down] your action
Ya see, cause that's your disaster

Take your time
Ease my mind (Baby, won't you take your time?)
Take your time, help me ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find, I'm one of a kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled[Cat Cody]
No, no, no, no, no
We ain't said no names, y'all
We know just who you are
And exactly why you came
Now wouldn't it be real fucked up
If we start namin' names?
We ain't said no names

[Krayzie]
I can remember back in the day
If you bit another nigga
You was considered a biter
Non-originality, simply disrespectin' a true rider
Nigga, I'm fired up
Nigga, keep on bitin' the Bone
And your jaw'll get wired up
Keep on lovin' my song
But my nigga, you ain't Bone
Can you understand what's wrong?
Better get on
Sayin' you been flowin' since back in the day
Some of you was
Well okay, but whatever it was you were stressin'
It wasn't effecting nobody like this way
Hit me, so niggas can miss me with they drama
Tell them all like Willie-D told niggas
"Bitch, play with your mama. Cause I'm not your toy."
So nigga don't test me, cause Krayzie ain't no sample
But really, could you handle
Big old slugs from these here magnum?
Ever since we came with Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Niggas been comin' up out the woods singin'
We stole they flow and song
If that's the case then why when we kick
Wicked shit, muthafuckas all like it?
And then why when you come tryin' to kick my shit
I can tell you strugglin' tryin'?
And back in the day how many niggas
Was really claimin' to be thugs?
Niggas was gangstas
So what the fuck done changed 'em? Huh?
What really be fuckin' my head up
Is when one nigga do somethin', come up
Make a Little bit of money, somebody all on your nuts
I'm keepin' it real, and bitch
If you Feel I'm talkin' bout you
Then it must be the guilt
I think we should give them the murder treatment
Yeah, that should learn 'em, baby

[Krayzie]
Oh, oh, we gonna kill them with the big shotgun
Yeah, fuck y'all niggas who's talkin', nigga
Niggas talkin' shit over here, nigga
Fuck y'all niggas wantin' to do it

Aw shit, these niggas done started over here
They talkin' shit, say we ain't rappin' (What?)
Niggas has got the nerve, and look who platinum
Niggas been runnin' off at the mouth
Before they think and look at the reality
I'm a speak on it, so bitch, be mad at me
Now first of all, y'all can't even talk
Y'all need to go get your speech right
And then while you at it
You need quit samplin' that bullshit
And get your beats tight
Let's meet up at midnight in the alley
Where nobody knowin' what's happenin'
What's happenin?
You wanna pull out some guns or do some rappin'?
A nigga don't want no problems
But then if he wants to cause it - a nine millimeter
Dawed-off, a .380, TEC-9, comin' out my closet
Probably only have to pull a muthafuckin' twenty-two
Probably just say "Boo!"
And watch you niggas scuffle, scatter everywhere
Them niggas up outta there
That studio shit been known
To give niggas like you wig-splits
I hear you talkin', woofin' nigga
But I really can't feel shit
Now face it, nigga, rap just ain't the same
Especially since my Mo Thug family encountered the game
The fame is pain, for this I'll pay the price
And niggas tryin' to take my life
Always feelin' violent vibes
Just because I'm shinin' now
In the hood, it was sarcastic shit like
"You paid now, been awhile since you came around."
So you tellin' me that I ain't down?
But first of all, when I was broke as fuck
You niggas did not give a fuck
Now all of the sudden
Ya lovin' me when we drunk, playa hata
We know who you are, can find out where you live
Better protect your kids
Fuck it, let's blow up his crib
10-o'clock news: "Nobody lived."

[Tombstone]
You better roll
Cause we give no love where we got to buck
Break you off somethin' proper with hate
I 'll break you off somethin' proper with love
It's all how you take it
We been never takin' no strippin'
For the body dippin'
Grips in the wasteland all from mad-testin'
Even though they know about death - a cold place to rest in

[Cat Cody]
We know just who you are
And exactly why you came
Now wouldn't it be real fucked up
If we start naming names?
We ain't said no names(Felicia)
Lately you've been stressin me, that's when I'mma give you some
Callin me, jockin me, sweatin me, gonna rush me none
Cuz when the time is right I'm gonna let you know and, that's for sure
So wait on me, patiently, and see what I got in store
I'm gonna represent, to the fullest of it and I promise you no regrets
Just put you trust in me, and baby, I promise this shit is legit (Legit
Legit, legit)

Chorus (2x): Felicia (Krayzie Bone)
It's all good (Yup, yup, yup, it's all G-double-O-D, good, good, good)
It's all good (Yup, yup, yup, it's all G-double-O-D, good, good, good, with
Me, with me, with me)

(Felicia)
If I told you once, then I told you twice, you've got to get to know me
There's more to a relationship, then jumpin in the sheets
And if that's all you want, then you better go, cuz that ain't me
I don't give me love to just anybody
If I'm not correct, then prove me wrong and, just hold on
Gradually you'll see, just how good it'll be
When the time is right, I'll ease your mind with a little bump and grind
Fantasies full of ecstasy, we'll have a real good time

Chorus

(Krayzie Bone)
Since it's all good baby, we can get it on
Hey, you wanna ride? Krayzie Bone
Come and jump in the Benz and tell your friends that you will get with them
Later
Come and let me take ya, got a couple of things I wanna show ya
I'm really tryin to know ya, I'm just curious
Is it really all good? You serious (I'm serious)
If it is, then I gotta jump on it, ride it, ghetto cowboy
Surprise, you thought I was quiet, I never was shy baby, niggas just act like
That
Lay back, but don't let that buddah rule ya, give that nigga the bag
Cuz we won't have time to talk
I've been peepin for a minute now (Yep, yep, yep) and I know just where I'mma
Start
Let me listen to your heart beat, boom boom
Racing intense situation, is it gettin kinda hot it here? No, that's you
Temperatures are rising, so am I

All life long

[Layzie Bone]
If bein' a thug in love is a crime
They might as well take me to jail
They might as well throw away the key
Cause livin' with out you was hell
Wear my ring and be my queen

Funny thing, how life can bring
Together untouchable teams

[Felecia]
Now follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Take this riding ecxtasy
The magic takes me
His and her Bentleys'

When you feel horny I got somethin' for ya girl

[Felecia]

Forever we keepin' it on and poppin'
Haters is watchin' and it ain't no stoppin' us

[Hook] 3xII Tru's comin' to get ya fools
Nothin' but the best females
This remains, not nothin'
But the females caught in the rapture
Recognize II Tru's comin' to get ya fools

[Cabrina]
Come let a sista break you off with true flex
Straight off the View
I'm housin' crazy fools straight servin' bread
So, let me make grand entrance
II Tru's comin' to get ya fools
Leavin' 'em clues, but layin'
Cause you playin', sold no dues
Buyin' a ?, some kneel before a sista
Had to break your backside for underestimatin'
II Tru playas on this rap vibe
With skills they be flippin' the script
Regardless Mo Thug got my back, you hold that
You catch a sista slippin' on these hard raps
Ain't no ? with a sista leakin' honestly speakin'
Gotta use they gift of flow to flip my dough
'Til I reach my peak, man
Comin' up with skills on the real, though
It don't stop, sista thought you knew this
AJay comin' back up tight with this beat for the score II
Tru hits

(Chorus):
This remains, not nuthin' but best females caught in the rapture
Recognize II Tru's comin' to get ya fools

[Jhaz]
Well, it's Jhaz, comin' at you megablast
You don't want to see these skills corrupt the mic
My lyrics kill on the real
Don't underestimate cause I'm a lady
You must be crazy, don't play me short
Cause the az will fade these on
And from the weed, inhalin' all the chronic
Blazed forever dazed
II Tru comin' at through your phonics, so smoke it
Put it on my grave, II Tru high
I said it, I meant it
Pay attention, child, there's value to this lesson
No question my bag is tight in any situation, dope
My camp is real trues, no need for perpetratin'
Flossin', but you know I never change
I'm still that same old Jhaz them St. Clair streets
With a pocket full of cash, fool
A true forever, don't forget it
II Tru all through my blood, understand?
Don't disrespect it

(Chorus)

[Cabrina]
Comin' straight off Clearview
Understand, man, I gotsta serve ?
It means that flow that we sistas droppin'
II Tru gain much respect
In this game of deals
Who gonna be that fool to get served? (With nerve...)

[Jhaz]
...With nerve enough to test trues
This mack ten's all you deserve, word, but...

[Cabrina]
...on the real these skills ain't nothin' funny
Got lyric for days
But you best believe it's about that money (money)

[Jhaz]
Suddenly, let my mood groove you
School you, teach you the way of the trues
So go your own path, silly child
Guaranteed in the end I swear you lose

[Cabrina]
Fool, recognize this set up
We females gettin' stupid on the rhyme styles we kickin'
Really ain't nothin' to it
II Tru's got what you're lookin' for
Long of a way to drama
Stackin' loot for them tape sales
Said before, we gots no problem
In the C a game of flexin'
You play the rules, you lose

[Jhaz]
Choose wisely, second guess my flex
Bow down so to praise these trues

(Chorus)
Nothin' but the females (caught in the rap shit)(Souljah Boy)
Me low down, low down, low down

(Chours 2x)

(Krayzie)
Now what if we banged your brain
Put 'em in a coffin, and that's where they lay?
Nigga, wanna row the boat to get chromed
Dump 'em in the river
Now, that's how we play
Hey, murdered them niggas that's plottin' to rob me
Hollow point top in your body
Nigga fin to bless your soul with a twelve gauge Mossberg
Leavin' you stiff and cold
Nigga, what ya gonna do when
The muthafuckin' thugstas come for you?
You snooze, you lose, you catch this uzi
Nigga fin to shoot the po-po, too, and we do
Runnin' with a nigga with finger on his trigger
When I catch 'em, I fill 'em with ammunition
Hit 'em with the bullet and I really meant to get ya
They miss 'em
Hey, we down with the swangin'
No fake entertainin'
We quick when to fuck-a you up, oh my!
Gauges and uzis and three fifty-sevens
We load 'em and shoot for your head. You die!
Niggas, they better test me
Leatherface quick when he pull out this weapon. [Hey.]
We leavin' 'em headless
Respect them Clair playas, bitch

(Chours)

(Souljah Boy)
I'm on a mission [mission]
I'm swift when I empty my clip
You oughta' beat your ass
Real fast to safety, man
If a soldier's about to rip
You get lit, get hit
As I split your shit
Ain't worried 'bout a nigga tellin'
Yellin' muthafuckin' thangs
All you bitches [soldiers] gon' lay stiff
As I shift with my grip off into a whole new level

(Krayzie)
Gon' on my click, and now you're dead wrong [dead wrong]
Rest in peace
They seem to be creepin' up on me lately
Fuck it, let's all go crazy
Sell weed daily
And we ready
My thugstas love
When we buck buck
Put 'em underground, fuck 'em
Krayzie release them shells
I say, "say fuck it, let's all go to Hell,"
Cause I got my money
My pistol
My reefer
Never forget my thugs, what?
Hey, we slay
We spray

(Souljah Boy)
We pray everyday
But still I see that you and me
Just don't mix
So I grab my grip
I'm a kill your click
That's the end of this shit
So don't you ever
In your muthafuckin' life try to test me
Steppin' like Rambo with this bulletproof vest and with a knife
You better respect me
Or I won't think twice
I'm killin' your wife
Your bitch get sniped just like Wesley
Don't test me
Don't press me
Krayzie Bone will open up they chest, G

(Krayzie/Souljah Boy)

Yeah, niggas [Nigga, yeah nigga]
Yeah, ho-ass niggas, y'all muthafuckas
[Shit.] ain't ready for this muthafuckin' real thug shit
[That's the shit
Niggas ain't ready.] Bone shut shit down
[Shut shit down!], completely down!
[Completely down!] You hoes didn't know? [Huh?]
You gotta recognize
St.Clair Wasteland, nigga
[Wasteland, wasteland, wasteland, wasteland
Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers]
Ho-ass muthafuckin' bitches
I'm ready to kill 'em! Can you feel that?(Rioting: explosions, shouting, and helicopters flying)

Krayzie and Felecia (with the Mo Thugs Family):
We are (we are) Mo Thugs (Mo Thugs)
Mighty, mighty warrior (mighty, mighty warrior)

[Wish]
We crept and we came
Givin' you nothin' but thugsta music, man
We doin' our thang
My mighty, mighty Mo Thug bringin' the pain
Soldiers marchin', all prepared for war
We're all ready to go, now
I pray, just watch over us, my Lord
Out of time, so I'm expressin' mine
They said, it's goin' to end around ninety-nine
We gotta grind, we gotta grind
Can I please have all of mine while there's time
Because it's almost over?
Yeah, roll or get rolled over
Hey, hey, hey
And if you're rollin' with me
Then you're rollin' with Mo
Pump your fist up high
And let me see 'em for sure
Everybody say Mo, say Mo, say Mo

(Chorus)

[Thug Queen]
Mighty, mighty warrior destroyin' ya
Rather have us incarcerated in handcuffs
Than livin' for lust
In mighty Mo Thug do I trust
Time for Armageddon
Get on your knees and get to repentin'
Heavenly messages, I'm sendin'
My first love is my religion
Quickly repentin' for my sinnin'
And it baffles me: how could you hate against the
Me, mighty Mo Thug, Thug Queen?
My Almighty Father keep me with deep beliefs
Chief and heavily, to release the stress off of me
Not enough artillery for you to
Fight against me and me Mo mighty

(Chorus)

[Souljah Boy]
Like Vagisil cream all off in your uterus
When I got full fists and I'm furious or delerious
Ain't no cure for the somebody ill with this
While I be villainous
Fin to ?, like 'em or not who gots to stop?
Then stop it, hold on, if you bustas wanna fight
Then you gots to go, or will they sniped
Oh, when he roll slow down his window?
Flyin' high like the Air Force
Sailin' like a sailboat, gotta get the bail on
'Til we soldiers buck up
Leather Face, do you got my back, boy?
Don't act up, comin' at ya
Mo Thug be platinum
They don't explain why you're hoverin'
Over Cleveland in a copter
Souljah Boy with the Glock cocked
And I told ya, it'd be hard to stop us
So proper, I'm a give it to you
Who want it?
When we go ridin' in, we gon' bring it
We gon' sing it, so the ? get tossed up, tossed up

(Chorus)

[Krayzie]
I'm a mighty, mighty warrior
(warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior)
With my mighty, mighty warriors
(warriors, warriors, warriors, warriors)
Hey (hey), Krayzie from Bone, brain fried and gone
But I'm mighty, mighty strong (strong)
We mighty Mo Thug
We mighty bet you better back up off me
Or be feelin' my mighty, mighty wrath
You better ask somebody
This how we get loud and crash the party
The party inside and nobody will hear the violent vibe
No longer quiet, go quiet, let's pump up the riot

(Chorus)[Ken Dawg]
It's Mo Thug, it's Ken Dawg
Let me lean on in your mind
Hit you one time
See, here it's Ken rollin' off this Hen
I got to do this shit again for these niggas
Who didn't think Ken was bringin' work
But now I got your eyes open, now, busta, stay alert
Prefer to smoke that hitter
Yeah, wig splitter, take two hits and pass
Cause it's that two hitter quiter
Did I hear a busta hatin'?
Cause he's violatin'
Why I got playas all around in my face fakin'
Mistakin' me for a fake?
Playa knowin' I ain't
I can't do that type of sucka shit
Cause I'm 'bout bank
Rollin' with a click that's straight puttin' it down
Playa get your smoke on to that Mo Thug sound, right

Nuthin' but the playa in me
It's nuthin' but the playa in me

[Ken Dawg]
You heard me puttin' it down from the C-Town
Playa, we heatin' niggas up, roll with click of playas
We're real street figures
Beat hustlas down if you ain't got my paper
And if there's no intention of payin' me
I'm a have to fade you, that's real
So, gon' and take it for what it's worth
Playa hatin' fellas on the outskirts
Mad a nigga done came up and did his thing
Now the topic of conversation  is Ken Dawg
Now, playa, if you lookin' tight
Then I'm gonna give you P's
I wish all of the playa haters would follow me
Rollin' high, passin' by, my mind will fly
The stress is far behind, and don't ask why
I'm Ken Dawg, my brother's gone I'm trying to deal
Every time I hit ya, I'm spittin' real shit
Real hits, so, y'all, go on and relax, (y'all)
All laid back in all them Cadillacs, right

Nuthin' but the playa in me
It's nuthin' but the playa in me

[Ken Dawg]
It's nuthin' but the playa in me at all times
I'm floatin' through the city in the droppin' twenty-five
I know y'all feel me
Don't spill the Henessey
Cause then you're gonna have to see me
Naw, I can't get like that about no drink
But I can get like that about my bank
And I be sayin' shit to make these niggas flip the script
Hear the hit, and that must've been it
I'm in it to win it, don't be P.O.in' on me
Rollin' through this madness all lonely
Niggas is actin' phony
Don't be like them regular competitors
Stressin' 'bout them tricks on the regular
I'm Ken Dawg, I'm doin' it to you right (right)
Every time I put it down
It's all tight (it's all tight)
We all high, we all high
Lit up, lit up, lit up
So, go on and get your hands up
Nigga, what?

Nuthin' but the playa in me
It's nuthin' but the playa in me
It's Mo Thug it's Ken Dawg
It's Parkwood
Yeah[Hook]
Ain't no reason for the games these hoes play

[Verse 1]
Nigga, it's the year for playa haters will be exposed
These niggas fallin' off going out for these hoes
Trick tellin' you what the fuck she gonna do
I keep on tryin' to tell you these hoes got game to
So where's your mack hand? wanna be mack man
Turn around, slap that bitch with a backhand
Damn, now your girl got ya cuffed on your way gone
Prepare to do about thirty days strong
See that homeboy, I told ya gotta be a soldier
Fuckin' with Cleveland, yeah, here to fold ya
Nigga, I'm for real about this shit that I spit
Off this Hen and drove my mind, always stay lit
Now what's happenin?
Cleveland in this bitch for real
I'm tryin' to look out for my dogs
Cause these hoes can kill
Trick, how you do yours behind close doors
Cause a nigga know about you on the down-low
I'm the player type, I lay it right off the jump
Puttin' some shit in your trunk that's gon' bump
But broad I really can't blame you
Playas will learn, these hoes got game too, righ

[Hook]
Ain't no reason for the games these hoes play

[Verse 2]
Now, I done seen these hoes come in all shapes and sizes
Fake to wise, ho don't mistake the height
Yeah, you got a downfall in someway or another
Tryin' to take out the next young brother
Lover of this man, greed, indeed
Sayin' you love to fuck, and smoke all his weed
Hey, that's the way life goes for these hoes
Playa, the next thing to stay up on your toes
Cause-a, like I told ya these hoes got game
Runnin' down a line of niggas like an Amtrak train
Can't explain why, I'm too busy high
Herb got my mind, seein' that I'm passin' em by
Mission impossible, cause these hoes simply incapable
Goin' for the cash, and dash first chance available
Bitch, really understand me
Ken D-A-W-G from the L-A-N-D
And I got game to come back on you twice as nice
Verbally hittin' your dome like it was a fight
Can't let me get all caught up in some shit
I let you know off the riff that I ain't havin' it, you hoes got game

[Hook]
Ain't no reason for the games these hoes play

[Verse 3]
I wonder, was this a setup?
Cause I know these nigga playa hatin'
You said there was money involved, waiting, huh
So now I come and see what it is
I handle my biz cause I gotta kid
And a, soon as leave out the door, I hear some shit
I didn't pay it no mind 'til I heard a click
What the fuck? These niggas tryin' to rob
Undercover setup bitch behind a job
Uh, had a nigga thinkin' it was about paper [damn]
Bitch, but this bitch was really on her caper
Now, I gotta wet up this bitch
Hope in the meantime, this ho get hit
Damn, ain't no reason for the games that you play
Don't wanna die today, but that's the price to pay
Uh, next time I pass up on that cash
Next time, I pass up on that ass
Bitch, tried to get me straight got
Ain't no reason for the shots, you done peep the plot
When the law come, I can't explain
Cause I'm gonna let you know that you hoes got game, right

[Hook]
Ain't no reason for these games these hoes play
It ain't no reason, this ain't the season[Cat Cody]
No, no, no, no, no
We ain't said no names, y'all
We know just who you are
And exactly why you came
Now wouldn't it be real fucked up
If we start namin' names?
We ain't said no names

[Krayzie]
I can remember back in the day
If you bit another nigga
You was considered a biter
Non-originality, simply disrespectin' a true rider
Nigga, I'm fired up
Nigga, keep on bitin' the Bone
And your jaw'll get wired up
Keep on lovin' my song
But my nigga, you ain't Bone
Can you understand what's wrong?
Better get on
Sayin' you been flowin' since back in the day
Some of you was
Well okay, but whatever it was you were stressin'
It wasn't effecting nobody like this way
Hit me, so niggas can miss me with they drama
Tell them all like Willie-D told niggas
"Bitch, play with your mama. Cause I'm not your toy."
So nigga don't test me, cause Krayzie ain't no sample
But really, could you handle
Big old slugs from these here magnum?
Ever since we came with Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Niggas been comin' up out the woods singin'
We stole they flow and song
If that's the case then why when we kick
Wicked shit, muthafuckas all like it?
And then why when you come tryin' to kick my shit
I can tell you strugglin' tryin'?
And back in the day how many niggas
Was really claimin' to be thugs?
Niggas was gangstas
So what the fuck done changed 'em? Huh?
What really be fuckin' my head up
Is when one nigga do somethin', come up
Make a Little bit of money, somebody all on your nuts
I'm keepin' it real, and bitch
If you Feel I'm talkin' bout you
Then it must be the guilt
I think we should give them the murder treatment
Yeah, that should learn 'em, baby

[Krayzie]
Oh, oh, we gonna kill them with the big shotgun
Yeah, fuck y'all niggas who's talkin', nigga
Niggas talkin' shit over here, nigga
Fuck y'all niggas wantin' to do it

Aw shit, these niggas done started over here
They talkin' shit, say we ain't rappin' (What?)
Niggas has got the nerve, and look who platinum
Niggas been runnin' off at the mouth
Before they think and look at the reality
I'm a speak on it, so bitch, be mad at me
Now first of all, y'all can't even talk
Y'all need to go get your speech right
And then while you at it
You need quit samplin' that bullshit
And get your beats tight
Let's meet up at midnight in the alley
Where nobody knowin' what's happenin'
What's happenin?
You wanna pull out some guns or do some rappin'?
A nigga don't want no problems
But then if he wants to cause it - a nine millimeter
Dawed-off, a .380, TEC-9, comin' out my closet
Probably only have to pull a muthafuckin' twenty-two
Probably just say "Boo!"
And watch you niggas scuffle, scatter everywhere
Them niggas up outta there
That studio shit been known
To give niggas like you wig-splits
I hear you talkin', woofin' nigga
But I really can't feel shit
Now face it, nigga, rap just ain't the same
Especially since my Mo Thug family encountered the game
The fame is pain, for this I'll pay the price
And niggas tryin' to take my life
Always feelin' violent vibes
Just because I'm shinin' now
In the hood, it was sarcastic shit like
"You paid now, been awhile since you came around."
So you tellin' me that I ain't down?
But first of all, when I was broke as fuck
You niggas did not give a fuck
Now all of the sudden
Ya lovin' me when we drunk, playa hata
We know who you are, can find out where you live
Better protect your kids
Fuck it, let's blow up his crib
10-o'clock news: "Nobody lived."

[Tombstone]
You better roll
Cause we give no love where we got to buck
Break you off somethin' proper with hate
I 'll break you off somethin' proper with love
It's all how you take it
We been never takin' no strippin'
For the body dippin'
Grips in the wasteland all from mad-testin'
Even though they know about death - a cold place to rest in

[Cat Cody]
We know just who you are
And exactly why you came
Now wouldn't it be real fucked up
If we start naming names?
We ain't said no names[Krayzie]
Believe
Believe me

[Layzie]
Just put your trust in me
Believe me, believe me
Just put your trust in me
Believe me

[Krayzie]
Gotta believe it

[MT5]
Let me show you love
Heaven sent above
Close your eyes and dream
Believe

Ooh, I believe every woman deserves
To see every once in a life a one-way ticket
No fantasies, so when you close your eyes
At night, the tears you fight
I wanna let you know
Everything's gonna be alright, alright
Alright, now, baby
Girl, I only wanna hold you, baby
Never shared some kind of lovin', baby
Our experience is beautiful, incredible
Let's take it slow
Take my hand and believe me, baby
Our love will last forever, lady
Cause you know everything will be alright
Ooh, baby

(Chorus)

[MT5]
What will it take for you to realize
It's through your eyes that I can see my destiny?
And through your pretty smile
I see your fears and insecurities
It's you and me 'til eternity
And now we're hand in hand
And your my girl, and I'm your man
Each day I'm thankin' God
Fulfilled my dreams, and fixed your heart
So, baby, close your eyes
And no more tears, and no more cries
You just gotta believe

(Chorus)

[Krayzie]
Thugs believe you can achieve the goal you're seekin'
If you really love it

[Layzie]
Get down for your thang and maintain
If you feel enough

[Krayzie]
...faith, you gotta have a little bit of faith
Just a little bit

[Layzie]
Parlay, be safe, and you can't forget to pray

[Krayzie]
Oh yeah, it's a struggle sometimes
But there's a lot of people steady goin' under
But I ain't the one to stumble
Me break, no crumble, ready to rumble
Fight for the right to unite and be humble
People all over the world...

[Layzie]
...follow me, cause I know the ride
And I will show you right

Stayin' on my mission, keepin' it focused
You gotsta play by the rules
That's why game paid my dues
Went to the top with my trues
You snooze, you lose
Now you know that
Quit actin' like you don't care
If you with it, and you prepared
Pump your fist up in the air
And holler Mo Thug love
It's my Mo Thug family

(Chorus)[Layzie]
Lil' Lay, hey (Yeah, yeah)
What's up playas (What's happenin' out there?)
Thugstas, and hustlas?
(Yeah, yeah, it's all real, yeah)

[Felecia]
And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Oh, you know it ain't easy
Yeah, you know it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(Don't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(Don't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game

[Layzie]
I lived in darkness for years
And barely can see through the smoke
At the end of my rope from sellin' that dope
Been makin' them dum-dums out of soap
And I hope to be a better man
Never did I understand what I had
My attitude mad, young and bad
Fila, Levis - still sportin' the sag
Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death
Wanna go home, but somethin' won't let me
Cause I know she got problems her chest
It's a struggle, a puzzle - the pieces so scattered
We find 'em, take your time and put it together
Nigga, quit walkin' around like you're blinded
Put your mind on your money, thug
Don't worry about what you got
Open your eyes, and peep the plot
Say your prayers, achieve a lot
Nigga, don't stop 'til you drop
Somewhere in a box, locked and buried
Other than that, my nigga, just smile
And don't worry (don't worry)

[Layzie] (Felecia)
And I want you to know (I want you know, yeah)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(You know it ain't easy, you know it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks

[Thug Queen]
Bow my head, askin' the Lord for change
Since I started sellin' 'cane
Shit ain't been the same
Began to acknowledge my bang ways
Who can I blame?
Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage
The otherside of the game
Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange - tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this
The Lord, I'd like to thank you for my Mo Thug family
Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

[Scant]
I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all: it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, "What you gonna do? What you gonna do?"
I said, "I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know."
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

[Layzie] (Felecia)
And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy, you know, you know ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain to the otherside of the game

[Sin]
Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors

[Ken Dawg]
I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hardtimes
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt--the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

[Flesh-N-Bone]
You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they wanna ask me
"Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?"
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

[Layzie] (Felecia)
And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy *it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah...)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game

[Mo! Hart]
Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battlescars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

[Krayzie]
Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

[Layzie] (Felecia)
And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(We can make it through the pain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game[Chorus]
Ghetto blues has got me down for the the last time

[Verse 1]
Strapped down with ghetto ways
Beggin' me to the extent of my struggles statis
They called me on the low
Comin' up on the money
Hustle, the same old thang for a new game to be played for cheese
Gotta get what's promised to a sister, comin' up on bankin' G's
Hustlin's all the same
I can't deal with these playas' thoughts
Too much trust and risks make quick for a fool to get caught
Hold on, slippin', too late to be trippin'
Weak strategies gettin' the best of me
Underpriced, everyday down and out is life in societies
Still, I hold on, cause I'm headstrong
And focus with life of no time to pay the price of failure
Let me tell you, no lie
Livin' by the strugglers' rules
Gotta do what ya gotta do that's fit
We strugglin', who gives a damn man bout this down and out chick?
My head poundin', what am I gonna do?
Gotta get on the hustle
Makin' the cheese comin' up out of the low-life of the ghetto
Gotta make this come up on the real, since tired of strugglin'
Ghetto life showin' me no love
But givin' me reason to make quick moves on somethin'
Gotta hold on my own, but it's hard as hell
Tryin' to stay afloat in "The Heart of it All"
So for myself, it's the way I go
I gotta do what gotta be done to make it in these hard times
Strugglin's a mother when you gotta wonder
"Can I provide for mine?"
Look at my predicament, who's gonna help this sister in need?
Can't put the trust in the system
So I gotta hustle these streets for my cheese
Gotta make that money comin' up on the means that's due
Cause one of these '96 days, I'm outta these ghetto blues

[Chorus]
Ghetto blues has got me down for the the last time

[Verse 2]
These ghetto blues done gotta sista faded
Prayed this was only a dream
Trapped in a slum surrounded by the crack fiends
Means of survival, I guess
Hustle in the hood, wear the bulletproof vest
Help me, Lord, I can't get no deeper than this
Wish I wasn't born in this world of bastards, misfits
Mom's got love for me, but she don't love what I do [ohh]
Gotta slang 9 to 5, don't bring in enough food
Steadily, look out for myself, my trues, and my family
See gotta go for self cause won't nobody take care of me
Strategy, keep fools out of my place gotta take care of my business
What is this?
II Tru, Playa hatas on the real, you betta get with this
Been down for too long
Come strong, fool, it's on
AJay's click comin' thick for the nine-six
Right down to the very bone, never laggin'
Eighty-six ghetto life, Eighty-six them ghetto blues
Trues comin' up for the nine-six
Playa hatas, you bound to lose
Break rules, ain't no laws here, playa
Understand ghetto blues, cause for moves testin' trues
But remember the man
Go home if you sensitive, gotta live, nothin' gives
Been in some strange situations
Comprehend since I had to do, so a sista did
Get rid of all excesses, always stay true to my trues
I can do this
Gotta shake these problems, get away from these ghetto blues

[Chorus]
Ghetto blues has got me down for the the last time

[Verse 3]
Right now
Time to get a nigga shit tight with the man in the mirror
See clear through the rest of my days on earth
Been piecin' puzzle since birth
And it only get worst until we layin' in the hearse
It's a ghetto curse
Every little kid in the hood done felt these tortures
Departure up out of this hell hole, nigga done fell low
Stressed, but I'm blessed as a soldier
I beg of you
Lord Jesus, help me deliver myself and my click from this evil
Fear the reeper surround in' my soul
Steadily sendin' these through my peoples
Heaven be takin' control of my destiny
I can't let these streets get the best of me
With all of my kids right next to me
You can expect for me to keep grindin' desperately
Calculatin' my every move
Gotta prove to these fools we confuse
Intention, do your thang and maintain the mission
Cause really, my trues can't settle for no prison sentence
So, I keep my distance from llello
Plottin, starin' out the window, looking for a rainbow
Lay Bone can't settle for the same 'ole
Claim Mo Thug with love to the depth that the game goes
Reviewing all possiblities, pesponsibilities is major now
Ain't no need on dwellin' where the danger bound
Shit'll change around if we make it, suit up
Two Glocks for the war, check the score
II Tru can't lose, cause you know we got shit to prove
Gotta stick for you, livin' our lives
Singin' these ghetto blues [blues]

[Chorus]
Ghetto blues has got me down for the the last timeYou betta count your money, you betta count your money
You betta count your money, you betta count your money
You betta count your money, you betta count your money
You betta count your money, you betta count your money
The name is Krazie, big bad ass bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter
That that there's kidnapped, now she was with her so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heep of trouble
Double crossed by the law so theres nobody to run to
Yeah its just me and my saw it off shotgun
Outlaw call him leather face
I'm headed for the west
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure thats enough time for me to get the whole run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin' dark so now now i'm watchin' for them damn Injuns
They like to catch us, then they rob and split
I be a rootin', tootin', shootin' damn fool, protecting my chips
All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse whhooaa Nellie
Who in the bushes you betta speak out
Or I'ma let my shotgun song sing out
Who is this? hope this ain't the law
Jumped out the bushes with my
Saw it off shotgun
Come on out right now I'm gettin' angry
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot its just me thug
Queen the horse stealer
Then why the hell is you hidin' them bushes
I'm wanted in four counties
For armed robberies
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law that's why I jumped in them bushes
Goodness, now she was hotter than the barrel of fire
But I could use her for the job so I told her to ride c'mon
May I ask you what you headed to the west for?
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you down you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you wit it
We hurry for the Sunrise
Gotta stallion, for ya parter to ride
Hit the saloon for the Moonshine
Down for whatever lets ride let's ride
These directions say we got to Tucson Arizona
When we arrive we cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the morning for details and hookups
You betta count your money, you betta count your money
You betta count your money, you betta count your money
Rise and shine, good morning howdy
Nine o clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now I done came along way I don't wanna be late

You betta count your money

I'm peepin Krazyie's warning posted in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glance across the room I see this youngster gettin' ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So I approach him at a pause
Look man I really don't wanna brawl, why don't you chill
Before the them laws come messing up this master plan
Since y'all 'ready rowdy I just ask ya man, hey
You want some work, well partna put in ya bid
Now by the way whats ya name? They call me Layzie the kid
The names powder P can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlawed everyday on the front page
Mr Kid, if you give me the low down
Me and Blackjack, we ready for the showdown
With two double barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm perdy clever
So saddle up jump on the bandwagon
Because its all goin down
I heard a guy run in the bar screaming Krayzies in town
Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside and dont' be stealin' nobodys damn horses
Stepped inside the bar, Layzie kid, you son of a gun
Hey man I'm glad you made it safely

...[Tre]
No one to turn to, no one to hold
My body misses your presence, come take full control
Come touch my lips, and let me kiss your fingertips
I wanna feel you inside of me, come and explode
I reminisce, don't believe I'm feelin' like this
Boy, you got me going in circles (circles)
I'll be damned, cause I don't understand
How can you take a piece of my heart (my heart)?
It may sound crazy, but it still amazes me
Took me from the very start (Hey, now)
The way you hold me, mama never told me it can be all so good
I guess some things just wasn't meant to be
Be under, be understood

I want here with me
I need you here with me
I love you endlessly
Oh, baby, can't you see?

[Tre]
I grab telephone, but I won't call
Don't believe it ain't killin' me, takin' my all
I smell your scent even though you're not around
Without your love, somethin's steadily pullin' me down
I can't resist now, can't believe I feel like this
There I go again in those circles (circles)
We got along, I should'na did you wrong
It didn't have to be this way (have to be this way)
And if ya come back to me
I won't have ? word to say [Hey, now]
A hey, now, I'm in the mood for you and only you
I swear that my love is true
And if ya don't give me another chance
Then, honey, what will I do?

I want you here with me
I need you here with me
I love you endlessly
Oh, baby, can't you see?

[Tre]
Touch my lips all inside
Callin' the hips of obsession right to ecstasy
Oh, baby, I want you here with me
I'm ready ,love me now, love me now, come and explode
Come and hold me as I sing this song (Love, love, love)
Love me now
Oh, I'm trapped in the heat of ecstasy
Love me now, so lonely
Oh, I'm so ready[Big Sloan]
Hey, hey...
Chka-chka-chk-ah...
Chka-chka-chk-ah...

[Chorus 2X: Mo Thugs]
Mo murder, mo murder! (murder)
We comin to serve yaaaaa (murder)
Mo murder, mo murder! (murder)
Mo murder, mo murder! (murder)

[Big Sloan]
I'm the hardest MC you ever heard in your life
Big Sloan and Layzie Bone homie, murder your wife
We come into your house and, leave your frame frozen
And tec smokin, 24's on a hang like Hulk Hogan
My group blow do's and 21 coast soldiers
Hit you hard in ya sternum, make ya chest touch ya shoulders
Hi Power vultures in a Caddy with coat vultures
Gorillas on the block that I bust off of stage coaches
California G's on, billboards and posters
Air Force Ones, black hoodies and Range Rovers
It's the takeover, on the block in a black Nova
With a sick-ass team with cats from Nova Scotia
A vest and two holsters, we pop like Orville Reden'
With 30-cals that flip like Mary Lou Retton
Uh-huh, you know we don't play them games
Lil' Lay and Big Sloan, yeah, spittin the flames

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Nigga I'ma be sleepin with my boots on when the war pop off
Waitin for the thieves tryin to creep, sneak and pop my locks off
Run up on me if you wanna, it be murder she wrote
I'd rather be judged by twelve than dead and left for broke
Pick up the phone, call Sloan, "Nigga come over quick
Cause there's some bustas in the mix wanna have me carried by six
Bring the guns and extra clips, nigga watch a nigga flip"
We won't stop until they hit, fuck it, murder yo' clique
You know them bullets ain't got no names on 'em, they ain't prejudice dude
I ain't lyin, I ain't dyin, 'til I'm scheduled to
I'm ahead of you by two steps, maybe fo', five, six
Like Green Bay I lead the +Pack+, what'chu know 'bout this?
Niggas know my hits, this ain't the first time I said it
Quick to leave a body shredded and yo' kids beheaded
Got a mil', nigga bet it, and I'm takin it all
Niggas lames, they pathetic, I'm not takin the fall

[Chorus]

[Thin C]
It's a goddamn shame how we do these lames
Got the game on lock like shackles and chains
Mold a man up on your block, yes, once again
Enough beans to turn a crook into an honest man
One squeeze sends men to the promised land
Black hoodies, black boots, black guns, black clips
You get all that shit if you fuck with my chips
You get all that shit if you fuck with my chips bitch

[Dre Ghost]
There's a hell of a lot of ways to die, do somethin
Bullshittin'll have your life set up to lose somethin, uhh
Prove somethin, uhh, 'fore you take your last breath
Or those couple of steps, uhh
Catch a nigga by the drum baby, and leave him alone
He'll bleed in front of his children
And scope out haters' situations
It's all Mo Thug and that's how we do it baby, killers

[Chorus]Kill'em all, kill'em all, kill'em all
Dey die, dey die, dey die, dey die
They wanna see the Bone gone
They wanna see the Bone gone
They wanna see the Bone gone
They wanna see the Bones long gone

Murda, bloody murda
(It's ya nigga) It's ya nigga Leatherface
So murda's on until the break of dawn
They yellin' and screamin'
It's Krayzie, that's my name
That's my name, that's my name
Makin' mothafuckas feel the pain
Time to die, caught up with Mr. Sawed-off Leatherface
What a hell of a day
Is he real? Is he real?
Nigga, tell me, is he real?
Could ya pull it, then spray?
This Mo Thug organization
We causin' much destruction, destruction, destruction
Listen to the sound of me 12 gauge eruption, eruption, eruption

Cuz we can, you know what I'm sayin?

Hey, nigga, I feel like this
You know what I'm sayin?
Fuck it, nigga, it's all about them Bone thug-ass niggas
You know what I'm sayin?

[Third Krayzie]
Muthafuck the police, always
No muthafuckin' thugs, ya know what I'm sayin'
Fuck the muthafuckin' police
Nigga, comin' straight from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
No regards for the muthafuckin' law at all
Nigga, eternal warfare

Hey, it's alright
It's alright
Tell me do you want to come and play with me?
Do you want to play, (play, play)?
Roll (roll) with the gun in me hand (hand)
And they can't understand that
We ran with the murda mo, murda mo, murda mo
Rippin' them guts and drippin' that blood (blodd, blood)

Fin to get 'em with the pump and peel ya
Buck'em up until ya
Ya body's so badly damaged that you're not familiar
Who killed ya?
That nigga with the leather face (Who?)
They will never know, cause he won't show
Leatherface is identified
See the murda all in his eyes

You can't hide
This murder is the world
(There's no escapin' murder. There's no escapin' death)
No, no, no, you can't hide. This murder is the world
(There's no escapin' murder. There's no escapin' death)

You mercy screams are not needed
Too late when you proceed to bleed blood, yeah
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill'em all
Artillery, that's what ya got to have to fuck with me
Murder mo, come come, dey done, meet redrum

It's all right
If you want to come and play with me
And when you meet the sawed-off
Just say, "Mr." Nigga, when you meet the sawed-off
Just say, "Mr. Leatherface, Leatherface, Leatherface"
Nigga, "Leatherface, Leatherface, Leatherface"
Die, die, die...Yeah, Poetic Hustla'z (Hustla, Hustla)
Thought we was gon' fall?
Right back at ya
Yeah, yeah (Hustla, Hustla...)
Aw, shit

(Chorus)
I'm just a Hustla from C-Town
And my life's been turned around
Cause we're Mo Thuggin', Mo Thuggin
We're Mo Thuggin, Mo Thuggin'

[Boogy Nikke]
Niggas gettin' recruited
Holdin' guns, cause they comin' for me
Drinkin' my love, because the trust is muthafucka
(Would ya die for me?)
FBI: Fuckin' Bitches In need
Try not see me innocent, on Hennessy, niggas
It's time to breathe, Mo Thug to the top
We be the best, muthafucka
Giddyup 'fore I touch ya
Never trust y'all for nothin'
The Lord done blessed me, muthafucka
Got the tear to show it, busta
Cleveland rock, muthafucka
Hall of Fame to the top, non-stop
What the fuck you wanna do, bitch?
Lovin' my people, I'd die for my people
I pray for my people
Bitch, what?
And don't test the muthafuckin' Boogy tight as shit
Muthafuckas better pray
Bitch, y'all dyin' and shit
A muthafucka out there
Did slit my nigga T-Rock (we are Mo Thug)
And rest in peace, and when I find 'em
I'm a rip 'em, I'm put my teardrop on it
Yeah, and rest in peace, and to his mama
His dada, I'm paranoid, now

(Chorus)

[Tony Tone]
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
Is my life really movin' too fast?
Cause I'm feelin' all the jealous
Bitch-made suckas that didn't think we would last
Nineteen-ninety four, we was on the go
And that's for sure
I know you hope and prayin'
That this Mo Thug click don't grow more
But, bitch, we too strong
We hold on, connected by our bones
And let them niggas burn in Hell
That killed my nigga, Tombstone
Your name will live on, and everyday I must say
I do pray, but I wonder why it has to be this way
Trials and tribulations everyday
Cause Lord, You done bless me with my kids
Don't punish them for the shit that I did
I'm thuggin', that's the way it is
It's crazy livin' life in the streets
That's showbiz, separatin' your friends from foes
And ends and hoes, but those don't know
Don't fuck with pros
These Cleveland bros is ready to roll
Everyday strugglin' to make a winnin' where we fit in
No matter what the situation may be
We still on top
Goin' down in history, Mo Thuggin'

(Chorus)

[Mo! Hart]
Rememberin' the days when times were hard
Hittin' the streets, hustlin' from dusk 'til dawn
My family was right there, right there by my side
No second thoughts ever on our muthafuckin' minds
Doin' what's necessary to keep our fuckin' pockets fat
Our own personal security to watch our backs
Representin' to the fullest
Got my right fist high in the sky
Yeah, you know what it is - Mo Thug 'til I die
Just a Hustla from C-Town, straight doin' my thang
I'm one of the last original thugs
So these nuts must hang
We don't take no shit
Never hestitate to split a nigga's wig
Or for that matter, fuck his bitch
I love for my Mo Thug brothers and sisters
Them was days, and you know that
They will always be with us
Gettin' brewed to keep it all together
Dueces on a square, playa
(Dueces, dueces. I'm next, playa I'm next. I'm next, playa)

(Chorus)[Preacher 1]
We believe that it is better
To love than to hate (Air raid siren. Thunder)
At the same time, we warn this nation that our
People are growing tired and they are growing restless

[Krayzie]
The mighty, mighty, mighty
Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty Mo
The mighty, mighty, mighty
Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty Mo

[Felicia]
Mighty mighty

[Preacher 2]
These are the things that we about tired of
We wanna bring the truth to light and let it shine

[Krayzie]
You could ride if you want to
Or you could die if you want to
But I don't want to
Fuck it, c'mon and ride

[Felicia]
It ain't nothin' but a thang
If you wanna hang with the Mo Thug family
Rippin' shit up, tearin' down walls
Gettin' suited up for the cause
You can roll with us
Or we can roll without you
It's all up to you, so what ya gonna do?
Mo Thug comin' through, so make way

[Preacher 3]
And there's no need of runnin'
And no need of sayin'
"Honey, I'm not gonna get in the mess."
Because, if you were born in
America, you were born in the mess

[Krayzie]
You could ride (ride) if you want to
Or you could die (die) if you want to
But I don't want to
Fuck it, c'mon and ride

[Preacher 4]
We've got to walk together children
We can't get wearyDamn man, I see all them mothafuckin police, dogg

Mothafuckaz). These bitches and
Niggas, shit. Let's take they mothafuckin head off, right here

Load this mothafucka
Damn, nigga, it's comin off. It's on. It's on. What's up? What's
Up, mothafucka (you mothafucka
Fuck you, get up)

Chorus
(gimme some back up) (this way, that way) We no surrender, we no
Pretender, we bang bang (8x)

Jhaz (from II Tru):
We no surrenda, no pretenda, II Tru, my crew come thick
Family behind us, you don't wanna see this Mo Thug clique
Too swift to be faded, just hated by them foes
Throw blows, bow down hoes, Mo Thug handle this like pros

I'm too cold, neva catch me slippin', mothafuck a set up
II Tru to my dyin day, rollin' wit A.J., Mo Thug love, nigga what
You got yo blue suit, yo got yo nine
But if you pop one time, my true's comin' back uptight and I'ma end mines

I'm nothin', but, one ah the best females
Pumpin' in yo ear, fillin' tha air, wit nothin' but potent ass bud smells

Tombstone:
We strapped with Bone hit the deck, on the worst of the wreck
Strapped with the .38 and TEC, hey man how we love them TEC's
Ain't gotta dump 'em, but when we find the muthafuckin' snitch
Lynch 'em, head straight for the ditch

Victims say we got a snake to snitch
Goin' to the cut so we can break the bitch

How you want the nigga, red on on this blue suit, fried
When he died we showed the nigga he could never ride
Or fuck with the souljahs that glide on the Clair side
Runnin' with gauges, flippin' your pages, fuck the cages

Shoulda known not to fuck with the thugs all militant
Hell yeah we chill but we ill to defence of livin'
Still can't help the way we roll, in the land so cold
Eveybody's singin' the devil's song along the road

Boogy Nikke:
I'm takin' the lives of all them seargents, lieutenants we pin this
How far are you willing to go, when you test us we test nuts boy
Better part the sea and pin the scriptures we read 'em
Gotta get 'em where it hurt, gotta get their kids first, now my subject be the envy in me

I'm wantin' your soul to burn in hell, and dwell and tell the past who put you there
Your family was soon to follow, as I complete my intro on your people
God bless the children though, it was business never personal
Better pray to the Lord for your soul, run away through the tunnel of the light, can you see me, see me

Krayzie Bone:
Boy you better believe it, your people f'in' to feel it when the coffin top drop, the box lock shut
Toss 'em in the back of the hearse, and I wish I could watch the cop's crooked body rott
And thugs will all in time takeover the world, collect the minds of all the little girls and boys
And pearls to a another dimension, where really is just us, fuck the system, is ya feelin' me now

Cause I ain't got time, to be fuckin' with the street weak leakin' mind
You know it's cool to be thuggin' on '99, I parlay break bustas and niggas that's on the grind
Niggas tryin' to creep up on ah come up, but I betcha nigga come my way you sprayed
You knew we was real, we really do smoke blunts, we do all our own stunts, fuck cops a whole bunch

So they wanna die, so we f'in' to kill 'em, hit the copper chop 'em up with the M-11, now feel the pain
We the T-H-U-G be fuckin' souljah, niggas is sure we got the real shit for ya
Never respect 'em ready to blow 'em out ya town now, come on y'all we take a pow pow
That gauge that gauge we spray they lay they lay, what a wonderful day

Get up buck and fuck 'em on up, when they pull you to side and they tryin' to put the cuffs on
That's the perfect time to get it pump, then you reach up in the glove, hold your breath then get ya buss on
Let 'em feel the round, or hear the sound, of the twelve gauge eruption
Destruction we've made, now the peelin' is through and we got your pay

We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bangYeah, E-M-T (it ain't no rules!)

[Chorus 2X: E-Mortal Thugs]
Throwin flagrants you fakers keep fakin, usin 'bows
To keep off you haters as the penalties create injuries
You niggas be killin me with this negative energy
Sack you niggas like quarterbacks, send you straight to surgery
(It ain't no rules!)

[PD]
I'ma step when it comes to the game, slip, I'ma dominate
Fuck ya, if ya wanna hate, injure niggas that's in the way
Rules I never heard of them, use 'em and I'm still hurtin ya
You's a small area, whole area, I heard of ya
You gettin neglected plus rejected so expect some chin-checkin
If you bring it you'll get total disrespected
My squad is the money man, Layzie and the henchmen
Mo Thugs the fam, hot damn like a Van Damme
Y'all best know, who you dealin with, niggas on some other shit
We come to get it, move over, we runnin shit (it ain't no rules!)

[Chorus]

[Lil D]
I'm star stu-stu-stuttered like Ruben Studdard
Keep a German Rueger when I move through public
Assets with baguettes, I mean you dudes should run it
Glasses with two tecs, we laugh; a casket, who want it?
Given distributin them speedknots
Headlocks, ribshots, leg locks, head shots, follow my plot
I'ma pop it, feelin my profit, today's topic, cocked it and popped it
Fuck it, stop it, in my category that ain't a option
Constantly boxin knockin opposin opponents unconscious
Turn your blue suit to a red suit and use you as a sponsor nigga
(It ain't no rules!)

[Chorus]

[Stew Deez]
Aw shit, y'all niggas done bust y'all up
All of y'all niggas finna get fucked up
We throwin 'bows at you hoes, ain't no rules so anything goes
We Bobby Boucher'n niggas, my hobby be sprayin niggas
My motto "No playin nigga" so fuck what you sayin nigga
Up out your mouth you get knocked out
From the first damn round it's goin down
Like Iron Mike Tyson nigga, we knockin your jaw around
I'm knockin you black and blue, E-M-T is smackin you, Lil' Lay is jackin you
For everything you got, so give it up or get shot, nigga
Cause when it come to these streets my niggas roll, we roll deep
With SK's and AK's up in the front seat (it ain't no rules!)

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
So many melodies, better be 'bout the cheddar cheese
Layzie, E-Mortal Thuggin like criminals is the felonies
Y'all better be watchin y'all back, off the rip, I come with gats
Bang bang, do the damn thang, I'm a O.G. nigga handle that (buck buck!)
With a scandal that I will murder y'all
Ain't no rules, I ain't heard of y'all
Line 'em up nigga knock 'em down, fuck 'em all nigga serve 'em all
Bone Thugs to the Harmony, Mo Thug is my Family
It's real in the streets, you feelin me?
We the rawest clique on the planet see
Forever a menace so put it in Guiness, you better go check my manuscript
(Motherfuckers) Yeah (c'mon) you better go check my manuscript

[Chorus][4-U-2-Know]
Finally got ourselves together
You ain't on, too damn cold
And we're pimpin' it
Pimpin' ain't easy for a lady
So we do what we gotta do
Cause we're II Tru to it

[MT5]
I've been really tryin' to pimp so strong
Cause I know pimps comin'
Swingin' on the scene, and now
But we gotta stop, it don't matter
Just keep it wild, so just pimp it on
I said just pimp it on

[Jhaz]
Mama gave me free game
Long before was I was true
Break Jhaz? Never, back it up
And break yourself, fool
Play my hand the tightest
Had this nigga think he bawlin'
(You ain't bawlin', you ain't bawlin')
Pinnin' never, yo
This Jhaz doin' the shot-callin'
People tendin' to think that
Women only gettin' tricked
It's ninety-eight y'all
And women out here now as pimps
Every women knows all men carry egos
Number one reason why they ass
So susceptible, feel me though
Make him think he all that, in fact
Use your talent: every woman born knowin' how to act
Female macks (female mackin')
Just tell this nigga what to do
Play it off like it's a question
At the end of it say, "Boo, I love you, too."
When I get through
Y'all best believe we violent
'Til he break hisself, dog
Pimpin' ain't easy

[4-U-2-Know]
Pimpin' ain't easy for a lady
But we do what we gotta do
Cause we're II Tru to it

[MT5]
See, only the strong survive in this game
You gotta be...

['Brina]
Pimpin' ain't never been easy
For a lady until you met this new breed
Ain't takin' no shorts from these chumps
Make playas follow my lead
Got money to make with no intentions on settlin' for broke
Commitmentes from cluckers, countin' my riches
Call me 'Brina, pimpin' this bitch
Brothers gon' splurge on his last piece cash
He got (that's right) in his pockets
Keep bustin', but best believe no strings attached
So my ass gonna clock a sack
And stay by bein' in charge
I'm a play my cards to my advantage
Pimp niggas run the game and leave room
For me to use your scant-ass
You gonna treat me like a lady? (That's right)
The question is: is you gon' pay me?
You could front for ya balls
In reality we makin' babies
That's shadspspeecghey, knowin' behind doors
Only thing we do is sit and trip
Never once with that speech
Can we kick it on me, you're 'bout to hit
This pimpin' ain't easy, but I'm all about it
Straight pickin', keep clockin' so I'm strong
Better bring me all my damn money

[4-U-2-Know]
Pimpin' ain't easy for a lady
But we do what we gotta do
Cause we're II Tru to it

[MT5]
If you didn't know
There's two pimps on the scene for sure
And they pimpin' on
I say they pimpin' strong
II Tru pimpin' on

[Jhaz]
Pimpin' never easy for a woman
It gets worse these knuckle-head-ass niggas
Only make my job the tougher;
Boy, you's a worker
So don't act funny 'bout my cash
Bring it home to mama
Before I eighty-six that ass, and do it fast
Don't play me like you didn't know
You's a male hood rat
How could you ever be my ho?
Really, though, I know
You thought you had me in a trance...

['Brina]
Goin' all out to please me
And wanna be the one to get the pants
Understand: what's yours is mine
And what's mine and mine
Ain't got no time to settle down
Before you know it, I'm dippin' outta town
It'd be lyin' if it ain't about the money
Call me a gold digger
Don't be caught sleepin' try to run game on me, sonny
Pimps act is: attract niggas to females
But the catch is reverse roles
Keep male hoes on they toes in 'Brina's pimp biz

[4-U-2-Know] (MT5)
Finally got ourselves together
(Come on, come on, just pimpin' on, pimpin' on)
You ain't on, too damn cold
(Just pimpin' on, just pimpin' on
We goin' strong, we just pimpin' on)
And we're pimpin' it
Pimpin' ain't easy for a lady
(Come on, II Tru, pimpin' it on)
But we do what we gotta do
(They just pimpin' on)
Cause we're II Tru to it
(II Tru comin' in and pimpin' it on)
