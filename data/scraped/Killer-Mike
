[Intro: Zack De La Rocha]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them
Fuck the slow mo

[Verse 1: Killer Mike (El-P)]
Fashion slave, you protestin' to get in a fuckin' look book
Everything I scribble's like an anarchist's cookbook
(Look good, posin' in the centerfold of Crook Book)
Black on black on black with the ski mask, that is my crook look
How you like my stylin' bruh? ain't nobody smilin' bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh
Where my thuggers and my crippers and my blooders and my brothers?
When you niggas gon' unite and kill the police, mothafuckas?
And take over a jail, give them COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur, goddamn I love the smell
Now get to pillow torchin', where the fuck the warden?
And when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him
We killin' them for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em

[Verse 2: El-P (Killer Mike)]
We out a order, your honor, you're out a order
This whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a clip wig synonym livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian, I'm fucked from the jump
I wear my Yankee so tilted I actually walk with a hunch
Look at Mikey, I think he likey, we are sinister sons
(And we the type to greet the preacher with a grin and a gun)

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them

[Verse 3: El-P (Killer Mike)]
A wise man once said, ("We all dead, fuck it")
Just spit it disgustin' youngin' and hold your nuts while you gunnin'
I listened, tatted the sentence on my dick last summer
Now I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin', waitin' for the christenin'
I know the neighbors can't help but listen in
A dirty boy who come down on the side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison
The only solace I have is the act of conjugal visiting

[Verse 4: Killer Mike (El-P)]
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Though mainly missin' my missus, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is given vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers and slavers of men and women
Including members of clergy that rule on you through religion
(He'll strip your kids to the nude and then tell 'em God will forgive 'em)

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha]

[Verse 5: Zack De La Rocha]
It's De La on the cut,lifting six on your snitching crew
I'm miles ahead of you, you can sip my bitches brew
My battle status is burning mansions from Dallas to Malibu
Check my résumé, your residence is residue
Call her a skin job and my honey dip will backflip for you
You playin' God, your eye sockets she gon' rip into
We sick of bleeding now trey spray and victim you
Done dyin', Phillip AK Dick in you
With clips in the bottom, we dipping through Gotham
Yes eclipsed by the shadows, a dark dance to the coffin
I'm a fellow with melanin, suspect of a felony
Rip like Rakim Allah, feds be checkin' my melody
Yes aggressively testin' with bunk stretches and penalties
Dump cases when facing to cop pleas when we seizing the pump
With reason to dump on you global grand dragons
Still piling fast bucks, Afghani toe taggin'
Know they trackin' me cause we bustin' back, see
The only thing that close quicker than our caskets be the factories

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Bunches and bunches
Punches is thrown until you’re frontless
Oodles and oodles
Bang bullets at suckers' noodles
Last album voodoo
Proved that we was fuckin' brutal
I’m talking crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo
You rappers doodoo
Baby shit, just basic boo boo
I’m Shaka Zulu
Mansa Musa, my money's buku
My beats is bangin’
Fuck what you rappin
Who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got
And Run The Jewels you

[Verse 2: El-P]
You itsy bitsy
Furry frightened
And fricken' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for Winter swimming
Look at these kiddies, Mike
I'm a rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work
Do the deed and then dash
Ditch 'em I'd lend a hand but they stuck in a fist and gun position
We run a brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It’s all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear in the smoke
Like we're fucking magicians

[Verse 3: Killer Mike & (El-P)]
No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers
(We might be giants, standing on little dandy shoulders)
You punks is pussy proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake ‘em, DDT ‘em in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my colosseum
(They all actors, giving top in back of a BM
I’d fall back if the casting calls are ending in semen)

[Verse 4: EL-P]
I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluation
I'm a phallus, a Johnson, a jimmy spraying faces
Any cow that is sacred will get defaced
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced
Face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you're like, "Mellow out, man, just relax, it's really not that complicated"
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just insane as you explained
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is deranged

[Verse 5: Killer Mike]
This Run The Jewels is
Murder, mayhem, melodic music
Psychotics use it to lose it
Junkies simply abuse
That's word to Phillip Seymour Hoff' and I'm kushin'
Coughin'
I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin
The gates of hell are pugnaciously pacin'
Waitin'
I give a fuck if I'm late, tell Satan be patient
But I ain't here for durations, I'm just taking vacations
And tell him fuck him, I never loved him and salutations[Intro]
Darling-d-d-darling
Dar-dar-dar-dar-d-ling
Oh my
Oh my

[Verse 1: El-P]
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp
Hol up
(You are now listening to Run the Jewels 2)
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick,  that's word to Pimp
I don't fuck with or talk, like all these fuckin' imps
Style violent,  give a fuck if you deny it, kids
You can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit, that's word to B.I.G
I dreamt we owned the world, but I've woken up and it don't exist, Soak it in, I need no assist, you can't slap my wrist, I don't owe you shit
Trust me, I'm a doctor
DOOM, oper-
Rate of my pulse, won't raise a bit

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Tip-toe on the track like a ballerina
Ski mask, in a Pontiac Catalina
It's obese, female opera singer
You can run the jewels, or lose your fingers
Me and El-P got time to kill, got folks to kill, on overkill
He hangin' out the window, I hold the wheel
One black, one white, we shoot to kill
That fuckboy life about to be repealed
That fuckboy shit about to be repelled fuckboy Jihad, kill infidels
Allah Akbar, boom from Mike and El

[Verse 3: El-P]
Life is hell, death's a bitch and these fubar rulers getting rich
I cop a zip, it opens up, I smoke it up, go home and fuck
C'est la vie girl, when in Rome
I gave the face, please pay with dome
My business card says you're in luck
I do two things, I rap and fuck

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
I fuck and rap
I tote the strap, I smoke the kush, I beat the puss
I read the books, did the math
Don't need a preacher preachin' on my behalf
No teacher can teach my arrogant ass
I'm blowin' on crippy while readin' inscriptions that's written by Egyptians and sippin' on whiskey
Ay, baby you with me?

[Hook]
Oh my
Don't cry (x4)

[Verse 5: El-P]
[Whip Crack]
We run this spot like a Chinese sweatshop
Don't stop, work it work it till chest pop
Cardiac arrested, I'm so invested I'm self-invented, that no illusion, there's no confusion you see the future, you fear the future
I've seen the truth and I'm so deluded
I been a better bad guy than I been better than bad
Been a bit a bully talk beating in my chest in fact
I'm a half stack from a rack
I been around the block, babe, I know a few facts
Maniac, brainiac, run go tell them that
ATLien, NY felon rap

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Handle me wrong I'm snappin'
Show up at your class, what's happenin'?
Schoolyard bully with a fully automatic
Heart full of pain and a head full of havoc
Everybody stepped on the kid and I'm letting them have it
Havoc
Leaving they momma to say "what happened?"
Who gon buy my baby a casket?
Fuck that bitch I'm a bastard

[Verse 7: El-P]
Megablast, I'm mega lit
On Highway 6 and I'm not strapped in
I don't crash, bitch, I just skid
You got the cash, I'll make the trip
I make the trip, you better pay
Done worse for less, don't make my day
I'm not from Earth, from far away
I bust through chests like baby greys

[Verse 8: Killer Mike]
Runnin' the jewels of the game
Whippin' the mix is like chickens of 'caine
Spittin' the sentence again
Parents is livid again
Kids is just fuckin' insane
Pointin' that pistol and fist for the chain
Reppin the symbol like they in a gang
Delivery dope like a dosage of dope or a noseful of coke for a junkie or fiend

[Hook]
Oh my
Don't cry(x2)[Verse 1: El-P]
Oh dear what the fuck have we here?
These motherfuckers all thorn no rose
Egads what a bad dream better not sleep
Take a No-Doz, do some blow
Oh shit what the hell have we done?
It's alive and it's hungry as fuck
Better hide all the snacks and the dough
It is out of my control, you are shit out of luck
I don't wanna be unfair but the pair
We got beat that weak shit you got (true god)
Blew up the spot with that new bop
Crew drops, do up ya squad without nuance
I don't wanna sound unkind but the
Sounds I make are the sounds of the hounds
That are howlin - Under your bed I'm here growling
Same time under the blanket you're cowering

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Cowering like cowards cowering on
Concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's wilding
We often smile at sights of violence
Acting brave and courageous
Ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say run the jewels
Just run' em baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady
The fam god damn we fuckin crazy
I'll pull this pistol
Put it on your poodle or your fuckin baby
She clutched the pearls, said "What in the world!"
And "I won't give up shit!"
I put the pistol on that poodle
And I shot that bitch

[Hook]
Run the jewels...(x2)

[Verse 3: El-P]
And the crowd chants "Get that paper!"
And the mob says "Kill that witch!"
This city get mad to the max
Better wave bye-de bye to the high scrapes kids
Get a tin foil hat for the rain, in
Hot water from the roof to the basement
I'mma smoke 'til the planet erases
Build a white flag out of Zig Zags, wave it

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Often I'm smoking coffin
Sip lean on a bean like Boston
My young bitch here fine like
Pam Grier when she made that movie Coffy
But when my wife's in town
Ay Jackie Brown just stay up off me
Cause if they don't somebody get shot
And they gon' buy a coffin

[Verse 5: El-P]
With the pull of a pin a grenade
Get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win I been made
To be loud while these other cats drowning in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk get accosted
I'm a sin on the verse like a kid in a hearse
Or a nun in a cum shot (stop it)

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Big beast in a cage with a heart
Full of rage, it seems I can't behave
You could try till you die, oh well
You failed, it seems the world can't be saved
These streets is full with the wolves
That starve for the week so they after the weak
In a land full of lambs I am
And I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth

[Hook][Verse 1: El-P]
Smoke from the loosie drift
Hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of bein' excellent the median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold
Authorities have spoken, demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground while the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano, y'all know, kinda bat shit
The bright lights of fuckery stuck in me automatic
I’ll tea bag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who’ll swim like directly after he's eaten
While holding a toaster oven that's plugged with a fork in it
Cause death by electrocution's like life in New York, isn't it?
Shoulda been a dentist, mom said it
Pain's the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors that I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop I can chop it up with exacto touch
Whats the rush?
Autograph skin flaps, tag em up
I don't brag enough you de facto suck
A lotta you new to the El Producto milieu
Kinda like “fuck is you?”
I'm a little black spot on a sun of lies
But I'm not too high to say I'm the truth
I line the booth to catch blood like a Bateman
Nothing sacred I’ll mace a play pen
Jewel runner bitch make the name stick
Not for sale but I'm takin payments

[Hook: Killer Mike]
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
(Everybody's doin’ it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
Everybody doin’ it
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
(Everybody's doin’ it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I’m fly as a pegasus, that’s no embellishment
I’m here to pain the whole game, where the Excedrin
Good pussy, good marijuana that be my medicine
And I’m a mixture of MJG and the Weathermen
A revolutionary bangin' on my adversaries
And I love Dr. King but violence might be necessary
Cause when you live on MLK and it gets very scary
You might have to pull your AK, send one to the cemetery
We overworked, underpaid, and we underprivileged
They love us, they love us (why?)
Because we feed the village
You really made it or just became a prisoner of privilege?
You willing to share that information that you’ve been given?
Like who really run this?
Like who really run that man that say he run this?
Who who really run that man that say he run this
Run run run run this?
Like who really fund this?
Like who really fund who say he fund this?
Like who in the world gon' tell Donald Sterl who to put on the “you can’t come” list?
Now don’t be silly
Who the fuck gon' bully me if I got a billi?
If I got a billi and the bitch recording me I’m like who cares
What I wouldn’t be is on TV stutterin' ta-ta-talkin' scared
So the question is when Don’s at home with that traitor ass bitch alone
Who’s that voice on the side of the phone that shakes and rattles his bones?
Could it be the man behind the man behind the man behind the throne?
Gone

[Hook]

Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Reminiscin-in' on our time of innocence
When we drank that Hennessy, ate on lamb and venison
Face fucked you in your kitchenette, fucked you like we tusslin'
Do you fuck your husb-al-and? Like, do y'all be tusslin'?
Do you wear the muzzlin'? Do you ask him pretty please?
Do you crawl on hands and knees, like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl, the world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else, I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this, pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin', I think I'm in love again
Found my perfect drug again, feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance, 2 Live Crew the narrative
And there it is

[Hook: Killer Mike & Gangsta Boo]
I put that dick in her mouth all day
She got that (dick in her mouth all day)
She take that (dick in her mouth all day)
(She said she wanted my, wanted my)
Dick in her mouth all day, day
I give her that (dick in her mouth all day)
She play with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She want that (dick in her mouth all day)
I think I'm in love again (Love again)

[Verse 2: El-P]
Here I am, my love
Just like when we first hooked up
Feeling like I'm animal
Feeling like you're edible
Bendable
I been away
I don't have too much to say
You say say it anyway
I say take your shit off I'm not playing bae
You little freak
What you are is so unique
Smart and full of filth and joy
You been with some little boys
Now you're with a grown-up man
One who'll actually understands
Kid gloves are not on my hands
I will never condescend
Now spread yourself
She smiled a bit
Gripped the outline of my shit
Oh, my god, I love this chick
I must put my tongue in this
Into every space I go
Give me everything you am
She said, "No, you gimme first"
That was like a day ago
8 AM
She still got my

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
That's what you want huh?
Well let me tell you a little story
I had a young player from the hood
Lick my pussy real good
Kept me stuck with lots of wood
Kept my bank account on swoll
Sniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro
Made a porn tape, that nigga is a pro, you ain't know?
He had a lot of bad bitches in his past
But I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man
His tongue is bomb
And he love for me to ride his face
Front to back, grippin' ass
Pay my bills, where I live, fuck me good
Broke ass niggas killing me
I'm about my money, ho
Never been a square bitch
He ain't paying? Hit the fuckin' door
Talking slick, that Memphis shit
I be from that Haven click
Keep it ratchet so sweet
All these boys kiss my feet
I be on that queen shit
You better bless my realness
Stick your tongue up in my ass
You better show me who you fuckin' with
Run The Jewels
Love again, you gon' lose, I'm gon' win
Let's have an orgy
I'mma share your ass with all my friends (Yeah, ho!)

[Hook 2: Gangsta Boo]
He want this clit in his mouth all day
He want this clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I've got this I've got this fool in love again (Yeah ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I put my clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
He want this clit in his mouth all day
I've got this fool in love again (Love again)[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
It be feelin' like the life that I’m livin' man out of control
Like every day I’m in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine’s the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask “why you’re here?”
I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that’s what it is
He chimed “you got a dime?
I said “Man, I’m tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don’t lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife
Man, I ain’t got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
Cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son”
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said “shut up”
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and
Put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk
And hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
Cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

[Hook: Boots]
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this way, feeling this way
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Feeling this, feeling this early
Early (x4)

[Verse 2: El-P]
It be feelin' like the life that I’m living man, I don’t control
Cause every day I’m in a fight for my soul
All hands below, high seas in a rickety boat
Smoke o’s so the kid might cope
You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don’t pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y’all
That the true truth’s truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth’s truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording
But didn’t record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched cop make girl bleed
Go to home, go to sleep, up again early

[Hook][Intro - Killer Mike (Shawty Lo)]
Saying that you from here
You don't never come here
Saying that you from here
You don't never come here
Saying that you from here
You don't never come here
(Well goddamn!
There must be 2 sides)

[Verse 1 - Killer Mike]
Too many niggas running 'round here lying
Claiming my city and they ain't from mine
A-town niggas so real, so raw
My bloodline is [???] by law
My pedigree is souls on three
Souls on one, souls on four
In other words fuckboy I ain't no ho
Nigga, I'm known at the AAMCO
Where the dope gets sold and the hammers blow
Steal at the store where you grandma go
You know the same store where you can't go
Cause you ain't go, stop lying ho
Niggas see dumb niggas eyein' yo'
Piece and chain, 'bout to blow your brain
You wanna G up but you can't
Real niggas do what a fuckboy can't
Come through 'hood in wet-ass paint
Leave the car running with a filled up tank
Let a motherfucker try and touch my Chevy
Guarantee that I'ma put four in his belly
Two in his chest and a few in his neck
Then I dip back out to the flat
West-side OG that be me
Martin Luther King on my ID
Shawty Lo and T.I.P
Both know me from the goddamn streets
Now ask your favourite rapper 'bout me
No, ask your favourite d-boy about me
Ask Lil' Lean, ask Fat Steez
Ask Sleepy and Young Pill
All they gonna tell you is I keep it real
I put that shit on Adamsville

[Hook - Killer Mike (Shawty Lo)]
You say you from the west-side?
(Well goddamn! There must be 2 sides)
You say you from the east-Side?
(Well goddamn! There must be 2 sides)
You say you from the south-side?
(Well goddamn! There must be 2 sides)
You say you from the north-side?
(Well goddam! There must be 2 sides)

[Verse 2 - Killer Mike]
West-side bound but I'm east-side found
Ask them Glenwood boys I'm 'round
Who is these east-side niggas you 'round?
Ain't never, ever seen none of 'em clowns
I don't never see 'em on Candler Road
In east with that [???]
Nigga steady saying he from Decatur
Pussy, you's a fucking faker
I'ma ask them niggas on Marve Road
I'ma ask them niggas on Memorial
I'ma ask them niggas on Panola Road
If the niggas don't know, I'ma ask some hoes
Why? Cause you pussy, nigga
I ain't no pussy nigga
Think I am then push me, nigga
Wet me up and dush me, nigga
Up shopping in south DeKalb
South DeKalb with a [???]
Or Candler Road, Red Lobster cracking
With my east-side mobster faction
Might see me with on a Kirkwood block
With a east-side Chevy rider named Big Block
Or [Moderm] Ave. with my top on drop
Radio on Pac just gripping my cock
Gripping my Glock and gripping my grain
On [Crumington Highway - ???] getting some brain
[Raymore Drive - ???], I made my name
Slinging that pure Bolivian 'caine
Making some change two years before
The older bitch came two years after
Met Gucci Mane through DJ Funk and Daryl James
I'm real with it mayne

[Hook]

[Outro - Killer Mike]
Saying that you from here
You don't never come here
X9[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Bitch we be that shit that's right
Number two boo boo straight caca (yeah)
I smoke ganja with a dreadlocked rasta
Move like Frank you will die like a hassa
Move like Jesus die like a martyr
Hell of a choice when you're riding on the MARTA
Trying to get some hoes in the hot car
How far is we away, man? Not far
The greatness they claim, not all
Are not, we are those juggernauts
Me El, we hail
Like a young Che Guevara and Fidel
Castro, cash flow, car full of females
Bad hoes, we in the DR
Any fuck rapper boy gettin' out of line I pray the preacher beat him to the goddamn ER

I spit them country rap tunes like Hee-Haw
Cocaine flow fishscale no re-rock
Take a snort for yourself shawty, see? "he raw...
(sniff) See he raw!"
That’s you shawty go on snort your nose off
Then put the news in the street Tom Brokaw
Cause of you shawty met a bad stone bitch out of Brooklyn and that Brooklyn bitch straight got broke off
Yeah she called her homegirl from the BX, freaky lil 'Rican brought X and we sexed
Couple months later brought 'em down to Atlanta and let 'em style on the 'bamas that's right yeah we flex
Heard she got a baby daddy and a nigga acting aggy runnin' round talkin' 'bout yeah he plexed
Nigga better pray for a ho like he Tebow though cause right now he stay losin’ like The Jets

[Hook: El-P]
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain

[Verse 2: El-P]
Bitch we be that shit that's right
Light a flare put your thumbs in the air high five
I came for the stash box gimme that
I been waitin' for this all my life
3 AM and I'm still not right
Still awake still away from fading
Crazy
Psilocybin
Why the ride so hazy
Dribble this spit till the street gets wavy
The bliss and pure shit magician
Get to skipping
Not too tall dark and handsome man
But I talk dark for ransoms man
Spend grands of those zombies
Folded origami
Yes I bag the clams
Anyone object to the styles, get a smile and a backwards hand

Peep that, venomous fangs on the face of an angel
Bringing that buckshot back to the table
Been a veteran, earthbound hellion
Try to say grace get a face full of staples
Woke up and the city air smelled like maple
If you come straight from New York you relate
If you come straight from another place stay tuned
Me and Mike got the whole map held safe

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Be it NYC or the ATL
From the ceilings of heaven to the gates of hell
We murder death killed every stage we step
Homicide times two better warn yourself, El

[Verse 4: El-P]
Anybody looking for some trouble better self med
We could double dutch in a minefield, hell gets
Just the right temperature, break beat minister
Riverdance cleats on your face for the finisher[Verse 1: El-P]
That was me in BK on Atlantic
Never looked both ways, ran in traffic
Pops went away but I stayed, vagrant
Placed where the steel and cement became nature
Love what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous
Cityscape where the blood of good men courses
And the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain
Take a knee to the gods and get horse shit
Wanna live for the thrill? They'll arrange it
Got a bevy of imps to spit hatred
Shit'll get in your head and cause panic
Have you desperately begging to get famous
Get your dignity dirty and left orphaned
Sanity on the fringe of distorted
Who are they to just take shit and hoard it?
Who am I that I don't get my portion?
The most impressionable minds get molested and informed by manipulating forces
Don't fret little man, don't cry, they can never take the energy inside you were born with
Knowing that, understand you could never be poor
You already won the war, you were born rich
You can only take the energy you had
Going back to the realm or the home where your lord is
Whoever whatever that lord is couldn't
Give a fuck if you ever made fortunes
Fuck anyone ever trying to run that bum shit
Send 'em to the flames where the orcs live
Them and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us
Don't understand love's importance
And we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth
Where the ashes and dust got formed in

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
The beat breaks and your teeth break
Keep your canines embedded in my knuckles as a keepsake
It would seem your veneers just mere souvenirs falling out your mouth and on to the landscape
Me and El-P do the secret handshake
Then I pummel punch a pumpkin head punk in his pimple face
'Till he's punch drunk cause he's sweet as a pound cake
(Ain't he pussy, Mike?) Yeah, El, I'll say
Into the wild, wildstyle ghetto child running wild
Where the lions and the owls stay
The powers that be even offered up reprieves
Told us they ain't take us out if we bow to our knees
But they can give that to the kings and the queens
And the worshipers of idols and followers of things
Cause I would rather be in the jungle with the savages
It's kill or be killed, and I'm working with the averages
My professor emeritus
Say we been cursed being brought to the Americas
How you raise a whole human single parent, no marriages no sense of heritage
Planned Parenthood helping plan miscarriages
But I'm lucky mommy already had a narrative
Product of a teenage love, my arrogance
Derives from the pride in the job my parents did
Named Mike, I was told it was godlike
Even danced with the devil, came out alright
OK, honor y'all? No way
Still spell Amerikkka with the triple K
Word up to Spice 1 and O'Shea
And any MC peeping what I go through
Real rap, my last line's so true
Rest in peace to Pimp C and Camu, too
We do it for you[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jacking off cause you ain't there

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Cruising down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talking bout meeting at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em a good game, juju pimping
Give em to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S
A D. and an A. missin' out my Adidas
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumping brooms

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, boom

[Hook][Intro: Andre 3000]
Yeah! Killer keeps it honest
Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach
Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of hell (Boo!)
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
K-I-L-L
This is the name that came to alter the game
Not like these rappers who spit it the same
Separate lames from they chain
My mind don't slack
I'm totally focused on beating up tracks
Monsterous music to beat in your 'Lac
1000 watt amp with woofers in back
Lean to da left if you burning a sac
Baby got back and its in Baby Phat
Pardon me dog 4 chasing the cat
I'm hittin all kittens meowing like that
I like the front but I'm loving the back
I like to bite and I'm hoping she scratch
Escalade dipping I'm holding the lane
Mama's a scholar she blowing my brain
Ain't that the life?
Snapping & Trappin and Rappin & Frappin all night
Lil mama's a plumber she handling pipe
Ill wit a pill she handle it right
Like Iverson, the smallest thing on the team
But the livest one
Cocked loaded bust like a gun
Y'all better run, one, one!

[Hook: Killer Mike & Big Boi]
Thump, thump, thump, thump (yeah)
All in your trunk (yeah)
Grinding and hustling and getting at mine
Swerving and token and grippin on pine

Bump, bump, bump, bump
All in your trunk
Woofers and tweeters and speakers and geekers
Crawl in your bunk

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
How we gon' stop (whooa)
How we gone quit (shitttt!)
Brand new shoes and socks on the Chevy
I came through swerving like this (errrrr!)
Good wit the game, gutter fo' show
Ducking you lames and obstacles
Don't get that ass in a hospital
Wrapped in a cast from head to toe
This boy he real!
Racing those candy Sevilles through Dixie Hills
My car do wheelies they drive on three wheels
First round pick like Michael Vick
Quarterback status throw passes at chicks
Santana Moss When catching the ball
Get it? Like Moss she catches the ball
Perfectly tuned my engine don't stall
And I'm equipped with nitros y'all
Ready to rip, burn, roar!
Ready to tear through your city and tour
Took The Whole World and murdered that shit!
Caught the beat running and dipped with that bitch!
Later for now I'm hustling hits
Flipping my words like bricks, trick!

[Hook]

[Outro]
New, new! That new-new!
New-new for you-you!
New-new for you-you!

That new-new! That new-new!
New-new for you-you!
New-new for you-you![Intro - Andre 3000] + (Killer Mike)
(Let's do this {shit})
Yeah! Killer keeps it honest
Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach
Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of {hell} (Boo!)
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale
(YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!)

[Killer Mike]
Madden 04
This is the name that came, to alter the game
My quarterback fires, slangin' that thang
Two minute drill, we runnin' it mayne
DEFENSE, DON'T SLACK!
Pushin' ya line, crackin' ya quarterback
Laying that wood, he's flat on his back
Ya receivers is shook, missin' they catch
My receiver's a dog, run and they fetch
Ya runningbacks weak, left on his neck
MADDEN IS IT, YEAH!
No better feeling, then gripping the stick
Returning my punts, nailing my kicks
My runningbacks real, fakin' is sick
HALFBACK, DON'T STOP!
Touchdown bound, Jeff, follow his block
My offensive line, locking the block
Fourth and inches, we can't be stopped
Third and long, we stretching the field
Chasin the corner, see if he chill
OFFENSE, WON'T STOP, NO!
DEFENSE, WON'T STOP, NO!
Yeah we braggin, and hitting and taggin'
On Madden 2004, YEAH!

[Hook - Killer Mike]
Madden 04, (YEAH!)
It's grime time, let's go (YEAH!)
Bringin the pain, I'm laying the wood
Quarterback status, I'm throwing it good
Madden 04, (YEAH!)
It's grime time, let's go (YEAH!)
Runnin' and gunnin', and stuffin' the hole
Nothin' is realer than 2004!

This year we iller than a nun in a cumshot
Gettin’ double penetrated in a dope spot
By two hard pipe hittin’ niggas
On the orders of Marcellus to the soundtrack of 2pac
I’ll beat you to a pulp no fiction
Tarantino flow new Jules and Vincent
Blow marijuana smoke no incense
Exhale in the face of innocent infants
On some "Ah hah look what I did" shit
And if I get stopped by a crooked ass cop I'm a put a bullet in a pig
And Rin Tin Tin, ah hah hah look what I did again
We the hooligans outside of school again
Sayin don’t be a fool never follow rules again
We the bad boys bully with the fully that
The teachers say ain’t shit and in the need of discipline
We the goddamn reason for ritalin
In the back of the class, twitchin’ and fidgetin’
Dead wrong we never got along
We laughed at the kids that was active participants
Bad boy walk right past church with the work in a bag
And a bible of Gideon
Got suspended for bullyin' a bully
When I go back to class I'ma punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again

[Hook]
Cause you get no respect

[Verse 2: El-P]
I don't flirt with greatness I wifed it in Vegas
The shits all paid for I signed the papers
Used to date but then I made her my main bitch
Bought us a place on a lake with some acreage
And Mike's my neighbor straight from Greatville
Any invader get slayed and stay killed
On sovereign land, Mike fill the safe up
We call when the fam get paid a great thrill
I Bad News Bear hug beats then creep off
You drive a rape van
Mullet Ray-Bans
We do Vicious
You do witness
You don't clap shit you's a cricket
Run the J’s we don't run so much it’s all fun and games till my J’s get scuffed
I'm livid, fuming, out of touch
I wear sweatpants to funerals, guns to lunch
Close the blinds they got drones and mines we so close to the lie I can almost die
I got no goals left but to save my mind
They got more holes dug In the earth, oh my
The beat get abused like I rock a wife beater
Drinker, fired by the company
Friday, late on the car note tryna do taxes
This my house it's high or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway

[Hook]

[Verse 3: El-P]
I'm a thrill killer, I will test you
Just like daddy fuckin' left you
It’s all your fault, mommy's lonely
You’re a burden, she needs rescue

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Hey little buddy, where’s your mommy?
Call me stepdad or Uncle Johnny
Here’s a dollar don’t follow behind me
I gotta go bang out mom and auntie

[Verse 5: El-P]
I hunt lions, tigers, rare vaginas
Hang where the cops seem scared to find us
Pop stars peep the bars and rewind us
Fuck your life but first run the diamonds
From the jungle (the jungle) the brothers (the brothers)
Can't relate to your first world struggles
You want safety, hugs and cuddles
IED’s will leave bloody puddles

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Woke up in Nigeria
Kicked out America
Case of malaria
Shit got scarier
Got left with a gun and a pitbull terrier
And a note from my dad said I hope God carry ya
Fought one or two wars while I made It to the shores
Y’know back to the home of a rock in Georgia
To return as a king, Michael the benevolent
Gold draped ridin' on the neck of an elephant

[Hook][Verse 1: 8Ball]
Myself at all times, I’m so allergic to phony
One of a kind, original, means I’m the one and only
God put me here to be humble and help my family survive
Sometimes I’m a victim of ignorance in my own pride
The devil be workin’ on me, I make it so easy for him
God be talkin’ to me, I light up the weed and ignore him
Money be on my mind, so much I hurt the ones I love
I move four hundred of stacks and rarely do it because of the love
My cock, it conjures me like it’s bigger than all that small talk
That’s why my listeners be so rapped up in 8Ball's thoughts
I target just how I see the sense verse that melt the surface
Seem like the lack of love have given the industry beat on purpose
I brush my shoulders off and keep it unique whatever I speak
Somebody must like me cause every album I did leaked
Content harsh, my heart won’t let me talk it soft
You niggers is ready or friendly, find something else to talk about

[Hook]
I’m allergic to phony, I’m allergic to fakes
I’m allergic to suckers, I’m allergic to snakes
I’ll be sneezing and coughing
Got me coughing and choking
Thank your fuckin’ which is pimpin’ boy, you must be jokin’

I’m allergic to phony, I’m allergic to fakes
I’m allergic to suckers, I’m allergic to snakes
I’ll be sneezing and coughing
Got me coughing and choking
Thank your fuckin’ which is pimpin’ boy, you must be jokin’

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I’m from the land of the trill, Port Arthur Texas the city
Where bras beyond the black option, they gut the gangsters get greedy
From the jets on the west side where they throw up their sets
To the east where they put in work with no kinds of regrets
I’m sayin’ so many thangs the average foul couldn’t handle
See brother killed brother, pull out his lights like a candle
Seein’ gangsters turned into suckers in ten seconds flat
Because it ain’t just where you from, is where the fuck are you at
But if there’s one that I’ve learned in all my time in this game
Is don’t make hopes niggers and ho shit take you out of your lane
So from the shit I refrain, before weak dudes I’m a verdict
I’m the king of the trill so if you ain’t real I’m allergic
Bitch move around

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
These boys ain’t official, they soft as a tissue
They claimin’ they mean but they fuckin’ the bitch
They claimin’ they bang but they colors are changin'
They stitchin’ the Kafka, eliminate thing
These rappers is lame, these rappers are liars
How could you be at this fraudulent guys
Before I do that I will find me a job
Or find me a fake ball and grab of the rod
It could be her, it could be him
If they’re good then it could be them
But that would be me cause I’m opposite that
Opposite line, opposite wet
Never a liar, I’m right and exact
Exactly right when I’m rippin’ the mike
The life I recite is exactly mine
The logical sight is exactly high
See first she was trippin’ and rippin’ and grippin’
And now you’re his what? And drunkin’ the thugs
Seeing you suckers is driving me crazy
False and phony, but fake for days
If I see you posers you’d better pray that I’ll never catch you alone
I’m grabbin’ that tone and puttin’ that bullet
Right through your b-b-b-bone

[Hook][Intro: Killer Mike]
(Paul is dead)
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for...One time for...
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for the...One, one-one-one

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
One time for the pill and the reefer man
It's the young black leader to the people, man
If you’re girl’s fine, nigga might eat her, man
I'm talkin' middle of the mall like a pita, man
A Nigga sky high now like Jesus, man
And oh Lord this reefer so potent
Got an anti gravity, a Nigga stay floatin'
This nigga rob me, bitch you must be jokin'
Like pow pow pow leave your chestplate open
One half the best tag team ever
Them other fellas all right we better
Anybody disagree they jealous
And anybody don’t just motherfucking yellow (just yellow)
Fuck a boss I’m the goddamn owner
And I smell like YSL and marijuana
Don Draper with the paper might pull a slick caper
Secretary told me "fuck you," I told her you gonna

[Hook]
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch
(All my life)
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch

[Verse 2: EL-P]
Sharp like knife
Bet a buck I’m stuck in the guts of the night
And I’m (ready on the right)
Please pass that already, alright
Get fetti, he’s steady on the mic
What the fuck else can he do right?
Step armed heavy and he brought Mike
Never step light, no fair fights
We got the drugs y'all wanted
Take a suck on the tail of a comet
I’m so high you a hobbit
Dick level, please back up off it
Better off dead like Paul is
Your name don't Ring, go Starrless
Me and Mike we a friend to the farmers
The weed run out, we might cop your whole harvest

[Hook]

Go! (x32)[PRELUDE]
(Radio Announcer) "The American dream had a price tag ... and only one man in a million was hungry enough to pay"
Hey man, you can save that morality for your minister
And you can save that speech for the sisters of the church
This is America, jack
This is all about corporate takeovers and money makeovers
Wealth matters and poverty doesn't
We all say we love Martin Luther King, but we all wanna live like Don King, don't we?
God bless America! God bless America!
Home of the Rockefellers, home of the Carnegies
Home of the end justifies the means, legitimized through larceny
"Fuck the king! Fuck your taxes!" is what they told their masters
Before they became our masters
So rebelling against power is natural
And being an outlaw is actually ...

[HOOK]
My American dreams, my American schemes
Fueled by American greed
My American dreams, my American schemes
Fueled by American dreams
It's American me, it's American me
By any means necessary
American me, my American dreams
Fueled by American schemes
It's American me

[VERSE 1]
In America the crooks get the castles
Never see a Rothschild or Rockefeller shackled
While Rockefeller Drug Laws keep us in a shackle
Eventually this weed'll be as legal as tobacco
By then every CEO I hope will be a black, though
Message to the felon, keep sellin', my brethren
The end of an era soon coming I tell 'em
Bumpy Johnson showed us the way, don't fail him
Big Meech united all the streets, they jailed him
Pablo fought the government so they killed him
Probably took his bricks and brought 'em to us to deal 'em
My critics say I celebrate the dope dealer ... probably
Cause I'm pro whatever prevents me from feeling poverty
For the same reason Prescott Bush worked with Nazis
The same reason Kennedy's dad ran the rum
By any means necessary I will overcome

[HOOK]

You become a sociopath flipping birds
The same mindstate it takes to build a Bilderberg
Or an Enron or any other big con
That could fleece a million people out of billions
I'm trying to get a cheaper price, you know, a bigger bag
Mexican work ... how American is that?
As American as steering in a German car
Fucking a Russian chick snorting coke from Colombia[Verse 1: El-P]
A little toast to the no ones
With a nod to the masters
To the ones with the riches
From the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys
A little nod to the spirits
We're still here runnin' round screaming
They're still here pointing and laughin'
Don't walk away when I talk
I'm tellin' you
Turn around mister
I got a permanent bop
Who the hell do I think I am not
And I'm twice as hot
As about half of hell
I get lighthouse lit up
Get down diduck
The boy got a barracuda bite
You can tell

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Got hope for the living
Got prayers for the dead
In the sky got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain
Cause the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane
Anchor themselves with angel dust
Somewhere between love and lust
A nut get bust
And a baby get made
It seems that trouble trouble us and follow us
Like all our days
In every holy book it says we suffer that's what it is
So riddle me this from the womb to the tomb why do
We fight to live

[Hook 1: EL-P]
(RTJ)
A little toast to the no ones

[Verse 3: El-P]
You say you wanna be my leader
I think you wanna be my God
You say you on the side of the righteous
I say I'm gonna hang with the wrong
There's truth where the filth is
There's lies in the law
You want a whore with a white dress
I want a wife in a thong
You love fear and division
I ain't fuck with your symbolism
I don't give a fuck about power
I'll pluck an eye out a pyramid
Cut a ear from a mouse hat
Go Van Gogh on a house rat
Find another mind to devour
Motherfucker I'm really not hearin' it

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
A pope is a fraud
A church is a lie
A queen is the same damn thing
You should pray to your fake god that she die
God really exists I tell you like this it reside inside
And anybody tell you different, just selling you religion, tryin' to keep your ass in line
I kill my masters
I mentor none
That means when I die that's it
My style is gone I'm a one of one
One half of the great RTJ
Defeated the odds went to war with the gods
Earned all our scars and came back straight

[Hook 1: EL-P]
[Hook 2: Killer Mike]

Angel Dust
Angel Dust

[Piano outro]I gotta get out of here, this city’s gonna kill me
Could be anywhere, anywhere but here
I wonder how long before this shit gone take me under

[Verse 1]
Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman moving through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as I'm passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him (Queens)
Forty one times, he committed no crime
But I guess life ain't Times Square
But in the city that’s gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayor’s a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it
And Brooklyn, keep on taking it
Cause life just ain't that fair
For the kids in the park, watching out for the Narcs
Blowing Sour Diesel in the air
Tryin' to flip them a pack, stack up a couple racks
And make it the hell outta here… (New York)

[Hook]
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me, out to me
I can hear them calling out

[Bridge]
Let the city peel away
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me!

[Verse 2]
I maneuver through the ATL in a black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though it’s black top from the mayor to the cops
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house, no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward, these young black boys
Seem to self-sabatoge they selves
Or maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston, well it kills itself... (Atlanta)

[Hook]
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many clouds in the sky
I can hear them calling out to me
I can hear them calling out
Anywhere but here[Killer Mike]
I'm sittin' at the top, I got a bird's eye view
Downtown condo purchased by the birds I flew
Actually I purchased this with the words I drew
Reminiscin' on the days when the birds I flew
Bird flu money got a nigga hot like fever
Life's a cold bitch but I ain't ever trying to leave her
I'mma get them dollars, pour bottles and fuck some models
Write a song about it, do the same shit tomorrow
Ay I tried to tell my bitch that I can't sit or fuckin' nap
Till I'm sitting on top like a Braves fitted cap
Got my name jumpin' out the floor and straight up through the roof
Now I got them hoes jumpin' out their clothes and in the coupe
Then I take 'em to the condo, rip 'em all, cut 'em loose
Tell 'em see y'all in the morning ladies I got shit to do
Then it's back to the money, to the hustle and the griz-ind
If a bitch think she trumps that she's out her motherfucking miz-zind

[Hook]

[Killer Mike]
Hoes used to laugh, said a nigga look like Re-Run
Now these bitches sweating me on MTV and re-runs
Now them hoes is lucky to get in the club that we run
Now I shine and ball on a bitch, neon neon
She play her husband like a peon just to get peed on
Tell my patna Sleepy, can't believe the shit that we on
Cold hearted macks for the stacks we pumpin' freon
Space age pimpin' with that above and beyond
Pimpin' like a young 8Ball or MJG son
Pimpin' harder, riding a foreign, not no Nissan
Ride in black and white Benz, look like a penguin
New woman wit' me flew in from Cali but she from England
She model, pretty, long black hair, and do some singin'
She better than whoever but never had a hit record
She wanna get together and get married forever
I thought about Kelis and said no bitch I'm 'bout my cheddar[Killer Mike]
CRIP - true blue to it
BLOOD - Piru to it
Gangsta music, is to drug abusin
Don't confuse it with C. Delores Tucker
FUCK her, and Bill O'Reilly
And Reverend what's-his-name, FUCK his name
Kobe the best player ever, wit NO game
Fell for the trick of that white bitch, so lame
How lame? Lame as the new host of Soul Train
Sheeit, lame as the old host of Soul Train
I do gangsta music, FUCK Soul Train!
All blacks got is BET
Pardon me, that shit's owned by MTV
Blacks ain't got shit, it's still 1-9-6-6
Cause you can buy a car ain't shit
Jordan cain't buy a team, and that nigga got six rings
Cot'picker, see what I mean?
Q-Tip's singin, Dre 3000 actin
God-damn, niggas too good, for this rappin
I'm just askin, what the fuck happened?
I'm just askin, nigga what the fuck happened?!
We went from "too black to too skrong"
To Sisqo and the God-damn "Thong Song"
We went from Farrakhan to Don Juan
Don Juan keep it pimpin man
But I'm just sayin Farrakhan got business man
Plus he speak positive on that knowledge shit
No matter how much my auntie holla
I'd NEVER give a dollar, to the good doctor - Reverend Creflo Dollar
Fuck dat! Befo' I do dat
I'd join Mason Betha's church and quit rap
I'd hang out with Murder INC. and sing 50 Cent raps
50 Cent raps; I'd rather let Eminem call me 50 niggas
Than break bread wit a rich nigga readin scripture
By the way, if you're Aryan Nation - FUCK Hitler, FUCK Hitler!
That's to let ya know I didn't forget ya
Let me make ya bad day a worst day
Me and Hitler got the same damn birthday
That cracker dead, that's my God-damn birthday
Go shorty, go shorty
FUCK a protest, I got a Glock 40
Unlike these bougie niggas, I ain't braggin
FUCK killin blacks, I'm down for toe taggin Grand Dragon, Grand Dragon[Hook 2x]
I can make your bad day your worst day
And I can wet you up if you thirsty
Stay trappin' on a tuesday to thursday
You should've known not to try me in the first place

[Killer Mike]
CRIP - true blue to it
BLOOD - Piru to it
Gangsta music, it's your drug, abuse it
Don't confuse it with C. Delores Tucker
FUCK her, and Bill O'Reilly
And Reverend what's-his-name, FUCK his name
Kobe the best player ever, wit' NO game
Fell for the trick of that white bitch, so lame
How lame? Lame as the new host of Soul Train
Sheeit, lame as the old host of Soul Train
I do gangsta music, FUCK Soul Train!
All blacks got is BET
Pardon me, that shit's owned by MTV
Blacks ain't got shit, it's still 1-9-6-6
Cause you can buy a car ain't shit
Jordan can't buy a team, and that nigga got six rings
Cotton picker, see what I mean?
Q-Tip's singin', Dre 3000 actin'
God-damn, niggas too good, for this rappin'
I'm just askin', what the fuck happened?
I'm just askin', nigga what the fuck happened?!
We went from "too black too skrong"
To Sisqo and the God-damn "Thong Song"
We went from Farrakhan to Don Juan
Don Juan keep it pimpin man
But I'm just sayin Farrakhan got business man
Plus he speak positive on that knowledge shit
No matter how much my auntie holla
I'd NEVER give a dollar, to the good doctor - Reverend Creflo Dollar
Fuck dat! Befo' I do dat
I'd join Mason Betha's church and quit rap
I'd hang out with Murder INC. and sing 50 Cent raps
50 Cent raps; I'd rather let Eminem call me 50 niggas
Than break bread wit' a rich nigga readin scripture
By the way, if you're Aryan Nation - FUCK Hitler, FUCK Hitler!
That's to let ya know I didn't forget ya
Let me make ya bad day ya worst day
Me and Hitler got the same damn birthday
That cracker dead, that's my God-damn birthday
Go shorty, go shorty
FUCK a protest, I got a Glock 40

FUCK killin blacks, I'm down for toe taggin Grand Dragons, Grand Dragons

[Hook]

[Ice Cube]
It's fucked up out there in Louisiana
Mississippi, Alabama, peace to David Banner
Peace to Master P and my young nigga Juvie
Mr. President, nigga this ain't a movie
Get off your ass, put down your uzi
You white motherfuckers move slow as Bob Cousy
Black people dying drowning on Bourbon Street
Blow the levees let the water come murder me
Run to the Superdome, it's like a slaveship
No food, no water, can't take it
Mama didn't make it
Little sister went to the bathroom, came back stripped naked
What the fuck is going on in the Superdome?
Don't forget about the man on the super throne
Hurricanes leave the West Coast of Africa
Hit the slave land man then they cause a massacre
They can make your bad day your worst day
Feed the people dumb motherfucker they thirsty
Been up in this hellhole nigga since thursday
Never should believe these fools in the first place
They can make your bad day your worst day
Feed the people dumb motherfucker they thirsty
Been up in this hellhole nigga since thursday
Never should believe these fools in the first place[Produced by No I.D.]

[Chorus 1: Snoh Aalegra]
I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

[Chorus 2: Snoh Aalegra]
I’m in a nightmare having a dream
I got a question, am I who I seem?
I’m out the matrix from battlin’ me
I’m dipped in all black shadowing me

[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
Something undefined is now taking over me
Who am I to fight me for my own soul?
I’m saying yes to things that usually are no for me
I kiss the neon night and let it have control

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge: Snoh Aalegra]
Why do I feel so free when I’m killin’ me?
I’m fallin’ to the sky caught between all the lines

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2: Snoh Aalegra]
I get so sad at myself
When I love what’s bad for my health
I wanna do right and I would
But wrong taste and feels so good

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
I'm the most honest liar, give me a matchbook
I'll light a fire just to see the flame go higher
I bought a box of Swishers, burned a forest
I told my partners that I quit but man I'm still pourin'
I told my girl I'm chillin', shit, but man I'm still whorin'
My killer country lingo make these women treat me single
They mingle with amigo, head, yeah and it's on
And I ain't ever hit her, but yeah I got some dome, gone
To my next adventure, exts you was textin', but can't exit with you
I said I love you, girl please, I was messin' with you
The E must have had me Xin' with you
Molly and a mirror wanna have me flexin' on you
Cause baby I'm a liar, cheater, killer, willer, dealer
Who love sinnin' like the lord must love a righteous figure
I'll rob a church and a bank for a righteous figure
So bad that even Satan say, "I don't like this nigga"

[Chorus 1] + [Verse 2][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Yeah, motherfucker I'm back from the dead
Driving like a bat out of hell in a red
Caprice classic, I spit acid
I don't rap ringtones, I flow classics
I am dirty south hip-hop, what's happening?
True shit talking, you ain't into battling
You know I let the gun go like a gatling
Favorite fucking rappers I am embarrassing
God in the building, nigga, ain't no comparison
I don't need swagger, I'm just arrogant
Martin Luther King Drive made me this way
And I've been real G before Atlanta went gay
I'm down by law, what more can I say?
Got a new AK, a new Chevorlet
Now which fuck boy on the block wanna play?
I'm the best fucking rapper you will find in the A

[Hook]
Grind Time Rap Gang, they're those guys
The truth and the whole truth, they don't lie
They just do (do), do (do), they don't try
And if anybody had a problem, they gonna ride
Like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Sidekicks hate, they don't wanna see me conquer
Fired my boss, I don't need no sponsor
Truck jewelry got me looking tough like Tonka
Robber try to touch, lose his arm like in Rwanda
In the concrete jungle, you prey or a hunter
When you kill a nigga, they say his soul haunts ya
I'd rather sleep with a ghost than sleep with the fish
Be judged by twelve, than carried by six
Rapper, walk like a man, and ride a nigga dick
Forty-five got the king size jeans on sag
Don't make me put another skull & cross on the flag
Grind Time Rap Gang rep that flag
Bang bang bang, the mack on your ass
Charging with the hemi going vroom vroom fast
Head full of smoke every packet got cash
No love for the haters you can kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Leader of the Grind Time get money Rap Gang
Dope-ass flows, lyrically, I'm cocaine
Dope dick for the bitches, dope lyrics for the dope mang
King Kong is the beast man, no cage, no chain
Top of the world, white girl in my left hand
Some monkey-ass niggas better hear me, clearly
Any mother fucker ain't rappin' payin' dearly
I'm talking weekly, monthly, yearly
Until you punk motherfuckers learn to fear me
I'm on some G shit; I've got a G card
I hit a nigga head, leave his ass a retard
I have his momma saying "No, take me lord!"
Preacher in the pulpit, the choir sings
And on the first row a momma cries and leans
The young fella had to die, it's a goddamn shame
But it's Grind Time Rap Gang, bang bang bang

[Hook][Charles Manson talking]
You've got it stuck in your brain that I murdered somebody. What do you want to call me a murderer for? I've never killed anyone. I don't need to kill anyone. I think it. I have it HERE

[Killer Mike]
I got hate in my heart, hate in my stomach
CO's make me vomit
I'm in the belly of the beast
And it made me a beast, it's too much to stomach

[Charles Manson talking]
Maybe I haven't done enough. I might be ashamed of that, for not doing enough. For not giving enough. For not being more perceptive. For not being aware enough. For not understanding

[Killer Mike]
Understand that a trap's just a trap
And when the government get you it's a wrap
I entered the facility a drug dealer
One month in a nigga tried me now I'm a killer
Nigga tried a nigga manhood
So I load a pillow case up with some canned goods
Couple locks, couple D-batteries
Beat that motherfucker way past assault and battery
(Savagely) Beat his ass to a casualty
Sent that prison punk to his mom's in a casket, G
Now the prison chaplain want to chaplain me
Told me confess sins it'll be alright
I told him fuck him, the warden and his white Christ
Called him a faggot, said he ain't living right
What kind of re-ligion don't allow man a wife?
You a boy lover father, that ain't right

[Charles Manson talking]
The street is my world. I don't pretend to go uptown and be anything fancy

[Killer Mike]
Unh-unh
Outlawed by birth
And I'm an outlaw every day until they put me in the dirt
My skin is my sin, every day I'm called nigger by a couple white men
(NIGGER!)
COs: undercover Aryans
Beat blacks to a pulp like a Barbarian
I told that Nazi "Don't hit me!"
He  did it anyway so I shanked him in his kidney

[Charles Manson]
You people have done everything in the world to me
Doesn't that give me equal right?
I could do anything I want to you people
Any time I want to
Because that's what you've done to me!
If you spit in my face,  slap me in my mouth
Throw me in solitary confinement for nothing
What do you think I'm going to do when I get out of here?

[Killer Mike]
I carved that guard, more years I'm facin'
Now the inmates call a young nigga Satan
Something like Malcolm before he joined the Nation
Back and forth in solitary, I'm pacin'
Five in the morning, I hear the Muslims praying
Six in the morning, the guards congregating
Seven in the morning, they beat me, bones breaking
Left me in the middle of the cell, cold, shaking
Left me in the hole, near death for a week straight
When they came back I knocked the piss and shit in their face
Cause I rebelled, they Guantanamo Bay'd me
Beat me till I cried like a motherfucking baby
Insane membrane, prison got me crazy
Sent me a nurse and I spit at the lady
Shit, this place made me devilish
My homies don't visit, plus my girlfriend  suckin' dick
The pain is too much to take
Like the boys that kill themselves after they're raped
Called her a cheap bitch when she visit me here
Because of that I ain't seen my kids in a year (I'm sorry)
The damn pain's unbearable
Got a motherfucker wildin' out like an animal
Gladiator school for the sadists
With the killers and the rapists is where I graduated

[Charles Manson talking]
The latrine is my world. I don't pretend to go uptown and be anything fancy.  I can, but I find more real in the world that I'm in,  than I do the tinsel, and the real world is the one I have to deal with everyday.  Believe me, if I started murdering people... there'd be none of you left

[Killer Mike]
Brutalized, institutionalized, in the belly of the beast in an inmates' eyes (2x)
Ask the public do you know what you're creating when you send the boys to the belly of Satan?
Ask the judges do you know what you're creating when you send the boys to the belly of Satan?
The politicians do you know what you're creating when you send the boys to the belly of Satan?[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around
Ain't shit sweet bout the peach -- this Atlanta, clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta -- up your jewelry, motherfucker!
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain
We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch
These real-ass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta they ain't never speak upon
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun

[Hook: Trouble]
And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Once upon a time in the projects
An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch, said, "This where little dogs sit"
Pointed at the yard, said, "That's where big dogs shit"
He said, "Don't leave til your ass get growed
And don't come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet, like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen"
Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care
Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
'96 I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this
A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies, searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv
Shoot a nigga, let him bleed -- fuck him, shorty
Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it
Quick to run up on that Audi, make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it
What's a coward to a kamikaze?
He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey; the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang
Listen to my Kimber .45 go bang
Bang bang, Grindtime, rap game
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames
Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains
All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
Well, who he talking to? All of y'all stars
All of y'all rappers and producers and such
No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us
I know some dumb country niggas, but them niggas ain't me
Know they dress and look the part, but them niggas ain't G
I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on T.V

[Hook][Hook]
I make big money, buy big cars, everybody know me (everybody know me)
I make big money, buy big cars, everybody know me (everybody know me)
I make big money, buy big cars, everybody know me (everybody know me)
I make big money, buy big cars, everybody know me (like I'm a movie star)

[Verse 1 - Killer Mike]
Talking money, getting Mike in new pair of Nikes
They said life was a bitch so I made her my wife
I'm talking holy matrimony 'til some other fucking money
Them other boys is talking but I swear to God they phony
Fuckboys crazy, nothing but [???]
That's why my motto to this day is still 'Fuck you, pay me'
Any rap nigga acting like he want it with me
I swear to God I'll put his rapping-ass next to Biggie
I swear to God I'll put his rapping-ass next to Pac
Martin Luther King, nigga, certified by the block
Gold 54 riding all chrome, big block
And the paint so wet I'm in need of a mop
Black and yellow Chevy and it's looking like a bumblebee
My partner came through in his Gellardo trying to humble me
I left, came back, Murciélago straight stunting G
When he seen me bending left, nigga must have shit hisself

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Messy Marv]
Gucci shirt, Gucci jeans, Gucci this, Gucci that
Before I walk out the house, everything gotta match
I ride through this bitch with a pocket full of money
I bet no nigga won't say nothing in front me
I went and bought a Benz and went and got a bike
Went and stopped by the paint shop then sprayed 'em cold white
Them 24-inches man, you know what it is
A nigga put 'em on so my shit'll look big
I'm a certified goon, I be putting in work
I ride with the cannon cause I be doing hella dirt
I'm the all black fitted with them all-black swatches
Pushing through the ghetto running from the paparazzi
All the hood niggas love me
The price on the coke, nigga, it look so lovely
I'm a thug 'til I die
The club ain't poppin' if these bitches ain't high
You know me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
Trina, Lil Kim, Mariah
Rihanna even Mýa
Got reps like singing cheques
A whip for each desire
They told me never to burn a bridge but I still keep a lighter
Ain't met a former friend that proved he can compete with fire
And the paint so wet I gotta park my cars inside a dam
So fly my clothing line should be called the 'Mileage Plan'
Metal inside my hand promise it ain't no trying fam
That Marvel comic baby
(What you mean?)
That Iron Man
That Maserati body parked right there outside the lobby
P-O-P to your body if you ever trying to try me
And the paint soaked c-c-candy ladies wanna lick my like a lolli-
P-O-P so my hobby is to sit behind a Jolly-
Rancher, look at my swagger, my name is more than known
My garage the square footage of the Georgia Dome
Got imported stones, always order chrome
Every other week my ride is gonna be exactly what I want it on

[Hook]
