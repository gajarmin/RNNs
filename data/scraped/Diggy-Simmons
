[Hook: Diggy Simmons]
Ain't bout to do
I'ma do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
I'ma do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
Let me do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
What he won't do

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
What he ain't gotta do
Is put a bow on a pink 911
And it ain't got a roof
Throw you the keys and you're telling all your girls
Girl ain't he the truth, yeah
That's why you need to go ahead, toss the metal
Toss them up the deuce (Gonna toss em up the deuce)
Gonna toss em up the deuce (Deuce, deuce, deuce)
And what I ain't tryina do
Is tell you're messing with a lame nigga
Guess we ain't the same kind of do
Pick a spot on the map
Tell the pilot longitude, latitude
Guess she give a nigga lip but she never gimme no attitude
She don't gimme no attitude

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Montana!
Ain't not true drop the half of mil on the car
Drop the top came out the roof
Waiting in the booth, LeBron in the V
We going back to he
She ain't bout to do
Shut Diggy I never win no figgy
I might pull up with Iggy, I might pull up with Nicki, ha
I said trick you guessing, courtside, got your chick four core pressin'
I think I met her at Griffin
Hope I ain't never gotta clip her like Griffin
He ain't spending on, the rarry on your arm
Bonita apple bomb, you gotta put me on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Diggy Simmons]
What he ain't bout to do
What he ain't gonna do
Is treat you how you wanna
And what I ain't bout to do
Nah, darling you, say that I'ma do it, I'm gonna
Let me change up your do
Change your winter into summer
Where you wanna go we can go, no, no, no
Girl we can go, nah
Come and see with the other side looks like
Buy you thangs that your other guy couldn't buy
If he only knew I bet he wouldn't like
Send that nigga text tell him goodnight
Young and independent
Show you thangs and I'm younger than your nigga
Yeah this could be for you
Do all the things that he ain't bout to do

[Hook][Hook: Jeremih]
Oh hey, there she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie, right? Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you
How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie, right? Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

[Verse 1]
It seems like for a while I’ve know ya
Nostalgic moments, feels like magic don't it?
Girl you killin' 'em, my condolence
That's how you on it? Yeeaaah, that’s how you on it
And I'm gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake, when no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush, love your dimples when you blush
It's the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
What's yo sign? I'm an Aries, I'm a 90's baby, clearly
I'll make sure to make time for you though my schedule may vary
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I just wanna know ya
I heard 'em say that beauty's in the eyes of the beholder
Well girl my vision’s bad so I'm gon' need you to come closer
Closer, now you right here where you 'pose to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Excuse me Misses, may I spark your interest?
Cause you sure got my attention, I just wanna grant you wishes (Lala)
What you want you get it, I don't call it tricking
Not just cause I got it cause I want to, that makes all the difference
I'm about my business, and ooh girl you the business
We should get together soon so we can do some business
I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya
Is you ready, what's the hold up?
You ain't 'bout no drama, you remind me of my mama
Smelling like flower balm and escada, shut it down and you won't even try ta
You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady
The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I know what they say
Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye
Don't believe it girl, I promise I'mma treat you like my treasure
I'm a movement by myself but I know you'll make me better

[Hook][Asher Roth]
My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis
Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad
The neural path I’ve traveled has immediate reaction
Can’t you see that I am beaming? I’ll be leaving in a second
Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions
At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house’s zenith
Yes, the fence intimidates, it’s meant to keep you out
But let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound
Cause freedom isn’t found inside a visa or a crown
And even the voice of reason couldn’t speak it out loud
But mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic
As he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow

[Charles Hamilton]
Rey Mysterio flow, staying clear
Of makeup-smeared hating queers, making clear this is spiritual
Throw a spear at you all, church final
Your funeral in an arena, you searching for fire
Or titles, or tidal waves
Tie the game like a shot from outside when it’s 95 to 98
The throw slid into you left-side broke (niggas) (beam)
Boa constrictor, choking (niggas), the grown man (beam)
Pause mean your controllers get broken (niggas) (beam)
Anarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (niggas) (Beam)
Love, I get none, like saying no to niggas
Hamiltonian’s loneliness, so I hold my (beams) (niggas)
I logged on to see a c-section, a gross display
Sleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons won’t go away
I keep pressing like my phone is afraid
To be a star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say

[Lupe Fiasco]
Calling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together
Fire like the fire flower, flier than the super feather
Superman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap
You can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme
You can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris
Foolishness, Lu been doing this since super letters
So I can’t spell and can’t mail it out
If you can’t feel, it’s too full, you can’t peel it out
Showboating at the show, but you can’t sell it out
I’m on the sea shepherd deck, helping the whales out
All my egos in the mirror, checking themselves out
Tweeters in the trunk, helping the twelves out
The speakers on bump, the rappers on acne
This track is what would happen if the rastas meet the mathletes
Yes sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes

[Chuck Inglish]
Big up to what’s been up, nigga
Pin-ups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures, good
And the kids connected up, and they clicked snap
Hollering, “Yeah, we weighed it on the iPhone scale app!”
Without fail, the best to ever do it just will
Haven’t done it all, but we got copied real well, though
But it ain’t no sweat, I got a whole outfit
And a new fitted cap that I ain’t wore out yet
(Check, check, check) And I’m beamin’
Yeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith
Projected widescreen, now they got it 3D
Now we NBA’d up from development leagues

[Mikey Rocks]
Ay, yo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell
Man, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail
Bubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window
Of whatever ‘Lac truck pick her up, retail
Nigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby
Grab my coattails and get a grip (grab ‘em)
You want the truth? Well, the truth is
This is it, pointing out the differences
This is exquisite shit, riveting, isn’t it?
Lizard king loafers on swole when I’m kicking it
Joe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole
You a handshake away, and them fingers is cold

[Blu]
Touch art, lush heart, brush my niggas’ shoulder off
Now that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me y’all’s
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all
Roger that, scholars back, solid black, go God
Gobble gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw
Pompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on
So gone, strode strong through your lawn ’til the dawn
Tell your mom, name another real as John, kill a song
‘Cause when you feel it, and it make yo’ ass chill and calm
Paying more than just attention for that glass I’m sipping on
Dog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad
Kidding, ma? Scratch backs, bringing out them kitten paws
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen’s warm
Back to attending business, do not lay them digits wrong
Dipping all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John
This is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period

[Diggy Simmons]
I know what you’re thinking, thinking I do not belong
Tell me Diggy ain’t beamin’, course I should be on this song
Yeah, I’m a child of God, my reflection is on
Yeah, I’m only 15, but my sixteens is strong
Didn’t want me to shine, now we sharing the stage
Twice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age
So the question remains, and it ain’t even how
Got that Verizon flow, are you hearing me now?
Word to Wasalu, they was saying my future was dark
I had the fame, but my name was missing the art
So I’m drawing the line, and I’m crossing my Ts
And I’m dotting my I’s, barely catching my Z’s
But I’ll be good by the morning, on my global grind like JoJo
They be looking at what I’m putting on and, so fly, so fresh at the Soho
Most niggas don’t know though, they can catch me on the first flight
Been working on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe
But I did it for the love, no check, mate

[Dosage]
When people said I couldn’t, I wouldn’t, I made them believers
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers
From the City of Brotherly Love, they saying we need you
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil
Some of them hate it, but I made it, so I’m never concerned
About what they be talking about, I’ve lived and I’ve learned
With my dream and my drive, I determined my turn
In this business, because I’m in control, meeting adjourned
I said, “It’s Third Degree, y’all heard of we?
I’m Dosage, have you heard of me?”
I come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be
Where people say it doesn’t matter to be much
I was on the Steppin' Lasers tour, and man, I shook it up
That was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up
If you against me, come correct, I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom)
Right before your eyes, forget about the dividends
I just want to say I remember when

[B.o.B]
Well, it’s B to the O, O to the B
You know it’s the flow, you know that it’s me, I flow to this beat
As easy as going to the store and holding receipts
And folding them neat, I’m focused as focused can be
You know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace
Or things could get heated and you’ll get ferociously beat
Speaking of ferociously beat, you know that girl ‘Nique?
You know she’s a freak, but anyway, back to what I’m supposed to be
Saying all over this beat, you know that we G’s
You see all the crowns, you know that we kings, you notice the rings
Everywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah
And you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam
It’s the All City varsity, hard-headed squad
We played y’all spades, y’all handle y’all cards
But we ain’t all odds, we just blaze, man
Y’all playing checkers in this game, this is chess, y’all pawns[Intro:]
Where is Mrs. Right?
I gotta find her

[Diggy]
Streamline and Conjunction

[Hook]
Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight, I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Travel to L.A., maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town, yo she might be out the states
Book a flight to London, ook a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?

[Verse 1]
Shawty say ya don’t but I betcha do
MB on your ringtone, posters in your room
Sassy lil' thang, li-like the way ya talk
Heard ya got the goods gon head show 'em off
Take a picture quick, send it to my phone
Dimple in your cheek, white gucci stunnas on
Don’t know where you’ve been hidin from me so long
Prodigy, Roc, Ray Ray, and Princeton we on
So baby come on

[Hook]

[Diggy Call Out]
Light skinned-ed, or da-dark skinned-ed
Long hair, don’t care, long as your heart's in it
Looking for my Mrs
Enough to drive me insane
Matter fact, ayo Prodigy sang

[Verse 2]
Hoppin on a plane, comin straight to y'all
In Tokyo we say Konichiwa, it's off the wall
London in the spring, Pa-Paris in the fall
We don't discriminate, girls know we love ‘em all
All my German chicks, let me kiss ya back
Open up your MacBook, put me on your lap
Stay sendin me smiley faces on the chat
Met some good girls, yeah they all over the map
But where she at, where she at

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Flying (so high, so high)
Destination everywhere
Gotta find a way to get to where
You are, you are

[Verse 3: Diggy]
Where's my Mrs. Right now
I need her right now
I got some things I want to say
So I’m gonna write it down
Wipe me down, wipe me down
If I like you, you wifey now
I predict one day we’ll be together
I’m a psychic (aowww)
Been to the south, been to the Bay
Even took a few trips outta States
I know you an angel
So maybe I should look outer space
D-I-Double G-Y's lookin for the right the one
Prodigy, Double R, Princeton, Ray Ray
Let ‘em know where we comin from

[Hook][Intro: Yo Gotti]
Yo
Hey, you
Fihhhh!
I can't relate to him, shawty
Hey!

[Pre-Hook: Diggy (2x)]
Say, girl, whatcha say?
I been getting the money, eh
Private jet [?]
Scrub nigga I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate (can't do it)

[Hook: Diggy (2x)]
He can't relate
He just can't relate
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate

[Verse 1: Diggy]
I ain't nothing but a real one
You already know what it is
Baby, I been gettin' to the money so a nigga what
Put you on the spot with a view, baby, you know we can live
And every time I drop it's a two, baby, you know we be fly up in it

[Bridge: Diggy]
Cause you so far from regular
Expensive, exquisite even
You deserve vacations every weekend
You deserve time in a Rolex incognito
You so far from regular
Beauty without a reason
Now you need a beast, I'ma go hard for ya
All up in the sheets, I'ma go hard for ya

[Pre-Hook: Diggy] + [Hook: Diggy (2x)]

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I don't run to the money
The money be running to me
The lil' nigga you with
That nigga mean nothing to me
But you, you really mean something to me
I can put you on [?], you something to see
But me, I'd rather take you to the hood
So you get honest at me (I am)
You got it, the money don't mean shit
I met you in my dreams shit
See a nigga on some him shit
And I'm on some team shit
Big wings shit, with-a-long-white-dress-if-you-do-the-right-thing shit
You a million dollar bitch, that's a hundred dollar nigga
Shawty ain't never seen shit

[Pre-Hook: Diggy] + [Hook: Diggy (2x)]

[Verse 2: Diggy]
Yeah, let them chat 'bout
Now let them get the money in the trap house
Living everything I rap 'bout
You want an Alexander Wang or a Gat blouse, pick
I ain't sharin', baby, ask out
Can't mention my
Go check your mailbox I sent you some things
But feel there's a need to explain, bang
You ain't never gotta sit in coach
In the winter I come find you when you ever need a coat
Ever see my kick it with them other niggas, no
And them other niggas know
I can't relate to them regular ass
Don't even pump regular gas
They can't relate
He can't relate
He can't relate

[Pre-Hook: Diggy] + [Hook: Diggy (2x)[Verse 1]
It can get stressful this life entertaining
Sometimes i'm be going through things can't explain it
You gave me a picture of you and i framed it
All my niggas be playing they claim it
Let me go vent
You need to feel this straight out the chest
I'll be on tour buses dealing with mess
Sometimes i feel like i'm less than my best
But you make me better
Yes.. honestly the road can get cold
Sometimes i need something i could hold
What i'm really tryna say is

[Hook]
Sometimes i need you, honestly
I ain't talking 24/7
Just when a nigga start itchin'
And only when i want to feel better
I need you, honestly
Sometimes i need you
And i can't lie honestly, i need you

[Verse 2]
Don't need all your times
Just the times that i need it
Do you a favour, do me now we even
Your girlfriends be saying i'm doing it wrong
But they come to see me perform
Wait for it... so addicted to your love
Know you feel the same
You left traces of your love on the pillow case
Don't be going through my phone
You respect the game
Trying to live life without you
Girl i swear it's lame

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I need to match what i needed
Match what i already am that's a hunnit
Ain't looking for trouble i'm on another level
Keeps with your boy if you coming
I need a girl that be running
Running her own life cause she own it
Can't tell her nothing she grown up
She got a good job, graduated last summer
She don't need me, she want it
Got her own money
No handout she adds to the tab
I know why y'all niggas mad
She tells when y'all tryna holla
We sit back and laugh bout it
She crazy that's why i love her that's my baby
We ain't gotta do nothing
We can chill around the house
And still feels amaze

You know they gon’ say
What Diggy know bout '88?
Well I know this much
They made a lotta money back then
And that’s what mine lookin’ like

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Aye lil' nigga, it’s Diggy, got the key to the city
Check my family tree, you know uncle taught Diddy
Who turned around and taught Biggie and Biggie taught Jigga
So you can just imagine what he teaching me, nigga
My top down in the winter, my doors up in the summer
I pulled up to the light and I drove off with her number
88 is the number, like Michael Irvin but younger
Ain’t no preserving my hunger, no, they like, "Where did he come from?"
Well I got 2 years in and a couple of months
Yeah, the road was Bobby Brown, it had a couple of bumps
They be showing me love, minus a couple of chumps
In my best Chris Tucker voice, “Is this watchu want?!”

[Hook]
No need to front, homie pardon my back
I’m gettin it crazy, how retarded is that?
I’m playin’ my cards, got a fistful of ace’s
And these lil faces I’m spending, you prolly could trace it
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)

[Verse 2: Diggy]
I hear the hate, I don’t sweat it cause I’m getting that fetti’ (I said it)
I see a lot of mad rappers, Derric "D-Dot" Angelettie
Compliments to the chef, ya boy out here eatin great
Homie, you ain't no umpire, why you watchin my plate?
While you watchin my pockets, Jordan 3′s in my closet
I get it all sent to me so I don’t need to go to shopping
I ain’t braggin, I’m swagging, my fly ladies whats happening?
Shout to Nicki I’m an Aries and we go good with Sag’s
... Mm-hm
Hope that made you smirk, I’m a flirt like Kirk
With Dirty Money God made dirt and (uh) dirt don’t hurt
This for my niggas that’s getting it every month on the first

[Hook]
No need to front, homie pardon my back
I’m gettin it crazy, how retarded is that?
I’m playin’ my cards, got a fistful of ace’s
And these lil faces I’m spending, you prolly could trace it
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, that’s what my family was rockin’, I just sat back and watched em
I was only 13 so I ain’t know nothin bout coppin’
I just knew that they had it and if I asked then I got it
It all started from trees then it turned to narcotics
All the whips was exotic, all the chicks was erotic
Money was coming so fast, all you needed was product
And somebody to test it, find a good place to try it
Never keep nothin’ on you, find a good place to hide it
If I’m in it I own it cause if I like it I buy it
Keep the loud in the air, connect like that I’m quiet
How’d you hop in this platinum and you ain’t even near gold?
Cause I’m still spendin’ money that’s 24 years old!

[Outro]
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88!)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88!)[Hook: Diggy Simmons]
Ain't bout to do
I'ma do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
I'ma do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
Let me do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
What he won't do

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
What he ain't gotta do
Is put a bow on a pink 911
And it ain't got a roof
Throw you the keys and you're telling all your girls
Girl ain't he the truth, yeah
That's why you need to go ahead, toss the metal
Toss them up the deuce (Gonna toss em up the deuce)
Gonna toss em up the deuce (Deuce, deuce, deuce)
And what I ain't tryina do
Is tell you're messing with a lame nigga
Guess we ain't the same kind of do
Pick a spot on the map
Tell the pilot longitude, latitude
Guess she give a nigga lip but she never gimme no attitude
She don't gimme no attitude

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Montana!
Ain't not true drop the half of mil on the car
Drop the top came out the roof
Waiting in the booth, LeBron in the V
We going back to he
She ain't bout to do
Shut Diggy I never win no figgy
I might pull up with Iggy, I might pull up with Nicki, ha
I said trick you guessing, courtside, got your chick four core pressin'
I think I met her at Griffin
Hope I ain't never gotta clip her like Griffin
He ain't spending on, the rarry on your arm
Bonita apple bomb, you gotta put me on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Diggy Simmons]
What he ain't bout to do
What he ain't gonna do
Is treat you how you wanna
And what I ain't bout to do
Nah, darling you, say that I'ma do it, I'm gonna
Let me change up your do
Change your winter into summer
Where you wanna go we can go, no, no, no
Girl we can go, nah
Come and see with the other side looks like

If he only knew I bet he wouldn't like
Send that nigga text tell him goodnight
Young and independent
Show you thangs and I'm younger than your nigga
Yeah this could be for you
Do all the things that he ain't bout to do

[Hook][Intro]
As I take this journey I recognize my potential for success is just as great as my potential for failure
Fully aware of my current strengths and future weaknesses, experienced by those who came before me
The greats of my past have walked this way, left blueprints and they've lost themselves relapsed in recovery
I realize I am not the only young explorer however I am in no race the journey is all of ours, but I can not lie I desire the victory of achievement to be mine, humbled however fearless I am exposed to the criticism of onlookers, but my faith and direction come from above
I am airborne

[Verse 1: Diggy]
With doctors all around me, I live aimed through the atmosphere
Notions and adapts around me, but not impact no fear
Ya' want the celebrations, I want the constellations
Aline in all of my favor shinin' through all the nation
So when you kids wake up, I'm the brightest thing that you see
Cause I got my mind made up, and it ain't no sweet sixteen
Unless I write some down trend set and transmission
And as they float around, ya' get the first addition
Some said im spaced out, oh well I guess they right
Cause I got whole nother outlook I told ya on my first flight
Im just a youngin thats on a mission for the world to listen
An premonition a wonderful fathers had in vision
Im a rappers delight, these are the brakes
So heres the message, im on my way
Im a rare form, in rare form, young diggy im airborne

[Hook: Wynter Gordon]
I'm going airborne im taking me higher
I got the light now, and im on fire
Im on my way, (my way), (my way)
Im on my way, (my way), (my way) 2x[Intro: Shianne Phillips]
Take me as I am
Or you can have nothing
Nothing at all

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Uh, yeah
Never understood why discrimination existed amongst us people
When all of us wanna be taken equal
Not for the colour of our skin, or the fact that we fit in
Criteria should be on what's within
The heart, mind and soul and where we tryna go
Cuase of we caught in the past, how we gonna reach our goals
People be so concerned about the cons instead of the pros
That preconcieved notions be blocking out on my flows
They be acting like they know they be real quick to throw it out
To turn about a kid of the numbers in his bank account
I'd appreciate it if you listen then open your mouth
Feel alot better if you knew wht you was talking bout
Just a youngin grindin feelin inside
That he hasnt got hes point accross after numerous times yeah
Tellin people hes a normal kid
Following dreams and hopes of one day to makin it big

[Hook: Shianne Phillips]
So why dont you take me as I am
Or you can have nothing, nothing at all
So take me as I am
Or have nothing at all

[Verse 2: Diggy]
Just looking around at all the people that surround
None of them was with me though, months ago but tellin me
The way that I should go about it the things that I should put out
When its expression to me you can tell me how
The ways the ropes of being a D I double G G Y
The little nigga, thats gonna be fly
But alot of the time hes just gotta swallow hes pride
Despite of all the people thats making him feel depride
Other feels shocked just because of where he came from
Labelling what i've done, when you ain't even here taste of
None of still on me, I dont even care say some
I done heard it all so your two cents won't hurt none
And I know that I'mma keep going wit it
And I know the ridicule im rolling with it
Just aslong im taking for who am
And where im going cause thats most important to my fam

[Hook: Shianne Phillips]
So why dont you take me as I am
Or you can have nothing, nothing at all
So take me as I am
Or have nothing at all[Hook]
I won't look back
I'll take my chance in the world
Out in the big bad world
I'll fall but I'll never burn
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Are you alone in the big bad world?
Alone in the big bad world

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Made a vow to the game
That I'll never get caught up
In this thing called fame Not what the world shows us
Just to hold out, to get torn up
And forget about the way you was brought up
From the floor up, put you together to get in like coke
Cause then you get spit out the mouth like reflux
And you want re-duct
Man, this game is thicker than Niptuck
But you can't let it kill ya
Why don't you look at the side that's realer
Not the fast life, not the parties
The reason why ya here, your career
Little thing that made you V.I.P
The reason why they never need to see ID
The reason why the bottles on the house every week
Save me a friend but when a day's bleak
Not sittin' right by ya side
They just got one thing in mind
Never yo best interest
Just best send you up out every night
What's this, talking to life
Cause this one's got you close
To the edge it's li-like a drug
You better learn not to overdose
Speedin' in the fast life, pullin' out the champagne
Livin' every night like you don't give a damn thing
Look at you now and how things did change
Lying within you is pain
Never got hell something you wanted
Could make you feel so ashamed
In this world you just gotta say

[Hook]
I won't look back
I'll take my chance in the world
Out in the big bad world
I'll fall but I'll never burn
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Are you alone in the big bad world?
Alone in the big bad world

[Verse 2: Diggy]
Yeah, yeah, we all living in a big bad world
Boy meets girl, everything is breezy
Used to pick her up, beep beep
Put her in the backseat
Stop in the lot, then skeet skeet
He was a thug, she was a love
That's how she thought it should be, be
He was sellin' em drugs, bustin' em slugs
She's running all around in the street, street
Let's fast forward, nine months over here
Come a baby around in a stroller
"That's not mine" is what he told her
Now her world just got much colder
He said it was through
Then what she gon' do?
Mom's kicked her out and the baby too
She gotta hustle for money
To put food in the tummy
Shake her booty for dummies
In that room that they come in
But there ain't no one by her side
To let her know it's all right
She don't have much, but she tries
To stop her baby from cryin'
She's a lady of deny
You can lay with per bribes
She would've made a beautiful wife
But now she can't because she's
Growing in the fast line
You's pouring champagne
Giving up her body like she don't give a damn thing
Look at you now and how things did changed
Lying would do you some change
She forgot that she is a woman
How she's degraded is a shame
In this world you just gotta say

[Hook]
I won't look back
I'll take my chance in the world
Out in the big bad world
I'll fall but I'll never burn
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Are you alone in the big bad world?
Alone in the big bad world

[Bridge]
They say you should have whatever you like
But does that mean that you get what you need?
Maybe the world could be yours in time
But does happiness grow on trees?
Does happiness grow on trees?
Does happiness grow on..

[Hook]
I won't look back
I'll take my chance in the world
Out in the big bad world
I'll fall but I'll never burn
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Are you alone in the big bad world?
Alone in the big bad world[Verse 1: Jacob Latimore]
I had to approach ya, you were sucha talent
Tennis ah like Serena sit up like a stallion
Girl you deserve the finest designers in fashion

Just to make it happen
Flyin' around it that rocket
You can call me NASA
Co-pilot of my rocket I'll make sure that I strap up

[Bridge]
Compliment my aura; I love you're decora

[Hook]
Girl you know we bout to blast off, blast off

[Verse 2: Jacob Latimore]
Girl you should let me coach ya
You'd be guaranteed to win

Their swagger need to hit the gym
Once I get hands on ya, you can go no where but up
It's so good it's necessary so just let me show ya baby
I'm fly and they're not me, them niggas are the actors
Confident im not cock.... girl you're the one I'm after

[Bridge]
Compliment my aura; I love you're decora
Ride around in that Bentley Azure.... ohhhhhhh
Come back to my launch back girl if you ain't been up before

Baby I'mma have you seeing stars

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Diggy]
They call me young god
She treat me like one too
Yeahhhh, hmmmm
No need to tell she already know
Don't miss your chance to make this rocket blow
But I don't wanna blast off in it
Who you kiddin', young and gettin' it
So she want a little Simmons (ha)
Shake it like you nervous I work hard so I deserve it
And you don’t get this often so don’t front when we in person
I'm kinda thinking you worth it
So make your way to this room
I'll bet you'll be coming soon
I'll take you over the..... Moon

[Bridge]

[Hook][Verse 1]
Stay fresh, you can smell it on me
Peep the way I dress, you ain’t got this homie
Van Assche’s up on my feet
Some monster beats and they made by me
I’m all about it
Can’t talk about it
Tell C. Lotti go and get that feat
They awe struck when they see me
Got 'em going crazy like Stevie
Not Joselline
But got lots of them
And I stay with a couple of Ri Ris
And I ain’t talking retarted
But yeah that body retarted
Said she knows I’m 17
And she can’t wait 'til I get started
And that ain’t even what I’m tripping off
4th tour that I’m kicking off
Need rest after this jet lag and
These fresh tags that I’m ripping off
I rip 'em off!
I rip 'em off!
Cats out here with alotta fear
They looking hard, but they spitting soft
Shout out to the homies showing us love in the D
Had the line around the corner in the hood at Shantinique
You see Diggy out in Philly, so shout out my homie Meek
Had him come out out my show before he signed to MMG
See, I’ll tell you what you wanna know
I just seen the homie, Cole
He say he ain’t doing nothing to her
Hey, I let it go
You know that I’m smart enough not to get all swallowed up
By the crazy gossipers tryna make it popular
No amateur. See, You ain’t gonna catch me slipping on that camera:
Cheese,Ain’t feeling none of these young boys, I’m no Sandusky
Slow flow for my stamina, breathe
Y’all keep talking ’bout my first week
I don't know why y’all bother
Sold out every show this year, cheapest seat 10 dollars
Now, times that by 3 thou
Times that by like 18
And I ain’t even 18, so what you look like hating me?
I’m made to be majorly and creatively able
Because the greatest enabled me when he came out in ’83
And so basically, haters be mostly made up of fakery
Not as mad as they say they be
When they see me, they're neighborly

[Hook]
Like stop!
We ain’t caring when you pop
We ain’t caring when you drop
We ain’t grinning, we just grinding
Steady winning. Better let that just burn
Let that just burn
Let that just burn
Let that just burn
Yeah, I’m out here getting money, homie
I ain’t even 20, and I don’t owe my soul in return
Better let that just burn

[Outro: Perry}
Yeah, let that shit burn!
Don’t know what the fuck y’all thought!

So you get honest at me (I am)
You got it, the money don't mean shit
I met you in my dreams shit
See a nigga on some him shit

[Pre-Hook: Diggy] + [Hook: Diggy (2x)]

[Verse 2: Diggy]

You want an Alexander Wang or a Gat blouse, pick

Go check your mailbox I sent you some things
But feel there's a need to explain, bang
You ain't never gotta sit in coach
In the winter I come find you when you ever need a coat
Ever see my kick it with them other niggas, no
And them other niggas know
I can't relate to them regular ass
Don't even pump regular gas
They can't relate
He can't relate

[Pre-Hook: Diggy] + [Hook: Diggy (2x)[Verse 1]
Before we even start we gonna need a break

Tell me what you want, what you saw
On the day when you fell in love

[Hook]
When I'm in the buildin'

And I’m not pressing charges
Don’t want you to ricochet and hit another target
You take me to the edge, right up to the margin

All I see is fireworks I can feel it sparking
Hope you keep me at the center of your bullseye
And you know it’s more benefits or full time

Don't come any closer, you might step on my Cultures

Get up on the floor shake it shake like you're supposed to
If you know getting over tell them copy, copy, over

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Hook]Live from the Apple
Slicing the American pie
With dope lyrics
Watch me get America high
By your appearance I can get a glimpse of your vibe
They say you are what you wear, I am Yves Saint Laurant
Mixing Martin Margiella
Catch me at the Montreyon
Fella I’m getting money thats why you all jealous
This ain't a rap song, this is a rap psalm
Immaculate so I’ma be the first to cast on
In kindergarten I was filling out my tax form
While my other class mates was learning Jimmy Crack Corn
? how can I go broad, riding shot gun with Lupe through Chicago hood
Hat tilted to the side like a GD bumping a Pac Cd
Picture me rollin’ holla when you see me
This easy sorta like my ABC’s
And I’ll take another ? nigga 1,2,3
Know my name when I spell, it’s D-I two G’s
Rather die before I’m telling see I’m too G

Digg is like
Life or death
I’m a rebel
My poety’s deep I never fell
Digg is like
Half man half amazing
Digg is like
Life or death
I’m a rebel
My poety’s deep I never fell
Digg is like
Half man half amazing

It’s the return of the light skin
Okay alright then
The king on my name is sperated by a hyphen
Looking at my Breitling it’s about that time
Stunting like a Badboy out the Porsche just shine
Gotta rap like a peda stomp a rat in front of pedo
When its comes to cooking heaters I’m a baker like I need her
Can’t come up ? like a phone off the reciever
I know you’re all eager to see me compete with Bieber
Not knowing thats my homie, we chilling kicking our feet up
Don’t do business with a worker so direct me to your leader
In a few years I’ll be the chairman of ?, Warner, Elektra, Atlantic, re-up
And when I go watch the money go pre-nup
We going hard in the paint nigga D-up
Try to bring the heat and you’ll still lose if ya’ll team up
This is for my fly niggas jetsetters we are

[Hook][Hook: Jeremih]
Oh hey, there she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie, right? Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you
How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie, right? Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

[Verse 1]
It seems like for a while I’ve know ya
Nostalgic moments, feels like magic don't it?
Girl you killin' 'em, my condolence
That's how you on it? Yeeaaah, that’s how you on it
And I'm gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake, when no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush, love your dimples when you blush
It's the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
What's yo sign? I'm an Aries, I'm a 90's baby, clearly
I'll make sure to make time for you though my schedule may vary
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I just wanna know ya
I heard 'em say that beauty's in the eyes of the beholder
Well girl my vision’s bad so I'm gon' need you to come closer
Closer, now you right here where you 'pose to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Excuse me Misses, may I spark your interest?
Cause you sure got my attention, I just wanna grant you wishes (Lala)
What you want you get it, I don't call it tricking
Not just cause I got it cause I want to, that makes all the difference
I'm about my business, and ooh girl you the business
We should get together soon so we can do some business
I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya
Is you ready, what's the hold up?
You ain't 'bout no drama, you remind me of my mama
Smelling like flower balm and escada, shut it down and you won't even try ta
You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady
The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I know what they say
Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye
Don't believe it girl, I promise I'mma treat you like my treasure
I'm a movement by myself but I know you'll make me better

[Hook]"steppin out like who hotter than me, really?/ I inspire empires of the city/ now celebrate and tell the haters you busy/ as you step inside of this elevator with me/ its goin up, the microscope even bigger now/ and sure enough, they tryna break my spirit down/ I won't cry, dont reason with the losers/ and still I rise like Jesus on you Judas/ I'm talkin hip hop royalty/ importantly I'mma promise to give you all of me/ all the hardwork, pain, and the sacrifice/ so you can feel the presence even in the after-life/ big dreams, focus? im very/ feelin like im fifteen goin on thirty/ yall jus got the vision how, before yall was missin out/ food for thought, you can do the dishes now/ now simmer down/ quiet on the set, just staring in the clouds/ its gettin high, I see the sky more, goodnight yall, this is my floor/ my floor... goodnight yall, this is my floor"[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]

Eat em like they got ham on em

Give me a minute Imma mop up these rappers up like janitor
Didn't know? You know now
This is how it goes down
You a clown. I got more niggas than you do in your town
Take a chance. I did
A nigga put his hands on me
And that'll be the last thing he do
Atlantic, filling up my planner
Getting ready to have the whole world in a panic
Imma get it. New York City know I put it down
Tell Amare Stoudemire I said welcome to my house
Here we go. I'm fly when I'm fly
Don't matter what I wear when I'm on that G5
And I don't even try cuz it's in my design
And I know that deep down that you pray on my demise

You ain't rockin those
Red and guacamol
Gucci slippers when I'm chillin in Galapagos
Yeah I'm on a boat, somewhere in Pacific coast
Just updated my status
I ain't need no post
Acting hard, when you a male Ke$ha
Hot steppin in your Sketchers
You a square, L-7
Put the L up to your heaven
Raise your 11s to the heavens
Make a promise you won't be a lame in 2011, ha
I'm the real deal, you a make shift
Holiday, you only get busy on occasions
I'm a problem. You not in the equation
A little nigga hungry, got munchies but I ain't blazin
From stages to stages
20 thou for an hour that's a basic
I'm still on with the squad that I came with
The only Mohican left; the last of the greatest

Chorus[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
Send your little soldiers to my door
And watch them fall down
Fall down
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
If you wish to test me start a war
And watch them fall down
Fall down

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
I kill anything you send at me, got no time for frenimies
So either you respect me or neglect me, can't get rid of me
These fake, fake niggas they ain't who they pretend to be
These shake weight niggas out here ruining the industry
Either you a copy or a clone
You ratchet or you trapping or you tryna watch the throne
And I won't let they actions be distracting all my goals
Niggas I used to know acting like groupies in my phone, guess we on
We was home, now we made our dreams realer
And since they never pushed me, I don't know if I'm a killer
We can find out together, try to be a scene stealer
Man I'll bomb on you niggas in a minute, Reggie Miller
I ain't afraid to tango with rivals until they strangle
Cause ain't nothing ever shameful in victory if it's painful
And for the crown that dangles I'll battle at every angle
I run circles around your triangles
Wassup?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmmons]
Don't know how any grown rapper would consider me a subject
And I ain't even got my first Benz sitting on dubs yet
I guess I rattled you snaggletooth you know better
Thought J stood for Jermaine not Jet Setter
You see me and shook my hand copping pleas in person
Now you act less than a man mentioning me in verses
Man you used to have dreams of my big sister kissing ya
Now it's nightmares of a little brother dissing ya
Sneak disses and jabs I don't really see the benefit
But I guess you lame and I probably keep you relevant
Maybe you should sign with me instead of Mr. Carter
How you mad at me I got a relationship with my father, huh?
Guess I’m the second one to give this man a platform
But I won’t go as far as saying cats should clap for em
And if they did then this verse might as well be a hearse
Killed you, ain't even curse nigga

[Hook]

[Outro: Diggy Simmons]
Just a lil' nigga with talent!Can you see me glow in the dark
I'm one with the stars and never to far yeah

Anything worth living is worth dying
Anything worth getting is worth trying
I put myself in the shoes of a giant with double tube socks two knots and I tied it!
I was frightened I was tired
But I knew that one day I would try em'
Heard a million no's all it took was one yes
Now I'm flowin' like the wind underneath a sun dress
Aww YES!
I can smell the victory
They used to pick at me now they picking me
To be the one to hold the torch that liberty
I'd tell you every detail I see it that vividly
I tried to warn y'all since Airborne
I'm cold like I let the air on
I'm dope I'm dope heroin
And the world's gonna know from here on

~Chorus~
Can you see me glow in the dark?
I'm one with the stars and never to far yeah
I can see you closing your eyes
So don't be surprised
All it takes is a spark till I glow in the dark
I illuminate I shine
Nothing happened before this time
And this time, it's time, it's time (x2)

I never let em' tell me what I can't do
God won't give me anything I can't handle
One candle can light all the rest
I'll live forever like I got a bite on my neck
Through my music through my songs
This is your amusement this is my psalms
My God forgive them for idolatry
Diggy underscore Simmons do you follow me?
Do you dig me?
Do your history!
This didn't happen over night
Quite the contrary I've been working all my life
You hear what you hear I work hard to get it right!
They can measure light but can't measure darkness
I ain't earn my stripes? That's preposterous
First I couldn't grab em' now look at how I got em'
It started with a thought and y'all thought it couldn't happen

~Chorus~
Can you see me glow in the dark?
I'm one with the stars and never to far yeah
I can see you closing your eyes
So don't be surprised
All it takes is a spark till I glow in the dark
I illuminate I shine
Nothing happened before this time
And this time, it's time, it's time, it's time (x2)

Maurice Freehill once said "Who is more foolish? The child afraid of the dark or the man afraid of the light?"

Glow in the dark

Don't fret for everything around you is within you illuminate
Glow in the dark oooh oooh oooh ...aaah aaahh
Glow in the dark oooh oooh oooh ...aaah aaahh
Glow in the dark...

P.s if anyone can fill in the blanks for the unknown lines please leave a commentYeah, I'm ready, yeah

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
They want me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
With my back against the wall
Put my head to the sky
No, I won't let 'em break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I'm ready)

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
All the stares and all the glares
They waiting on him
And all the weight from all the hate
It's gaining on him
The intensity as it rises
Nobody can disguise it
It's like he got fire in his eyelids
The crowd is roaring, it's so enormous
His blood is boiling
His head is down and he's focused
He wishes they'd ignore him
Who in they right mind
Wants to let his light shine
He ain't even in his prime
Pressure of a lifetime
He standing steady, hands sweaty
May be nervous, but ready
The skepticism lies heavy
He's bout to make it petty
He got his fam on his back
Bout to carry like Chevy
So much on his plate
He hopes the repercussions ain't deadly
But he ain't gonna back down, for what?
He faces right now and he
Knows that he will out stand every
Doubter that's around
Misconceptions are knocked out
There will no longer be doubt
He hears them boo but he won't stop
Till his name is what they shout

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
He's no longer fearing
Now swerving past 'em and persevering
The way he's staring is clearing
All that could be competition
Immediate intuition is winning
He's never slipping
Been hearing them saying that
He could be the best that ever did it
Their expectations lie high
So he's just praying, "Can I
Be the best man I could ever be?
To exceed everything they want me to be
No anxiety, just gonna do me
And always proceed for the ones that believe
In the young man that's dedicated with a potential to achieve"
So I'mma keep going, keep flowing, keep knowing
I'm the dopest, my rhymes are potent
But I'mma need you to know it
I know where I came from but I stay so hungry and focused
Like I was focusing and wasn't nearly in one of the closest
Great expectations, I got 'em waiting, anticipating
They all debating on if he's hype or will he be staying
So now I'm saying, I'm reaching to be one of the greatest
So if you hate it take it cause I won't stop even when I make it

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Bridge: Bei Maejor]
Staring into heaven with my headphones on
You can see it in my eyes and know
That I'm the one they have been waiting for
I know my dreams are waiting for me
And looking down ain't the way to go, noooo
Follow your dreams
Follow your dreams
We got great expectations

[Outro: Diggy Simmons]
Not til' they screaming my name, yeah [x2]
I ain't gonna give up the game, yeah [x3]
Not til' they screaming my name, yeah [x2]
I ain't gonna give up the game [x3][Hook]
Hello world
I heard you've been looking for me
I heard you've been waiting on me
Well I'm here and I'm here to stay
Hello world
Sometimes your love turns to ugly
But this world it ain't gotta love me
Well it's cool cause i'll be okay

[Verse 1 - Diggy Simmons]
Uhh, I said hello world, meet the man of the century
The man of the hour, I'm usually late on my entry
I'm well worth the wait cause trust you won't wanna miss me
I'm not destined for greatness, you could never convince me
That I'm not from the bottom, I grew up so-so
When I rise to the top-top, I'mma tell you I told so
I'mma have the world sick like I'm a common cold
When 'Bron made the call, to tell the Cavs he's gone
Diggy's home and big it I'm married to two things
I said my vows to money, my other honeys the stage
There's nothing you can say cause I possess the power
They said to tone it down, so I'mma turn it up louder
There's no time to waste, no pit stops, this is a race
And I'm so far ahead of y'all that there's a delay
I'm trying to get me a ring, more than 5 in a row
And the song goes "Hello World"

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Diggy Simmons]
Conquer the world, that's my goal and I plan to
It's already been written, referenced the Book of Daniel
And you lose and they love you, when you win they can't stand you
Like they sit in a pool of lies, there's few that'll stand true
They think that i'll think no, cause i've got a afro
And I'm outta space gone, cause I got an astro-
-nomical, rap flow, out in commas to cash rolls
Wanna swim with the big fish, I'll piranha you tadpoles
They say that I'm cocky, but I reply that not me
See me rollin' on blades uh, but I don't play hockey
I don't play games much, cause I'm about paper
Recreational past-times, won't help me gain such
They were reluctant, til' I showed 'em substance
Now they caught in my whirlwind, cause I got 'em sucked in
Then I show 'em toughness, I show a lot of heart
Now they all on my side, I call it alucard

[Hook]
