[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Yeah, back up in the hood again, where it's all good again
Ridin candy slab, grippin on the wood again
Outta line niggas get back in place where you should've been
In case you don't understand, I'mma make it understood again
King of the underground, my gangsta will never fail
You 'bout to make me go postal for fuckin with my mail
You got the connect, but you ain't got the clientele
You the hoax and niggas know it, that shit ain't hard to tell
Rat bitch, recognize that your cheese ain't finna sell
I'm finna break some bread with the feds? You dumb as hell
I been around the block before, sold it all from rock to blow
And I don't fuck around, when the feds in town I got to go
Respect my mind cause I'm a trill old schooler
Summer time get too hot, I wait for winter when its cooler

Pull it out my pants and make errbody back up
Fuck a record deal, the boy just too real
Watch him cook it on the stove, man the boy got skills
Streets is talkin, whole hood's whisperin
Careful what I say cause I know them folks listenin

Take it out the wrap and I put it on the scale
But keep that on the low cause I ain't tryna go to jail

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
They call me Slick Manning cause my vision's great
Toss shells like pigskins when I squeeze the eight
Think I start for the Braves, way I rep the A
Like John Smoltz in his prime when I pitch the K
Got the scale in my pocket on a suicide grind
Yams in the strap facin suicide time
Outlandish wit it man, it's stupid how we shine
Catch me in them bunkers with them troops all the time
I eat like Saddam but I'm sick like Uday
Keeps some youngsters with me and they all bout gunplay
We been had the streets jammed up to stock
We down south niggas but the plugs up top

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 3: Blood Raw]
This for gangstas, I ain't talkin bout you busters
Chopper toters, money getters, naw not you suckers
Cooler than a fan, colder than a freezer
Still in the hood, ridin sixes on the Regal
Still on MLK, still got a side
Still get money and I'm still in the trap
Lil mamma say she like me plus she know I'm hood
I'm a fool with laying pipe, and she know I'm good
I got a spot for the yay, Uncle Pete keep the K's
Auntie Shirley got the money, if they rush then we straight
Eight Seven Thirty Two shawty, leave it in my pager
We ain't talkin on them phones cause I know you talkin paper

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
You recreate a shield you betta respect us
Betta understand the game, these checks, not checkers
Two chunked out chains we call dem double deckers
You comin for that saint nigga we bound to wreck ya
My niggas add flavor to the game like zeteran
Bitch my 25th tool I'm a concrete veteran
We eat wheat niggas up like corn on the cob
You a hustla, naw don't quit ya day job!

[Verse 3: Blood Raw]
Errbody claim reson errbody kno the game

But on the real shit

We to real ova here to fall out like Cash Money brothers
Naked boy smith
Ran for Evan Smith
Ross facin life and that's rich now that's Gangsta Shit!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Cali gon cali ridin tall in his saddle
Pullin up low and with that choppa I'm ready for battle
It's gangstas from San Francisco and up to Seattle
We ain't with all that snitchin shit so mane go and get tattle
I'm a dirty south legend and thou shall honor the team
From the land of the long hard
Where we home sellin D
Get that dirt weed local
Not the indo ship
Not to mention the gallons of Promethazine that we sip[Hook: Young Jeezy]
They need a hoodstar, been there sold all that
Plus he really played with them thangs whatcha call that?
Hoodstar, erryday on some hood shit
Pocket full of money yeah you know a nigga hood rich
Hoodstar, been there, counted all that
Tell that boy official by the way he wear his ball cap
Hoodstar, be in the spot with all his chains on
Crazy when this drop this that real nigga theme song

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Walk off with a mission in hand - save the day
And the real gon' follow ya nigga, pave the way
That's why these other niggas follow you Young, cause you the leader
OK, I'm 'bout to take 'em to school, guess who the teacher?
What the fuck man? Them numbers as high as a Delta flight
Why you think a nigga high erryday? That delta light
Yeah you know my life is outta control, hope I dont crash
Think my partner on 3 Exxon, I'm on that gas
Thinking erryday is 24/8, I'm 'bout that cash
Used to cop the 28 for the 8, don't make me laugh (hahaaaa)
Gimme every white brick in the world, that ain't enough
But I get in there and anybody that need 'em - This shit is rough
They need (a hero)

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
Hoodstar, you understand what I'm sayin'?
Check out my D-Boy sneaks, check out the way I play 'em (forreal!)
Unlaced Releskas, I count stacks all day
Hit the stash up then fibs tonight we goin' to play
And you know how the real do it, it's this club, that club
Open up justice, it's time for some late grub
Kickin' big shit, them hoes love that
We style breakfast, the lames try to handcuff the swag
And I'm just tryna put up some shots on that new Jag
You think I'm slippin', fuck around and catch the whole mag
We throw them clothes up on the counter fuck the pricetags (fuck em!)
White paint, white seats, call it the white flag

[Hook: Young Jeezy][Hook: Young Jeezy] (x2)
I keep it gangsta and they love that shit (hey) (x3)
If you's a gangsta you gon' love this shit

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
This one's for you and I ain't talkin Bud Light
HK nigga with that little red light
Whole club bouncin, errbody strapped up
Pull it out my pants and make errbody back up
Fuck a record deal, the boy just too real
Watch him cook it on the stove, man the boy got skills
Streets is talkin, whole hood's whisperin
Careful what I say cause I know them folks listenin
It's your boy Mr. Seventeen-Five
My lil mamma hold the strap and the work while I drive
Take it out the wrap and I put it on the scale
But keep that on the low cause I ain't tryna go to jail

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
They call me Slick Manning cause my vision's great
Toss shells like pigskins when I squeeze the eight
Think I start for the Braves, way I rep the A
Like John Smoltz in his prime when I pitch the K
Got the scale in my pocket on a suicide grind
Yams in the strap facin suicide time
Outlandish wit it man, it's stupid how we shine
Catch me in them bunkers with them troops all the time
I eat like Saddam but I'm sick like Uday
Keeps some youngsters with me and they all bout gunplay
We been had the streets jammed up to stock
We down south niggas but the plugs up top

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 3: Blood Raw]
This for gangstas, I ain't talkin bout you busters
Chopper toters, money getters, naw not you suckers
Cooler than a fan, colder than a freezer
Still in the hood, ridin sixes on the Regal
Still on MLK, still got a side
Still get money and I'm still in the trap
Lil mamma say she like me plus she know I'm hood
I'm a fool with laying pipe, and she know I'm good
I got a spot for the yay, Uncle Pete keep the K's
Auntie Shirley got the money, if they rush then we straight
Eight Seven Thirty Two shawty, leave it in my pager
We ain't talkin on them phones cause I know you talkin paper

[Hook] (x2)[Hook – Slick Pulla]
Me and my man do our thing with the splits
Now we coming down, matching feet, matching whips
Drop it in the [?] watch it come back to chips
Now we lockinb down the block, this like [?]
We don’t break shit, one week we gon get that
Bad bitches, double em up, we gon hit that
Pass a gram of sand, we gon spit that
That real D boy lingo, we gon kick that
Yeah, for real

[Verse 1 – Slick Pulla]
Fourway on my feet
The kid go hard for the money
You sweet ass niggas want the honey
Treat them things like the homies, yeah we keep em moving
A bass mouth in the coupe, I’m tryna get some chewing
If you ain’t cashing plugs out then what the fuck you doing
Like John Travolta when it come to a Olivia Newton
Snow put me up on game, showed me how to push it
Now I’m in Texas playing big like my name Cushing
Corner the market, massive distribution
Met a new sick chain, got them hoes puking
And the loafers clean, nice, suede
And the linen shirts perfect cause the boy’s paid
In full

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Jeezy]
Chain so big it look monkey
Addicted to this cash, I’m a motherfucking junkie
Niggas mad cause I passed, and they motherfucking flunkies
If it’s really like that fuck nigga, then slug me
Came invalidated, I didn’t need no validation
Pope to the streets, I’m the leader of a nation
I took my cane and my pain and my other mindframe
And I told em bout the game and accumulated fame
Told you back with Fab on do the damn thang
If the number on the right, I can move the damn thang
And the, coupe’s clean and the top’s suede
And the F&N working cause your boy’s paid
I’m full

Infront of ya daughter, ya son or his grandpa
Hommies in the street deep, lookin' like a Trump squad

Nah, it ain't a game dogg, it's real in the field (Aye!)
X amount of shells pop-a-nigga like a pill

Chromed hunned spokes on the mothafuckin' wheels
Trapstar, I got work in the area (In the area!)
United Streets D-Boyz of America (U-S-D-Ayy!)
Betcha life dat'll MossBerg'll a burry ya (Burry ya!)
They gone have to call a coroner to carry ya (Hahaa)

[Hook][Intro]
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen
(Guess the dream is true hah?)

[Young Jeezy]
Uh yea wussup?
It’s the world baby
Uh yea wussup?
It’s the world baby

[Hook]
I was on my grind when I was 17
Only half a thing for a stack worth of 17
Took a road trip, came back, have me 7 nins
When I turn 18, I’m worried by 7 things

Yea, look, take ‘em back when I was 17
17, I had a cutlass it was extra clean
Always thuggin’, always on the scene
It’s the word it’s 2 to bat, need some bigger chings

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
I gotta get it, I want, I gotta have it
Tie the knots in the bag then I’m right back at it
Yea, 14 grams in my attic
The dealer or the user, who’s really the addict?
For this fast money I'm addicted
She kick me out the house, I got evicted, damn
Guess mama don’t love me no more
Said she might not even let me use her oven no more
125, fresh off the press, smell the aroma
My uncle slick on the couch, he in a coma
And I swear that shits louder than an ambalance
Came back with extra 50, did the hammer dance
My grandma keep telling me I need some help
But I keep tellin’ her that I need some wealth
Cutlass with the alpine, got the two knobs
Blow and the hard, bitch I got me jobs

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Freddie Gibbs]
At 17 I had a 9 with 17 shots
East 17, 5-17 block
Fitted to the left, whole hood claim Lord
Shout my niggas from valley Bronx to Concord
Nigga, used to play ball
Class, I took the day off
Tryna buy some new J’s, hopin’ I get the skate off
Fully automatic shootouts, call that a spray-off
Before I ever see 17, I bust the K off
And my homie got me blowed in the worst way
7 gram for 17 birthday
In the school hall we was getting cheddar there
Seventeen hundred in my Letterman
When I was 17

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Slick Pulla]
17, we was the clean team
Up in Lenox food court, polo’d up, pullin’ everything
Some lil niggas ‘bout their fra skins
Got my first QP 5 points from the africans
Had ‘em dimes stuffed fat then
Had ‘em stashed in the old spice can, thought I was slick then
Then it went to whole with Nando and Cho
Went from halfbacks to four ways a glass
Then it went to black vans and the task
Now we drinkin’ milk, throwin’ up slabs
Young and wild, chest out for the cash
Just a little nigga tryna come up on some green backs

[Hook][Intro x6]
Snow, Snow Go

[Hook : Jeezy]
First you open up the bricks, see the logo
Cocaine prices up and down, yeah its pogo
Fresh Louis V button down no Polo
That’s a snow go, snow go, Yeah a snow go
First you open up the brick see the logo
Snow go, that’s a snow go
See the flakes in this bitch that’s a snow go

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Ain't nobody trippin’, money already made
And the plug ain't trippin, he already paid
Talking white home jerseys, them Atlanta Hawks
Twenty seven a kilo-gram that Atlanta chalk
Bout to knock em’ all off, this a murder scene
Until there’s nothing in the bag, that bitch is murder clean
My nigga fuck what you heard these niggas barely happen
My nigga fuck what you heard this the birdy captain
Follow Ben Walt to get a few snapbacks
And all they scream is snow, please bring the trap back
Broke an eighteen down into eight teens
Was working with an eighteen when I was eighteen

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
Fuck a green light see this a snow go
Got us some walkie-talkies for the po-po
I’m fresh as hell, YSL
I drop it in the pot and watch that girl swell
When I’m dropping on the block they say “that boy hell”
Young hard ass nigga man, that boy shell
See thru top, yeah I’m bail swell
Blowing loud in traffic, nigga fuck jail
I hit him in the chest, he couldn’t exhale
Kinda clumsy with the K, but grip that fin well
And every time I hit that [??], man it fish-tail
A snow go, bring the Glock, we got them big scales

[Hook: Jeezy][Intro]
[Girl] Jeezy?..

So as I hit the do' she already know it's on (I'ma tear dat pussy up)

Stand up at the trunk gettin' my grown man own

[Hook]

For some strange reason she likes to do it in the car (damnn)

So I keep it gangsta with her, let her come to the house (heyy)
Let her play matter wit slick, when we in the bedroom she like to play with the stick (yea...)

She came first, I came last, roll the grass...(heyy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Slick Pulla]
We pull bad hoes, rip them, push them to the side
Cuz real players, keep reserves when its clutch time
Matter fact, my bottom bitch love to ride pine
She know when daddy leave the block, that its cut time
I'm in the trenches, gettin' riches wit my comrades
We fold hoes up, like slacks in the player path
Pretty skin, silky hair, plus that ass fat (uh huh)
Fresh kicks on your feet, ya I'm diggin' that
Slick consako, yo boys slingin' wood bitch
You want that straight drop dick
Come to the hood bitch
I like scout them ghetto hoes up in 20 grand
Cuz them the ones be wit that freaky shit man
Two drinks, three beans, now she rollin man
The tool in her throat, I'm just tonsil patrollin man
True pro's with this shit, we ain't new jacks
We drill hoes and switch 'em up like fitted caps

[Hook][Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Last time I checked I was the man on these streets
They call me residue, I leave blow in these beats
Got diarrhea flow, now I shit on niggas (geah)
Even when I'm constipated I still shit on niggas (let's get it)
Got some Super Friends in the Legion of Doom
Stay blowin purple shit that keep me high like the moon

Niggas sneak dissin', that ain't how we play
Fuck with mine, get ya drama like the DJ (that's right)

Inner tubes like the tires on my Mongoose (heyy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Yeah, back up in the hood again, where it's all good again
Ridin candy slab, grippin on the wood again
Outta line niggas get back in place where you should've been
In case you don't understand, I'mma make it understood again
King of the underground, my gangsta will never fail
You 'bout to make me go postal for fuckin with my mail
You got the connect, but you ain't got the clientele
You the hoax and niggas know it, that shit ain't hard to tell
Rat bitch, recognize that your cheese ain't finna sell
I'm finna break some bread with the feds? You dumb as hell
I been around the block before, sold it all from rock to blow
And I don't fuck around, when the feds in town I got to go
Respect my mind cause I'm a trill old schooler
Summer time get too hot, I wait for winter when its cooler
U.G.K. for life, free the Pimp, you know the deal
In P.A.T. it's Trap or Die and we ain't down for gettin killed

[Hook][Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]

Yeah, yeah, I said yeah nigga, yeah
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
Look, look, look

What the fuck is up?
Heard it's goin' down
Headed to my bitch house on the other side of town
Plus that Remy got my head spinnin' round and round
100 miles per hour and I'm smellin' like a half a pound

Soon as I hit the door, she comin' out her panties
Got a nigga all excited, like I won my first Grammy
I'm a boss mo'fucker, I do it B.I.G.,
Tell King Kong he ain't got shit on me
'87 head to toe, I got that shit on me
And yeah your girl a real rider, she like to sit on me
I told her all the sites zone, you can chill on me
And I don't want your bitch holmes, so you can chill on me
And if the nigga insecure, then you can count on Young
100% guarantee that he won't get sprung
He was blowin' up her phone, she was on my lap
The way she was blowin' a boy, almost forgot my strap

I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', and I don't know why

I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', and I don't know why

[Verse 2 - Slick Pulla]

I'm trippin' 'em all my fault, (okay)
The way I swith it for these hoes they call me flip mode, (why?)
Cause I bust 'em up (okay), then I dig 'em out (alright)
The I roll a spliff (talk to her), then I kick 'em out
Got my rider broad, I ain't bring the kittens out
Cause they get nervous when a nigga bring them splittas out
They say I'm trippin', I say chill baby calm down
So you just standin' there teacher get the man down
That nigga trippin', don't he call himself Young O Day?
Plus I don't play, I let it spray, I'm all about my pay
And if you think I'm trippin' fuck you and bave a nice day
And while you think I'm trippin, I'll be trippin' to the bass

I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', and I don't know why

I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', and I don't know why
