[La the Darkman]
Yeahhh...
L.A.D
I'm all about that cheese, swiss or mozerella
Muenster, kobe, American or cheddar
When it come to robbery, nobody do it better
Notorious L.A.D, fresh Coogi sweater
The cleanest, lyrics is the meanest
Understand my English, nigga I'm a genius
Ice like a snow cone, writin' in my iPhone
Went from sellin' crack to sellin' ringtones
Straight out the projects to million dollar homes
Inside the Carter, cookin' 36 zones
36 O's and I break them all down
In and out of every trap, all through the A-town
The Embassy A.M.G, Young Money merger
I'm a Young Champ Like Ben Roethlisberger
S.S. Chevy with the big block engine
Rims and paint cost me a whole pension

[Jae Millz]
I don't need nothing but my niggas and enough weed to go around
A tinted sedan, some grams and loaded pound
Fuck what another nigga think of me
I'm thinkin' multi-millions, he thinkin' G's
Nigga please, get your mind right
Fuck tryna be fresh, get your grind right
Cuz I'm like, so in another league
I throw my pitches at different degrees
And I spiril my pigskins at different speeds
And I hit threes cuz at different times I release
My shot cold, nigga, I'm Hot
Don't be tight cuz you not
Just be happy I'm lettin' you breath
I'm the good, I'm the bad, I'm the devil, I'm Jesus
Its Young Money Bitch, the game needs us
Gudda Gudda, what it is nigga?
Kid-Kid Chi, get it how you live nigga
My nigga Mack Maine just left the dealership
And Weezy just ripped the drop Phantom so they feelin' sick
Diamond rings, diamond chains, royal suites, private planes
Palm trees, big change, I can't complain
I made a promise to myself that I'll never be have-not
Nigga fuck being broke, shit
Before that day come, I'll A.K. stamp ya
When there's beef, I'm in the center like Tyson Chandler
Fuck what you heard, in the booth I goes off
Like the lights if you ain't payin' us the third
And you already two months late witcha bill
Clown nigga you's a lame, bitch nigga, I'm Millz
Young Mullah

[Gudda-Gudda]
If you didn't, now you know
Its the million dollar nigga with the million dollar flow
Icicle chain got a million dollar glow
Quarter mill for the gang if you tryna book a show
Temp plates on the Bentley, ridin' through the 'jects
Got a pocket full of money nigga, Hand on my tech
I'm demandin' respect, I'm a man to respect
Disrespect your man, put my hand 'round his neck
Its no other than Gudda Gudda man
Still bout my money nigga, fuck another man
I'm on the paper chase, all about the hustle man
I be climbin' through your window like I'm fucking Bruh Man
Look I'm - Shady Aftermath, put your head in a scope
A bank roll with bucks is what these young niggas killin' for
The game dirty on the streets tryna deal Yayo
Fifty clips at his hat leave a peeled potato

[Lil Wayne]
I call my nina bay like San Diego
Get me twisted and I'm a turn into a tornado
And all my riders ridin' like a Winnebago
You stay, but I'm a let that A.K. go
Rawer than a qualo, shoot you like Halo
Give ya ass a halo
These bitches walk around actin like they J.lo
Man, I remember when these bitches was just hey ho
Hey ho, how you doing?
Me, I'm doing every fuckin' thang
Smokin' them dykes, I'm on that Mary fucking Jane
This shit so Tom and Jerry to Lil Wayne
And you MC's are just milk and cherries to Lil Wayne, ha
And bitch I'm greedy
But if I keep eatin' you rappers, I'll get sugars diabetes
Sweetie, I'm a different species
I'll crush your two fingers into a million pieces
What the fuck do I be thinkin?
Kill, kill, murder and Benjamin Franklin
Your girlfriend is into them gangstas
And me being a gangsta, I get into your girlfriend
I stay still when the world spins
And ain't nobody flyer than the Birdman
You heard me, you heard him
Him being me
And we are better than
All you y'all bitches, niggas, hoes
Enemies, foes
Threes, twos, ones
But these dudes won[Intro: Ras Kass (Scaramanga Allah)]
Yeah, yeah
Sham's nine times ultra
Wu-Tang herbs two times great, you heard of me
Nigga, L.A.D., six times ill
Rest in peace O.D.B
La the Dark, Sun large
GZA, Ras Kass, yeah what's up, Wu-Universal
Legendary

[Verse 1: Scaramanga Shallah]
Now it's the real beginning of the pages of Shams
Spit that heat rock that make fiends make vapors of grams
Sham's is the greatest fan, rock big cables of sands
Valleys and trunks, I got the mack ten
We can hit the alley with iron and thumper
Take it to the hands like the brand new Leonard
Niggas going no mas, when the bullets go in him
You dealing with a night stick toker
The ice pick poker, trust you ain't like this joker
And the set, devoted to opening your neck
With the tech, as you sit in a Lex'
Your next move, is slipping, your last move is shitting
As your body gets soft, the shotty went off
Little soldiers, you're out of position
Guns go off, Shams is a Raiders fan
A rhyming gallop reporter, columns are lost
White five, black five with dollars to toss
Twisted by the dark side of the force
Black biscuit, by park side in a Porsche
You're off sides in the fort
We are survivors of the war of good and evil
I'm in the hood, in the hood with a Desert Eagle
With my Brooklyn peoples, now feel it

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
Darkman, my persona's like Tony Montana
How he used to sniff coke, how I puff marijuana
Try, play me today, I'mma kill you ma√±ana
From, far with the K, or up close with the llama
I'm like an African king in a castle in Guana
Chest dripping with jewels, one hell of a rhymer
Study lessons in Athena, building with an old timer
So I, always been wise ever since a young minor
Get CREAM by any means, follow Malcolm X theme
So I'm often posted, in a rumor with that thing
Got a limited support from the Sing-Sing regime
I'm Hannibal Smith and they like the A-Team
Keep my head on the swivel, when I serve a dope fiend
Upgraded, to a digital, from a triple beam
Fucking with me, you better be real as you can be
La Trapacandi, a well known rhyme general

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
Who say Ras Kass don't spit fire, he a liar
That's like your favorite rap star claiming he gon' retire
When you mention me, not about penitentiary
Wins and rhyme skills, both twenty second century
Ahead of my time, school niggas like Timbuktu
Cause I'm original, like Black Falasha Jews
Velours by BUFU: Buy Us, Fuck you
Try us, fuck you
You die y'all got gats but him buck too, nigga
Sip the Grey Goose and ponder, then order room service
In Hotel Rwanda, reminder to honor these street scholars
Who ask why U.S. Defense is twenty percent of the tax dollar
Bush gave 6.46 billion to Halliburton
For troops support efforts in Iraq
Meanwhile, the hood is hurting, please believe that
The rape over, Chaney talking, twenty five dollars for a case of soda
Draining tax payers, eighty five thousand dollar oil filters
But won't pay they soldiers, Halliburton workers make
Fourteen thousand dollars a month, privates earn thirteen g's a year
Please who twenty-five extra, taking fire in combat
Recruit all the niggas, that die from where I'm at
18 years old, talking kill, where Saddam at
But can't have a gat, to protect where my Mom's at
I love to crunk, so what, plus I'm gangsta enough
To piss in Pimpin Ken's, pimp cup, rack a gauge and pump it up
Hot bitches still get fucked, niggas just want a forty and a blunt

[Verse 4: GZA]
Yo, these youngsters they grow up on the block
With the product in they socks and the fully loaded Glocks
Too many die in vain, and it's a crying shame
The murders and the hustles, won't stop as they shoot for the top
Acquiring apparel, through growth and development
On they most dangerous missions, excuses were irrelevant
The brutality of war, never changes
And the out of control desire to win, makes it dangerous
Fire engulfed the set, they feel the threat, greater than
What they ever had, experienced yet
Indictments, sparked excitement, and the thrill to kill
Suddenly they felt the need for a challenge in they field
The great boundaries of both man and machine
Can have one at the point, to murder all in between
Yellow tape scene, dead teen, the mob was his idol
Giving a grim new meaning to the neighborhood's title, what's up[Trey Songz]
Wah ah ohh oh, ohh oh
Wah ah ohh oh, ohh oh

I got the love for money
I gotta have it
The lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love For Money
I gotta have it
Love For Money
I got the love for money

[Willie the Kid]
Chillin wit two women
Me & Mr. Thanksgiving
I be somewhere fly
Thanksgiving goin' swimmin'
While you was wearin' snorkels
I was out snorkelin
Of course, I'm shittin' on these ni99as like porcelain
It's more than love wit this money
I'm infatuated
Captivated by the diamonds encapsulated
Shootin' range in the basement
Olympic size pool, a pool table adjacent
I love me some money!

[Gucci Mane]
I stash money, fast money
Come on, I'm pumpin them onions
Buckin and crossin the country
So So, don't cross me you monkey
Sleepin' on fifties and twenties
Rollin' up onions and hundreds
Pullin' in Porsche's and Phanny's
Fancies be throwin' they panties
Drama and Cannon they family
Gucci and Drama they panic
Ughh, they sick, they vomit
Put some more commas in front it
Drama got Gucci, he stunted
Gucci and Drama, we jammin'
We got so much money
Bout our money, so money
Mo' money dummy

[Hook 2x]

[LA the Darkman]
See Money!
Money got a big house
Money got a bad girl
Money make you famous
Money rule the whole world
Money set trends
Money is in the Benz
Money got associates actin' like friends
Money Money he old
Money Money he bold
Money got sexy ladies dancin' on the pole
Money got em' on the stroll
Money platinum and gold
Money make em' shake it like Beyonce Knowles

[Yung Joc]
Only God knows
The things I do for money
That's a young fly bad bitch, a tenderoni
Check out them dimensions
Twenties, fifties and hundreds
Don't she make me look good
When you see us out stuntin'
Ni**as catch a whiff
Find out that's your b*tch
Catch a pusha in your whip
Then they go and push them clips
She got me goin' crazy
I'm coo coo for boo-koo bucks
Plus I can't lie boo, its only you I love!

[Hook 2x]

[Bun B]
I'm bout my issue
I'm bout my dough
I'm on my hustle (man)
You already know!
I'm hittin' stains
I'm hittin' liqs
I'm packin' pounds
And baggin' bricks
You got them nicks
I got a lab
You talking whole's
But sellin' halves
Where's your connect
How much he got
That's all he holdin'?
Man I'll buy him out...

[Hook 2x][Verse 1: Kobe]
Nigga you know I'm a rider, nickel plated llama
Pull up right beside ya, yup (you know this)
I don't give a fuck bout, What you niggas talk bout
Now you fuckers chalked out, yup (you know this)
True killas, No tellin'
Drug dealin' and convicted felons
Staged that, Drop top seat pushed way back
This is ya funeral service, Switch it to the all black Maybach
Things change nigga this our year
The game need a change, Cold killa right here
Nightmares, For niggas gettin' they sleep on
We keepin' the streets warm
Real rich young niggas
Street Fam for life they can't fuck with us

[Hook: Kobe]
Now I-I-I, Go hard
Yea yea yea, So hard [x3]
SO hard, So hard, So hard, So hard

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Time to send em flowers and cards with our regards
A special rest in peace goes to all you cowards and frauds
Like water in the freezer that's how I go hard
Fly in ya bitches' legs, Twin Tower ya broad
Gotta check ya boy dougie, Check a boy luggy
I scare the shit out niggas, Check ya boy huggies
Death to the competition, Die slow bastard
Black G top on call it closed casket
Black card titanium, No plastic
Black henny shots to the head I'm so blasted
They call me young funeral
And the bitch with badder than my two year old
You niggas softer than a tuna roll, Sushi ass niggas
Bougi ass niggas, With my blues brother's shades I'll Belushi past niggas
Nigga I make it hard like a pretty naked braud
Wassup son

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Cain]
You know ya boy flow extra, I'm harder than concrete
Gimme a couple minutes with a blunt and a hard beat
I'm all street, The hottest niggas is all sweet
I'm listenin', And ain't heard nothin' strong all week
Bury you right beside the gat you in the booth with
I eat ya favorite rapper for breakfast, Gimme a toothpick
These niggas appetizers, Way to bring the entree
I put on for my city so amazing, No Kanye
We runnin' this town, Studda gang all day
We in house and you a Outkast, No Andre
I chase it all day, If I ain't pushin' bomb yay
Remember jack move, Hands up like the song say
Play with Paul pay, I give it up the wrong way
Chrome 44 bulldog pointed the long way
Without the second thought of a doubt
The competition all dead call the coroner out

[Verse 4: La the Darkman]
I'm Hard like Rikers Island bars
Hard, like a inmate from oz
La the Dark, I'll pull ya card
I lead my allegiance like Master Furrah
Oppose me must be a retard
Get ya brain ajarred
Bullets like Brett Favre
Then beat the charge
I'll beat the odds
Big and black
With black cards and black cars
All black everything
Cartel Medillin
Specialize in coke and Methamphetamines
See things cheddar brings
Bisexual hoes, impeccable flows, murcielagos
Car and truck combos
How my song goes
Bang hammers at niggas like africans on congos
Let me slow it down a bit
I'm hard they soft as baby shit
LA![La the Darkman]
I'm nineteen, doing nothing but getting that green
Lexus C, playin' the club scene
Every weekend, catch me with a different Puerto Rican
Mami, who wanna do nothing but slide me
I'm movin' on a twinkies dip, eyes chunky
Gucci hat, Gucci sweater, couldn't feel better
Stayin' at the bar, in the limelight
Got the four fifth and a box cutter, I'm tight
Drink all night, think all night
Rock a new Air Force One's all white
Bitches sweatin' me, niggas eyein' my style
It's all good, ain't fucked a nigga up in a while
Then Fats walked in, then Shay walked in
Then Raboo, Shotti Screw, and Kay walked in
Aight now, my click just stepped in the place
First nigga act up, I'mma blow him in his face
Where Leopard Ed, them niggas at home in the bed
With 'Lonzo, he with his wiz and his seeds, yo
Back to the storo', this nigga keep lookin' at me
That's the same nigga, every weekend, I see
At, every bar, that, I got to
He starin' at me, duke, do I know you?
Nah, you don't know, but I seen you around, though
Shark Bar and Palladium in New Ro'
Geez, I'm tryin' to figure out, this nigga steez
He remember the spots, where he seen me at, please
What's your name, dun? Steve, what you do? Slang trees
You see this platinum Roli', hangin' off my sleeve
My first thought, yeah, get faster ticket
Get his chain and his watch, leave his ass butt naked
Second thought, this nigga gotta be playin'
He got his jewelry, all out in the club
But why he so quick, tell me, he sell drugs
All my niggas drinkin' Crystal, standin' on the wall
Not knowin' this nigga, gon' be, my downfall
And none of us look like, the working type
Nine to five, never had a job in my life
I'm proud of that, whitey ain't pimpin' me
Even though I might see the penitentiary
Still trying to pull a Heist to the Century
Make bitches catch chills when you mention me
Yo Steve, I don't fuck with drugs, yo
Got a record company and we about to blow
Yo money, don't tell me that lame shit
Save it for the cops, I could see you sell bricks
What's your name? La, look La, I ain't the one
Won't you just come kick it with me, sometime, son
We exchange math, hit 'em, straight routine way
Believe, the nigga, hit me up the next day
Yo, La, this Steve, what's the deal, my friend
Yo, I'm havin' a party, and I want you attend
Come through, as a matter fact, bring your crew
Sing Sing Killas, and the niggas from the Wu
Damn, this kid know my whole family
This might be the connect I want, can't be
Cuz he movin' too fast, one day, if he got cash
I'mma check him out, dun, how I get to your lab
It's upstate, take the Deacon in the Westchester
Just come through, La, and I'mma bless ya
I got models, about thirty Crys' bottles
And after they get drunk, they suck and swallow
I'm there, what time, yo, it start around nine
Got thirty girls coming, nothin' less than a dime
I show up at the crib, four garage mansion
Walked in, nothin' but bad bitches dancin'
Some dancing with niggas, some dancing together
I think to myself, it can't get no better
What up Steve, yo, La, my friend
You late, had a hard time gettin' in?
It's good to see you, and your people
Look La, I'mma tell you just what I wanna do
To the point, I got about four hundred bricks
And my only problem is movin' the shit
What you Cuban, Dominican, but what does that matter
My only concern, is makin' your pockets fatter
I'm watchin' you, all the clubs, spendin' cheese
What your stash look like, I guess a hundred g's
For me, that's enough to buy about ten ki's
Ten thousand a piece, chine white, capisce?
Oh no, this shit can't be true
Offerin' that price in New York, should of knew
Yo Steve, I don't play up out my change
La, my friend, this is not a gamee
Think I'd bring you to my home, just to play
Yo, Steve, all type of shit happened today
But anyway, I hope, you keepin' it real
Cuz you know, I might take you up on that deal
Thinkin', to myself, this price is a steal
See him a couple times, son, I could stack a mil'
Hung out with him, Cheetah's, Envy, a few times
Ran a couple train, on a few dimes
I'm kickin' it, harder than I ever did
Copped a house, built an arcade in it for my kids
Race cars, Tekken, pool tables, cool
I'm lovin' my life, everything was goin' smooth
Doin', yeah, forty bricks a month
Drinkin' nothin' but Crys', smokin' hydro blunts
Shay copped a Benz, Fats copped a Benz
Screw copped a Caddy, Kay stacked his ends
And damn, I wish I would of did the same
Everything fucked up when them indictments came
F.B.I. at my door, must of got the wrong name, it's a bust
And sir, you comin' with us
And we know what you been doin', for the last twelve months
Fuck, I got dough, I'm going to trail, yo
But Steve was a fed, Donnie Brasco[Hook]
Hip Hop Rules

[La the Darkman]
Big black skinny Nigga
6'4" with the .44

In the Benzo smokin on Coco
My blood Niggas say I'm true Vatos loco
For real had a Land Cruiser before my deal
Then I copped a 400 Lex and I'm set
Moving through the projects like Tyrannosaurus Rex
Shootin Tex at sets make a Ho clits wet
Now I cash big checks tryin to own assets
Built like the Aztecs
Why you Niggas ass bet

[Vanilla Ice]
Remember Ice Ice Baby
Drove you crazy then I was big as Jay-Z
I got paid and I got swayze
Eatin shrimp with my feet up made me lazy
I bought about 10 cars about 5 cribs
Out in the woods nobody knows where I live
Got a beautiful wife and two kids
But I'm married to Hip Hop and that's how it is
Cause

[Hook] - repeat


[Vanilla Ice]
It's been a long time since you seen me
On the TV V-ICE is here for Sheezy
Takin what's mine
Cause it's my time to hit ya'll with a new style of ryhme
Yeah
This is Hip Rock it can't be stopped
Bomb tha System, Straight to the top
Millions of Dollars I been spendin em
I love rap, I paved the way for Eminem
Needless to say, I rap back today
Ya'll forgot about me like ya'll forgot about Dre
But I'm still here, With no fear
I say what I want and make sure it's clear

[La the Darkman]
Yo
I play ball break jaws break all types of laws
Militant cause haters wanna kill me with a cause
Feel me
I been nice since the P was free
Back when KRS was runnin shit wit BDP
I spit Rapnology wack rappers follow me
Let me take you to my Shaolin temple where scholars be
Studying Astronomy and the world's prophecy
Giving sight to the blind enabling them to see
It's me GOD equal 4 plus 3
Copped a 6 with the V for the year 2G
Stay blowin on trees, How many guns? 23
But it only take one to make you history
My clan hold me nobody control me
So fuck a PO and being Parolee
I write solely light Ray Roley
Not the Bible but I lead a church of Niggas Holy
Because

[Hook] - repeat

[Hook] - repeat


[La the Darkman]
I've got Dawgs up North
I've got Dawgs down South
I've got Dawgs that'll smack blood out of your mouth
Then lick they hand
It's the Darkman brother number 12 from the Wu-Tang Clan
You heard me on Gza you heard me on Deck
That was me with ODB that bust a Tek
La and Vanilla want money like Roc-a-fella
If not I'll have to pop a fella

[Vanilla Ice]
I'm the Illest Caucasian, Rhymes blazin
I went 17 platinum, amazin
Now just listen to the sound I kick
Chillin with my man La, watchin Gangsta flicks
Don't ask why ? I cheer for the bad guy
Maybe it's the Hydro, I'm so high
Or maybe it's the Xtasy gettin the best of me
The Industry keeps on testin me
But I won't fold I'm just too bold
One thing about Ice I stay Cold

[Hook] - repeat

[Hook] - repeat[Chorus: Tekitha]
Street life, is the only life I know
Street life, where we got no place to go
Street life, where we struggle just to eat
Street life, where the drugs and thugs meet

[Verse 1: La the Darkman]
Yo, I bust shots out Glocks with kids that push rocks
Hol' Glocks run in spots with cheese like Fort Knox
Rhyme excellent kill 'em with intelligence
Get money like embezzlement, brilliant as the president
LA the Dark comet, inheriting nature, Islamic
Stay loyal to my clan like Elijah Muhammad
That's a promise, creating them secrets be like a Mason
Every time I touch the track I swing my axe at Satan
Speed racing through life world class
LA let the tech splash
My lyrics hard as brass
Yo, I'm all-star, check me in the Source y'allll
'98 sports car purchase me a sports bar
Dun, I run with smart men, accurate, sharp-shooter, marksman
Running through New York campaigning like Al Sharpton
And sing, my guns be black as Shabba Ranks
Computerized thugs dropping checks in the bank
In this....

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
You on my dick, my life is like a James Bond flick
Mad bitches, mad bullets but I never get hit
Yo, from herpes to trees, TV's and MPV's
Niggas in jail for life that's strong as Hercules
From bloods to Latin Kings, the Bronx back to Queens
Drugs to dope fiends green Rovers to limousine
Prostitutes fourteen sucking dick on porno screens
Vaginas that's unclean clean with terrible hygiene
Describing my block scene is devils at Halloween
The young son got guns with 50 shot magazine
And digital red beams, getting drunk off gasoline
Robbing niggas marked, died for his chain and his cream, in this...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: La the Darkman]
I'm unstoppable, rainbow garment stay tropical
Jewels stay rockable, crystal clear optical
My niggas got bodies get watched like John Gotti
In a mansion with a monk learning Wu-Tang karate
It's a fortress niggas can't afford this
My queens look gorgeous, I think eating swordfish
Surrounded by 20 men cold-blooded at the amphibian
In the Benz puffing trees straight from the Caribbean
It's Darkman, fuck....

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Cash, I love cash kid
Better love it
Root of all evil
I love it dough, it's all good{*evil laughter*}

[La the Darkman]
Yeah, INS, yo
La the Darkman
Hit 'em with the death blow
Yo

Yo, I'm known to spit poems, throw dice and hold tones
Show ice, puff bones, hit beats like Larry Holmes
Through the Valley of Kings, you catch the Killa Bee sting
Tryin to pick up, you fuckin with the archbishop
Defyin me is like startin Rap World War 3
You rather sell your key to NYPD
My style's vicious, I rap in the lab and break dishes
My words wear jet black hoods, lookin suspicious
Darkman

[Beretta 9]
Behold the struggle fire ultra harmonizer, track paralyzer
Artist he the real, blood spilled on the synthesizer
4th, turn it up a peak, make the speaker tweet
Iron Sheik camel clutch a beat, rappers take your seat
In fact punch a clock, it's my time to rock, dock the known like a scott
Engineered this thought that I present, so just
Comprehend, while I fill you in, with a bar or ten
And clear the path for the god Sin, do 'em in kid (Yo)

[Killa Sin]
I stay lurkin, circlin the premises
Dart chemist sent on a search for arch nemesis
Concoctin neurotoxins out of synonyms
Send your physical in triple shock, crippled in a detox with no rememberance
While I rocks the maximum shows for no minimum
Capacity to pack the front row but flow naturally
Killin 'em, swing on the stage like jagged pendulums
And blow like thirty shrapnel grenades with no pins in 'em

[Street Life]
Why risk it? Killah Hill District, we flip shit
Egotistic, I hold grounds with twin biscuits
Put it up, I lay it down, my streets sound surround
Shaolin bound, flash flood watch you might drown
Headliner, move through the city like a sidewinder
Island drifter, black vagina finder
Loungin by the seashore, switch like Bloody Roar
And slap hardcore dick to your main wiz, bitch

[Inspectah Deck]
Toxi' on Bacardi Pina, low crawlin through Medina
Slumped in the seven-seater
Dumpin heaters, to bite might cause seizures
Weak MC's take me to your leader
We the true source, movin off on uncharted course
My thoughts come across with a blindin force
Killa Bees plant seeds, log on
Or get knocked off like a pawn if you dare lock horns

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
You are now in the 9th chamber
Where the falls of reality close in fast on the world of make-believe
And your fantasy is nothin more but a memory
Now bear witness to the realness
Shown and proven
We live by the sword...Intro:

Word up!
Yeah! La The Darkman youknowhatI'msayin'
Word up! takin' you on this expedition, tropicanty
Word up! the underworld mission
YouknowhatI'msayin'
Revolution, yo
Check it out, yo

Chorus:

The La's invincible
You thug cats I'mma stab on pricipal
Better off dead workin' with a glass, go ahead
You got star dream on a corner drinkin' gasoline
My man threw you up in a fiend no contest
Dunn I'm bless and knew a devil in a blue dress
Dunn I'm bless and you a devil in a blue dress

Verse One:

YouknowhatI'msayin', word up! La the Dark...
Yo, this brilliant companion peace to the original
Approach my slang and end up in critical condition
When I let my shell I ain't missin'
Technician, you get stabbed back in position
I know that money bring bitches and bitches on to be trusted
Some rappers sniff coke and others be gettin' dusted
City lights, a minute with new books to read
I feed my man lock down, my physicals and my seeds
I ain't got shit, while you rap niggas be playin' wigs
And you the Vegas in the ditch, makin' life cold switch
I'm invincible, you get dead before you start
My night for sharp, push raps spikes to your art
La fight dirty, I strike first I snatch it a purse
Inside my verse, takin' to the edge of the earth
And throw you over, son you drunk I smack you sober
Assassin, blastin' enough your range rover

Chorus

Verse Two:

Triple darkness, yo, expedition
Yo, I'm from a long weeded stick up
Kids, coke and hustlers
Gars for cars, strong arms, Tech dusters
The streets got me in a ocean deep
Khuan I'm leap, a bum told me life is cheap
My lyric's dancin', lamp and eatin' fish in a Wu mansion
Apart place I'mma dance and only my wiz I'm romancin'
Hostted all you chicken niggas get rosted
I read manuscrip in 97 whips hells is tosted
I say some my minute your Benz and get benit
My guns get more open than a enveloppe with money in it
Where I live it's only crack, fiends and dirty jeans
Shorties on the block with the platinum drug dream
Everything in our seems I got bagged at 14
On a highway runin' guns outta New Orleans
It's La, what you think them niggas trimbellin' pink
Stumblelin' you a cat to turn tough on a drink
Keepin' you lifted remenisce on what Chris did
Pull out the mac and shop for a cat in a scebelian
Right in front of the buildin' with kids playin', Shelly's playin'
On the second floor Shelly mom's prayin'
Got cough by a stray in a window in broad day
And she die, fucked up and had to be that way
It was a drunk nigga who done it

Chorus:

You thug cats I'mma stab on pricipal

You got star dreams on a corner drinking gasoline
My man threw you up in a fiend no contest
Dunn I'm blessed and you a devil in a blue dress
Dunn I'm blessed and you a devil in a blue dress

Verse One:

YouknowhatI'msayin', word up! La the Dark...
Yo, this brilliant companion piece to the original
Approach my slang and end up in critical condition
When I lick my shells, I ain't missin'
Technician, you get stabbed back in position
I know that money bring bitches and bitches aren't to be trusted
Some rappers sniff coke and others be gettin' dusted
City lights, I'm in it with new books to read
I feed my man locked down, my physicals and my seed
I ain't got shit, while you rap niggas be playing rich
Send you to Vegas in a ditch, making life cold switch
I'm invincible, you get dead before you start
My knife is sharp, push rap spikes through your heart
La fight dirty, I strike first like snatching a purse
Inside my verse, take you to the edge of the earth
And throw you over, son you drunk I smack you sober
Assassin, blasting up your Range Rover

Chorus

Verse Two:

Triple darkness, yo, expedition
Yo, I'm from a long breed of stick up kids
Coking hustlers, Gods
Foreign cars, strong arm Tech tusslers
The streets got me in a hold chin deep
Quantum leap, a bum told me life is cheap
My lyrics dancing, lamping, eating fish in a Wu mansion
At Park Place I'mma dance and only my wiz I'm romancing
Posted all you chicken niggas get roasted
I read manuscripts, in 97 whips L's is toasted
I said something, I meant it, your Benz'll get dented
My guns get more open than a envelope with money in it
Where I live it's only crack, fiends and dirty jeans
Shorties on the block with the platinum drug dreams
Everything ain't how it seems, I got bagged at 14
On a highway running guns outta New Orleans
It's La, what you think them niggas tremble in pink
Stumbling, you a cat that turn tough when he drink
Keeping you lifted, reminisce on what Chris did
Pull out the mac and shot five cats and a civilian
Right in front of the building with kids playing, Shells is spraying
On the second floor Shelly mom's praying
Got caught by a stray in a window in broad day
And she die, fucked up it had to be that way
It was a drunk nigga who done it
Word up! youknowhatI'msayin', yo

Chorus

Outro:

Word up!

Bear witness to the god, young thugs don't live long
Life is a game of chess ( you play the pawn), knowledge I born
Walk a righteous path, you can never go wrong

Yo east New York gon ?skin connectin me?, this kid live next to me
Manifests ecstacy, to specialize in treachery
Subliminal, wanted to be nuttin, but a criminal
Wit braids, and doo-loo dropped out the eight grade
Tradin rocks, mad obsessed wit guns, was infected
Should of came amongst gods, could of been resurrected
He expected to live long, holdin the Glock
Never opened up his lessons, never took the salat
Robbed a liquor store, the old man knew him since four
Still slapped him wit the toast, and son emptied the cash drawer
Watchin news flicks, what the kid did, gettin famous
Found the owner in the back of the store, left brainless
The stainless was found, in the sewer three blocks down
The DE's flashed his picture around the Polo Grounds
Kicked his grandmother door down, wit a search warrant
Hand cuffed him in his boxers, tipped off by an informer
He was sentenced to thirty-two, quite quality
Allah rules, he should of listened to his jewels

Chorus 2x
[La the Darkman and Masta Killa]
Young thugs don't live long
Life is a game of chess, and you playin a pawn
I be king, listen to the knowledge I born
Walk a righteous path, and you can never go wrong (word up)

[Masta Killa]

This be the dance of the drunken, niggas found slunken
Over the stand room and one to his head black
All those he drove his next destination of home
Suddenly sniped from civilization
Reality starts to set in, his last thoughts
Flashin back to where it all begun
A shorty who slum for a militant soldier
Who made his bones by holdin down the corner
Never turned snitch even though he was pinched by the Feds
He held his weight and did a bid
A two to six, as he sinned from his cell wit a vengence
He held in his heart like a icepick
Physically, he's cut the fuck up
Tryin to maintain but his head is fucked up
To learn, the word on the streets confirmed
Of the sickness, murderin a family member that turn
Informant, he swore to a code of silence
Who broke it, this lead to bloodshed and violence

[U-God]

This chick Iris out in Queens had a cocaine Lexus
Dime sexes, she rock a leather G necklace
Building reckless, Queen kingpin deathwish
Hit women that'll fuck you and return them ya essence
This evil widow, she pulled a fo'-fo' out the pillow
Wit a silencer, la costra nostra cats, they admired her
They hide a force sting to hit the North Region king of teamster
Head C.E.O. of, a major ring but one thing
Lead to another, a leaf, new recover
She got side-swiped, tied up,  he buck fifty cutter
He shot her both knees then, dumper her in the gutter
It was gorry, the top nigga tortured her for glory
But, he let her live so she could about this story[Intro: Rayson, Zu Keeper]

[12 O'Clock]
What's up, nigga? What, you strung out, you ain't workin no more?

She fuckin' while you on tour, the nigga next door
Y'all even played basketball, should've punched ya in the jaw
Na, nigga need to stay on tour, 10 g's is worth more
She's a chickenhead whore, tryin' to score
I knew a bitch like that before, named Mo'
What a mink in the snow, a ring on the toe
12 O'Clock know, a bitch never want a bitch
Bitch!

[La the Darkman]
Yo 12, this bitch Sky livin' in Bed-stuy
Hon' used to be a dime 'til she started gettin' high
The high school prom queen, now she prom fiend
Her man was 85, so he sold her a dream
Told her he was rich, so she sucked his dick
Swallowed all his cum and she didn't even spit
Suckin' him off in the whip, he loved that bitch
He loved that bitch.. he loved that bitch

[Hook: repeat 3x]

[Shorty Shit Stain]
I know this nigga on the Hill who got mad mils
Some masses, got credit cards, I mean this nigga got big bills
Well, anyway, I'mma sick him
He trust this girl named Dawn, put me on, took the ho Vic 'em
She say he don't be home to caress her
So I undressed her and made her feel better
He got the safe in the basement under the cemented floor
So what more, could you ask for?

[Hook]
Darkman stay on the street with a tool
For these devil worshippers wit' gats and these ignorant fools
Find yourself in the Hudson rocking ce-ment shoes
Middle East, Michigan Grand Rap and gun rule

[Verse 1]
Me and my man contemplating on these future operations
For night clubs two four shit packed like cases
I'm nineteen paid young can only get better
Got cheese in the war trying to be enormous cheddar
Fuck a Coogi sweater stay Wu-Wear fly polo
Pepe jeans new boots kid labelled Asolo
Rolled my dolo, killed from the east
Me and Reef left them twenty hour stole four bricks 100 G's
Twenty-five a piece straight in they mind that's what it's like
Peace to my man Ted who got hit on New Jersey's turnpike
I send a kite, wit a hundred in your money order
Hol' it down in your cage see you back at headquarters
Everything is fine LA blow spots like landmines
Do the knowledge as I kick seven deadly signs
From the Glock that'll make city streets boom dock
The industry is calling me like Cookie wit' rocks
And I can't stop, cocoa plants grow in large crops
Darkman east coast hip hop pad lock
I'm determined to kill the mic like Jews and Germans
Shoot a shell through your chest and leave your rib-cage burnin'
While you smiling I got forty-five to life on Rapper's Island
49507 what you dialling, fight faster pushing up deluxe Dutchmaster
Enter my potential of script it might flash you
Wit impact, of a two hundred pound wind
See you chased by Wu-wolves wit' no way to escape
Do it from the mouth, crush bones cause this is my house
And I'm prejudice give Mark Clayman like whiteys down south

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo, I'm hungry like 3 lions starving in a crack house
Wid guns galore taking Jakes to war
Don't challenge the score from here to Van Couver
I stand wit' this Lex Luger stashed in the Couger
Going through you like needles from Phd's
On any demon, drunken wit' 41 thieves
Crack fiends drug dealers and killers run the block
3 thieves wid' binoculars surveillance to drop
A credit dot little Nookie got hit wid' a shot
From a 4-4 calibre government Glock in front of the shop
Equivalent to gun galleries I better keep the eye locked
Show and prove I'm doing Gs trying to teach these 100 Gs
If I hol' nines I freaked it
To getting all this money is a ancient Chinese secret
The liquid, LA can sit down like a precint
I'm flippin' on you MCs for no fucking reason

[Hook]

Yeah, You know what time it is
Gun Rules, You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Word Up, Yo, yo

[Verse 3]
I spent about 20 Gs on weed as I proceed
To grow up fill my weight 100 Gs
Stacking loot, known to kept blood on my boots
Trapacane burning blazing outta fifth hundred coupes
So what you stupe?, I freezin' ya blind to sub-zero
And kept all devil killers like Robert Shapiro
The LA brings action packed heat like De Niro
I'm ancient in this rap shit king like a Pharoah
A terror, terminatin' false niggas style
Kill a man, his woman, MC and his child
Shit is wild I hold niggas hostage like Riker's Isle
Gotta deceptive, murderous money gettin' smile
I'm the judge while you on trial supreme, Killa Bee
A serpent LA can bite the whole industry
..Motherfucker

[Hook]

Gun rule, Gun rule

Triple Darkness

Nigga you know I'm a rider, nickel plated llama
Pull up right beside ya, yup (you know this)
I don't give a fuck bout, What you niggas talk bout
Now you fuckers chalked out, yup (you know this)

This is ya funeral service, Switch it to the all black Maybach

We keepin' the streets warm
Real rich young niggas

[Hook: Kobe]
Now I-I-I, Go hard
Yea yea yea, So hard [x3]
SO hard, So hard, So hard, So hard

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Time to send em flowers and cards with our regards
A special rest in peace goes to all you cowards and frauds
Like water in the freezer that's how I go hard
Fly in ya bitches' legs, Twin Tower ya broad
Gotta check ya boy dougie, Check a boy luggy
I scare the shit out niggas, Check ya boy huggies
Death to the competition, Die slow bastard
Black G top on call it closed casket
Black card titanium, No plastic
Black henny shots to the head I'm so blasted
They call me young funeral
And the bitch with badder than my two year old
You niggas softer than a tuna roll, Sushi ass niggas
Bougi ass niggas, With my blues brother's shades I'll Belushi past niggas
Nigga I make it hard like a pretty naked braud
Wassup son

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Cain]
You know ya boy flow extra, I'm harder than concrete
Gimme a couple minutes with a blunt and a hard beat
I'm all street, The hottest niggas is all sweet
I'm listenin', And ain't heard nothin' strong all week
Bury you right beside the gat you in the booth with
I eat ya favorite rapper for breakfast, Gimme a toothpick
These niggas appetizers, Way to bring the entree
I put on for my city so amazing, No Kanye
We runnin' this town, Studda gang all day
We in house and you a Outkast, No Andre
I chase it all day, If I ain't pushin' bomb yay
Remember jack move, Hands up like the song say
Play with Paul pay, I give it up the wrong way
Chrome 44 bulldog pointed the long way
Without the second thought of a doubt
The competition all dead call the coroner out

[Verse 4: La the Darkman]
I'm Hard like Rikers Island bars
Hard, like a inmate from oz
La the Dark, I'll pull ya card
I lead my allegiance like Master Furrah
Oppose me must be a retard
Get ya brain ajarred
Bullets like Brett Favre
Then beat the charge
I'll beat the odds
Big and black
With black cards and black cars
All black everything
Cartel Medillin
Specialize in coke and Methamphetamines
See things cheddar brings
Bisexual hoes, impeccable flows, murcielagos
Car and truck combos
How my song goes
Bang hammers at niggas like africans on congos
Let me slow it down a bit
I'm hard they soft as baby shit
LA![Verse 1: Killa Sin]
Ski masked, the First National for a half a mill'
It's real, fuck rational
Your armored truck stuck like dustheads for my collateral
Certified criminal, gun smuggling villain who be filling clips
Fuller than cum swelling your genitals

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
Specialist, cat burglar, stocking cap murder
Uzi clip inserterer, you got cheese, I heard of ya
You dirty rat, maneuvered through traps and torched doors
Plastic explosives, bags of C-4

[Verse 3: Killa Sin]
Yo, flash a cannon, deliver these clowns an understanding
That Cash Rules, don't nothing move kid, five-hundred grand an'
The raw son, making assault when armor wait till the gold lock
Fuck the wreck, fumbled up the wrong time

[Verse 4: La the Darkman]
Yo, I clip the phone lines, cut the alarm, the pipe bomb
Detonation, seven minutes the first task, we in it
Lace the tear gas, put on your mask, load the bags
Check the roof for the jake, I'mma climb the gate last

[Verse 5: Killa Sin]
Scan the Internet, copy the floppy shut the drive off
'cinerate the whole data bank before we slide off
Time check: twenty-four hundred and still wasting
The minutes keep racing, let's blow this foundation

[Verse 6: La the Darkman]
Keep patient, I got the whole Dole administration
On CD-Rom, smuggling firearms
And the date to attempt assassinate Farrakhan
From his Middle East trips and building with Saddam
Yo hold the laptop

[Chorus: Killa Sin and La the Darkman] (x2)
Yo it's the Heist of the Century kid we execute right
We going down in history, get the loot and live life
How it's meant to be
A stolen legacy, live Egyptian mystery, (word up)

[Verse 7: Killa Sin]
We on the way out (stolen Legacy), the future laid out
Our brain scrambling Arnez break a cold sweat but never panicking
Shooken up, two officers looking up, we spot 'em
Pull the heat out, and have both they asses red-dotted

[Verse 8: La the Darkman]
Don't move, we got the bank money not yours
Think of your kids and calmly lay on the floor
Put your hands high, dunn get they guns
Then break 'em, slap one with the barrel
Make 'em bleed then tape 'em

[Verse 9: Killa Sin]
It's like a minute and ten left, we playing with death
And I can hear the bomb tick
Sweat drip on the back my palm grip
Final mission, completed all bank funds depleted
Hit the turnpike, bounce to the stash, let's split it even

[Verse 10: La the Darkman]
Yo, the blueprint went excellent
Wisdom-God seconds for the dynamite
On the next flight before daylight
Exit through the back entrance, jump the fence
Then slide in the Rover with the triple black tints
We hit the government, word up Dunn
We hit the government, know what I'm saying?

[Chorus: Killa Sin and La the Darkman] (x2)[Hook]

Big black skinny Nigga

In the Benzo smokin on Coco
My blood Niggas say I'm true Vatos loco
For real had a Land Cruiser before my deal
Then I copped a 400 Lex and I'm set
Moving through the projects like Tyrannosaurus Rex
Shootin Tex at sets make a Ho clits wet
Now I cash big checks tryin to own assets
Built like the Aztecs
Why you Niggas ass bet

[Vanilla Ice]
Remember Ice Ice Baby
Drove you crazy then I was big as Jay-Z
I got paid and I got swayze
Eatin shrimp with my feet up made me lazy
I bought about 10 cars about 5 cribs
Out in the woods nobody knows where I live
Got a beautiful wife and two kids
But I'm married to Hip Hop and that's how it is
Cause

Needless to say, I rap back today
Ya'll forgot about me like ya'll forgot about Dre
But I'm still here, With no fear
I say what I want and make sure it's clear

[La the Darkman]
Yo

Militant cause haters wanna kill me with a cause
Feel me

Back when KRS was runnin shit wit BDP
I spit Rapnology wack rappers follow me
Let me take you to my Shaolin temple where scholars be
Studying Astronomy and the world's prophecy
Giving sight to the blind enabling them to see
It's me GOD equal 4 plus 3
Copped a 6 with the V for the year 2G
Stay blowin on trees, How many guns? 23
But it only take one to make you history
My clan hold me nobody control me

I write solely light Ray Roley
Not the Bible but I lead a church of Niggas Holy
Because

[Vanilla Ice]
I'm the Illest Caucasian, Rhymes blazin

Now just listen to the sound I kick
Chillin with my man La, watchin Gangsta flicks
Don't ask why ? I cheer for the bad guy
Maybe it's the Hydro, I'm so high
Or maybe it's the Xtasy gettin the best of me

One thing about Ice I stay Cold

Niggas ain't Gs they motherfucking liars
The industry full of fruits like papaya
Shoot em in they neck and they back like (?)
I roll like a Michelin tire
I annihilate those who perpetrate
I squeeze, I don't hesitate
The four-five will set a crooked nigga straight
You hate, I participate
O '10 Benz with the temporary plates
Rolling to the club, about to find me a date
Shit is simple, it ain't rocket science
Grand Daddy Purp, know I get the highest
Embassy jean jackets know I'm the flyest
Anybody can bite the bullet, I ain't biased
I get it in, my connect Mexican
Prices so low, it's a win-win

Casualties bound to happen over cash actually
Or perhaps a nigga just jealous, it baffle me
It's Willie

Niggas where I'm from only understand savagery
Casualties bound to happen over cash actually
Or perhaps a nigga just jealous, it baffle me
So, get shot, quick fast on the double
This black 40 Glock inside my Moncler bubble
More money, more trouble
Never meddle with the rubble
I ball never double
Get the drawers never cuddle
I play my cards right
Caught a play inside the huddle
Caught inside the shuffle trying to muffle the rebuttal
Niggas don't bite they just barkin' through the muzzle
Everything in moderation I prefer to keep it subtle
I know Young LA, the real Young LA
Willie the Kid, I'm going hard doing 2 a days
Anyway, nigga understand my vision
On a boat Lake Michigan a couple chicks fishin'

[La The Darkman]
Yo, it's Born God, I survive, Park shit is still real
You know sex, money, drugs, death, the whole ordeal
Murderers to kill, henny demon and ill
Jump in my rocket to the moon, spark an L and just chill
I got to own stocks and bonds, kid, just because I want them
And million dollar businesses with Darkman written on em
Not up front but an economical stunt
I want it all, I hope I didn't put that too blunt
Educate, moving on up like the Jeffersons
Cop a Lex, a Jag, a Land Cruiser and a Benz
And a mafia of friends to dispose my foes
Stand over my shoulder while I head crack a C-lo
Taking care of my peeps cause I know how it be
Mad court cases and white papers, that's all we see
From the roll of poverty but I always got mine
Smuggle from Now Y to M.I. on the mainline
Now I'm in cash field still persuing my path
Sever the mic in half to unleash my wrath
I want an abundance of girls to escape the world
Throw a party on solo, me and seventeen pearls
Puffing on mad lah, dunn, without a regard
I need thirty-three acres of ganja growing in my backyard
Four courts in the front and bathrooms as big as kitchens
Two thousands gallon aquarium to sink my sharks in
All for one on estate, my whole crew living great
Enter the gate unannounced and you will meet your fate
I'm up Carlito's Way, rolling with the real
Protected to infinity in a security shield

[Chorus x2: La The Darkman]
I want it all, lex and techs and shit
I want it all, a fly wiz and crazy kids
I want it all, Pelle Pelle's and diamond jewels
I want it all, and my four-pound to buck them fools, aight?

[La The Darkman]
I've been hungry since a youth, product of the Bronx
P.J.'s and killer ways, ain't a damn thing changed
I got to snatch mine, did it for the whole world and
Eases to Jesus to drink on Chesterfield cuban links
Stinging stones on the medallian, I escaped the Island
Don't give a fuck about you, I'm from the Shaolin Asylum
Which way you want it, I need condo's and hoes
Cess, best guests, vortex and black timbo's
Eight-fifty B.M., a lighting system that's dimmed
Young Deniro damager, sitting above the rim
La The Dark', my hustling goal is to live great
Cause I'm a New York nigga catching money out of state

[Chorus x2]

[Outro: La The Darkman]
Word, Born God year, you know?
It's La The Darkman right here
Word up, marvelous, I keep it spicy, kid
Know what I'm saying? For my mad av. cats
You know? B.D.F.B., you know?
Word up, murderous

I couldn‚Äôt have done things differently. But he was wrong. Things can always be done differently, only he was in a hurry. He didn‚Äôt want to wait, he wanted it all, and he wanted it now. But he‚Äôd forgotten that God doesn‚Äôt work that way, His clock isn‚Äôt set like ours is. When the pay off comes, He takes lives, He cuts deep, He decides[Chorus: sample] (x4)
If you had the strength to walk out that door

Can't live with 'em
Can't live without 'em, uhh
But one thing they have to understand
That knowledge is first
Word up, You know
Love

[Verse 1: La The Darkman (Mala Campbell)]
We started off back in high school my new boo
She stunted at first but I seen right through
Her whole chemistry so I behaved rather friendly
A fly rude boy and she seen the truth in me
She was a natural beautiful skin and white teeth
Her sandals displayed her feet
I like her technique she wasn't in the street most of the time
Pure personality which labeled her a dime
She had a virgin mind
Style with good conversation
Knew the important virtue of patience
Stay wonderful respectable middle class queen
But I ran the street been indulged with other things
Time passed our relationship elevated
She wrote my man letters while he was incarcerated
I remember we thought she was pregnant one time
I stayed by her side and she wouldn't let me rhyme
It was love at first touch for me and this miss
She only complained about the time that I spent
In her hand I told her love understand as a man
I gotta live out my plan providing for my family is a must
And all I ask from my woman is love and trust
My life is difficult being a businessman artist
I might be out of state but I think of you regardless
I'm bogged, I look into your eyes and get hard
I'll make you my planet and I'll be the God
Don't make me choose between you and my career
Gotta take this opportunity love while it's here
I care, completion is man woman and child
My people bass tips just to make me smile
I know every woman's dream is to have a ring
A strong man to hold and the finer things
Cause you can cook and clean keep the Power-U tight
Be a wifey I'm coming home on the next flight
But if you can't respect my laws and be what I need
The God have to leave cause life will proceed, I still Love

(If you had the strength to walk out that door)
Word up
(If you can walk out that door)
To all the boos is still love
You know
(I gave you all I had and all I have is love)
(When you're in love, when you're in love)
(I gave you all I had and all I have is love)
(When you're in love, when you're in love)
(When you're in love, ohoh)
(I gave you all I had)
(I gave you all I had)

(If you had the strength to walk out that door)[Trey Songz]
Wah ah ohh oh, ohh oh
Wah ah ohh oh, ohh oh

I got the love for money
I gotta have it
The lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love For Money
I gotta have it
Love For Money
I got the love for money

[Willie the Kid]
Chillin wit two women
Me & Mr. Thanksgiving
I be somewhere fly
Thanksgiving goin' swimmin'
While you was wearin' snorkels
I was out snorkelin
Of course, I'm shittin' on these ni99as like porcelain
It's more than love wit this money
I'm infatuated
Captivated by the diamonds encapsulated
Shootin' range in the basement
Olympic size pool, a pool table adjacent
I love me some money!

[Gucci Mane]
I stash money, fast money
Come on, I'm pumpin them onions
Buckin and crossin the country
So So, don't cross me you monkey
Sleepin' on fifties and twenties
Rollin' up onions and hundreds
Pullin' in Porsche's and Phanny's
Fancies be throwin' they panties
Drama and Cannon they family
Gucci and Drama they panic
Ughh, they sick, they vomit
Put some more commas in front it
Drama got Gucci, he stunted
Gucci and Drama, we jammin'
We got so much money
Bout our money, so money
Mo' money dummy

[Hook 2x]

[LA the Darkman]
See Money!
Money got a big house

Money is in the Benz
Money got associates actin' like friends
Money Money he old

Money got em' on the stroll
Money platinum and gold
Money make em' shake it like Beyonce Knowles

[Yung Joc]
Only God knows
The things I do for money
That's a young fly bad bitch, a tenderoni
Check out them dimensions
Twenties, fifties and hundreds
Don't she make me look good
When you see us out stuntin'
Ni**as catch a whiff
Find out that's your b*tch
Catch a pusha in your whip
Then they go and push them clips
She got me goin' crazy
I'm coo coo for boo-koo bucks
Plus I can't lie boo, its only you I love!

[Hook 2x]

[Bun B]
I'm bout my issue
I'm bout my dough
I'm on my hustle (man)
You already know!
I'm hittin' stains
I'm hittin' liqs
I'm packin' pounds
And baggin' bricks
You got them nicks
I got a lab
You talking whole's
But sellin' halves
Where's your connect
How much he got
That's all he holdin'?
Man I'll buy him out...

[Hook 2x][Intro: Inspectah Deck]
What is love? Love is love
What is love? (Loving you)

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, examinin her hour-glass frame
Exotic name, passion, splashin the fly fashions
On the 2 train, words soothin her brain
There's the cue, cross the platform, she 'bout to exchange
She wooed slowly in plannin a kiss
And in the same motion, bounced off with the switch
Couldn't let here go, before the train pulled off
She gave me a look that described my thoughts
And I was hypnotized by her ebony eyes
She wised to my scheme, made her temperature rise
Hours later, still zonin off the moment
Happened so fast, it's over with
And now you're gone, like the same short time
But stay so heavy on my mind, I'm...

"Loving you"

[La The Darkman]
Yo, I met a bad chick, model actress
Soft as a mattress, said she was catholic
Physically attractive, earth-toned skin
Thick but thin, looked like she just came off an island
Rolled in Porsches, lady was gorgeous
I'm tryin to ram bar down her mental fortress
Loved my name, La song, how'd you like to have my 4th born?
I'm the God, I'll be your umbrella in a storm
We can smoke, parlay, see a ghetto matinee
Don't worry about me, young thug, cuz I'll stay...

"Loving you"

[Inspectah Deck]
Dana was a girl I knew, she was true
Twist L's with the crew, bust the gat too
Had the stash labbed for when the jake rushed
'nuff head to grab, razors in bags
Lettin me rest my head, wild fugitive
Acceptin all collect calls throughout the bid
Like a big sister, I've got major love
She waved my hair, plus hold a gun in the glove
While you girls move like slippery eels
You the diamond in the rough that been keepin it real
That's why you're closer to me than most I roll with
Smoked bones, rolled dice and made dough with
And now you're gone like the same short time
But stay so heavy on my mind, I'm...

"Loving you" (x2)['Five Deadly Venoms' sample]
I came from a wealthy family
I joined the clan because I wanted to learn
A special kung-fu and be a real expert
But in actual fact I've just become a killer, killing
That's all I know death every day, another

[Intro: La the Darkman]
Gun rule. We gon' make this spicy
It's La Traficante right here
You know? And we gon' do it like this
Yeah. Darkman

[Verse 1: La the Darkman]
Watch the Corleone who give neck ties and puff bones
Stick Arabs for the crystals like Indiana Jones
Witness La, hands of stone, on this action packed odyssey
Majesty, living out the golden book prophecy
Unstoppable, Iron Sheik of rap speaks
Blaze a tree in the street, blue and gray Benz jeep
Tazmanian, rebel, new Wu tycoon
Two thousand-five lyrics, you'll catch on soon
Young entrepreneur, blow Macs to go to war
On tour, blowing smoke out the four by four
Enjoying life, I don't know a man who live twice
Cee-lo, king, rolling dice, holding Glaciers of Ice
Playing '97 Madden at the Loft in Manhattan
While I get blitzed and rich, watch him run short flicks
With a bad chick, La been raw since eighty-six
On the block, new kicks with chocolate skunk nicks
Son, I'm fortunate to still be here, shells is close
City Lights, La The Dark, stay concealing the toast
Cause thieves who deceive get loot the most
But thieves deceive me are left Holy as the Ghost

[Hook x2: La the Darkman]
For that lucci, it's all about that lucci
For that lucci, it's all about that
Getting money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays, kid lucci

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
I'd rather die if I'm not living fly, Now Y
Can't get a job with a corporate, fuck it, I'm getting high
Suicide committed in cells, dwellers square as hell
Children can't have a pants with impairable bells
Suffering in a jail, I don't recognize a soul
Each one with a cold war story that has to be told
Behold the son of God with a scroll
Flame throwing lyrics, niggas best stop, drop and roll
Lyrics is gold, Darkman pushing up in the land
Hit a spot for a Rolex watch, two thousand grams
Then I dip, cause loose lip sure sink ships
But in this drug rap, I bang like the Bloods and the Crips
Guns and clips seem to make my state rotate
Stay on corners till morning, drinking, busting at jakes
Holding my weight, now a purchase 'bout two cakes
When I cook 'em and drop 'em it equal Cali earthquakes
I escape, bagging work on porcelain plates
Get ill like Al Capone after sniffing an eighth
And I'm straight from the halls of Hell, Sing-Sing
Stick a spear through your chest like an ear and an earring

[Hook]

[Verse 3: La the Darkman]
Niggas and sneakers and overnight knight crawler creepers
Crack junkies on the Jones planning a heist to get ya speakers
And that Acura, same soldiers attacking ya
Desert chameleon, no civilian, better know as Dracula
Son, I'm 'bout to see about a half a mil'
With twenty niggas perfecting in kung-fu skills
And fuck bitches, they only want they name on my will
And all you half-ass rappers, kid, you need to be killed
My shit is ill, the ills gave birth to my brain
I represent on all tracks like the Number Four train
Maintain, it's all about the cheese you gain
I get the studies, then the money and the business, fuck the fame

[Hook]

[Outro]
*ringing*
Trying to be broke black
Not me, like these cats say
Fuck that, what you mean, fuck that
How ya live now, fuck that
Fuck you shining right now
You shine, you just beeming
Seed grow up, for him and shit* this exception is permitted due to actual rap lyrics in the Outro

[La the Darkman]
Yeah, killa, The GZA, La
Live, yeah, what yo
My clan is like USA the way we conquer
Lay back, grow more chocolate than Willy Wonka
Stomp ya, till your head bleed, your mouth bleed
Runnin wit the heart of slave that's been freed
Triple Darkness, wild like a killer from Spofford
Heartless, trained to hit movin targets
Profit, .357 cock it
Kill you, leave you wit your money in your pocket
My logic - money, bitches, land and lessons
Allah blesses, me wit automatic weapons
Scholastic, geographic, stay jurassic
Runnin through Medina wit the Glock plastic
Rotten fruit, Black Je-sus, I got juice
Darkman move swift as a mongoose

[Timbo King]
Yo, niggas caught plaque from bitin off the platinum
Dumb MC's caught the gum disease, ask them
Who style they took, two wild rooks
Tried to take a page when I'm the author of the book
At twenty-seven years young, y'all some old timers
I write wit invisible ink, y'all use eye liners
Define rhymers, the question and the answer
The DJ and the dancers, checkCall it Paranoia. Yea
Every day is war. Every day, niggas is gon' hate
Gotta move

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm a walking target
I'm so far from soft, I'm probably close to the hardest
Nigga you ever saw, been never thug, never had a problem
And the shit he never starts, sickest artist there ever was
Nigga found dead in his house, don't know who did it
Yea, you bet it was me, niggas die at the pavement
I'm wavin a nine out of the window and blazin
Is your house shakin
Who's inside nigga, it's funeral time nigga
They die from stray hits, pride wasted
Cry your face, I ain't your suit and your tie
Now look what you made us
Look at the witnesses, all of them look shakin
And alls they seen was the back of a green car with the plate flipped
Look at the news, I did it without puttin a hit out own
You homies in chrome, watch that nigga

[Hook: Royce]
I got my back, because it's my gat
And my mouth that *Started the War*
Lookin around me, got a gun on my lap
While I'm drivin, taking the back routs *Home*
If your headlights is in my rearview
For longer than three lights, and I don't know you
I'mma pull over, And I might shoot you
You should go around me, and don't look at me
'Till after you pass me, cuz I might blast you nigga *I'm at war*
I'm Paranoid, always on point
Always holding nigga, always sober. Call it paranoia

[LA the Darkman]
In your bushes, on the side of your house
Waitin to smoke you when come in from hangin out
Friday night, perfect, I timed it just right
I know you at the club cuz your car is nowhere in sight
I'm like the DC sniper, Mr. Malvo
Strategically precise when I squeeze the cali-co
You look like a asshole, full of shit
Niggas sure to get hit, when my fo-fo spit
Black shirt, black jeans, black boots, black whip
Black mask, paif of black leather gloves for my grip
I don't need no print, a killer with a plan
Makin sure I dont get, gunpowder on my hands
All drama I'mma end it, murder game splended
Leavin all crews for the fucker in forensics
I got, two dependants, I gotta make it home
Clean get-away, two bullets through your dome
Is locked nigga

[Hook] - La the Darkman

[Royce Da 5'9" - spoken word]
And that's just how the story goes y'all
Any nigga where I'm from already knows
Funny, my homie cuz said niggas gon' bring you a bowl of soup when you sick
But if you die, then gonna love you later
Think you a fuckin statue or some shit
God bless these streets, God bless these streets right now
I'mma just be doing my thing so maybe, you know, I could show you how
Don't come lookin for trouble, cuz you just might find it
Don't stand too close to me, I'm always on point, never blinded[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yo, yo
Trafficante, Word up
Here to speak about yo
Polluted Wisdom
Yeah, 2nd Chamber, to all the boos
Polluted Wisdom, 2nd Chamber, yo

[Verse 1: La the Darkman]
I knew this chick named Gina drove a royal blue Beamer
Holdin' 2 chrome ninas fucking baby like Nadina
Wore corn braids, I used to hit it back in the days
Now she a coke slayer Italian niggas gettin her pay
But that's her heritage, she stayed sniffed up, no sorrow
Clean her toes for today gave a fuck about tomorrow
But she robbed 50 Gs flat from a sharp
Now they trying to make the chick history like Noah's Ark
She blew the cheddar, she live on the low where it's better
Copped the condo, some jewels, and a '97 Jetta
Now she know she Big Will but wrong she Silly Sally
Think she handling army cause her body out in Cali
Terribly mistaken strung on yeh the hits creation
Tryin to fly down south with the CREAM from the Jamaicans
It's a woman hunt been on for 'bout 3 months
When they catch her some say they pouring gas in her cunt
Torch it like a blunt and sparked on the God born day
She wanna be a queen but went about all the wrong way
She still hangin in bars, being Diana Ross
Friday and Saturday jumping back and forth in niggas cars
Now I fill wid King at the bar guzzling gin
Thinking he the man cause he gotta 500 Benz
He like it raw when he touch skin Gina just a friend
Not knowing the type of lifestyle shorty was in
From Shaolin..

[Interlude: La the Darkman]
Word up, think again
Know what I'm sayin?, word
To all the wisdoms, living a fast life
Yeah, you rather see the light
Park 'n brake know what I'm sayin?
Word up, it's reality, word up
Yo

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
Driven by grief she live in a plot wid a knot
Been in the block wid ten crisp Gs in her pock
She ain't startin it, joint off safety, three clips
Peep the rear-view some dreads pulled back her whips
So she mercked off they mercked to and drama again
Just bought a first-class ticket going to Michigan
She tried to come out alive grabbed the joint then sat aside
Thinking if she shoot first then her life can't be denied
Started blazing shorty was no joke she blinked
Using rapid fire the dreads trying to hit her gas tank
Testing Uzi ooh op the next man block hot
Through the action four by-standers was shot
But it continued, shorty hittin ninety, scraped the Benz
Still scaring begging Allah for her sins
Wid no friends she had to handle beef on the dolo
3 shells came through the window one went through her Polo
Now she swerving needing a doctor like Jay Ervin
2 other chickens that knew her severe lesson they was learning
Sipping Burbon she reloaded seeing her life being demoted
Catch a flashback remember shit Scarface quoted
Still lickin of shell, feeling the fire of hell
Moved in mad blood trying to make it back to the hotel
Dread licked off a pack she had no chance to react
Firing emptying clips from fifty shot caps
2 more caught her in her back the others made the tire flat
The car flipped 13 times dunn and dead was that
Dead was that, word up black

[Outro: La the Darkman]
Yeah, yo, to all the women
Watch what you do and who you screw
Yeah, be a queen and not a money fiend
Know what I mean, word up
Protect yourslef La the Darkman
Rzarectah[La the Darkman]
Uh uh, for the niggas in black Vigors
Behind the wheel drinkin liquors
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas rockin Tims, fuck cars and rims
Yo, everybody wanna shine

Yo, my dimensions, possessed, lucci, bitches, cess
Lessons, computers, whips, and bulletproof vests
I can't be done, me and Screwface one on one
I drink wit bums in the slums where I shoot my guns
Enforce ones, up north in the Ac, throw a strap
I got niggas down south, holdin nines in Cadillacs
Lettin trees blow, for niggas sniff snow inside the disco
I hold a big pistol, to crack your brain crystal
Cream like Joe Pisco', I fuck your bitch yo
Right through her piss hole
Long dick like a missle
Split the black dutch, while the bracelet on my wrist glow
Cough if I spit mo', sold my Lex, cop the Benzo
My niggas come outta Sing-Seng buff like Lou Ferrigno
The rhyme sayer, quicker Ruger nine sprayer
Rich lifestyle like a young NBA player
And I'm tied to the mob like that gun, called Tommy
Shoot through your Armani, shoot at Guiliani
Shoot at Illuminati, fuck everbody, it's the Darkman
(understand that right there)

Chorus
For the niggas in black Vigors, behind the wheel drinkin liquors
Everbody wanna shine
For the niggas is rockin Tims, fuck cars and rims
Yo, everybody wanna shine
For the niggas that lock downed for bustin caps wit four pounds
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas in Lexus Cruisers wit cocked back Rugers
Yo, everybody wanna shine

[La the Darkman]
Yo, you wanna be me
Sometimes I'm on the block, sometimes I'm on the TV
My crew's greedy, like Boom Boom Mancini
La's song buy weedy, Swahili, Saadiqi
Professional, hold my toast by my testicals
I used to peddle, but three times two equal the devil
Blinded by the ice, and the savage way of life
To no vale, niggas get money in small scales
Start smokin, like they don't know crack kills
A freak nigga, got turned down by a female
Didn't know he sucked death, when he just inhale
I rap life, cocaine, niggas wit no brain
Sellin crack for fifteen years wit no gain
That's a damn shame, check the result of bein broke
Havin no whip, no lab, no money for smoke
He stressed out, really not knowin what life's about
Jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels

Chorus

[La the Darkman]
Yo, yo, dunn I'm felt
Gun in my waist, tight belt
New York streets hot, the bottom of my Wallees melt
I need wealth, puffin my lah by myself
Blessed, wit food clothes and health
And big whips, shorties say I got a big dick
My first video, I rock twenty outfits
The Benz 6, got me wanna flip ten bricks
VCR headrest watchin Scarface flicks
I politic, wit ex cons, old cats, drug dons
Niggas that's known to take a arm for a arm
I move calm as a lion of Juddah, black Garbudda
Silent as a basehead, suckin on his hooter
Cuz Cash Rules, that's why I study new jewels
And keep tools, to create blood pools
For new crews, rappers, on my territory
I cock back the fifth, and make em his-tory
Remember him, the kid wit the big Jesus em-blem
Threw shells from the toast, had his bones tremblin
Nigga, I'm the cat y'all be talkin about dunn

Chorus

Cuz I shine nigga, shine on nigga (what)
Straight shine nigga, nawmean, word up
The sun gon burn out (stay shinin, and stay spicy)
I'mma shine till the sun burn out
Straight up, word, the embassy, my family

Yo, yo, yo, up in the Hilton, buildin, playin outfieldin

Politilly, [nigga], get it right g

[La The Darkman]
Day plannin, jump up, watch the landin
Stay cool, fannin, polly, eatin salmon
At the grill, reminise over who got killed
And if they were here today, pa, how would they feel?
Sun shinin, jet past the block, cats rhymin
See King Gunner, he gained cream this summer
Rolled up a Dacari, blessed my man
Marvelous, wally rocker, lex, 450 land

[Raekwon]
Yo, the barbeque's bangin and my sons look charged up
What up? Fresh cuts buildin when we rest up
Team is righteous, fresh cologne on, probably roll on
Some next club, no slag, throw my gold on
Info, like a hotel, phat, she got stacks
She's a big girl, cover girl laced, wig curl
Goin through the struggles of life is trife
Get your things right, maybe one day you'll be rich wife

[La The Darkman]
Yo, picture good days, young, no bills to pay
I can't 'til I grown, that's what all kids say
Came a long way, cashin checks, duplex
To lampin on planes, rockin 5 g chains
Well known, just bought moms a new home
Check shorty on the swing, playin the cellphone
Lookin lovely, green sundress, no stress
Nails look fresh, painted to impress
It's only love

[Raekwon]
Yo, yo, son, that's my word
Connect dots with all live [niggas] in the world
Start some thesis, exiled, long releases
Though we got family there with little nieces
Six a crash with king Nike Air, yo
Rockin them new Wu glasses, lace my lab, kid
Magazinin', swim, watch, long dreamin
Peace, I'm out, golden globe rapper low-keyin

[La The Darkman, (12 O'Clock)]
Yo, Cuban linkin, lampin at the park here drinkin
Watch the seeds play here free, mind thinkin
Birthdays, presents, learnin, readin lessons
Nine God year, livin in impressions
Splashin, La medallion flashin
(Son, talk your jewels 'fore you jump in the pool)
Aight, du', I stay blacked out by the leaf
Cuz I eat to live, not live to eat
Sayin peace, Nah'I'm'Sayin?
