[Intro]
I want you to tell them
Statik Selektah

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Lets do this man for real
We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, reendorsed yards
Everybody four stars, Rae like forty, jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred Tecs flash
Flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buds ain't only in it for the tokens
Cause they say it's who you joking with, tokin' potent with
Tag team and strokin' chicks, the ones that do some bogus shit
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus
Naw, I'm on your block with Somali pirates

[Outro]
For real man Statik man, Whats good?
Yeah you know I gets it on
I ain't playin', i'm truly the worst
I was born about that

…Represent me[Verse 1: Mos Def]
For sinners, saints and scramblers and gamblers
And dirty money handlers, dignitaries and champions, narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and racketeers
Stars of stage, page and cameras, slang swingers and swaggerers
Double barrels and Derringers, automatics and miracles
Europe Asia and Africa, all the time in America
Atlantic, Ashland, Alblemarle to Albany
Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave, Bergen Street
Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave to Clarendon
Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress
And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct, Medina mastermind set
Ya can't lock my set now lock off, cool
Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
And the Sun, Moon & Stars, furthermore born knowledge go hard

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Strainin' to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowin' I'm sowin' them seeds
Let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it I mean it
And did it because I need it
Eat sleep it and bleed it
Write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement
Your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff, I lay them out like a Tempurpedic
Black Thought, I told you I'ma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from something that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it
Face it, I keep doing it well
Doin' it sans assistance
Is do it yourself, doin' it below the radar
We doin' it stealth, doing it again
For Illadelph and who else? But check it out
Y'all see him on a job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny
Swimming with them great whites now is where you'll find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me
I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining
Rock rolla bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
You're just hoping you don't get roped for your throat get choked anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with a switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you, mama
It's like I'm off the bombom when I bring the fuckin' drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fuckin' cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama, and Dalai Lama
So Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture
Of my genitalia with a note saying "bitch, I can't wait to nail ya"
Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya
That's him in the sheep's clothes; he just shaved his hair off Cecilia[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
Ay-yo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
That's the mathematical madness I'm on, the savage, the strong
The marriage, a bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on as if Picasso laced you
There's lotsa hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school, that's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Cable, slashing your facial
That's how a master degrades you
I'm battling Jesus if he passes through my label
I'm snatching his halo
God I'll trade you if send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizing
I'm only emphasizing
I'm still all about business and enterprising
I'm super lyrical, a brain boosts the chemicals
That's used up tentacles inside of my mental projectable

[Hook]
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm, I'm supposed to represent

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Black Thought the super lyricist, your arch-nemesis
Still with the Punisher, that's my accomplice
Stressing to emcees how they don't really want this
Electrifying shit his excellency Thought spit
These cats they sentimental such with a gentle touch
Dancing double dutch and all saying nothing much
My sound wave lifting your chin up like uppercuts
New found ways of ripping shit up, I de-ve-lop
Your squad chest swell up, still you're mini-ay-ture to me
Nature-ally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplating where the world traveler been since
The Roots bless you with a strong record, long like a epic
Immerse you in some 'ol next shit, ill poetic
Thought from Illadelph
Somethin' like nothing else
My talk stomp like elephants upon every elf, cause what

[Hook]
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
You will lose, I must break you
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm-I'm-I'm
I'm supposed to represent

[Verse 3: Big Punisher]
Ay-yo peace Roots east coast niggas repping the streets most
With heat, toast, and keep close more Phillies than Pete Rose
These those, niggas that'll lift your mentals
Lyrics'll twist your temples into pretzels
Like the Triumph instrumental

[Verse 4: Black Thought]
My instrumental's the Renaissance, no resem-ba-lance
To nothing you come across, lyrical holocaust
The crowd pleaser emcees freeze then catch seizure
They praise the Lord of rap thesis, true believers

[Verse 5: Big Punisher]
Just call me Baby Jesus cause lately niggas be praising me
Just for the way I blaze the beat crazily, tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavery
Gaze into my rhymes that basically hypnotize you occasionally

[Verse 6: Black Thought]
Occasionally as I focus on my next opus
The way it's all fucked up and emcees is hopeless
I leave your head wrecked as I erect sculptures
My thought's just a fortress, approach this ferocious up-closeness

[Hook]
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm-I'm-I'm I'm supposed to represent
Lyrically...It's suicide
Lyrically...You've seen him, you know how strong he is
Lyrically...You can't win
Lyrically...It's suicide
Lyrically...You've seen him, you know how strong he is
Lyrically...You can't win
Lyrically...You can't win
Lyrically...You will lose
Lyrically...I must break you
Ly-ly-ly-lyrically[Hook: John Legend]
There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, "Good luck"
You say, "Don't give up"
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul start to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes
In the tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize
I realise I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart
I'm inspired by the challenge
That I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake

[Hook]

[Outro: John Legend]
Ohhhh, the fire, inside you[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running round town spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence
Even if I’m going to hell I’m gonna make an entrance
Yeah let em know I’m getting cheese like omeletes is
But I’m the toast of the town like Thomas is

[Hook: Bilal]
We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying coldblooded hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn’t big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah that hindsight, 20/20, now niggas dead on the money
Trying to take something from me it’s a wrap like a mummy
Undun I am becoming and when he’s tired of running
Through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear cause they’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Greg Porn]
I’m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to break a gun law
Thinking that enough is enough but still I want more
Thinking of how I’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
By any means necessary, don’t give a damn
So every night I’m on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can’t win, can’t lose
Get 'em gassed, leave em leaking fuel
Either way the market moves
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now I’m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head
When I’m getting mine

[Hook][Intro: Greg Porn]
Lights, camera, chemical reaction
Attracted to a body of lies with fat asses
Thank the most high for the high of high fashion
My art of war is killer couture, denim assassin

[Verse 1: Greg Porn]
Am I a douchebag or just another doo-rag?
Tryna get ahead on some brand new-wave shit
For your entertainment money is the language
So every time I speak I’m tryna make another payment
I do ‘em dirty, sleep and get a dirt nap, that works
'Til my P.O. ask me where I work at
Think I woulda learned that sleeping in the bird trap
Living on the run like somebody tryna burn fat
I don’t give a fuck, now maybe that’s abstinence
Or the arrogance of someone who ain’t got shit
That think money over bitches is a stock tip…

[Hook: Modesty Lycan]
I live in a trap where things go crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin’ he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
I’m down to 95 dollars, that’s the extent of my riches
Out of 99 problems, 98 of ‘em is bitches
Out here hollerin' what’s ironic is
I’ve honestly been tryna do what’s right
But some jawn legs in the air tonight, like Phil Collins
I’m a sex-addicted introvert
Sucker for a pencil skirt
Looking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert
On my existential grind doing consequential dirt
Searchin’ for physical pleasure if I don’t go mental first
Molly poppin’, trolley hoppin’
Know somebody prolly watchin’
That ain’t stoppin’ me from coppin’ a feel
Karate choppin’ in this after-hours spot
Watching mommy body rockin’
First I feed her vodka shots then she eat my Johnnie Cochran
Livin’ fast, drinkin’ capt'
One of them hoes even had
The audacity ask me how long this thing would last
I said, “You wanna pay for class?
Get on that stage and shake your ass.”
She keep a dick in a box
And "in an emergency, break the glass"
I make her laugh
She makes it clap
And then she gives me lap dances and I’m thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at

[Hook][Produced by Statik Selektah]

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo it's the rap Scott Disick
Come through the fuckin' block with some hot lizards
Blowin' loud in the blizzard
Put 6 digits on the Wizards, shit, just don't tell my misses
Damn, she throw the dice with a red glove
Spread love, spread legs from the bed to the tub
Floor to the closet
Real sex on the Panasonic
I'm gettin' head in the pool, bitch
Bitch, I'm just better than you
Yeah, around the world like 4 times
All because a mothafucka spit raw rhymes
Yeah, more lines, more lines
Shit, feed 'em more lines and more lines
I won't dumb it down for morons
It's like shootin' big game with a small 9

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Bottom line of sellin' these pebbles
Get away with your life earnin's while I'm tryna dodge these devils
The whole squad Gucci, Jordans, but chances are
You in LV if you runnin' with these rebels
I'm sellin' wrapped up, capped up vials of crack
Every syllable and vowel is a fact, I throw stacks
The chick ridin' with me, she polished, she a dime
She stylish, check her HOEFAX, her mileage is back, she solid
The Desert Eagle here to better the people
Sellin' perico like there is no I or L in illegal
I hire felons, to sew up the streets, while I let you believe
That it's better to be you, baby, I call that threadin' the needle
You know me, it ain't nothin' corny in the wardrobe
I'm low key, even more so than Thor's bro
Impeccable ear, I take Braille, make it Morse Code
Then peddle it like I'm tryna make the course go

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
And you say New York City
My cheapest t-shirts cost me $450
Listen for me, the call of the wild is "Go Philly!"
It's shorties in the front row flashin' both titties
The texture of my voice is coarse, it's so gritty
That I could make the people revolt with no Diddy
I used to kick it with Hex Murda, Frank Nitty
In the D where he would bring J. Dilla and Dank with him
Riq Gees for mayor, a franchise player
Yeah, you might say I'm in the book of Isaiah
The highway is when it's my way
Yeah I'ma put a polka dot on your dome, and Kwamé yah
This is the big payoff, soliloquy of Chaos
Another rapper gon' get rocked like Amadeus
Defeat'll make a nigga get ghost like a seance
It's triple entendre, three stacks of, hey ya
I plan to keep a band like Fela
Until when my career's over like A.I
It's me and the Muhammads, Ali's, bay'ah
That never played the porch or asked for mother, may I
Listen, my callin' card ball hard like armadillos
Rappers too thin to win, like cigarillos
Shakin' their hair back and forth like Willow
But need to save the soft ass talkin' for the pillows
I had a issue with a hater, now it's kinda squashed
Like a slug below the soles of the St. Laurents
My response, a steppin' razor like I'm Father Tosh
Exotic fabrics on my blazer like the Maharaja
Sick whips in my garage, roll with no entourage
But I roll with heat like I'm Dwayne Wade, Lebron and Bosh
I keep the paper stacked in layers like baklavas
Even though they give us ours free, like the Amistad
I know I'm sort of pompous, no type of moral compass
Go right the fuck up in your mouth like I'm the orthodontist
Some rappers just startin' out, but me, I'm more accomplished
The imperial Black Thought from The Foreign Objects
I created a movement not just related to music
They keep askin' me what's my take on the state of the union
All these haters is human, but I'm a different breed
They be crazy cartoonish, but I'm in a different league
Killer colloquium, kush rolled with opium
Makin' my associates act so inappropriate
I got weapons manufactured in the Soviet
Now I'm like Future on that "I just won a trophy" shit
Ayo the, the, the boss is back
Take that, and while you're at it, make my coffee black
I tried to tell you mothafuckas on Respond/React
I'm the nastiest to do it, as a matter of fact
Yo who your top 5? Jay, Biggie, Pac, Nas
I ain't tryna hear another name if it's not mine
Any side talkin', I'ma consider it shots fired
At the outlier, and start it up like a hotwire[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Five thousand dollar coat shit
If you working hard for that dollar, holla "dope shit"
Or holla marijuana, heroin, and coke shit
For people that hustle did a snort and then smoke it
I came from a culprit to the pulpit
This cold shit is vintage and high voltage
I try to focus, how should I approach this?
I've decided I let 'em learn through osmosis
Double the doses, 63rd and [?]
You can form my swarm, like a hoard of locusts
I move certain drugs, opium and Persian rugs
I really only communicate with certain thugs
Such a wide variety of anxiety
Real muslims telling me 'Riq, that ain't piety
I'm still struggling to achieve sobriety
Before I wash my hands of things entirely

[Hook: STS]
I got them haters looking bad
I ain't do shit but pop my tag
I got them haters looking mad
And I know why, it's because I'm in my bad
Okay I'm swagged out, let's brag about this logo pull yo tag out
I'm swagged out, let's brag about this logo pull yo tag out
I'm swagged out, let's brag about this logo pull yo tag out
I'm a rockstar, like Smashmouth,  real niggas [?]

[Verse 2: STS]
Well hello motherfuckers, I told you you can't duck us
God damn I hate you niggas, all you niggas Uncle Ruckus
And yeah, this my introduction, hey schooly roll me something
Hell, I'm just gonna get high as fuck, cause they can't tell me nothing
[?] and I'm lost in, green thumb like Boston
Celtics like Rondo, my weed man'll come pronto
I kick shit, Tai Kwondo, told a bitch to call me Jondo
When I smash she ask if we'll meet again, I said honestly, I don't know
Ire' whiskey in my flask, Ralph and Ricky on my ass
I'm stuntin' on, you better pay attention, matter fact you can put it on my tab
[?] smoke like niggas but I eat like [?]
Told my niggas to play your role never know one day might win the Oscar
I'm all [?] I'm so gone, [?] I'm so thrown
Wonder what ain't no clone, be the kings of kings ain't no throne
We prolong this long enough, jam boy we strong enough
[?] napkin, go captain, [?] roll up

[Hook x2]Peace to the ancestors
Yes
Peace to Dr. Cornel West
Yes
Peace to The Movement
Yes

We came from the bottom
Ever since they got us
We've been going through these problems
400 years behind and there's no promise
That we could ever actually be equal, to be honest
It's messed up how they put us in chains
Kidnapped our language and changed our names
But when we speak ebonics then they call it a shame
They leave us with a couple options:
Rob us, slang
Now we locked up again
How much can our skin take
We went from slaves to inmates
Carrying the weight of the 50 states
Working your farms
Black nannies carrying white babies in their arms
Black men sacrificed their lives in your wars
But you don't ever show appreciation here at home
You treat us so damn wrong
You act like you hate my race
The police, they just beat in the streets, like a 808 base
America, when will you defend my case?
You never will 'cuz your freedom is fake
I'm only living here 'cuz I wanna get paid
Enough to round up all my family and shake

Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

They done torn...

(incomplete, I'm having trouble with the transcription)[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Let's toast to paid mortgages, lasting marriages
Tina Farris's pay King to Paris
Living long, making my kids heirs and heiresses
The family crest, the legacy, the heritage
I'm out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is
And we don't need Theraflu, we need therapists
Them never-ending pursuit of them dead presidents
Is the reason I got the band back together, bitch
Yeah, it's me and [???], and his [???]
North side, bomb squad, Eric Vietnam
If you don't see it like I see it then you see it wrong
We October 3rd niggas like me and Kwe'
Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly cause I live the kind of life art imitate

[Hook: Al Be Back]
That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But I'mma show you how it is
I'mma show you how we get in

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous
Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio
That's what a few believe like a doobie roll
We off of that Patrón, we sipping the Don Julio
You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth
That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off
The music that's creating a movement like it's December 4th
Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white
Animated like it's kind of darklit it's my wicked life
It imitate my life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
Yeah, y'all keeping it 3hunnid, we keeping it 360
Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me
Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left
Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle
Dare you to say you ain't a fan boo, roll a bamboo
Life imitating art imitating life, show you how the fam do

[Hook][Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Ain't no half-stepping
Bout to bring it to you
Bout to give it to you
Yo Talib Kweli in the place to be
You now rocking with the best BK MC
This is how we put it down O four

Kweli the great I be the first out this gate
I get cake stop that you making a mistake
I gives a fuck if the label can't get straight
I get paid with this mixtape like I flip weight
Yo, stay away from those state paid vacations
Nigga raw like Kane when he played Jason
From the generation of crack babies and aids patients
I go hard you niggas soft like Clay Aiken
Plus you only hard when the camera on
Soft like the foundation you standing on rhyme marathon
Sort of like when Diddy ran the city
Fuck with us and guns pop out like Janet's titty
Yo, I got niggas ready for the main event
That's why I'm still around and all those corny niggas came and went
Top shotter rocking with Trotter and got the Game on deck
Stroll through any hood and get the same respect

[Verse 2: Game]
Comptons Kool G Rap, black All Stars
10 khakis and a red Blue Jay hat
I’m lowridin' on 100 spoke daytons
Nigga with an attitude like Nas buying jewelry from Jacob
I’m don’t play that mixtape shit
Say my name and I buck 50 ya face like Miami Haitian
I’m gangsta homie, check my verse
I’m lyrically Big Daddy Kane in converse
And that Nigga [?] Boys N The Hood
And the city of angels got poisoned by Suge
I take the drama, roll it up in a swisher
Let Kweli hit it then lower the switches
I’m 3 wheelin’, through the Wilshire district
Thinking how Big and Pac both died by pistols
L.A. Times called it the Death Row conspiracy
Run up on my 6-4, i’ll take out ya misery


[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Straight out the frying pan into the game
If yall attention is paid no need to mention the name
I breathe the fire that can fire back drenching your brain
Velvet rope or gold chain its all a lynching the same
You in tuned to a world of pain
It hurt like new shoes with nothing to lose
The world to gain
To yall fools to brainiacs high iqs
If you feel it ain't banging than it's not my music
Can't stagnate the haters can't stop my movement
Play this at high volume and get you shocked off stupid
Ya kiddin me, here come the taste of  ?
Tell your people there will be something left to take with em
You see me lifting mics I be steady weightlifting
I'm zoning out silhouettes get to shapeshifting
Watch me force perpetrating like they ain't slippin
Kwa we about to hit em up catch another victim

[Outro: Xzibit]
Yea check this out
Let me tell yall niggas something about shit
Cuz motherfuckers try and do it to you everyday
Try and shit on you right?
Check this out
Don't shake the shit off
Cuz when you shake the shit off
You never know where the shit is going to land
Could land on your girl could land in your food could land on your car
Man, let the shit slide off you homey and hit the ground
Cuz when you shake it off you have no idea where it lands
Hehe a little public service announcement
From your boy X to the motherfucking Z
The left coast is the best coast, keep going yall
The best of Talib turn your fucking radio up[Verse 1: Mos Def]
For sinners, saints and scramblers and gamblers
And dirty money handlers, dignitaries and champions, narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and racketeers
Stars of stage, page and cameras, slang swingers and swaggerers
Double barrels and Derringers, automatics and miracles
Europe Asia and Africa, all the time in America
Atlantic, Ashland, Alblemarle to Albany
Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave, Bergen Street
Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave to Clarendon
Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress
And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct, Medina mastermind set
Ya can't lock my set now lock off, cool
Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
And the Sun, Moon & Stars, furthermore born knowledge go hard

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Strainin' to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowin' I'm sowin' them seeds
Let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it I mean it
And did it because I need it
Eat sleep it and bleed it
Write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement
Your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff, I lay them out like a Tempurpedic
Black Thought, I told you I'ma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from something that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it
Face it, I keep doing it well
Doin' it sans assistance
Is do it yourself, doin' it below the radar
We doin' it stealth, doing it again
For Illadelph and who else? But check it out
Y'all see him on a job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny
Swimming with them great whites now is where you'll find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me
I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining
Rock rolla bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
You're just hoping you don't get roped for your throat get choked anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with a switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you, mama
It's like I'm off the bombom when I bring the fuckin' drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fuckin' cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama, and Dalai Lama
So Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture
Of my genitalia with a note saying "bitch, I can't wait to nail ya"
Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya
That's him in the sheep's clothes; he just shaved his hair off Cecilia[Produced by Statik Selektah]

[Intro]
I want you to tell them
Statik Selektah

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Lets do this man for real
We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, reendorsed yards
Everybody four stars, Rae like forty, jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred Tecs flash
Flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buds ain't only in it for the tokens
Cause they say it's who you joking with, tokin' potent with
Tag team and strokin' chicks, the ones that do some bogus shit
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus
Naw, I'm on your block with Somali pirates

[Outro]
For real man Statik man, Whats good?
Yeah you know I gets it on
I ain't playin', i'm truly the worst
I was born about that

…Represent me[Intro]
Black Rock

[Verse 1: Dice Raw]
Yo, what's for breakfast?
Same as yesterday
Oh that's right cheeseburger and a 40 ounce
Hey, what's for dinner? Nothing nigga
But last night I had dreams of a porterhouse
Ay yo for real I feel like
Cattle in a slaughterhouse
But fuck that grow another here's a quarter ounce
It ain't no hydro, but it gets you high though
Them niggas look like cops what the fuck do I know

[Hook: Dice Raw]
At the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lights
Once you pay the price you can never do right
One thing I know all I did is wrong
Maybe there ain't nowhere I belong
The only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
They hoping one day that they find me dead
Until then I make a place in this world
For me and my baby girl
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Got the dead drop way until the A.M
Mumbo Jumbo niggas onomatopoeian
Call it how I see them ain't no rhyme or reason
I'm on some different bullshit everyday just like per diem
Out of bandwidth, animal anguish
So love no bitch, die rich as the language
Guilty as sin, depending on a reed shaking in the wind
Just a question never answered out here depending on its end

[Hook]


[Musical Outro][Intro]
Everybody get up, WOO!
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
If you can't hear what I'm trying to say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf
Maybe I'm going blind
Maybe I'm out of my mind

[Bridge]
Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a

[Hook]
Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

[Verse 2]
What do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for
You the hottest bitch in this place
I feel so lucky, you wanna hug me
What rhymes with hug me
Hey!

[Bridge]
Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Good girlfriends, I had a few
But the best girlfriend I ever had is you
I thank God for my blessings, it began with you
So I put a ring on it and I married you
Come on and take a ride with me on a avenue
If you see it and you want it, you can have it boo
You have these other girls getting mad at you
Cause you got brains, looks and attitude
Cause my skill line is getting blurrier
I come home to my own Miss America
I mean this ain’t no ordinary love
Go and bring it here to my girl, hurry up
I'm watching, I'm waiting and they not you, so they hating
They just angry cause you ain't basic
And I'mma give you a standing ovation

[Hook][Verse 1: Truck North]
I go numb on the beat no novacane
My cup runneth over, I guess I over came
Ask for my welcome, I guess I overstayed
I'm sorry, but it's comfy over here man
Now I got my feet up, cold I turn the heat up
Them hoes ain't fucking with these, they so b-cup
Here's another mule kick to your speakers
Give the drummer some - alright, that's enough
Get the truck and back it up, hate me now like I'm Puff
Good as gold, like I got the motherfucking Midas touch
Talk tough and get tossed in the [camel clutch?]
Now your ass split in half, like a whole dutch
Lord, save them from the murder and the mayhem
Riding in an old Lincoln, no Abraham
Putting rappers to sleep like I'm the Sandman
Top magician from the money making jam band
Bitches head-over-heels, like a handstand
They know North Side flyer than a flight plan
Higher than the light-pole, ya'll niggas tadpoles
Feeling froggy, then jump you you fucking asshole
Now look at what emerged from the catacomb
Turn your place of residence into a battle zone
[You suckers is old school, they so Battle Toads?]
Man, I'm keeping niggas' interest like a fucking loan

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yea, up steps the one and only
In the flesh, cynically Sierra-Leone
And fresh to death, big homie and them reps the best
You knew him from somewhere, you request the Quest-lover
Then his brother bring it on, sing a song
More brutal than Ghengis Khan, the name ring alarms
The face you couldn't place but you know I'm the truth
That's before you recognize that the one from the Roots
Is on to the [t?], take an eye for another eye
Let them hear gun fire for a lullaby
Motherfucker, who the hell am I
The Black Thought from the day that your life became nullified
Stuff of legend, so what the fucks tougher bredgren
When I'm a blast from the past, that started the present
Vision of the future, I'm with the super producer
And I'm ten times as smart as I used to be
I'm seeing the voice through the speakers
Porsche two-seaters, Jimmy Choo sneakers
Real rap remedy man, true genius
Brought Yosemite Sam, two heaters
To ask ya'll bastards, if there's any last words
Besides what, when and why and other adverbs
You going to be the next fugitive capture, fam
Keep thinking you can lie, and live after
Slow your roll play boy, rabbit ears
Cause damn right it's on sight, Vladimir
Cause in a blink of an eye, you will be out of there
Scrap gets smacked for acting so cavilier
South Philly, and them cowards don't travel there
Cannons let the heat rattle there, they don't battle there
Jokers will leave you in a pool like Mike Phelps
Learning to fight might help but it's light help
If certain bullets make flack melt
Then just imagine what it do to you, even if you a black belt
My street thugs be concealing where the gat held
In the hood where it used to be a lot of crack dealt

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
On LCD sound systems, trips to the museum
Can't believe what I'm seeing, but don't want to make a scene
Cape diem, Cold Medina, oh Selena just believe him
He's a whole 'other being, new war, North Korea, ug
Can't find [?] [?] onomatopoeia
Boom, boom pow, peace out, wouldn't wanna be ya
Black Eyed Pea ya while I [? common denominea?]
Abba de, abba da, kind of like Mama Mia
Sunny shit, so ideal, better sip that Sunny D up
Guard your grill, rob and kill, [?] when I re-up
This is it, little bitch, time to take you to the cleaners
Natalia vs Mila, who's the baddest ballerina?
I think I see [?]
Homicidal kind of guy [?] syrup
I'm in need of something sweeter, I've been eating all these bitter
Pitter patter, little rappers, ya'll ain't even half my palette
In my palace, 30 Rockin' like I'm Alec
Got to try and keep the balance Black Thought on Jimmy Fallon
With the Mavericks at the rally 'round the basket
Leaving Dallas on [?] Catalina De Morales
You ain't Alex Tribec so stop quizzing me
Shel Siverstein, The Giving Tree
Ya'll slithery slim balls just sick of me
I'm a city slicker, Billy Crystal when I spit a beat[Styles P]
I'm Black, been a greasy kid
I'm better off sayin nigga like Eazy did
Mike Vick bought a pit', now he goin to jail
He ain't have a license to shoot a dead duck or quail
Did the pigs have a license when they shot Sean Bell?
Now hell is a place we live
Cause the race we is, I mean race we are
Too cold for this cop to have our face on the car
It ain't candy so I don't want a taste of the bars
Ain't a ball game, I don't wanna sit at the court
Do a long bid, I don't wanna give that a +Thought+
But I'm +Black+ and people in jail is most my color
What up black cop? Every brother ain't no brother
I'm a have-not, grandma's grandma suffered
You just mad we hustled right out of the struggle
Let it rain nigga, we gon' dance out in the puddles
What?

[Hook: sample of Syl Johnson's "Is It Because I'm Black"]
Looking back over my false dreams that I once knew
Wondering why my dreams never came true
Something is holding me back, ohhh-ohhh
Is it because I'm Black? Yeah...

[Black Thought]
Uhh, yeah
They say payback's a motherfuckin nigga, that explains why I'm
Sick of gettin treated like a goddamn step-child
Livin like Assata, I'm an exile
Gotta climb out of my skin, just like a reptile
Born where the feds file, them suits and neckties
Operatin under the cold, live and let die
I'm tryin to break free of the hole
But five out of ten brothers gon' see a parole
Who this system fail with Mychal Bell, might as well be Sean
Fat cats picnickin on the White House lawn
And it's only ten percent in the hood, where health benefits
Genocide, Jena 6, guilty 'til we innocent
Citizens, listenin to government smooth talk
Take, one step forward and do the moonwalk
Back, give me the Peace Prize like Al Gore's
I got a mind like Malcolm X, how 'bout yours?
C'mon

[Hook]

[Styles P]
Struggle lives on and it tire on
Imus should've never been fired, just fired on
Not with a gun, hit him up with a water hose
Got some nerve to call a black man's daughter ho
Whoever put the nooses up, we oughta slaughter those
Klan in the precinct, where did the order go?
Klan in the schools too, where should my daughter go?
Where should my son go? Let me know what {?} is hung fo'
I'm too Black to not dream like Martin did
Die like Malcolm, a martyr to be part of it
Came from the ghetto, you know the heart of it
We just want it finished and, we ain't even started it

[Hook][Hook: Marisoul]
Cinco minutos con vos

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
It's ugly, it's ugly not
Honey in the rock, money in the pot
As it begins to simmer down, thickening the plot
It's hard to say if anyone was listening or not
Look at you and me and the devil, three's company
I'ma be below sea level, please come for me
Loving you is where it's at, look what you've done for me
If I told you 'you feel high,' then you'd jump for me right?
You catch more flies with sugar than you do with shit
A wise woman told me while clutching her crucifix
I don't really have an excuse for this elusiveness
I stole a moment of truth, mutual exclusiveness
Like water and grease, warfare and peace
To crave sweet revenge and find sweet release
In the thrill of a victory, agony of defeat
The man I was meant to be is passing me in the street
The dark horse marched forth going further off course
Nevermind, I lost mine when you lost yours
One life, one death, which will cost more?
Crawling on the parquet floor doing parkour
To be alarmed by the sounds of the foghorn
What I need is closure I'm getting my epilogue on
You're Mississippi God-damned but I'm dog-goned
You never miss a good thing until it's long gone

[Refrain I: Black Thought]
Brandishing the heater, suddenly I had this
Urge to reemerge just to brush away the ashes
Passive aggression, aggressively passive
Loading my weapon while I'm checking for your address
Crucible, crazy what the temperature can do to you
5 minutes left until the last dance, beautiful

[Hook]

[Hook: Elvis Costello]
I stood at the curb, trying not to disturb
The dark carnival crew
And a glittering voice far off there said
'rejoice as the casualties are but few'
Going to tell you now, before I forget myself
I could let you loose, but the key won't undo the lock
And the face of the clock seemed to merrily mock
These five minutes with you

[Verse II: Black Thought]
And when the clock strikes time comes to life
Slightest oversight cuts like a knife
Against my better judgement I had sacrificed
Very last chance encounter with my future wife
Searching for the love of christ, purchasing the merchandise
Lurching through the curtains trying to hide what I was hurting like
Pretty certain that some person gotta die tonight
And there's no hiding the truth in the guiding light
No confidential info, me llamo ensiamento
Who you call the angel of death is like my only kinfolk
My heavy bleeding heart is adding injury to insult
And I would gladly kill for just a five minute intro
Oh the felonious conduct of his holiness
Courting lil homie is less than ceremonious
Orchids, begonias, eyes like Appolonia's
Looking like she'd just seen a ghost like pretty Tony is
Miserable, invisible bully like the gooch
Better be continually and fully sniper proof
A hunter with a gun in his hoodie likes to shoot
For a moment I just sat by the door
Like the spook watching time tick
Counting down like a convict
Wishing that my trigger finger was non-responsive
Or that the overcoat that I donned was non-stick
Or that my mental wasn't this far beyond sick

[Refrain II: Black Thought]
Brandishing the heater, suddenly I had this
Fever was it me or either some sort of madness
Napoleon complex, his royal badness
Loading my weapon while I'm checking for your address
Stupido, half-man half-marsupial
Blood splattered cashmere afghan, beautiful

[Outro: Elvis Costello]
Five minutes with you[Verse 1: Black Milk]
King without a care, frownin' while the crown lay on they head
Crew recruitin' Huey Newton, chair sittin' here no despair
You was on a star chase, I was in a dark place
Lookin' for that glair
Lookin' for that light ahead
Days got dimmer starin' down that dark tunnel
Hopin' that you see a glimmer when them walls start crumblin'
Calls stop comin' in
People start mumblin'
Stomach start rumblin'
Need to hear applause and the fans call once again
Cab driver make a right, right up at the light
Destination, life
But stay here for a moment
I shouldn't be that long just keep the meter goin'
Keep the meter rollin' while I go in for a few
Left a song for the little one, tell him Dad cares
Wish I could've stayed longer, gotta pay this cab fare
But um, you hopin' better days'll come
Face to face with reality, no VH1
I sit back some, Watchin' my niggas that spark live
That's waitin' for sunraise to penetrate dark clouds

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
So I'm standin between vanity and foolish pride
On 7 Mile and Telegraph where the two collide
If I'm a man amongst kings and gods, who am I
For leavin' so many crucified or coup d'etatd
I'm from the D where everything is very do or die
My will to survive is what's separating you and I
My memoirs is revolutionary suicide
Now, who the realist nigga alive? Well you decide
This rusty .45 is never under-utilized
What goes down like a logo on a Puma Clyde, homicide
Probably on these loudmouth bumbaclots
Thinking it's cool to walk around not supervised
But fuck supervision, cuz you and you can get it
Lately I've been having premonitions of superstition
But if I stepped into the confessional, who would listen?
I need to change my ways, show me the new religion[Verse 1: Black Thought]
I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, going overboard like the Amistad
Ringing bells, it was 2012 back in 95
I made it out alive, now finally I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's sticking to it like, mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginners luck
If you denying the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial descent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I wasn't listening to that intuition now I'm in that system again
And I'm praying God give me the strength
I'm drifting into a dark place, tryna keep this part of my heart safe
My soul basically been shark bait, my body's in bad shape

[Hook: Talib]
Spitting that fire flame, on a higher plane, going poltergeist
Life a game, ain't no referee, I can't hold it right
Bring the rain, praying to the Lord for it to pour tonight
Bring the pain, fucking with that meth, I'm on that Walter White
There ain't no maybes, baby, make it or you don't make it
You gotta take it, take it, take it or you gon' get taken
Can I get a church from the congregation?
Can I get a church from the congregation?

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'm on that armageddon, public devastation, come in the Revelations
Rap Jehovah, knocking pastors over while I pass the dosha
Lord forgive him, but I keep cutting these records like a sword was with 'em
Mixing it with the medicine, attempting to warn the children
Of what the future holds, slaves of monatomic gold
Seems the problem is atomic, but it's microscopic though
I'm courting hoes and pouring fours, there must be something more than this
Hopefully I'm immortal and I'll never need a mortician
All my thoughts is black, Kweli on the track
My reflection is eternal even if the mirror cracks
And I don't wear no watch, cause I ain't got no time
Solar system, this is astronomy not a rhyme
We bringing the real back, y'all ain't have no spine
So spin the reel back, nigga press rewind
Soak it all in, that is until you're dry
I'm throwing the peace and eating a piece of devil's pie, I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Talib]
A dialectic
Attract cofollowings like scientologists reading the dianetics
This religion that I invented, it's really a way of life
These thoughts of freedom that I embedded is reaching you through the speakers
These poison animal leaders is weaker than niggas with fever and sweeter than diabetics
Get deaded trying to set it, they'll tie you up like a fetish
They'll gas you up like unleaded and let it off
'Til you wetter than spaghetti sauce and lettuce chopped up with your body left in a crevice
We the reverends performing exorcisms
Exercising the right to fight for the dedicated
Concentrated few that's left who listen
God is with them like we started a mission, following God is wisdom
God is risen like followers of Elijah finding God in prison
We praying for that work, we need that occupation
Can I get a church from the congregation
If you sick of the same conversation
You say you make it rain but that's just condensation

[Hook][Black Thought]
We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall, or just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

[Mos Def]
Runnin one on one and only hip-hop band
Yo Tariq (whassup) how your micraphone sound
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

[Black Thought]
We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

Well it's like smack the track up and leave dents in it
The vocalist, busting this blunt instrument spit
The magnificent, rappers run from it
All fly girls' nipples and toes numb from it
MC's in my circumference, is confronted son
Get your growth stunted from this, you don't want it
(What nigga?) The Black Thought and M-O-S Def done it
Who the ultimate? Yo my man speak upon it

[Mos Def]
Aiyyo I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane, barking big game and get hunted
Eyewitness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th

[Black Thought]
You better get your rest cause the next day comin
Oh yes, and MC's they scared to say sum'tin
Stop frontin, I'm in the cut just onlookin
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken

[Mos Def]
Aiyyo, keep your tape rolling so you catch every bar
Of the Black Thought and the black man from Black Star
Illadelph and Vietnam we conference, accomplish
Even with stakes inclined, I get mine, regardless

[Black Thought]
Yo, a lot of Smurfette MC's carry purses
And rock uniforms that's made for nurses
I burst your verses, your words is worthless
Only touching surface, the FUCK's the purpose?

[Mos Def]
I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a BIG bounty stressin me
But tell 'em to hold off, they too short to measure me
Mos and Black Thought blast forth with the weaponry

[Both interwined]
Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

[Mos Def]
Yo Tariq (whassup) how your microphone sound?
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

[Both intertwined]
We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

[Mos Def]
Yeah, now check your stove top before you take a listen
And make sure beans don't burn in the kitchen
These gassed-up niggas just ain't fuel efficient
I play the winter breeze to choke hold your piston
(eh-eh-eh-eh) Now you niggas can't make pole position
Class E chassis can't hold the transmission
Crew pit useless, they got they tools missing
Watch me, Grand Prix, champy for wealth driven

[Black Thought]
Yo, you go one for my hustle (hustle)
Two to rock rhyme (two to rock rhyme)
From the muscle kid I'm one of the illest of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind
A lot of MC's said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they running down one of mine
Thought suffocating em with yet another stunning line
You dumb and blind kid, it's enlarged and underlined

[Mos Def]
What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggas is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
My vocals got texture, you just texturized
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised
Step into my zone get flown like fly
By the b-boy Lazarus who just won't die

[Black Thought]
Yo, me and Kamal and Leonard Hubbard, ?uestlove and Malik
We go back to dollar hoagies and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubbling
Me and Dante like Marvin, The Troublemen travelling
Give me the mic, we on that again
B-boy business, off the top acting and battling
Serving them cats that forgot
But don't get too close, because you might get shot

[Both interwined]
Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

[Mos Def]
Yo Tariq (whassup) how your microphone sound
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

[Both intertwined]
We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

We go blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Went from Do You Want More?!??!! to what you want now?

[Mos Def]
Yo Tariq (whassup) how your microphone sound
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

[Both intertwined]
We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

[Mos Def]
Say here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who got so much soul
They taking total control of the body and brain
Flying high in the sky, on a lyrical plane
It's just two bad brothers who will never quit
Mos Def and Tariq from the 2-1-5th
They rock beginning to end, on a spiritual blend
And everybody who forgot then baby tell em again
It's just me and Tariq, with Ahmir on the beat
The Roots crew baby yo we got to make it unique
We got the soul-shockinest, body-rockinest
Non-stoppinest, Fortified Live survive the apocalypse
Rhymes we say, the perfect blend
Because we know how to rock when the beat come in
Like zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Zen zen-zen, ZEN zen zen ZEN zen zen
Zen zen, ZEN zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen, ZEN zen ZEN zen
Here we go, here we here we here we go
Zen zen-zen, ZEN zen zen ZEN zen zen
Zen zen, ZEN zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Let the poppers pop, and the breakers break
Then zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Zen zen, ZEN zen, zen-zen zen-zen... *fades*[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Well I'm a fly Philly nigga, finger on the trigga
MCs repent from sins, God's comin again
Original (what?), visionary individual
Original (what?), visionary individual
I proceed, as I give ya whatcha need
Like I'm a medical doctor, watch the damage
I inflict properly, ain't nobody risin on top of me
I be droppin more plot in my mic monopoly
Got to be, got to be reality, Stevie Wonder see
Black Thought be me, I groove ba-by
Or I clue they say baby
Would you get with this? Not even maybe
It's the mister gravy and shit
To explain what's goin on inside my brain
Is scandalous
No analyst can maintain or handle this...
Mind train, yo
I'm on some old snap a rapper neck shit
You know what I'm sayin?
So niggas best get out of my path
Kid, I'm on point like a gat
The basket case, I waste MCs with rapture taste
Facing these leads to cats diminished
They be pullin the mic out that ass when I get finished
Administrative assistant I'm not, yo, I'm the principal
Nigga, takin shots, like I'm invincible
Figure me to be hardcore, my input cuts your jaw
For real, for sure, do you want more?!!!??!

"I'ma get deep like Jacques Cousteau"
"Jacques Cousteau could never get this low, ahh" - ODB (3X)
"And I'mma get mad deep like a threat!"

[Verse 1 - Black Thought]
No where to go when I be flowing, try to flow and then before
Back in the day when I was cool, I couldn't afford to be a guru
On ya case like your lawyer, think you run, you mistaken
Put all records to the side, and it's ya face I'm fuckin' breaking
Awaken and await, and changin' shape like amoebas
I'm rollin' with stolen Tim, get slapped, match with adidas
We just wreckin', what the fuck was you expectin' from a minor
Put a bullet through ya chest, and see who next in line behind ya
Straight up and down, ya'll have a sermon and blew it
I have niggas wildin', as if they smoked' a gallon of embalmin' fluid
Grilling, want to be flipped like some shrimp on the barbie
I do my dirt up in Philly, chill in the hills of Upper Darby
Niggas that's rolling through my hood like a trooper
Comin' in with this other pussy, I smoke ya then reduce ya
Crucify ya, I fucked Elvira, now I'mma fuckin' shoot ya
My bone is hard as stone, cause I got blowjob from Medusa

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The beat addict, I'm crushin' MC's who cause static
Pen hits the pad, I touch stars in the attic
The dopest that wrote this, when suckas provoke this
Now it's the time for perpetrators to quote this
Rhyme that I wrote for heads to get loose to
I blow up spots like snots in a tissue
I dissed you, dismissed you, but suckas persist to
Bite my flow, so now you know --
That when I rip up a set, I get mad deep
Don't sleep, or you and ya whole crew can get beat
As I'm waxin', taxin', a dope reaction
Bitches who front, get reduced like fractions
So ya motherfuckers flex to vex, who's next in line
To recline, and steal my rhyme for check
Now the man ya facin', ya rhymes I'm erasin'
If you trip or get slick, I convict like Perry Mason

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3 - Jus Allah]
Meet ya makers, ya fakers and imitators
I'm greater because I do my best work on paper
Mad raps, raps the disaster from the masters
Snatchin' up rappers, and takin' out actors
MC's can test, skippin' yet, don't pass the limit
You finished, so save the Die Hard image for Bruce Willis
Ya raps are a joke, but I put dope from start
Transform with the art, rippin' ya fuckin' mics apart
This is the rawest of words you've ever heard
My rap style superb, kicking nerds to the curb
It can't compete with the man when I freak it
The crew will get beat quick, so stay in ya seat bitch
Rhymes I wreck or perfect, and correct lyrically
Too complex, fo' ya punks to step
Yo, I be rhymin' hits whenever it's time to flip quick
A writer's block non-stop, and I'mma get --

[Hook][Kweli talking]
Yeah
Yeah! That's what I'm talkin about!
Let's do it... Kanye West, c'mon turn me up and
Black Thought, c'mon turn me up and
Pharoahe Monch, c'mon turn me up and
Talib Kweli in the house with

[Hook: Kanye West]
Guerrilla Monsoon rap - all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat

[Black Thought]
Yo, I hit these emcees with the grip of death like I was a Vulcan
Ain't a lot of "ifs" an "ands", it's just straight talkin
It's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
Bitin off more than you can chew, create orphans
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin nails into they own coffins (c'mon)
Hear come the Dundee moves rocket-launchin (yeah)
Black Thought, quit playin him close and back up off him

[Talib Kweli]
Kweli -- spruce to the tree, Bruce to the Lee
Favorite emcee, that your favorite rapper used to be
One by one I knock 'em out like Schoolly D - my rhymes is eulogy
A flea could move a tree, before ya think ya movin me
I black and blue emcees - actin new to me, get smacked stupidly
That lack skills, like the black community lack unity (uh)
Still my rhymes hurt like Ali to Fraiz'
Step off the stage to shouts of "Kweli boomayyay!!"

[Pharoahe Monch]
See these four emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game, change ya whole sound
Nigga YOU, got ta, understand the plot ta
Movin and groovin and always improvin alot-ta
I'll outfox the, average Porsche Boxster talk
Break the bank on some old Frank Sinatra (New York...)
Slash Chi-Town, slash Philly
Check the blast from Geneva, you can get slapped silly

[Hook]

[Black Thought]
Okay... my sound drenches, each of the five senses
And hold the shock value of electrified fences
It's truth or consequences, ride wit us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
I'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf
Nan nigga competition, gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission, gettin Pharoahe for help

[Talib Kweli]
From natives walkin the Trail of Tears to players sippin Belvedere
We always comin well prepared, and all my dogs' smellin fear
PLUS, even my niggas from the Bay, they say you hella scared
Truth or consequences, and all senses be well-aware
Your style - under-developed there, hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see, but I can tell by your stare
Nigga you fugazi, sayin ya crew blazin
Like sayin Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican, we makin

[Pharoahe Monch]
Guerrilla Monsoon rap, smell the fumes, get in tune wit it
When I attack your city, y'all gon' think Dr. Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seed-spittin contests
With a vendetta that sent a betta letter bomb to Congress
I'm pissed - cumulus clouds of ominous
Words of the Thor, the rawness that'll restore ya calmness
Unless, you wanna be leg and armless
That's parapaleg' for those who believe in bomb threats

[Hook][Hook]
Stories 'bout the angels of brotherly love
This is for the sisters and brothers we love "Come on"
We care enough to give it uncut, straight up
With no chaser cause time don't wait up
Thats why we're sending cats back to the lab "Worldwide"
The microphone's up for grabs
Thats why we're sending cats back to the lab "Evidence"
The microphone's up for grabs

[Evidence]
Yo
Hunters and gatherers, Nomads in Attica
Radical Terrorists and those who tally up the data
What matters most is they can boast
But scatter when toast is close
Burners pressed to your throat you ghost
Of course
You could chose to go against the force
I'll fire straight ahead
There'll be no mission abort
We can take it to the streets or take it to court
Supreme shit get hit over your fort, open the door
We've opened up for different artists on tour
Sixty percent love, Forty percent war
Let's settle the score
Most things are rot at the core
Not what they seem
Watch the two worlds you're stuck in between
Or pay the penalty
Zero strikes, Zero Felonies
Lay low hakido master
Redirecting energy
I use words similar but none sound fresher than
"Three of us who rap together"

[Hook]

[Rakaa (Iriscience)]
Aiiyo you could probably find Rakaa at De Rokerij
Puffin' AK, sippin cafe au lait
In Amsterdam chillin in the cafe all day
Bang my shit between classes in your school hallways
You're fuckin' with expansion all-access
Hard journeys make you treat your mic like a cactus
Rap iconoclast that loves to sound flash
And sticky green grass with orange and brown hash
Take your tape up and take this on
I heard anything that does not kill will make strong
And I build one of the sickest holding this still
You need a dose of eccinacea with a little golden seal
If you boots turn up my two boots
Babu slice and dice your crew and produce hits
Misunderstandings go back to the blues but ah-
There ain't nothing like hip hop music

[Black Thought]
Live everyday like its your last
Cause one day ??you'd fight??, my nigga
Fuck around son it might be tonight cause figure
The likeliness of you surviving this brawl is slim
It's like scuba diving with no oxygen
Monster when I situate my slang
Leave a nigga almost brainless once and bang
Had a crowd screamin bout how they don't want your thang
Keep it the sharpest one in the game its no secret
My style is certified , Philly-Animal rough
Runnin' things, pull more strings than gamble and huff
Cannibal hustlers taught me how to handle myself
Hit man for hire pull a hot pick from shelf and spark
The pioneer to represent illadelph is Thought
I got these weak niggas pullin theyselves apart
Y'all know the tone the one that hold the throne
That radiate your dome like a motorola phone nigga*echoes*

Dilated*echoes*

"From the angels of cali to illadelph crack build"
"Hard Hitters"(Do it right.)

Chorus
Pull out the hardware
Let's do it right (right.)

Aiyyo, do it right y'all
Here we go, check it out
Subzero, cold from the Krush intro
The temperature alone shatter weatherproof window
We move at adrenaline rush tempo
And leave y'all rappers screamin' about
Who stepped on toes and cut ya throat
So what, you can't fuck wit though
You know it's me and that poetry to add injury to insult
When Thought begin
The what and the when
The why and the when
A be explained
Music ease the pain
Seize the brain
The flow's like sex in the rain
Hit 'em like they hit the projects wit the crane
Hit 'em like they hit the black man wit the blame
Hit the people like I'm bustin a gauge wit good aim
Tell 'em bang this, dangerous masterpiece
It's not a game to heat, pulsate through each vein
Stimulate the ghetto, that's the reason 'Riq came
It feel so surreal it's hard to keep sane
Unplug me, seems like it's raw, get ugly
I come to operate, just shine the spotlight on me
Just make a little noise if the crowd love me
The way I do it make these other rappers sound funny

Chorus (2x)

Do it right y'all
Yo, do it right y'all
Yo it's like wassup, everybody wanna get nice
But everything come at a price
It's like everybody got they own vice, mine weed and the mic
And women that I need in my life
Some strung out on religion and believing in christ
Next man need the money, stay pullin a heist
While this other wanna fiend, stay huffin the pipe
While this next wanna fiend, stay fuckin ya wife
Try to give the youth advice, and guiding light
Young boys in the street getting high tonight
Young brothers upstate hype, tryin to fight
Real bitter cause they niggas ain't fly my kite
What I do is for them chain cigarette smoke heads wit bad nerves
Old men in the barbershop using bad words
For people in the darkness, unseen and heard, for HIP-HOP
Don't get the meanin slurred
My flow disturbed
Presence is the most preferred
I descend upon Japan in a (?glowing bird?)
Talk hustle, about 4 million served
Still swerve, directing y'all, life spills, word jus

Chorus (2x)

Do it right y'all
Yo, do it right y'all
Aiyyo, when the fifth come thru it's like amazing grace
Slow motion like you in some shit that may have been laced
Standoff at the door when I step in the place
It's like the law comin' try and pepper spray in your face
If you a weak nigga stay in ya place
My name 'Riq, when I speak
Thoughts travel at alarming rates
Come on, stomp wit The Roots
I step into the vocal booth
Armed to the tooth
Cause the people want truth
We all want clothing and food, and wanna root
So I stand up say what I say in front of you
Comin thru, feelin something new, chill for a few
I know you probably wanna keep it real for ya crew
So pull out the hardware, do what you tryin to do
So I can grab the mic, and do what I'm dyin to do
The turntableist, Krush on the 1 and 2
And it ain't no need to tell you my name, you know 'Riq jus

Chorus (3x)[Verse: Black Thought]
Lend me an extendable ear, then another ear
Hit the Three Broomsticks, get me a Butterbeer
And I'mma tell ya bout a half-blood wizard boy
This kid Harry Potter from the house of Gryffindor
Magical young man from the badlands
On the run from the Prisoner of Azkaban
'Ey, Hermione was like his best friend
And his homeboy Ron was his right hand
When students at the school started turning petrified
Harry and the squad knew the way to rectify it
Magic wand golden child on the special side
Play a quick game of Quidditch as an exercise
Harry was humble more in the presence of Dumbledore
But mention Voldemort and it makes him wanna rumble more
In Diagon Alley, on a Universal Tour
See you on the Hogwarts Express -- all abooooard!
