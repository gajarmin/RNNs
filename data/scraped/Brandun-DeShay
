[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Introducin' Chance the Ruthless
Trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid
Loosely based on music
Swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of illusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended
Last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy
(Ha ha ha) Shut up

[Hook]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Acid, Acid, get it? Acid
Melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper
If this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack
Lickety-split, Look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back
Give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra
I eat it like Idi Amin, ya kna wha' mean
Hit me back when that mean shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Introducin', It’s Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
3 Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh
I rep the East Coast, I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer (Get to the chopper!)
I splash summer like a fast brother
With a number on his back, ain’t no fumblin', in fact, I’m -
Back, acid in my hat
Shoot then pass the gat, it's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef’s salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn’t help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on

[Outro]
Suck my motherfucking dick, it's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me[Produced by brandUn DeShay]

[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
I'm on my XXL Freshman shit [laughs]
These folks know what I'm smoking on
And a nigga smoking on that strong
My niggas smoke so long we like Cheech and Chong nigga
In these bars tell me one thing we do wrong nigga
CJ, you ugly nigga
Dessy not eating nigga
This nigga ugly nigga
I'm high as shit doe

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
To blaze or not to blaze, that is the question
First day of school late, already in suspension
Shit, my principal a hater, man
Cause I'm a great debater and my principles are greater
Sorry hater, catch me later
No need to be loud and obnoxious
Know the loud in pockets ain't allowed
But I watched it open up my mind and my chakras
So my conscience could block this topic
So drop it
I'mma make my way to first class
Got to keep a blunt though, I always pass
Seen hunnies in the hallway pass
They all got class
So they get high grades for ass
Gas, got it in the bag
Something serious
Know it's gonna last nigga
Fuck an eighth, period
We smoking every ounce til we permanently delirious
Sorry teachers with reefer
I can't take ya serious

[Hook]
Y'all went to high school
I went to school high
Y'all went to high school
I went to school high
Y'all went to high school
But I went to school high nigga
My empire burning on fire, learnin'

[Verse 2: Dyemond Lewis]
We see nothing with open eyes
I'm smoking lies
I vocalize just to close these riffs, these broken tides
Oh my, he's over the skies
I'm so high
Feel like heaven is mine
Don't blow my h-i-g-h
T-H-C, don't it feel great?
Feel like I'm living that dream state
Your purpose - are you a blessing or a curse?
Curse these demons
I spit like furnace to ward them off
I walk this surface alone
Lone wolf, super slacker
Dyemond Lewis - yeah he a packer
Quite a punch when these rappers
Talk shit and try to act up
Master do this freely, See slacker
Don't hop on tracks unless I feel that they need me
See I need her
My knees be easy, been there before &
Temptation constantly tease me
Back in Murrow classrooms I got brain to get me past school
See, I went to school high
Cruiser in the morning to get me to where I'm going
But now the Era crew poppin'
But now we chop it up when we touring

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kirk Knight]
As I astro in the hallways of Brooklyn Coll-ahge
Is now an image of a pot head that's just about to
Blow when he hit the microphone man you gotta
Hear the rhymes and shots I lost in a sauce of pasta
My green thumb touch a leaf beyond a cigarillo
Put me in a coma for days, as a sleeping willow
I was never blind my nigga
I been open the window too much smoke whipping here
Like willow, mine is still on the pillow, shit, got damn
Just to think, Hot 97 and there is still roaches all in my sink
As the clock tick, too much hours I'll be in glorious pink
And I was aware my nigga that's what I fuckin' did
We on the same page just to get a heading
And now I got my head in, and now I'm just ahead and
I never came in second, steady gettin' my blessings nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Nyck Caution]
Look, yo assertive with this herb that keep me turbulent
Curve a chick when I see this teacher who observing him
Mama bickering about my eight signs
Said if I keep my grades high, then I'm living safely
So I take five years to build a family
Nine to five is the grind, I'm trying eat
Man its always lunch time when I rhyme
Munster cheese, bankin' honor rollin' and my mind is out to think
But I'm in this damn seat with the teacher watching
I hear the speaker poppin', I think that they have found my skrilla
In this locker now they callin' up my mama and
My girl outside my motherfuckin' class with this drama
Like, "Jesse, I know you got a lot of things to do
But I wanna see you frequently and I don't really do
Like only me and you," bitch! I'm with my fuckin' crew
Do what I'mma fuckin' do, fuck a class and some loose leaf
Someone pass the doobie and I'm out
Life is but a movie

[Hook x2][Produced by brandUn DeShay]

[Hook: CJ Fly]
Who wanna cypher in the room tonight? grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright
Who wanna cypher in the room tonight? grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Said we were just a bunch of kids, like the Brady Bunch
Style so miscellanous, cats taking speed ain't in a lane with us
Favorite line of quotes/coats you can hang em up
You straight whats up, I don't know I wrote this statement cuz
It was stating just, how homie he was fakin tough
So I gave him lumps, beat him up, broke his jaw
He claimed he got jumped
Got on an orange suit it hurt to see my mans in cuffs
It goes to show how these Brooklyn streets were dangerous
Niggas ain't playin' son, come round here shining its the timing
When things get violent, eyelids violet, whenever they violate
That's why my style been to be silent
Unless they want the shaolin
I came into this game and ate with no one to make my plate
Said my grace, figured that they must not know what art is
Cause we just starvin' artists who become someone they all test
To them I'm just a target but I'm solid just like tar get, uh
I'm doing wonderfully you make these bitches want to flea

[Verse 2: Dyemond Lewis]
I be flippin' the bird to the public, I'm holding grudges
I'm always angry, and I dunno who to blame
So I blame the government, you gotta love it
Another youngin' that sufferin' I told him to fuck the world
And made somethin' from nothing
Come and see how he come in the game like an intrusion
Who's him Deshay supply the beats so I bruise'em, oozin
Im losin' my self control, you niggas is lightweight
We times ten to four, and we bend the rules
They act like they dont know, who the Pro Era crew is?
Who Diamond Lou is, coming for they flesh we leave them left like nudist
And if you new to this you'd see I show you the ropes
Ill be your PE coach, you know you see this smoke
How you think I'm smashing records like the cd broke, See Dee
In the back of the stu catching a view of the environment
I over analyze shit entirely

[Verse 3: Ala Sole]
It be that young De Niro, get chicks like I get dinero
You scare hoes to the point they dont wanna get near yours
Bare flows pour'd over earlobes
Fo sure, I flow in air zones, I'm one in the same you bare clones
Coast to coastal, get mami's like I'm 'posed to, go postal when we oppose you, so don't pose dude
I approach fools with tools, leave em in cork screws
Then resume the cruise, my hand on the boob will bruise
When we interlude, she get nude for cash dough, and jewels
And I pursue, put my tube in her inner room (kaboom), Two open root chakras sex the best, so you know I get lots of
Fuck em and I duck em, never in my pivotal
Ima love Doc. given out my presciptionals
Its the principals, I'm the prince of cool, I love broads
But Im a young Don, so my nigga only get physical

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Dessy Hinds]
Now as the drum kick basses, break faces
And the vibe take you places, here comes a track that niggas couldn't be tracing
From the end of mind known to trickle down your inner spine
And make these non alcholic girls do a little wine
And in the midst of time, spittin rhymes was a trick of mine
From the effect of joints, minimize the squinted eyes
Never needed to be even to reasons
The only nigga only breathing from God
With a mental demon screamin in winter seasons
Had to reflect as the style comes correct
So it comes correct
Better than cum correct when Im done for sex
Better text the less
So the text got the message
When a nigga bring more down from his pores
Without a single blemish, let him embelish every
Letter for ever with this soliloquy, thus spittin are your suspitions, suspiciously
Come and cop the little weed, cause niggas got higher from
Single bigger beads and climb the single tree

[Verse 5: Nyck Caution]
Said I be thrown up on this plateau, mobbin with my capos
Its all about the booty like sparrow, get your arrows
Cause the bose know that the fuckin pros ho
Wait, sippin slow so, slow mo, seems to be our fate uh
Rhythm rhythm got me high as fuck
See my stock risen up, I be never findin trust
But I found myself through the light, eyes thrice
Jumped and got ups like delivery trucks, Im sick of
Cereal shmucks from the emperial clubs, offering lanerial love
Im treat it like a domino, and knock em down
I dont give a literal fuck
Your minerals suck, Im a lyrical stud
Uh, look, dont tell me what it really be
Cause all I see is indigo and symmetry endo road
I end your road, and if your learn your soul
Expect the death for sho

[Verse 6: Kirk Knight]
Eh yo lets go, analytically you can see through my energy
I been ascending, higher than my fuckin enemies
We all gods in our mind, body and soul
Dont get caught up in 360's or you will be sold
And I dont play that shit, PE be the BET
Cream of the crops circle, alienated
And I know thats my ultimatum, I know its bitter sweet
And word to the streets, its either you or me
And Ima fuckin eat, so check your co-sign before I Rocafella
But they dont touch the cheddar, cause they all know better
This is the fruit of my labors so watch the land grow through my eye lids
Centrifusing not confusing through in my intellect
And my Kundalini need my Melanin, so baby put the melon in
Or magnesium, you niggas tarnish, smell em
Your am radio active no fair

[Hook x2]

[Verse 7: ROKAMOUTH]
If they hop on the dick, make sure you protect it
Watch how you step, plenty shit you can step in
And no disrepectin if you ain't in your section
Better watch how you talk, you stalkin my bredrin
47 goons come cool with no prevention from the coolers of the dimensions
Just mention, that you let them bring the best of your ascension
Like last night I rode the train, just to vibe
As I stood between the cars spliff in a knot
Having visions of spittin these rhymes on the mic
As I open my eyes to see lies that they hide
On that 47 shit I climb and survive and been through these rhymes
Definin through times, line by line guidin all your right lines
To find your right vibe to get your hussle up and find your right grind
Find your right grind like

[Verse 8: Joey Badass]
I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
'Til I float like boats in the ocean for sure, I'm show
Boatin, slow pokes get slow poked over me
Just a kid, wait your kidding right? Nigga no joking
Too much commotion broke folk just won't stop
Talkin, can't play his cards right I just might poke em
Cause where Im from, hearts don't get broken they got stolen
Say the wrong sentence, nigga put a semi to your colon
Paws that like dog feet, spit it sicker than bone meat
Fuck the world in orgys until that world until that bitch bore me
My flow horny, my game nice, my style naughty
One eye low though, he'll figure that out shortly
I speak the truth and she knew this since birth
It's her nature to look like she newest to Earth, stupid
It don't take cupid, all it takes is cool kids
Some cats prey on pussy like cougars

[Verse 9: Capital STEEZ]
It all seems fictitous dreamin' with my team for the riches
They say to watch out, for the schemin' ass bitches
You better keep a lot of cream for them itches
I'm too vicious, in a stream full of fishes
So I move with the waters like my niggas that manuever with a quarters
I skimped the last order, so you can dueces if you want in
A few coronas got me seein' future my aura
Future I'm controlling with my mind and my myriads
If you talkin' shit then let me fly to the pyramids
She feel nasty when she swallow the little kids
That means we had a minor outer body experience
Sticks and stones can't break my bones
So I alone cones like 47 chromes
The synchronologist, know we in the zone
In the middle of space time so tell 'em hit my phone

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat, pro-abortion anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Where the black girls get their weaves back
Awesome I achieve that mini, blasting "You're a jerk"
In some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot
Bouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead
I like my girls smart, skinny
Kinda pop tart, when I bite into them red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem
With the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent
Blind fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed
That I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring
I'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew
Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you
Kill the jungle let the cats loose
You didn't see me here if someone ask you

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I want to feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer, in the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try and relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa

[Verse 3: brandUn Deshay]
I'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables
I'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals
Let's take them high like the decibels
So we get them high, get them high like cholesterol
In a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber
That's fat, who needs another producer?
Chica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo
Cause I ain't really care what the rest say
Type of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape
Best stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes
Best believe I'm leaving with more of those
And I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying until the verse end, FIN
Brandun Deshay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator
Odd Future, O.F. until, until from now until forever

[Alternate Verse 3: Mike G]
We grind, these niggas asking for some promo
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet
No less profit, fiened when we drop shit
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
It's that crack, give you something to sell
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell
And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
Everything that we call flight, living life
This is everything that we call hype
I'm everything that they call nice
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see
Top ranked, number one my son
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some
And stay focused on the women and you get less done
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one
Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high
How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly[Verse 1]
The Shakespeare of 16's, dipping my ink pen
Made a sculpture of me but my dick was too thin
Paint pictures of me but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging on the every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero cause my words give them pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for 'em
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave them all astonished, ride with the verbs
Make a grown man cry with strength of the words

[Hook]
Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pick-up
Make Sarah Palin deep-throat 'til she hiccup
Had T.D. Jakes round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs

[Verse 2]
What's in the portfolio? Sicker than polio
Shit so personal, my mom can't listen to
Oh so original, nigga's extra-crispy
Bars so Bukowski, Soda Popinski
Little Macs could never be number one, your time's done
Bomb filling smelling like napalm, your day's gone
Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose
Maya Angelou abused child with her notebook
Spitting like Kipling with a tooth missing
Tongue bring torture to men, women and children
Memoir's sacred, hid in the basement
Await my next piece at a formal engagement
Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound
Start to get more power than the ones that wear crowns

[Hook][Verse 1]
This is anti-clean rap, nigga where the green at?
Risks I take you'd swear I had the balls the size of bean bags
Not what you're used to, bitch I rep the Bruiser
And the label Fool's Gold, jeans with medusas
Bitches wanna scoop us, get pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers cop clothes from the boosters
Hoes wanna choose up, of course they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist, also you need a tutor
These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas, that's what they made you
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fails
Cause they don't care about music, just first week sales

[Hook]
So they say you need a hit, a chart toppin' single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash crowd banger, play it all night long
You never get on, without a radio song
So this my radio song, this my radio song

[Verse 2]
She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thang on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'mma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Until it skeet skeet on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, cause bitch I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you're ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch I ain't Puffy
Ice cream paint job, semi with a hemi
Heavy duty Chevy, not a Beamer, Benz or Bentley
There's no originality, carbon copy singles
He made "Black and Yellow"? I'mma make "Black and Emo"
That's why these wack rappers, they never last long
Don't care about music, just radio songs

[Hook][Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Y'all is dead weight, less great, always getting second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dipping while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't Dicaprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwich's are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7" giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls want makeup, get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feeling like a hundred wars are going on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Acting like you fucking with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do, something that ain't tangible
Now I'm 'bout to hand it to the homie Michael Rocks, hear what he saying to you

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
Take a trip, took a molly out with Banco Populari
The word around the city is he sit in a Ferrari
I told myself I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party 'til my cardies get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her lock, then lost the key
Weed smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder then the Carter one
Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not saying it's coming soon, but I want the real show
Get me the treatment that you getting all the heels for
The shit they paying all the bills for
Man, I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for, by pictures
I'm feeling good, I'm peeling bills, I'm real as hell
I don't front, I roll blunts and papers
I don't fuck with fakers, your girl is asking me if I'mma take her
I'm straight though, you see, I'm booked up 'til April
That's mine, that's me, I take those, you tryna see some pesos
Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for
Stop acting like you can't go, you swagging to the ankles
I feel you baby, hopefully I look familiar maybe

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you will never ever get it because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holding the drugs
And you can never ever see her because

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land, and then the bags come
We walking on this planet seeking action
Break a girl's heart, sorry Miss Jackson

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Mac Miller]
And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top

[Outro: Mac Miller]
I'm so high, won't you think about that babe
On some other shit that tend to make me act crazy
15 thousand, blow it on clothes
6 in the morning, still sitting here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home[Intro]
High, hi-high
High, hi-high, ohhh
High, hi-high
High, hi-high,ohhh
(Can't get this shit open)

[Verse 1]
Pain reliever
Fever reducer
Ten to the head
Does that make me a loser?
I took nine shots of that fifth
Gone, gone, gone
Eight hits of that spliff
Gone I got
Seven reasons why I'm not sure of six things
On my mind and I'm comin' off this high five

[Hook]
Feel  me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

Second verse on my third beer
Kill all these voices that I feel I hear
Mob to the bride, I'm
Keeping the faith, I'm
Holding the fight, A
Hell of a night
It's a hell of a night
Ahhhhahhhhahhh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Only when I'm alone
Only when I was on one
(one one one one)
Live like I'm living today
Live like today was my last one
(one one one one)

[Bridge]
Falling from this high
(falling falling)
From this high
(one one one one)

[Hook]

[Outro]
All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real

All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real
(I know, But prefer my eyes low)Yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Ain't no nigga that's fresher I swear I do it better
Hit my beat man crack my travel
Been a broke nigga, man that shit won't settle
Been a broke nigga, man that shit won't settle
Tryin to feed that fam, hey
Been a broke nigga, man that shit won't settle

I got dreams that hidden a lot, whipping off the top
People ask me what I got, hold up I forgot
Young gas niga with a mind full of goals
You stay about mine I don't mind none of these hoes
I'mma get my regardless, knew what didn't started
If this was the way see, I would probably party
Young gas nigga but I'm tryin to get that chatter
So you ask me any question I would tell you who is better
Pitting the whip, taking the sip
Tryin to get some of these bitches to death
It's young true, man you know what it is
Came through the party and I handle my bus
Sipping on some going handle the ..
Appoint me what the camera it is
So I go shine like a motherfuckin light
Tell them hoes seat down when I handle my buss

2 x Hook:
Ain't no nigga that's fresher I swear I do it better
Hit my beat man crack my travel
Been a broke nigga, man that shit won't settle
Been a broke nigga, man that shit won't settle

Hey, tell me when you wake up in the morning
Easy dollars get it from my father so I had to pop my color
Green like some colors, you ain't fresh don't even bother
My whole fucking life I had to wonder and re-powder
But I'm still here on my grind, why this feel wasting your time
Money is all on my mind and my bick is here on my side
Watch me get inside, Michael Jackson I'mma just lie
Hit high knows like Banjo, she Bonnie I'm her Clyde
But that's just a story, I've been fresh till this morning
I'm so high and I'm yawn it, came down in this storm in
And my bitch keep on calling me, I got dreams to rock for it
I just fuck till it's foreign, kill a piece got a car

[2 x Hook:]

That shit was tight
I follow that shit
Hey, ..
Hey, most dope

You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do, something that ain't tangible
Now I'm 'bout to hand it to the homie Michael Rocks, hear what he saying to you

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
Take a trip, took a molly out with Banco Populari
The word around the city is he sit in a Ferrari
I told myself I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party 'til my cardies get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her lock, then lost the key
Weed smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder then the Carter one
Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not saying it's coming soon, but I want the real show
Get me the treatment that you getting all the heels for
The shit they paying all the bills for
Man, I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for, by pictures
I'm feeling good, I'm peeling bills, I'm real as hell
I don't front, I roll blunts and papers
I don't fuck with fakers, your girl is asking me if I'mma take her
I'm straight though, you see, I'm booked up 'til April
That's mine, that's me, I take those, you tryna see some pesos
Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for
Stop acting like you can't go, you swagging to the ankles
I feel you baby, hopefully I look familiar maybe

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you will never ever get it because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holding the drugs
And you can never ever see her because

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land, and then the bags come
We walking on this planet seeking action
Break a girl's heart, sorry Miss Jackson

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Mac Miller]
And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top

[Outro: Mac Miller]
I'm so high, won't you think about that babe
On some other shit that tend to make me act crazy
15 thousand, blow it on clothes
6 in the morning, still sitting here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home[Intro]
This nigga Korey said dropping jewels like the chain broke, nahmsayin'.That's all I really wanna do

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
I had a lot of role models, old niggas, doctors, dope dealers
It's funny cause it was the same thing to me
Cause money was the main thing we was trained to reach
Same thing they get paid a month, mothafucka I get paid a week
And I done had all kind of hoes, different girls from A to Z
My car is switching every day of the week, Yours can't get you from A to B
Without breaking down, locking up, I don't know no hoes that I can trust
That Polo on, on Nautica, selling the phones was not enough
Roll the dice until we out of luck
Because coming from the bottom to the top is rough
The government be giving not a fuck
And neither should you, you got a crew and your crew is tough
Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each other's crutch
You lean on me, I lean on you, nigga I hold you up
Toothpick Clique or bust your head with a brick
Girl, I see you on top of me, just ride it like a jockey
She soaking wet, musta not known who you was stroking with
The coldest sex from the twenty-something, sort of older vets

[Hook: Brandun & Michael]
A wise old soul once told me "son come ask me what you wanna know"
These words won't last, this lifestyle's bad, this piece of mind the antidote
Gotta get that paper doe, gotta get that paper doe
Gotta get that paper doe, gotta get that paper
The world won't end, it's still gon' spin, some niggas will but we won't
Cause see I care, I wanna share, with you my mind the antidote
Gotta get that paper doe, gotta get that paper doe
Gotta get that paper doe, gotta get that paper

[Verse 2: Michael]
We be the lords, god, get a picture of him baby
In that Porsche Boxster, driving like he crazy
We be the lords, got hoes wanna have his baby
So of course I'm, smashing on the daily
And I got bands on top of bands, popping molly with my white friends
Sip a Tropicana, OJ and I'm okay
Now that AC feeling crazy coming up out of them vents
Dark shades, they be adding that tint, whole time we was tryna invent
While they bit, you can't prevent what's 'posed to happen, it's meant
Don't let me find out you sold your soul for the smallest percent
You sold your soul just for some gold and got a heart of cement
Oh yes, and we be kicking them hoes out that y'all kept
I'm keeping records of them plain broads y'all press
I guess this success is dependent on
Less of the stress, getting more of the women though
I'm gon' show you niggas how to progress and get along

[Hook][Intro]
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale, this here is the epic tale

[Prehook]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Verse 1]
I hear my thoughts, I hear them creep into my mind, into my dreams
Voices in my head save me, Untie my hands, untie my feet
So I might fly, so I might fly

[Hook 1]
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale

[Prehook]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Verse 2]
Like clouds under my feet I try not to think
Not to feel like I'm stuck in this space I'm just me
I'm just so much more, so much more, so much
I'm so much more, I feel I'm so much more
(Feel like I'm so much more)

[Bridge]
One day I’ll live to tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day if I live
One day if I live, I’ll tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day I’ll live
One day I'll live to tell the tale of my mind
One day, one day I'll live to tell the tale
One day I'll live to tell the tale of my mind
One day, one day I'll live

[Prehook]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Hook 2]
Ill be, I'll be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your side
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your


[Outro]
Lost my mind, can't seem to find it but I'll be here
But I'll be here though[Intro]
Tostitos are the shit

[Verse 1]
I'd rather die than, be your slave
Slit my wrist wide and take this stage
Wipe blood out my eyes and
You jus' lay, there
You think I'm crazy, . . I am

[Hook]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack (I do)
I love you like I like to get high (I do)
I love you like I love Crack-Crack (I do)
I love you like I like to get high

[Verse 2]
I'm just a unicorn
Come catch me
Strip me in chains until I bleed
You know I like it
That's why should I stay here
Why should I fight it?
I won't, (I won't)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Drove in from my small town
Lookin' for some action
Thought I could curb the crazy
But I can't
I just crave the pain boy
I just love the thrill

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'd do for you
Anything
I'd do anything[Hook]

[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]
Yo, while I daydreamed I came across a matrix glitch
Red pill or blue pill my conscious can't play with this
Took the red pill my world turned like a dreidel spin
I'm soon to blow up like yamcha versus the saibamen
I continue on this journey
I'm feeling like an alien round a bunch of Sigourneys
My future looking radiant, lately I'm feeling earthly
I feel that some hate me, debating, they not certain
I gotta couple dreams and I have a couple hopes
A double self esteem and some fans that say I'm dope
I started as a seed and I'm glad they see my growth
And the ones that doubted me is the ones that say we close
Yo people don't understand just blame your medulla
Labeled a loser made fun of cause I'm not a user
People on that bullshit but far from Carlos Boozer
The only one awake around these snoozers so I just

[Hook]

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Uh, I wake up from my slumber, mind on wonder
Beautiful broad under my arm bright as summer
She coming close to a she wakes
Sun peeks through my window
Penthouse views, some louboutin house shoes I slip in em
Then slip out, routine then I dip out
Garage full of cars like a dealership I pick out
That iroc-z t-top like the dinosaur
My iphone beeps girl text me her vaginasaur
Wow, backin out manhattan streets full of peeps
Actin wild, fans packin, beats slappin, we stackin billboard hits
World famous on that top 10 countdown
Hot 97 really boutta get hot now
When grammys come around boutta have that on lock down
If he wasn't before shit well 2Pac back now
I lie down in my PJ seat right about now my alarm clock beeps
I been...

[Hook][Verse 1]
Everybody play your part from the start in this game if you role play
Stickin' with your team you can be a king
More cake for the whole squad
The butter soft leathers in the Dodge
Viper with those headlight wipers
I don't need no change
Go pay the tab at the bar and come back with some of that dang Rose
You need a coach I'm Cus D'Amato
And if you ain't got no cup don't touch that bottle
She knowin' that she fly too
And I can't say bye to them thighs no matter how fuckin' hard I try to
She got a new boyfriend but we still sexin'
She don't call me as much but we still texin'
My shawty with the bubble butt
Butterflies bubble up in yo' gut
Fuck the rules lets make some moves
Its true I could try somethin' new
But I'm slidin' with my ex maid
Lets jet baby

[Hook:2X]
Ay baby
I see you just can't quit
I see you got a new nigga
But he just don't fit
So I said

[Verse 2]
Now you lyin' to your friends pretendin' we don't speak
Promised your man we was done we was over
You run to come over to the crib when you leave the club
You still got that wristband on your left hand
Right bricks, bracelets, yes ma'am lets jam
Like the printer when you overload it
And don't I go to work on that ass like I'm tryna get promoted
Ridin' in the Lotus
Friday I notice you the coldest
A Coca-Cola ain't poppin' quite like you are
Lite Brites in the brake lights, new car
I'mma watch it like Zeitgeist
I should've been cut you off but I keep slippin'
My homie had the same story but it seemed different
Its supposed to be me or you this time that slip
Shit maybe not this round
I learned my lesson baby next time around

[Hook][Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Today was a good day
When I say you bad, girl, I mean that in a good way
The winner is yours truly
I will be ready 'fore they giving awards to me
Congratulations, tell 'em that I'm on to the next one
Until I get a buzz like my phone when a text come
All my niggas in it, the music only reflects them
So I am doing deals until I got a couple to select from
Yeah, this on behalf of my team
And the green I got in my duffle bag from Supreme
And baby tell me that I don't be speaking it so it seem
Like I be thinkin' like I don't even know what y'all know a king
I'm in my own world, '94 Common shit
Don't compare me to niggas I have nothing in common wit'
I am the 2-3, the one drop a third
Homecoming, drinking tequila, no Mountain Dew

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
And I'mma do it right
On my spring break shit
Shoutout to the girls I'm kickin' it at the lake wit'
Red cup sippin', burnin' L's by the pool house
Even when it's back and I'm feelin' like school's out
And I'mma do my own thing
So may the best man win, nigga, may the best man win
And I bail the fuck out, then I woke up gone
And now I'm workin' 'til tonight, but I'mma do it again
Let's get it

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Well there's a lot of people that was hopin' we gettin' last
Summer school dropout, but yo, the weave didn't pass
Ask my teachers, had no sequels, I was sleepin' in class
Had to buy a trillion books for all the people that asked
If they could sign my shit, yearbook full of phone numbers
Well I be goin' through some paper like hole punchers
But I be savin' like Jesus 'til I make more
These niggas look but don't buy like a bake store
Work a bit, play more, sit a bit, pray more
Girls love how I lay it down, Claymore
Catch me playing Black Ops or watching Adventure Time
If this your time, I suggest you get a new watch
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to pussy
No matter how many magazines a nigga is in
When he get smacked with reality he'll wish we was friends
It's for the win

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Somebody tell 'em last part's the home base
I'm swingin' for the stands, 'bout to run in shit
Blowin' up, they say I'm the bomb on some hundred shit
Throwin' up the brainiac as if I couldn't stomach it
Give your girl a heat stroke, hotter than the summer get
I don't have to make 'em go, I got the shit they come to get
A Chicago McDonald's, I'm posted up in the front of it
Save money, nigga, get a Chase card
Double O, I'm ridin' on the track like a race car
See the way I'm puttin' words together like I ain't got a space bar
A Chicago world, I'm from the jungle where the apes are
Boy I said I'm comin' out swingin', set your guards up
Time for these candy-ass rappers to get their bars up
Kinda rockin' with it, my nigga, turnin' guitars up
Shootin' for the moon, a nigga wettin' the stars up
Shots fired, now I'm in it 'til the end
I'mma see 'em at the finish line, I'm going for the win

[Hook][Hook: brandUn DeShay]
I wanna be the best that I can be, right, right, right, right?
With God on my side, there's nothing that I can't see, right, right, right, right?
It was promised to me there's nothing that I can't be, right, right, right, right?
So until I become the best, baby, I can't flee, nah, uh-uh, nah, uh

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I told everybody don't doubt me
Now anybody still sleeping on me gonna have nightmares about me
They told me I'm no J and they said I wouldn't make it
I told them my flow was medicine, said they wouldn't take it
I gave them the cold flow and still they wasn't shaken
Niggas had hooded coats, I knew that they was fakin'
A bunch of Clay Aikens
But I got my kite in the sky, flyin' high like the new Ben Franklin
But, I'm frankly yours
I'm the moon and the sky if you try to shoot for
Like... ready, aim, fire
Bang, dang, every dream is assembly required
But I got a mind like [?], uh
If I build it then they will come, my day will come
Cause I can see colors in my music
I hope you see color when I use it

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
I wanna be the best that I can be, right, right, right, right?
With God on my side, there's nothing that I can't see, right, right, right, right?
It was promised to me that there was nothing that I can't be, right, right, right, right?
So until I become the best, I guess I can't leave, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
My future bright
While you haters flying kites, I'm stomping in my Nikes
With my shades on, fresh from the start
Until the day gone, Veggies just welcome haters back
Like that May song, I'm living in a fantasy, just flying off the canopy
Taking everything because there's nothing that they handed me
I'm ill, I feel what's real
And it's a cold life, just chill
Just freeze, just think
Things happen in half-seconds, so don't blink
We tagging the world up, we need mo' green
Mo' ink, mo' bars, mo' shows, mo' cars
Louie hanging, oh God, more haters, more "nah"s
More songs, good job, man we so odd
I pray that I live, homie, my faith in God
A few kisses at the bottom and more dates on the top
The more they hear my music and they more they on my jock
And time is money and it cost more than a watch, like

[Hook: Casey Veggies]MEGA RAN
I hope there's no epithets in my epitaph
Perpetually 20 minutes late I would get to class
Just in time for the second half
Usually asked about Black lives
And forced to speak on their behalf
I was the only speck of chocolate
In a big bowl of the opposite
Bout as far from the hood as I could get
They called it culture shock but I actually thought it was kinda sick
My roommate was a rich kid
He majored in golf, really golf--- he's making 6 figures
I learned a lotta valuable stuff
Like 151 is some powerful stuff
Tried to stay felicitous, wound up ridiculous
*Slovenly, idiot robbed of all my innocence
My credit is impotent, now I can't get rid of it
But looking back, yo i wouldn't change a bit of it

Chorus
When I had it
Couldn't stand it
Used to rush it
Now I want it
But it's gone now
Yeah it's gone now
It's all over
-- Or is it?
X2

SAMMUS
I stood out like an outie as a townie
Yeah I went to college in my county
It kinda got me down
Because the out-of-towners always tried to clown me
Talkin’ bout they problems with my town
Like I was present at the founding
Shooot I dreamt about when I could finally leave
Cuz in the Ivy league everybody tryna be
The next Zuckerberg, Gates, Jobs...
I prefer great times
Over my pay stubs
So I said bye to New York and Wall Street
But got bored and balls-deep
In my feelings about missing my porch and mom’s treats
Yeah the herbs is always greener on the other side
And it's the worst when you're a teen you think you gonna die
If you don't get what you want when you want it
You think you need a whip and apartment a gin and a tonic
The only thing you need is a team to convene and a screen with some Sonic, got it?Gimme that lighter, fam
Joint canoeing like summer camp
There's money at my front door, should I invite him in?
Yeah? Just let him chill, get him a glass of water?
Tell him I'm his biggest fan, number one supporter?

Verse 1:
Police orders to sweep the street corners, if you speak to chief, tell him the money we keep on us
It's all ours you don't get a cut, fuck you
Weren't supposed to make it this far but we snuck through
(flexin' on who?)
Nigga I can wreck ya whole crew especially when yo main nigga says it's just you
That presidential day date bezel like ooh
That yellow gold middle and I'm through
I do it so good that stoop kid will leave his stoop no essence of youth
Never been a goof, where the loot at though
You lookin' at me stupid, what you do that for?

Chorus:
We built it from the ground up, swingin' for the stands then we hit the mound up
Lookin' for the man, baby well you found us
Flyin' on my way home soon, flight first class like homeroom
(x2)

Now I used to feel the pressure, but now I'm just impressive
King size bed, couple thousand on the dresser
I'mma eat these weaklings with thousand island dressing
And I keep ignoring calls from the girls that you be pressing
Infatuation with money, a borderline obsession with the shh
I'm a jugernaut, Bubble Moncler, who the Dougiest?
A double knot, tied around my money who you fuckin' wit?
I love my whole family, tattoo of the grammy
When I first started flowin' thought they wouldn't understand me
I didn't wanna catch the criticism from the band geeks
Talkin' bout I'm off key, keep a big stick and tread softly
That's something that my old G taught me
Avirex leather that my grandma bought
Niggas tried to get it but they couldn't get it off me
So get off me
Tell ya girl to get off these

Chorus:
We built it from the ground up, swingin' for the stands when we hit the mound up
Lookin' for the man, baby well you found us
Flyin' on my way home soon, flight first class like homeroom
(x2)[Verse 1]
Bitch, I done had 'em all, had a ball
Took her by the hand and I grabbed her paw
Girlfriend left, wasn't mad at all
Rebound game like Pau Gasol
Only wear Gottier or YSL
If I ain't at home, you should try the cell
Nigga made the beat and the rhyme himself
Grind 'til sunrise, tired as hell
All kind of girls want the wifey crown
Nowadays drawing all types of crowds
Brand new swag, bitch, wipe me down
Picking up girls outta NikeTown
Lane Tech had all the baddest hoes
Took the Green Line towards Cottage Grove
Funny cuz my niggas, had a lot of flows
And I wasn't even rhyming, I had the hoes
Used to want it all and a bag of clothes
Lavish homes, baddest songs
Played the underground like the catacombs
Childhood, never really had it holmes
Back then, hangin round Steve and them
Runnin round, talkin' 'bout "she's a ten"
See the same hoes next week again
Wearing the same clothes that I seen them in
Used to get chased out of Humboldt Park
Fuckin' with the Latin hoes after dark
Bad little nigga, act dumb but smart
Hate to get in trouble, but it's fun to start
Chitown boy out in Brooklyn now
Karate chop samples, then took a bow
Arrogant asshole wit looks and style
Might have to try the modesty look, but now

[Hook]
I done had 'em all
Bitch, I done had 'em all
Bitch, I done had 'em all

[Verse 2]
Camo things, Army fatigue
Me and my team all reign supreme
Getting our dream, all major things
Give her that cream, ("It's Maybelline")
"Get to work, boy! You don't get paid to dream!"
I'm the bomb, bitch, ain't no disabling
They said what I'm doing was a crazy thing
But now a nigga really getting paid to dream
From a city where we all savages
Yeah, it sounds crazy, there's facts in this
Shit come easy like laxatives
Thick glasses to see past you nigs
Picked last man, I can't imagine this
Sick rapping, I put cash on this
Big dragon, I'm so passionate
Whiplashing from how fast I spit
Dope fashion, so don't ask for this
She want my gene pool just to splash in it
Feeling like a Hogwarts graduate
Cause every single whore wants the magic stick
I don't have to argue what classic is
I'm dope, you don't even know the half of it
Bulls snapback with the jacket zipped
Fuck a Dragon Ball, I wish?
My nigga, I done had 'em all

[Hook]Uhhmmm

[Verse 1]

I really wrote this song for the cool kids
I ain't signed to Fool's Gold, but this fool is rich
You niggas ass milk cause you with the bullshit
Dr. Armbruster thought I wouldn't pull shit
True shit , senior year
Pulling pranks , made it clear
That Ted runs shit
In between lunches
My lines pack punches
My name no introduction
I don't hold grunges
Making love to my blunt bitch
Roll it , light it
Now she getting excited
All I touch gold , King Midus
And I got no plaques gingivitis
You ain't got swag , I don't like it
This one of my old tracks , I'm just psychic
High from high hat , high from high kick
High all day, be on that hype shit
Hypebeast , Hypetrak
Waiting on my shit
With my nigga Gino
Throwing in a mosh pit
Heard Ted a rapper , but he never drop shit
Chilling in the air kinda like a drop kick
But be easy bro , be easy
Keep em in line like a pair Air Yeezy

[Hook]

In Orlando Fl, it's a really nice day
In my driveway , roll a really nice jay
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
It's a dream sipping lean , now I'm sitting sideways
With your shawtay , she'll have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
Ted Massena
Brandun Deshay
Kicking my feet up
Yeah that's all day

[Verse 2]

Loving weed getting high
Me and my guy
We like Bender and Fry
We be all up in the sky
Gotta pair Jeremy Scott
Cause a nigga supa fly
And the coupe look like a pie
Tan on the outside , red in the inside
Told your chick "get inside"
Than I cuff her... FBI
It's okay she'll be fine
And shine fine...
And it's fucking payday
Everybody know that weed is the gateway
Smoking in the safe way
Let the bong rip like a beyblade
And I'm like baby , babyyyy
Driving in the 45 , but I'm going 80!
Uhhmmm
I'm stunting and they hate it
Real shit though
She get low to Diplo
We bump it in the whip bro
And it's just a strip show
Where I'm at, it be live
Honeys know I'm buzzing in this beehive

[Hook]

In Orlando Fl, it's a really nice day
In my driveway , roll a really nice jay
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
It's a dream sipping lean , now I'm sitting sideways
With your shawtay , she'll have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
Ted Massena
Brandun Deshay
Kicking my feet up
Yeah that's all day

...

Really nice day
Have a really nice day
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
It's a dream sippin' lean now I'm sitting sideways
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
It's a dream sippin' lean now I'm sitting sideways
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day(Intro)

(Casey Veggies)
This is the story of a young man
Who dreams to understand
The whole world in his hands

(Verse 1)
Workin' hard tryin' to make it to the top rhymin'
Refrigerator empty had to eat the Top Ramen
I'm in L.A. where kids rock Diamond
That's to the homie Nick, what you do is damn sick
I be on my shit them dudes need to read the pamphlet
Tryin' to get a world, more than some little dances
We be in the wood nigga, you wouldn't even go there
Was a party by the forum, I went and did a show there
I ain't tryin' to act like its nothin' to make it
Ask the girls in my city, bet they mess with us baby
I just spit it from my heart, you ain't nothin' you fake it
Yeah I said it, you dread it like your mother's Jamaican
It's Young Veggies man, swear I made a couple of payments
To be the boss, hope the haters just love what I'm sayin'
To my city, that I know'll be happy I made it
And the rap fans that ain't to sure about Casey ya hear me screamin'

(Chorus 1)
I you love me than let me see it
Stop frontin' on me behind my back, and keepin' secrets
Hear me screamin', it was dark but now I'm beamin'
And I put it all in on my grind now you believe it
Hear me screamin', my vision was so scenic
And I added dedication and time, now you see me
Hear me screamin, you don't even know what you do to me, truthfully

(Verse 2)
You got me mad girl that I ain't even hit it yet
But I know you missin' when I used to get you wet
You used to do me wrong and I wouldn't even get upset
Cause when you gave me brain girl I swear you passed the test
Uh, in front of your friends you always tried to act
But I'm that immature kid that always had your back
We was in love, yeah girl I thought I met my match
But you always told me what I did wrong, what's up with that?
Yo act right, say we just friends but you was kissin' on me last night
I guess you can't resist me
I'm all in your head now you tryin' not to miss me
You goin' off to college, won't be able to assist me
I bet that kid that's your best friend be tryin' to diss me
What's that lame nigga purpose? That's the thing that always gets me
To the kind-hearted girl that so lost my history
So confused by our love, but be runnin' to get me, hear me screamin'

(Chorus 2)
Know you said it, but you ain't mean it
I was lookin' at you right in your eyes, but you ain't see it
Hear me screamin, we can't love if we keepin' secrets
And if what you got to give ain't real, that you can keep it
Hear me screamin', you got my number, you can keep it
And if you don't understand what I'm doing, then I'm leavin'
Hear me screamin, you don't even know what you do to me, truthfully

(Verse 3)
I know you love me grandma, you my star girl
You can't speak to me but I know who you are girl
You here livin' but its not you
If I could go back in time I swear that's somethin' I'd do
You the reason that I get done what I do
You my purpose, it wouldn't be me if there was no you
You was in that nursing home before '02
When I was young I couldn't believe it now its so true
It hurt my heart I won't be seeing you
But even more when I be in room 4C with you
I don't wanna see you like that, there's nothing we can do
But you been holdin' on, you so strong, I wanna be like you
I thought about you this evening too
I wanna put this whole verse through your feedin' tube
For my grandma layin' in bed, can't even eat her food
Love you so, wanna let you know that I see through you

(Outro)[Intro/Bridge]
Give me the fame(x7)
I want the fame(x7)
Give me the fame(x7)
I want the fame(x7)

[Hook]
Hollywood
Big old house, Range Rovers, Diamond Rings
If you like that kind of thing
Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I be that young rhyme slinger
Keeping it G funk like it's '93
?
Rocking more black than Will Smith & Tommy Lee
I see all these cats for who they really be
When you high up they see defeat and get jealous and try to CBV
Dollar dollar bills could get you with R&B Singers
Dollar dollar bills could turn homies into Pachangas
Dollar dollar bills could make people feel like they bigger
I bet everybody with you, as long as you got them figures
But you all good, for it, Back home's, boring
And you got, bills, So you keep, touring
And now you obligated, ghost speakers your publicist
Telling you to say this, smiling know when you hate it
And you in a position that people would kill to be in
They don't even know the real, they only love what they seeing
Sometimes you gotta chill, sit back, be grateful
Tame the beast of fame or it just might break you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
So now you stuck in it, too much green ain't healthy for you
But you love, spinach, and the singing, women, and them free, clothes
And the transportation
The rooms and the hotels the labels pay for you to stay in
Suppose your friends don't pick up their phone, when they see your number
They anticipated heat, but you didn't see the summer
Bummer, you were supposed to blow but now your broke
Packing your bags and missing your soul
The end of the world and your looking for ?
Your just a has-been from the old days
You can't ride this new wave
The label took what you made
So best believe they're paid
You didn't make it far so your A&R ain't on your radar
Threw the deuces up like later
They are, focused on a new artist
Took your whole style, even your old beats
They made you a star, then they kicked you out the picture
Promised you would be richer, but look at how they did ya

[Hook x3]Alright then, bitch
Ha. Yahhhh
Uhhhhh
A million mothafuckin' fans on that ass, biotch!
Feels amazin'!
Ladies and gentlemen, I've always been the same kid, but now I'm famous
And I ain't even have to change shit

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey yo, they keep on sayin' this dude back, this dude back
But I ain't sound like this dude, bitch I'm Mac
Now these girls all tryna suck my dick, I rap
I may let her if I'm sippin' that yak
Yeah, too fly, submarine in the sky
Can't go out in public I better get a disguise
It's better to be yourself, don't ever just slip a lie
While I'm drivin' with the top down, listenin' to plies
Chicken wings and fries, I'm in love with all the simple things
Little things, hoes just be around always bickering
I got some money, threw some diamonds on a pinky ring
That's why your favorite girl probably on my ding a ling
Chief blunts with peanut, standin' on a tree stump
Rappers need to keep up, my bitches double D cup
She fucks, but she ain't no slut and she know that
She freeze up, livin' in the moment get a Kodak
Hold that, wait for it to flash, get the picture
I ain't doing much, just out on this adventure
Bus around the country, but I'm travelin' the world
With all these rappers that be hating like I'm battlin' with girls

[Hook]
Hey yo this where the hook be
But I ain't got no hook you pussy
I said this where the hook be
But bitch I ain't got a fucking hook you pussy
Yeah bitch, that could be a hook
You know what I'mma rap
If it's ok with ya'll
And you can tell me if it was nice

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey yo I kinda want a fur coat, kinda want a grill
She met me at the party, now she kinda want to chill
I ain't on no pills, just a little weed, molly, and lean
Yeah I did a couple drugs, now they callin' me Sheen
This was all a dream just a week ago, now I got a heap of dough
I keep a ho, that always got some weed to roll
All these rappers wack but I don't ever see 'em close
The illest mothafucka in it we don't need to vote
Cause I don't give a fuck what y'all think
And I don't give a fuck what that dude on that blog think
Yeah I seen hay, been in an accord in 3 states
Had to deal with cheapskates, who always want a free play
You hold the weight of the world, I bet your knees break
Put my dick in a bitch hand, keepsake
You can't keep that, fuck off my case
You can keep some residue if I bust on your face
I'm just playin', mistake him as asian
Always been amazin', since days I've been hangin'
In ancient places, now the kid famous
And he ain't even have to change shit, biatch!

A million mothafuckin' fans
Just want to take a second to thank ya'll, you feel me?
Thanks for fuckin' with the kid from day one
You know what I'm saying, Blue Slide Park November 8th
I'll see ya'll then alright
Chyaa

Suck my dick
Hahahahaha
We should keep that
Ohh shit it worked again! Biotch!
So I just threw this fuckin' mixtape together cuz I love ya'll
How nice am I?[Verse 1]
This might come as sort of a surprise
But, I'mma have to put my two weeks in
I wanted this relationship to work
But this relationship is work
And we both know I hate doing that shit
So rather than waste time tryin' to find out what the hell is missin'
Like, for instance, this is missin' a bass line
We can both just call the thing off and find some new fling
Both of us can start giving all of our face time to
And it's true, lately I ain't been trying as hard
But you started this, so why not try this on for starts?
You're like the only one I'm textin' but you go through my phone
Always assumin' that I'm sextin' even though I'm alone
Now tell me that ain't wrong
You said you're buildin' up trust but it's been over six months
Now tell me that ain't long
Already cheated on me once, kind of lookin' like a dunce
But I stayed anyway
Not tell me that ain't strong
I mean, come on. Everybody told me to fall back
Cause what I'm dealin' with is all bad
Fortunate for you, I don't listen to none of my peers
So all that really great advice was fallin' on dead ears
I mean, you're everything I wanted: mentally and physically
The only thing I hated was your history. You gettin' me?
Couldn't take the walls down your exes made you put up
Hope some day you learn when to put your foot down and lift your foot up(Radio static)

(Old school RnB/hip hop tune playing)

(Radio static)... nope!

I like it when ya... Hold me tight

(Radio static)

[audio sample]

Fucking...clap man
Im thirsty man
Any time a nigga touch they door knob he at they door
Yo what the fuck are you doing?
Why are you here right now?
Im starvin', starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J song


[Verse 1:Astro]
Had a discussion with mom dukes
She said next year? you're going to college
Can't be sitting in the crib if you don’t take off with this rhyming
And she Jamaican
So I ain't really have an option
Went in my bedroom and started plotting
How do I, become a millionaire in a year while still keeping it real
Hollywood code won't give me the chills
I keep my soul and my mental straight kid
Gotta Make it, the universe got an obligation
Make sure I go worldwide before the fakes dominate
Chill in the shade, fathered the game
Now I got (?) in the rays
My homie gotta work tomorrow I got a show tomorrow
And we the same god damn age
Ain't it crazy how life works?
The loser got the upper hand
Snuck in like (?) killin’ cats like son of sam
In the summer man time flies!
I use to be a fly in the wall observing it all
But now I fall In the category with the statutory MC’s
Preach, making dollars with my sermons like EPMD
This is deeper than metaphors my rhymes got better causes
Ain't off this, til I got offers up in the office
Be cautious there's more snakes in the garden than plants
Long as I got my fam I don’t need no friends
Took a pen, made it out the state
First time flying was the BET awards
Second time flying was the factor
So I ain't never waste no mileage
Moves bigger than Christopher Wallace, still act childish
Running this like Forest Gump
Forget what they said
I ain't Frank Ocean, I ain't worried bout no man
I got dedication and zero patients, Lets get this Gusto
Before I turn legal
These bars make me comfortable like Beanie sigel
Im at the top of the rock, they look at me like a hero
I ain't tryna appeal tho
I just tell my story, hoping they understand it
Feet planted, takin’ over the planet cos god planned it
Peace God, you too could be in this position
But I doubt that you’ll ever reach this level of spitting
I put, blood sweat and tears in to what you hear
That’s why the hippy and gimmicky mc’s fear when im near
I got approval from the legends
The only ones that don’t respect it is the ones resting
So till i'm mic checkin up in heaven?
I treat yall like prey Im starvin’
Stomach growling for that house on the islands
Said Stomach growling for that number one hit
Got the sound that they miss, so I just can't miss
I need love,  From one of those around the way girls
She gotta have a big old Butt, a nice lil strut
Jack the ripper how im doin' it
Can't go wrong
Starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J song[All Verses: BrandUn DeShay]
I want you
I, I want you to listen to every word so you know it’s about you
I scream, cause damn it’s been a rocky road
This might seem confusing but you got me though
We’ll be the last to laugh
But we can’t move forward until we move past our past
I think we got caught up
Playin’ handyman, now we puttin’ them walls up
Nevermind, Everytime the past was brought up
We would say the rudest things that we could’ve thought of
But everytime we would think of giving it all up
We end up right back where we started, without trust
We gotta do more than that
We gotta do better than
We gotta show the world how to love, let’s set a trend

This love is the hardest thing that I had to let go
Cause you the one who taught me to let all this shit show
Cause I wasn’t good and that, and probably never will
So whether I stay or go, you’ll probly be better still
I swear it’s not that I care less
I’m just honestly careless. .with your heart
I swear that all my intentions were good
I apologize for being a stick in the mud
On those days you only wanted my company
I find a way to spend the whole day reluctantly
And just to fuck you up, I turn around and say something sweet
And now we both smilin' and layin' so comfortably
And everything’s new like we shook hands
You know I’m a bad boy, but I’m a good man
Unpredictable like Chicago Weather
Built a time machine just to love you forever
And when I get the green, everything’s on me
Four words I never wanna say:
Long time no see
Cause missin’ you is bad for my heart
I feel like Lord Voldemort how I split my soul apart, heh, horcruxes

I know it’s tough when I don’t show love back
Bring up the old times cause you want more of that
And you deserve it, but pride is what makes me a man
I swear it’s killin me damn I can’t murder it
A smart girl knows how to love
A smarter girl knows who to love
I’m smart enough to know it’s you I love
And some day the world ain’t gun’ know what to do with us
They say misery loves company
And you lookin’ like you could use someone to talk to
Need a guide in life? I’ll be your walkthrough
It won’t change, I got you
But if it’s not too late
Not talkin’ bout the time, I’m talkin bout me n’ you
So if it’s not too late for us, there’s something that I’ve always wanted to do

[Ending: Hook]

I wanted to bring her flowers
I wanted to bring her flowers to her job and we can watch the sunrise
I wanted to bring her flowers
I wanted to bring her flowers to her job and we can watch the sunrise
Sunrise
