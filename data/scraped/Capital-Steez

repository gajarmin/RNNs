[Intro]
It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive

[Verse 1: Joey]
Niggas don't want war I'm a martian with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right, your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts, like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit out to inaugurate
My P.E conglomerates bout to P-E-E on any wanna B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go
Ba boom Ba boom Ba boom boom
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that K
Like every day in every way and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is pray
Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know whats hit them – through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best, I'm like you're so right
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

[Interlude]
Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E, Public Enemy, Assassinate us, bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything son
Fuck government, Fuck, listenin' and shit

You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Stopped spitting fire cause my motherfuckin lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
With a mind of fine of interest for your finest interests
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
Cause P.E's about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin' "fuck censorship!"
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond - nigga[Produced by Statik Selektah]

(Capital STEEZ, Rest in peace)

[Intro: Common]
They say signs of the end is near

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
And I quote, we came like them niggas in boats
Still think it's a joke, your third eye vision is broke
We lifted from smoke and floating, that's how I got my aura open
Check the horoscopes, though; you could say I'm horror scoping
You catch me floating on a four-leaf clover
That's the pot of gold so we sonnin' them like Maury Povich
We gone need paternity tests I guess
Cause them vets ain't learning it step-by-step
It's Beast Coast, we the murderous set
We raining fire, and I don't mean the burners and techs
You gotta love it, all 47 of us
You ain't got a number, then I guess we gotta get you covered
I'm connecting to my brethren with the
West side connection cause he say he got the best there
We got the birds like 2-4-7
So I'm a hit you back in a second, cause we already

[Bridge: Capital STEEZ & Joey Bada$$]
Lifted, we lifted, we lifted, you dreamt it
We lived it, we lived it, we lived it, so we already
Lifted, we lifted, we lifted, we dreamt it
We lived it, we lifted

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Said you could run, but my niggas will still erase ya
Everywhere I go, they just copy and paste us
Pace yourself, wanksta you ain't like that ain't ya? Kerosene for your
Chaser, waste yourself, and thank your boy
Shots on me, I'm not drunk, let me explain my story
I'm not under, I'm higher than who my connect employ
Said for sure he got fire, most dankest, take a whiff
The gracious, he never lace the shit, take a trip
To the astrals, welcome to my land 
It's your first OBE? Tell me how has your body been?
Spinning wheels on the axle of my embodiment, 
Don't waste your breath, you can't BS, we know what your body meant
Through third eye codes, your third eye closed
If Steve Jobs made you purchase a third iPhone
All seeing eyes know what eye means
But 33 degrees can't make us freeze
Said they watered us down so they forced to believe
That they won us through force and greed
Eye said they warning us now so of course they need to be
Wanting a force to lead
They watered us down so they forces believe
That they won us through force and greed

[Bridge: Capital STEEZ & Joey Bada$$]
Said we already lifted, we lifted, we lifted, we dreamt it
We lived it

[Verse 3: CJ Fly]
I'm opening up my chakras; it's potent enough I chop it
I'm pointing out all impostors plotting to block my commas, trying to calm us
Down, but it ain't happening, we mad as shit
Still managing, girl can I bust if I got cannabis?
A half a zip could have her pants unzipped
Ain't enough romantic shit, so don't be sadden if you couldn't have a kiss
I'm still a bastard kid with blackened lips; I'm still a
Pacifist, but if you ask for it, then I could pass a fist
You don't smoke -ism, I'll introduce you, not a buddah
Abuser, feel like a Bad Boy when I take two puffs, I and I
Be stoned so Mary Jane is like Medusa, had keys
For dough, would have thought he was a super, but that's when I grew up
To realize I'm in a place to be
Made vacancy and still the emcee, they know they can't see, we part of the
Resistance, we'll fix things, persistence, we shifting
We drifting, we lifted

[Outro: Nas]
From the spliff that I lift -
From the spliff that I lift -
From the spliff that I lift and inhale[Produced by Knxwledge]

[Intro (Sample)]
Yes, Strawberries

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I'm a beast with these flows
Two birds, one stoned, you get geese’d when trees rolled
They say I'm evil cause I trained my ego to see gold
Cause he know, seagulls couldn't see these goals, please
It's the return of the beast coast
No cash flashed, but the cheese still make teeth show
Incognito, is how you move on the strip
What you trynna be Vito? Well there's rules to this shit
Don't get clapped, ya'll ain't real spitters, ya'll lips chapped
Better watch it, Mr. Nicewatch, don't risk that
I got a 6 pack of bare skill that I spill like that
And everybody know (That shit crack!)
Ya'll niggas softspoken, down below choking
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men
There's makes sense why you want beef, well this frozen
It's nuts for you screwed in the tool, and can't hold em
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico
My lyrical span is what the fans is demandin'
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu stand in
Ain't no half steppin' around me
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
The young cop killer, I'm dat ill, so doc' will ya
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer....nigga

[Verse 2:Capital STEEZ]
Soul searchin' 'till my flows are perfect
I ain't trynna be a slave to grow old from workin'
Sorry BADA$$, you lucky that I peeped it second
Tell them niggas keep it steppin' with they beat selection
Check the melodies, it's so heavenly
That shit'll get your hipster move with no 7D's
Audi-opium, can I bust soliloquies
Got that shit mix and mastered both remedies
Grab a spoonful, we sturrin' up a pot
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot
I'm flowin' like a volcano and drippin' verses off the top
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid
It's in my jeans so don't worry what my pants is
Get with the script it's that ignorant shit
And they bound to get sick of us quick but I ain't sealin' my lips
It's a shift, I know you feel it man
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man
When it comes to kickin' verses I'm Mr. Van Damme
Crushin' strawberries it's a jam
So throw up both hands if you can
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit, until they bury me
My volume is going in depth with longevity
Stupids[Hook]
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
Started blazing and stargazing
See how you can reach your farthest aspirations
It's like holy matrimony in The Matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a .47 with a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try and hide divine intentions
It's like, let em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life has the lemons it's time to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different days, different highs, different haze
Kama Sutra with miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her, she a vibrant thang

[Hook]

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
You niggas is suspect and I'm just a ruffneck
That wasn't breaking pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet she getting rough sex no sunset
I like a chick with a buck tooth yeah it could get fucked too
We keep one eye open they sus too
Never tell em my government make any covenant bitches be loving it
Say not to put a glove on it some funny shit
You must've thought I was a dummy Miss
I feed lines to felines just to get up in their tummies quick
Yeah you got tricks but I got five more
So any game you try to play you better know I got the high score
You better settle down cause you not on my level now
The Pros is semi-circle they can tell the world you get around
Some niggas clowns what's the shit about
They used to doubt now they see us sprout and I'm out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chuck Strangers]
When I was thirteen I was bad, rapping about guns we never had
Now we smoke raws with filter tips, old homies talking shit
Said you was best of mine but you stay plotting on that dime
Thought cause we was cool before that we gon' take yo ass on tour fuck nah
This my chance to get it
How you entitled to my shine, nigga you ain't help me get it
Now these niggas see me getting it, check the statements on my debit
My profile get requested but I never hit accept
Hit the sour to the chest, I reflect
When I was fourteen, up late, eyes glued to the sampler screen
Eyes beam, cause we can make it better
Smoking on that Jack Herer, welcome to the Progressive Era

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Dyemond Lewis]
And brains don't matter
But tell me what really matters when you pissed off at the world
Like you got a crazy bladder and
Momma always said that shit don't come on silver platters
So I gather my thoughts
And make use of all these synonyms
Cause I could never swallow the truth
Like it's cinnamon
Excuse me if I'm militant the sinning men in my hood
Could leave a nigga quivering like goddamn
Deliver him the venom and his liver is corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a standstill so tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart, still seem to be simmering
Now take that little simmer and turn it into adrenaline
Penicillin could not stop the drive he be giving em like
Mad fours (Fords) and fast forward let's get to the part where his records
Could 'ford him a couple Fords like Lord
Ain't he gifted, Christmas just doesn't fit him
I need my own holiday and by the way
I'mma possibly own Monopoly and all McDonald's property
Cause I won't live in poverty like

[Hook]

[Verse 5: NYCk Caution]
In the clouds come and find me son, I'm flier than Hermione
Homie tripping got em sounding like Hansen in the nineties
Charlie Manson your whole body cause that damage in your party
Can you manage what I'm dishing out, go get your wishing count
You sell me something then I flip that amount
I just switched that account, get that profit then I'm out yeah
They all wonder but it's Nyck bitch don't doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth
Man I'm violent ring the siren with these bars I'm reciting
Cars with no license
Hard man, I'm feeling like a spartan with a trident damn
Picture perfect, bet I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot, no Louisiana purchase
So declare that, with my hair back
You want a fair one, catch a fair smack
I hunt up on my prey
So pray I ain't hunting on your ass today, like be afraid

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Kirk Knight]
Cool cuts flow, the deli can't touch this
Slipping like fishes, choking when you hit the cypher
And I ain't talking weed smoke but I let the weed blow
Anything just let the leaves know, oh
Sucka's fuck around, get clapped where you rest at
Nigga saying you cracking, fire break you imagination ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find sex in these verses
But I got your attention, it's part of my ascension
But if I keep toking this strain is gonna leave me stranded
In this dimension, or to mention
Niggas is snitching, might charge me with battery
But fuck that cause piss was never in your anatomy
So don't try to lie on a nigga that got mine on my third eye shit

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Rokamouth]
Man I'm on my higher degrees without my masters
I could use my words to urge into disasters
Niggas wanna know how my wheels keep on spinning
And they see we getting love cause they see the pros is winning
Cause we giving love back so they peeping how we fitting
Ain't gonna have no sus nigga stepping to me
I like to keep my chakras open so respect my G
I got the bush going in, repping FPT
So sus niggas watch your back pros next to me
I got Chuck on the team to collect the green
And show these suspect niggas what it mean to scheme
Another Apex predator crushing your dreams
Gonna get your wig pushed back between my cream
Taking all you sus niggas throw you out the scene
I'm taking all you sus niggas throw you out the scene
Taking all you sus niggas throw you out the scene

[Hook]

[Verse 8: T'nah Apex]
The P the R the O the Dette
Never am I vexed, I'm always calm, cool, collect
Unless you disrespect, I wreck you verbally
So expect the worst from me, I beck you with my intellect
You best be circumspect check, made you making all the wrong moves
Do I intimidate you or more infuriate you
Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gold
Lovers I decapitate with everything I say, see
Come sneak a peak and, tell me what you peeping
Then struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seeing
It is what here sits in the midst of us, yeah it's quite mysterious
No you're not delirious, I'm serious it's clear to us
Add some crystals gonna see gold then platinum
Seen it on some tarots before, so I know how it is all gonna go down
Gotta go more uptown, more in the cloud
Cause didn't ya know by now, I'm skyline bound
And my time's now, I don't graze ground, I'm new in your town
So assume what you please but you don't know me
Say what you please but you don't know T'nah

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Dessy Hinds]
Who that mofo who came to show boat just cause he float like no other
Style smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest
Is making real tracks with feelings, people ain't feel yet
Dessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line
The bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge, rap is in my blood
So much, my capularies adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January, every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times than my school's lunch line
So if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine

[Hook]

[Verse 10: Joey Bada$$]
'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is (s)ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you could see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul, probably you know
I found mines right through the pencil, started bodying flows but fuck that
This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to squeal
This one for my people, headed to the top, no redo
Thinking up evil but see no evil just be knievel
I ain't ask to be this good, they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me clever
See God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error
The Era

[Hook: Pro Era][Produced by Free The Robots]

[Intro]
Bout to one-take this shit, nigga

[Hook]
Dear diary, what a day it's been
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream

[Verse 1]
Illuminati tryin' to read my mind with a eagle eye
And the haze got me thinkin', why
We killed Osama and plenty innocent people died
We should see the signs, but we Stevie blind
No disrespect to the man or the legend, but
I'm sick and tired of askin' my brethren if
It all ends in 2011
Would God come through or would he actually forget us?
Cause, apocalypse is getting closer
But they're more focused on our lil youth sippin' soda
Fuck the sugar act, niggas out pushin' crack
And I lost my father figure because of that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So can I live? or is my brother tryin' to gun me down
Scuffle a couple of rounds 'til we hear the thunder sound
No lightning, clash of the titans
And after the violence a moment of silence
Cause I want mine the fast way
The ski mask way, lookin' for a fast pay
And instead of stickin' up for each other
We pickin' up guns and stickin' up our brothers
So fuck 'em all, I'm comin' through ragin'
And I won't stop 'til Reagan is caged in
Mom tell me I should let the Lord handle it
The arm of the law is tryin' to man-handle us
A man's world, but a white man's planet
And the doors are slowly closing while we fallin' through the cracks of it
It's a shame that flippin' crack will be
The best alternative if you don't make it rappin'
These crack houses and trap houses are trappin' us in
And in the end we're gonna remain stagnant
I ain't havin' it

[Hook][Intro]
(I fall in love, too fast)

[Verse 1]
This goes for Mrs. Whats-Her-Name
I know that something changed before the money came
But you got real Shady, Aftermath
I was passed reminiscing over our past
Claim you don't remember it
But when I went and told your friends in the most intimate details
Now you wanna censor shit
Trying to fix the bits and pieces of what's left of it
But even when it's fixed, it's so delicate
True love is so hard to find
And they say that once you found it you lost your mind
Even some of my niggas done grew apart with time
Truthfully I needed the space, you're far too kind
I guess I gotta let it be
Bagir said I gotta big year ahead of me
Jack told me that world will see eventually
Even my worse enemy is praying for the best for me
Dreams money can buy
When you fall in love and realize your love was a lie
And I guess that it was lust that flooded my eyes
Slim waist, thick cake, lovable thighs
I put that on the name of king
I'm a first class nigga, coach told "you ain't make the team"
Fuck chasing cheese
Homie, I'm chasing dreams
And fans make up for the rest like Maybelline

[Verse 2]
And I'm the bad guy yet again
Spend so much time trying to find who the victim is
And if we put it in the eyes of the witnesses
I still get the blame for fucking up in the beginning, shit
You told me you was over that, grow up
And you say you saw us holding hands, so what?
If you can't look me in my eyes and respect me enough
Then I guess you getting left in the dust
With no feedback
Having late night conversations
Contemplating, both knowing that my time is wasted
Mood swings all time of the day
With childish behavior admitting that I was kind of complacent
And knowing this could be the end of it
Three months and she still ain't send a hint
Now she fucking with the next nigga claiming it's her friend and shit
You really take me for that much of a fool huh?
I had bitches on hold for a long time
To hear the perfect reason to just give them the walk sign
So you could talk your shit and I'mma talk mine
And hit me when you finish cause this is the fourth time
I've crossed your line when you crossed mine
You crossed my mind just looking at lost time
I can't stress it no harder then this
And I forgot to tell you, karma's a bitch
High school girls be acting all retarded and shit
Ignoring my shit, I know you see me calling you, Miss
And if I called you a bitch, it must of slipped out
I got caught in the midst, and then you flipped out
Whitney hit the rock hard enough and stop getting loud and James is in a grave
So I'm gonna have to pull a Chrissy brown
I'm gonna laugh when they Rihanna on your ass
Cause you love it when you binded and gagged right?
Remember that time in the bathroom?
I left it on your lower back like a tattoo
I'm just letting off mad fumes
And I'm gonna have to fill the shoes of this bad dude[Produced by Bruce Leekix]

[Verse 1]
It's like I can't think of the words, only a melody
Looping in my mind but my heart still skips a beat
I admire your style and your smile. A whole list of things
And I think that it's a shame, that I don't get to see you enough
And I been trying to make you mine for at least a few months
You steady running through my mind, so what's keeping you pumped ?
And as for them pumps, it's really bringing out the way that you strut
Like, who wouldn't want a girl with elegance, intelligence
And a cute way of presenting it?
I see where your potential is
And I know that even with or without me, you'll keep on ascending
Let me tune into your spiritual channel
My sleeping beauty all alone in her castle
You're golden, glowing through shadows
Cupid got his bow and his arrow when I throw in the towel

[Hook] x8
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
(I'm not saying you should let us in
I'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)

[Verse 2]
Still better my days, by drawing hearts around my Es's and J's
And thinking bout' you when I get on the stage
You're a lot more mature than the women your age
And I really don't expect it to change
So take this as a token of my loyalty
It started with a blueprint, now I need a supporting beam
Way before the contracts, you saw a lot more in me
I can't define it metaphorically
You're like a diamond in the rough or the lighter to my dutch
That was blunt, but I can't lie you firing it up
And by myself it's hard for me to face it
All I need is patience to help keep this flame lit
And that look in your eyes is pretentious
It's no strings attached, so why less affection
And we both trying to find some reception
I got you unlocked, don't hide this connection

[Hook] x8[Verse 1]
Check this
Who you wanna try and flex with
My senses say you stressin' cause we haven't digressed yet
Climbin' the ladder while supplyin' rhyme patterns
That perhaps been scattered in my mind since back then
The Backwoods, had to make a classic so match this
It's like magic, mix the spinach with the cabbage
In fact I caught the few cap from the shroom patch
Guess whose back with new raps smothered in boom bap
Assume cat, flipped it back like eyelids
To show em how I live, now she blowing down twigs
They both thin and they look like twins
I'm usin' my aura power to overpower the feds
Shit, and act like I never know enough
Thought it was a joke until the numbers started showing up
Roll it up in steam with the Steelo lean
All green you would think it was casino themed man
And it's a different rhythm everytime
Had to switch the signs just to let designers synthesize
Adjust the frequency divine how we synthesize
13 steps, let the enterprise synchronize
And welcome back to the block cuz, smoking 47 blunts a day like true rastas

[Intro]
The circus is a jungle, why would I stop blazin O's?
Steezy Baby!

[Verse 1]
Said, let me introduce you to the elements
Do it with eloquence, I'm back and I'm better than I ever been
And I ain't goin' nowhere, shit I've been flowing for years
Look, he's here and he's growin' a beard now
How's that for your mainstream?
It's me against time, to try to work against this man's dream
Cause I get more spins than clock radios
Radio the cops and tell them to stop hating
No, I'm not taking "no" for an answer anymore
The circus is a jungle, why would I stop blazin O's?
You actin' like I'm out here rapin' hoes
I'm not a criminal, so what the fuck you take me for?
Cause I'm a lower class citizen
Tough pill to swallow like broken glass and cinnamon
Indiscriminate so my vision is red and green like Christmases
Bring them toe tags in again

Yo-yo, y-yo, yo
It's Hip Hop Bitch!

[Verse 2]
Said, let me introduce you to the elements
Ay, you- I heard you shining, but I got that gold membership
I rose from the bush like Valentine's petals
From an unstable family of alkali metals
Hittin' prime time like channel 5 specials
And I never handled rock like Palestine rebels with pebbles
The antics and antiquities with ease and MR.STEEZ
Always got a trick up my sleeve, bitch, please!
Ain't shit magic or witch craft
Switch class and I barely just passed
A young grasshopper that's trying to skip pads
She trying to get bent like light when it hits glass
Bong smoke got me blazed as hell
Burnin' weight like the 47 J's I scale
You can tell by the amazing smell
And my eyes stay tight like I'm Asian, well[Produced by Joey Bada$$]

[Intro]
Muh-fucking Pirates (Pirates) , We some muh-fucking pirates

[Verse 1: Capital Steez]
Look, now I could start it off with a whole new excerpt
A revisit what them experts said first
Your favorite rapper’s a problem I’m the next worst
It’s the naked truth I seep through em like wet shirts
Life’s a bitch, well I’m a super soaker
The newest flow got the mainstream moving over
Mother Nature got me shining from the depth of my soul
So every time you see her rise in a super nova
And in a world of dead presidents and counterfeits
Our generation is bound to take a count of it
I’m Barry Bonds with my count of hits
I put a fork in it, cork in it, hoping that it kinda fits
And this can turn into a hostage situation
'cuz I been sitting patient and I’m kinda sick of waitin’
John Q holdin’ up the doctors and the patients but sticking up the nurses is my favorite

[Hook: Capital Steez]
(Heh) We some muh-fucking pirates, We some muh-fucking pirates
And I decided that I would let my mind just ride on autopilot one word decribes it (2x)

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
I be that dirty mutherfucker, bitches want to clean me up
She needs a rest from the cons n She wants me to cuff
She got double D’s, I call it a drug bust
But I’m not slipping over lust, in God we trust, plus
I came from the bottom, who do you think you’re touching?
Bust in ya girl’s face, I know I’m good for nuttin’
All I do is smoke weed, set sails, and wait for my connect to hit me back with a little sumchin’
I speed so fast it’ll make ya head spin, who who’s that nigga that’s revvin’ the engine
I stand out when I stand up never did blend in
These bitches say I’m smoothy, though I’m rough around the edges
Ak-47 , Steez already said fuck ya reverend, we guna do this shit until forever end
So fucking pirates guna rain/reighn on ya parade, my eyes are hellabent and I stay hella laidback

[Hook/Outro Hook][Verse 1: PHONZZ]
If you want it you got to take it, their's no holding back
Trust me I'm never playing, I ain't holding back
I style [?] and spitting my soul on tracks
I guess [?] and no I'm not giving it back
That would be foolish, matter of fact useless
Holla back deuces, man
They said I couldn't do shit, now they looking stupid
Most complexness to ever hit the loot and
Now what they gonna do [?]
I think they mad, wishing they had
This is way past what the lyrics surpass
Once again I took the bar too high
Well, no, way too low
Line for line, there he go again
And he jimmy two times, feeling like goofy guy
Not even in my prime, looking for the limes
Sprite got me feeling right, I think you got it twisted
We need to revisit, well hold up
Wait, a minute, I'm never to the point
I got my pencil running out on the beat
Can't you see this diarrhea of the mouth
Anyways in these days I realize what it's about
Getting paid and having a maid
Got to make your move, not too late not too soon
Life isn't forever, life isn't forever


[Bridge x6]
This is how we chill from 93' till
This is how we chill from 93' till

[Verse 2: JaKK the Rhymer]
Killing shit with diligence, passionate with passages
[?] with rap, I'm packing it every chapter and
Picasso in this vomitspit
Addicted to the art, Andy Warhol it
Real rhyme and it been underground
The ripper been a heavyweight but now they giving him pounds
Outstanding how the rhymer do it, flow so potent
Influence like a potion, a fluid leave them drowning
The uncrowned kings Brooklyn's own and
With these poems they follow my rhymer's flows
And X them chromosomes holmes
Duck down or get beheaded then
Don't feed the rhymer after dark with the gremlin
Testing 'em, I don't think you want to be testing me
And the next MC to be chopped another recipe
Lyrical vasectomy or the Smith & Wesson will
Leave a rhymer desolate you rocking with rap excellence
Mines in the rhymes I conquer mines in stealth
Never trapped with fame or blind with wealth
Never rap for fame or rhyme for wealth
Nine trae get lost and find yourself

[Bridge]Capital STEEZ - AmeriKKKan KorruptionCapital STEEZ - AmeriKKKan Korruption: Reloaded[Produced by Kirk Knight]

[Verse 1]
We some motherfuckin apex predators
Witness the genesis
Out for dead presidents, VPs and delegates
Ain't smoking on the delicate
Weighin out the heavy shit
You could get high off the smell of it
It’s like dope in your nostrils
AK for your brain made them open they chakras
Apollo’s apostles, stroke of Picasso
Bonita Appleboom trying go to mi casa
She told me that she not bilingual
But got two tongues if that’s what you're into
I got inside her mental, chicks that I been through, it's simple
Now I’m tryna figure how to bend spoons
The prodigy of an alchemist
It’s Indigos in rotation bringing amethyst
Must be out your cranium to even try and aim at this
I can't be a Satanist, I don’t know who Satan is
Defy your own limits
They thought that I would die but I survived off spinach
Macho man, Popeye did it
And I know you lookin down so, Pop I did it
The key to my lyric is my physic
Astrophysical, I can tap into your spirit
Of course I’m talkin to you
And of course I’m targetin' you[Intro: Chuck Strangers]
Uh, it's Chuck, what the fuck ?
Alright here it go, it's Chuck
Actually I won't even rap on this shit
I ain't even produce this shit neither, This is Doom's shit
Fuck ya bro, fuck ya'll nigga. Ya'll ain't even take one of my beats and shit
CJ on this shit. That horny ass nigga STEEZ. (No Homo Though)
Fuck ya cardigan wearing niggas. P.E. Nigga
Thought I was done talking shit, huh? Thought I was done, huh?
Naw, hold up
CJ get em!

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Ready set go, you run the tech blow
This the threshold to let those vets know
A few old cats being let go
Taking bitches for just strolls
Haven't been having fun in heaven
When de mon ask if you down say "hell no"
Immortals that just grown
Don't get old We get stoned
And spit it like chest colds from the get go
Wake up yawn, it's the break of dawn
Pass the raw tray to break up on
Wanna cop, I'll make the call
Breaking laws when we blaze the bong
Face it doll, put your make-up on
She got curves but ain't in shape at all
Been in the cut, never lick her in the cunt
Rolling up and dick her, to disable my limiter
Use telepathy to tell a bee he don't fly as well as me
Been with at least seven teens ever since the age of 17
Women definitely, but no I don't have no STDs
Must've been a dream if she seen me with a wedding ring
Left my name out but I don't let the bloggers get to me
As long as I still see my face on MTV
Pro Era, we the next MCs, that's complexing things
F'n up the game, where's the referee, Get em' STEEZ

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
Look they got it misconstrued, the illest dude
First day up on the yard and he's already trying to steal your food
And ima keep fly until I'm finish
A lion in his kingdom, y'all lying in your sentences
So he's more so a brave heart
Sick with the flow now I'm schooling all these great sharks
At the same time finding myself
If it's desire for the belt or just the power and wealth, well fuck it
I'm taking the power combo
Label em' John Doe, now my broads looks like monroe
Bro, you need to simmer down
Instead of getting loud, I'm over heads like thinking clouds
Illest sound killing in the inner city crowd
We on the throne and you Simba now
Look, matter of time and my clock is ticking
I'm still kicking until I got a pot to piss in[Verse 1: Capital Steez]
I guess niggas ain't know that I kept patrol
So excuse me if I'm seeing shit
Thinking I ain't have no self-control
Tell her eat a dick, cause I plead the fifth
I been had steez, I don't need to spit
I keep it lit, I got a keen incense
So I ain't gonna let a nigga sneak a diss
Or even feed my bullshit when I see dissent
Still got the same pros in the background
Karma came back 'round, it's about cash now
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down
Cause I swerved with the worst of the serpents
I play determined I'm a make it worth it
Talk to him, like, state your purpose
It better be perfect if I pay for service
Momma told me to get my bread up
Drug dealers say get this scrilla
Just make sure you protect your ends and
Correct the errors, the progressive era
Never thought that bud could heal us
It got my head spinning like a double helix
Live fearless, and focus in like
Fuck your feelings, I'm above the ceiling
So one for the money, two for the women
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
Fucking hoes with they third eye closed
And the other two's rolling backwards
Girl just drop when the lingerie
Then picture gorgeous head while I'm getting faded
I see right through hoes, it's X-rated
Her ex taken, so it's sex tapin'
Thoughts escaping, no brain cells
Pop pain pills, side effect is
That I'm erect and that she's a wreck
Got the bitch wide open like she's dissected
Accept it, more monies than your bank accounts
We going all out till we all out, bounce
Pray to this beast, though, you pray for the best
Breaking your ego, damn, you look stressed
You diss a peer and expecting respect
When you whisper my name, dog, you sound like a
It's whatever, though, I'm still in the mix
With my pros and my niggas pushing bricks, it's a work zone
47 is my number, hit my work phone
Blowing my line, riding 'round with the AC on
It's hot, gotta have ...patience
The best lines in the game, ain't no refunds
And since life be fun, we don't know how to act now
Pro Era, 47, came for the blackkk krown
Nigga

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Came for the black crown
Came for the black crown
Came for the black crown
Over heads like
Fresh cuts, who's next up? Next is us
So my Nexus One got text up by exes
All types of chicks I used to "F" with, "F" it
They all get passed off, get a "F" for effort
Glass jaw on records, these guaranteed smash hits
Believe that, I might drop a tape in the crash pit
Wait, we need that, it's that boom bap flow they need back
What I gotta do for a piece of pie though? I need that
But you see that broke folk with expensive taste got no
Cents but still flying to senseless places
Expensive states, I just pray that the adventure's great
Cause I'm to ignorant to read what this indenture says
I might have signed my life away today
And this road is the only
One I know back
In fact, so it's like
One for the money, two for my niggas
Three for the bitches, brief intermission
Brief intermission
Brief intermission

[Verse 4: CJ Fly]
Hope you know you're gonna be doomed when I jump in the pums
Don't wanna be smelling no fumes, so don't get it confused
Gonna get slued cooked like a stew, but I ain't, luncheon on you
Live on the edge, don't fall in love, but if you jump in it's cool
You kind of dusty, I ain't jumping the broom, like my chicks in they
Forties, cause they getting out bruise, check it
It's leave sumchins blue while this sumchin get blew
Gimme a loan when we're alone, ain't dumb so she gave me dome
Told me "Lick it." Said, "Bitch, you trippin', kick with your cameltoe."
And tell me how you getting home
Aw, shit, wrong hook
Fuck it, you from NY
And you don't like the Knicks, go ahead and cop yourself a dime
You get your shit authorized, and I'm a author on the rise
On the web, I'm like Peter Parker fighting crime
On the reel, that's how it be as soon as I drop a line
I'm warning you, try your best to not get out of line
Why? Otherwise, find yourself in deep shit
How many feet? Six, we don't want to see you eat clips
Moon child; my fault, son, if I was blocking your shine
Flying through Heathrow , ain't hard to make a hit with the way he throw
This heat though , been so maginecto ever since a nino
Now he grown, get to see the world with his brethren them
Going all the places that you've never been ever since
First for the honeys, two for the money
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
Work, work, brief intermission
Work, work
I said one for the money, two for my niggas
Three for the bitches, brief intermission
Work, work, brief intermission
Work, work, brief intermission

[Verse 5: Rokamouth]
I'm LRG in the smoker's club
The swankest 47 member with the dankest bud
Blowing smoke right in your face, that's that reefer, love
Let you peep the blunt, and follow as I lead
You could smell me around the corner, a odor of Sour Ds
Fresh zips is all I need, re-up to live this life
It's mine, it's not a dream to do it like me
Let them haters go free, brush your shoulders off, colder than the
Realest OG, I got my goon smile on so your
Shorties could see, I been rocking these joints way
Before I was flee, and I don't know who you want me to be
I'm just another emcee with this MPC
Roka flow, let me spit so cold
These bitches would never know that I'm coming so real
Off this microphone, I'm coming right off the dome
I be spitting so real if my niggas would know
We like one for the money, two for the women
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
Brief intermission

[Verse 6: Dessy Hinds]
Light-skinned nigga, but you know I'm 'bout to black
Always got that rap that make a fan wanna come back
Got back with the boom, crack with the chuneee; leave a capital
Cause I'm about to lower your case and stack soon
Cause the cash rules subliminals thrown at you, a king
Remembered in time, remember the rhyme, give 'em the bad news
I'm that crude, roll around the city in a black suit
Who could be that smooth as shots from every angle?
The words getting tangled, and the vocals getting strangled
Treating tracks like tracks, you know they getting manhandled
Pull out the weave, too; she too, ?
Rip 'em like a cheap root, then cheap shoot up in her free hoop
Won't stop 'til listeners catching ear masturbations
And the earwax gon' substitute for pre-ejaculation
And while we had 'em waiting for this hot shit like Cajun style
And Jamaican loud, what's the precipitation, nigga now?
One for the money, two for my niggas
Three for my women, brief intermission
Brief intermission
It go like
One for the money, two for my niggas
Three for the women, brief intermission

[Verse 7: Capital STEEZ]
Old-school fixed gear with the paint chippin'
Real nigga, now I'm used to the shape shifting
And the ones that I came in the game with
They can't give a damn cause we living in the same system
Good writtens, I kick 'em to the curb
Just so I could get the recognition I deserve
Got to keep it down to the earth
14.7 K Gold what I charge for a verse
That's sumchin, Amerikkkan Korruption
But they act like they never seen a young man
Enunciate with such words in abundance
So fuck the world and let every last nun sit
And I be the hood doctor
My true shottas got the good product
Paparazzi got to look proper
But my root chakra probably Foot Locker
Partner
That's one for the money, two for the bitches
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three for my niggas, brief intermission[Produced by Knxwledge]

[Verse 1: STEEZ]
I only had two problems with females
Comin' off too strong and waitin' too long to move on
To save myself a heartache, Cupid gave me a couple of coupons
And told me not to choose a chicken head with Jimmy Choos on
It's a new day, women want Louboutin
Basic necessities, you heard that "Gucci Gucci" song
And if she do me wrong, I keep it moving on my quest to find love
Still burnin til my doobie's gone
I'm lost and trying to find my route
But my thoughts only inspire me to find my roots
And my conscious won't allow me to shoot
So I only value time in the booth
If that's fine by you, true
I'm trapped in my reality
When I look in the mirror, there's a bastard staring back at me
The last chance of happiness for my family
Cause momma's getting older and it's bringing out the man in me
I wish it happened sooner cause every afternoon
I realize another day is passin that I lack improvement
I think I'm losin it
Homies asking what happened to ya
This concrete rose turned into a black petunia
I guess that's how it's supposed to go
Fuck being emotional, I'd rather braggadocio
Drown in my emotions till I overflow with doper quotes
So take a hit of this and pass it off to so and so

[Hook: Steez]
Puff, puff, pass (x3)
Are you high enough?
I'm just getting fired up

[Bridge: Steez]
I'm in it for the win cause these L's ain't doing shit
I guess I've grown used to it

[Verse 3: Jakk the Rhymer]
I need no reminisces of history
This the requiem for them hard times
We crush up mad trees in this memory trips down
Memory lane keep me steps ahead of them
I'm headed in the direction of anything that's elevating there
That's why I'm writing through the night
And momma when your son shine they ain't gon ever take our light again
Overpriced taste, we been hungry, we overdue
Watching gangstas in the tube, living like they showed me to
New Jakk city, so the whole clique paid in full
No cinema, but it's coming soon
I slow never and it's no wonder I'm in front of you
Yo, I rap circles around the globe like the sun and moon
Blessed, I was the son of a jew and the world knew
He only kept the gold wrapped round his tooth
Proof, damn, why do the good die?
Damn, pop why you leave at 49?
I'm graduating at 53 you should've held up
Still thinking about what my seed was gonna call you
"Granddad"? "Grandfather"? "Papa"?
Reminiscing riding shotgun listening to "Big Poppa"
Cause, see, daddy was a street scholar
I guess them knife wounds was mnemonic
My momma looking at me like the new Mahler
I'm hearing her, that black king make Brooklyn look like Nigeria

[Hook: Jakk the Rhymer][Verse 1: Lost]
The chosen one is not chosen
The non-righteous path
To leave a trail of blood and tears
Like a Sierra Leone death squad
God's spitting his deaths mission and in turn
[?]
So what if I'm a misfit like baggy pants
That just means there's more room for your girl to squeeze in
But that's besides the point
Because my lyrics are on point
Like ballerinas feet
[?]
Of an inner animal trying to break my rib cage
Tear apart my spleen and cut off my oxygen
But I won't be silenced
I'm the child of an unstoppable force
And an immovable object
On a crash course with a morgue
Filled with those that failed to touch the ground
I relate to those bizarre
But won't take it lying down
Who respect the hustle
And get trampled
And left in the dust
Of the lost soul torn from your worst nightmare
And go against the current
The tides are changing
So either swim or left to drown
And be enveloped in the sounds of hell hounds
[?] salvation total annihilation
Of the egotistical
Non forgivable
No elliptical can change the shape of this outcome
There's no escaping it
Final Destination that'll rock the nation
Call it D.O.A
Death of animation
Cause this shit's real as it gets
Mark the day you hear this track
See where you are and where I'm at
Compare the vocabs and subtract the difference
And make six figures while riding with LOST productions, bitch

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's Mr. J-A-Y
Look
I pledge allegiance to class rooms with missing teachers
Go ahead and cut some more jobs I don't think we need it
Spending money on sex scandals and strip teases
And these the selfish motherfuckers that we pick to lead us?
It's splurging on the murders and burglars
But I don't really think our foolish youth
Deserve to learn enough
Make sense why he grew up so dumb don't it
The main reason why I'm keeping all these blunts rolling
Heard the beat and I just knew I had to jump on it
These the wise ambitions of a young stoner
Hold up,I prefer the term herbalist
Superb young verbalist
Inspired off the purp I piff
It don't matter cause either way
I'm rolling two Ls and a J
Feelin cool till I burn my lip
I'm bumping at American terrorists
Finger to America homie
I ain't scared of shit
Unless I'm looking at the man in the mirror
And he know me way better than a specialist therapist
Shit, how you telling me I'm not gifted
When niggas stealing my styles
They shoplifting
Yeah I got some issues maybe you should stop and listen
The biggest threat and I ain't even have to pop a pistol
Fuck redemption I'm back with a vengeance
And venomous fit like slim fits bitch
It's the two blade crusade
I got my ski mask on waiting for doomsday
And I don't give a fuck on what you say
Or she say that he said she said cliche[Produced by Joey Bada$$]

[Intro]
So come fly with me, bitch

[Verse 1]
You got a man and I know you can't leave him
But I know you met me for a reason
Him and I are two different extremes so I know what they mean by people in seasons
You in a hot-cold relationship
And you really don't know what to think of it
But I think you need to take a risk
Cause a girl like you needs a man like me
Me, I know people in high places
That's the only reason I've been up on hiatus
Sky scrapin', big city livin', so trust me I rock stages outrageous
I know you can't offer much, and
These little niggas like to talk too much
But I can tell they be calling a bluff
So I don't see the harm in you callin me up

[Hook]
What you need is some bonafide lovin
I could make you feel like a grown ass woman
No problem, take it how you want it
I can take you overseas, for I'm over my budget
What you need is some bonafide lovin
I could make you feel like a grown ass woman
First, it's the finer things
And that's only if you with it, so make your decision

[Verse 2]
It sound like you torn in the middle
Like you getting on with more than a little
Tell him he ain't forced to be with you
Maybe he'll get the bigger picture if it's drawn with a stencil
I'm Leonardo or Pablo Picasso
You're Mona Lisa with the smile of a model
Pick a place, we can fly there tomorrow
But your man tryin' to drive over pot holes
He oughta get left
We off that, then we on to the next
You rockin' with the best, boardin' a jet
And you already mentioned you’re bored with the sex
He got you a promise ring
I got diamonds and all kinds of bling
But first, it's the finer things
And that's only if you with it
So make your decision

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Girl, if um, I were you then, I would choose that
I gotta move cuz tou got a man, and um
He's kinda slippin', but you stickin with him, and
That's your decision, decision
Girl, if, I were you then I would choose that
I gotta move cuz, you got a man, and I
Know I ain't helpin, but
You can't be selfish, cuz
It's either him or me, so
Girl, if... I were you then...
I'm talkin shit right now...
And I'll still probably fuck yo bitch nigga! Swag!
I'm sorry Based God!
Kinda dissed you and shit
But I'll still probably fuck yo bitch nigga

[Hook][Verse 1: MONK]

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
This cali grown got me hella blown
With my head up in the stars like a telescope

You can probably find me with a yellowbone
And she probably trying to get in the zone or something
It's enticing, he got a bad temper like lightning
He never hit twice in the same spot
I suggest you stand back if you can't box
These Vans never even hit the skate shop
I'm on bullshit chillen in a tank-top
With like 3 bad bitches, Baywatch
My bad, I don't really like degrading women
But half these rappers ain't living how they say they living
The line between real and fake is now paper thin
And this is sucker free, so at least try to pay attention
Or pay your dues, and don't make a move
It's pay-per-view, no cablevision

[Verse 3: Rokamouth][Intro]
Right, all week and shit uh
Check, check, (turn my level up), check (one time) check

[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
Ok, vanity and insanity gives me my fuckin peace of mind
Shootin ten millimeters of thoughts, thats just my peace of mind
Give me mine, I gotta go, I gotta eat, I gotta shine
This is my generation, confederation see through lies
Treaties of BB bread me bean bc beegee of fiji water, fuck you coming from?
Dickhead man, you fuckin up, militant or long shot give me bread then I play my part
And apparently parently until I see through dark
To the playground, dont play on grounds until my kingdom comes
And if your body is a temple then let that kingdom come
So check if hell freeze over, then were all over
Niggas shootin down the range in a Range Rover
Heroin in a range rover (rover) and its all over
Check

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
Tell me what they want from me?
Fuck that shit roll up the trees
Life ain't nothing but a lucid dream, but I must admit I could use the cheese
King Capital, seen so many colors got blackened thoughts
In a psych ward with a mic cord they can't say nothing to him so they backing off
So I snuck in the room like an elephant, you can't hide the truth and thats evident
Take a puff just to find out where heaven is, theres the stuff grind for the smell of it
Giving the cops, a reason to stop, not the 47, not the beams and the gloccs
Third eye wide gonna aim for the top
I made that shit from the cream of the crop

[Hook: CJ Fly]
They just mad, cause I'm the nigga that they wanna be, be, be, be, be
This for all the chicks thats even try to front on me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Middle finger to the niggas makin fun of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
This for all my niggas that be eatin' buns and cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese

[Verse 3: A La $ole]
I said peace to the gods, you know we be cruisin on that highway
Shorty said that Im a big mac, I'll have it my way
Woah, lets not take it so slow, come to the crib and get with a pro
I'm kickin the flows that I pick like a fro
Keep it on swank cause thats how we roll
How we pose, to kill these tracks, I dont even know
My rhymes all dope, white snow for noses
The four for poses, who fake the showbiz
I go nuts, so you niggas roasted
Young King Tut, pharoah to most men
My fly is golden, my eyes is open
Shorty whats the deal, can I get open? I interscope it
I spit so raw, I live in the stars
We chillin on Mars, the kings of New York
Spaceborne Boy,, I shine like bald spots
Came through we on top, you niggas is all shocked
I ball by the way my john stocks, can't front on the kid
So you niggas need to fall back, I rip the cages
My savage greatest, never trust hoes these dimes two faced
If you dont know this back to basics, we run this rap shit
No need for racing, face it, no competition could pace this
Young prophets we bless ya graces, from broke to cakin'
We eating good, Flatbush to the world, you niggas shook
Yo, Fly, come through with another hook
Leave them on death row like a nigga Suge

[Verse 4: CJ Fly]
Trying to be a star so when I'm sad I light
I'm satisfied, they just sad its fly
I might not be the first to class if I
Don't rationalize with the hands of time
Spittin every last new line
Feeling like I'm the last in line
Pay your respect and know that the cash is fine.
Mind racing, feeling like the flash inside
The pro Saucy got it by the gram
Became the man by popular demand
We fried and still poppin in ya/ja pan
You shoulda known that I would have had flows damn
What you waitin for? I'm taking off, if you take too long
It ain't my loss, if we ain't involved, ain't my fault
I don't got time to waste on broads
Bombard every time I drop these bomb bars
These calm chords when I drop they want me like concords
I morph whenever they taking time off,
But when its time for it my suit gone be Tom Ford,
Oh, Lord. Need dope shit, my crews your fix
Caduceus when we choose to shift
These gangters stay dumping just like what we do with clips
I admit my doobie boobie and my doobie do be thick

[Hook][Produced by Bruce LeeKix]

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
Locked down, got the game in shackles
This some new shit from the same old asshole
The cash flow with the track though
Son had to step it up just to raise the stat quo
I'm tellin' 'em I might go bonkers
If my mind ponders from hydroponics, two words: psycho, pompous
But the world doesn't know what a psychopomp is
They still can't explain why birds fly
I can tell when words lie to my third eye
Tryin' to get rich off a single then you blinded
Dumb niggas so one track minded
I tried to be a nice guy
But stars only come alive in the night sky
Fuck a limelight, I already shine bright
And we all wanna pizza the pie, right?
But I'm just tryin' to better my team while gettin' some green
It's the American dream
But this is America, not a miracle
So it can't be as good as it seems
I lost all hope in civil service
I ain't even end up on this mic on purpose
The ringleader of the nitro circus
The real freak-show, so at night you'll surface

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
Either they tell him he's really cool or they ridicule
Silly fools
The pros been dreaming big since middle school
Killin' 'em all not because it's our job
But just to feel involved
Break these bricks down 'til the ceilin' fall
Fuck that, we gon' raise the roof
Choppin' trees and clippin' bud, it's in our roots
Tell you the truth I'm tryin' to feel in the glutes
Know that I ain't playin' when I tell you give me the loot
I been big pimpin' ever since an infant
You a sistren, and I ain't advocating incest
Gave her some now she can't get enough
I know it's sucks, baby you know you want me like a sippy cup
Pops used to pick me up in his pickup truck
I got one shot so I'mma hit it like a sittin' duck
The reload, I just want you to be loved
Just know I'm tryin' to hit it like C-notes
So take a cab to our crib, but know I ain't payin' for your shit
You better see if you could get a lift
Girl I'm throwin' game at you if you catch my drift
And if I pick you up then miss
You don't give me no ass, better pinch in for gas
And maybe you can crash at my crib
We could fuck then act like it was an accident

[Verse 3: Chuck Strangers]
They say Chuck a stranger, how man, everybody know me
We tryin' to get paid, me and all of my homies
So we devised a plan to get these grams
Hoppin' out, guns out, face painted, on some dead president shit
Growin' up that was my favorite flick
Taught me to keep my black ass out the white man's army and shit
Nowadays we spend money on Jays
Quarter bags of haze and fine light-skinned honeys that blaze
Wakin' up, the sun's grazing my face
No more standing in place, gotta keep this shit movin'
If you brick, dog, keep shootin', you gon' get it all net
And if you don't then stay out, man, 'til that sun set
Two seven's what I'm reppin', fresh Jordan's what I step in
She said, ask a question, I'm that nigga she be neckin'
J is too fuckin' dope, never fuckin' come in second, she said
"Wait a second," I said, "Time is money and money is time"
Unless your head game dope, then sweetie you wastin' both
Shout out to niggas that I used to chill with
Man I miss my dogs on some Michael Vick shit
Letters on your door, bitch niggas get evicted
My down chick rollin' swishas
These ain't raps, nigga, they motion pictures[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
S is for the stamina, T is for the talent
And then two E so you don't forget the name Excalibur
Z's the Zip Zinger board that I'm passing you on
You still hoping that I pass the baton
But, I hope you got your cameras on
Plus ain't no passenger surviving when the damage is done
All you cats can fine your damages I'm smashin' the song
Plus your shit is outdated like the calendar's wrong, boy
So fall back, it's all caps, record that
Or you can get your jaw cracked and stomped like floor mats
Plus we're right outside your crib, doormats
With two niggas holding on the back, bra strap
Plus they got the big bangers call it bra strap
And leave your melon leaking like breastfeeding
She said she tempted but she won't let me caress the cleavage
It's the Khan bitch, why you need a better reason?
Class clown, found it funny to correct my teachers
I stand proud, but I never said my pledge allegiance
I'm a veteran, flowing way colder than the seven seas
Of course you be subjected to these heavy breezes
Or check the tag miss, straight STEEZ varsity jacket
Setting me apart from the average
Cause I'm a motherfucking star, asterisk
Fuck friends, I'm in it for the dollars like mavericks
Get paid, get queued, get away
Dashin, take 14th to Manhattan
Skip fashion, I'm still a chick magnet
For women with assets that's thicker than they accents
She say she got her man on a leash
Wear the pants in the relationship with panties beneath
So I proceed to ask if she can stand on her knees
You already know my capital, Capital STEEZ

[Outro]
No, that was too much man
There's some fucking clichés man
Why can't I be just like the other rappers and just fucking rap?
Why I always got to like overdo this shit man?[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Intro]

You mean to tell me that this is not music
I could fucks with this, I could fucks with this

[Verse 1]

It's the mystic, materialistic misfit child of the imperial empress
Ever since birds flew, I been spitting this wittiness
It should be considered a sickness
Can you blame him for making an engravement
And leaving the game the same way that he came in
Say that we came this far from cavemen
How hard could it be to spark fire with a drumstick
If the flows that I'm spitting are far-fetched
Ima' kick it regardless, they listen to nonsense
Digressive korrupt recreation in progress
No question if they raise they arms yet
So tell me can you smell that funk ?
Got nothing but blunts and Mami with the junk in trunk
ProEra be the troublesome bunch
And they gon' remember that name in a couple of months
I got it locked on the indigo ribbon
Feel the rhythm as it's swimming out your stereo system
And Ima' keep on runnin' with it
Yea I got soul, I was brought up by colored women

[Hook x2]

Shouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn
I remember I was on the outside looking in
Keep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin
So pass the pot and let me skillet

You comprehend, Do you comprehend?
I don't think they comprehend
Said Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win
So tell me if it's bongs or hemp

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
The jazzy ambiance keeps me right where I belong
Ever since infinity and beyond
Lyricism isn't appreciated in song
And I won't dumb it down just to be business smart
Your beats cool but it isn't from the heart
And of course, your bars just don't require thought
You hear the lions roar every time I perform
A Deviant, Defiant to the lies of the art
My goal is to try to bring light to the dark
High voltage like lightning, I spark
Vanish, living in the eye of the storm
In a sense it's gone but my mind isn't lost
In reality, vanity is our sanity
Then we lose sight when we're trapped in sanity
Think about the two "I's" In Insanity
And read between the lines, it's more to it actually

[Hook x2]

[Hook x4][Produced by MF DOOM]

[Intro]
Super motherfucking villain, chilling
We out to get these millions
We chilling
Ay, yo, this chick tried to tell him
"Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the pain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days"
She told me
"You're the perfect one
Me and you, forever we'll be"
I told her
"I will rock this microphone always"

[Verse 1]
"Ay,yo, Steez, what you cookin' up?"
Niggas wanted trouble with the troublesome
So I went ahead and doubled up
Momma always said you better hustle if you wanted lunch
Ain't no such thing as runner up
From M-I-A to D-O-A it's no games but I know my C-D gon play
And with everything I do it P-E all day
That's D-O-P-E so them fiends gon' pay, shit
Son is always outshining 'em
The high from the squadron that was hidin in the lion's den
Sleepin, countin' all the sheep to start a riot but
They ain't even know I had a shot like silencers
You get the mental picture
World cup flow, I can't kick it with ya
Naw, I'm kidding with ya
Ask your little sister
J Steez on this grind like benefactors
It's the Steyraz comin' through your 8-track
Play that, but keep it low key- a flat
Lay flat when the war comes
Aesop Rock meets swing jazz and gym class
So PE be them supervillains
Groupies flockin' at the concerts just to boost they image
So you spent it on these stupid women
Out buying whores shoes like true religion and superstition
Niggas wanna picture me gone
Like when Biggie went to war with Mr. Shakur
Lyrical spawn with a little twisted Jigga and Nas
But I was born to deliver like umbilical cords
Fuck what you heard, this is an eargasm
Classic, feel-good rapping
Magnum saliva like salvia I'm spittin' up spasms
Based God trippin' off acid[Produced by Joey Bada$$]

[Verse 1]
I'm green and inexperienced, dreamin' 'bout that chariots
Stay sparked and trade cards, he know that they be cheering it
On, I'm feeling grown when I spray my cologne
Got a mind of my own, but time's ticking too long
And I got a plan to restore the game
This shit was looking quite critical right before we came
Co and cane flow in that novacane for your open veins
All we need is something medicinal, torch the flame
Third rail skippin' over missin' track
Soundin' like the kicks and claps that filled the gaps for missing tracks
The third kind been real, we just missin' Jack
Food for thought, but I tossed the scraps in a doggy bag
Rehearsin' verses in my head, no iPod
Gave my life to Ja and still can't find a job
So what I'm grindin' for, to put these new Nikes on
Or to hide the scars from the eyes of God

[Hook x2]
Is there heaven for us hip-hop heathens
Big Pop and Pac, even Eazy had 'em leanin'
We all children lookin' for a reason
What do you believe in, betrayal, treason?

[Bridge x2]
I'm out for dead presidency
I'm out for dead presidency
I'm out for dead presidency
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents that represent me

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, STEEZ, lemme send you a track
I've been a fan for a while and I appreciate you hittin' me back
Cause me and you, we like similar cats, just tryin' to get on the map
And I would love to work with you and Jakk
But I'm afraid it's not as simple as that
Cause the symphonies and melodies
Haven't been havin' the same chemistry
The distance fact is only addin' on stress
And it's hard for me to live up to what you expect from me
The yellow tape was a warnin' sign
It's hard to cut straight to the chase without a dotted line
And if I made that the bottom line
Then I guess the Khan hit rock bottom about a thousand times
Some people like to compromise for the dollar sign, but I had my mind aside
I told Jakk from the get that I'mma ride or die
And I'd rather die by homicide
Instead of goin' out without a pride

[Hook & Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Presidents that represent me up on some G shit
Tryin' to stay afloat so long they got me seasick
It's been a good minute since we kicked it
And I'm still hopin' that you come home for a weekend
So I could kick it like a kid again
I was all constructive like criticism and Timbaland
But I remember back in the days
When we was goin' through that Torch and Excalibur phase

[Hook & Bridge]
