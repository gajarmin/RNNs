[Steele]
I walk around town with the pound strapped down to my side
No fronting just in case I gotta smoke something
Round here heads don't act their age
You might be another dead bwoy pon rage
Enter the cipher with your lighter
L's are ready, prepare for another all nighter
But keep a watch for the cops cos they rock Glocks
Coming on the block trying to rock knots
Pigs be acting like they bigger than us niggas from the streets
Cos we stalk mad deep and dem walk beats
I guess dem hold a grudge cos I won't budge
Playing tough, staring down the judge with my hands cuffed
Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear
Awww yeah now I'm up outta here
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it cos I'm brown or is it because I'm from Bucktown?

[Hook]
Bucktown!
Home of the original gun clappers
(Repeat x8)

[Tek]
Got five MC that wanna contest we
Got your nooses ready hanging over the trees
Bring on your sounds and get drowned by my massive
Kill you batty boy and hold your lover for hostage
Knock knock niggy-knock that's four shots empty
On a violator that was sent out to get me
I'm tore up from the floor up and everything's black
But still I'm on point ready to buck, ain't nothing sweet, jack
Bucktown, I represent it on the love love
Deeply rooted from my Timbs to my dick above
Don't sweat the bulge coming from my hip
Grip what you get hit when I let my tool click
Nowhere to run, ambush lurks in the dark
Heltah Skeltah smirks while you're getting torn apart
Here come the rude bwoys with the ganja plants
Smif-N-Wessun generals of the Boot Camp

[Hook]

[Tek]
Another murderer, just another prankster
Rude bwoy dead cause him thought him was a gangster
Tried to live the life of a hood from the streets
Test the wrong dread, now the man returns to sleep
Mr Ripper I lurk in the Stuy
Twist up the ganja when I want to get high
With my bredren, a buddah session, learn your lesson
Or get blasted by Mr Smif or Mr Wessun

[Steele]
Bucktown's everywhere I swear
It's clear to me, you feel the weed, now I really see
Nightfall round the way
Original heads come out to play
Puff herb, break day
It's just a regular, everyday state of being I
Mind holds the weight, rhymes free the mind in time
I find reality follows me where I roam
360 degrees back home in...

[Hook][Steele]
Early to rise, so wake way before daybreak
Meditating on the steps I take
I realize there's a lot at stake
So I enterprise while trying to stack papes
But I recognize that it ain't easy
So I organize with my P.N.C

[Tek]
From day break to dusk dawn
I stand strong on my own two
Give praises to Jah before manuvering through
My steps towards improvements
Meet up with my ese, put him up on the movements
I maintains likes greenbacks and such
We’re gonna make it happen, just the two of us

[Hook: Steele&Tek]
All heads realize (wrekonize)
Real heads on the rise (wrekonize)
You better wrekonize
(Repeat x4)

[Tek]
I live the life of a entertainer
Stress bringer, grams of get right hides pounds of anger
And worries of success down the line
Living life to the fullest in that space and time
I'm coping with me and my habits
Copping that coke over enhance the cabbage
Timbs all seasons for ass kicking reasons
Never know when you catch a spy commiting treason

[Steele]
I know what you mean son
I’ve seen some blind, some deaf, some dumb
Whichever one chooses to follow the other one loses
Due to mass confusion caused by fast illusion
Showing and proving, it’s not just a phrase that we using
It’s the way of life when you keep it moving
Soon when, you get new then
You be tuned in to get ready to move in position

[Hook]

[Steele&Tek]

I shine, you shine, in this day and time
We maintain the same frame of mind
The elevation, spark it up son
Yo, start the circulation
360 degrees in rotation
Stimulation, as a herb as my physical creation
Slipping to a hallucination
Situations got me thinking about my life seriously
Keep it real continuously
Before I slip into blackness I prepare for combat
Protect my dome cause that’s where my home’s at
Crack my windows inhale as the mist flows
Build up my mental, construct on my physical
Spreading love to my P.N.C. state to state
And heads on lock holding it down behind the gate
Put some scribes in the mail son
Or hit me on the horn
Smif n’ Wessun hold it down
We see you when you reach home

[Hook][Sound bwoy dialogue]

[Top Dog]
Boom bye bye in a batty bwoy head
The shottie fly now the batty guy lie dead
Two shots dead to him chin
Enemy or friend, fake the funk I put the junk to an end
Now who the rude bwoy want come test Dog
I find his family to I.D. him in the morgue
I bet you never thought I bust lead
Surprise I'm a fortified blunt head just like a dread

[Tek]
You can't test the champion sound, you getting bucked down
Recognize the Boot Camp Clik outta Bucktown
Gun thirsty little bastard, always blasted
From the sacks of chocolate off Mother Gaston
You say you number one wicked selector
I say you punnany and I'll wet ya
Keep the bull 'fore I pull this here trigger
Cause you don't wanna test me when I'm tipsy off the liquor
Like the punk they called McGirt, got his feelings hurt
Showed his true colors had to yank up his skirt
Now he's in misery, trying to cop a plea
Lead to him head from Gunn Clappa Numba Three, see
Lick off a shot you no dick rider
Lick a shot punnany not gunfire

[Steele]
Now everybody wanna be Don Gorgon
All around New York niggas be talking but we be stalking
In the dark's when the guns start barking
But in the day be wary of where you be walking

[Sound bwoy dialogue]

[Steele]
Me nah sex me rough like the wicked youth in me
That motherfucker that be bugging off of truth we see
Original criminal running town
Crime pays, that's what I practise so act if
You want get blasted by my nine shot
Come around my block, find a nice spot in the pine box
Murderer, batty bwoy killer
Colin Powell feeler, we 'bout to get iller

[Tek]
Sound bwoy, you got nuff reason to worry
Coming with my troops, we about to bury
Better pack your dubs and move in a hurry
Ease off, seen
Looking at my pager it's about that time
To load up the nine and do my daily crime
Warriors, conquerors, the man before ya
Mr Ripper aka the enemy killer
My man with the weed is my man indeed
And all you sucky-ducky niggas catch knots with speed

[Sound bwoy dialogue]

[Tek]
Lord some bwoy gwan get dead tonight, duke
As I retrieve the .25 from my Timb boots
Target pon sight, trigger pon cock
Adjust your pupils to see a dead bwoy walk
Nuff pussyhole gwan die this year
Here comes the Boot Camp slide it to the rear

[Starang Wondah]
Starang coming like a hurricane licking shots
More untouchable than niggas with the chicken pox
So, emcees get lifted when I'm spliffted
Nigga guard your grill cos Louieville packs the biscuit
In the session, Smif-N-Wessun, OGC
Gunn Clappa Numba One with with my nigga D-O-G

[Steele]
We bring the realness, feel this
Boom as Black Moon reveal this
We come to let you know what the deal is
Straight up we serve justice
So if you can't be trusted may you return where the dust is

[Sound bwoy dialogue][Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in "Who's The Man"
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a Rasta[Intro - 2Pac]
Stand in formation, my motherfuckin real troopers
Let's do it like soldiers - all and together now!
Ready? Hell yeah, y'all niggas better get ready
No retreat, no surrender, death before dishonor motherfucker!
Do it to 'em, c'mon never die thuggin, uhh - YES YES YES
Say what? (Eastside, Westside ride) Where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at?!
Hehehe, send cases to the drug dealer
Real thugs, where ya at? You motherfuckin home
Do it to 'em, do it to 'em
They love the way we do it to 'em, we do it to 'em

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas, now playa what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleedin with three strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin, from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin' five rounds
My forty-five got my fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when our Glock spits
All hail, out on bail, raps the 2Pacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug Niggas never left the boot camp

[Verse Two: Cocoa Brovaz]
(Tek)
They called us for assignment, one of the squad's finest
Skills in guerilla warfare and blessed with refinement
My rap sheet, contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black Smif-N-Wessun
Puttin likkle yout's in a military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovaz 'pon de borderline
Test de sound and ye dead same ti-ime

(Steele)
Man to man, I'm facin the Devil with a plan
Judo stance, first glance, I'm makin my advance
Animal instincts, intelligence of an assassin
Masked men, ninjas that surround me, ready to attack
I react swiftly, what father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the method, stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin like it's closin in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

[Verse Three: Buckshot]
Picture bein put in a position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Why try if ya body lie
By the block true soldier mentality, this is how we rock and roll
(This is how we ride)

[Boot Camp Clik]
Stick and move, time to show 'em how to make a move
Or get moved on, let's see who strong

[Verse Four: Cocoa Brovaz]
(Tek)
In the gaze of the strange, where nothin stays the same
Where new faces come through with similar game
Now who you thought was them, really ain't
They catchin deja vus of the game people play
It's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
You slippin and trippin 'stead of bobbin and dippin
But never let this world of stress get the best of me
Takin breathin techniques, slay you with Tai-Chi

(Steele)
What does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake, elimination I'm facin destruction
Outlawed, so I +Duck+ and +Down+
Fo'-fo' is bustin, no one to trust in
Rushin to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole him
No swine I'm a soldier, soldier I control mine
Time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

[Verse Five: Buckshot]
One way out, this black hole
For this black soul, shit is outta control
I'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world I'm enterin
And my face is sentencin' for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin' weed
Cause my moms used to smoke back in the 70's
Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop G's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with 'Pac
Got all y'all niggas shocked
You didn't think Boot Camp Clik would link, with a Outlaw mind?
If you do you press rewind
And you can peep guerilla tactics in every line

[Outro: 2Pac]
Yeah, and this is how we do it!
Where my real thugs, where they at?
Let me, see my real thugs, now where ya at?
Won'tcha, see my real thugs, where ya at?
Let me, see my real thugs, where ya at now?
Where my real thugs, let me see, where ya at?
Tell me where my real thugs gotsta see, where ya at?
Where's my soldiers - where ya at?
Where my, real soldiers - where ya at?
Where my soldiers at; where ya at, where ya at?
Get yo' strap my nigga; where ya at, where ya at?
Where my soldiers at; where ya at, what ya at?
Getcha, thug niggas where ya at, witcha strap?
Where my soldiers at, where my true thug niggas
No longer drug dealers cause we now, thug niggas
Where my soldiers at, no longer drug dealers
Cause we now, thug niggas, let me, where my
Where my soldiers at? Put your pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at? Put yo' guns up
Tell me where my soldiers at? Put yo' pistols in the air
Where my, SOLDIERS, my true thug ROLLERS
Yes, it just doesn't quit, YES!
This is that real hip-hop shit YES!
Fuck what you heard
From the ghetto to the 'burbs, know we meant, every word
Where my SOLDIERS? Where my soldiers at
Where my SOLDIERS? Where my soldiers at
Put yo' hand on the pistol, put yo' pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at? Where my soldiers at?
Where my SOLDIERS? Where my soldiers at
Where my SOLDIERS? Where my soldiers at
When Bob Dole and Delores Tucker wanna know
Where my soldiers at, GO VOTE!![Smif N Wessun]
This is how we do...everyday all day everyday
This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif and Wess don't play

This is how we do...everyday all day everyday
This is how we do, this is how we do
Click click click...

I shine, you shine (repeat 5x)

And this day and time
We maintain the same frame of mind
Elevation, spark an L
Yo Start the circulation, 360 degrees of rotation
Stimulation, as the earth rests my physical creation
Slip into a hallucination
Situations, got me thinking about my life seriously
Keep it real continuously

Before I slip into blackness I prepare for combat
Protect my dome cause that's where my home's at
Crack my windows inhale as the mist blows
Build up my mental destruct all my missed boos

Spread love to my brooklyn crew (who be you?)
Bad boys, Smif N Wessun, comin' thru
Tek and Steele
Check your steer
Travelin' through the battle and
Handin' all that is challengin' to the very end

This is how we do
This is how we do, everyday all day
This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif N Wess we don't play

This is how we do, this is how we do
When we get down with Mary J
This is how we do, this is how we do
Click click click...

[Mary J. Blige-Hook 2x]
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I Love you, I Love you

[Mary J. Blige]
[Verse 1]
When I found out you were leaving me
I couldn't sleep thinkin' about
All the things that we've been through
Now all I want to do is tell you that I miss you
So much (you know I really really miss you)

Chorus 2x

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm on my own
I know, that in time I'll find somebody
That'll treat me better than you
So I go on my own, without you
But I still love you (you know i'll never live without you)

Chorus 2x

[Bridge]
I wish you change your way soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand your love
But now all we have is memories

Chorus 2x

[Smif N Wessun]
Hip Hop, sex out in the park
Blaze an L, raisin' hell till the day I dark

Got me Reminiscing back like Mary J
When I sit back and peep the game people play

To High to get over
Cause I'm rollin' through life like a soldier
Holdin' the weight of my fate on my shoulder

Blazin' the trees
With my Duck Down family
P-N-C-One L-O-V-E

You know how we do, this is how we do
Everyday all day
This is how we do when we get down with Mary J

This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif N Wess we don't play

This is how we do, when we break play
Click click click...It's Tek man niggas can't tell me shit

[Tek]
I do what I do, like I do for the hood
Pop tools, pop jewels burn backboards
Slay DJs who think they untouchable
Renegade, never been afraid
MCs get it too
The moral of the story is this
I used to say get off
But this time, suck my dick
I'm from BK, home of B.I.G. and Aaliyah
Watch how the pound of the four-fifth leave ya

[Sean Price]
I guess I'm back where I started
Openin' up for Buckshot and just rappin' retarded
I hate the life that I'm livin'; I need it
Don't believe me, ask my wife and my children
See I'm back on the street, packin' the heat
Royalty checks equal to crack in the street
Niggas like, fuck crack, Ruck, rap to the beat
I'm like, All right I'll be back in a week: listen
From day one I had bad start
To eat, Moms stole meat out of Pathmark
I ain't playin'
I went from depraved in the street to blazin' heat
To blazin' heat to Hazen Street
Did a couple of months and came home
Thought about what I did
Did the same shit, I ain't come back home
Niggas like "Why you done that homes?"
"I don't know ..(shit..fuck)..I don't know"

[Buckshot]
The saga continues
The motherfuckin' drama continues
Buck brought bomb to ya interview
And blew the main topic
Whats up with Boot Camp Clik son?
They ain't knockin'
They ain't hot 'n' ain't droppin' the now topics
But listen nigga, this is how I pop shit
I don't mean Moet corks
When the poet talks
Every line leave you blind when the mind get lost
Rhymes are enforced with action
Cause everybody looking like
Is they slackin'? Are they back in? What's crackin'?
Nigga, I'm hip hop like the backspinnin'
Never change the fact that I did it back then

[Steele]
Way before this all began
Back when I wasn't rappin', I was scrappin' for ends
Stopped crime, started rhymin'
Knapsack and my Tims
Chart climbin', ya'll comp can get a gat to ya ribs
There's a thin between what I rep and I live
When you violate mine I'm getting back at you kid
Don't let it get to the gun clappin' and shit
Plastic wrap, back smack you in the back of ya wig
I, make it so you won't get back to ya crib
Break your wrist, never scratch, you never wreck it again
Take a risk, never steal from Steele and Tek again
Take the fifth, cock the hammer, let it rest on your chin
My dudes destine to win
Fuck ya thoughts
Wanna brawl dog my team love the sports
And so ya thinking I'm "The One" like Jet Li
Test me Steele will leave you resting

[Top Dog]
I can't take this
Blood boiling pressure rising
Open my eye's and we narrowed down to seven guys
And so you ask about the god D.O
I'm top notch, holdin' my spot, gun by my crotch
You think not I'm respected and feared around here
And so, I must prepared around here
You know everything that glitters ain't gold
You ho getting pimped by niggas you don't know
That's whoa, watch out for cars that move slow
Windows low
I was taught by the best to do the one
And gain control of this game
And be sold not told
And So
I'mma rep for B-double-O-T C-A-M-P
Cause I'm Top D-O-G, number three
You know me from the O.G.C.s
That blow trees
Fuckin' with them Cocoa B's
(We OGs) Fuckin' with them Cocoa B's ...

[Buckshot]
Fuck everything you been told
Shit like Buck ain't never went gold
He never have a platinum hit
He on that underground backpack rappin' shit

[Tek]
If you for real than you know the deal

[Steele]
I do or I die, and I never ran never will

[Sean Price]
And Sooo you still peepin' my words
Words that get niggas locked up in 73rd

[Top Dog]
You forgot who we are?
Have you lost all your respect for my squad ....?[Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain

Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

Did a couple of months and came home
Thought about what I did
Did the same shit, I ain't come back home
Niggas like "Why you done that homes?"
"I don't know ..(shit..fuck)..I don't know"

[Buckshot]
The saga continues
The motherfuckin' drama continues
Buck brought bomb to ya interview
And blew the main topic
Whats up with Boot Camp Clik son?
They ain't knockin'
They ain't hot 'n' ain't droppin' the now topics
But listen nigga, this is how I pop shit
I don't mean Moet corks
When the poet talks
Every line leave you blind when the mind get lost
Rhymes are enforced with action
Cause everybody looking like
Is they slackin'? Are they back in? What's crackin'?
Nigga, I'm hip hop like the backspinnin'
Never change the fact that I did it back then

[Steele]
Way before this all began
Back when I wasn't rappin', I was scrappin' for ends
Stopped crime, started rhymin'
Knapsack and my Tims
Chart climbin', ya'll comp can get a gat to ya ribs
There's a thin between what I rep and I live
When you violate mine I'm getting back at you kid
Don't let it get to the gun clappin' and shit
Plastic wrap, back smack you in the back of ya wig
I, make it so you won't get back to ya crib
Break your wrist, never scratch, you never wreck it again
Take a risk, never steal from Steele and Tek again
Take the fifth, cock the hammer, let it rest on your chin
My dudes destine to win
Fuck ya thoughts
Wanna brawl dog my team love the sports
And so ya thinking I'm "The One" like Jet Li
Test me Steele will leave you resting

[Top Dog]
I can't take this
Blood boiling pressure rising
Open my eye's and we narrowed down to seven guys
And so you ask about the god D.O
I'm top notch, holdin' my spot, gun by my crotch
You think not I'm respected and feared around here
And so, I must prepared around here
You know everything that glitters ain't gold
You ho getting pimped by niggas you don't know
That's whoa, watch out for cars that move slow
Windows low
I was taught by the best to do the one
And gain control of this game
And be sold not told
And So
I'mma rep for B-double-O-T C-A-M-P
Cause I'm Top D-O-G, number three
You know me from the O.G.C.s
That blow trees
Fuckin' with them Cocoa B's
(We OGs) Fuckin' with them Cocoa B's ...

[Buckshot]
Fuck everything you been told
Shit like Buck ain't never went gold
He never have a platinum hit
He on that underground backpack rappin' shit

[Tek]
If you for real than you know the deal

[Steele]
I do or I die, and I never ran never will

[Sean Price]
And Sooo you still peepin' my words
Words that get niggas locked up in 73rd

[Top Dog]
You forgot who we are?
Have you lost all your respect for my squad ....?Verse 1

I was born son of Barbara, sibling of james
Had a twin but he lived for eighteen days
Left his grade of his it's wavy here
One died in ways I ?? fairly here
They said my first word was mother
I'm the eigth of nine brothers
Five sisters, three years behind each other
I'm already thuggin', cursin' squeezin' titties
And I ain't even five yet I'm still a pygmy

Verse 2

I was brought up in the county of kings, first of four
One went to heaven early, natural cause
Only sister that I had passed when I was small
Still hurts, It's kinda hard to discuss with y'all
PS-150 where we used to ball, stick ball, soop hall, we played it all
Brownsville wrecksing where the game be rough
Vandycke, in the hall where my mother gassed him with stalls

Hook

It's like days is shorter nights is gettin' longer
I know whatever don't kill me only makes me stronger
I'm from the ghetto so I know about pain and hunger
Got niggas in the system doing foot for numbers
Just for livin' life they had to sacrifice
So who am I to try to judge n' say it's wrong or right
All that I can do is ball and pray this song is tight
Live the day for those who never made it through the night

Verse 3

St Marks Ave, between vanderbilt and clawson
Ps-9 me and my ree slap boxin'
School yard bully used to rock with little noonies
Big boss killed himself death was introduced to me
Then my brother junior drowns in the pool
?? temperament, ?? cloud won't move
Now let's talk about me and my knock out punch
I'm servin' as a teen i'll be back in 18 months

Verse 4

When I was young D sect put me on to the game
It's only one megatron and we reppin' his name
Seth low houses was the place I was raised
From the fourteenth foor the hood looked like a maze
From my room window, I can see the empire state
When My moms cooked fish, I cleaned the entire plate
Seemed like everyday, my pops got on my case
A niggas life wasn't rosy when my mind got strained

Hook

Verse 5

High school GQ, not me
It's champ??, black boots, fatigues
40oz Old E, skunk weed
Violate like you sweet, ya bleed
Just lost my first chick got hit by a bus
Found out she was pregnant continuing us
What about luck I'm boxing top of my weight
I'm rhymin, doin' college one gotta wait
All of the weight I carry for my nephews and fam'
But the roads that I take make me the man that I am

Verse 6

I heared love lasts forever that's what grandma said
2Pac got murdered, plus Big Poppa dead
I can't lie I never thought i'd be a rapper kid
I can't deny this industry be on some ugly shit
I lost a lot of close friends that I was brothers with
We still brothers, but some brothers I don't be fuckin' with

Hook[Hook 2x: Buckshot (Ruste Juxx)]
BK all day (all day, nigga)
We spray ya'll way (pop and you lay down)
So don't walk our way (get from round these parts)
Cuz we puff our way (fuck around and get shot in the dark)

[Ruste Juxx]
Aiyyo, recognize my Boot Camp Clik out of N.Y
Living legends in the game, niggas been fly
Think back, when we first entered the stage
Let that Brook-nam rhythm and rage out the cage, nigga
How Many MC's screaming U Da Man
Buck 'em Down with that Black Smif-N-Wessun in my hand
Champion hood fatigues, all black chuckers
Where the soldiers walk tight than a million muthafuckas
I don't give a fuck, I've been jumped a hundred times
Stabbed alot of niggas, committed a hundred crimes
Bitch, I ain't buying that, give you a raincheck
Gladly pay you Tuesday for seriously brain that
Sound Bwoy Bureill, chi-chi man funeral
Headz Ain't Redee ain't ready to shoot, niggas salute
The elite generals of the street and gun play
Ruste Juxx, Boot Camp, BK all day

[Hook]

[5 Ft.]
The streets are hard knocks, where police swarm blocks
Where every other soldier keep they firing arm cocked
Gorillas on that grind, it's a Brooklyn state of mind
Make money, take money, a famous motto of mine
When you find the hardest nigga, tucking in they shine
They know the rules'll get 'em, if you blink one time
So it shouldn't be a mystery, the man that gangsta history
The general, the fever, blaze ya out another victory
All you niggas running ya mouth, and don't mean shit to me
Leaving your body numb like Pepsi Twist mixed with the Hennessey
Got a shell for every single one of my enemies
Brooklyn pumping blood through my heart, to the death of me

[Buckshot]
This is the original Bucktown bullies
From the same block where they bust shots at police
Like, blow, everywhere I look
Somebody shook when they lost in the city of Brook'
And umm, ya'll know every block is danger
If you not on point, somebody came up
Fuck the stranger, beware of your neighbor
Cuz when he broke, that's when he change up to bring the banger
Finger on the trigger, as we look closely
At the car when he ride slow, cuz we don't really know pa
Ya'll know how we do around here
Who we screw around here, if we new around here

[Hook]

[Tek]
You hear my gun ball go in, shotgun toting
Heavy pitch blowing, nigga back the fuck up
Who you know fucking with the U.G.P
Underground prince of hood H.O.P
I'm a world wide hustler, Brooklyn gangsta
When the east is in the house, "OH MY GOD" danger
Did too much dirt to wipe my hands clean
And I love new money, so fresh and green
See the borough I'm from, we be on that bullshit
Fuck ya baby mama, hit you up quick
We play with whole bricks, nigga, get that weight
Respect my grind, 718, the great

[Steele]
Use caution when you crossing that Brooklyn Bridge
Don't get caught up out here with them Crooklyn kids
Real gritty, that's just how we live
Fitted '59 fitties over Scarface grills
Bedstuy, to the East, to the 'Ville
We get hype when we eat, give you fights for the thrills
We in the house, in the place getting field
Fights live through the breakout, the chain, get peeled
Girlfriends bang out with airbrushed nailis
Snatch your bitch weave right out
Her hair ain't real
You from the projects, your man ain't real
Getting house forced objects, it's like that? Yeah

[Hook]

[Rock]
Fuck your gun talk, play 'No Doubt', you 'Gwen' 'don't speak'
You ain't shooting nothing but air, you Nintendo Wii
Fuck the industry and fuck being in those streets
I'm from the low down, you can't even go in those peeps
It's an animal hunt, think I damage your hunt, your man in the front
Get snap shot without a camera, son
The animal's hunting the animals, the pigs is the worstest
Well, not to the rats and the bird niggas
Fuck them, they can't stop you from getting your food ate, they just
Make it hard to eat like toothaches
Pause, difficult to eat like toothaches
I be having myself and I like shoelace

[Hook 2x][Verse 1: Tek]
Here we go, break of day, with a mad lye session
Down in Bucktown it's Black Moon, and Smif-N-Wessun
Pick up the pace cause we're right behind ya black
The punk got X-amount of shots, take one to your back
BOO-YAA-KAA!!! Mr. Ripper did the shooting
Cops heard the shots, shit's hot cause they're pursuing
But it's my stomping ground where herds get blown down
Think I'm getting caught by beasts you's a damn clown
Check the drums of death as I break what's left
Of your face, cuz you're sellin out the rap race
Your family cried as your body lies in its casket
I keep a black Smith-and-Wessun in my polo jacket
Sixteen shots, for all you hardrocks
And if your bitch is a dime she can get the cock
Straight up and down, we two terrible toughies
The Vickster hit your pockets then I made your eyes puffy
What pussy? Better drop your mic and get to steppin
Before you're face to face with a black Smith-and-Wessun

[Hook][x4]
Load the clip, bust lead to the head
The nappy head dread, Buckshot and Baldhead

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
Real niggas represent and don't die
Never dead like I said all we fuckin do is multiply
I puff a mad bag of buddha
Niggas be like "Yo who the shorty?"
I'm bustin niggas with my six-shooter
I get so much pussy my dick be in stitches
Red-boned or even fucked-up black Zulu bitches
What? This lil nigga is a mad stalker
Brooklyn, New York will grab the leash around your neck and then I walk ya
If youse a bigger nigga bigger niggas get bucked
Cuz I'm the Buck and I don't give a fuck my dick you can suck
Buck is a killer, thrill a nigga like Manilla
I'm small but strong like that fucking gorilla
A crazy-ass nigga puttin Brooklyn on the map
I never gave a fuck, I never give a fuck, cuz I'm all that
I take no shit see, givin the Buck fifty
I even blew your bitch cuz your man tried to stick me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Steele]
Ahh shit, a personality split
And I'm bout to flip with my nigga pull the trigger let the Glock spit
A little bad-ass shorty with no remorse
I kill forties and quarts remains on stage so who the boss?
Another boom blew up the scene
Throughout the planet, get green, now I got sticky mean with my tag team
G want a clip thinkin I'm takin this the underground moves
There ain't no more fakin if you're fakin I'm bakin it
Straight up and down, nuff respect to Bucktown
Home of the chrome, where I roam, not givin a FUCK now
Damn, just when you thought it was safe
To come out, with a rhyme, I got the nine to your face
Boom, hooked up with Black Moon, now it's on for real
So I pack more steel lookin for the kill
Hope you're not the picture on my scope, cuz the dread'll
Pump lead, from the black Smith-and-Wessun, nuff said

[Hook]*sample repeated in background during entire song*

"Guess who's the Black Trump" [Raekwon]

[Steele] (Raekwon)
I had to get some real professionals for the job, son
(Numerous cats) Word up
(That's right) Official niggas word up
(This is what you call ?) Straight blazin through what
Raise the roof is what we came to do (Like hash browns)
Blazin through, blazin through (Pass that African black gold over here)
Raise the roof is what we came to do
Blazin through, blazin through (You know how we rock)
Raise the roof is what we came to do (Smiff-N-Wess-N-Lex set up shop)

[Steele]
Attack mode, time to strike like a cobra
Poisonous venom into your system killin you slower
Than niggas with blowers to your jugular
My brother's keeper but I put my brother to sleep
If my brother try to creep up
You know my son, show respect when I'm rockin the podium
Steam-rollin on niggas, my team straight blowin em
Got em Throwin they Gunz In The Air like Onyx
Chef and Smiff-N-Wessun crime shit, New York's finest

[Raekwon]
Let me warn y'all killas upstairs
I seen all y'all, heavy like fuck, thinkin my niggas might flaw y'all
Blow ya ammo, Shallah seen the god fly commando
Handle, gun on my leg, blow his hand off
I'm lookin at you why, like "fuck, you probably think I'm high"
Seems luck, chain around my neck, bought it from E-gypt
Me what? Hennesy drink, mahogany guns, we treesed up
Come out your shirt, buckle knees-up
This Casablanca rap nigga throw some cheese up
Let's poly, slow-mo status, bring the keys up
Wonderin, runners is lookin mighty fees'd up
Right stupid, FBI sell em ? guns

[Tek]
Make this money, niggas hold up guns
Armed full of licks, plus your dick, drop your ones
Baby need new shoes and a outfit
I see you stick-up kids, you came wit the dick lick
You see my set of twin-hitmen from Bushwick?
Two chicks wit the twenty-two tecs, bitch
You heard about em
Now open up the circle so the dice can breathe
Pay you double, if you triple, if you push you pay me

[Hook]
Gotta poly wit ya crew to stack ya loot up
Get your weight up, big up, pull ya boots up
If you step into the club wit your guns up
If the tension's on your mind then raise the roof up
You gotta keep it in the fam, stack ya loot up
Get your weight up, big up, pull ya boots up
When you step into the club wit ya guns up
If the tension's on your mind, then raise the roof up
Raise the roof up, raise the roof up
Never before we came to raise the roof up
Raise the roof up, raise the roof up
Still in all we came to raise the roof up

[R] Minolta flash
[S] Gun in the stash
[T] Rollin for mo' hash
[R] Tek, why you slap fire out em, hold fast
[T] These niggas gotta pay the hard way
[All] Three the hard way
[R] Allah swingin on em like a San Diego Padre

[Steele]
You heard what the god say, let's start this
Professional marksman, swimmin like killa sharks
We lethal and heartless
On point like a dart, bitch
Bomb your camp if you want this
Connect wit convicts on some Don shit

[Tek]
And spread the camouflage cats to get the money in Stat
Go to war like Saadam if he pushes you that
Keep his movements discreet when he out in the streets
Had to stash built to high heat for those who creep

[Steele]
Ha, peep the ghetto bastards
Run in your crib like two masked men
I run wit a Tek, and we ain't askin, we blastin
Chef brought the extra cannon from Staten
Rhyme official live broadcastin, makin it happen

[Tek]
You gotta make power moves, black guns and cash rules
Hold my eight straight cuz I been payin dues
Wave king from way back tryin to make a mill stack
Miami money cats that leave you layin down flat

Chorus
*Replace "When you step into the club wit ya guns up"
W/ "When you layin in the cut wit ya guns tucked"*

*Steele chanting "raise the roof up*

[Raekwon]
It's on again
Word up, put your hands down
Word up, this shit is multi
Y'all gonna see it, word up
Smiff, Wess, Lex
*Steele chanting "the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire*
From the projects, phony projects
Next!
(We don't need no water, like the Cocoa B's burn)
(Gotta poly wit your crew to stack ya loot up)
(Get ya weight up, big up, pull ya boots up)
(When you step into the club wit the guns up)
(If the tension's on your mind, then raise the roof up)[Steele]
I got so much trouble on my mind, refuse to lose
But sometimes the flesh get's weak
And I regret the decision I choose
But I'm not trying to sing the blues
Cause life goes on, remembering the verse
Nitty showed me a song
Kept me calm for a minute though
Got me mellow when Juda blaze the Cocoa
But in the back of my mind I still know
I still got a job to do, for real yo
Give thanks for the meal, it's time to peel though
Lick em off, soon be back to build yo
On the bricks side where it's real for sho
But what's really buried deep in the mind, no one knows
My peeps keep me grounded, so my head don't blow
It's a struggle but the more I smoke the more my mind flow

Losing my mind, tryin' to stay high
Everybody fuckin wit me, cuz they know I keep a pound of trees
Cuz I gotta maintain in me
But I'm losing my mind, tryin to stay high
Gotta link with my P.N.C

[Tek]
It's the life of my man who lived for the root of all evil
I can't knock him though, cause we was once consider peoples
We broke bread at the same chicks crib
Two ribs we just roughed up
Gums we just brushed up
I burglarized my first joint playin with stack money
Who motto was "I die for it" quote from Stack Money
Head Capo, cause shots round the Big Apple
Ain't never been no punk, my guns bust directly at you
Would of sworn he was the thoroughest, came through in the prettiest
Big boy Benz, 500-S series
Bumpin' "For the Love of Money" by the group the O'Jays
Spotted the half smoked Philly comin' out the ashtray
I didn't even know, just knew my man Mr. Brown
And I've been linkin up with dunn for 3 months now
Looked at my kiko asked him, which spot he cocked
He returned the death stare, eyes full of blood shot
Try to block it wit a chuckle, hit that shit nigga fuck you
Buck him, pull my coat, just huff on the dust too
Like it's cool to be smokin' on the oolahs
Won't hit the spliff less I see you twist up the buddhas

[Steele]
I'm losing my mind, rollin' my dime
Frame of mind, tryin' to lace my weed
That's a muthafuckin' friend I don't need

[Buckshot]
It's a shame, it's a shame, how you blamed your man
For some shit that you been through, but you don't understand
It's a price to pay, the price when you play the game
If you get up in the game, get hit up in the game
I seen niggas snitch just to come home quick
Money came home, but he got hit
In the bubble whip, with the system in it
One shot, fire two, then burst
Shit that's what happen when you thrust
You think you comin home, but you meetin chrome
You really thought you had the throne, cuz you was the bone
On the block, as the bomb rock, now you
Under a rock, so the money stop
Didn't know the rules of the game so you plan flop
Niggas seein' a vision, tryin' to make it to the top

[Steele]
Now I'm losin my mind, gotta take time
If I wanna roll that weed, cuz you know I gotta roll it in the leaf
Can't fuck with no phillies
I'm losin my mind, smokin my dime
On the lo lo from these
Cuz you know them niggas lookin for me
From some shit back from the 80's
I'm losin my mind, fuckin wit ya niggas one time...

[Unkown]
I just want all yall to keep the faith, and never lose it
Coming straight from the heart
Cause in this game, it's a struggle
But I just want you to keep strong, and move along[Jr. Kelly]
Dem seh a how we live mek we nuh know better yah
Inna di rainy rainy weather, we a guarded 'pon di border
We haffi hol' di order
Still yuh know we dere 'pon we own
Cau' we a likkle, we a search for gold
Nuh mek no bwoy come take we throne
We haffi hol' it strong, yah!

Chorus:
I was born and raised
In a place everyday where bullets nuh stop reign
I was born and raised
Wit' a spliff inna mi mout' and a gun 'pon me waist
I was born and raised
By di pimps an' di hustlers, the homeless, the strays
I was born and raised to know, recognize, slow all di hate

[Steele (Tek)]
Rudebwoy grown upon his own damn two
Runnin' 'round doin' what the rudebwoy do
Wanna be a bad man
He was born up in the badland
Never knew his father
No one there to give him guidance
Started smokin' marijuana
Hanging out, having all nighters
His mommy never liked it
She told him I won't come visit you in Rikers
She said: you never wan' go Rikers Island
He caught a charge for carrying a gun
For some it's rites of passage
(To the streets we make a marriage)
Concrete jungle with the savages
(We facin’ different challenges)
Only the strong will survive
(Living in the belly) ‘cause the beast swallow you alive
Preaches couldn’t save him (but a gangster still prays)
Keep the humble when you hustle
Live to see another day


[Chorus: Jr. Kelly]
I was born and raised
In a place everyday where bullets nuh stop reign
I was born and raised
Wit' a spliff inna mi mout' and a gun 'pon me waist
I was born and raised
By di pimps an' di hustlers, the homeless, the strays
I was born and raised to know, recognize, slow all di hate

[Tek (Steele)]
What type of nigga, slang and bang in the streets?
(A bad man)
That's the type of company you keep
They say the energy gets circulated
(Vibes get communicated)
The actions and the mannerisms imitated
Sharp dressed (Jah Bless)
When you see 'em salute your highness (Salute!)
He's one of fifteen out his daddy's sack
Him was a true gun man so him come from that
Raised in the ghetto singin' songs of survival
Where we learn to conquer fears and our friends become our rivals
It's a concrete jungle where the savage rules
And violence begets violence, wah yuh do?
Live fast, die young
You never know when the death angel come
Life is shorter than a midget on the curbside
So, lift up your life and enjoy the ride

[Chorus: Jr. Kelly (2x)]
I was born and raised
In a place everyday where bullets nuh stop reign
I was born and raised
Wit' a spliff inna mi mout' and a gun 'pon me waist
I was born and raised
By di pimps an' di hustlers, the homeless, the strays
I was born and raised to know, recognize, slow all di hate(2Pac talking)

Hey
Watch me
Wipe em scared
Oh
Why is it that we gotta be
(Watch your back)
Contactin niggas in the cemetery
Funeral homes
Buried
Seein' all my homiez burried
Moms all worried and shit
Why is so many black brothaz dyin
One day we can all be together smokin weed gettin high
Maybe in our dreams over sheds is reality
Wheres your family at?
Niggas say one love
Fuck one Love nigga
One Nation

(Verse One: 2Pac)

Now it's time for
Retaliation, perpetrating get you punished, how could you
Cross the nigga that put food inside your stomach?
Watch me
Point the pussy out the crowd time to pay for
Past discretions, never learned your lessons in this deadly war
Let's explore the possibilities, them niggas killing me
Head all busted
Over this trick nigga I trusted, now it's
Hard to figure knew this nigga for eternity
And, never in my deepest thoughts figured he could turn on me

(Verse Two: Buckshot)

So many to choose from
Niggas close to me I wonder how I lose them (How I lose one)
Maybe because I put them on the podium before me (Oh yes)
I use to think that's how it should be
Until them niggas cross me, it's different now (Different now)
Bitches wait until I got cold (Turn it up)
And told a boldfaced lie (Lie)
But still I never asked why (Turn it up) (Why?)
I keep stepping with my weapon on queue
Cause now I got my eye on you (Got my eyes on you)
Before my crew, remember how you do
Now you want to pursue
The B.D Buck just because your jealous as a motherfucker (Jealous as a
Motherfucker)

(Chorus: Smif-N-Wessun & 2Pac)
Every man has a right to decide his, own destiny
In the end it's
And in this judgment there is, no partiality
So arm in arms (Arm in arms)
We fight to live and struggle (Fight to live and struggle)
Overcome all the troubles
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight) (Your fight is my fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
What you gonna do?

(Verse Three: 2Pac)

Now if my memory serves me justly
I showed you love but you the same one that tried to fuck me
And now I got this pistol pointed at your mouth, ready to squeeze
You see, snitching is an epidemic killing disease
Exit
Throw your gun away, take your time, free your mind
Forget about the crime, and it will all go away in time
My information strictly based on niggas faces
Past cases with the law, plus a life of living raw
Brothaz at arms

(Chorus: Smif-N-Wessun & 2Pac)

Every man has a right to decide his, own destiny
In the end it's
And in this judgment there is, no partiality
So arm in arms (Arm in arms)
We fight to live and struggle (Fight to live and struggle)
And that's the only way to
Overcome all the troubles
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight is)
Your Fight (Your Life)
Let's get it on now
Uh
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight is)
Your Fight (Your Life)
Let's get it on now
Uh
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight is)
Your Fight (Your Life)
Let's get it on now
Uh
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight is)
Your Fight (Your Life)
(What? Say what?)
Let's get it on now
Uh

(Steele talking)

My fight is your fight, we could do this all day and all night
So I tell you what, One Nation, we gon' set up this plantation
This foundation, and we gon' take it to the real enemy
The one who ain't a friend of me
The one, the war continues, the struggle continues
All solider's be friends of me[Steele]
I walk around town with the pound strapped down to my side
No fronting just in case I gotta smoke something
Round here heads don't act their age
You might be another dead bwoy pon rage
Enter the cipher with your lighter
L's are ready, prepare for another all nighter
But keep a watch for the cops cos they rock Glocks
Coming on the block trying to rock knots
Pigs be acting like they bigger than us niggas from the streets
Cos we stalk mad deep and dem walk beats
I guess dem hold a grudge cos I won't budge
Playing tough, staring down the judge with my hands cuffed
Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear
Awww yeah now I'm up outta here
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it cos I'm brown or is it because I'm from Bucktown?

[Hook]
Bucktown!
Home of the original gun clappers
(Repeat x8)

[Tek]
Got five MC that wanna contest we
Got your nooses ready hanging over the trees
Bring on your sounds and get drowned by my massive
Kill you batty boy and hold your lover for hostage
Knock knock niggy-knock that's four shots empty
On a violator that was sent out to get me
I'm tore up from the floor up and everything's black
But still I'm on point ready to buck, ain't nothing sweet, jack
Bucktown, I represent it on the love love
Deeply rooted from my Timbs to my dick above
Don't sweat the bulge coming from my hip
Grip what you get hit when I let my tool click
Nowhere to run, ambush lurks in the dark
Heltah Skeltah smirks while you're getting torn apart
Here come the rude bwoys with the ganja plants
Smif-N-Wessun generals of the Boot Camp

[Hook]

[Tek]
Another murderer, just another prankster
Rude bwoy dead cause him thought him was a gangster
Tried to live the life of a hood from the streets
Test the wrong dread, now the man returns to sleep
Mr Ripper I lurk in the Stuy
Twist up the ganja when I want to get high
With my bredren, a buddah session, learn your lesson
Or get blasted by Mr Smif or Mr Wessun

[Steele]
Bucktown's everywhere I swear
It's clear to me, you feel the weed, now I really see
Nightfall round the way
Original heads come out to play
Puff herb, break day
It's just a regular, everyday state of being I
Mind holds the weight, rhymes free the mind in time
I find reality follows me where I roam
360 degrees back home in...

[Hook]Yeah
Y-Yeah
Once again
Bucktown USA is the place where I rest
Should I say chill cause there ain't no rest for me yet
Shit, I can't say chill .cause the property's hot
Got to get it while the gettin' could be got or get not
Cause of those who cock block, or those who get not
Spillin' beans like a cook to them crooked ass cops
To all my G's don't snooze
Cause they crews in blues and whites
Comin' to the PJ's lookin' for fights
Mr. Officer cool down your temper
Me just cool you n'alf to come like no murderer
I try to do my thing, and you try to take me in
Have me stressed with a bunch of dope fiends in the pen
Then again
That's the place where you see the same face in thew street
Everybody got to charge the beat
Once again
Facin' the magistrate with the screwface
Bounce on the D.A. TS done beat a new case

Chorus:
Bucktown
Home where the grass is greener
And all the gods and earths choose a court in Medina
Bucktown
The place where I received my roots
Got put on to this loot
And got my first Tim boots
Bucktown
See me in the G-S-3-0-0
On the side of the road
Gettin' harrassed by po-po's
Bucktown
Home of my B-C-C
And everybody that I roll with, the family

Boot Camp's the way of life for a loner like me
Constantly holdin' courts in the street with police
Like the sergeant 81st, pretty boy is what they call 'em
Said he was a gun man, duke is kinda brawlic
Speaks with an accent, Guyanese I would imagine
A hot-headed dred known for jumping into action
We danced a few times
He got his, I got mine
Called the whole force up to pat us down for the crime
Said it's all about a quarter and his veins bleed blue
Your man Rudy, Giuliani fucked it up for you
Ain't gonna be no dice throwin'
Dead that weed blowin'
Domestic violence, automatic five, he ain't jokin'
Now you first offenders are gettin' hit like predicates
Goin' through the system just for standin' on the strip
Gotta keep an open eye when it's time to cop la
From dirty ass deeds and unmarks ridin' by

(Chorus)

Home of the Originoo Gunn Clappaz
And bank safe crackers
Pot-pushin hustlers and everyday jackers
When flauntin' get cautioned if you don't ride with the right crew
?????????????????? and bust off when they can front on you
I still do
Smoke buds with the thugs
About to face the judge
Show all my niggas love
I can't knock the hustle, get your cream by all means
Do what you gotta do to live, to feed you and your seeds

Bucktown's everywhere I see
Representatives livin' nocturnally
Break a day on the regular
All night is all right with us
As long as we can get rid of the red we get the better
But never lose your head, just maintain
Only use the cushion pain to ease your brain
No strain
When Tek and Steele bang
Ain't shit changed from birth
B-C-C degrees, on to them other planes

(Chorus)
FamWolves out, baby

[Verse 1: Smif-n-Wessun]
My barrel lean like thorazine
Like Reverend King, cream like Medellín
Cartel spark reel, y'all in the mezzanine
Swimming at the shot ball, shot ball, guillotine
A hundred on the dot balls, dark on the big machine
Blowing at your entourage, old squad, wolverines
Camouflage dons, spits hella steam, prophesize, we monopolize
Gotta get the green
Backs in my nap sack, roll up a swisher, sweet, light a spliff, life's a bitch
Freaking off with the team, off the shit I've seen, probably should be dead now
Fuck the zombies, smoke the bong, it's weed to the head now
It's the semi-auto blowing through your audio
My niggas press you and leave you in the poorest mode
Known movements, it's reality music, the gun law is; if you got one, you better use it
Listen, they pit convos, see your way out before D jump over E
And F you up like a G so play silly, feel a 9 milly
Acting like you 'bout this life beef for really
Face fighting, wanna steal, y'all niggas kill me
Deer gang, 215, it's Gucci Philly, it's Louis Loaf with the smoke that beats that
Camouflage dons, Zombies, Statik Selekt
We present shots, we blowing off limbs
No sublimes, don't get it twisted, we knock them
It's a new wave, NWA, trick it how you want it, and it's all I got to say

[Verse 2: Flatbush Zombies]
[Meechy Darko]
The fame ain't changed me, I still don't fuck with you, niggas
I still be on the streets, I still scream fuck religion
I ain't scared of beef, get beef, put on a skillet
You bigots are non-existent so fuck all my competition, hold up

[Juice]
Hoes haze, no competition, your mortal vision is sacrilegious
Painting vivid pictures, smoking with the same niggas
It's Montana flow, whiter than the white cops that shot the kid on my block

[Meech]
I'm from a place where we want it, we take it

[Juice]
Gold teeth, two foes

[Meech]
Trap it in the basement
Two freaks, one Meech, it's threesomes in the AM

[Juice]
Take a whiff, fold shit, four blunts in one bash

[Meech]
Bodies in the basement

[Juice]
Homicide cases?

[Meech]
Prophesize about multiplying pot like we makers

[Juice]
Hater, you ain't on like the Lakers
I know I'm wrong but we don't go, got this slave shit
Smif-n-Wesson, one bullet

[Meech]
Your pick
Third leg, I be putting it in your bitch
Robbing like Life After Death had a fourth disk

[Juice]
Rhyme like all eyes on me times four shit
Park place, sheet pins, smoking at the ball games
Scot bucks up top only when the Knicks play

[Meech]
Smif-n-Wesson [?], OG and a switch blade
Before you cross a dead motherfucker, look both ways

[Juice]
Motherfucker, look both ways

[Meech]
Motherfucker, look both ways

Camouflage dons, camouflage dons[Ruck]
I flow fluidly, though I be the being of your bee's wax
Ease back, fo' I squeeze that
We don't need that, do we, do we?
Rap style, groupie, a dog like Tin, that's why you scared to step to me
Do we, have to result in fisticuffs?
See I get swifter myself, that's when the Ruck erupts
So think not, of what I am, and what I do
Just recognize when im on the mic, I rule

[Starang Wondah]
How many corny MC gon' try?
Fifty mc, forty of dem done die
Run wit Heltah Skeltah, through the realms of the dark
If a nigga rift, then I'mma let the 4-4 bark
Everybody knows, where my notty head grows
I turn into a lethal weapon, and start steppin on toes
I, waste no time, when I move mine
Grab my Glock, and then I clear the stuff, like I was PO-9

[Hook: Buckshot]
Why you wanna fuck wit my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp, survivin the preview and
Fuck wit my Bucktown group
And in the night, the night, who roll the tight
Why you wanna fuck wit my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp, survivin the preview and
Comin through, representin Boot Camp Clik
In the night, who roll tight

[Louieville Sluggah]
Wack MC's, have best to beware
That I fears no fears, and that's word to my dry tear
I break ya whole fuckin crew in half
Feel the wrath, as the gun cappaz clap that ass
Wontime, for ya mind, hit that ass color blind
Signed on the dotted line, it's how I live my lifetime
Reality hit me at some degrees
Now my eyes bleed (why?) Because I just smoked a bag of weed

[Rock]
Bringin forth Heltah Skeltah, be the big Rock, God help ya
I beat more ass, then Mom dukes leather belt
I gets open like doors when I be droopin
Trademark be bootin, baggin pants roopin
Hoopin and hollerin, nigga shut ya mug
Cuz I might have ya swallowin, a whole bunch of slugs
Cuz I'm bugged and my dome piece, roam in the streets
Wit my chrome, I'mma blast it, my caps magic, I get that ass quick

[Tek]
Nuff men a die, nuff men a come try
To test the worrior, I me no know why
A new breed of conquerors is on the rise
Step to my Boot Camp and catch black eyes
From the Heltah Skeltah, the Gunn da Clappaz
Smif-N-Wessun comin thru stompin out all you wack rappers
Wit the crazy dred, the mad boy head fed
Of corny shit that said, so now you bleed like your man bled
We gettin twisted as our Timb's cover pavement
Flowin state to state, pickin up the next payment
Yo thoughts smell, violator to the left
Four slugs hit them chest, no more, no less
So think about it, abort your mission, it's impossible
Or be a vegetable, and ya meant up in the hospital
You silly wabbit, tricks are for kids, don't you know that?
Fuck wit my Boot Camp, and get your wig pushed back

[Hook: Buckshot]
Why you wanna fuck wit my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp, survivin the preview and
Comin through, representin Boot Camp Clik
In the night, who roll tight

[Top Dog Big Kahuna]
I be that rude boy, bad boy, comin from the ville
Step to the Boot Camp, somebody get killed by me
The T-O-P, D-O-G, or my nigga Mr. S-T-R-A-N-G
Some of ya niggas be tryin to pull the trigga
But I figure, I could bust that ass just a little quicker
Time to catch Wreck, and back to the set
Where all them rules, them cock in check

[Steele]
All up in ya muthafuckin grill, I be Steele
Comin through wit my Wreckin Crew, so I reckon you keep it real
If not, I'm blowin spots, on whoever be showin Glocks
And what nots, walkin around fakin mad rocks
The only Rock I know is B.I.G., breakin' up N-I-double G-A'z wit' that nigga R-U-C-K
Better be ready to be jetty if you petty
Cuz if it wasn't already said, we dangerous and deadly
You better recognize or recollect, I reck a set wit a
Tek, and we askin, we blastin
Now from this you might think the Steele is trife
I earn my strife, cuz I deal wit the real in life
And I reveal my knife, to cut you loose
I'm not ruthless, but you get the boots if you useless
Cuz, time upon time, I find
If you remain blind, you get left behind
But we, see very clearly, so step up to the front
Cuz this is where we, represent on the lovely
For you and get praise due to the father above me
Cuz we ain't here to attack, or, when we take the backs off
The wack rappers that jack off
That's all that's it, strictly the bumpin shit
Niggas don't even know what they fuckin wit

[Hook to end][ Steele ]
Feel this, feel this
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

[Verse 1: Steele of Cocoa Brovas ]
S-T, Supreme Teacher, read you like a preacher
Seat you down, make you pay close attention to my ether
My aura illuminates, removin the snakes who lay and wait
Lovin to hate, but we still elevate
Massagin the brain, utilize the wisdom contained
Through the knowledge of my circumference and how to maintain
Some nights I walk with the understanding, build cypher
Like Charles Bronson, vigilante ready to snipe ya
Ignite the marijuana, roll a cigar from Havana
Tony Santana, smokin in the Coco Cabana
Or in the sauna, after doing my calisthenics
Universal metrics, reversin the hex, cursin the sexist
Accepting my blessings, remembering my lessons
Take my dog's suggestions when he told me keep my Smith & Wesson
For protection, the streets is watching and they testin
They know when you're frontin and when you're representin

[ Hook ]
It's not where you be or how you be
Or who you be or what you got
Unique sounds, grounds is hot
We comin through, we tidal waves in this rap shit
Now how you be, now who you be and where you be?

[ VERSE 2: Afu-Ra ]
You wanna get with the brothers that's the illest?
The microphone have sex with my lyrics
Hit shit off, first move is doggy style
No premature ejaculation, last for a while
Flippin and turnin and splittin it, all type positions
Grabbin and tuggin and yokin it, all type of missions
Crazy - nah, I'm not that type of brother
My verses, when they out in the streets, they carry rubbers
I heard you're drippin, your rap style got gonorrhea
Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Seven days around the clock ass all in the videos
I know you like it, I do too, love the cheese
, yo
But this is hip-hop, stop it, go make a porno
Not player-hatin, on the mic I'm player-scrapin
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to zeniths
I bounce styles that's sexual, plus I'm intellectual
Thoughts transverse to physical, I keep it spiritual
I got the motts, you bust the dutch, I got the hydro
I just sit back on tracks and let it flow

[ Hook ]

[Verse 3: Tek of Cocoa Brovas ]
I give you agony, agony, agony, you wanna rump with me?
Constantly, constantly, constantly rollin a Phonta leaf
You know it's beef when you gettin stomped losin teeth
Because you sweet and ain't got no claims to the street
You'se the type to get shot and go explain to the cops
Come to court every day, make sure a nigga get locked
But I thought you had that big Glock that you bust a whole lot
Then why my nigga's sittin up in that little cell block?
I'm tellin ya, ock, the world is a spot for snid-akes
Niggas who hid-ate, do anything to get the pid-apes
Love to see me down and out, blood in my mouth
Steez all sweated out, tied up in my house
Can I live and still give, take my team on sprees?
Twistin out skeeze out of custom drop-top V's?
You know the pedigrees, always stay blowin the dick
When B.G.S. is the squad, the dice stay on the six

[Verse 4: Jahdan ]
Nuff of dem still in di valley of dry bones
Dem ah search dem Seven Seas, dem ah throw stick and stone
M-mh, dey gonna melt like snow cone
Da minute di countdown say dis ah di final showdown
Well some ah said dem ah star, dem love car
Dem at war, and a blur, dem nah really reach far
But nuff ah dem ah bafoon, dem ah goon
Cartoon, dem nah put out no conscious tune
A-fi warn dem, if dem nah listen, so we scorn dem
We gonna steer far from dem
I know that we are kings and we love nice things
But we not sell out fi no diamond ring
Yo, I got da Lord in ah mi mind
So any which part mi come, mi ah go shine
Trust me, we don't fear nothin
So don't boost up yourself like you are gon' do me somethin
Mi turn dem off like mi turn of mi light
Jah control di better part of mi life[Intro-Sean Price]
Pen my mutha fuckin' rhyme, yeah, what up, what up?
Boot Camp in the house, Sean P, set it off, yo

[Verse 1-Sean Price]
Hey yo, the arm bone connected to the hand bone
Nigga, the hand bone connected to the damn chrome
Sean is a killer, Monkey Barz, Sean a gorilla
Great ape in the flesh, the Great 8 is the best
Duke, I spit bodies and take name, and take aim
At wack-ass rappers who be thinkin' that they the king
Stop with the lies 'fore I put a knot on your eye
Pop a popular guy, pa, plot your demise
It's not just a rhyme, it's a actual fact
That the God would actually clap at any rapper that's wack
Internet niggas usin' my image, you not Sean
Triple-w-dot-get the fuck on-dot com

[Verse 2-Top Dog]
I'm still G'd up, G.C.'d up
B.C.'d up, blaze the weed up
Henny in my cup, jump in my truck
Knuck if you buck and bust if I don't trust, so...
Don't You Cross The Line, understand?
Or the gun's in my hand, the gun goes "blam"
My shit don't jam, murk you and your fam
In a military stance, got you pissin' in your pants

[Verse 3-Rock]
Yo, I roll with a bunch of gun dumpers
You'se a fag, you roll with a bunch of butt munchers
I will ghost you, but won't nobody call no Ghostbusters
Bet if you live, next time you'll call some toast busters
I'm so gutter, since you really shook, I whoop bouncers
My reputation precedes me, they know I could and would
Out countless hood pouncers, I beat fire out of niggas like you
My right hand's a recliner, lean back off that
Track of the pack of your cabbage, fall flat
Smack of the earth, with your staff's jacked before that
Happen, I'm Boot Camp, what you expect from me?
I ain't askin' for love, you fuckers better love me

[Hook]
So Don't You Cross The Line, understand?
Or you'll get this, boy, this shit, boy
Don't you walk around like you raw
Or you'll get hit boy, click, click, boy
Don't You Cross The Line, understand?
Or you'll get this, boy, this shit, boy
Don't you walk around like you raw
Or you'll get hit boy, click, click, boy

[Verse 4-Buckshot]
Buck is mass murder, I murder the masses
New or old school, I shoot up they classes
Niggas need glasses when you lookin' at I
To recognize BDI, I'm a crook 'til I die
Fuck y'all, why? I was on the low with no dough
And y'all was like, "Nah, I don't no go"
When y'all had yo flow, now my attitude is so-so
You jealous and you wanna tell po-po, for what, yo?
I don't sell no crack
I don't sell no cocaine, weed now or none of that
But, I am here for runnin' rap
I tell you one thing, fuck with that, gun in your back
Boo-ya-ka! Who ya nah?
Buckshot, I was here before 2Pac died
No doubt, One Nation, I'm done wastin' time
Now my gun facin' while you wastin' lines, we rise

[Hook]
So Don't You Cross The Line, understand?
Or you'll get this, boy, this shit, boy
Don't you walk around like you raw
Or you'll get hit boy, click, click, boy
Don't You Cross The Line, understand?
Or you'll get this, boy, this shit, boy
Don't you walk around like you raw
Or you'll get hit boy, click, click, boy

[Verse 5-Tek]
This little nigga went out for a night on the town
With a cone-head hoodie and a black four-pound
Ran up to the door, told 'em "open it now
'Fore I cock back the hammer and blow the shit down"
Now you see how bad niggas on my dick
Sayin' what you did to me when you ain't do shit
'Cept hide behind your man, cop a plea to my dude
Y'all niggas is sweet, easily become food
So stay in your lane, homes, before them thangs drawn
And it be you and all of your mans gone

[Verse 6-Louieville Sluggah]
Look, ain't nobody doin' a got-damn
Forever B-C-C is the fam
So sucker niggas hate if you want
Get your chest blown out, crack a nigga blazin' a skunk
I'm high as Cheech, levels you can't reach
Sippin' on that 'Nac, tighten up the strap
Fuckin' with this 'Bad Bitch' and her name ain't Trina
Just a thorough bitch, told me "Stack and keep your feet up"
I'm on mines double time, yeah, your boy gotta shine
And my life consist of more then just rhymes
Niggas hatin' on the bankroll
But nigga, front if you want, stand under the halo

[Hook]
So Don't You Cross The Line, understand?
Or you'll get this, boy, this shit, boy
Don't you walk around like you raw
Or you'll get hit boy, click, click, boy
Don't You Cross The Line, understand?
Or you'll get this, boy, this shit, boy
Don't you walk around like you raw
Or you'll get hit boy, click, click, boy

[Verse 7-Steele]
Yeah, if you cross me, that'll be costly
Lose a lung or a limb, slug puncture your artery
Go thatta-way, you're startin' to bother me
When I'm frustrated, guns blazin', no apologies
Fuck what they told you, I don't know you
I don't owe you a damn thing, fuck what you go through
I got issues of my own, pistols made of chrome
Specially used to some dudes like you back home[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Yo, yo we throw slug rhymes at niggas over your airtime
Knock em out position, drink and piss in the moonshine
We take time, rewind that, counterclockwise
Got it on tape, swellin your face, showin you ca-ca
No shut eye, Cocoa B's, sinister B's, nuff trees
Fog like London when you come in the dungeon
Hot shit, oven mitts what you need
To swing with these three MC's like heavy pendants

[Tek]
Step to the side Dunn Dunn, you know these bullets is nameless
Like virgin ass cats who hate, because they gameless
Put down the stainless, only to grip upon the plastic
Lighter to carry, metal detectos can't track it
If it's, reason to cock, then it's, reason to spit
You took my man's shit, the reason you got hit
Now you hold that and live with it, plastic bag shit
When your boys come around, you can tell em ? did it

[Steele]
Yo watch us lace shit like new kicks, my crew's quick
To pull tools and stick you for your jewels, and loot stupid
Punk bitch, make you run quick, run yo' shit
You don't deserve it, gettin served on some herb shit
Like Pee Wee Herman, y'all niggas caught jugglin sperm
And I burn them dickriders serpents times the rounds is German
Luger shells, who the hell them nickel-plated duplicates
Fuck this, we bring the ruckus, niggas ain't doin shit

[Hook]
"For every rhyme I write, it's twenty-five to life"
"Realize sucker.."
"For every rhyme I write, it's twenty-five to life"
"Better recognize it.."
"For every rhyme I write, it's twenty-five to life"
"..better ask somebody!"
"For every rhyme I write, it's twenty-five to life"
"You don't know?" .. "You better ask somebody!"

[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Track metal, rip through your crew like hacksaws
Attack jaws, and break both legs on the tour
The crowd, beggin for more, splash em with metaphors
Leave em wet like Coney Park when I display the art
I choke notes, batter bass, murder treble
Injure contenders, and turn they whole fort to rubble
S-Double, rebel for the new millineum
Rules we bendin em back, we crackin them straps, we packin em

[Tek]
Duck Down Records wrecks ya bring the Rawkus Steele and Tek shit
Shabaam slams, my fam's connected, Duke respect it
Don't make my dog get angry in public like he does
Make shit hectic start buggin then pull the plug and disconnect shit

[Steele]
I'm like a big purple and yellow, CBR eleven hundred
You like the Honda scooter, no gears and one color
When I was younger I was speed to let the heat blow
But now I'm rappin like Usher, I do it Nice and Slow

[Tek]
Hit these niggas with a Tyson blow, slicin foes
Throwin shark skins at those who come here to oppose

[Steele]
I bled Arabic with ones, told him rock with that
My brother went up top, and seen papi with that
My nigga, what, call them bastards 'fore he cuts two gats
Another Bed-Stuy's finest was fuckin with that

[Shabaam Saheeeq]
For the record, we just grab the mic, and we check it
Kinda unexpected, for the ones that's dozin
Leavin you open like a gash, nigga PEEP my style
I rips it foul, you ain't sayin nothin I'm fearin
B-K to B-X, B-X to N-J
Music to my ear like Tito Puente, comprende?
Spit verbs for my gente, don't get it confused
You lose, fuckin with those that don't care
Put your ear to the concrete, feel the buzz on the street
The elite in my fleet, takin dimes to the hole
You ask who got soul? Sahdeeq and Cocoa's
Flow blow yours, flat on the beach like sand castles

[Hook]

And that's what it be black, it's all about
Gettin deep on, this session.. uh-huh
You know how it go, Sahdeeq, Cocoa B's, Smokin Gunz

Don't hate shit
Congradulate bitch
Get ya weight and count up
Fuck your weight dick

[Verse 3]
You wanna take this

Blue-faced-up

Every time we in ya hood watcha (Get up)
Let a half a clip loose at ya watcha (Get up)

[Verse 5]
Y'all dudes keep rhymin', freestylin' for health
Like Nike I just do it for wealth
Shoot dice in the park, stack guns on the shelf
Hate dependin' on niggas, so I get it for delf

[Verse 6]
These niggas come thru in the club
When ya get the crush, anything that go down
Gotta deal wit us
If we ain't dealin' bucks
It don't appeal to us
If these ladies keep it real
The they can chill wit us
???? bread bill wit us
What will we discuss? Bills by the break truck
All rocks taped up

[Verse 7]
I got a staff of staffs
Ears clipped as pups
That attack at the nuts when I yell click up
I got gunners and runners in the hood I stay
'Til this day, never saw you where I lay
Fuck the smoke, must want yo life to close
Get found buckwheated on a darkened road

[Both]
I know you've been waitin'
Whisperin' and talkin'
Magazines I read ya reviews
Tryna downplay the shit my team do
I caught up on my fanmail, email, online
P & C we still shine
And I'll ride for my fam cuz I'll die for mines

[Hook]

NY (NY) Hometown (Hometown) ST (Smokin' live)
Throwin' down (What)

[Verse 8]
Niggas in the parkinglots comin' from clubs
Cleanin' out your pockets to these big faced dubs

[Verse 9]
Rep for my P & C , for my family
Niggas wanna challenge me, U know the rest
The game is supposed to be sold, not told
Just tell me the number of sells ya wanna hold
We control this , forocious
Aproach this, you can hold this
I beat niggas in the with G and guns
Might do your own thing but you still my son
This strong off chain, all four cream
Tour bigger things, better livin' for the seeds
We videotape hoes in Navigators
Cause I told these haters it'll get greater later'

[Hook]

Get Up X 10Yeah yeah- suprise suprise
Yeah - guckt ma hier - Smif-n-Wessun auf meinem Song Alter

From BK to Berlin - Da hood is da hood...

[Refrain:]
Von Berlin nach Brooklyn - von Hof zu hof -
Manche Leute sähen uns am liebsten tot
Es ist überall das selbe, die Straßen sind ein Schlachtfeld
Scheiß drauf, mach was draus geh raus und mach geld

[Strophe I: sido]
Bitte rede nicht mehr, du bist der Rede nicht wert
Wenn es um Flow und Talent geht hab ich wesentlich mehr
Deine Scheisse geht mir echt auf den Sack
Was kostet deine Seele - komm ich kauf sie dir ab
Ich bin ein Vorbild jetzt - guck wie mich die Frauen lieben
Ich bin ein Star - für dich ist es nur ein Traum geblieben
Spätestens in 10 Jahren bin ich ausgestiegen
Und leb mit 10 schönen Frauen in meinem Haus im Süden.
Den ganzen Tag nur Saufen, Ficken, Kiffen, Essen -
Genauso hab ich so gelernt von Smif-N-Wessun
New York, Berlin, es ist überall gleich
Nur Sportler, Rapstars und Betrüger werden reich

[Refrain]

My hole live is real tv...

From deep in berlin out in da hood...

[Refrain]

[Refrain]

[Verse III: B-Tight]
Die Zeit zieht vorbei, doch Aggro Berlin bleibt
Geld häuft sich wie Neid wenn man soviel erreicht
Die Leute schreien weltweit, sie sind in Hysterie
Von Ghetto zu Ghetto - von Bucktown bis Berlin
Leute schieben Film, weil ich so übertrieben bin
Du sagst das ich für dich so unverständlich wie Liebe bin
Doch ich scheiss drauf - Ziel auf mich, ich weich aus
Erst bist du am haten - dann feierst du B-Tight-Flows
Du bist nie locker, viel zu verkrampft
Du hörst A.i.d.S. und verlierst dein Kopf wie bei nem Schwertkampf
Das ist normal, ich bin aussergewöhnlich hart
Du kriegst mich hier nie wieder weg, besser du gewöhnst dich dran

From deep in berlin out in da hood...

[Refrain]

[Refrain]

-Folg RapGeniusDeutschland![Talib Kweli]
Now, If I'm out of town my crew take of ya bodies the more the merrier
Point and spray the area
Niggas is quick to bury you
Punk niggas feel inferior
Guns make us superior
Cats start acting scarier
Situations get hairier, yo
You know who killing it, niggas saying they militant
The only blood in the street is when the government spilling it
You could have a hand gun or a cannon
And you still (?)
Without the knowledge and wisdom and understanding of
A 22 derringer
A 38 long
A 44 desert eagle
A Glock Nine
Time to protect the fam I'm a cock mine
"I make the streets run red like a stop sign." Stop lying

[Hook]
Co Coi Coi Clak Clak Clak Clak Clak
Gun man music never take shot back (oh!)
Co Coi Coi Clak Clak Clak Clak Clak (Come On)
Ghetto Red Hot 'round the world you hear that (oh oh oh come on)
Co Coi Coi Clack Clak Clak Clak Clak
Gun man youth never take shot back (Yes!)(Brooklyn)
Co Coi Coi Clak Clak Clak Clak Clak
Ghetto red hot 'round the world you hear that
In Jamaica (Kingston), In Brooklyn (Flatbush), In Ethiopia (Yep)
We Go There and Back (Come On)
To all my real live soldier cats where you at
Dogs don't hold them back
Those the cats that go to strapped to blow a back

[Talib Kweli]
You could be whoever, a black panther or lap dancer
When respect is the question folks coming with the gat answer
Shoot at your feet like spider, you a tap dancer
What am I amusing to you?
You better have that answer
Toys for guns? I got guns for toys
Silencers bring the heat without bringing the noise
Bringing the funk of dead bodies, go ahead bring in your boys
You'll see the soul of black folk like W.E.B DuBois
Israelies got tanks and Palestinians got rocks
Inmates got shanks and dirty cops they got Glocks
We got tribes in Africa that listen to Pac
Fighting with brothers who pump Biggie like they live on the block

[Hook]

[Cocoa Brovaz]
These are the tools of the trade
That we use to get paid
When we cruise on escapades
And escalades with guns to blaze
We been this ways since the younger days
Safe from the hunger pains
Pop Bang when the trouble came
Pioneers of gun slang
Supply you with them things
A little something, something
Set fire to the game
My system be thumping
Co Coi Coi! the sounds of guns busting
Co Coi Coi! your heart just start pumping

[Talib Kweli]
From a 22 derringer
A 38 long
A 44 desert eagle
Time to protect the fam I 'ma cock mine
I make the streets run red like a stop sign stop lying

Gun Music y'all[Intro/Hook]
Headz Ain't Ready for this Clik we got
Headz Ain't Ready man I swear they not

[Louieville Sluggah]
Nowadays I had it up to here, from my chest to my head
When the buddha bless bless my head then the eyes are red
Coming for ya, 3-2-1 nice to know ya
You wanted to pop junk
So now it's like a little Vigor
I outta floor ya

[Starang Wondah]
Heads ain't ready got the original guns and machetes
I pen that ass to the grass like I was Teddy
Cause brothers ain't ready for the fros and the dreads
Grab the Glock and hit ya from ya toes to ya head

[Top Dawg]
There's an X amount of yar-we, yo pass the gar-weed
Pass it over here so I can get Irie-why we
Smoke so much brothers be asking
Why the Originoo Gunn Clappaz keep on clapping

[Ruck]
Heads ain't ready for what my clique got in store
Cause what we got in store keeps us prepared for the war
Shows get blown, hoes get thrown out the room
Plus napkins for nitwits that ride these from now 'til noon
Now assume - position, punks pissing they pants
Cause lyrical skills is making you feel..

[Rock]
Still if-in-case you didn't know how we be livin
It's in, my nature to keep Robin like Givens
For real doe, bring your steel bro'
Kill or be killed jerk - you don't know
So that leaves ya screwed like a dildo
I still blow, punks I crush into dust
Plus we got ya bucks (Who the warriors?)
Rock and Ruck, and what?

[Hook x2]

[Tek + Steele]
What's that aroma in the air? Trees
So what that means son?
Son that mean it's huntin season
Time to stack papes do you got what it takes
Can you react when your life's at stake?
I rock the stripes of an M-P, pon my timb tree
And keep the Taurus for my enemies
Whenever he comes in the mist of this Boot Camp Clik
It gets realer so watch Steele serve justice
Thirty-two degrees freeze until
These MC's decide to relieve you of grievin

[Buckshot]
On my way from out of state, I hit my block F-A-P
Wit my man Ruck and my man Rock S-T
Jus left my man brown nose
Now we got a sack of the black for the shows
Clothes, ain't really nothing to me
But I stay with my Timberland tree, and my
B-double-O-T-C
Rock, the party, keep my hair notty
Did you notice me flowing with potency
Buckshot b-d-b-d and the Evil Dee, we rock fluently

[Hook x2]

[Ruck]
Mr. McGee don't get me angry (why?)
You wouldn't like it when I'm angry
Ill thoughts to the dome start to change me
Rearrange the, way I be kicking, my flavor
Even my neighbours
Notice a change in the Ruckus behaviour

[Steele]
Now you roaches don't even come close or approach this
What I be smoking leave your monkey ass choking
Straight from yardie like the one Robert Marley
You hardly ever saw me witout a bag of that bomb weed
I wake up in the morning and chocolate's what starts it
Reaching in my pocket for the roach to spark it

[Top Dawg]
I'm steppin in hotter this year
Wit my bredern dry-tear, my cousin wit no fear
So who - wanna come tess Top Dawg
They dig you out the ditch and then they take you to the morgue

[Tek]
Here's Mr. Meaner, the crook with the mouth full
Known for being live and rocking those flavor Timbos
Half pass Lincoln, clothes dead and stinking
Country boy got me just zoning and thinking
Time to start stacking on you crab ass snakes
Gotta move right, cause my rep's at stake
Call up my dogs that's quick to bust
P.N.C. take it back to the dust
Now I got four eyes to watch my back
Plus my own two make it a full six-pack
Now we bring the ruckus to wannabe nuccas
Bodying suckas like I change up my chuckas

[Buckshot]
Don't you know the W-a-r (war)
Is o-n (on) open to them heads scoping
Hoping they can get a bite, and write what I write
But they don't know the night
Keeps me and my Clik air tight (right)
All you biters wanna chunk the script
But your quick to take a flick
By my side as you take my hand, giving the fake smile
But I peeped you for awhile
Ease off selector when the B.D. pulled your file
Can I pull your card again, the Buck's guardian
Is the Arm-a-Leg-Leg-Arm-a-Head
So begin to drop the bombs (Heltah Skeltah)
Booyah!

[Rock]
You ask for it, who want beef well here's war
For this I packs twin automatic 4-4's
Kids this ain't before don't even speak about my fleet
Many pop junk but front when them see me
Them not ready

[Outro]
Headz Ain't Ready for this Clik we got (them not ready)
Headz Ain't Ready man I swear they not (nah)
Heady Ain't Ready for the Clik we got (we really ready)
Headz Ain't Ready man I swear they not (nah)
Headz Ain't Ready.. for the Click we got
(They ain't nowhere near ready)
