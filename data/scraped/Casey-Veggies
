[Hook 1: Dej Loaf]
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I need a chick true talk, not fake with her walk
She got her hair done right, I be breakin' her off
I like them girls when I'm ready she be taking it off
She be tellin' me what to do cause she think she the boss
And I don't say nothin' to her, I let that money talk
We don't never trip much, we be shakin' it off
Win, lose, or draw, I back against the wall
I'm willing to grow, cause I've wanted it all
I'm one of a kind, she one of them dimes
Been at it for a while, we puttin' in time
I'm lovin' her thoughts, she changing my mind
We learnin' together, the stars align
Fly face, nice body, and swag crazy
She work and she goin' to school, she ain't lazy
And when she out and about, she look wavy
And when they try to ask what's up, she say Casey

[Hook 2: Dej Loaf & (Casey Veggies)]
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like
Whatever you like (x3) (she'll do whatever I like)
Whatever you like (x3) (she'll do whatever I like) (x2)

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, shorty really rock with me
I took her to the block with me
She probably spent the whole night with me
Take a gold shot with me
All them girls flock for me
But she the one that's gone ride with me
We cruise through the hood, end up in Beverly Hills
We talked about how the lime light was never that real
She asked me questions about her sex, like how does it feel
Shorty you're the best, I'm just keepin' it real

[Hook 2: Dej Loaf & (Casey Veggies)]

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
Ladies grab your girl by the hand, let them know that you're versatile
Let them know you run shit in advance
Back it up on em' yeah, do your dance

[Bridge: Dej Loaf (x8)]
Do your dance

[Hook 1: Dej Loaf][Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
With that fucking flow that s-s-so belittles men
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas, nigga listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it, in turn, these critics and interns
Admitting the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learning them digits
And simultaneously, dispelling one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fucking six-nigga energy
And crawling down 'Fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shouting, thrashing
These niggas done let the Kraken out
Crack-a-lacking, like snap, crackle, popping your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

[Hook: Casey Veggies & (Earl Sweatshirt)]
'87 roof top, Bronson
Whipping hoopties tryna boost raw chronic
(Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up)
(Sub rocking, thud knocking niggas teeth loose)
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop (Rolling with that flow swamp)
Catch me over stove top (Rapping to that coke rock)
(Passionless in old Jive clothing, with them doors wide open)
(Dim the floor lights, focused) Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
From a city that's recession-hit
With stress niggas could flex metal with
Peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments, trying to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breaking news: death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
Disappear again, reappear bearded
On top of a lear, steering it into the kids' ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot Earl
Rawer than the skinned knee cap on the blacktop
Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox
Striking, wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrolling
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Quit with all that tough talk, bruh
We know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down, bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill, so test it, all my weapons is real
Selling thizz, couldn't tell him what the recipe is
Got 'em wishing that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwing out sandwiches, niggas get it
How they live and I live for money, other words, I'm getting money
Little boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send up for me
Ain't nobody scaring me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94, would've had 'em walking down Death Row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me, "Wet 'em if they test you"
So it's Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seeing
Kitten soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it
But to each his own, I ain't tripping long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em "Free Smalls," off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief for police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J, bony niggas spraying K's
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain

[Outro]
Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch[Produced by IamSu!]

[Hook: IamSu!]
Aye, bet the money make her do a backflip
Do it for the team, homie that's it
Use to put money in a mattress
We do it all the time, no practice
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm just a young nigga with a promise future
I gotta get this dough, nigga, no excuses
You wasn't really real, it was nice to knew you
Told God I'm only bout that real he said, "hallelujah"
Take my time but it's coming in fast though
My new chick better than my last ho
Getting money I could put your mans on it
Don't talk about it, drop bands on it
I can turn your bitch into a fan, homie
Young nigga hot, put a fan on me
I'm the man homie, I'm the man homie
Young nigga hot, put a fan on me
She said I got a couple friends just like me
They from the bay, hella' thick and get hyphy
Twelve months all about the cash flip
Bet that money make her do a back flip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
It's YG 4 hunnid, I got a question to ask
Would you suck dick, fuck dick and lick balls for that hang bag
Would you let me run a train up and pay your car note
If it was due tomorrow?
If you would strictly dickly would you let a bitch lick your pussy and titties, would you?
Would you fuck me then fuck my homies, you really love me though
But he was gonna' give you that mutt
She just tryna' take care of hers, she a real bitch
But if you had a baby daughter, would you still strip?
She just tryna' get rid of that stress so every question I asked she said "yeah", aye

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Aw man, baby girl a model or a actress
I'mma go dumb on the mattress
Hit it from the front, hit it from the back end
You know she just want some satisfaction
Make her bend it over then I smacked it
I can tell that she really attracted
Run that too, man, my brody tagged it
Three hoes on me but I'm only one man
I'm faded off Patron, yeah I'm in my zone
The money make her backflip. she never going home
She do it for the books and I'mma do my stuff
Girl you know what's up, I beat the pussy up

[Hook] x2[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than Tigger
Only blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigga, (Uhh)
Cotton-picking nigger, Golf Wang season sicker than the block
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em (Uhh)
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill and let's pretend like
I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers (Uhm)
Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck
Bitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor, (Uhh)
Pink haired Mrs, I'm her mister, sipping Slurpees, bag of chips
Now show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture (Uhh)
OF is popping like a blister, need some Listerine
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister, (Uhh)
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner out a tin flask
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner
And hopefully I get her, if I don't, fuck it then
See I never simp son, polar opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch

[Hook: Casey Veggies & Tyler, the Creator]
Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
The moon now working and the stars align
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
(Somebody told me...) I had a decline in the buzz
Not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge
And ask Bob bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum
In Bikini Bottom, I am the biggest problem
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem
Heaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthon
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem

[Mike G]
I'm like goals, those are something you have to stand to reach
My campaign speech elect me Commander in Chief
Respect to whoever's minor appearances cause mass hysteria
But I'm still incomparable, I'm like the face of America
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold
I'm a fucking centerfold, I'm something to behold
I can kill a hundred shows, take one for the road
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
It's a dog eat dog world, don't get bit bruh
A son of a bitch I am, yup, I'm a sick pup
(I thought that you were nice) Yeah, I am, slut
I'm also half ass a racist who hates niggas – yep, I'm a mixed mutt
Preme is the top bunk, green is the pillow case
Golf is the bedsheets, (hat and my T-shirt)
TrashWang sticker on that Chima Fergolfson
I'm real with the box, and I murder with the pen
It's Bimmer Boy's boy never swerving in the Benz
I'm listening to Dead Sam demos on the ten
Can I get a medium with cheese and bacon?

[Outro]
It's Loiter Squad nigga...
Fucking Loiter Squad...

Sam's after you
Sam's after who?
You!
For what? What the fuck?
He found out that you and Salem been hanging out, he said he gonna kill you
Kill me? What the fuck you mean kill me? Slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean he gonna kill me?
I don't know, he just said he gonna kill you
Not if I get to him first[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in its design
I spent some time just thinkin', where did that get me? high, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world, a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun
And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one, but I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

[Hook]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch spliff
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America, motherfucker, welcome to America

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? bet I steal her
Shout out to my wigga Mac Miller
Comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
They don't know I come from the illest
City on a map, we don't know how to act
Realest young rappin go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal, Veggies

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6
Rise to the top, the topics change the Glocks in the stock
Exchange that watch the price of life on the block
Drop insane, you can't stop this reign, Don't name drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains it's awkward strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Everybody love him and chicks offered top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters so up in the flow
No deal but flow so real keepin' in the scoops
Sun got shine, now he said he shady but he never dippin' though
Still facing L's you would think the niggas wins was low
What you think I'm in this for? Won't stop till the nigga who
Invented dope in the flow will behind bars droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources now he in the store[Produced by Dawaun Parker and Futuristiks]

[Intro: Phil Beaudreau]
I found love and I stopped lovin
Found God when I stopped lookin for one
Found a life but can’t make a livin
Don’t wanna find the end so I’m still in it
Still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
Nothing matters anyway
‘Cause I’m still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
If I’m moving on it anyway

[Interlude]
Yea, yea, word
Life changes
Ah man
Yea

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
How is anybody gon hear it if I don’t record it
New shit I’m driving yo I probably couldn’t afford it
Would be trapped in a hood state of mind, end up less rewarded
But I took a couple chances, now life is gorgeous
This gon change everything
Like a child, a funeral, or a wedding ring
But heaven brings angels down, now watch us while we levitate
Called the police when she needed, but they showed up hella late
I just do my dougie on these hoes
I’ll be dancing in the rain, soaking puddles in my shoes
Broken heart plus the rules, open art full of clues
No bizarre, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther always knew it yeah
Life changes

[Hook: Phil Beaudreau]
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
All the new things around me and I really just wanna be comfortable
You know everything about me and that’s why I fell in love with you
I just want you to be down for me ‘cause I really can’t keep up with you
Times my mind be clouded and I feel I had enough of it
Lord I pray I live and grow, please just help me fight pain
I never jump to no conclusions and always know that life change
We never thought it would show up, sometimes God just invite things
But I’m moving at a good pace, just moved into a new place
On me you live a movie when you play a role and just do it
I just do my dougie on these hoes
I’ll be dancing in the rain, soaking puddles in my shoes
Hopped out the shower in a towel, then it dropped i told her pose
So I can snap a picture on my phone, so I can see it whenever I’m gone
Don’t wanna grow up but I’m grown
Don’t wanna blow up but I’m gone
Make sure it’s proven and known I wasn’t just the next rapper to be on
Young winners, we got it man, they smiled in our face and then doubted us
She made you love her then smashed your friend and let you know that it wasn't shit, life changes

[Hook]
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
All the new things around me and I really just wanna be comfortable
You know everything about me and that’s why I fell in love with you
I just want you to be down for me ‘cause I really can’t keep up with you
Times my mind be clouded and I feel I had enough of it[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Hello, the hype is so mellow
Bitch I'm dope but my pipe is so yellow
The blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title
Nigga fuck your role model bitch, I'm my own idol and
If you can't face it my nigga, you can ass it
My accessorize accessories bring out my assets
Nigga they sound on acid, tablets
Stussy’s G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses
I suffer from ADHD
I should win a fucking award for being me
Beat banging the tom-toms
My producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck Vons
Ace the underdog, thrown them on the back bender
Cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender
Eating Belgian waffles with Italian biscotts
I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off
And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off
Step one: pull your panties down and start to piss off
Step two: run to your radio, turn this shit off
Nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help
So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me
With Gucci belts, Gucci imprint from leather welts

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm so dapper man, funky fresh Dapper Dan
I'm your favorite rapper, fan, it's an honor to shake my hand
On award tour, on excursions, I'm a virgin of swap meets
I'm so pure, so sick it's no cure
I'm dope, where the fiends at? Aight, where the jeans at?
The hat, the crew, the t-shirt is Supreme

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
And they see me they play Pictionary
I got a good way with words like a dictionary
And in that dictionary my name is by "Fresh"
They at the same spot they making no progress
Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy of a process
Eargasms they have them
The hotels we staying in twelve star
Tyler say "Yo Casey just write a twelve bar"
If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars
You haters put up your guards
They against us? Oh no
Red and white diamonds, Supreme box logo[Intro]
Yeah
I'm in South Africa right now if you're wondering
I'm out here in the field
Almost done with my debut album
Hope you doing good shawty

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Saint Laurent raincoat, at the restaurant with my main ho
She a mix of black and anglo, going down the pipe like Drāno
Shit change when yo' chains grow
I got a girl that chase where yo' chain go
I'm off the chain like the Django
Poppin Champagne, and Rose Moet
Been two years she growing up, damn girl you got body
And I'm trying to remember the last time when I seen you last at that party
She signed up for my program and then hopped up in my Audi
We ain't really with all the titles, but she know that that's my shawty

(YEAH THAT'S MY SHAWTY)
I been busy dream chasing and recording
Let's hit the hotel and have a party
I fuck with black bottles, moet and that shawty

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Puma Life we Killin that I rock headbands all summer

If this was like '06 I would've pulled up in that Hummer
Yellow with the windows tinted rims big like bitch get up in it
She dancing on me like Soul Train, I'm a rockstar like Coldplay
I bet that money gon' make her do it, These broke niggas get no play
Get to the dough my day job, We do it no practice like A I
If this shit was the NBA, then I'm that rookie nigga that stayed on
Life Changes, White ranges, Black beamers, and Jeep wranglers
PNC , we got our own store on Beverly, them white people hate us
Hater niggas is instigators, I guess the boy intimidate ya
Young nigga been running the city, When I was 7 I got plugs with the mayor
I fell in love and I felt played, that's how the game go
I'm grinding out in Cape Town, all around the world my name known
A lot of people gon' stay down, but when shit hit the fan then they gone
The dark always come to light, I'm just glad that it didn't take long
Girl I need that to go for that take home
These bitches love me like a Drake song
Ever since my grandma passed away, My momma showed me how to stay strong
We blowing up like Napalm, these days short and these night's long
Girl I know that I fucked up but I learned from it that's the right wrong
I beat it up with my ice on, She like "Casey, you on your rapper shit"
21 I made years in Veteran, never quit
Don't bring your girl around me like Trey Songz I take your chick
Subtweet, yeah that's my freak, I hit it twice a day all week
It's Young Veggies, you know my name, I don't like to play, but I play the game
It's levels to this shit boy, and me and you are not the same
Peas and Carrots you know the gang, Hunnit Mil that's the aim

[Verse: 1]
Yeah
Life fades as the sun raise 
Your love is like a nice fade and some new J's
And 07 was the year we went to heaven 
I didn't expect it, everything just crept in
My next sin turn the lights off girl, you my weak spot
Even though I might talk girl, you just white talk girl
Freeze the boy then you leave me there, it ain't fair, (I know)
I still  got time to go
I tell my friends all the time aboutcha
So I would really be quiet withoutcha
Do you feel special that this rap is for you
When you hung up on me I wanted to tear you in twos
What am I supposed to do 
All my lies stay true
Look in your eyes make me blue
Then they, turn red and I'm all in your head
We can sit and watch TV, and lay on my bed
My mom will take you home later
I'm always doing favors cuz I'm loving every flavor
Sweet like a life savor, your a life savor 
Because you changed my thoughts
Thats why when we get the movies yo ticket gets bought 
And if a nigga try to talk to you, he gon get hawked down I hate that shit
I would never get in-between another dude and his girl, 
So why all these lame dudes try to ruin my world 
He calling your phone and its making me hurl
I wanna pick up the phone and say this is my girl, what you need what you want
And I ain't even gon front, you get on my nerves go fly on a bird and go back where you came from, you little lame chump
But I'mma chill, I'm just tryna keep it real
I'm jut tryna give you kisses girl and show you how I feel 
Its like me and you running up a steep hill, and if I get tired
You keep going and a nigga get fired, I'm on fire when you make me mad
I'm writing raps realer and I hope it don't get too bad
I wanna support you in any way no other ever had
And when I blow up with rap, you gon have everything you ever wanted and ever had 
And just to think a southern girls loving a boy
But I dust em right off cuz I'm loving with joy you know
And you ain't never bitter, but you made bad decisions, which then made collisions, to my heart
For what it known from the start
I don't think we would have made it this far
I woulda saw you differently 
But girl I think you changed so vividly 
And I respect that 
Its like a set trap that got me from behind
Its not even you face girl its everything inside
Though everything I think about what you did with them other guys my brain fries
But I know I'm you only your main guy
That was the past this is now
Like a smile + a frown and every time I clear my mind its going down
And every time she feel the need to you goin down making me
Feel like you care, and grabbing your hair
You a year older but I really don't care
You gave me the same chance thats wat really was fair
And I turned out to be something that really was there 
I'm real mature for my age so you thought we would pair, and we did
When we grow up you having my kids
And when I think I  know you its something I feel in my ribs
Them I barbecue  it got me leaving my fears
I don't act hard, your mama said you shouldn't date a rap star thats driving a fast car Well baby I'm better than that 
Cuz I'm real  fine mannered and I know how to act
So tell mom I'm never leaving and if I do I'm coming right back
You was running round them tracks, you was running through my mind
You shine 
You make me feel like everything is fine so 
We gon get it together, everything gon be better
This is right around the way 
And other than this song I don't have much to say 
So as long as my shoulder here you got somewhere to lay
And wen we both start driving I wanna see you everyday (ok) 
Thats as far as I got[Intro]
Let's get all the money
Let's get it all
Right now
You gotta be a genie out here

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Floating thru the streets like Aladdin
Got young freaks on my mattress
If that girl with me she the baddest
If he go against me he the saddest

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
All these girls fucking for the status
I see the game for what it is you see it backwards
I run thru that girl first you get her after
Imma real nigga, girl I ain't no rapper
Or really I'm tryna say I ain't like these rappers
Just know that shit you putting out it come back at ya
Got a small college chick, we put that dough together
If she eating veggies, she gon live forever
I'm floating thru the streets like Aladdin
I don't see nobody I think I need glasses
Different whips like them slave masters
Nigga try to hang me I'mma bash em, I'mma bash em

[Hook: Casey Veggies 2x]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Aight, these niggas look at me like "How it happen?"
He started free but now the nigga out here taxing
I bought another Jesus piece to show my passion
You think I'm popping now wait till I drop the Jasmine
So many stacks on me it got my pants saggin'
I do the Audi let my momma pull the Jag in
And truth be told I ain't really with the braggin'
I just remember so it's like I'm re-enacting
They yappin, they talking for reaction
I'm laughing, while I'm bringing all this cash in
Right now, higher then I ever been
A couple blunts and good head a nigga medicine
Twenty stacks, hundred racks, how I bring it back
Quarter-back throw a sack, now she in the sack
And we do dinner and a movie if she into that
And if you see us you will know and you remember that

[Hook][Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I pop up on yo' block, pull up on yo street
Girl, first I got your number, then I got under them sheets
Then I hopped on top of these beats, I ain't been home in weeks
Yeah, I know you tryna eat, but, nigga, I'm tryna feast, so I gotta go
We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that
She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that
Wasn't feelin' lil mama, had to fall back
Hit my phone, ain't talk no dope, I don't call back
Write these verses so, player, we read verses in Isaiah
Baby ain't even gotta state it, she know that I'm a smooth operator
Baby talk too much and I don't like that
Gotta leave tomorrow and I ain't book my flight yet
Sometimes, no matter what you do, they forget about all that
But I know they gon' remember me, cause a boy all that
I'm ballin', she want it, I get it, I get it
I'm plugged in, got friends that, spend millions

[Hook x2: Casey Veggies]
We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that
She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that
They don't think we from the streets, but I'm bout all that
I came up from the bottom, I do all that

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
All of these bitches be jockin', all of these niggas keep hatin'
I get Jacksons, Grants, and Franklins so we call that changin' faces
Stuntin' off in the Bugatti, drive so fast you think I'm racing
My nigga, this weed so strong, I'm gone, you might think I laced it
Ballin', bitch, I thought you knew
If you niggas had my paper, you'd be ballin' too
Teach a nigga how to stunt, I should start a school
All I do is press a button just to start the coupe
Swimmin' in so many women, I lost count
Once they give me that pussy, homie, I dog 'em out
If you ain't talkin' bout money then what you talkin' about?
If they say money talks, then my dollars shout
Popsicles on my chain, ice cubes on my wrist
Snow cones on my fingers, yo' bitch on my dick
Street nigga, still have a mill up in my shoe box
Old school, still keep a stash in my tube socks
Kush, all up in my rollin' papers
Got me coughin' like a cancer patient
Countin' cash like a calculator
OG still gettin' dome like activator, all that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I fuck bitches, I get money, I do all that
Niggas want me to impress 'em, they can fall back
I'd be trippin' if I told you I was all rap
I got stocks, I got blocks, nigga, hold that
Wal-Mart prices on the roll backs
Cheap shit, nigga, we don't know that
Expensive, designer, we spendin', we spendin'
I'm ballin', got friends that's, Egyptian
And I'm out for that payback
Got a couple niggas that stay strapped, yeah
New school had a nigga trippin'
But my old bitch helped me get my soul back, yeah
I started off in a Sonata, then I went and got me a Range
Then I went and got me a Beamer, now a few of my homies do the same
Nigga we don't care about chains, I can shine in white T
That's pro'ly why yo' bitch like me
Low key she wanna be my wifey, I'm thinkin' that she might be
Show her shit you never show her
She wanna get high I insert with a quarter
We playin' games, you out of order
Thirsty nigga need water, you know you can't afford her, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ty Dolla $ign]
She got blunts, I got papers, we got all that
We gon' smoke, we gon' fuck, we did all that
Homies trippin' and we trippin', we with all that
Pint of act, double cups, we got all that
Lil bruh fought his case, just gave him all day
Baby Buddha in there too, he got all day
Time goes by, puffin' on shake
Just to keep him high, watch the time waste
L.A. niggas in Atlanta strip clubs
Smoking good, eating good, I just fell in love
Lil bitch told the homie she don't have sex
We already fucked, you ain't gotta flex

[Hook][Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
100 miles and runnin'
Always into something
Yelling fuck the police
Like I’m straight up out of Compton
Real niggas don’t die
Appetite for destruction
Just a nigga with an attitude
Always into something

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Stampede  on stomp, mash smash out
Cashing and taking motherfucking cash out
Hit double time switches pushing glass house
See the bitch like the garbage, take the trash out
[?] dear mama , here I come, Osama
[?] Big Snoop, [?]
Casey with the suit cases filled with llamas
In the car banging like a house party
Blowing out the speakers with the L.A. Leakers
Get fat burgers just to get a meal
And if a nigga trip I'mma shoot to kill
Ice cubes in my drank, I kill at will
Wish a nigga would cause a nigga will
Jump off with the sickle cell nickels?
Spray off  always into something dumpin', looking for a nigga
Now I got 'em

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Still got impalas on eights, coupe riding with case
Smoke a blunt with Kurupt, lettin' the chevy move bass
Got the two on the waist, Jordan eights on the pedal
Ridin' down the  [?], showin' love to the ghetto
Niggas thought i was west cause I'm on the [?] with nigga
On the town front 'em swap meet with the Compton Crips
I get love out there from the hills to the strip
But I'm a mid-west nigga, don't mistake that ish
I'm authentic to my pearly whites, never bite and shit
So all that heckling and loose talk, get tightened quick
I'm from the bloodline of hustlers, bow tie and pricks
Gentleman services, million dollar fence
Rottweilers and pits, loud bops on the corner
Every nigga did juvie before they get the diploma
Stay runnin' from cops cause they now they pop on us
Most of mothers are single and most of fathers are stoners
And we coming from nothing, so we

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Ridin round, round we go , I get around
Tryna make a dollar outta a dime right now
The illest youngin'  outta LA in a minute
Working down the 4, come home, I give it the business
If I give a fuck about a chick I be broke
Kurupt in the studio off them  moon rocks we smoke
Cops pull me over, they want my license revoked
I pull up in that Bimmer, give the young niggas hope
California weather, I swear it's so amazing
In my own city it feel like a vacation
Real west side, nigga, and I hate waiting
All we know is hustling,  gettin to the paper
They show me love every time I come around
I'm always into something, need to slow it down
I'm gettin' older now, man, I'm really growing now
Man in my city like the mayor how I roll around

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign][Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in its design
I spent some time just thinkin', where did that get me? high, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world, a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun
And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one, but I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

[Hook]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch spliff
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America, motherfucker, welcome to America

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? bet I steal her
Shout out to my wigga Mac Miller
Comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
They don't know I come from the illest
City on a map, we don't know how to act
Realest young rappin go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal, Veggies

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6
Rise to the top, the topics change the Glocks in the stock
Exchange that watch the price of life on the block
Drop insane, you can't stop this reign, Don't name drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains it's awkward strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Everybody love him and chicks offered top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters so up in the flow
No deal but flow so real keepin' in the scoops
Sun got shine, now he said he shady but he never dippin' though
Still facing L's you would think the niggas wins was low
What you think I'm in this for? Won't stop till the nigga who
Invented dope in the flow will behind bars droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources now he in the storeA million females with good details
You shop retail, I hit the boutiques up
Flow so sweet huh? So conceited
Hit me on my beeper
You back in the Days Inn, I am on my leave
2000, I'm wiling, I'm styling
The boy bout to blow up, money bout to start piling
That girl is Italian
Y'all don't wanna know the outcome
The game you playing, I'm dealing with the lames, and

I'm wild, I need taming
You niggas better d-d-duck when I'm aiming

With a ? status fitted on my hair
And motherfucker I'm ill

Hold up, wait, all you niggas get back
Rehab flow: all a nigga do it ?
Dropped out of high school to get every dollar
Get it? GED: a real Rhodes Scholar
Drinking Milk of Magnesia cause I refuse to see a doctor:
That's sick, and Casey V asked me to murder this shit
DVR flow, you should pause and rewind me
Clown ass rappers over here trying to mine me
But this beat over his head just like
Diddy did Steve Stoute

You average rappers killing me, I mean really offending me
Talking about shit an average rapper hasn't really seen, like

I'm sort of like a journalist, writing what I see

Literally: yes, the article is all on me

I practice what I preach like I'm some sort of preacher

I'll have your ass on murk like sour lemon diesel

Cotton mouth, slavery, weed ?

Street cred like Big, me doing it big

Arrogant Veggies, you can't test: rude boy[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
You old niggas should pay homage
I put on and I stay honest
And I do this shit with great honor
Honestly I thought the people just should wait on it
But Here it goes now so tell me what's your take on it
I've been thinking bout a lot of ways to make money
I'm 17, It's why I'm trynna be great, homey
You heard my old shit, Man that was '06
My Track record stretched out like aerobics
I do it big like one man with four chicks
At the same time, Still on the same grind
Make my mama proud, hope it all remains fine
It's Young Veggies, (I) know you heard it through the grapevine
Kid rappin bout his girl, hope she stay down
I do my thing man this life is like a playground
On the swing and I hop off on the way down
I dare a hater nigga have somethin to say now
Trynna shine, get on my grind for the first down
And If I get tackled I hope I don't get hurt now
Started rappin, A lotta ho's trynna flirt now
But she ain't good for nothin but pullin her skirt down
I gave her ass a job, I call these girls work now
My brother's in college, I hope it all work out
But I'm a star it's to late to try to work now
I got a voice, might as well take em to church now
In this world, It's all about what you're worth, now
So I rock my aviator clothes, that's some shit you'll never know
Cause it's high up in the sky, That's the place you'll never go
I used to sit up in my room, now I can go and rock a show
We ain't got nothin to prove, but everything to lose
Cause Niggas walk around the hood, like Ebenezer Scrooge
I always got my morals, but I'll forever think I'm cool
And niggas hatin on me now, cause they got nothing else to do
I can see it in my mind, I'm trynna see if it is true
And I swear if it is, Then Mama you have been proved
That I did it all for you, because you always held me down
If you ain't feelin how I talk it, then respect how It sound
Visions of me and my niggas writin checks at a lounge
Every time the kid do it, know it's bout to go down
I put it all in my music, what Can a nigga tell me now?

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Just know I did it all for yall
Grinded summer to the fall
I will answer with pride whenever I receive a call
But when I call yall and tell yall that it's time to ball
Want you to stop what you're doing, head straight to the mall
Want you to shop till you chained up, can't even walk
We're all slaves to this life but it's all we were taught

[Outro (Talking): Casey Veggies]
We're all slaves to this life but it's all we were taught
Yeah, Yeah
We're all slaves to this life but it's all we were taught, haha
Yeah
At the end of the day, no matter how you put it, life is but a dream
Dream as big as you can
Sometimes you may lose focus on what's important in the perfect world
But always know that there's light at the end of the tunnel
Never let them see you sweat Never let em tell you "You Can't"
Never doubt, never lose a purpose, never lose a grind
Peace and much love to you[Verse 1]
Yeah, started workin' when I was 13
Put my shit out on my own, now I'm startin to run things
Wakin' up to see what the sun brings
A blessin' how I took nothing and I still made it to something
She lookin' like Amerie, maybe it's one thing
When I see that ass and that tongue ring, I'ma come clean
Really got my eyes on that green, guaranteed that I'ma ride for my team
Fuck do you mean, young boys ain't fuckin' with me
Open the door for you to do yo thing
I'm a real young king, keep swingin but them hits dont sting
I got rich and my hood too mean
I took my dreams, made it real and now I created a scene
Made a movie in the V.I.P, it's Young C.V
Quarter back for the PNC, I'm in the hood like the EBT
Nigga the hood know me

[Verse 2]
I'm, I'm, I'm getting to the money, Ray Charles, nigga with my eyes close (with my eyes closed)
These boys living out here bad, I would hate to be broke (hate be broke)
We came from Rags to the Riches, my grandma she always watch over me
They wasn't noticing, been in the game since a youngin
But now I came back with my older shit, makin the colder shit
I know it's a hit, I wrote it with focus
My older shit they quote it, givin away for the free
And they hit me like, why you ain't sold this shit
Nothing like ownership
I get to the show, and they selling out all of my clothes
I could buy my mom a new house, and a black mink coat

[Hook]
When it comes to the dough, you know anything goes
I got it all, and I still want more, so anything goes
She lookin out my hotel door, like anything goes
I'm out here tryna live and grow, so anything goes
Tell me is you ready, anything goes
Even if they don't let me, anything goes
I can't let you forget me, anything goes
So tell me, is you ready, anything goes

[Verse 3]
My time is now my momma proud, and I'm the youngest child I'm wit it
My daddy smile cuz I rock the crowd, and I travel miles and go get it
I see them niggas talking and know they don't really live it
Difference when you do it real, you don't fib it
Only getting started and I'm racing to a million
Once I get that milli, man I need another million, and another million
Lil, lil, lil mama looking for me, I been in the studio
A lot of my niggas sippin lean, and they smoking that dro
My lil cousin fuckin with them pills, man he just don't know
Baby girl playin with her nose, and she hope it don't show
You lost lookin for it and still searchin for a way to go
Got money put away and it's safe unless, shit get slow
I'm young and I'm pilot, she know I'm the shit, but I'm doublin mileage
She's a fuckin Goddess, I put you up in my palace, damn we came up from a cottage

[Hook][Mike Posner]
[Hook]
Why do fine girls always have attitudes?
You say one thing wrong, they get mad at you
You try and loosen them up with a glass or two
Why do fine girls always have attitudes, attitudes, yeah

My friends back home, always ask me:
"Mike, why you date no supermodels?"
Well, the truth is that they're too damn skinny and
Always order big ol' bottles, of Cristal, fuck that
No necklaces, I got a one track mind
They can't figure out why
Somebody tell me

[Hook]

My friends back home always ask me:
"Mike, why you date no actresses?"
Well, I banged a few, but all they ever do is
Talk 'bout being actresses
And I don't care, about your job
Who your co-star is, go suck his cock
Cause it doesn't make a difference to me, no
I need a down chick

[Casey Veggies]
A long flight, she was in the middle
Met a model chick on the plane
She was thinkin' 'bout gettin' some sleep and
I was thinkin' 'bout gettin' some brain
I was starin' all at her ass when I forgot to ask her name
That's a shame, I'm a dog, need to be tamed, gimme a call
Said her favorite song last year was "Blame It On that Alcohol"
At the bar, before the flight, gettin' shots, feelin' right
At the end of the day, she realize I'm a young nigga just livin' life
You get it right, I spend a stack or two
Her attitude determine latitude, like, (like, like, like)

[Hook][Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Guess that love shit don't last forever
We was in love but girl, now your ass whatever
Cause at the end of the day, I need my cash and cheddar
And the Gucci sneaks to match the sweater
I used to laught whenever, but now I'm mad at always
Cause when I hit you up, you be gone all day
Like when I hit you up, I be like come play
You be like, I can't I made plans today, I'm like, damn!
I thought I was your man, I thought no matter what
That you should always understand, cause I swear
My plan ain't to get up in your pants
But you need to gimme something you wouldn't give another man
I need to feel special, just like everybody do
But it sucks you ain't around, it was always me and you
We was always trynna chill, we was always trynna do us
It was a love bomb, but that shit just blew up
I know you seen them text, but that girl never knew us
I always holla'ed at her, but never gave her too much
The thing i loved about you, you was never on me too tough
But know when I holla at you, you be acting too tough

[Hook: (?) & Casey Veggies]
Baby don't cry, I hope you your your head up
Even though the road is hard, you can't give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you your your head up
I know it ain't cool but shit will get better

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I really love how you were, just thinking 'bout your future
And trying to get your homework done, that was so super
I didn't wanna lose ya, but that don't mean I did
But we ain't talk lately and that shit kinda weird
And I know, I could get any girl I really search for
But really girl to me, it seem like you worth more
You something to work for, you made it so hard
I think that's one of the reasons you was up in my heart
I just wanted to love, I ain't want it to end
Cause I need someone to call, when I'm in need of a friend
But I guess I didn't do right, but I can't regret nothing
Cause I was just doing me and I ain't a fan of fronting
It's crazy, the sun light leave, shit get shady
And maybe, I should just leave so you could stay free
Really let go, of the part of you that made me
But if I stay gone, you will always be my baby

[Hook: Casey Veggies]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Baby don't cry, you gotta keep your head up
I know we ain't cool but shit will get better
I don't know what to do, you doing kinda [ - ]
So why you even crying, wipe them tears off your face
It's all tears in our way, we can think about the past
I been thinking 'bout your face, I been thinking 'bout your ass
But know when I see you I just gotta walk past
Cause everytime we get back, this shit don't ever last
It's sad, I'm telling you don't cry, cause I know I heard you inside
You smiling at my face, but you be acting like [ - ]
You nigga's ain't shit, man I ain't worried 'bout them guys
Them guys is something like shrimp fries, small [ - ], tall what I love
All the above, I'm all the [ - ]
And that's all just because, we we're close
And I don't even know what happened
Now a nigga just sitting here rapping, like

[Hook: (?) & Casey Veggies]

Sleeping in class.. [ - ]...
Rest in peace 2Pac[Produced by IamSu!]

[Hook: IamSu!]
Aye, bet the money make her do a backflip

I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm just a young nigga with a promise future
I gotta get this dough, nigga, no excuses
You wasn't really real, it was nice to knew you
Told God I'm only bout that real he said, "hallelujah"
Take my time but it's coming in fast though
My new chick better than my last ho
Getting money I could put your mans on it
Don't talk about it, drop bands on it
I can turn your bitch into a fan, homie
Young nigga hot, put a fan on me

Young nigga hot, put a fan on me
She said I got a couple friends just like me
They from the bay, hella' thick and get hyphy
Twelve months all about the cash flip
Bet that money make her do a back flip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
It's YG 4 hunnid, I got a question to ask
Would you suck dick, fuck dick and lick balls for that hang bag
Would you let me run a train up and pay your car note
If it was due tomorrow?
If you would strictly dickly would you let a bitch lick your pussy and titties, would you?
Would you fuck me then fuck my homies, you really love me though
But he was gonna' give you that mutt
She just tryna' take care of hers, she a real bitch
But if you had a baby daughter, would you still strip?
She just tryna' get rid of that stress so every question I asked she said "yeah", aye

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Aw man, baby girl a model or a actress

Hit it from the front, hit it from the back end
You know she just want some satisfaction
Make her bend it over then I smacked it
I can tell that she really attracted
Run that too, man, my brody tagged it
Three hoes on me but I'm only one man
I'm faded off Patron, yeah I'm in my zone
The money make her backflip. she never going home
She do it for the books and I'mma do my stuff
Girl you know what's up, I beat the pussy up

[Hook] x2[Produced by IamSu!]

[Hook: IamSu!]
Aye, bet the money make her do a backflip
Do it for the team, homie that's it

We do it all the time, no practice
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I bet that money make her do a backflip
A hunnid' grand, I had to do gymnastics
But I ain't got no cash up on my plastic
They tell me I'm a real legend in this rap shit
But lets get back to this whack shit
This backflip got them girls gettin' rachet
She brought two hoes with her, that's a hat trick
I'm runnin' circles, run them hoes like a track bitch
I had to pick her up in my newest ride
The newest guy, out L.A, I stay super fly
The coupe in drive, dollar (?) on the west side
She bring that pussy straight to me, that's suicide
I'm still in the hood, I did this verse in Inglewood
With a model doing things she said she never would
I live the life these other niggas wish they could
But I gotta thank God cause I'm living good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm pullin' up clean in a classic
I only smoke weed, nigga, that’s it
Just left a bad bitch for a badder bitch
A million dollars make it look average
Hold up, I got KK to roll up
My bank like a pay day, they go nuts
I pour up, we slow down, they go down like mayday
That's your girl she chose up, I hit it, her legs wide, she glo up
Bet the money make her do
Just seen another 20 mill, I'm tryna make it to it
I ain't even runnin' game, told her roll a plane
Girl that basic training for the game, hope you make it through it
I'mma go hard on a bitch, I'mma do my thing do my job
I'mma hit from the window, to the wall
I'mma make you go Dominic Dawes on the dick
You know I'm talkin' 'bout?

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I was in the (?) with your boy (?)
Got a couple girls, won't you hit it with that Fergie style?
I been up cause I'm on that New York time
Hustle hard cause I'm on that New York grind
I been runnin' all day, in the studio for two weeks straight
Now it's time to play, 'bout to meet a couple cuties at Earth Cafe
I'm bout to have some cappuccino with some bitches, you know
I swear to God this bitch is lying, say her cousin's Cee-Lo
She talkin' 'bout how she be singing with these different people
And how Breezy wanna see her but keep it on the le-low
And I'm like, uh-huh, bitch you're lying just hop up on this fat dick
Baby you like it raw like I'm a dirty boss (?)
Take them panties off and I'mma make that pussy pop bitch

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
Bet the money make her do a backflip
It's (?) season, it's a wrap for all that whack shit
Out of state women like my accent
I need a R&B single like a Mac-10
You know the homies got it, never lackin'
Made a million of this independent rappin'
We gon' sell it all, we gon' get it back then
HB game gang, team captain
Faded off Patron, she won't leave me alone
The money make her backflip, she never going home
She dippin' in the dust and make that body rush
Girl, you know what's up

[Hook][Intro]
The moment you've all been waiting for

[Verse 1: Casey]
Uh, say hello to the great one
Mixtapes for free homie, here take one
It might come in handy
A record deal was the best thing y'all can hand me
My squad, the new Grammy family
Uh, but they ain't feelin' it, oh well, more bars, I'm spillin' it
Every time I touch a mic they be like yo, your touch is tight
Y'all's focus I took slow shots, bash so hard and slow
Just like a robot, you not hot man
I'm sorry for the truth, Customized Greatly, killin' shit
Casey feels sorry in the booth, uh
Flow's so sweet they put fillings in my tooth, yeah
Fillings in my teeth, Ace the Creator on the beat
Casey Veggies on the vocals got you niggas in a chokehold, uh oh
Yeah, yeah, he's at it again, spread the word tell your moms and your friend
Yeah, because I'm

[Hook]
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)

[Verse 2]
The difference between me and them rappers
Is I wear clothes fresh out the wrapper
Undivided attention, the show's on
And no cancelled shit, it must go on
Nigga, volume two, uh, turn up the volume, too
I'm crazy lyrically, come get at me seriously
Niggas know I kill 'em mentally and spiritually
I hope you're hearin' me, uh
First mixtape was hot, I hope you fear me
Believe that, y'all niggas didn't believe that he rap
And now y'all bob your heads to the things that he rap
Uh, y'all niggas didn't believe that he rap and
Now y'all bob your heads to the things that he rap
This nigga hated and she clap, no handshakes leave daps

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyler]
Damn, back for another one with robots
I'm so hot, you're cold, now here's a fucking sweater
Look, I can't have no other fun
With my pops probably cause he out with his other son
But, I'm super steezy like my last beat
My bitch super greezy like her lunch be granola bars
I spill healthy verses, call 'em granola bars
Now every bitch wanna eat her Casey Veggies with no salt
Now it's so crazy, other people than my moms is callin' me baby
My nigga get ya hopes down, you couldn't persuade me
To collaborate with you niggas, ya lyrics is lazy
I'm undefeated, but the suede shoes is Puma
I'm the cancer and the tumor with the drums and the tubas blastin'
I'm a crook and it's a castle
If I am the shit, then I'm guessin' my mom's a asshole

[Hook][Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I'm mixin' apple juice and XO
That's the type of shit we be drinking on the West Coast
I stay open when the rest closed
I got the most game never said I had the best flows
Uh a real nigga and yo ex know
Mad you can't go everywhere that us vets go
When you see me out you just gotta pay respect though
From Benz, truck, coupes, lex-o's
I like shrimp in my pesto, ya girl kinda ugly but she got a nice chest tho
I'm so disrespectual, I'm not no fucking intellectual
I'm trying to get this money so I can get me a boat
And stay away from niggas that be dirty and broke
Cause a nigga like me won't be 30 and broke
And you gone lose your life if you think its a joke
Let that simmer down for you, im not nobody thats gone clown for you
I'mma make em put a mound on you, nigga I be all around town on you

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes

[Verse 2:Casey Veggies]
Dark shades in the party, ain't worried about nobody
Man that girl know she got it, I might get her nigga watch me
And I ain't just gone pull her, ima make that girl love me
But this world full of darkness im just trynna stay above it
I just need some inspiration, maybe some ventilation
Maybe I should stop racin' the hardest shit that im chasin'
Take it slow, slow and you use to letting it go
One thing that I learn is just a bunch of shit I dont know
I'm riding round town and I made a left at the store
Ran into a girl I know, got her new number fasho I said fasho, so
She heard a few of my songs and after that I proceed to run through a few of her thongs
I keep mental philosophies that I learned even at my home
Now I'm gone for the scrilla, mom on the phone let her know that i'll be home in December
Since I can remember I was on the grind so our home wouldn't be so cold in the winter
Till I get a whip with a chick with a grip and zip I can flip and a home I can lend her

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life

[Verse 3:Schoolboy Q]
Shit, shit, all I can do is me
Few coronas or blue moons and bet I got some weed
Top Dawg fuck a bitch scratch my balls and flee
Eat pills, now fufill your drills be all that you can be
Aw, place this product in ya bra stash, smash
Fuck the police as the lights flash, crash
Got away but shit it caught the dash
Turtle necks and long sleeves because my body tagged
So back to the beats cause I fucked up my lease
Rhymes increase release to the streets heat how you need
A gangsta thats sippin pink, need to see a shrink
Going insane im crazy, going ham in that pussy Miss Piggy
Dont eat it though Veggies, the cycle goes around a regulary, wait
Slide in the path a nigga dont phase me
Dos cuatro siete I keep my nueve

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life[Verse 1: XV]
What got in her is all them girls that got in her
Ear when she heard that old nerd is newly popular
Getting looks of you on facebook, saying "X fine!"
This is when Urkel turned into Stefan
Unless I'm going crazy
And all of these ladies always liked dude
I was like Common & Kanye: too shy, dude
Now they mad when I move how I move
That's how your hoes turn to foes like 2 times 2
See, I knew it would happen with the rappin
And they lacking and they cashing
The kid in band class has got em on the band wagon
Blast from the past, chicks in class, I was passing
Notes to, they checkmark the box they said no to
I'm a new man like Randy, you can't stand your old dude
And when I ask about him you say "me and him are so through!"
All of the time I gave you all of my time
Now I got none to give and I'm all on your mind..

[Hook: GLC] x2
Now it's up to you to say that you were wrong
When I knew all along you'd call my phone
And shawty
(You can only blame yourself)
When you just hear the tone
Don't leave a message and just leave me alone

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
Remember when you left me?
You’re right for me now
I couldn’t get the time of day
Now you want nights at a time, right
But a threesome what I like right now
Life a bitch and karma’s a bitch, I’m dyking it out
Like mama mama mama, you could be the one
Really I ain’t f-ckin with you, you should be a nun
If you want a reason from me, I would say because
I told you because, no love cause I’m over you
Over you, I roll with a chosen few
No one was as cold as you
Your heart is like some frozen food
When I would go to school I would get ignored
You toy with my emotions like pieces on a board
I’m Jordan in this sport, in at every turn
Before the kid was panic, it was never concern
Not a phsycician in a clinic asking “when you gon learn?”
Just tell that bitch, it isn’t pimpin if you never been burned

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
She heard me screamin
Joined back on the team then
Started loving me more
The art of winning that war
These women don't love these artists
They often take them to stores
And hope that they get em the presents
With money we made on tour
That's cold: but you know, life ain't fair
When I needed you most
You see, your life wasn't there
When I leave here and coast
Now the phone rings bells
Looking at it while we blow L's and press decline
I'm fine on all that
Got too much on my mind, it's time to fall back
Caught up in the grind and you trying to crawl back
My heart is in these lines, hope this markers soon be fine
I hope these models love wine and these white jacuzzi towels
Roll with the winners, Ruth's Chris dinners
All good intentions, chasing dreams, like a J O B
See me shining, now I'm on a track with GLC[Hook: YG]

If she suck it then I might have to eat something

[Hook]

[Verse 4: TC4800]

Balling, young nigga movement
Got ya bitch choosing
Bouncing all stupid, like

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Hodgy]
Save all your letters and drop your tomatoes
Hodgy Beats, where he? Looking for a large payroll
Not dimes, nickels, pennies, pesos
I'm tryna stack chips nigga, peelin' my potatoes
If I'm not the biggest boss that you've see thus far
Take a look at the exquisite luxury cars
Big ponts being stuck into a Cuban cigar
Promethazine on the leaf only to get bizarre
We don't go to the club nigga, we post at the bar
Have conversation with girls that don't know who we are
With diamonds in our ears, looking like cube stars
I live a Matrix life and we cruise hard

[Hook: Casey]
And I swear I'm a fiend, dope fiend, I'm an addict
Crack music going hard, Odd Future got a bag it
Yeah, make it stretch like bubble gum
Eh, all the little females like yummy yum

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Now ugly girls get out, the light skinned girls about
Without a doubt you niggas don't amount to shit, no need to count
Now bring the ruler out like Rick the Ruler paid in full
I'm cooler than your cooler, got these hoes, now where's my garden tool
Fuck 'em all, all them fuck with the Future
I back with Thrash Hard backyard beach cruiser, look
You niggas can't contain the thoughts that's flowin' in my brain
It synthesizes schitzo neutron from steering paper plane
And the white girls love me and the haters shove me
And push me until I beat the pussy up like it was ugly
And that's without the loot, niggas take the time to tune
The diamond dolla's, bitch I'm complex like Einstein's Rubix Cube
Look, I'm the truth, now stop daring me
Niggas kill yourself and decide to go back to therapy
And my right is right, my right is left, my left is wrong
Now bitches throw your fucking bras off while I'll be writin' my songs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Gimme a couple commas while I abreviate
The war between the pen and paper I alleviate
Alexander is Hodgy, cause I can be the Great
As long as I have a hundred mill' in the cheese steak
In a big breifcase like I won a sweepstakes
Odd Future got money out the ass for G's sakes
I feel like I can fly without wings on my back
This is crack with me, but this crack ain't whack
I got niggas hooked, yeah, the stadium packed
And I flip that like a gymnasium mat
His grind time, and I'm making it stretch
Why get less for more when you can get more for less
Pure for less, down, five three 18 thousand impression
If you comprehend what I recommend press send
If you comprehend what I recommend, Odd Future

[Hook]
