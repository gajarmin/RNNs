[Intro: Judge (Lawyer) {Woman}]
{They killed my baby, oh God they killed my baby}
Order in the court, order in the court
{I will make you pay for this you murderers}
[I said order in the court now
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendants please rise and approach the bench
(Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
Can you please explain to the court how these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen]

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
Bear witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Giving niggas brain dimples
Dragging their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leaving one element to autops'
First I'll assassinate him, and them I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate him
I'll creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't tryna hear it
Buck buck buck, I'll give your ass a holy spirit

[Break: Judge (Poetic)]
(Stressful, try to avoid all my impure thoughts, I am losing my mind
And it seems I don’t know what’s true or dream)
Can you please explain to the court
When these problems first began?]

[Verse 2: RZA]
The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil jinn
I realize my ideas have spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands feet to the form of a cross
Ahh!! I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my faith
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape

[Break: Judge (jury)]
(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)
Calm down people, please calm down
Let us please proceed with the defendants' explanation ]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scanning
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* took his fucking ass to the fucking core
(ahhh!!)

[Verse 4: Frukwan]
Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some moreand watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger up Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz

[Outro: Judge]
Guilty, next case[Chorus: RZA]
Danger Danger, Danger Danger
The Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger, Danger Danger, Danger Danger
The Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger, Danger Danger
Enter the Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger Stranger is major
Enter the Graveyard Chamber

[Verse 1: Poetic]
Ahh, you're alone
The night is dark you feel fear
You're lost, cold and confused
Uttering prayers
Afraid of the beast that stalk the earth
You're praying to Jesus if cross don't work (ha ha ha)
I've seen your type before
You read all the laws but scared to go to war
Timid and frail blind faith got ya geesed
You scorn the truth and adorn your beliefs
Are you aware son
There's nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Grymreap comes with my dangerous tongue
I'm outta control like young kids with guns
Words distorted in a murderous thoughts
My profile is nasty as maggots in pork
I'm dark and damp, enough to rust amps
With the jaws of a vampire with rusty clamps

Partial Chorus

[Verse 2: Dreddy Krueger]
I be the Bushwick dutchmaster rapper
I love black women and I hate fucking crackers
Check me yo
My breath stink cause I smoke skunk punk
Everyday of the month
In a dutchmaster fucking blunt
Bust the cliché
Niggas talking he-say-she-say about me
Ya bitch-ass-niggas
Y'all not ass, y'all titty
Y'all style is shitty
How dare you try to represent New York fuckin City
I been down since BVDs and dew rags
Shelltops and shag
I was the little badass with regular and tre bags
Always trying to get shit I never had
Cause times is bad like luck
That's why I don't give a fuck
I dig up my nose and my butt
On the bus or the train
This is for niggas walking in the rain
Listening to they Walkman(e)
Talking the New York fucking slang

Partial Chorus

[Verse 3: RZA]
In the streets of New York
Bullshit walk,cream talks
I be the giant on the top of your beanstalk
Waving Iron flags
Bagging crab niggas with bloody rags
Holdin fat bags
Takin heavy drags
Then I add more shells to the mags
Shots goin off you getin caught like tag
The diamond crystal I be rippin up your flesh tissue
And have my pitbull lockin on your bone gristle
Castin shadows in every battle
I rabble words like scrabble
Drag your brain through the gravel
At the speed of sound the rhyme travel
Allow me to dabble
With a flow that's infallable
Maintain your order
Cause once I slaughter
I destroyed a
Whole city like Soddom and Gomorrah
Or Babylon
I'm runnin shit like a marathon
Niggas frontin Don
With a set like Frank Avalon

[Verse 4: Shabazz the Disciple]
Shabazz is here to cause panic
Another fucking madman born to the planet
Sending niggas to the pearly gates
I'm psyched out
I got screws loose like Norman Bates
Shoot shit up like it's a gallery
Blowing snakes heads off to earn me a salary
Devils choke from the gun smoke
Once I'm provoked
I shove a fifth long down ya throat
And let ya taste the steel
Another body unidentified
Shit for the Potter's field
Ya punk ass'll get out dramad
I'm swelling devil's melons for my man Fard Muhammad
Get a crew and try to surround me
And one by one I'll light y'all up
And send ya asses to King's County
Sort of the morgue supplier
Ya want a nigga bang
Fuck Spenser, 'Bazz for hire

[Verse 5: Frukwan]
Make room the masculine Gatekeeper
Kicks suspense in a terrified form
To keep you warm
You're tensed up
Niggas get wrenched up
On a rack
Limbs are whiplashed
Bodies are getting smashed
So let the volcano blow and erupt
Destruction crept on
Niggas are getting flipped on
Yeah coming after ya, huh
I only got half a ya
Other part froze in Alaska
While define the feast a high beam
Ghost of a drug fiend
A physical dreams
I breathe steam
Thoughts are platonic
The chronic scripture
Angles and ripped ya
I get ya
Yo, I smash like a comet
Punish then drain ya

Partial Chorus

[Verse 6: Killah Priest]
I stalk the place like a leopard
The microphone shepherd
Is speakinh parables one and two, catch it
The brain counsellor, track fertilizer
The murdalizer
You never heard it wiser
I open heads like the archives
Allow me to explain my brain in the darkside
I strike ya beam
And watch it gleam
I'm solar
Steadfast, patient like Noah
The rap cipher
Be the enlightener
Prey upon the weak the strong I'm the sniper
And light that ass like gasoline
I dig through your chest like a jar of Vaseline
I leave your brain regurgitating and trampled
Until your rhymes are evaporated
I trip up a niggas thoughts
With a pool of zodiac signs
And I slowly attack the mind
The Killa Priest will bend your ideas
I see you cry in fear
There's no surviving here

Chorus[Verse One]
Yo! Shorty was used to being jiggy
But then he fell off and did a bid
For spanking this kid up in the city
Sitting pretty, pimping an ac and kept a stack on him
Pulled over one night and his man stashed cracks on him
See he was wanted and his fam started flipping on him
His mind was haunted cause allah put a whipping on him
Shorty was feared and respected
Known for slapping niggas and stripping them
Make them walk around the projects butt naked
Nigga remind me of the goodfellas
But deep down his snake mans wanted to knock him off
Cause they was jealous
They made a deal and got him bagged, shit was foul
He copped to manslaughter
Cause he knew he would've blew the trial
Niggas was scheming all along and got acquitted on him
His girl and his man broke in the safe and they shitted on him
And now they're living the fast life and he's hitting that ass right
And got her hooked to the glass pipe

[Hook - repeat 2X]
The game never change, only the players
While some inherit castles and thrones
Some end up death bed layers
Victims of the system and stripped mentally
Hit with 25 to life or the death penalty

[Verse Two]
6 months without a visit now he's getting worried
Up north scraping and yanking niggas for their commissary
Been down for 5, came home and still wanted that nigga dead
Got on his feet and put rewards out on that nigga head
Running 2 spots, shit was hot so he fled out of state
Cause he's out on parole and his p.o's dying to violate
His world is narrow he's paro cause he's on the run
Walking in the building
With his back against the door holding his gun
One in the pipe ready to spank something
Cutting grams with his man
Holding the blade ready to shank something
See now he's getting major money
Throwing bricks and the niggas in his clique started acting funny
He started sniffing getting high off his own supply
Shorty was slipping and his ass was about to die
Pimped his workers with high heels and a skirt
Now they're scheming to put his 10% ass in the dirt

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
He worked his way up from grinding
And scraping hand to hand on the block
And slinging rocks on consignment
He got plugged in, now he's juggling bricks and moving weight
And bubbling gats and trafficking big 8's out of the state
Faked his death and ducked the feds
But little did he know
That his ex had put a price out on his fucking head
One night she plugged him to a pick up
He's supposed to pick a brick up
She led him right into a fucking stick up
His world was spinning fast, the walls of hell were closing in
Angel of death was on his ass, his adversaries rose again
100 grand in the trunk to cop the crystal
He was sleep, that nigga in the back seat had packed a pistol
He put 2 in his kangol and twisted his wig backwards
Yanked the suitcase out the trunk, fucking snake bastard!
Left him slumped over the wheel with his wig peeled
Brains on the dashboard and blood all on the windshield
I watched him lay on his deathbed with a swollen head
Waiting for his heart to stop, cause he was brain dead
Angel of death was waiting by his bed side
He jerked his arm the next morning
And then a tear ran down his left eye
6 men carried his coffin, put him 6 feet in the ground
While I stood, 6 feet over in a black suit looking down
Thinking, why was I chose to survive and bear these memories
Fucking with that dirty game, death is always the penalty!!!!

Word! Yo R.I.P. my brother Rah, Bumpy, Junior, Herb
Know what I'm saying, just, Jeffrey, my man Stevo
They all were shot in the head!!

[Hook][Intro: Method Man]
Shout out to Morocco, what's going down?
This your boy, MEF, Mr. that is
Capital M, capital E, capital F
I'm here to speak upon things, one of your hometown favorites
My boy Cilvaringz, doing big things upon this
We gon' make it pop like this
Ya'll wanna see what time it izzy
Man, this is in the name of Allah
RZA, Shabazz the Disciple, Masta Killa
Killah Priest, your boy John-John Blazini
Let's do it

[Masta Killa:]
Listen, the wise elder spoke, write as I quote
Then open the seal, and reveal these things
That will come to pass, if you can last through the storm
Man will be tested in all forms
Then flesh will be beaten until submission
Forgiveness has been given to spare your life
Still your eyes glaze when you greet my wife
Sinful thinking, it's strong wine and drinking
Lead to the destruction of such men as Samson
The grace period given for those who will repent
Those other than righteous, Masta Killa will send
And time is at hand, as I walk the land
From the U.K., back to the streets of B.K
Given sight beyond sight, to write the unseen
No amount of treasure can measure the gift given
To speak the unspoken, it's the chosen

[Killah Priest:]
I need one cup of Dracula's blood, two virgins
Dressed in all black, to start my sermon
One heart of a merchant, one teeth of a priest
The head of a monk, mixed in a bowl, with the 9/11 souls
I see him in the sign as the reverend was told
I read the scroll, but I'm still blindfold
Wait, I need more ingredients, so I look for the seeds of disobedience
Chop off the foot of Bush, throw him in the pot, let him cook
To every word I jot in this book, I pray the FBI's overlook
The recipe for America's destiny
Tech will squeeze, after dragging, I stab him in the abdomen
Free the Palestinians, free the Africans
Free humanity from the insanity, our planet bleeds
Mission cycles of symbols and idols
Our skin put Bibles, Qu' Ran, been through temples to old mosque
Stepping through the Garden of Eden where the revengeful angels throw rods
Oh God, save us from the outrageous Pagans, I spray guns, til the barrel's empty
I'm like Moses to Pharaoh's envy, turn of the century
Burning in misery, think...

[Hook x2: Shabazz the Disciple]
In the, name of Allah, who we give thanks and praises
They turn us from the wages, watch over your saviors
He gave us life, made us upright and raised us
He wrote the book, we live according to your pages

[Killah Priest:]
When the holy father spit, you see the bottomless pit
Demons rise out, Shabazz close the door, this God's house

[Salah Edin praying]

[RZA:]
Titanium fangs, skull nearly mammal
At the holy city of Mecca, on the back of a talking camel
Grey Flannel Cologne, crazy ammo get blown
Wherever I sit son, that is my throne
I'm the reason why time started, I be the kind hearted
Trying to bust me, you aiming at a blind target
Designed with a sublime for the vintage
I control the whole, don't deal with no percentage
Even with a 3.5 mil deposit
Your life is still illusive like a CGI composite
Where your mind and your body discombobulate
Need to regenerate, let your mental seed ovulate
For nine months, in the womb of my wisdom
You may find a program to descramble the system
And cause a glitch, whether bright day or black pitch
We strive to build homes, and stack chips
From the ice of Alaska, to the heat of Calabasas
We over through the master, he build our own castle
Remove the impostor, take it up an octave
As my vibe continues to energize your chakras
Out of Allah mercy, I speak these verses
To help bring the truth from beneath the surface
To help get the proof, from beneath the churches
Defeat Shaitan, and complete the circle

[Cilvaringz:]
I move with a strike of elegance
Like Saladin on a horse, backed by seraphim
Where flowers open and my past and unruled is downhill
But see, I'm quick to the back
The fate for the house of Mecca, the stone of Abraham
My word alone will enslave a man
Deeply to the sword of Islam, though he resides with his mom
In the Pagan land, the shit's calm
Praying to the cross of Christ, what is right
But the Qu' Ran claims Christ never lost his life
To the crucified punishment of Roman justice
And that's why the Bible cannot be trusted

[Hook x2]

[Salah Edin praying]

[Outro: Shabazz the Disciple (Masta Killa)]
What up Prince Rakeem, Masta Killa, Cilvaringz
John Blaze, S.T.D., in the name of Allah
(Yo, yo, one-two, one-two, turn my mic up a little bit
Turn the headphones up just a little bit
Turn the frequency up a little, yo...)Intro:

Yeah
The once lost, disciples -- now found
Bound, together, forever

Verse One:

As I embellish, mentally I nourish
Resuscitate a mindstate that has perished, you shall inherit
His blood I require back, to Earth
We rise out of spiritual darkness, six thousand year curse
The lost disciples, bound, to the midst of the
Bottomless pit, trapped behind the gates of the wicked wilderness
I hear the sound of the trumpets, blowing across the heavens
It's calm -- prepare, for the storm, of the seven
Shabazz, the Disciple, the holy, exalter
Condemning those, who sacrificin, babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
And unmercifully slaughtered
Loud screams echo, skulls of angry slaves
Turning over in their graves
The white sheets are like white flags, you need to wave it
To the soldier, of the Lord, the warrior King David
I come to kill and crucify, those who trick and lie
In the eyes, of the most, high
The pale-face, devil race, caucasoid germ
Grafted, from original, black man's sperm
Thin-blooded weak, grafted-brain punk
Your power's a third of mine, you drunk funky skunk
How dare you use Jesus name to shell your filthy religion
My tongue be the sword, to slash you with precision
The justice system is his, the court'll only acquit him
And eighty-five percent of y'all are going to hell with him
The walls of hell, are closing in, disciples, we rose again
The Sunz of Man, chosen men
Like lightning, striking, from the East
The Holy Psychiatrist, 4th Disciple, and Killah Priest
Unlimited volts, of energy, striking, the enemy
The righteous vicinity, death be the penalty

Chorus:

So come on and swing it low, sweet chariot
Pick up your righteous load, and yo then carry it
To a new home, and i-dentity
For my people, death'll be the penalty
Uhh, and for my folks I mad a-love
Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll rise above
And yo Shabazz, make sure you sing it loud enough
Peacein out to the righteous stay rugged and rough
And y'all get on down, come on now get on down
Swing it low sweet chariot... get on down
Come on now get on down, swing it low sweet chariot

Interlude:

Lawd, I'm in this culture
The microphone and I'm joinin
Sharpen your sword, we must be aware
Them trick knowledge, they use to de-ce-ive us
You've been plagued with the mental di-se-as-es
You worship false portraits of Je-eh-s-us
The grafted image, of worshipping Ce-as-ea-r

Verse Two:

I hear the snap of my great great grandfather's neck
In a noose, hangin from a fuckin tree whipped-in mentally
Abused, visions of great great cousins
Runnin across the field, unarmed
Ran down, and killed
I be the star to dispel the darkness
Cast upon your soul by inhabitants of Mount Caucus
Who praise the dead, and not the true and living
Killed Jesus and said, that he died for their religion

Chorus

Swing it low now
Swing it low now (sweet chariot)
Swing it low now (sweet chariot)
Swing it low not (sweet chariot)
Pick up the righteous load and yo carry it[Verse 1 : Shabazz The Disciple]
Fuck your MTV cribs in my father's house is many mansions
I'm patient with the remnant while you all sambas tap dancin'
Bearing my cross in the streets I can fix your lammy
Got away I dress and go against god to get the Grammy
Tempted by the industry twice
Offered the glory of the rap kingdom
We turned them down like Christ
They high exceeding ??? the penthouse at the label
Overlooking the city contract upon the table
They tell you bend over worship me
And it's ??? for the left side of the throne
Where you be financially stable
That's the shit that made demons out of angels
Turn brooks Cain ??? there's Judas at every table
Throwin' up the ??? and triple sixes
Warlocks and witches, ??? by worldly riches
You sold your soul
You thought you walked the streets paved with gold
Now you the scarecrow on a yellow brick road

[Hook]
I know now what I didn't know then (x3)
Savor those special moments

[Verse 2 : Godfather part. III]
Everything that glitter ain't gold
??? that'll rate little children for
How you sold your soul
Fuck mind ??? tell 'em lock and load
I protect my dome
Government body surface on Bohemian road
??? reaching ??? what you grasp me for?
World ruled by evil what the future hold?
Only time I tell, so I tell to those
Never sell your soul. stay free as a bird
Always reach for the stars, motherfuck what you heard
I was told as a youth, I would never be shit
Now worldwide time my ??? infamous
And I stuck to the grit like pot, friends have a shot
Android nigga flip they turn the site clutz
And they feed to the fans all script didn't tell you
From tell-a-vision and they downloaded digital

[Hook][Intro: Hell Razah]
I was... like I pay homage to the old school
You know due credit to all the niggas out there before me
Like... youknowwhatI'msayin'? That paved the way
To hold this microphone I'm holdin' right now
We like young veterans... knowwhatI'msayin'?
So it's like, we came, we come in the game around the Biggies
And the fuckin' Jay-Z's and the 2Pac's and shit... youknowI'msayin'?

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
It all started with Preme
Back in '91, fresh on the scene
Mad Mob was the team of our Red Hook dream
We used to gun sling to get CREAM off of crack fiends
In the hallway, rollin' weed, the sunflower seeds
Thirteen when I lost my moms
Fourteen I got locked with Twin, we went to Spafford then
Fifteen they took one of my men, Big Glen
In the building, back then my pain began
Traybag had the fame of the pen, he must've seen I could win
I used to breakdance, the mad little spins
So he taught me and Sunny to write
Up in my lab late nights, rollin' dice, him, Supreme and Mike
We was live and direct to Da Last Future
For my first rhyme, and now 4th my producer
Had a style that my projects wasn't used to
Started hangin' with them drug dealers and them boosters
Up in John J rappin' in the school hallway
I got mad ass, even ask Foxy and Gav
Had the hood on smash then I linked with Bazz
We used to build and front, dazz' about fuckin' with Wu
Me and 7th did "Livin' In Hell"
Pressed up it independent, not knowin' if a record would sell
Rae and Ghost made "Heaven & Hell", while we was hearin' it
Meanwhile we thinkin' it was all coincidence
"Mental Combat", the b-side, the style: battle rap
I was rated X, next heard 'Meth vs. Chef'
Not to notice we was snake bitten
Sunz of Man did this track with the RZA "As It Was Written"
And then Nas came out with "It Was Written"
Same time "Verbal Intercourse" started hittin'

[Interlude: Hell Razah]
Basically I see it like... you know?
Like when we reflect light... youknowI'msayin'?
I expected to shine... youknowI'msayin'?
So, what it is is like a reflection of what we did, knowI'msayin'?
So like those was like little seeds of shit that we did
We planted and they didn't even know that we was plantin'
You know this beautful harvest...

[Interlude: Shabazz the Disciple]
I see it, me and Preme back, young enough
I see it...

[Verse 2: Shabazz the Disciple]
It all began at the age of sixteen
Me and my brothers Rah and Sha had a million dollar scheme
Runnin' with Kline at the time, we was gettin' that CREAM
Goin' hard under the buildings with Black and Supreme
When the scheme failed a teen went to jail, Rah got murdered
I was facin' three to nine when the jury read the verdict
On trial for a hundred and forty-four crack vials
Suited up in court, wiz pregnant with my first child
Beat the case, felt rap and started pursuin' my dream
I was the nicest in the hood, journey brought me the CREAM
The first song I recorded was "Make it or Die Trying"
In '91, way before "Get Rich or Die Trying"
We formed the Mad Mob, I filmed "Party With a Tec"
In all my videos I always rocked a bulletproof vest
Of course my Pops, Uncle Mookie got shot in the head
And Kline Sr. and Supreme just got locked in the feds
The late eighties was Hades hip-hop, save a nigga
Got discovered by the RZA, debuted with Gravediggaz
Platinum out the gate for my first verse on "Diary"
Number one on Hot 9 for three weeks, the world admired me
Toured the Holy West with the Clan, was well respected
Me and Priest got a demo deal with Atlantic Records
We both had a plan to introduce the fam
We featured Prodigal and Razah, the birth of the Sunz of Man
Rae and Ghost gave my style to the enemy
I left the situation, signed a contract with Penalty
After "Crime Saga" and "Death'll be the Penalty"
I left the label, released "Street Parables" independently
Was crowned the underground king of Europe for my show
Big Pun told me "Crime Saga" inspired his flow
In '96 I told Big Lez I'm God Son on RapCity
In '98, Nas tatted the shit across his belly

[Outro: Hell Razah]
They knew what they was doin', like...
We wanted to be different, that's what made us who we was
KnowwhatI'msayin'? We didn't wanna do the shit that the program said to do
KnowI'msayin'? So we went against the system
Everybody went with the system
That's what brought Sunz of Man together as a group
Every last individual spit some intellectual street shit
Some deep true poetic project crazy shit

[Interlude: Shabazz the Disciple]
I see it, me and Preme back, young enough
I see it...

[Verse 2: Shabazz the Disciple]
It all began at the age of sixteen
Me and my brothers Rah and Sha had a million dollar scheme
Runnin' with Kline at the time, we was gettin' that CREAM
Goin' hard under the buildings with Black and Supreme
When the scheme failed a teen went to jail, Rah got murdered
I was facin' three to nine when the jury read the verdict
On trial for a hundred and forty-four crack vials
Suited up in court, wiz pregnant with my first child
Beat the case, felt rap and started pursuin' my dream
I was the nicest in the hood, journey brought me the CREAM
The first song I recorded was "Make it or Die Trying"
In '91, way before "Get Rich or Die Trying"
We formed the Mad Mob, I filmed "Party With a Tec"
In all my videos I always rocked a bulletproof vest
Of course my Pops, Uncle Mookie got shot in the head
And Kline Sr. and Supreme just got locked in the feds
The late eighties was Hades hip-hop, save a nigga
Got discovered by the RZA, debuted with Gravediggaz
Platinum out the gate for my first verse on "Diary"
Number one on Hot 9 for three weeks, the world admired me
Toured the Holy West with the Clan, was well respected
Me and Priest got a demo deal with Atlantic Records
We both had a plan to introduce the fam
We featured Prodigal and Razah, the birth of the Sunz of Man
Rae and Ghost gave my style to the enemy
I left the situation, signed a contract with Penalty
After "Crime Saga" and "Death'll be the Penalty"
I left the label, released "Street Parables" independently
Was crowned the underground king of Europe for my show
Big Pun told me "Crime Saga" inspired his flow
In '96 I told Big Lez I'm God Son on RapCity
In '98, Nas tatted the shit across his belly

[Outro: Hell Razah]
They knew what they was doin', like...
We wanted to be different, that's what made us who we was
KnowwhatI'msayin'? We didn't wanna do the shit that the program said to do
KnowI'msayin'? So we went against the system
Everybody went with the system
That's what brought Sunz of Man together as a group
Every last individual spit some intellectual street shit
Some deep true poetic project crazy shit

[Shabazz The Disciple]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
When I was young, I made an oath and it was solemn
To scrape my way from being broke without hitting the Island
Me and my mans we juggled coke we used to get from Harlem
And jealous brothers on the block, they tried to give us problems and
I started you, yanking jewels on the A train
Til they blew out my man's brains, then i changed games
Yea, I remember that long ride through that dark tunnel
All I could remember is cucci's head laying in the puddle
Keep hearing clicks from that empty barrel
Feeling my soul leave my body, am I in the air, getting narrower?
See up until that day my life was physical in my mental
Keep thinking I'm returning as the spiritual
It's like I'm living in a soul's journey after death
I keep praising Allah that he sparred my breath
Me and my mans, we had plans to get grands
Drink champagne, they was slanging the game
And that's a damn shame
Holding the tech and the firebomb
In '82's back-staircase, bubbling and quoting Islam
Three in the morning, puffing L's and drinking the VincTop
Scheming and thinking of a way to catch a Brink's truck
Then all those times we sent you booking
And watching niggas get their shit tooken
Facing drug charges for not looking
Cooking them grams of yayo, they didn't play, yo
Then most rappers got out the game, then hey yo
Yo, when they murdered my main man, I was hurt
I'd go into their graves and bust some shots at the dirt
Some little thugs with a vision to count a bill
Cuz made brothers got their wigs peeled on Sugar Hill
In '87 weighing grams and splitting the prophets
Now in '96, I read the caron and study the projects
It's like I'm living on the ground, my mind is haunted
Keep hearing whispers in the dark cause my soul is wanted
Spiritual wounds never heal from a fast life
I ask Christ to forgive me for me past life
Spinning the wheel to get the fortune
Some brothers got banked up, locked up or ended up in a coffin
Red Hook was up, most of my mans with bullet wounds
At a young age, I never shot no one
But I know I'mma have the bullet soon
Mad times I was surrounded by death
Brothers, they'd put up guns to my head - click, no bullets left
Yo, I could still taste that steel from that double barrel
When brothers stuck me up under the building, my will got narrower
Stuck to the forehead, with two pistols, I saw red
If it was for Ra and Chuck, I would've ended up in the morgue dead
I never got the chance to return Ra's blessing
Now he's in the essence, my brother's eternally resting
He used to envision ruling this industry
So I kept the dream alive and signed a contract with Penalty
Now I'm negociating deals over meals
Plus playing the game of fortune and fame by Bobby Steels
The gambino latino without Mossimo
In a hip hop casino, cooking albums I split 'em like a kilo'
I'm trying to sell 900,000, move my moms out of public housing
Be in the yacht showroom browsing
Before my journey after life, I'mma get even for you
Your spirit lives inside my body and I'm breathing for you

(Because I'm breathing for you baby
Because I'm breathing for you baby, yeah, yeah
Because I'm breathing for you baby)
Before my journey after life, I'mma get even for you
(Breathing, cuz I'm breathing for you)
Your spirit lives inside my body and I'm breathing for you
(Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha
Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha
Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha)
I'm breathing for you, yes, I'm breathing for you
(Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha
Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha
Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha)
Before my journey after life, I'mma get even for you
Your spirit lives inside my body and I'm breathing for you
(Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha
Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha
Shabazz is breathing for you, ha, ha, ha, hi, hi, hi, ha)
'96, lieutenant, Supreme and counted[Verse One]
Yo! Shorty was used to being jiggy
But then he fell off and did a bid
For spanking this kid up in the city
Sitting pretty, pimping an ac and kept a stack on him
Pulled over one night and his man stashed cracks on him
See he was wanted and his fam started flipping on him
His mind was haunted cause allah put a whipping on him
Shorty was feared and respected
Known for slapping niggas and stripping them
Make them walk around the projects butt naked
Nigga remind me of the goodfellas
But deep down his snake mans wanted to knock him off
Cause they was jealous
They made a deal and got him bagged, shit was foul
He copped to manslaughter
Cause he knew he would've blew the trial
Niggas was scheming all along and got acquitted on him
His girl and his man broke in the safe and they shitted on him
And now they're living the fast life and he's hitting that ass right
And got her hooked to the glass pipe

[Hook - repeat 2X]
The game never change, only the players
While some inherit castles and thrones
Some end up death bed layers
Victims of the system and stripped mentally
Hit with 25 to life or the death penalty

[Verse Two]
6 months without a visit now he's getting worried
Up north scraping and yanking niggas for their commissary
Been down for 5, came home and still wanted that nigga dead
Got on his feet and put rewards out on that nigga head
Running 2 spots, shit was hot so he fled out of state
Cause he's out on parole and his p.o's dying to violate
His world is narrow he's paro cause he's on the run
Walking in the building
With his back against the door holding his gun
One in the pipe ready to spank something
Cutting grams with his man
Holding the blade ready to shank something
See now he's getting major money
Throwing bricks and the niggas in his clique started acting funny
He started sniffing getting high off his own supply
Shorty was slipping and his ass was about to die
Pimped his workers with high heels and a skirt
Now they're scheming to put his 10% ass in the dirt

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
He worked his way up from grinding
And scraping hand to hand on the block
And slinging rocks on consignment
He got plugged in, now he's juggling bricks and moving weight
And bubbling gats and trafficking big 8's out of the state
Faked his death and ducked the feds
But little did he know
That his ex had put a price out on his fucking head
One night she plugged him to a pick up
He's supposed to pick a brick up
She led him right into a fucking stick up
His world was spinning fast, the walls of hell were closing in
Angel of death was on his ass, his adversaries rose again
100 grand in the trunk to cop the crystal
He was sleep, that nigga in the back seat had packed a pistol
He put 2 in his kangol and twisted his wig backwards
Yanked the suitcase out the trunk, fucking snake bastard!
Left him slumped over the wheel with his wig peeled
Brains on the dashboard and blood all on the windshield
I watched him lay on his deathbed with a swollen head
Waiting for his heart to stop, cause he was brain dead
Angel of death was waiting by his bed side
He jerked his arm the next morning
And then a tear ran down his left eye
6 men carried his coffin, put him 6 feet in the ground
While I stood, 6 feet over in a black suit looking down
Thinking, why was I chose to survive and bear these memories
Fucking with that dirty game, death is always the penalty!!!!

Word! Yo R.I.P. my brother Rah, Bumpy, Junior, Herb
Know what I'm saying, just, Jeffrey, my man Stevo
They all were shot in the head!!

[Hook]Intro:

Yeah
The once lost, disciples -- now found
Bound, together, forever

Verse One:

As I embellish, mentally I nourish
Resuscitate a mindstate that has perished, you shall inherit
His blood I require back, to Earth
We rise out of spiritual darkness, six thousand year curse
The lost disciples, bound, to the midst of the
Bottomless pit, trapped behind the gates of the wicked wilderness
I hear the sound of the trumpets, blowing across the heavens
It's calm -- prepare, for the storm, of the seven
Shabazz, the Disciple, the holy, exalter
Condemning those, who sacrificin, babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
And unmercifully slaughtered
Loud screams echo, skulls of angry slaves
Turning over in their graves
The white sheets are like white flags, you need to wave it
To the soldier, of the Lord, the warrior King David
I come to kill and crucify, those who trick and lie
In the eyes, of the most, high
The pale-face, devil race, caucasoid germ
Grafted, from original, black man's sperm
Thin-blooded weak, grafted-brain punk
Your power's a third of mine, you drunk funky skunk
How dare you use Jesus name to shell your filthy religion
My tongue be the sword, to slash you with precision
The justice system is his, the court'll only acquit him
And eighty-five percent of y'all are going to hell with him
The walls of hell, are closing in, disciples, we rose again
The Sunz of Man, chosen men
Like lightning, striking, from the East
The Holy Psychiatrist, 4th Disciple, and Killah Priest
Unlimited volts, of energy, striking, the enemy
The righteous vicinity, death be the penalty

Chorus:

So come on and swing it low, sweet chariot
Pick up your righteous load, and yo then carry it
To a new home, and i-dentity
For my people, death'll be the penalty
Uhh, and for my folks I mad a-love
Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll rise above
And yo Shabazz, make sure you sing it loud enough
Peacein out to the righteous stay rugged and rough
And y'all get on down, come on now get on down
Swing it low sweet chariot... get on down
Come on now get on down, swing it low sweet chariot

Interlude:

Lawd, I'm in this culture
The microphone and I'm joinin
Sharpen your sword, we must be aware
Them trick knowledge, they use to de-ce-ive us
You've been plagued with the mental di-se-as-es
You worship false portraits of Je-eh-s-us
The grafted image, of worshipping Ce-as-ea-r

Verse Two:

I hear the snap of my great great grandfather's neck
In a noose, hangin from a fuckin tree whipped-in mentally
Abused, visions of great great cousins
Runnin across the field, unarmed
Ran down, and killed
I be the star to dispel the darkness
Cast upon your soul by inhabitants of Mount Caucus
Who praise the dead, and not the true and living
Killed Jesus and said, that he died for their religion

Chorus

Swing it low now
Swing it low now (sweet chariot)
Swing it low now (sweet chariot)
Swing it low not (sweet chariot)
Pick up the righteous load and yo carry it[Intro: Judge (Lawyer) {Woman}]
{They killed my baby, oh God they killed my baby}
Order in the court, order in the court
{I will make you pay for this you murderers}
[I said order in the court now
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendants please rise and approach the bench
(Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
Can you please explain to the court how these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen]

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
Bear witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Giving niggas brain dimples
Dragging their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leaving one element to autops'
First I'll assassinate him, and them I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate him
I'll creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't tryna hear it
Buck buck buck, I'll give your ass a holy spirit

[Break: Judge (Poetic)]
(Stressful, try to avoid all my impure thoughts, I am losing my mind
And it seems I don’t know what’s true or dream)
Can you please explain to the court
When these problems first began?]

[Verse 2: RZA]
The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil jinn
I realize my ideas have spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands feet to the form of a cross
Ahh!! I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my faith
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape

[Break: Judge (jury)]
(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)
Calm down people, please calm down
Let us please proceed with the defendants' explanation ]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scanning
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* took his fucking ass to the fucking core
(ahhh!!)

[Verse 4: Frukwan]
Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some moreand watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger up Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz

[Outro: Judge]
Guilty, next case[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

[Killah Priest]
I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to kosher a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear... be the holy wizard

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
The triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevent to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

[Hell Razah]
Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man wanna live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

[Prodical]
Cryin deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
Of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin
Experimentin with all types of fuckin gases
I got the potion to turn your flesh to fuckin acid
Atoms Shatter, and lemons start to scatter
Illusion dwellin in path for mental confusion[Shabazz the Disciple]
This be that shit for the ghetto
Shabazz the Disciple, Marcelo

[Marcelo D2]
Rio de Janeiro, Nova york, Andaraí, Brooklyn
É como uma selva de pedras, Shabazz

[Shabazz the Disciple]
The Concrete Jungle, some niggas is poor, some niggas stackin' bundles

[Verso 1:Shabazz the Disciple]
Yo son, where I'm from is off the hinges
Even niggas is smokin, sniffin, shooting that shit up with syringes
Hustlers profiting off amphetamines

[Verso 2: Marcelo D2]
Eu vim do Rio de Janeiro à Nova York levado pelo som
No Andaraí, no Brooklyn, só tem sangue-bom
Vou te explicar como é que eu faço pra sair dessa merda
Eu tô sempre ligado, e mantenho minha mente aberta
Com dinheiro é muito fácil, todo mundo é feliz
Eu quero vê tira onda sem dinheiro como eu fiz
Eu tiro onda não é porque eu como muitas minas
é pq eu continuo vivo e dessa daqui ninguém me tira
Oh, Oh, Não ri pra mim não amigo
Eu tô falando sério, tudo que eu quero é ficar longe de um cemitério
O critério é da morte você ficar longe
Com camisinha, com droga ou na mão dos Homens
O bom malandro sabe o que quer
Se você não sabe, tá tirando onda de Mané
Assim como Mussum da Mangueira eu não espero o sistema
Eu corro atrás e faço meu esquema
No microfone então, não tem competição
Ainda mais quando eu me junto com os meus irmãos
Ouvir o Hip Hop é uma coisa normal
Entender o Hip Hop é onde está o mal
É como uma selva de pedras, mas no fundo eu tiro onda e te repito
Eu nunca durmo na ronda
Mas se eu tô com os camaradas então tá tudo tranquilo
é bom ficar ligado e vem corre perigo
Se eu saio na balada o que eu quero é Paz
Vamos direto ao assunto, deixa de leva e trás
E se você ainda não conhece eu vou apresentar Marcelo D2
E meu cumpádi Shabazz

[Refrão]
Por isso que eu tiro é onda, eu tô de pé e nunca durmo na ronda

É isso aí, eu também sobrevivi à essa guerra Marcelo D2, Rio de Janeiro
Eu tiro onda, porque eu contrario a estatística, entendeu?
Então é melhor andar na linha, mas cuidado porque o trêm tá pronto pra te foder
Em português ou inglês a luta é a mesma, mantenha-se vivo e paz[Hook]
Yo! we win the war cause we bomb first
It's like when napalm bursts, snipers with the Vietnam verse
Ghetto apostles doing god's work, boots and camouflage shirts
Marching through your trenches and your concerts
We win the war cause we bomb first
It's like when napalm bursts, snipers with the Vietnam verse
Ghetto apostles doing god's work, boots and camouflage shirts
Marching through your trenches and your concerts

[Verse 1: Shabazz]
I'm that guerilla in your midst, stalking with an army of assailants
I got your organization under surveillence
You moved your pawn two squares, left the king unveilled
Diagonal invasion, souljahz marching in for the kill
This is a war join ranks, play your position
Put the industry in checkmate, force them under submission
Ya whole perimeter's surrounded by my legion
You're trapped inside the center of an isolated region
Chk!, blaugh!!!, glass shatters, bullets scatter
No evidence or fingerprints a c12 matter
Black bishop moving in, attack the queen
Sabotage front line, the industry's in quarantine

[Verse 2: R.H. Bless]
This is your final call, prepare for violent storms, a silent war
Map your survival course
Mount ya riding horse and grab ya sword
Hip-Hop's a holocaust, grab ya holy cross, ya crescent and star
Witness ya empire fall like Sodom and Gomorrah
Refer to ya bibles, Qu'ran and Torah
Bless, I be the high exalter, divine curer, who mind is purer
Staring in my rivals eyes, I analyze, cross examine and paralyze
All those who choose to itemize lies

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freestyle]
Continued infiltration by fire bomb detination
Phasers and lasers scopin, choking from smoke inhilation
Secret service agents are coming at me
I gotta hit em I sprayed, throw a grenade
Setting off the sprinkler system

[Verse 4: Poetic]
I specialize in fear, terrorizing your airwaves
Like dropping off thermo-nuclear bombs in subways
Here to stress ya life, painting pictures of death
Ancient scriptures rip ya silhouette, I'm cold as winter
Bringing the earth tremors that burst ya inner sanctum
I sank men of war then haha, laughed at how I banged them
Foes coppin a plea, should've took the opportunity to flee
I bring terror to fields like the phantom
My thoughts reveal a navy seal approaching ghetto wars
Enemies force field jackets get stained from open sores
Non-negotiable term for your surrender
I heat ya weak arsinol, and burn men to cinders

[Hook]

[Freestyle]
Rendevous, special operations: team arsonists
Switch the disk and get out of there fast
We don't wanna take no risk
Code name: freestyle, alias "the asthmatic"
Automatic full metal jackets
Static's with the diplomatic, bureaucratic tactics
We got the area secured now, triple the c-4
And get of the whole floor, you copy?
I copy that, we got the whole music business wired
So when this shit blow, ya whole empire's expired

[R.H. Bless]
We can live lavish and still build on the mathematics
Far precise, cut cabbage, rock ice and still civilize a savage

[Shabazz]
Dancin in the Garden of Eden, gotta thank Allah I'm breathin
Glancin back at days I used to be behind them bars with heathens

[Poetic]
Flash like the Aztecs, cash checks, blast tecs
Collect all of my assets from sales from the cassettes

[Freestyle]
Iceless but priceless, top of the price list
Probably the 1st up on ya heist list
Ya might miss, so knowledge this...[Chorus: RZA]
Danger Danger, Danger Danger
The Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger, Danger Danger, Danger Danger
The Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger, Danger Danger
Enter the Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger Stranger is major
Enter the Graveyard Chamber

[Verse 1: Poetic]
Ahh, you're alone
The night is dark you feel fear
You're lost, cold and confused
Uttering prayers
Afraid of the beast that stalk the earth
You're praying to Jesus if cross don't work (ha ha ha)
I've seen your type before
You read all the laws but scared to go to war
Timid and frail blind faith got ya geesed
You scorn the truth and adorn your beliefs
Are you aware son
There's nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Grymreap comes with my dangerous tongue
I'm outta control like young kids with guns
Words distorted in a murderous thoughts
My profile is nasty as maggots in pork
I'm dark and damp, enough to rust amps
With the jaws of a vampire with rusty clamps

Partial Chorus

[Verse 2: Dreddy Krueger]
I be the Bushwick dutchmaster rapper
I love black women and I hate fucking crackers
Check me yo
My breath stink cause I smoke skunk punk
Everyday of the month
In a dutchmaster fucking blunt
Bust the cliché
Niggas talking he-say-she-say about me
Ya bitch-ass-niggas
Y'all not ass, y'all titty
Y'all style is shitty
How dare you try to represent New York fuckin City
I been down since BVDs and dew rags
Shelltops and shag
I was the little badass with regular and tre bags
Always trying to get shit I never had
Cause times is bad like luck
That's why I don't give a fuck
I dig up my nose and my butt
On the bus or the train
This is for niggas walking in the rain
Listening to they Walkman(e)
Talking the New York fucking slang

Partial Chorus

[Verse 3: RZA]
In the streets of New York
Bullshit walk,cream talks
I be the giant on the top of your beanstalk
Waving Iron flags
Bagging crab niggas with bloody rags
Holdin fat bags
Takin heavy drags
Then I add more shells to the mags
Shots goin off you getin caught like tag
The diamond crystal I be rippin up your flesh tissue
And have my pitbull lockin on your bone gristle
Castin shadows in every battle
I rabble words like scrabble
Drag your brain through the gravel
At the speed of sound the rhyme travel
Allow me to dabble
With a flow that's infallable
Maintain your order
Cause once I slaughter
I destroyed a
Whole city like Soddom and Gomorrah
Or Babylon
I'm runnin shit like a marathon
Niggas frontin Don
With a set like Frank Avalon

[Verse 4: Shabazz the Disciple]
Shabazz is here to cause panic
Another fucking madman born to the planet
Sending niggas to the pearly gates
I'm psyched out
I got screws loose like Norman Bates
Shoot shit up like it's a gallery
Blowing snakes heads off to earn me a salary
Devils choke from the gun smoke
Once I'm provoked
I shove a fifth long down ya throat
And let ya taste the steel
Another body unidentified
Shit for the Potter's field
Ya punk ass'll get out dramad
I'm swelling devil's melons for my man Fard Muhammad
Get a crew and try to surround me
And one by one I'll light y'all up
And send ya asses to King's County
Sort of the morgue supplier
Ya want a nigga bang
Fuck Spenser, 'Bazz for hire

[Verse 5: Frukwan]
Make room the masculine Gatekeeper
Kicks suspense in a terrified form
To keep you warm
You're tensed up
Niggas get wrenched up
On a rack
Limbs are whiplashed
Bodies are getting smashed
So let the volcano blow and erupt
Destruction crept on
Niggas are getting flipped on
Yeah coming after ya, huh
I only got half a ya
Other part froze in Alaska
While define the feast a high beam
Ghost of a drug fiend
A physical dreams
I breathe steam
Thoughts are platonic
The chronic scripture
Angles and ripped ya
I get ya
Yo, I smash like a comet
Punish then drain ya

Partial Chorus

[Verse 6: Killah Priest]
I stalk the place like a leopard
The microphone shepherd
Is speakinh parables one and two, catch it
The brain counsellor, track fertilizer
The murdalizer
You never heard it wiser
I open heads like the archives
Allow me to explain my brain in the darkside
I strike ya beam
And watch it gleam
I'm solar
Steadfast, patient like Noah
The rap cipher
Be the enlightener
Prey upon the weak the strong I'm the sniper
And light that ass like gasoline
I dig through your chest like a jar of Vaseline
I leave your brain regurgitating and trampled
Until your rhymes are evaporated
I trip up a niggas thoughts
With a pool of zodiac signs
And I slowly attack the mind
The Killa Priest will bend your ideas
I see you cry in fear
There's no surviving here

Chorus[Hook: repeat 2X]
Hip pop, they tap dance to sell a mil
While real emcees with skills don't got a deal
It's industry conspiracy to make us savage
Take off ya clothes to go gold, sell ya soul to live lavish

[Verse One]
It seems every man wanna be a pop star
It's obvious to me that you forgot who you are
These labels will have you wearing high heels and a bra
Cut the roots to ya tree and watch ya empire fall
Now hip hop is a tree, and trees live by their roots
All the roots live underground, water down me no salute!
They pimping the culture, the same vulture who stole ya agriculture
My vocab is ultra, I insult ya or nurture ya sculpture
It's like to get a record deal, you gotta get naked and kneel
Labels ain't checking for skills no more, they want sex appeal
No publishing checks in the mail
Don't you know when you become a slave to money
That's when you destined to fail
You swallowing so you can sell a million records
On magazine front covers butt naked
Used to be a queen who was highly respected
Now when I listen to ya album, shit get ejected
I didn't get the album out, somebody cock blocked it
In 99 I smacked the blackball right in the side pocket
When I drop it take ya plaque to the pawn shop and hock it
I'm taking all y'all money this year, extorting ya profit
Y'all got greedy and went commercial
And ya label's still jerking you
I'm starving all y'all niggas this year, take it personal

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Fuck riding in limos nigga copyright ya demos
Cause they shiesty, labels are shiesty
Ya manager's stroking you, saying shows are promotional
Cause they shiesty, niggas are shiesty
Stupid, the main niggas who helped you get on
The first niggas you shit on
You'll realize who love you when all ya money's giddone
They're smiling in ya face
Cause right now you're putting cake on their plate
Them the same niggas that's scheming on ya safe - word!
It's the ones that sniff coke witcha, from broke to richer
Now they wanna cut ya throat and come and getcha
Ya fake acapellas can't really rock a farvela crowd
Ya head is full of helium, you floating in the clouds
On stage fronting like the solo type
Cloned my hip hop chromosomes, deep down you know Shabazz ya prototype
Don't even know how to hold the mic, trippin over the cables
Mumbling and stumbling into the turntables
Tap dancing, juggling, shuffling their feet smiling
The type of niggas I be snuffing while their freestyling
Whether you're gold or you're platinum, I'm robbing and gatting them
And slapping them with an aluminum bat and busting a cap in them
Duct taping and gagging them, make 'em deep throat the magnum
Trapping them in alleys, where we're beating stomping and dragging them
Fuck selling my soul for that mansion and a yacht
I'd rather make salat and scrape the bottom of the pot
Real soldiers survive with 3 hots and a cot
You can't take them riches in the ground when you rot
Must have forgot, ya fans bought you to that altitude
And now you left them astray, ego got you confused
Son I be browsing, they tryna trap us all in public housing
How niggas classic albums only sell 200 thousand
Labels be running sound scams on ya cream
That makes niggas susceptible on going mainstream, they pulling ya strings
With marketing schemes extorting the fiends
They ain't gonna never tell you how many records you sold seen
Peace to all emcees staying true to their root
Don't sell their soul for the loot
And planting seeds in the youth and fuck the

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hip pop, hip pop, hip pop we shoot
Empires will fall when you cut the trees root
Hip pop, hip pop, hip pop we shoot
Empires will fall when you cut the trees root[Intro: Method Man]
Shout out to Morocco, what's going down?
This your boy, MEF, Mr. that is
Capital M, capital E, capital F
I'm here to speak upon things, one of your hometown favorites
My boy Cilvaringz, doing big things upon this
We gon' make it pop like this
Ya'll wanna see what time it izzy
Man, this is in the name of Allah
RZA, Shabazz the Disciple, Masta Killa
Killah Priest, your boy John-John Blazini
Let's do it

[Masta Killa:]
Listen, the wise elder spoke, write as I quote
Then open the seal, and reveal these things
That will come to pass, if you can last through the storm
Man will be tested in all forms
Then flesh will be beaten until submission
Forgiveness has been given to spare your life
Still your eyes glaze when you greet my wife
Sinful thinking, it's strong wine and drinking
Lead to the destruction of such men as Samson
The grace period given for those who will repent
Those other than righteous, Masta Killa will send
And time is at hand, as I walk the land
From the U.K., back to the streets of B.K
Given sight beyond sight, to write the unseen
No amount of treasure can measure the gift given
To speak the unspoken, it's the chosen

[Killah Priest:]
I need one cup of Dracula's blood, two virgins
Dressed in all black, to start my sermon
One heart of a merchant, one teeth of a priest
The head of a monk, mixed in a bowl, with the 9/11 souls
I see him in the sign as the reverend was told
I read the scroll, but I'm still blindfold
Wait, I need more ingredients, so I look for the seeds of disobedience
Chop off the foot of Bush, throw him in the pot, let him cook
To every word I jot in this book, I pray the FBI's overlook
The recipe for America's destiny
Tech will squeeze, after dragging, I stab him in the abdomen
Free the Palestinians, free the Africans
Free humanity from the insanity, our planet bleeds
Mission cycles of symbols and idols
Our skin put Bibles, Qu' Ran, been through temples to old mosque
Stepping through the Garden of Eden where the revengeful angels throw rods
Oh God, save us from the outrageous Pagans, I spray guns, til the barrel's empty
I'm like Moses to Pharaoh's envy, turn of the century
Burning in misery, think...

[Hook x2: Shabazz the Disciple]
In the, name of Allah, who we give thanks and praises
They turn us from the wages, watch over your saviors
He gave us life, made us upright and raised us
He wrote the book, we live according to your pages

[Killah Priest:]
When the holy father spit, you see the bottomless pit
Demons rise out, Shabazz close the door, this God's house

[Salah Edin praying]

[RZA:]
Titanium fangs, skull nearly mammal
At the holy city of Mecca, on the back of a talking camel
Grey Flannel Cologne, crazy ammo get blown
Wherever I sit son, that is my throne
I'm the reason why time started, I be the kind hearted
Trying to bust me, you aiming at a blind target
Designed with a sublime for the vintage
I control the whole, don't deal with no percentage
Even with a 3.5 mil deposit
Your life is still illusive like a CGI composite
Where your mind and your body discombobulate
Need to regenerate, let your mental seed ovulate
For nine months, in the womb of my wisdom
You may find a program to descramble the system
And cause a glitch, whether bright day or black pitch
We strive to build homes, and stack chips
From the ice of Alaska, to the heat of Calabasas
We over through the master, he build our own castle
Remove the impostor, take it up an octave
As my vibe continues to energize your chakras
Out of Allah mercy, I speak these verses
To help bring the truth from beneath the surface
To help get the proof, from beneath the churches
Defeat Shaitan, and complete the circle

[Cilvaringz:]
I move with a strike of elegance
Like Saladin on a horse, backed by seraphim
Where flowers open and my past and unruled is downhill
But see, I'm quick to the back
The fate for the house of Mecca, the stone of Abraham
My word alone will enslave a man
Deeply to the sword of Islam, though he resides with his mom
In the Pagan land, the shit's calm
Praying to the cross of Christ, what is right
But the Qu' Ran claims Christ never lost his life
To the crucified punishment of Roman justice
And that's why the Bible cannot be trusted

[Hook x2]

[Salah Edin praying]

[Outro: Shabazz the Disciple (Masta Killa)]
What up Prince Rakeem, Masta Killa, Cilvaringz
John Blaze, S.T.D., in the name of Allah
(Yo, yo, one-two, one-two, turn my mic up a little bit
Turn the headphones up just a little bit
Turn the frequency up a little, yo...)[Verse One]
Yo it was all a dream, me and my brothers shakim and rahkeem
Up black crib puffin l's seeing ourselves on the screen
Our pictures in a magazine, we up in a limousine
In suede bally's, silk shirts and jeans with the Gucci seams
I beat boxed and niggas flow till we was dizzy
My manager Mo, Chuck, Fresh, G-Money, Wil, Louie and Wizzy
Those were my favorite days when I turn back the page
And everyday we did a show, the staircase was the stage
And yo the name of the group: it was "RAHSHASHA"
Whoever thought that hip hop would make it this far
At 16 we did our first real show at the miccio
My mother believed in us, she shot our first video
We would go to my uncle young's house every sunday
He let us do our thang, we had a hot tape on monday
I love them both for that, they always had my back
They made me who I am today, I see that when I look back
Red Hook day gave me the confidence to do what I do
Mr. Gus, Stephen Moore, 9-2 Crash Crew
RZA seen what it took the world time to see
I dedicate this to y'all for inspiring me come on!

[Hook]
Talk to me y'all aha! aha! it's Red Hook day yall
Talk to me yall!

[Verse Two]
Hip-Hop is my religion son, music and fashion
Since I was a lil nigga yo, I do this with passion
It took me around the world from Brazil to Paris
Even on channel 2 news with my man reggie harris
Crime saga nominated soul train '96
Even though I do it son, I'm still a fan of this shit
When "BDP" said didididadiday
KRS dissed Marley Marl, Shan and Shante
And Stetsasonic had the Brooklyn anthem
We would rush a house party mob deep and vamp them
I slammed the mic when I'm done and kicked a hole in the speaker
When Rakim told Big Daddy Kane "Follow the Leader"
When Slick and Doug E. them said "La-Di-Da-Di"
When trench coats would hide the shottie to stick up the party
We was forever on that Brooklyn bullshit
My new projects posse was quick to pull shit
And fuck a fair one, you got ya head snuffed and stomped in
Back when that nigga Tim Dog made "Fuck Compton"
"Hey Young World" is my all time favorite
Even now I still sing it every time when I play it
I dedicate this to y'all for inspiring me
And all my fans around the world whose admiring me
I had the vision all my life son, I came a long way
And now the whole world's invited
I welcome y'all to Red Hook day!

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
My Uncle Cliff and Calvin Klein always knew I had the vision in mind
And one day it'll be my time to shine
Back in 1989 they bought me up to 105.9
They played my shit and it lit up the phone lines
Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see
A past time hobby about to be
Taken to the cinema screens and BET
And be blazin ON WQHT and MTV
Shit, I sacrificed my whole life for this
Everyday I roll the dice and pray to Christ for this, for real!
I sacrifice my whole life for this
Everyday I roll the dice and pray to Christ for this
Def Jam was always my favorite label
Since the days I rocked "2 TONE" leather pants and a gold cable
And "Krush Groove" showed me dreams come true
All a nigga need is passion to follow' 'em through
I love Russell Simmons he inspire me to hustle and keep swimming
And never give up the struggle, focus on winning
This year I'mma do my thang, word to "RAH" who hovers me
I'll love "Wu-Tang Forever", cause the RZA discovered me

[Hook]

Come on come on ha![Intro: samples]
The year 84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil gen
I realize my ideas has spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
[Hook]
I saw the torture brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
Repeat 2X

Or creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't trying to hear it
Buck, Buck, Buck, I'll give your ass a Holy Spirit
[Hook]
[Interlude: Brook Gima]
Shit like Deekestrelz

Find to the Kestrelz is shot, because to ass hole about the blue eighting
Gravedig fucking loser
[Godfrey Effisawey]
Shovel to shovel, died to died
Yeah yeah yeah I known storm away
Yo, go to the murderous all day to mommy
To shit brown smile to the zombie
Demon container sqaure downtown is graver
To the O ground, like a man to the saver
I'm shutin' is buttin, like a else mind to the lived
G is the lived with the murder dived
Violence to the ground, to the ground ground ground
Like a bussiness, mad this guy, like a witness

''So my brain became stained with the horror''
[Karim Kaloga]
Shovel to died, nope, last hope along
Because to dope along, dyin' to tha mong
C'mon, c'mon, let's to the g'mon
Can you like see are film like a t'mon
The KA born to the Deekestrelz last

Be to the bitch we the dead
[Christine Aspell]
Along the shovel to shovel, the styles was last blue

Revenge to graves to haves wit the darkness
Because to the park, like Johnny with the parkness
Lates fade with high five ghost to the liftin all
Talkin with me nothin in up with the giftin all
Dig up the grave with shovel like a takin are grabbin'
666 to the crabbin' (nope!!)
With the creepin alive, to the left with the didn't live
Bang your head to the bang drive
Diggin' for ghosts like don't that city boy
The Deekestrelz for the shovel with out croy
[Hook 4X]I'm 1 person
I cannot change the world
But I tell you this:
I can give you one ingredient, that you can change yourself
And if everybody change, the world will change, you understand?
What you got to do, is dig inside yourself and eliminate the negative characteristics of Satan
Cause they exist inside you


[Hook]
Leviathan got the ghetto in the death hold
You better lace the lamb's blood on ya threshold
I march in ranks with a vexed soul
All them soldiers that were slain in the field, God bless ya soul!

Leviathan got the ghetto in the death hold
You better lace the lamb's blood on ya threshold
I march in ranks with a vexed soul
To all the soldiers that were slain in the field, God bless ya soul!

[Verse 1]
This be the opening of the 7th seal
I'm storming down like the plague of hail
Avenge the innocent blood spilled, the king of israel
The earth was given to his hand to trick it
I'm the mighty lion in the thicket, who be spying on the wicked
In these last days, the projects is like the caves
Facing the 10 plagues, like moses I free slaves
I broke bread in the den of sinners, and done the whore toast
During the plague of sores
The lamb's blood was on my door post
The sinner gog the pagan, be in the synagogue of satan
Meditating on the prophecies I'm revelating
You feel the threat of armageddon every riot in prison
Son of man was in the tombs, once dead and back risen
Red Hook militia who be holding down his garrison
You crown the sovereign, cause to god there's no comparison
You better load ya fucking caliber
Screw on ya fucking silencer, and check the year on ya calendar

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
High degrees of espionage is how my army treads
The use of spying, divine manipulation of the threads
Delilah knows Samson's strength lie in his dreads
Yo brother shine ya crown, don't let'em get inside ya head
Ghetto apostle doing god's work, the last supper host
And ye shall take of the blood
And strike the side and upper post
The whores of babylon got plagues between their legs
Hellfire in the womb, a fetal tomb, contaminated eggs
Abortion is the plague amongst the firstborn, the blackmales
Spare the females, heroin fell just like the plague of hail
Instruments of war echo throughout the projects
Souls drown in the red sea of blood, for material objects
They who worshipped the beast and his mark, went to war and bled
They didn't have the seal of god up in their forehead
I'm laying my life on the altar, inspired by Jehovah
Feast on this unleavened bread, and death shall pass you over

[Hook] - repeat 2X[Couplet 1 –Ali]
Je vois le désert avancer vers la verdure
Des larmes de lave coulent de la terre, ici-bas rien ne perdure
Déployer les ailes, l’esprit peut traverser le ciel
Démentiel, quand les fils d’Adam oublient l’essentiel
Deviennent virtuoses dans le virtuel, matérialistes, rituel
Veulent le respect sans qu'il soit soit mutuel
Habtiés par les démons quand le mal est habituel
La terre porte en elle le conflit comme Rebecca fille de Béthuel
Bakkah, Mecca, Baytou Allahi la direction universelle
Crois sa description telle quelle, dans le Coran 3-96
Dans le psaume 84 verset 5 et 6
Plus j’apprends plus j’en tire le bénéfice
L’ignorance nourrit haine et vice
Les mauvais nous voudraient sous les verrous
Vérité, paix et justice de Palestine au Pérou
Rap de la résistance comme Ghandi et Nehru
Nés sous le même soleil ici-bas rien de nouveau
Partout la terre crie d’Haïti à Soumatra
La tragédie nous rappelle que belle et précieuse est la vie
Insh’Allah  pour elle jusqu’au bout on se battra
La tragédie nous rappelle que belle et précieuse est la vie
Insh’Allah  pour elle jusqu’au bout on se battra

[Pont 1 – Ali]
Déployer les ailes, l’esprit peut traverser le ciel
Démentiel, quand les fils d’Adam oublient l’essentiel
La terre pleure comme un rappel (X2)

[Refrain – Ali] (X2)
Déployer les ailes, l’esprit peut traverser le ciel
Démentiel, quand les fils d’Adam oublient l’essentiel
La terre pleure comme un rappel (X2)

[Pont 2 –  Shabazz The Disciple]
Death be the penalty the way he just ascend
God crush it the Earth shell, rise once again
Remember me [?] pages of men
God crush it the Earth shell, rise once again

[Couplet 2 - Shabazz The Disciple]
Back and risen from the ashes, the blood and the bullets
Never cross you, ain't afraid to die with the heart to pull it
A real nigga from the streets, you ain't afraid to spill it
The one who figured out his purpose, ain't afraid to fulfill it
So many nights I made my whole Earth cry
When I wasn't in my room and she heard slugs fly
Cause any day could be that day Allah could close your eyes
Where they put you in that box with that suit and that tie
Covered in roses cause my peeps are under hypnosis
[?] Moses, brimstone for my opposers
So many nights I heard the whole Earth cry
[?] soul touched the sky
Shabazz The Disciple and the trick is
Press up the pulses and stickers

[Refrain – Ali] (X2)

[Pont 2 –  Shabazz The Disciple][Verse 1]
Uses to stalk like a hawk pon the sidewalk looking for my prey
Sometimes I hit the subway, schemin to catch a jackpot
Shit is hot too many cops, I think I'll run up in a crack spot
I start on my mission and yo I'm scrambling
Approach a group of shorties who were gambling
I play it off and ask one of them a question
Yo shorty I'm lost, yo help me out with some directions
He stated kicking it and something kept shining
I looked at his hand it was a ring full of diamonds
Evil was my level of thinking
Get all I can get and leave my victims dead and stinking
I drew the guns from the holsters on my sides
This is a stickup, don't make it a fucking homicide
Give me the cash quick fast or my nine'll blast
They gave it up and did the 100 yard dash
I left shorty on the ground face down
Shitting and pissing and under pressure from the 3 pound
I cold stripped his ass, pistol whipped his ass
Robbed him blind and left his head all gashed

Committing armed robberies, we be committing armed robberies
Committing armed robberies
Trying our best to live phat - fuck poverty!!!!!!

[Hook: Killah Priest]
The shootouts over dice
The sirens and the lights
The late night heist
The thieves in da nite

[Verse 2]
Continued on my mission, I went to the corner to the phone booth
And called preme and the troops
I told preme the plan and what to carry
Cause where we going tonight yo it's kinda scary
I told him bring grenades and extra drivers
To pull this shit off right, we can't leave survivors
We reached the scene of the crime got on the job
Dressed to rob was the motherfucking mad mob
We left the driver with the engine running
Ran up in the building, on our way to make a killing
Reached the floor, I rang the bell on the door
Cocked the .44 ready to bring them brothers war
I rang the bell once more a brother opened the door
Bup! bup!, we put his brains on the floor
We ran up in the spot letting off mad shots, until the last brother dropped
And when he dropped, I realized it was Klein
I said to myself, yeah this nigga ass is mine
Slapped him with the magnum, knocked him out dragged him
Tied him to a motherfucking chair and I gagged him
Torture motherfuckers, preme you know how we do
Cut off all his fingers and then drugged him with a needle
When he recuperated then he cooperated
He started singing where his drugs were being operated
Buck to the chest, bang to the head
Preme shot him in the ear to make sure he's dead
The next thing on my mind yo it was leaving
But first I gotta make sure no one else is breathing
We dragged Klein down the fire escape
Stripped him of his gun, then we grabbed the safe
With help from Supreme and my cousin Pumpster
We bagged him in a body bag and dumped him in a dumpster
Left his ass in the garbage all smothered
Threw a grenade in the window and ran for cover
We saw a witness on our way out the gutter
My little cousin pump slit his throat with a box cutter
While he was laying there gagging, I put the tool to his head
And blew that shit up with lead
Emptied the clip in my nine out
Jumped in the bema with the safe, then we headed to the hideout
I was thinking bout that fucking catastrophe
We left at least 10 or more casualties
Splattered around but naked
The only means of identity was their motherfucking dental records

Committing armed robberies, we be committing armed robberies
Committing armed robberies
Trying our best to live phat - fuck poverty!!!!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Dap]
Yo I walk down the block, gun shots follow the block
Mom dukes is a maid, I think this shit is a raid - check it out
I'm living this low-budget violent lifetime
Watch me break it down, start to kill these rhymes
Lifting pockets was a sport just to get respect
Little nigga little brother watch shorty with the tec
Snatching weight across the land to kill the wicked man
No one could hold me down, no one can even stop me
Weight taped to my leg ready to see poppi
Walking through the doors and I'm scared to death
Trigger finger's on my right incase they tried to flex
Seeing weight, cream and dream niggas they start to skeem
What's life after this, should we break shit down
Let these brothers know around town that we do get down
East New York style, hold me back one time
Busting shots in the air, cause the world was mines
Check it out...

Committing armed robberies, we be committing armed robberies
Committing armed robberies
Trying our best to live phat - fuck poverty!!!!!!

[Hook] - 2XWhat up Skizz?

[Verse 1: Lil' Fame]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died you probably vision me shot up
And laying on the stretcher
Cause I ain't the nigga that die from high blood pressure
My demise in the midst of a crime go fresher
Look at his eyes he's ready to die, Lord bless him
It is what it’s gonna be, ain't much that worry me
Can’t care whether is 20 of us or one of me
Gun boys ride with us, niggas still get yapped
Pistol whiped on all monitors, you know what time it is
Low nigga run up, squeeze a couple shots in your shirt
Touch your best out to see if it work (Brang! Brang!)
My niggas get high, get drunk, go ape
Whoop you out for about 20 minutes straight then we rotate
Straight put the beats on em, no brakes
Since way back in the days, nigga's name hold weight
And we still active, still mashin'
Still inspiring, still shining, still firing

[Hook: Lil' Fame]
Violence is a universal language
Nah nigga you done pick the wrong nigga to bang with
(Brang-brang!) We murder ya
BK nigga get down, the dirtiest, we bang
We give 'em the whole thang!

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died
You probably picture a hollow bursting out of a nine
And splattered me when it popped, jerked me out of my prime
My fam'll be mad of God, cursing out of the sky
If violence begets violence and death rules everything around me
Dreams are really nightmares, in King’s County
And even though my daughter was born here
Slaughter and war go on here
You'll get your fucking wig blown off here
Let's put the mirror to the violence, an electrify spirit
That defines visionary riots, military science, dignitary silence
Ambassadors are assassinated
From the war-room to the block assassinations are created
Murders are premeditated and orchestrated by a symphony conductor
Sort of when sawed-offs are spraying
The rhythm of the gun shots is like a song is playing
Speaking in the same tongue to God like to talk to Satan

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shabazz The Disciple]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died
You’d probably picture me slumped over the wheel in my ride
Drugs planted in the trunk, being accused of a crime
Orchestrated by COINTELPRO the FBI
? all on the dashboard, cause my spirits to fly
Wanna see me scalpel ride?? filled with formaldehyde
Police the modern day romans, stolen profits with nines
Like the prophets in black, leaders of what they prophesized
Hood Christ crucified, two G’s on my side
My peter’s heater a sly, cause my Judas demise
I pray I look my angel of death right in his eyes
You coming with me motherfucker, finish this beef in the sky
These last earth memories, the sight was frightening
Hear thunder when the hood Christ, striked the lightning
Ain’t no fuckin hail Mary’s, is hail of slugs
Brain dead on your deathbed, family pull the plug

[Hook][Intro: Hell Razah]
T.H.U.G. Angelz
A Brooklyn tale, you know?
This goes out to all the families out there
Lost somebody to the drug game
Half of the hood fell victim to crack and AIDS, man
We had to follow? The father was a cokehead

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Cap daddy was a whore martyr, seduced one of the street walkers
Spoiled her with material things, a street talker
Old school, one ninety jewels and British Walkers
A ghetto prince, hood corporate project, apartment office
Had her laying up in luxury suites, bragging and sniffing
They had two kids, both babies born with addiction
Connect brought 'em in on a big investment
Had tears of that brown shit, that direct from the gold depression
Plague of addiction, increase profit, margin of sales
China white, took it in scales
For six months, the feds was filming his deals
For direct sales, he was hell without a bail
Padlock the condo, in the Honda, kick the door off the hinges
All the distress, and wifey sharing syrenges
Now she got them dilated pupils and the glossy iris
He got natural life, he got trapped with the virus
And had son be in the White House, nodding off the bundles he clipped
Burning the spoon he had an elephant fists
With shooting galleries, they found him O.D.'d in the alley
All of the wagers of his sins were tallied
They got hauled off in the black Caddy wagon
The heroine hurricane had them both chasing the dragon
She buy they worldly riches, they were consumed
Now pops gotta try to raise his daughter from the visiting room
He had a vision, of walking streets paved with gold
For that bank roll, he gave his soul
In the end all he had to show for it was life with no parole
As the BK Tale unfolds, cuz it's the power of the streets

[Interlude: Hell Razah]
She had to watch her brother on dope
She couldn't believe what he was doing in the bathroom
He told her don't worry about it
And then he died on her

[Hell Razah]
She was born on heroine, since a baby within
Minnie Riperton records would spin
She fell in love with the older men, the money they spent
By the time she was ten, starting using the gin
Been seduced by a pimp who was never her friend
One ride on it's white horse, it's in the syrenge
And you would never ever have no more worries again
He tapped her arm for the vein then he pinched her skin
She blacked out, woke up, in the back of a crackhouse
A down south runaway slave, was under the age
Her mother and her brother both turned in they grave
Wrote letters to her father who was up in the cage
He was sentenced to life til the end of his days
But the page kept turning, end in nothing but pain
And the more he kept reading, he was feeling ashamed
How the money and the fame just drove 'em insane
But he left down a legacy over some Hennessey
Now his daughter's on ecstasy, end of her pregnancy
She was raised as a sinner, and death is the penalty
So he told her, he promised to seek some therapy
Cuz it's the power of the streets

[Outro: Hell Razah]
They got him in the prison
He can't get out though
And the Brooklyn Tale continue[sample]
You didn't have any guard downstairs?
You didn't have a look out? Huh?
	Fifteen years, we never been hit, we changed apartments
	We never used that one before, we thought we were okay
You thought, well your ass must have been thinking
Because now we're out 300,000 dollars, do you hear me good?
Do you hear me good? We're out 300,000 dollars
Now what do we do? Huh?

[Intro: Shabazz The Disciple]
Armed Robbery

[Supreme repeating this throughout the whole song]
Dirty ones, flamers, bastards, robbers

[Shabazz the Disciple]
I stalk like a hawk on the sidewalk
Lookin for my prey, sometimes I hit the subway
Schemin to catch a jackpot
Shit is hot, too many cops, I think I'll run up in the crack spot
I started learnin shit, no I'm scramblin
Approach a group of shorties who were gamblin
I play it off and ask one of them a question
"Yo shorty, I'm lost, yo help me out with some protection"
We started kickin, and somethin kept shinin
I looked at his hand, it was a ring full of diamonds
Evil is my level of thinkin
Get all I could get and leave niggas dead and stinkin
I drew my guns from a hoister on my side
This is a stickup, don't make it a fuckin homicide
Give me the gats, quick fast, so my nine will blast
And gave it up and did a hundred yard dash
I had shorty on the ground, face down
Shittin and pissin, another pressure from the 3 pound
I cold stripped his ass, pistol whipped his ass
Robbed him blind, left his ass all gashed

[Chorus: Shabazz the Disciple]
Committin Armed Robberies
Committin Armed Robberies
Committin Armed Robberies
Tryin to best, but the fat fuck poverty

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Continued on my mission, I went to the corner
To the phone booth and called 'Preme and the troops
I told 'Preme to plan it with a carry
Cuz we're we goin tonight, yo it's kinda scary
I told him bring grenades and extra drivers
To pull this shit off right, we can't leave survivors
Reach the scene of the crime, got on the job
Dressed to rob was the muthafuckin Mad Mob
We left the driver wit the engine runnin
Ran up in the buildin, on our way to make a killin
Reach the floor, rang the bell on the door
Cop my four-four, ready to ring them niggas raw
I rang the bell once more, and nigga opened the door
Bla, bla, I put his brains on the floor
We ran up in the spot, lettin off mad shots
Until the last nigga dropped
And when he dropped, I realized it was crime
I said to myself, "Yeah, this nigga ass is mine"
Slapped him with the magnum, wrapped him up, dragged him
Tied him to a muthafuckin chair and I gagged him
Torture muthafuckas, we, you know how we do
Cut off all his fingers and dwelt him wit a needle
When he recuperated, then he cooperated
He started singin where his drugs were being operated
Buck to the chest, bang to the head
Bream shot up in the ear to make sure he's dead
The next thing on my mind, yo it was leavin
But first I gotta make sure no one else is breathin
We took climb down the fire escape
Stripped him of his mon', and we took the safe
Dealt from Supreme and my cousin Pumpster
We packed him in a body bag, dumped him a dumpster
Left his ass in the garbage, all smothered
Threw a grenade in the window, and ran for cover
We saw a witness on our way out the gutter
My little cousin Pumps slit his throat wit a box cutter
While he was layin and gaggin, I put a two to his head
And blew that shit up wit lead
And peep the click and my nine out
Jumped in the Beamo, wit the safe and we headed for the hideout
I was thinkin about that floatin catastrophe
We left at least 10 or more casualties
Splattered around, butt naked
The only means of identity is there muthafuckin dental records

[Chorus]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
So stay away from Armed Robbers
That's somethin ya don't know about
Use your brain before I blow it out
I'm leavin niggas in pieces, given 'em closed caskets
Even the fuckin priests
Stickin spots in churches, runnin around puttin devils in hearses
Livin in poverty bothers me
That's why I'm duckin 25, on homocidin on robberyIn progress...
