[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a [?], wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: Retch]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', it still got me goin'
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own shit and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Bryan
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm draggin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'?
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trainers cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds, [?] all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine [?] and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
[?] niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was [?]
You nervous like I thought you seen [?]
Got everybody thanking me
[?]
I'm a boss [?]
[?]
[?]
Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
[?]
Riding shotty in the chevy [?] know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk [?] like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado] x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to [?]
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meech]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
To get their shot, [?]
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real west side nigga, [?]
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
[?] put me high [?]
You can do that, flyin', fuck, do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on [?]
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga then drip of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the work she see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
[?] chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx [?] on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make shine sit on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell
Now I been rich since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your diction is lack, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo in another color
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My ? say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian [?]
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: SL Jones]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like [?] we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a [?]
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social [?]
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
And [?] sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
[?] what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em
Never write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the [?]
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
[?] with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on [?] tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz] x2
Need [?]? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
[?] I got it right here, I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
[?] we gettin' it
With that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a [?] to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off [?]
Rottweiler just to watch 'em
Maybachs for the profit
Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing
[?] the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne
And a 3 page spread
Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, go for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
[?] a monk, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be into me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A black claimed king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare try the Elohim of flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up trick
Put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, [?]
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
[?] check up, haters still [?]
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
[?] came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like [?]
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my [?]
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip
And just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit  with a pistol
[?] full of [?], I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID
Game leave me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some [?]
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
[?] throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blastin' naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Man didn't chief
My sons of sons'll sandwich the beef
We get loot, always scram from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this bitch, smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
[?]
Nah, fuck that
Bring them [?] back
[?]
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
[?] I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch[Eminem]
Woo! Shady, Aftermath (B-G-O-V)
Look at that bitch, shit! Hey!

There she goes, shakin that ass on the flo'
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole (yeah, yeah)
I think I'm losing control (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby CREEK!)

[Bobby Creekwater]
I bought a girl Patron, I get in the Henn' I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm long so she hearin me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone cause the DJ playin my song
Just another opportunity for sayin I'm known
I'm from Atlanta, so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin everything from white cran to deuce-deuce
With nothin to gain but migraines and loose tooths
Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo

[Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'mma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party - turn the music up
Let's get it started - go 'head and shake your butt
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it, bout it
I'm lookin for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Now shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
C'mon girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
Aw girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
C'mon girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me

[Eminem] OBIE TRICE!

[Obie Trice]
One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Wood just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious full breast ready to touch
Who's that in the Coupe blew back with a blue new hat
Givin head while he poppin the clutch?
True that I had a few, Obie rollin with Bruce
And Nathaniel annually knockin the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang boo
It's Sha-dy; you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum when the night came to the matinee
Mathers, Nate, Obie - came to party
You better ask somebody

[Hook][Intro: Obie Trice]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady, Shady
OOOOOOOOOOOOO-MIIIIIIIIIX ("Cryyyy")
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a ho's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
From the same turf as you's, nigga, what nerve of you's nigga
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit, nigga
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's but a nigga is on board

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga
Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissing you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Than clapping down bangers meant, for entertainment, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
You copy?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady!
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Alchemist
[Eminem] It's The Re-Up[Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think, you're the top and king of the castle
You're about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radi-O
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe
The same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big ba big big bay ba baby

[Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(STAT QUO!)We're back!

[Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I recieve
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick"
I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin, where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady!

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(BOBBY CREEK!)We're back!

[Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin through the track
Nigga

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(CA$HIS!)

[Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

Eminem - SHAAADDYYY!!!(Ha! I Told You We Was Back!)[Akon] Shady, Konvict, Upfront

[Hook: Akon]
I feel you creeping I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Shorty if you wanna ride you can ride on me
We can bump heads and collide on me
Want beef, damn right can rely on me
To bring that Campbell like Naomi
Just pull that girl and take it on easy
Looking all oiled up and all greasy
Bout that time you stop that teasing
Way that you drop done got me here cheesing
What's funny is that you taking
All my money for real
I'd rather spend it on you
Right now than my homie's bail
And I can see that's what you're made for
And ain't ever been no lame ho
With that booty bought and paid for
Won't move till you on my payroll!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah, Stat Quo! Ahhh!
I love when you do it girl move to it like you're used to it
Drop it down I want to put my thang through it
To the crib we go, go fast and slow
Make it twirl like a stripper slide down my pole
Shorty ass so swole got your boy like whoa
One night with me now she wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no, let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through and tap that hole
Make you lose control and all her girls know
That I hit it right at night, I'm a pro
I only come 'round and get sexual
If she flexible and bisexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if, only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that, murk that, work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine
Stat Quo, YEAH!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yeah, it's Bobby Creek, know'msayin?
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave I can see right through her
So we, dipped out, burn one trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body 8 like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care, listen baby it's a fact that
If you drop back I'mma quarterback sack that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at?

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Intro]
Hello? What up? Hello? Yo I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back...

[Verse: Eminem]
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do you can say good night and bye-bye to them my tunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
(Ay yo yo hold up! Hold up! Bring that back to the top man!)
(Marshall Mathers!)[Intro]
You will be a weapon
A minister of death praying for war
Because I am hard you will not fight me
But the more you hate me the more you will learn (yeah)
I am hard but I am Fair

[Verse 1]
Try this on for size:
Grow up broke
Stand in the cold with a hole in your coat
Stay next door to a woman who smokes
A whole pack of cigarettes with a hole in her throat
My mama's in the church, high off hope
My uncle's in the trap, my aunt don't know
My cousin went to school so she could be a writer
Met a nigga with some money and thats all she wrote
And here I am, runnin' these streets
Trying to find a bit of my identity
Meanwhile everyother nigga I knows getting money
Ridin' in the droptop like Kennedy
Fuckin' with all the young girls I like
I could be a hater but it ain't my right
I could could go fuck with the big booty girl, but
The whole hood hit her and she ain't my type
I came from the bottom, like it or not
They'll put a gun to you if they like what you've got
And they might break, but they don't bend
And they don't talk, because thats not the trend
But thats not news, so y'all won't know
It ain't yall's boat, so yall won't row
You gotta pay attention to be up on this
And why would yall pay what yall don't owe?
And why would yall ever give a fuck about me?
And why would I ever give a fuck about yall?
Theres no need to smell, I know I'm the shit
And where I come from, nigga, shit dont stall
And where I come from you can rob, rob rob
Talk shit all day, nigga that don't harm me
You're gonna stop who? You and what army?

[Intermission]
See, thing is you only have to fuck up once
Be a little slow, be a little late
Just once
And how you Ain't never be slow, never be late?
You can't plan for no shit like this man
This is life

[Verse 2]
Came up broke, the game was fixed;
How are you gonna win if you dont play?
They say be humble and all that shit, but
How are you gonna be the man if you dont say?
I shall not stop, or reconsider
Call in favors, I don't waiver
And even though I bring your hunger to a halt with food for thought
Nigga I don't cater
I don't talk just cause I can
I don't let a nigga disrupt my plan;
I don't let a nigga disrupt my paper -
Im gonna get money 'till I meet my makers
Talk my shit kick back on Acers
Walk away in the end with all that money like Idris and Paul at the end of takers

[Outro]
Who's the judge?
Judge is god
And why is he god?
Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent
And who is you opponent?
He doesn't exist
And why doesn't he exist?
Because he's a mere dissenting voice to the truth I speak
That's right
I speak the truth[Intro: Bobby Creekwater]
Yesssss, ladies and gentlemen (yeah man)
Bobby Creekwater, today's host
Today's narrator, yeah
(We do this shit every year around this time)
Today's what-the-fuck-ever you wanna call it
But I need y'all to sit back, and listen
Listen man (fuck what you write man, just go get 'em)

[Verse One]
An executive mindframe, fuck tryin to rap
Niggas represent a corner, I refined the map
Artesian water, this is flow untapped
And rep for 'em like Mike on playoff night; that's if the payoff right
The dream team, Bobby Creek, Em, 50 and them
We run the city like Diddy and them
The opposition we just pityin them, it's no chance
Put you niggas in the special olympics is no dance
I'm nice like a meal twice, nigga no grams
Get them bitches out they pants, I did it with no hands!
See, one thing's for sure I'm pure uncut
Baby you can either stay down or get gunned up
Mr. Night Life, I can give you niggas sun up
I just get an order, let my niggas pick the gun up
That's one up on ya, nigga wake yo' punk ass up
This is ammonia, fuck your face up
Bitches won't even telephone ya
I can space age pimpin, a pocket full of stone ya
Ya dig? Take the world over that's the gig
Sell enough units have Paul and Jimmy dancin the jig
Roll the Maserati through the city, me and Riggs
Bumpin Obie Trice, shoot a bird at the pigs
Ever since a nigga got rich
Life is still a bitch but she a high class bitch
I just wanna fuck with me a high class bitch
Nigga pitch that on some eyeglass shit
See I classic, enough to get the mics back right
And I'm a fan of record sales, I don't like that hype
I'm here to end it

[Hook]
Oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he?
Yea, goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he?
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
There he is - goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he?
Yea, oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he?
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
Bobby Creek, Bobby Creek...

[Verse Two]
Yea, yeah
Nice like Mike right, you niggas soft as night lights
Diamond's a tall order I'm just tryin to get the hype right
I'm throwed off, so hard, so soft, sold out
Bought the Coupe a color of nice weather and rolled out
I can't hold out, hot like a fish fried
Who the fuck is this guy? The ruler on the disc I
Hit you in your suit coolers, I'm in the Coupe cooler
Than pigskin men base runners and hoop shooters
A loose screw ban money like The Legendary Roots Crew
This is just the shit that I am used to
Oh nah, I don't bust a chopper but I used to
Now I put the word out - I'm sure you niggas heard 'bout
Young boss sold money, old school new paint
Ball knowin you can't, give a fuck what you think
Member of the mighty Shady Records, nigga you ain't
Think you fuckin with me then double whatever you drink
You can't fathom what the bitch throwin at him
Couple niggas hatin on him but the fans waitin on him
Like a, PlayStation 3, money for your advance
My vacation fee, ain't no use in hatin me nigga
And don't shit-talk pimp, I'd rather flush
Anyone with big enough nuts to come and fuck with us
I bust but keep in mind, pressure bust pipes
And you niggas wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
What the fuck? (yeah)

[Hook][Hook:]
I did it for the ones that never had
The players that never will
Ride old schools ingrained in
Wheels of Steel
I know about the slums and hard times
Boats and sewers lines
Cops that kick doors in
Black eye shines
This more than rhymes
I do it for the ones

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I ain't the one for politicin'
Just liquor bottle sippin'
One the corners with my partners talkin' life after death
And the meaning of empty boxes that sit on my shelf
Too real to beg for meals, too proud to ask for help
I know we pray, we sell weed, married for life
To this game we in my friend passed the rice
Lets get it, more than we got it
Fillin' my pockets
With petty dreams, of being king of parking lot and
My homie lobby until they shot him
Polo down blood spotted, so why bother
Being fresh, when you ain't fly enough for death
I don't do this for my health
But for those that ain't here

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Bobby Creekwater]
I do it for those with less fortune
They ain't got a lot but yet they still bless they portion
My mic got distortion but I talk this shit regardless
Thankful for my oddness in the neighborhood that birthed me
But then I talk that shit that make the government research me
Yea, I do my best, Pimp is gone, Bun here, after death I do the rest
How do me, and hopefully, they may say easy to do you
Know you feel like its in vain sometimes, nigga, we do too
We boohoo
Then we laugh, then we get up off our ass
Quietly acquire fortune so we yellin' free at last
We are so much more than any condo we ever closed
Can we keep if we get it, shit we never know

[Hook:][Intro: Obie Trice]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady, Shady
OOOOOOOOOOOOO-MIIIIIIIIIX ("Cryyyy")
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a ho's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
From the same turf as you's, nigga, what nerve of you's nigga
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit, nigga
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's but a nigga is on board

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga
Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissing you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Than clapping down bangers meant, for entertainment, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
You copy?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady!

VERSE 1

Nuts over size cahones do it right now you can count money sooner

And material things that dont mean shit
We should all be ashamed in the grand scheme of it
Eat a dick in public, yup you gotta love it

Oh...by the way my name is [B-B-B-Bobby creek] and this is Stat..

{Stat Quo}
VERSE 4

Beverly Hills in a swimming pool I'm cool as Axel Foley

No playboy I dont hate scrimmage

Yeyy![Intro]
Excuse me?
Is it ok that I smoke in here?
It's- It's cool?
Thank You
(lights cigarette)
Ok here's the thing
I don't know what you guys did to provoke this man
But you did

[Verse]
I mean here's a guy all by his lonesome
Develops a plan so everybody can eat, everybody could be happy
You motherfuckers could make a lot of money and the gods where pleased
And you come along and get greedy
Not only where you greedy but you wanted to cut this guy out of the plan that he developed!
I don't know what type of shit that is but you know, I mean you guys know better
At least you think you did
Now you motherfuckers come to me for information
Your in the weakest state
You're running around like chickens who got their heads chopped off
And this guy, this fuckin guy man
Now this guy wants revenge

[Outro]
I don't know who you are
I don't know what you want
But what I do have are a very particular set of skills;
Skills I have acquired over a very long career
Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you
I will find you, and I will kill you[Eminem]
Woo! Shady, Aftermath (B-G-O-V)
Look at that bitch, shit! Hey!

There she goes, shakin that ass on the flo'
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole (yeah, yeah)
I think I'm losing control (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby CREEK!)

[Bobby Creekwater]
I bought a girl Patron, I get in the Henn' I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm long so she hearin me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone cause the DJ playin my song
Just another opportunity for sayin I'm known
I'm from Atlanta, so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin everything from white cran to deuce-deuce
With nothin to gain but migraines and loose tooths
Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo

[Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'mma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party - turn the music up
Let's get it started - go 'head and shake your butt
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it, bout it
I'm lookin for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Now shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
C'mon girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
Aw girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
C'mon girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me

[Eminem] OBIE TRICE!

[Obie Trice]
One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Wood just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious full breast ready to touch
Who's that in the Coupe blew back with a blue new hat
Givin head while he poppin the clutch?
True that I had a few, Obie rollin with Bruce
And Nathaniel annually knockin the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang boo
It's Sha-dy; you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum when the night came to the matinee
Mathers, Nate, Obie - came to party
You better ask somebody

[Hook][Akon] Shady, Konvict, Upfront

[Hook: Akon]
I feel you creeping I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Shorty if you wanna ride you can ride on me
We can bump heads and collide on me
Want beef, damn right can rely on me
To bring that Campbell like Naomi
Just pull that girl and take it on easy
Looking all oiled up and all greasy
Bout that time you stop that teasing
Way that you drop done got me here cheesing
What's funny is that you taking
All my money for real
I'd rather spend it on you
Right now than my homie's bail
And I can see that's what you're made for
And ain't ever been no lame ho
With that booty bought and paid for
Won't move till you on my payroll!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah, Stat Quo! Ahhh!
I love when you do it girl move to it like you're used to it
Drop it down I want to put my thang through it
To the crib we go, go fast and slow
Make it twirl like a stripper slide down my pole
Shorty ass so swole got your boy like whoa
One night with me now she wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no, let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through and tap that hole
Make you lose control and all her girls know
That I hit it right at night, I'm a pro
I only come 'round and get sexual
If she flexible and bisexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if, only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that, murk that, work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine
Stat Quo, YEAH!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yeah, it's Bobby Creek, know'msayin?
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave I can see right through her
So we, dipped out, burn one trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body 8 like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care, listen baby it's a fact that
If you drop back I'mma quarterback sack that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at?

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Intro]
Hello? What up? Hello? Yo I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back...

[Verse: Eminem]
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do you can say good night and bye-bye to them my tunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
(Ay yo yo hold up! Hold up! Bring that back to the top man!)
(Marshall Mathers!)[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a [?], wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: Retch]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', it still got me goin'
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own shit and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Bryan
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm draggin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'?
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trainers cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds, [?] all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine [?] and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
[?] niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was [?]
You nervous like I thought you seen [?]
Got everybody thanking me
[?]
I'm a boss [?]
[?]
[?]
Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
[?]
Riding shotty in the chevy [?] know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk [?] like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado] x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to [?]
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meech]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
To get their shot, [?]
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real west side nigga, [?]
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
[?] put me high [?]
You can do that, flyin', fuck, do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on [?]
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga then drip of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the work she see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
[?] chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx [?] on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make shine sit on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell
Now I been rich since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your diction is lack, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo in another color
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My ? say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian [?]
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: SL Jones]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like [?] we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a [?]
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social [?]
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
And [?] sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
[?] what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em
Never write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the [?]
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
[?] with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on [?] tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz] x2
Need [?]? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
[?] I got it right here, I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
[?] we gettin' it
With that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a [?] to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off [?]
Rottweiler just to watch 'em
Maybachs for the profit
Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing
[?] the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne
And a 3 page spread
Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, go for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
[?] a monk, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be into me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A black claimed king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare try the Elohim of flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up trick
Put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, [?]
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
[?] check up, haters still [?]
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
[?] came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like [?]
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my [?]
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip
And just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit  with a pistol
[?] full of [?], I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID
Game leave me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some [?]
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
[?] throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blastin' naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Man didn't chief
My sons of sons'll sandwich the beef
We get loot, always scram from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this bitch, smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
[?]
Nah, fuck that
Bring them [?] back
[?]
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
[?] I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch[Intro: Bobby Creekwater]
Yesssss, ladies and gentlemen (yeah man)
Bobby Creekwater, today's host
Today's narrator, yeah
(We do this shit every year around this time)
Today's what-the-fuck-ever you wanna call it
But I need y'all to sit back, and listen
Listen man (fuck what you write man, just go get 'em)

[Verse One]
An executive mindframe, fuck tryin to rap
Niggas represent a corner, I refined the map
Artesian water, this is flow untapped
And rep for 'em like Mike on playoff night; that's if the payoff right
The dream team, Bobby Creek, Em, 50 and them
We run the city like Diddy and them
The opposition we just pityin them, it's no chance
Put you niggas in the special olympics is no dance
I'm nice like a meal twice, nigga no grams
Get them bitches out they pants, I did it with no hands!
See, one thing's for sure I'm pure uncut
Baby you can either stay down or get gunned up
Mr. Night Life, I can give you niggas sun up
I just get an order, let my niggas pick the gun up
That's one up on ya, nigga wake yo' punk ass up
This is ammonia, fuck your face up
Bitches won't even telephone ya
I can space age pimpin, a pocket full of stone ya
Ya dig? Take the world over that's the gig
Sell enough units have Paul and Jimmy dancin the jig
Roll the Maserati through the city, me and Riggs
Bumpin Obie Trice, shoot a bird at the pigs
Ever since a nigga got rich
Life is still a bitch but she a high class bitch
I just wanna fuck with me a high class bitch
Nigga pitch that on some eyeglass shit
See I classic, enough to get the mics back right
And I'm a fan of record sales, I don't like that hype
I'm here to end it

[Hook]
Oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he?
Yea, goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he?
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
There he is - goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he?
Yea, oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he?
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
Bobby Creek, Bobby Creek...

[Verse Two]
Yea, yeah
Nice like Mike right, you niggas soft as night lights
Diamond's a tall order I'm just tryin to get the hype right
I'm throwed off, so hard, so soft, sold out
Bought the Coupe a color of nice weather and rolled out
I can't hold out, hot like a fish fried
Who the fuck is this guy? The ruler on the disc I
Hit you in your suit coolers, I'm in the Coupe cooler
Than pigskin men base runners and hoop shooters
A loose screw ban money like The Legendary Roots Crew
This is just the shit that I am used to
Oh nah, I don't bust a chopper but I used to
Now I put the word out - I'm sure you niggas heard 'bout
Young boss sold money, old school new paint
Ball knowin you can't, give a fuck what you think
Member of the mighty Shady Records, nigga you ain't
Think you fuckin with me then double whatever you drink
You can't fathom what the bitch throwin at him
Couple niggas hatin on him but the fans waitin on him
Like a, PlayStation 3, money for your advance
My vacation fee, ain't no use in hatin me nigga
And don't shit-talk pimp, I'd rather flush
Anyone with big enough nuts to come and fuck with us
I bust but keep in mind, pressure bust pipes
And you niggas wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
What the fuck? (yeah)

[Hook][Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think, you're the top and king of the castle
You're about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radi-O
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe
The same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big ba big big bay ba baby

[Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(STAT QUO!)We're back!

[Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I recieve
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick"
I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin, where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady!

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(BOBBY CREEK!)We're back!

[Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin through the track
Nigga

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(CA$HIS!)

[Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

Eminem - SHAAADDYYY!!!(Ha! I Told You We Was Back!)[Intro]

[Verse 1: Pretty Ken]
Since the early 90s we've been getting to the money
Back when they used to tell us that we talked funny
Used to make them records radio didn't want to play it
We would claim a (?) but y'all didn't want to say it
Back when we were country gold ropes and silk shirts
30s on them bones beat coming out the [?]
We was smoking chronic didn't know nothing bout no [?]
Back when we were rolling now-a-days they call it work
Way before them skinny jeans, way before the Coogi
We've been tryin' to get that money got to get that Gucci
Louie it was poppin' but you had to be the man
And if you was you better keep it to yourself you understand
So now they like you you so A Town with it
Cooler than a fan in your A Town fitted
And when they want to hear ya they say A Town spit it
Been over heavy since they let the A Town hit it

[Hook: Pretty Ken]
What Up? Now when you see me in your city
What up? And when we all in New York air like

What Up? What up?

What up? And when we chillin in DC it's
What up? An when you see us in Miami
What up? What up?

[Verse 2: BOBBY KREEKWATER]
I do it for my city, i do it for my people
It costs to be the boss so being you is so much [?]
I write R and B i don't mess with rap guys
It's Bobby Kreekwater every letter capitalized
And we don't punch the clock we laugh and slap fire
The rims on your car depend on your trap size
The money came here they act like rap died
But to me the city heavy so go and get baptized
They knowing real good, so i ain't got to show it
Your girl just be jocking but i act like i don't know it
Ay man I'm just a poet, rebel without a cause
An i don't know no _____ so i ain't got no (pause)
I really hate the law cause they always out of bounds
My city set the trend so we always out of town
If PK say I'm great i just gotta start saying it
Man we run the game they just gotta start playing it

[Hook]
What Up? Now when you see us off in Philly
What up? And when we chillin' down in eastern
What up? And when you see us in the shah
What Up? What up?
What up? And when we off in St, Louis
What up? And when we chillin' off in Vegas
What up? An when we in the Carolinas
What up? What up?

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]

What up? What up?[Intro]
You will be a weapon
A minister of death praying for war
Because I am hard you will not fight me
But the more you hate me the more you will learn (yeah)
I am hard but I am Fair

[Verse 1]
Try this on for size:
Grow up broke
Stand in the cold with a hole in your coat
Stay next door to a woman who smokes
A whole pack of cigarettes with a hole in her throat
My mama's in the church, high off hope
My uncle's in the trap, my aunt don't know
My cousin went to school so she could be a writer
Met a nigga with some money and thats all she wrote
And here I am, runnin' these streets
Trying to find a bit of my identity
Meanwhile everyother nigga I knows getting money
Ridin' in the droptop like Kennedy
Fuckin' with all the young girls I like
I could be a hater but it ain't my right
I could could go fuck with the big booty girl, but
The whole hood hit her and she ain't my type
I came from the bottom, like it or not
They'll put a gun to you if they like what you've got
And they might break, but they don't bend
And they don't talk, because thats not the trend
But thats not news, so y'all won't know
It ain't yall's boat, so yall won't row
You gotta pay attention to be up on this
And why would yall pay what yall don't owe?
And why would yall ever give a fuck about me?
And why would I ever give a fuck about yall?
Theres no need to smell, I know I'm the shit
And where I come from, nigga, shit dont stall
And where I come from you can rob, rob rob
Talk shit all day, nigga that don't harm me
You're gonna stop who? You and what army?

[Intermission]
See, thing is you only have to fuck up once
Be a little slow, be a little late
Just once
And how you Ain't never be slow, never be late?
You can't plan for no shit like this man
This is life

[Verse 2]
Came up broke, the game was fixed;
How are you gonna win if you dont play?
They say be humble and all that shit, but
How are you gonna be the man if you dont say?
I shall not stop, or reconsider
Call in favors, I don't waiver
And even though I bring your hunger to a halt with food for thought
Nigga I don't cater
I don't talk just cause I can
I don't let a nigga disrupt my plan;
I don't let a nigga disrupt my paper -
Im gonna get money 'till I meet my makers
Talk my shit kick back on Acers
Walk away in the end with all that money like Idris and Paul at the end of takers

[Outro]
Who's the judge?
Judge is god
And why is he god?
Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent
And who is you opponent?
He doesn't exist
And why doesn't he exist?
Because he's a mere dissenting voice to the truth I speak
That's right
I speak the truthWorking on it(Intro)

(Bobby Creekwater)
The Soft Leather In The Cope Got Me Going Hard
Her Soft Lips And The Brain Got Me Growing Smart
Oh Lord I'm So Caught Up In This Life Style
Cold Hearted Every Now And Then I Might Smile
Spend A Day In My Shoes, And Walk A Light Mile

My Style So Similar To Yero, A Surgeon With The Word Play Nero

(Chorus)

Please Don't Be A Hero, We Shut Shit Down
And We Want It All, Not Now But Right Now
Blow The Safe, Put The Money In The Bag
Not Enough Room Wit A Drag

(Cashis)
I'm Running In The Bank Like Buck, I Don't Give A Fuck
Flagged Down, Half Broke, Looking Like Nigga What
I'm The Phillie-up, Still Hittin Niggas Up
Foe-Fim Pull My Dump, See 50 What
Spit Blood, Piss Suds In Your Rental Truck
Lite A Blunt, Found A Pretty Little Bitch To Fuck
Hear Your Rap Songs, Thinking That You Really Suck
I'm A Bigger Boss, Bigger Dick, Really Nuts
Better Feel Me Russ, Nigga I Ain't Feeling Duck
I'ma Find Your Ass Down, Let Me Trigger Fuck
I'm In Your City Chump, You Ain't Owned By Anyone
And If I Smack A Bitch Nigga, Chump I'm Getting Bust

You Better Recognize A G When You Close To One
I'm Real Life Gang Type, With The Focus Spun
You In My Sights, I'ma Show You Who The Locus Cuz

(Chorus)
(Bobby Creekwater)
Please Don't Be A Hero, We Shut Shit Down

Not Enough Room Wit A Drag (You Know The Routine)

(Bobby Creekwater)
I'm Oh So Era, Get, Checked On This Rap
I Hear You Niggas, Rap Dre's Vent
But It Don't Matter None, We Elephants To An Ant

Any Hater Can't Get My Middle, Forlangie
I Guess The Question For Then You Niggas Is Can we
Well Yes We Can, Obama Me Man
You Probably Get Your Lanes Gone For Feed Man
Goons With Weapons in The Air, Like He Man
You Say Bobby In The Future, I Don't Agree Man
I Had Become Everything I Wanted To Be Man
They Call Me Creek, And Now A Days I Don't See Land
Down Underwater Like A Seaman
Ay Homie
If You Mention One You Mention All, Cause its We Man
And That's The Way Its Going To Motherfucking Be Man

(Chorus)
(Bobby Creekwater)
