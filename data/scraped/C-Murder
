[Verse 1: C-Murder]
Bitch, I'm down with No Limit, I'll ride for the cause
I'm the nigga on the tank with the big fucking balls
And if anybody fuck with Snoop Doggy-Dogg
I'mma make these niggas put his name on the wall
And everywhere I go, I got Mr. Magic here
Because I know that nigga don't care
He'll have that red shit pouring out your hair
Nigga, any-fucking-time, nigga, any-fucking-where
"Make 'em bleed" is the motto that I live by
If you fuck with me, it's a must, you die
Them niggas might go running, but them niggas can't hide
It's like shooting yourself, it's a suicide
KLC rock the beat, hitting hard like Burt
Niggas in the know-ya know him as "Big Hurt"
Just like Soulja Slim, he'll put you in the dirt
And have your picture on front of a t-shirt
And when I make moves, I got a hundred niggas with me
Just in case a nigga out there trying to get me
All my niggas is down to squeeze the trigger
That's why I'm down for my motherfucking niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Magic]
What you ain't heard, boy, I ride with these niggas
I die with these niggas
Did a drive by with my forty five cause I'm down with these niggas
Snoop Dogg and Bossalinie
Don't shoot; nah, nigga, just call me when you need me
Believe me, I never bite the hand that feed me
Just point them niggas out, and I'll leave 'em all on the street bleeding
Bitch, you fucking with a grown man
How I be done waxed you in your house
And then buried you on your own land
See, the cops is scared to come and get me
But I don't blame 'em cause they know I got a bunch of thug niggas with me
Looking for trouble, starting shit
I'm riding solo, and I'm busting and getting rid of your clique
See, you boys ain't about beefing
When you fucking with niggas that'll definitely get you â€“ eternal sleep
But if you didn't get the fucking picture (automatic gunfire)
Bitch, I'm down for my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
What niggas? Them niggas? Yeah, dawg, you with it?
Fuck 'em, let's get 'em, do 'em, I did 'em

I got my buddy in this motherfucker
Leave a nigga bloody in this motherfucker
We in the cutty, motherfucker
You done done too much; you got it coming, motherfucker
Some of these niggas is bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
Well, where I'm from, we like to ride on fours
Do it from the shoulders, or do it from the toes

C-Murder and Magic, hell yeah, them my motherfucking homies
So when shit get thick and foggy
And niggas wanna act like they wanna get with Snoop Doggy

You don't wanna mess with that Glock, boy

And speakin of drugs they wanna label me a killer
So don't push me life is hard
I'm trying to fill my own graveyard the 3rd Ward
I'm a menace to society like I'mma threat
Y'all ain't met the real C yet I'mma rep
Ask Bumby, Wayne and Rich about me it's realer than real
I was chokin' when Slim got killed, you know how I feels
It's a shame the reaper came who should I blame
Mytaius to me to be cool you know I'm a fool
Messing with you gorillaz will get your head bust
Me and my homies we about that paper
It's money we after, straight money makers
Cut boyz could never be no fakers
I spit that gangsta rap forget that hip-hop
I bought them gangster-ass beats that make your head bop
Then make that iron cock and then that show stops
Cause it's murda murda murda murda
The 187 cause I don't give a.. but they don't heard me though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.G.]
If you don't know me ask somebody you know and I bet they know
This lil nigga quick to draw down and split ya or cut ya throat
This lil nigga quick to handle his business and quick to creep
This lil nigga ain't bout coppin no play or squashin no beef
This lil nigga keep a 40 up on him wit an extension
This lil nigga will steal ya even when ya payin attention
I'mma uptown gangsta, V.L. gone
When I die bury me wit ya bo's and a t-shirt on
I'm a fool like that I be walkin' through the hood
With all my jewelry on, bitch niggas wonder how I do it
I'm real, that's how I could, it gets no realer
I got killas like jarnel just waitin for me to spend 'em
I was raised with gorillas and gangsters
Killers and thugs straight hustlers that'll touch you up
These choppers sendin niggas all true to the game
You hear C or B.G. and ya gotta know them names

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Neighborhood dope man, I mean real niggas

But nowadays I be too smart for the task
C-Murder been known to keep the rocks up in a Skittles bag
Waitin on a kilo they eight I'm straight you dig
What you need ten, ain't no fuckin order too big
And makin crack like this is the song
You won't be getting yo money if yo shit ain't cooked wrong
Overcook yo' dope it might come out brown
Them fiends gonna run yo ass clean outta town
But fuck that I'm bout to put my soldiers in the game
And tell ya how to make crack from cocaine

You gets the baking soda, I gots tha D
Get the triple beam and measure out yo dope
Mix one gram of soda for every seven grams of coke
And shake it up until it get harder
Then sit it on the stove in some ready made cold water
Twist the bitch like a knot while it's still hot
And watch that shit while it rock and rise to the fuckin top

Hella mail from sales
Hella ya-yo for scales
Come up short on my money I'm jumpin yo ass like bail

[Hook]

[Master P]
Nigga Nigga never let a nigga front you no dizos
Start from the ground, work yo way up to a kilo
Get some killers on yo team, keep one up in the chamber
For the jackas and the dope fiends
Fools comin up short, you better get rowdy
Kick down doors, show motherfuckers that ya bout it bout it
Break ki's down to oz's
Never buy any dope without weighin it on the triple beam
Fuck soda use B-12
Keep a stash for the droughts and take other niggas clientele
Check the mayonnaise jar for residue
Cause every fiend you miss want three or two
1. Never talk on the phone in ya house
2. Never slang dope out ya baby momma's house
3. Never fuck with snitches
Cause niggas that talk to the police is bitches
4. Keep a low key
And if you movin weight treat yo'self to an uzi
The first hit for free (damn)
But the next time you beep me
You betta have twenty G's
5. Never pay
Pimp hoes for the pussy
That's the 'Merican way
Clean up ya dirty money to good money
Cause legal money last longer than drug money

Fuckin' with me and my Mddl Fngz
But to this shit nigga we ain't strangers
Pull high-calibers and magnums

Hand grenades, and land mines
Chopper pipe bombs and missiles
Some of them bitches whistle

But all them bitches handle they business
All of them violent
Bout it bout it and dangerous
Soldiers that wanna gang with us

[Hook 2X]

[C-Murder]
Lay it down muthafucka
Everybody gotta go

For my lack of havin' papers
Fuck the law and the cops
Cuz I'm down for my gangsters

[Master P]
Some say we dangerous
Especially when broke
I'm mo daily than a dope fiend fiendin' for dope
I just live for confetti
You see I'm dangerous like Freddy
You see I run through your house and leave it messy like messy

[C-Murder]
I got too much stress in my head
I wanna take my own life
My last chance is a 211
But it got me thinkin' twice
It's a drought right now
So these drugs ain't happenin'
And if it wasn't for No Limit
There'd be no money in rapping

[Master P]
You see my boy had an apartment full of keyz and g'z
The word on the street is his homie told his baby momma to freeze!
You see you can't trust nobody in this dope game
Keep your eyez on your enemies
Stack some chips and get out man

[C-Murder]
Give me a ski-mask, a 9
I'll be a down ass nigga
And watch me pull a flea-flicker
And make my g's get bigger
If I get caught I'm gettin 25, but that don't mean shit
Cuz if I go to jail it's gotta be better than living like this
Nigga 2 shots in the air
Cuz I ain't bout bein' broke
And if you bout I make a move
Nigga, everybody gotta go
Just some bout it niggas from New Orleans
With tapes hooked up
C-Murder, Master P, and UGK
Now Nigga what?

[Hook till fade][C-Murder]
Wahhhhhh! (Told my niggas you was lookin' for me)
It's your boy C, from the CP3
Forever true 'til I'm dead (Do ya still love me?)
Lookin for it, Check this out, ya know

[Chorus: C-Murder]
I heard that you was lookin' for me, well here I go
I told my niggas you was lookin' for me, well there they go
It was once upon a time in the projects show
We bout this here, we keep the streets on lock yo

[C-Murder]
Felonious capers (Riders), Straight money makers
We jaggers, we bag 'em like the Green Bay Packers
24-7, all night, like 7-11
And when I die I don't know if I'll ever see heaven
Now I done seen sinners, sold coke to beginners
And blowed smoke with winners, now raise it up for them spinners
I'm on the block now, throw 'em up for your dog
I was born in the 3rd Ward, ruthless and hard
And cut through, like the CT committee
I ain't tryin to bounce, I'm tryin to flip a ounce and ball in my city
So player, get your shine on, get your shine on
All day long playboy, get your grind on
Now will you come to die tonight?
But it's my life or your life and I'm a fool with that knife
Straight from the cell blocks, behind the cell bars
It ain't easy being me - I'm a cutboy
Capone and 'Tez, that's my niggas ya dig
We be thuggin, we be wildin, in these villas ya dig
Cause we the realest ya dig, ain't no half steppin here
I'm caught up now, but next year is my year
2002 - C-Murder died, your leader came alive
2005 - he saved, now I'm back from the grave
Wildin out in the cellblocks is the project lil wodie
And I ain't  bothering nobody less you owe me

[Chorus] - 2X

[Montez]
I heard that you was lookin for me, well here I go
Posted up on the block with a block of that snow
Chillin wit Carnell off in the Nol
Run up and you'll get smoked, just to let you know that Montez ain't a ho
I'm from Atlanta where them haters get handled
We'll dismantle the handle, with gliss that curves to the front like bandanas
But for them small problems I keep revolvers
.38 snug nose, my problem solver
Knock a nigga, hit up off him
And toss him off in the ditch like the bitch that he is
If his partners try to find me, well they get the same shit
Cause I'm a motherfuckin fool with my hand on my tool
I knock a nigga out his shoes, that's how I pay my dues
And if you choose to oppose my crew
We'll bruise, your whole lil crew screamin out T-R-U
Cause we don't give a motherfuck, nigga
C told me that you lookin for me, here I go, wasup nigga?

[Chorus] - 2X
[Capone - background]
There they go
QB
Yo listen man, QB, CP3
Tru game baby

[Capone]
Yeah, I, I, I, I, I
I heard that they was lookin for me (Know I keep guns)
With hoods in the kitchen cookin for me (Teach you to spend one)
I got the call from the murder man (Wodie whats happ'nin?)
I got the drop, I could murder fam (It's nothin' to clap em)
Just give me the word, I'll send him a bird
To put 10 in him and finish him, it's business ya heard
See we flossin on another level, bossin on another level
Rose gold chain, rainbow rocks is the color bezel
Wodie, if they lookin I ain't hard to find
I stick out like a sore thumb with all this shine
I gotta killa mentaility with a ballers grind
I'll get you clipped long distance with a cordless nine
Send a kite to the Callio and every crack server
Who lettin that automatic blow, we freeing C-Murder - bitch!
(Spoken)
Yeah, this how we gon' do it baby
Boss recognize boss baby

[Chorus] - 2X[Hook-Lil Boosie]
When we came to the can, these niggas ran
This for the bitch-ass niggas, we blessed they open hands
But when we came to the can, these niggas ran
No holler, no letters, no cheddar, nah, nigga

[Verse 1-Lil Boosie]
When I came to the can, I saw it live and direct
What I seen with my eyes made me lose a lot of respect
For niggas I wrote checks, niggas I put clothes on
Niggas I gave a home, niggas I fronted heroin
Nigga can't even put [???] on a housephone
Shit, I had love for them niggas, now it's all gone
Nigga at the club with Rose by the cases
Stun the hoes like he chosen, this nigga made it
When he came down [???] situation I was the first one he called
But this nigga ducked my daughter in the mall
I should send a nigga to get that, but I'm gonna be cool
Cause if I cross ya and cutthroat ya, nigga, I'mma be you
You made the first mistake, nigga, when you forgot about misconduct
Second mistake, at court nigga, you wasn't even behind him
But I'm gon' kill you with kindness, what's happening nigga I'm out
Your VIP status is gone from the club to my house

[Hook]

[Verse 2-C-Murder]
Soon as that jury said "guilty,"
Everybody, they killed me
See this nigga on this hook, Lil Boosie? He feel me
I've got blood that say wanna see me rot in a box
I guess they feel them bullets gon' stop, but I think not
I feel like "Nah," they gonna be aiming for y'all
Cause y'all niggas ain't got C-Murder to call
I was a dog, [cussin?] and all, stole my Rolex and wrote checks
And God forgive me cause right now I wanna break this nigga neck
[???] and pushing more chickens
And my mission is to get revenge, [??] at my friends
They became my foes, man, I can't trust them hoes
I used to love my own brother, but I don't love him no more
Don't wanna hug him no more, cause this a limit fasho
That's why I tongue-kiss that tech 9, and fuck that .44
That's why I love Corey, Chelsea, Courtney and Shanelle
And if that ain't you, dog, you niggas can go to Hell[Master P]
Yo C-Murder
Nigga you woke?

There'd be no money in rapping

[Master P]
You see my boy had an apartment full of keyz and g'z
The word on the street is his homie told his baby momma to freeze!
You see you can't trust nobody in this dope game
Keep your eyez on your enemies
Stack some chips and get out man

[C-Murder]
Give me a ski-mask, a 9
I'll be a down ass nigga
And watch me pull a flea-flicker
And make my g's get bigger
If I get caught I'm gettin 25, but that don't mean shit
Cuz if I go to jail it's gotta be better than living like this
Nigga 2 shots in the air
Cuz I ain't bout bein' broke
And if you bout I make a move
Nigga, everybody gotta go
Just some bout it niggas from New Orleans
With tapes hooked up
C-Murder, Master P, and UGK
Now Nigga what?

[Hook till fade](*talking*)
Wake up-wake-up-wake up
Man I hit the set, and them boys be getting ghost
Ya know, they spooking but it's cool
I'm bout to wake 'em up

[Hook - 2x]
You better watch me, cause I'm doing bad
Plus I'm hurting, I gotta get weed
Now where them goods at, playboy give me that
And get them goods wrapped, I'll make you lean back

[C-Murder]
See my clock is on need fo', I'm 'ready tweeking
I can't be sitting up here hurting, all weekend
I keep on falling off, at the worst times
And if I'm stuck it ain't my fault, I'm gon reverse mines
My pain I'ma nourish mines, cause I'm sick with it
Now where them ballers at, I'm looking for that big ticket
Ten minutes from losing it, one day from locked up
The way I'm living, sooner or later I'm gon be boxed up
Nobody trusting me, they know how I'm coming
I hit the block, and I swear I see them cowards running
Putting they stash up, peeping out they windows
Now why they tripping, I'm the exact opposite of 5-0
It's called survival, of the fittest
I can't help it cause I'm with it, and you ain't with it
I come to get it, yeah I did it I did that
I can't take that back, so beat your feet back
All y'all gon remember me, cause me ain't no joke
Me do what me does, cause ain't no being broke
I was raised in this, I ain't ask for this
I tried changing my life, and now it's back to this
Somebody pray for me, the Lord is testing me
But them people, they gon have problems arresting me
Now my lungs hurting, need that black vest
And I feel like, jacking one of these rappers

[Hook - 2x]

[Fiend]
Was 14 with the felons, while y'all did the misdemeanors
Niggas my age, was pushing Beamers
Niggas that sprayed, while using Ninas
AK's and SK's, your chest cave
Your neck shaved, and your waves turn to still water
Hood on fire, racks of money steal daughters
Kill fathers, pop a seed in your mama
This routine, and you pussies thought you knew Fiend
I'm from a city, where ery'thing crooked
Where the right kind of money, meant the judge overlook it
And I'm screwed up, I ain't talking Swishahouse
'Fore I learned to tie my shoes up, I was burning crews up
My Ward verse your Ward, put them 22's up
These 26's, make you put them 22's up
This Mack-90 mean, I ain't giving you fuck
But bullets, in that shiny new truck
What you know about, fighting for five days
Hanging niggas upside down, coming at you sideways
A crooked H, going 67-5
And I add them three quarters for the ride, plus I'm high

[Hook - 2x]

[Popeye]
I got this world in the tip of my pistol, shining like crystal on my waist
Shadow ducking the barell, reflecting off in his face
He's below his lace, so my tape's no longer lead
Stomp in the Expedition, my mission was made to speed
Blazing up the weed, tried my tint's and armored lint
Checking up on my schedule, for all the Benz I spent
Get the hustling broad, put the one out of socket
Having enough to catch life, in all four of my pockets
You understand, and click your hand late
It's time to cope for what you never ate, guts and nuts on the dinner plate
Love is hate, kissing ass by wetting vocals
Hustling on the streets, when it's hotter than Akapolko

[Hook - 2x][Hook-Lil Boosie]
When we came to the can, these niggas ran
This for the bitch-ass niggas, we blessed they open hands
But when we came to the can, these niggas ran
No holler, no letters, no cheddar, nah, nigga

[Verse 1-Lil Boosie]
When I came to the can, I saw it live and direct
What I seen with my eyes made me lose a lot of respect
For niggas I wrote checks, niggas I put clothes on
Niggas I gave a home, niggas I fronted heroin
Nigga can't even put [???] on a housephone
Shit, I had love for them niggas, now it's all gone
Nigga at the club with Rose by the cases
Stun the hoes like he chosen, this nigga made it
When he came down [???] situation I was the first one he called
But this nigga ducked my daughter in the mall
I should send a nigga to get that, but I'm gonna be cool
Cause if I cross ya and cutthroat ya, nigga, I'mma be you
You made the first mistake, nigga, when you forgot about misconduct
Second mistake, at court nigga, you wasn't even behind him
But I'm gon' kill you with kindness, what's happening nigga I'm out
Your VIP status is gone from the club to my house

[Hook]

[Verse 2-C-Murder]
Soon as that jury said "guilty,"
Everybody, they killed me
See this nigga on this hook, Lil Boosie? He feel me
I've got blood that say wanna see me rot in a box
I guess they feel them bullets gon' stop, but I think not
I feel like "Nah," they gonna be aiming for y'all
Cause y'all niggas ain't got C-Murder to call
I was a dog, [cussin?] and all, stole my Rolex and wrote checks
And God forgive me cause right now I wanna break this nigga neck
[???] and pushing more chickens
And my mission is to get revenge, [??] at my friends
They became my foes, man, I can't trust them hoes
I used to love my own brother, but I don't love him no more
Don't wanna hug him no more, cause this a limit fasho
That's why I tongue-kiss that tech 9, and fuck that .44
That's why I love Corey, Chelsea, Courtney and Shanelle
And if that ain't you, dog, you niggas can go to HellArtist: Master P f/ C-Murder, Prime Suspects

[Verse 1: C-Murder]
Bitch, I'm down with No Limit, I'll ride for the cause
I'm the nigga on the tank with the big fucking balls
And if anybody fuck with Snoop Doggy-Dogg
I'mma make these niggas put his name on the wall
And everywhere I go, I got Mr. Magic here
Because I know that nigga don't care
He'll have that red shit pouring out your hair
Nigga, any-fucking-time, nigga, any-fucking-where
"Make 'em bleed" is the motto that I live by
If you fuck with me, it's a must, you die
Them niggas might go running, but them niggas can't hide
It's like shooting yourself, it's a suicide
KLC rock the beat, hitting hard like Burt
Niggas in the know-ya know him as "Big Hurt"
Just like Soulja Slim, he'll put you in the dirt
And have your picture on front of a t-shirt
And when I make moves, I got a hundred niggas with me
Just in case a nigga out there trying to get me
All my niggas is down to squeeze the trigger
That's why I'm down for my motherfucking niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Magic]
What you ain't heard, boy, I ride with these niggas
I die with these niggas
Did a drive by with my forty five cause I'm down with these niggas
Snoop Dogg and Bossalinie
Don't shoot; nah, nigga, just call me when you need me
Believe me, I never bite the hand that feed me
Just point them niggas out, and I'll leave 'em all on the street bleeding
Bitch, you fucking with a grown man
How I be done waxed you in your house
And then buried you on your own land
See, the cops is scared to come and get me
But I don't blame 'em cause they know I got a bunch of thug niggas with me
Looking for trouble, starting shit
I'm riding solo, and I'm busting and getting rid of your clique
See, you boys ain't about beefing
When you fucking with niggas that'll definitely get you â€“ eternal sleep
But if you didn't get the fucking picture (automatic gunfire)
Bitch, I'm down for my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
What niggas? Them niggas? Yeah, dawg, you with it?
Fuck 'em, let's get 'em, do 'em, I did 'em
We getting nutty in this motherfucker
I got my buddy in this motherfucker
Leave a nigga bloody in this motherfucker
We in the cutty, motherfucker
You done done too much; you got it coming, motherfucker
Some of these niggas is bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
Well, where I'm from, we like to ride on fours
Do it from the shoulders, or do it from the toes
I do my dirt all by my lonely
C-Murder and Magic, hell yeah, them my motherfucking homies
So when shit get thick and foggy
And niggas wanna act like they wanna get with Snoop Doggy
Lemme let you niggas know
Shit, fuck what you going through, and fuck what you stand for

[Hook][Intro]
You have a call from an inmate in a correctional facility
Inmate, state your name
Darren
This phone call may be monitered and recorded
Press three if you accept the charges, if not hang up

[Refrain: Ludacris]
To my cousin Darren Ranch, stay up homie
To my brother Chris Butler, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you
To my brother Mikey Mike, stay up homie
To my cuz J.B., stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
You lookin' at a man that would die for his daughter
Just to let her breathe, and I'd definitely die for Jesus cause he died for me
Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder just to see what he's seen
But then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther's dream
I'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it
But half of my black brothers are still incarcerated
Locked up in a cell block, lost from the shell shock
Some sold they soul, others used to sell rocks
Look up in my mailbox, I get letters from my cuz
And every week said he wanna hit the streets
But he never struck a deal cause his mouth will never squeal
Put some money on his books and help him out with his appeal
Send some pictures of the fam and nasty pics of Shawnna
If you ever have to leave I got your mother and your daughter
Born in this way of livin and our youth is stuck
To be safe it's safe to say the justice system's fucked up

[Refrain]
If you doin 25 to life, stay up homie
I got your money on ice so, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you
All my peoples in the pit, stay up homie
And until you hit the bricks, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Until I went to jail you couldn't tell me I ain't seen it all
That box, a motherfucker - it could stress a nigga balls
Especially when you broke and home base ain't acceptin' your calls
And you don't hear your name when it's mail time
Goddamn jailhouse barbers pushin' back on your hairline
Fuckin' Sinequan'll have you stuck in that pill-line
Your bitch miss the V-I this weekend
The food in your locker keeps shrinkin', your celly feet stinkin'
The canteen ran out of menthols
Can't see how grown men wash other men drawers
Niggas play the phone room reckless and get hit with new indictments
Talkin' about old connects and new prices
Stress'll take a young nigga, give him an old face
Or stress'll take a dumb nigga, give him a new case
That shit I used to tell my walkie, Lil' Itchy
All he did was smoke weed and drink coffee, I know he miss me

[Refrain: Beanie Sigel and Ludacris]
To my man Lil' Nell, stay up homie
To my man Steve P, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you
To my man Paul Selene, stay up homie
To Abdul McKeith, stay up homie
Until I see you in the streets keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Uhh, if your people locked up you need to send 'em some shit
Cause it's never too late to stop bein' a bitch
A magazine and some pictures is a nigga's whole world
When I was down them niggas fell off so I'm ridin' with the girls
Cause they got mo' heart, than them fake ass dudes
Ain't send no letters, no books, and no money for no food
Cause commissary is so very necessary
It's so close to bein slavery, in Texas nigga it's scary
I reached out to C-Murder right before I came home
And when him home, let me go I make sure that his books was on
And three months later that nigga came home too
Ain't No Limit to this shit cause now his dream's comin' Tru
I'ma keep ridin with Bun cause UGK will never stop
And I'mma stand up for my partner, steady let them off a lot
Biatch, and I'm as trill as you can be
They scream "Free Pimp C" but not see the pimp free

[Ludacris] C-Murder!

[Verse 4: C-Murder]
Wake up, roll call, another day gone by
Now put a 'X' on November 25
I'm still alive, oopen the dead roll balls
Now this dead man walkin', parkin' million dollar cars
It's slavery, hard labor, catch the feel
Redneck on the hearse while you walk, it's real
With a shotgun, burnin' at the back of your dome
Three-hundred years left, my dawg ain't never comin' home
One fight, dude got stabbed, he lost an eye
Almost died, in Camp Jay nigga, ride or cry
Cream has suicide attempts, Precious took his own life
White boys can't handle the pain at night
You gotta fight for your shoes, or get your ass shook
And walk around with lipstick, and a pocketbook
You all in bitch, sit down when you piss
Sweet ass, you a ho, watch I blow you a kiss

[Refrain: C-Murder and Ludacris]
To my cousin Jimmy Watson, stay up homie
To my homeboy Mack, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you

[Refrain: Pimp C and Ludacris
To my nigga Pharoahe, stay up homie
To my nigga Z-Ro, stay up homie
If you're locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you
To the king Larry Hoover, stay up homie
To my partner Shan-O you gotta, stay up homie
If you're locked in the box keep makin it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you

[Ludacris]
To the homeboy Shyne, stay up homie
To my nigga Mystikal, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you[Eddie Talking]

[Snoop]
Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to ????
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga cold nutting it off
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's
Cause I'm the type of nigga who's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See I dont give a fuck cause I keep bailing
Yo what the fuck are they yelling

Yo what the fuck are they yelling

[Hook] x1

[Eddie Talking]
If you'd of just stay down and been a motherfuckers real partner you

[Chorus: C-Murder]
All my thug niggas ride to eternity let's ride nigga let's ride nigga (2X)

[C-Murder]
Nigga back in the days I was afraid of the police
Just another paranoid drugdealer on the streets
My ghetto hero was above the law I caught a glimpse of a bullet
That took him down like a south paw uneducated to the game of life I was hated to the grave but the pen kept my mind right
A young motherfucker doomed since day one
Shit I'm a fool I'm a ball 'til my time come
A G to me is like a mil' on the streets I'm a kill just to eat
And leave my enemies on the concrete they say a soft heart
Make a bitch nigga stay alert stay alive that's the code of a thug nigga I wanna rob and steal but crime pays the bill niggas know I'm real So my pain is what they feel I'm a rider TRU niggas gone feel me C-Murder ain't gone die 'til a bitch nigga kill me

[Chorus: C-Murder]

[Master P]
How many niggas want to ride with me
When I'm gone don't my fuckin' soldier cry for me
I want the nigga that did it to die with me
And his mama and his brother take a ride with me
Cuz I'm a killer (a killer) nigga baller
Servin' up the 3rd ward Cali or New Orla'
Nigga like the devil with the motherfuckin' red prints
Fight me like a monkey on top of an elephant
The game got me crazy profecy dazy
This god wasn't ? when a nigga tried to play me
God won't you save me nigga only baby only time could take me
Mama why you made me like is like slavey tech-nines and three eighties
Homies live in shady pray for your baby my first born replace me
This ghetto might waste me I'm a hunted bitch like ghostly
It be a nigga close to me that take me

[Chorus:] (4X]

[Mr. Serv-On]
They told me in this life those who start off last a end up first
Those who start up first a end up last
Last time I saw a .45 blast a nigga who was last should be doin' 50 years
Without parole life is cold but it fair fuck the mayor that coward bastard
Ask him durin' his term how many niggas sawt jail cells and found cascidy
Place me the plastic when its time to shoot only god will know the truth
What's in a nigga's blood is in his heart
From the start my pain was irreversable the book on how to kill a nigga
Is unwritable my title don't sulitify our right to tell a child how
To live his life or how to stop a man when he beat his wife but if you turn
Your back grab your gun we could ride tonight
And ain't no game as I stroll on
Nigga you know this S-E-R-V mister get my ride ON


[Outro: Master P]
Hahhahaha the media point the finger at me like I'm the bad guy
But its ok just take a good look at me I'm no different then your average
Businessman society wants to eliminate me but uh in a few years
You be wishin' you had another Don like me sincerly yours America's

Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me "What's that?"
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg, would like to say
That I'mma crazy mothafucker when I'm playin' with my A.K
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out

You don't like how I'm livin, well fuck you
This is my gang, nigga, No Limit

With the pow pow, bang bang (*gun shots*) and you're dead

Them gangsters, they be fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeaaaahhhhhh

To a kid lookin' up to me
Shit, life ain't nothin' but weed and money
Shit, I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck cause I keep sellin'
Yo, what the fuck are the yellin?

[Hook: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit

"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches straight buyin' it, cause they love that straight G shit

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Homies all standin' around just hangin'
Some dope dealin, some gang bangin' "what up nigga?"
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my double pointin' at his window
He got scared and hit the gas "Damn"
Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to Snukes
Sweatin' all the bitches in the Daisy Dukes
We couldn't no play, from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Navs, bitch you crazy?
She was scared and it was showin'
So we all said "FucK YOU Bitch" and kept rollin'
To the hood, now we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
Gettin' rowdy, shit but we call it rat pack
On a nigga follow nothin' at all
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fuckin' with my Tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See, I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?

[Hook: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit

[Break: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Hold.. hold on Craig, B cut that shit man
Mothafuck that man, we need some gangsta in this motherfucker
Some of that South shit, you know what I'm sayin?
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird source, you heard me?

Here's another gangsta down to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the Tank, yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

[C-Murder]
Well, I'm C-Murder the one he talkin' about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me, you know they some haters
I said "See you later" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back, with the Navy blue top
True niggas on the scene with the triple beam
Cause I'm the C fool, I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a mothafucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know your jockin' my crew
"We want to fuck you C"
I want to fuck you too
You see, No Limit niggas don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with
Cause I'm the kind of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'mma smoke your ass
I don't give a fuck cause No Limit stay sellin'
Now tell me, what the fuck are they yellin?

[Hook: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit

[Outro: Eddie Talking]
If you would just stayed down and been the motherfuckers real partner
You wouldn't have had that problem
But seein, as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without turnin' into a submarine
Went under water came back up with a periscope lookin' at your bitch ass
Now, you have no paper, and now you're on a paper caper
Now, you comin' up to my face and you're sayin: Hey can I hang out?
I say: No cause you ain't got no clout, bitch get out
Now, I'm tired of all these silly ass mothafuckin' paper chasin' whores
Uhh, this has been a public service announcement from No Limit Records

Ghetto Dope, No Limit Records

Part of the Tobacco, Firearms, and Freedom of Speech Committee
Thank you dope fiends for your support, ha ha

[C-Murder]
Let me give a shoutout to the D Boys (drug dealers)
Neighborhood dope man, I mean real niggas
That'll make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Ain't got a dime, but'll ride to pay the rent
Professional crackslanger I serve fiends
I once went to jail for having rocks up in my jeans
But nowadays I be too smart for the task
C-Murder been known to keep the rocks up in a Skittles bag
Waitin on a kilo they eight I'm straight you dig
What you need ten, ain't no fuckin order too big
And makin crack like this is the song
You won't be getting yo money if yo shit ain't cooked wrong
Overcook yo' dope it might come out brown
Them fiends gonna run yo ass clean outta town
But fuck that I'm bout to put my soldiers in the game
And tell ya how to make crack from cocaine
One - look for the nigga wit the whitest snow
Two - no buying from no nigga that you don't know
Make yo way to the kitchen where the stove be
You gets the baking soda, I gots tha D
Get the triple beam and measure out yo dope
Mix one gram of soda for every seven grams of coke
And shake it up until it get harder
Then sit it on the stove in some ready made cold water
Twist the bitch like a knot while it's still hot
And watch that shit while it rock and rise to the fuckin top
Now ya cocaine powder is crack
Nigga I hopes you strapped cause you might get jacked

[Hook: repeat all 4X]
Ghett Ghett Ghett Ghetto Dope
Ma Ma Ma Ma Make Crack like this Ghett Ghetto Dope

[Silkk the Shocker]
My phone rang I picked it up
(Need some weight)
What you need
(Silkk bout a coupla cakes)
I had it all in powder but it ain't no thang
Gimme a coupla hours I have it all in a caine
Trust nobody but my guns and god ask Mac and Kane and Abel
You probably catch me choppin "d" choppin ki's up on my mom's table
I got a big order for some coke
I called some hoes up
I want ya'll but naked while you cookin up my dope
I told ya'll we some Tru G's
See me and P and C
In Expeditions with uzi's
Breakin' down two ki's
Baby that's twenty-four oz's a piece
Cause see if it ain't about money
Then it ain't about me
Hella mail from sales
Hella ya-yo for scales
Come up short on my money I'm jumpin yo ass like bail
First of all you gotta have nuts
Don't give a fuck
Cause when I bust niggas duck
Cuz they know if I miss it ain't by much
Then pick up a Glock that hold bout seventeen
A coupla dope fiends
Some oz's
A triple beam
And then playa hit yo block
And tell the biggest nigga to raise up off the spot befo he get got
And I get rowdy That's why I acts like this
But I still rides rims and them gold D's (Ma Ma Make Crack like this)
Cause I sold crack like this

[Hook]

[Master P]
Nigga Nigga never let a nigga front you no dizos
Start from the ground, work yo way up to a kilo
Get some killers on yo team, keep one up in the chamber
For the jackas and the dope fiends
Fools comin up short, you better get rowdy
Kick down doors, show motherfuckers that ya bout it bout it
Break ki's down to oz's
Never buy any dope without weighin it on the triple beam
Fuck soda use B-12
Keep a stash for the droughts and take other niggas clientele
Check the mayonnaise jar for residue
Cause every fiend you miss want three or two
1. Never talk on the phone in ya house
2. Never slang dope out ya baby momma's house
3. Never fuck with snitches
Cause niggas that talk to the police is bitches
4. Keep a low key
And if you movin weight treat yo'self to an uzi
The first hit for free (damn)
But the next time you beep me
You betta have twenty G's
5. Never pay
Pimp hoes for the pussy
That's the 'Merican way
Clean up ya dirty money to good money
Cause legal money last longer than drug money

[Hook]Imagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know

[Chorus 2x: C-Murder]
Imagine life with no jails or no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they wanna trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga breakin bread

[Verse 1: C-Murder]
I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skin too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rings
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got them FED's on the scene and they swear I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had 'em pissed, ask your son, I know he got a C-Murder disc
Number one in every record store, mom and pops
He tapped my phones, but you know I ain't slangin rocks
Take me to jail is what I tell em, get me off the scene
My first call go to P, put my mind at ease
He told me not to trip, cause it's a bigger picture
And if they take you put it on TRU, I'm coming and get ya

[Chorus]

[Mac]
Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I wouldn't stress it (why), cause I'm already strapped
Bulletproof vested
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my Uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, yeah, by the Melpomene
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And time to time it crossed my mind
What if that wasn't a crime
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's trill to me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, or toss your Glocks with the hollows
I'd kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches?
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in Babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don
Nigga wooooah

[Chorus]

[Soulja Slim]
Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the darkside before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or death? Imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker when I'm full of stress
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible. Killing, it's unstoppable
Long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas that's droppable
Real niggas imagine if the world was surrounded by real niggas
We won't have a reason to kill niggas. Feel niggas?
My pain it runs so deep I'm a share it with y'all
Would my own niggas try to cutthroat me while I'm tryin to ball?
Dog, you ain't never seen what I seen
Murder scenes, packets, fuck it hurt to see moms screams
Picture, my nigga Reg reincarnated
Already imaginated us balling and dedicated

[Chorus]1, 2 Gangrel's coming for you
Gangrel, can you come out and play?
3, 4 better lock your doors
Gangrel, can you come out and play?

I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I can't stop 'til I see blood
(repeat)

I got that gleam in my eye
I'm straight from the grave
Dress in all black, I'm looking for a slave
Call me the reaper, you won't live to tell
Call me Gangrel, I'm straight out of hell
I need blood, I'm lookin for a victim
The Brood, I'm with 'em
Lets go get 'em
Lock up your doors, and throw away the key
You can't run from me, look at my teeth
I'm sleeping in a casket, and kill at night
I know it ain't right, but I hate the sunlight
And no you're not dreaming, this is not a nightmare
Cause when you wake up, guess what?
I'm still there!!!

I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I can't stop 'til I see blood
(repeat)

You can't see me, not even in the mirror
My reflection is dead, you just took your last breath
Don't call the police, instead call a coroner
Blood got drained out your neck on the corner
The sun goes down, the freaks come out
We bum rush your city, the Brood with no pity
Silver bullets, triggers we pull it
Nothin' can save ya, go meet your maker
Run and I catch ya, fight and I hit ya
Surrender your soul, it's murdered and cold
That click with no love
You might call us thugs
Dont give us no hugs, cause we want your blood

I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I can't stop 'til I see blood
(repeat 3 times)Verse 1 (C-Murder)

I guess its bout time for me to pay my dues
Just got shot got blood on my shoes
Two bullets in my chest that I cannot feel
Left the bulletproof vest in the Coup De'ville
I'm steadily getting weaker I don't know what to do
Picked up the mobil phone dialed T-R-U
Drove myself to the clinic with revenge on my mind
Had to stash all my dope and I hid my nine
Killa killa killa killa I'll pull your card
Just got out of jail beat a murder charge
Nigget niggas in the hood don't take no crap
Quick to get the gat and peel your cap
Release from the clinic and now I'm looking for a body
Strapped to the matt like a black John Gotti
Ruthless as fuck and my eyes is red
I wanna put a hollow tip in a motherfuckers head
I got word on the street I got funk with the southside
I'm a show 'em how to do a fucking drive-by
Riggety rolled on them slow in the Cadillac
Silkk behind the wheel, me and King in the pack
Master P in the passenger seat getting ready
Taking out the tech nine putting up the machette
Got close to them fools told Silkk to cut the lights off
Grabbed my sawed off and blew the nigga arm off
Rat-tat-tat tat-tat-tat then we bailed out
Got away clean smoking blunts in the house
I can't trip cause you reap what you saw man
Cause murder is an everythang thang

(Chorus)

Its an everyday thang

Verse 2 (Master P)

I couldn't find a job so I started slanging crack
Ten motherfuckers in a one room shack
Chopping up ?? 20's and 50's to get my cash up
?? this fucking bitch to hold my mothafucking stash homie
72 oz's that will be two keys
Cook it up with some cut and turn it into three
Open up shop and start serving double ups
5 days later watch a nigga fucking bubble up
Bitches on my dick cause they know I'm living fat
And get the Lexus painted everytime it gets a scratch
But I ain't even tripping
Cause I know these hoes don't like me
And every fucking day the feds out to indict me
But I ain't going out on know motherfucking bullshit case
I'd rather slang tapes across the world state to state
Look for distributions start up my own company
So the major motherfucking labels they could hump me
No Limit came up quick just like a bullet
But Master P ?? we pull it
And all them playa hating suckes still talking shit
Better check Billboard the number one hit
Still on the hood on the under ??
Cause selling dope is an everyday thang

(Chorus)[Master P/C-Murder]
Chorus
Where them niggas at
Where them niggas at
There them niggas go
[Master P]
Uhhhhh
Fuck it, let's get em x4

[C-Murder]
I'm a motherfucking soldier
Bitch I thought I told ya, I smoke your ass like doja
Niggas mad cause my tapes selling like crack
Sold a million records, not one disc came back
You know, I gotta repre fuckin sent
My ghetto niggas got me getting paid like the president
But TRU niggas don't yap about it (yap about it)
But when I do some gangsta shit, you know I gotta rap about it
I left the dope on the motherfucking table
The feds mad cause we the number one rap label
No Limit records made history in this bitch
And it's a myth on how ghetto niggas getting rich
The whole world say they bout it bout it
I drop this ghetto shit, and get my thug niggas rowdy
My tank dogs coming through, where them niggas at
Ready to hit em, P, pass me them thangs, let me get em

Chorus x4

[Magic]
P man, pass me them thangs and let me get em
I be damned if I don't kill a nigga
They shouldn't be fuckin with ya
They don't respect a fucking soldier
They gonna roll or get rolled over, or get fucked over
Now I may be the first to go with, but you best believe
Thirty niggas came out here to get us, thirty niggas gonna bleed
I'm here to protect and serve my tank dogs
And any nigga that fuck with us
Colonel, get ready to go to war, I'm hitting hard
A made nigga, that's why they call me mister Magic
Busting that niggas that try it, Magic and laugh
I'm military minding, I don't second guess
Click clack blast, erasing niggas, it's all bad

Chorus x4

[Master P]
Nigga I ride for scrilla, hang with dealers
Daddy wasn't home so I rode with them killers
And thug niggas high off hennesey and weed
Tatoos and oz's, invested in CD's
Now the feds wanna see me dead
Independent, black owned and teaching other niggas how to get paid
Ran with some gangs, bank for some change
Third ward niggas don't play no fucking games
Me and Silkk, C-Murder, we killers
Plus Magic together, a world of TRU niggas
Taking over this rap game
It's No Limit for life, lights out I'm the trigger man

(bang, bang, bang, bang)
OK, I'm reloading. Ha ha
I told yall, No Limit niggas, we mercenary soldiers
We don't talk, we don't rap about niggas
We all about getting our motherfucking paper
A coward dies a million deaths, but a soldier only dies once nigga
Real niggas, they play the motherfucking game they don't talk nigga
Ha ha, yall fake ass niggas, yall think about it
Rapping for the motherfucking white folks
We independent black owned nigga
Ghetto niggas, ha
Real niggas and bitches unite. Ha ha
Fuck fifteen percent nigga, I want the whole motherfucking wallet
Talk to the niggas I feed nigga if you got problemsI'm here to let the whole world know I'm hard to control
You can't conquer my soul
Bossalinie, a living legend
With physical evidence of a world full of curroption and greed

Chorus
It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under, I keep from going under x2

Random deaths on the block, young nigga packin Glocks
Picture me a TRU nigga, visualizing fools dying quicker
Murder murder's in the heart of every killer
Take a look into his eyes, it's evidence of a homocide
Life's get tooken faster then the egg leave the womb
Consider me in danger cause I know I'm dying soon
Twenty five years incarceration if I pull it
Bring the yellow tape, niggas can't overcome my bullet
Went to jail tryin to get paid, still on my rampage
Jump behind some bushes, dodging cops, another close shave
I'm bumpin heads with the reaper on a daily basis
Can't sleep with nightmares of dead faces
Fuck the man in the mirror, I don't trust him
Check his weapon, he's ashamed, got his boy blood on a muzzle
That's why I turn my head and leave him lonely
He phony, he got the whole hood waitin on his ceremony

Chorus x2

I take a deep breath as I blaze this weed mixed with hashes
And trippin how the Outlawz smoked 2Pac ashes
My nigga Bad Azz laid it down
He told me "C, real niggas goin always be around"
Livin in the minds and the hearts of the lost souls
And much love to the motherfuckin outlaws
Back stage choppin game with Sean Dogg and Snoop Dogg
And to my thugs in the grave, we miss yall
I give a toast to you soldiers, you ain't die for nothin
I read the Bible, it said every death mean somethin
And TRU niggas make the world go round
Pick up the black history book and can't seem to put it down
Black leaders gettin struck down at they peak
Open your eyes, that unliberated shit is weak
And throw em up if you a soldier, I told ya
We goin burn this bitch down cause these holocaust days is over

Chorus x4

It's like a jungle out there baby
]From the motherfuckin streets to the motherfuckin top of the world
Shit ain't goin change boy
You got the eye on you, even open the eyes is worse for your life
You need to maintain ya know what I'm sayin so keep it real
And to all my thugs in the grave we miss yall
I blow a kiss
I give a toast to the niggas I miss the most
My thug niggas, my real niggas, huh
Black leaders, keep doin what your doin
Nigga P, keep doin what your doin nigga
And you know me
I'm a keep being a mouthpiece for the hood
For the ghetto nigga
Till I'm dead and gone
Until then, I'm a smoke weed, get high, pour out some liquor
Huh, for the real niggas, you know
Keep it real cause uhh, I told yall
Huh, it's like a jungle out chea nigga
And ya know
It's like a motherfuckin jungle
Nigga, huh, keep it real, pack that steel
Peace[Hook]
Now you're back from lock down
I been keeping it real, it don't stop now
Dealing with the fact you was gone from me
I never let the drama get the best of me
I prayed to God you would step out
Hit the block and get up on your grind
Now he brought you back home to me
And that's the way it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: C Murder]
They say home is where the heart is, but I'm heartless
My trigger gots no heart, these streets tore me apart
But I'm a savage, I took the cornbread and the cabbage
My ski mask got me living lavish, above average
I blink tears for years, fuck my peers
I'm thuggin', no lovin'
My ? Cutt Boys, slash dirty dozen
I know you hear me cousin, I see you pushing ?
But you ain't gon' last too long, them boys pushing hammers
I just left the slammer, the beast is free
I brought the state to they knees, ain't copped no pleas
It's a hundred degrees and I ? coward keep it gully, now that's my thing
And when my phone ring, accept my call
I'm writing Tru up on my cell wall, now why Soulja had to fall
My ? is scattered, I'm a head bussa', where they at
Ain't no home, my only home is where I lay my gat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C Murder]
I live that life of a maniac, dressed in black
They played me once, but I ain't gon' let them take me back
My dog Pimp C he kept it gully, B.G. kept it gully
What's up Mack Boy, and shout out to my old celly
I used to watch ? , determined to get my stack back
Now I'm freeing Renee, she need mack back
Copped a Maybach, Tru Records ain't no flop
Everything we drop is hot, like a gunshot
A bullet to the tizz'op, of the billboard ?
Drag for me dog but I let my pants sag
With the black durag, and a goon rag, shine 'em up
The concerts is packed, they lining up
Real dough boys, like the C of the real dough boys
Make that dope boys, so they coming through that door boy
And ? of that gully gully, I'm rocking like Sam Scully
That's why them people scared of me

[Hook]

[Outro: C Murder]
They couldn't hold me down, they tried to hold me down
The whole state against your boy, Murder mane'
But it couldn't happen, I kept it gully gully
That's why they scared of me(*Helicopter propeller*)

Real nigga

Chorus (2x):
Real niggas and we ride on them bustas
We some real niggas scream fuck them motherfuckers

(C-Murder)
I smoke weed, when my mind gone, I ain't tripping
Bullets flipping, young nigga bout that hollow tippin'
Fliping Ki's on the block, where them G's at
Got them hoes sucking my dick till they knees crack
Drop top 6 all black with the black tints
I got them niggas pushing crack like a Mack 10
A dollar short and I'm coming
Bout to have these fools running
Hundred rounds humming, bout to break em off something
Call my cousin Rock on the Mobile phone, he at home
Magnolia projects, straight from Clebourne
In the city, where the shitty niggas quick to give you
A ticket to the morgue (nigga) after they kill you
Fuck the penn, cause if I go again, I'm a rider
You never catch me slipping, I got my heater right beside, uh
Running from the cops, cause the law, I don't trust ya
I'm a real nigga and I ride on them bustas, I'm a

Chorus (2x)

How many niggas down to ride for me? (we riders!)

My name manifest pain to my enemies
Holler C-Murder and bring bitches to thier knees
Violent killers ready for blood marches
Convicted murderers with open drug charges
Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, 100 round drums (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in thier shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen
Us niggas been gettin paid before we started rapping
Situation getting sticky, call my dawgz on the phone
Here comes the brigade, aiming straight for your dome
Ain't No Limit to the motherfucking thang, we a click
We rowdy, many niggas in the TRU click

[Hook]
We riders
No Limit niggas
We riders
We TRU niggas
We riders
We real niggas
We riders
We thug niggas (2X)

How many niggas wanna ride and get paid
I plan to sell a hundred million records in four days
Gangstas make the world go round
But TRU niggas make gangsta shit go down
We come in your set flip your dope and get rich
Take over your block and your spot with number one hits
Money and power, ha, give me the world
Cause after dollars no cents, only time will tell
Ha, I'm goin through somethangs, fool, so stop hatin
You live for weed and money, I live for greens and bacon
And I ain't takin no shorts with my ghetto d
I stick to plan B and keep my eyes on my enemies
And if you want some nigga come and get some
We ride bourbans and llacs when its time to attack
So throw em up if you a real soldier
I'll make you say uhhhhh, I thought I told ya

Chorus 2X
