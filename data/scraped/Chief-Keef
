[Hook: Chief Keef]
I got all my motherfucking jewelry on
You can try to flex like your bitch ass want it
You don't want these bullets flying like some karma
You a motherfucking frog little Kermit
I'm a glo man I don't need a garment
And I'm hotter than a fucking furnace
Take a tooka blunt then I burned it
And I spend this money cause I earned it

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
That bitch called me on the phone she ain't want shit
Told that bitch don't call my phone with all that nonsense
I be getting to that guap bitch I be guaping
Smoking on this blunt, this shit stunking
I mean skunky, I'm rolling with the funky
Cops pull me over they don't want shit
They just want to say they locked me up
Cause they know I got a lot of bucks
But I'm bonding right out I ain't broke
Niggas ain't getting no money it ain't a joke
You better get some money for your momma or your hopes
Boy yo ass better not be broke
I spent four bands on a coat (On a Moncler)
I spent a fucking band on some loafs
I spent that hunnid on my air force ones
To stomp a nigga in his air force ones
I don't need a jet I want Air Force One
I am fucking president and a sun
Sold a bitch for five thousand and left her one
And threw that fucking shit in the strip club
Niggas flexing this ain't what they want
I up this pump and fill a nigga up
Riding down my block no this ain't what they want
We up these pistols hit a nigga up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Smoking dope like a chimney
Tec on my hip that means that its feeling me
These niggas ain't no kin to me no friend to me
These nigga fucking enemies
Hey the beat go off
I up it then my heat go off
I heard he do that sneaky talk
I heard he was a sneaky dawg
I up this fucking 4-0 then I speak it dawg
Me I take naps and you a sleepy dawg
Catch yo ass in the back shoot up your fe-fe dawg
223 is at your neck, breathing dawg?
Nigga don't even sneeze I get to squeezing dawg
My little bitch a vet she said she need a dawg
She know I get them checks and I don't speak at all
Some bitches bully me and Justin Bieber y'all
I'm in the kitchen cooking Justin Bieber y'all
I ain't got none of them shades I'm still not seeing y'all
Lil' bitch I'm glo I don't want to be with y'all
White air force ones cause that's how I'm feeling y'all
I'm from Chiraq where they be killing y'all
All these fuck niggas and their feeling hard
I'm laughing to the bank like ha-ha-ha-ha
And I got my Glock and this bitch click clack pow

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
Cause my niggas still selling dope like they ain't on their third strikes
Camping out in that corridor, fuck you waiting on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for 23, just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare nigga, (Woo!) Ric Flair nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair nigga, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, coke money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit – ungrateful niggas, I don't like
Rrrah!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same, nigga I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang! Riding for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Going hard the whole night cause I ain't going back to my old life
I promise

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

[Hook: Chief Keef]

And if you ain't no day one gang then you don't know
Jumpout Gang and Cuckoo gang go boom, boom, boom
Pull up, skurtt, everybody on the floor
Bitches call me G Herbo or Herbo baby
My whole city know that I go crazy
And No Limits strapped up like the Navy
Run up on a nigga and play crazy

My girl shoot shit up, she a squirter
Beat the pussy up, she love it when I hurt her
When I'm done, I'mma need a lawyer
Don't got change for nothing, all I got is C-Notes
