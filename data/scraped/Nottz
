[Verse 1: Pusha T]
20 plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby face monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm and hammer and a mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago, if he dies he dies
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries he cries
We don't drink away the pain, when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playing on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
Nigga this is Simon says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying â€“ dead, yuugh!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Troubles on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis either that
Or my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it
Oh wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said "Daddy, one day I'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
I said "Pops, your ass is washed up with all due respect"
He said "Well nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, mothafucka, every verse is a brick, your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession, let's get it

[Bridge]
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit; Barry Bonds

[Hook]
We outta here baby!

[Verse 1]
"Dude!" Fresh off the plane, "konnichiwa," bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head
Cause my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MCs: you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me

[Bridge]

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby!
Wha, wha, we outta here baby!
Hey Mr. West we so outta here baby

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby
I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Megan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them," I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant "havoc"
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cause I'm so avid
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried, suck my bat bitch

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, and here's another hit, Barry BondsYeah, that's right, I like that

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Thank you, uh, uh
Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey), your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees

So if you think you got the bomb shit
Holla at a playa (x3)
And if you lookin' for some good sex

And if you're ever in the 2-1-3
Holla at a playa (x3)

[Verse]
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to
Act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man But dog
You don't know me
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and
I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you
Like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean And dog
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places
You have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb
Ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I
Just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard
So I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is
Like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this
Summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows
In tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am
Present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay
Attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl
Don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean RosÃ©?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man[Produced by Nottz]

[Verse 1]
I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piÃ±ata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiÃ³s I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did

[Hook]
She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas

[Verse 2]
They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's 911 you're on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't grow by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fear of God niggas, got me feelin' like Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know sit in New York for 2 days around Grammy winners
Come back home straight to the money getters
About $14,000 dollars worth in 20s
Brown paper bag money, I call that a good weekend
Re-up gang forever
Long live the caine coming soon
Malice my brother I love you
Liva Don 'til the end nigga[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, ninety-six, for my Nostrand Ave niggas
My Fulton Street niggas (hardcore for ninety-six)
Dangerous MC's

Uhh (Check it out) uhh
Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Oooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is...

[Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas know the rules
I blast on niggas so --

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
-- my fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TA-DOW!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, phrase raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead led to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches (HAH)
Missed you by pinches (HOO) your talk is senseless (RRUFF)
Actor needs chiropractor (HAH, HOO) for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked, you tried to box (Hah)
Dangerous you're not I gets down (HOO)
Twist your body {*singing*} round and round, upside down

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
C'mon, yo, throw your hands, c'mon
Bitch grab your tits, c'mon
Let me know you in the spot
Bump your fists, c'mon
Thugs tote yo' shit
We bout to get mo' rich, c'mon
Let's blow the club, c'mon
Fuck the place up, c'mon
Shake yo' nasty ass
And make it swing all around, c'mon
Yo, make this money
Throw yo' loot on the ground, c'mon
Bounce in your whips, c'mon
Bitch lick yo' lips, c'mon
Dangerous MC's
My nigga this be the shit, c'mon
Dangerous MC's
My nigga this be the shit, c'mon

[Verse 2: Mark Curry]
Uh-huh, make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chickenhearts don't exist
Settin' up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin' but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand
Everything you can imagine is real man
And revenge be the dish I serve to cats cold
Stay up on about ten folds, you know how it goes
You know the streets and it's real as shit, c'mon
Niggas grab your dicks, c'mon
Bitches rub your tits, c'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Awww nah, big Snoop Dogg
Slap you with my paw, all across your jaw
Break fool on these bitches while I'm breakin' the law
You come up in my room look bitch you takin' it off
Follow me, I slip em slide em rip em ride em provide em
With that West coast G shit, L.B.C. shit
We dips to this, make chips to this
And buy brand new whips and shit, uh-huh (Beyotch)
I bet you didn't know that yo' bitch was suckin' dick (say what?)
Who you think she fuckin' with? (What?) Look here
My, Eastside lifestyle is way foul, move the crowd
Point a pistol at you bitch niggas, BLA-DOW
...How you like me now? (What, what, what?)
You got stuck and fucked, Doggystyle
100 spokes Day-tonas, bendin' the corner
All up in Crooklyn, bad bitches are lookin'

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
So you lovin' us so much this shit is bleedin' through you
If I worked in a restaurant, I'd shit in the food and feed it to you
Most of my niggas cuckoo, easy to gas to shoot you
Even all of them Haitian niggas won't believe this voodoo
Can yo' pussy be chaka, don't let me speak in pat-ois
And kick you in your face like we playin' a game of soc-cer
I love to cock the Glock-a, stack up on loot and vod-ka
And fuck your crew because all of y'all niggas full of ca-ca
The way we doin' damage tell me how the fuck you manage
With my niggas who marinate on foul thoughts and think savage
Them niggas'll throw you in a manhole
And push they hand in yo' ass
And pull yo' head right out yo' asshole!
Parkay nigga we rugged all day nigga
You ready to fuck bitch? Fuck the foreplay nigga
This me for all consumers, my nigga FUCK the rumors
Three in the worst way of pure coke for all you DRUG ABUSERS

[Hook][Hook: Andrea Martin]
I only fuck wit'chu, on two occasions
When I'm drunk, when I'm high
I would be broke, if I would be wit'chu
That is why it's fo' one night

[Verse 1: The Game]
I'm a motherfucking gangbanging nightmare, wake up motherfuckers
I traded in my white Nike Airs
For a red pair of Converse, back to the hood
My own niggas acting like I turned my back on the hood
I used my rap money to put crack in the hood
Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood
I showed niggas the Bentley then let you drive it
Gone for two days and I ain't even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasn't about no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college
I'm sitting on the block, reminiscing for hours
Wiping my tears cause now half of my niggas is cowards
And I was still fuckin with niggas
After I got shot and didn't get one hospital visit
My homey Snoop told me it'd be days like this
It hurt my heart, to say this shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Game]
Red bandana in my back pocket, I'm for real
This ain't a pastel color khaki suit, and I ain't Pharrell
I don't front about shit I pull my gun up out shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up outta this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bulletholes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells
I ain't get one "keep your head up," all I got was "keep it real"
'Keep it real' my niggas?
Last year alone I spent one point five mill' on my niggas
After the bullshit, I stayed right there
Took you to award shows, there go Jay right there, where? Right there!
I had all you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last twelve months been a fucking nightmare

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Game]
This shit worse than arguing with my bitch
I done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch
Get yo hand out my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang wit'chu?
Oh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you
I put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Piru
And the reality is, I could die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you, we can both rot
Angels flying over my headstone, but the devils inside yo' box
You wanted my shine so I gave you ice
Then I gave you a second chance and you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life
I shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice

[Hook]

[Outro: Andrea Martin]
Black Wall Street fo' life
Only fuck with you on two occasions
When I'm out of my mind, or when I'm high
I only, fuck with you...[Intro]
Fuck (fuck fuck...)
You know a nigga really don't wanna go to school today
Lemme call this bitch
Get my shit together

[Hook - Wiz and Snoop]
When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
This one's for the g's all black Chuck's on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes stuffed full of trees, I be with the boss dogg ya'll fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot, hundred somethin' degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing
Now I'm hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Money come fast, yours slow like (lean) [?]
Rolling up grass, sold weed to half the staff, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' green smoke (laughs)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say dawg put a little in a jay
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the libary
Got a new batch, some blue - booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass say dawg he just smoke all day
It's a mind game like Kareem I seem to keep migraines
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass stay off day off Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a zip away
But fuck that, this Taylor Gang, what you want dog
Shit I'm on everythang

[Hook]

[Outro - Snoop Dogg]
You niggas never had and you never will
You niggas never had and you never will
I said you niggas never had and you never will
Big Snoop and Wiz smoke with the kill (kill kill)
(x2)

You niggers still in high-school, elementary ass niggas
Holla at me when you graduate
We be posted right by the 400 building
Room 420
Follow your nose, your nose knows (ha-ha)

[Hook]

Niggas ain't hard like us
Niggas soft as doctors cotton swabs
You bitchin'?

Liva Don 'til the end nigga[Verse One]
Come on and go with me
Cause all this company ain't my cup of tea
And we can go somewhere
Whenever, where ever, whatever like Maxwell
And it will be alright
Me and you, one on one tonight
I just want to crown you or maybe I'll wife you
Triple homicide charge, 30 to life you
And I want to love you, feel you and hug you
Come here let me thank you, kiss you and spank you
Take you to the moon baby and if I could
If loving you is wrong then I don't know no good

[Hook: RL]
For all the things that
I done put you through
And all the times I, didn't do right by you
You didn't have to stick around but you did
So this is for you
Girl this is all for you you
You you, for you
Girl this is for you

[Verse Two]
Yo, I know you used to them other lovers
They want to wine and dine you, then sucker for love brothers
I, I let a lot of women before and it's true
But none of them was quite like you
From your ass to your smile to your beautiful skin
And all the love faces you make when getting it in
So sexy
Aye, what you want me to say?
Tell them other chickens bounce but I beg you to stay
Where you going?
You got me up on some new ish
With my homies all night and I'm chucking the deuces
You got me thinking you could mother my kids shawty
But eff though, it is what it is

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I swear she an angel make a thug write a love song
What's between her thighs make you harmonize like
(Ooooh oooooh)
Girl you look good I, want to make you all mine
Banging like Alpine back in the Impala
Loving your persona
Cinnamon aroma
Diabetic coma
Make you wanna holler
Give me the keys to your heart if you wanna
Here for the long stay, want to be the owner
Let's make music, Prince/Apollonia
Apple of my cornea
Girl your love bang, [?]

[Verse Four: Nottz]
Cinderella one shoe, that's a princess
The guy the prince that's 'bout to be a king in a few
We 52 and O, we 'bout to have a ring in a few
Pop the cork, count the cash and maybe breeze in a few
And we gone ha
All your friends is mad
The homie saying I'm Usher in the rain boy you got it bad
I told 'em pay [?] we estimate on things you never had
Life is fab' we just throw it in a bag
Like that

[RL]
For all the things that
I done put you through
Forgive me, let me, make it up to you
I am sorry, a nigga, be tripping
This song is for you, baby won't you listen?

[Hook][Skit]

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, it all began like, bust it
My nigga City bout to bounce on a trip
We met some niggas with alot of things they want em to flip
I told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
Travel safe, you know that I'mma hold it down on the strip
Good lookin, word to mother son I give you my wit
But when I get back, I'mma bounce straight to your crib
On the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound
Wit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town
Now, three days pass I'm still on the strip
Doin hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips
With little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project
When police come we stick the clips in any metal object
Throwin a nigga on the walls and try to search me down
I laugh knowin that my stash'll never be found
Well anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip
Wit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
My nigga hit me with the latest, greatest
He told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is
He said he fuckin wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
What kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz
How they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American
And how they chains swung a medallion iced out pelicans
And how they stay wit four pounders
And speak American to try to blend in
Like they ain't obvious out of towners
Okay, I've never heard of workers gettin five G's pay
For trips that last for only 2-3 day
How these Guyanese niggas be eatin pasta but they love zucchini
Rockin valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini
Them type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em
Rockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em
How they rock silks and tailor made pants
And get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
Washrags hangin from every one of our back pockets
]From every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it
And set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
Rock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals
How they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy
And love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
After all of that I wanted ones
The way my nigga was talkin so next trip I went to bounce with son
So now we out of town with Guyanese cats
Up in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats
Shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
Just like a thief in the night
And spread the word that we was back with the white

[Intermission]
"Ayo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door
And shut the fuck up"
"Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like..."
"Break the fuckin breakdown in the working city... yo go get the plates
And the gym star"
"Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that"
"Fuck this shit"

[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, see how we blowin pa
The lookout niggas holdin fort like they was watchtowers
Buggin on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours
So on and so on, shit is good and we eatin
First nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin
The whole town, see we now own it
Carryin on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
We stackin cheddar now and shit is all clear
And we was growin as workin niggas wit aspiring ideas
We love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
But in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit
Now these niggas was really ready to swell up
We decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
Off in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid
We set up shops and watched the games begin
So now we ballin like a motherfucker, money was sick
Gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick
Fuckin everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass
To attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast
We used to takin niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt
And watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
Ain't it funny how shit transpire in fact
Not too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at
Some niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm
Not a problem so immediately reach for the john
Right away the gun BUST! straight lifted a nigga
How we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga
Wild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats
Leavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats
Now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands
But fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans
Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
My son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all
Word, I started buggin when my nigga said he feel cold
Then I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole
So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
Flame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas wanna rip?
Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
One nigga slid and think he got off the hook
Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
Stupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain
Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
And said his legs feel like them shits ain't got no feelins no more
More the actin up the more the shit I felt in my gut
The shit was all over as soon as the director said CUT!

That's a wrap, good actin motherfuckers, good actin
That's the shit I'm talkin about
Y'all ready to watch the playback?
Fuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers
[Applause]
THE END[Busta Rhymes]
Yo - me and my niggas and my clique be gettin mad cream
Ball in the club, now I'm drunk havin a bad dream
This muh'fucker tried to greet me with wealth
I never knew that I would see that day that I would meet the devil himself
This nigga was eagerly waitin to prove it
Astonishingly, already dancin to his own burial music
Well anyway, he plottin' to do it to me
In a certain kind of way, and started off directly poppin shit to me
While he spoke a couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talkin his shit we watched the sky gettin dark - he said

[Devil]
Well isn't you (?) where it hurts, I'll leave you in a rock sample
Straight up leakin in the back of a church
Then I ghost ya crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
Leavin you old and decrepit like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your ashes to smoke
Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes
I be that nigga that'll torture your spouse
And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house

[Busta]
Got me buggin on a whole' nother level
Tell me how the FUCK a nigga really end up havin beef with the devil
Shit bugged the whole effect the nigga had on my dreamin
Body reactin mentally, goin to war with the demon
Semi-chaotic like a typical storm
So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery, shorty watchin my body twitch funny and shit
Givin shorty sleepin with me the creeps
She buggin off how a nigga just sweatin and breathin so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killin the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect durin the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven
Inhale a deep breath of fresh air
The devil's presence blows a cold draft leavin a scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassemblin now
Simultaneous wifey watchin a nigga body tremblin now
Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbed a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo it's funny how the devils'll test us
But it's only select, niggas blessed with somethin so miraculous and precious
Til I'm dead I'm always battlin through
You disbelieve then cut my main vein that all my blood be travelin through
Somebody got to die, settle the score
Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death
I'm ready for WAR!!!!!!

(*devil laughing fades*)[Produced by Nottz and Kanye West]

[Bridge]
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit; Barry Bonds

[Hook]
We outta here baby!

[Verse 1]
"Dude!" Fresh off the plane, "konnichiwa," bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head
Cause my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MCs: you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me

[Bridge]

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby!
Wha, wha, we outta here baby!
Hey Mr. West we so outta here baby

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby
I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Megan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them," I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant "havoc"
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cause I'm so avid
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried, suck my bat bitch

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, and here's another hit, Barry BondsIt's what you all been waiting for ain't it
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat
Go ahead claim it
I'm about to paint a picture
You niggas go ahead frame it
Since we gettin Seinfeld
On some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck a 54
So it's obvious ya'll gone steady be rollin with some jokers
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn. can you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
(ughh) and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a clichÃ©
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be in your face
Like no speak-a la ingles
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll ulterior motives
Cause if you like it ya'll should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a key
Alotta ice, alotta cream like Dickey Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex man is a hater officially
Probably cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
Cause I've done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad cause his girls at the house
With her tongue sticking out
Like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could of been Gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just poking a body with a stick
Now a days rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here baby, they asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, naww not if they pay me
Mr. betcha that's expensive cause it's not a fugazi
Spittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga keep your two cents I ain't trynin leave you broke
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
Something crazy on my arm
And here's another hit barry bonds[Hook]
It's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go 'gainst the grain

[Verse 1]
No more freestyles and verses killing Sticky and Ja
I'm moving on now, I got bigger fish to fry
Since How to Rob, a lot of niggas been naming names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game
Still niggas acting like I don't get down or something
Like I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips 'til we run in your crib
And you gon' ask dumb questions like, "Can I live?"
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me, you're brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the Mac and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Tone and Poke they better have my bail
But if its over a mil, don't put the crib up dun
Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gon' run

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a po' no mo'
I ain't gotta steal from the corner store no mo'
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the flo' no mo'
Bouncers don't try to play me at the do' no mo'
But when they see me, they say "Search him, he might have the nine
He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne"
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feeling it, the Benz pulling up on the set
Me jumping out, 30 thou on my neck
And since you said it was nothing to sweat
You was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kicking, Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how, he reacts under pressure
'til Makaveli returns, it's all eyes on me
'til the Feds build up cases and find pies on me

[Hook]

[Outro]
It's gangsta, 2000 shit
Y'all know what you need to do, get together
Make a "We Are the World" record, faggot ass niggas[Intro: Ghostface Killah w/ Billy Stewart samples]
Aiyo... aiyo, what up, yo
What up, ya'll, this that Pretty Toney shit
Aiyo, I know there's a lot of hoods and shit out there
A lot of niggas done got bodied
A lot of niggas done got robbed and shit
You know what I mean? We love a lot of things in the hood
But time goes on... and if we don't change a lot of shit
Shit always gonna be this way, and that's a muthafucka fact!
True gangsta shit, ya'll, yo, yo, yo
When ya'll turn my mic up in here, bareback shit
Knowhatimean? Tired of ya'll muthafuckas and shit
One-two, fuck around and clob on one of ya'll muthafuckas
Yo Spidey, put that reverb shit, on
Come on... "Can you feel it? Can you feel it?" Yeah
"Can you feel it..." Let's go, fuck it...

[Ghostface Killah]
Live from Staten Island, where the gangstas kill
Only place on the map, that got the 30 dollar bill
And we front like we got millions
Our specialty is how we willie, niggas
That's how Buck brought the building
And the police is pussy, they protect and serve
They connect, with baseheads then they frisk our birds
Smack DVDs, blowin' herb, I'm in the room
Bonin' these two white bitches, Ice baggin' up work
That's how we get down, fuck Vegas
The black Carlo Gambino, rockin' the wallo's
Blow his diamonds in Z-No's, spicey, verses is jalapeno
Best to leave, when I'm in the big Escalade, I'm sittin' on Dino
Tone Stark, a poet's art, kiss the girls
And bake them pies, clean up, some are old darts
This that real live don' shit, you heard!

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, they lick forty rounds, today
Okay, plus the shit is mad hot around the way
Niggas don't give a fuck on any time or day
Or if he dyin' today, or could he find a way
Blow niggas over 'turf, bitches, dimes and trays
Blow a nigga a jewel and watch him slide away
It's like that, in the hood, he in the grimy say
But what we try'nna say is gonna "be this way"
It don't have to... it don't have to... "My God!"

[Ghostface Killah]
With big carrots and static, with that leaves the bad habits
Drugs layin' in buildings with great big automatics
Animos' in the hood, it's a fact, we could do magic
Splatter faggots in lobbies, the heat burn off his eyelashes
Don't try to pass this, back up or you'll receive something
Real tragic, them hollows'll race through your jacket
Semi gangstas with weak tactics
Forensic scientists called in to display graphics
For square inch to his back winds
They brain and spleen is left all over a fiend's mattress
Bastard, we cock and squeeze after we leave our ratchets
We keep the hood cryin' for massive havoc
No Trix we take from silly rabbits, yo feed them lead carrots
The little mans'll connect and they touch that fabric
The only thing that can stop 'em is that tephlon phat shit
Maybe artillery's heavy like a bunch of fat chicks
Brrrr.... baow! Ain't no comin' back bitch!

[Hook]

[Outro: Billy Stewart samples]
"Ways... be this way!" (3X)[Intro] [Murs talking]
We on? I still ain't got no Twix. Candy
"I can't help myself"
Man, that would be the best

[Verse One]
My name is M-U-R-S
Hailing from the far west
Killafornia, California, L.A. Ahhh Yes
You may have heard of us
We all ain't murderers
Drive by shooters
You can kick it on the curb with us
We got blue skies
We got palm trees
We got boulevards
Beaches with a calm breeze
As far as MCs
I'm the best of 'em
Only five nine
Its above all the rest of 'em
I mean we got Dogg and we got Cube
Everybody with this blue and the red feud
Man these dudes always trying to kill somethin'
I'm putting words together hopin' that you feel somethin'
Tryin' to put that pride back into the black music
You can clap to it in your Lac or your Buick (do it)
I had to do it cause nobody else can
Couldn't beat anybody other than myself man

[Hook] [x2]
The best to ever do it
The best that ever did it
Murs is better than your favorite rapper, admit it
Better than your best
Y'all best to forget it
Murs is better than your favorite rapper admit it

[Verse Two]
Look
I'm shaking babies
And I'm kissing hands
Jumpin' in the crowd going crazy with my fans
I stand alone
Don't need anyone
But it takes two so I'm going home with anyone
And y'all ladies that's looking like Christina
Milian or Ricci I could really take either
Blond girls, black girls, Asian girls, whatever
I never met a girl that I didn't like ever
Double negative
That means I'm positively
The best rapper that you ever heard obviously
Never heard of me you didn't listen hard enough
Been moving weight on your block like a garbage truck
No trash rap
I'm moving past that
I won't crack rap just to get the ASCAP
I feel a change comin'
I got the game runnin'
Back to the lab now they all trying to say somethin'

[Hook] [x2]

[Verse Three]
I write songs
Y'all write 16s
Need to grow up, stop playin' with them kid's things
You gotta a permit
A license to kill
Was making y'all money when I didn't have a deal (for real)
In on the real
Still workin' for the white man
Even if you is moving that white, man
Ayyyyyyye
Y'all rhyme the same word
No matter what you say man its just absurd
Ohhhhhh
And I never been served
Not in the drive thru
Not even on the curb (Hell naw)
Not a warrant, not even a subpoena
Not even peanuts in a sold out arena
That's why you salty
The fans exalt me
Why you over yonder throwin' hate trying to halt me
Man I won't stop, my grind won't pause
I'm moving positive circles like a round of applause

[Hook] [x2]

[Outro]
Thank you for all for comin' out. I'd like to thank Nottz
I'd like to thank Vic for stayin' up late
I'd like to thank my bad ass god daughters for gettin' on my nerve all damn day
And me still comin' to work and doin' my job which is to be, the best
The bestest. That's a word, cause I said so. Thank you very much[Royce Da 5'9"]
Nottz, let's take 'em back

Yes.. yes.. yes
Yes.. the Smith 'n, the Wesson
Extended clip in the vest of whoever testin
Rollin to the party with the shottie with the body
Made the lead put the slugs with the hollows in the heads
With the, with the with the with the Mossberg pump
When it thump make the nigga with the heart turn punk
Would ya, would ya would ya would ya please leave me alone
So I can get my Chuck D on
"Yes.. the rhythm, the rebel"
+Public Enemy+ number one with heavy metal
If I don't got the whistle in my Air Nikes
I don't feel right out there livin in my "Surreal Life"
All of you hoes should know I will blow that whistle
Blow a hole in your throwback and throw that pistol
Pimps, pussy and power, police, pitchers, hitters
The streets, religion, ballers, all of 'em getcha getcha if you don't

[Hook]
Blow dat whistle.. blow dat whistle
Blow dat whistle.. blow dat whistle
Blow dat whistle

Blastin them hammers - I ain't no punk
Wanna +Punk+ me? You better bring Ashton and cameras
Heh.. would you blow that whistle?
At a ho that dissed you, or that clique crew

Please don't depend on the short arms of the law
Naw, niggas be goin crazy waitin for they day

The streets, religion, ballers, all of 'em getcha getcha if you don't

[Hook]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yes, niggas be lookin awfully hard to the car
Bein coughed out while I be Heimlich-ing off
The kind that'll knock the primer off the side of your car
The kind that'll bang the triangle off your garage
When it sound off, y'all'll be talkin to God
Cause y'all are soft inside, you had to be bossin up
So I had to be bossin you down, talkin hard
'til I blow you across the street like a crossing guard
Ha.. I will blow that whistle
Leave your brains all over the ho that's with you
Leave you layin all over the flo' that's with you
Leave your name all over the flow that fits you
This is for you and whoever you sold that shit to

Pimps, pussy and power, police, pitchers and hitters
The streets, religion, ballers, all of 'em getcha getcha if you don't

Man, I don't know
I'm just trying to have fun with it everywhere I go
Truth be told I just got caught up in a bunch of nonsense
Trying to take the fun out of my back pockets and stuff
You'll never take my freedom, you know?

[Verse]
Yo, Ash stop fucking around, yo where's the album?
Your second try never came out my man, how come?
You were like the coolest guy, now we want Malcolm
Who out here too loud, you need to turn it down some
Chill, not now son
Your doubt can't jeopardize my outcome
I style like I'm stretching out in Shaolin
Man of many sounds, I come around
They ask "Who?" like Pete Townshend
I'm O-Town meets Andre 3000, either way keep bouncing
It's wild, I don't even leave the house
And I don't feel the need to reason with you children
Needs to be arousing like a jousting match fouled him
I ain't counting that, astounding how I'm rounding out my alphabet
We ain't even rowdy yet
Salvy ain't make himself a Salvy yet
Bout it since we started smoking salvia
Cruising in a golf cart on the gulf coast with a GoPro
And my bro knows, why old folks go 'There goes that Bozo'
My flow like J. Flacco getting tackled by fat dude
Who grabbed [?] on a back road in bath robe with a bad cold
Homie, I'm that cold
Ash, I just walk around with an afro
And a gavel and I laugh more than a jackal
Crack up, pistachio
Graduate, forget to flip that tassel
My bad yo, that's too much of a hassle
Casserole with Castro
Stash gets blown like it's a gastro, you gassed though
More like watching grass grow
I can be an asshole
I rather just hang out in my castle, blast Outkast
Yo Elroy, where's Astro?
Bet if the Jetsons had a best friend from Def Jam
And Geffen and wed them, I would be the best man
Get it? I'm a breast man
Stick my face right between that chest and
Motorboat those cocos you know it though
Don't no one wan' go toe-to-toeâ€¦. rototillerâ€¦ photos off your motorola phone are terrible
Terrible, Terridome, territory, Tara Reid
Dude from 90210, tornado made of hammer domes
Sharin' poems here, smell my pheromones
Yeah yo, my hair's long
I don't even care homes
Takes these earphones, put them on your eardrums
Here's some of this red rum, you ready boy, here it comes
You ready boy, here it comes

[Verse 2]
On a full ride to Florida State, too high played it safe
Could've been Flo Rida, my bad, my mistake
Should've started Footloose, the new Kevin Bac'
The way I play chicken in busses with no brakes
And Busta was on break, taking a pay cut
I play cuts from my stuff, make everybody go nuts
Now everybody say "Whaaaat?"

[Outro]
What was that? That was fun
Let's do that again[Verse 1: Blu]
Yeah, Big Boi, and don't forget boy
Only thing, you could be is down when it hit boy
I'm just a bridge boy, tryna get Rich Boy
Put some new D's on all of that, with the switch boy
Two chains, two tits boy
You niggas know the deal Blu Pharrell like  Clipse boy
Mike Jack off The Wall like Quince boy
You think I'm just showing my ass, you thinking Prince, Bo-oy!
You used to care boy, you claiming killer but that glove don't fit, boy
You ain't holding no weight, no real bricks boy
You niggas pitching wishes at the well with the fish boy
Fuck is this boy thinking, he ain't this boy
We the shit boy, take a shit and make a wish and find a grave to dig, cause we REAL, boy!
Take a Que get off of the Tip boy
And cough it up cause, ah you ain't shit boy
You should sit boy, sis boy
Drink a fifth, take a piss and take the dick
Sit and put hair on your chest, Boyz II Men boy!

[Hook: Nitty Scott, MC]
These lil' niggas bugg-in', gotta quit the front-in'
Wet behind the ears, baby boy you just a young-in'
Rookie you ain't rough enough for buck-in' noth-in'
You ain't thuggin', nah you ain't thugg-in'
I bet you tight you wanna fight, boy
It's passed your bedtime tonight, boy
This shit don't happen overnight, boy
Just calm down, you'll be alright, boy

[Verse 2: Blu]
We brought it back son, like wax son
You just whack son, yeah whack!
Brought Jill to the jam and got gat son
You don't know what you've got until it's Janet Jackson
We go back son, like that son
'88, you was based off crack son
Me I was putting bass on a track son
I had a ?, smack you in your face when it slap sumtin'
Ask son if it shine like the black son
Didn't think sort of ink could flood the map son
So heavy that the levees had to crack son
And make you crap son, for making crap son
Don't cry son, there's no pride son
You getting stung like dad whipping that ass
For that last report card you had, you barely passed son
Pass son the math, we getting cash, Boyz II Men!

[Hook: Nitty Scott, MC]

[Verse 3: Blu]
So what you thought kid?
You was the boss kid?
You manage Ross kid
I'm Rick Ross
Off kids' heads coming off the top kid
We coming off the block with the Glocks kid
They gon' pop so they don't get popped kid
Then pop shit and turn it to a mystery, pop quiz
Popped Jizz now it is what it is kid
Tom Hanks, Chris Wallace, big kid
I'm like the Juice Crew
I know the Biz kid
Rakim before the ? , Wiz Kids
Peabody at the party
Piss kids off, when I spit kid, talk to the dick kid
Kids lost, run around with the shark
Drowned in the ground, and got found in the park
Tossed in the ditch, for walking with the 5th
He stalkin' after darted your heart
Can I live? kid
It's back to this kid
We pack the clips kid
Boyz II Men kid

[Hook: Nitty Scott, MC]Should we break our bread? Should we break our bread, we should break bread
We should break our bread, should we break our bread, we should break our bread

Where shall I begin? Let's chop it a little bit about these people called friends
The ones you can lean on and your life depends
On, watch who you call up cause that all depends, homes, it's quite a few different breed of them
But the right ones, to break bread with too damn slim
And those ones are so sincere to see you get it unlike some
Who hate to see that talented dude with it
Mad, cause they pockets ain't kilo enough, like a fat boy neck in a barber chair with a shape up
And Beijing with a Cesar such a back stabber thou shall shit on you, like two chicks in a cup
I know it sounds fucked up, but that's how life goes
Never know in who to trust but that's why life blows
So just take it as you go

We should break our bread, should we break your bread? We should break bread
We should break our bread, should break our bread, we should break bread

I look around like I donâ€™t know these motherfuckers
Itâ€™s just because I got a couple bucks and now I'm stunting
And they wanna hang around eat some lunch, have some fun, smoking blunts, getting drunk
Guess Iâ€™m just another sucker, huh
All of a sudden bubble butts they wanna fuck
Cause if I'm coming quick enough then one of them is getting lucky
Cause she'll have my son and then take it all from me
Leaving nothing but the crumbs and a little alimony
When all you homies wanna do is hit the club
Popping bottles, live it up, but youâ€™re paying for the bub
I mean it bruh, they seem like theyâ€™re so nice, theyâ€™re the ones who prey on you
And wait till youâ€™re just right
But Goldylocks got the slyness of a fox
I can see it at the top like Iâ€™m eyeing up a cop so hold up
Stop everything feel as we never been, nah, hell nah, we ain't breaking bread

We should break our bread, should we break your bread? We should break bread
We should break our bread, should break our bread, we should break bread
We should break our bread, should we break your bread? We should break bread
We should break our bread, should break our bread, we should break bread[Hook: Bilal]
California Sunshine, in the summer time
(Repeat x4)

[Verse 1: Game]
Last year Jazze Pha got stuck up inside the Grand Lux
The most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up
Any rapper can get touched, any bitch can get fucked
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap
Cus your body might wash up by the courts of Venice Beach
Ain't shit sweet but my shwisha, ain't shit buzzin but my liquor
Cali chickens go to the Ada strip and come back a little thicker
With more ass than Delicious, that's my Flavor of Love
We make it rain like Rain Man when he played with the glove
I'm the King to you pawn niggas
Punisher, spawn niggas
Playing in green, Paul Pierce to you LeBron niggas
We done barbeque, front and back lawn niggas
Summer Jam, throw your ass off stage, Akon niggas
We drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm nigga
Take that Champion hoodie off in the California Sunshine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Game]
I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire Boulevard
We can't find Biggie's killers so we gave Puffy a Star
And I'm by far, Hollywood Boulevard
But I'm from a boulevard that taught y'all how to shoot out of moving cars
Remember New Jersey Drivers like an East Coast Menace
And Belly was like the sequel without O-Dog in it
Give me a New York Minute
To show you Cali got more dead bodies than the Yankees got New York pennants
Cuz we Dodgers in Impalas with the windows tinted
I duck shots when Venus and Serena used to play tennis
And they never came back like throwing a boomerang flat
See me I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black
Niggas roll up on you, now you stuck in that Harold and Caine trap
If you slipping in Hollywood and you get your chain snatched
I know some niggas that owe some niggas I'll get your chain back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
Niggas already know who had the marijuana first
We birthdays in sour diesel, I was there when the water burst
Hell naw we don't surf, We halfway go to church
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in a fucking Hearse
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse
It'll be another 10 years before you see a MC Ren here
Where he been I've been there, that Lambo I'm in there
Hotter than the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there
Top off the Murcielago like Victoria's Secret swimwear
So listen I'm so sincere 'bout to work out like gym wear
Murder MTV's Top 10 and tat my face with 10 tears
That's 10 funerals, 10 caskets
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits, 10 motorbikes stopping traffic
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid
Don't you ever ever leave me off the Top 10, you fucking bastards, Bilal

[Hook][Scarface]
These are the last days, settle in
Look at the turmoil our kids left the ghetto in
They bustin metal and, ain't got remorse for the innocent
It's just another nigga in the morgue
My momma's pregnant with a son she should abort
Cause she ain't knowin what I'm fin' to be facin is nothin short
Of a, racially motivated killin cause them boys
See a nigga as only a third of a human, {?}
Every time I see a cracker with a badge, I'm alarmed
Cause I'm knowin how he feel, and I'm just bein real
I don't hate and I don't preach it ain't no motherfuckin secret
We ain't first class citizens, and we ain't second either
Need to, get up and get out, and cut that bullshit out
Nigga get yo' own you strugglin at this bitch house
The lack of makin money make a motherfucker bend
If you'd rather me than you die in the end, again and again

[Hook: Bilal]
I made it over to dry land
But still wound up sinkin in quicksand
I'm tryin Lord, I just can't get right
Paid the bills on Monday
Even went to church on Sunday
But I, but I, but I just can't get right

[Scarface]
I lay in bed lookin up at the ceiling
As the fan turns in a circle, thinkin 'bout my evil
CNN on my TV, bombs in the skies
Over Baghdad they fight but they don't know why
What they said about Hussein, was a God damn lie
Raised a war against a religion for oil, don't lie
I seen, kids from the hood livin like they gon' die
With the mindset of be broke or let's go get high
With the people livin so crazy how we gon' get by
Gasoline five dollars, how the fuck we gon' drive?
Can't afford to fill our prescriptions so we all gon' die
CVS is slangin dope on every block worldwide
Since, spies up and had the dope game on fine
Then it's only right for one nigga to go get mine huh
If they injured how they gon' survive?
If they stuck at the bottom how the fuck they gon' ride?

[Hook]

[Scarface]
Ain't life a muh'fucker, first you think you got it, then it
All falls apart in front your eyes, try to stop it, but it's
Part of the plan that was written by the man
Got me down on my knees and my hands, prayin
Forgive me Lord, thank the Lord I'm alive
Cause I'm knowin deep down I coulda died
I shed too many tears lost too many peers
In the grave or the penitentiary facin 20 years
Pourin beers on the corner, cause Frankie told me {?} lonely
I was high livin blind to the fact that they sold us out
America the Beautiful, there's a funeral
On every day of the month, tryin to get our knees up
Huh, it's another chance under these circumstances
My people ain't advancin, but if we pray
Maybe we'll get to live our lives in the sun
'stead of livin on the blocks dyin young, here I come[Produced by Nottz]

[Verse]
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to
Act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man But dog
You don't know me
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and
I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you
Like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean And dog
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places
You have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb
Ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I
Just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard
So I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is
Like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this
Summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows
In tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am
Present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay
Attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl
Don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean RosÃ©?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man[Sample]:
"Comin' and goin', asleep at the wake
In bed at the hospital"

[Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
Comin' and goin'

[Verse One] [Nottz]:
See in my mind
This don' popped up a million times
Our destiny's song, weren't sung from the same lyrics
Turn it up
Hope ya niggas hear it
Over ten years gone, ain't enough to kill the spirit
Cause these dudes wanna be rap superstars
Want it spoon fed to 'em plus the hot car
But look dawg, I grind for mine dig it?
I'm a hustler homeboy I don't cry for mine
Nigga, I get it, how I get it in
Hard work got me dividends
I'm still on my grind till the name ring like Timbaland
Or Skateboard P, or Kanyeezy or
S.W.I.Z.Z. Beatz, the game need me bitch
D. Sloan right beside me
Nigga held me down way before the birth of DMP
Magneezy (what up boy?)
These dudes don't know what the grind is
So niggas stop cryin'
You can't keep...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'
(El Che is comin!)

[Verse Two] [Rhymefest]
Yo, these niggas talkin' Art Of War thinkin' they can start a war
If you ain't ready for death then that's a part of war
I bring it down to The Wire like Baltimore
Come to Chi-Town shorty's is livin' through a holocaust
Look through the peephole, this can not be Tivo'd
Rewind or sped up, STOP, it's real people
I paid for college, knowledge can not be repoed
Here's my story now, when I die it can't be retold
I got two kids by two different mothers
Got men without my blood that I would call brothers
Easy to fall in love so I've been hurt about a dozen times
But it just made me get up and write another rhyme
See I don't know if I'm idealist or realist
I just know me and Nottz are the illest so feel this
Odd Couple, I'm Oscar he Felix
The opposite but we still mix
Whether we be...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'

[Verse Three] [Asher Roth]:
Now, absolutely I've been blessed with opportunity
I'll
Shake the hand, show respect, no matter who I meet with
No regrets, live my life and take a few to breathe
Then I keep it movin' on cause I got a crew to feed
Like cigarettes and sex or expensive jewelry
I feel as if the music biz is simply only usin' me
With no idea what is real or what they'll do to me
I gotta keep improvin' makin' music from the human beat
And truthfully I want the one, not just the two or three
And if it's up to me then shoot the ruler I am soon to be
Cause losin' I ain't choosin', guess it's disillusioned me
Prove it that I'm proven, when I do it, do it to a tee
So tell the blue in me go spew into the sewer streets
Go and grab your rosary and priest speaks my eulogy
I keep pursuin', ain't never losin' sight of who I be
The truth indeed
And the reason why all you others keep...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'[Intro]
(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)
Y'all been fronting
Without a ounce of thugging
You go against me? You too can count for nothing

[Verse 1]
I'm the king of the backpackers
This T-bone contact to any wack rapper
It's biometric how I wet ya
My dialect's an entire weapon, it's set to just fire reckless
Like (1-2) guns swoop
In the same booth the federales tryna run through
Like (3-4) we raw
Me and Vishis trading like a triple beam seesaw
I'm a veteran, the Mac-11 the pump
You could name whoever you want: Wayne, Ye, Jay (I'm just playing)
I keep the (4-5) on my hip
You take me serious then I might trip
About (7-8) niggas and die
Feeling some type of way I figure it's pride
I'm the right-on truth
And that's right, I'm even plotting on my own crew
Joey, Crooked, Ortiz â€“ Slaughterhouse!

[Hook]
(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)
Y'all been fronting
Without a ounce of thugging
You go against me? You too can count for nothing
Like (1-2) like (3) like
You (2) can count for nothing

[Verse 2]
I'm what choice is to option
Royce to hip hop is what, Mike Buffer's voice to boxing
Yes, it's a couple dope dealers
Somewhere that got rich living the shit that I spit (Me!)
I don't re-enact nigga, I illuminate
I know every point what I count like a Q&A
It ain't a arm when it's tucked in my box
Since it's Lindsay Lohan, niggas call me Fire Crotch
I'm seeing clear like a MyBot
I drop my coupe, black shoes, black Noob Saibot
I spit fire like Izod, why not?
To Sho'nuff I'm glowing like Taimak
And y'all crying like babies over the net
I should call you niggas Lady Gaga
I call, "You and Em need to get together
Y'all need each other Nickel, Shady, blah-blah!"
If I die I'mma leave heat
I'mma leave the sun behind, I'm tryna repeat
Don't try to ban the drummer
He's an animal and you can be a random number, uh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I put the gun to lames
Eeny-miny Motown, play the numbers game
Five shots on my block
Is like for once I see like my pops is Cyclops
With both eyes I see you got no sides
Bring it to your Chippendale neck with the bowties
All you stand
Grab a bitch ass like hey, call me OJ Da Juiceman
I get away with murder
That Johnny Rocket in my pocket with my favorite burger
I'm tryna shake it like a Polaroid
They said I couldn't do it twice, call me Soulja Boy

[Hook][Intro/Hook: ANTHM]
Peep the style never, follow trends
Will I kick it with chu, well it all depends
But uh, while your at it have a friend tell a friend
You're now fuckin' with the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me
With the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me
You're now fuckin' with the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me
Have a friend tell a friend
Your now fuckin' with a...now fuckin' with a...

[Verse 1: Versis]
Cream of the Crop, rocking a Double-A shin brace
Said she like the way I cater ? everyday
We born late same level kind of levitate
Sober over ? ? off that medicate, shoulder weight
Drama on the rooftop, spark it up and get high
Look it that in the iris, it's [?] and so [?]
Hustle up in your ?, she gave me ?
Wonder how her jeans ?
Tell it to me
No wonder why ? ? do the sex and the flex
What they call a ? men, she's noisey and adores me
And lures me in ???, cause she's gorgeous
Ain't never met another quite like she
Well well ain't never met another quite like me
A testimony to the two of us in good company
? at us ? at the night sky ?, like ? ? ? ? ? ?

[Hook: ANTHM]

[Verse 2: ScienZe]
I be living like I'm fly with my wings out
Writing ? about what I think about
God-given I'm giving them love
Got the rings out, ring fingers be blinged out!
Boats ? like a rental, ? gonna get these kinks out
Sharp ? like a pencil
What chu you know about sharp, sophisticated
It starts with slacks matching the sky, inebriated
I'm grown, kinda rugs that ? Indian ?
It's bugged, she gave a shrug
We danced until we ?
Raised glass cause we out of that classic gang ?
Skipped on water and ? forget the stones
We rock'em until we get ?
Loving this 'til we older
Young without the dumb
She holding on to my shoulders
A queen made by a queen, her walk mean
She long, gifted and gorgeous
Smile that's ? seen, my heart screams
Curves busting out the scene it seems
Yo ? what's coffee without your ?

[Hook: ANTHM]

[Verse 3: Blu]
The butterfly with the tux, buttoned up to the neck
? truck wasn't, appropriate for the eps
Still we connect on the upper eche
She had it fresh
Her rookie card was kind of like collector's edition, Upper Deck
Still I could, never figure out the opposite sex
But I would, bend her figure out of context
Her mindset would've blow your mind up, like a bomb threat
? chairs on recline, coconut complex, hind legs
Tall as my ?, tall glass of wine, she all Valentined up
For the contest, find us in the candlelight
Will she be camera shy, even though she championed ? beauty Mic Tyson
She's nice like ice in ?
Ice on another ?, special like a wife, ice picks, and ? ya dig
I hit the party with a wig, do my ? like ?
Little penny Tyra Banks, hit the bank with me nigga
