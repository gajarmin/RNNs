[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yah, bad bitches is the... yah

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch, I ball like Jordan and I play full court
And if you not my type then you know I got to keep this shit short
What you know about a check? What you got up in your pocket?
What you spending when you shopping, dawg?
Why you wanna go flex? Like you all in the mix
Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies
And they want to make a flick for the camera
Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was livin' like a bachelor

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Spend it how I like, sinnin' every night
Push start the whip, brought it straight to life
Blowin' on the kush, 'til I'm out of sight
I don't check the price, all I do is swipe
She said, "What's your type?", I said, "I like what I like"
I don't second guess, I just roll the dice (keep it moving)
Keep your two cents, take your own advice
I've been livin' life, like I lived twice

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Outro]
I don't got no type, I don't got no type
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I open the door for her
She actin' like a whore and I'ma let her
Learned from Project Pat, pimpin', got a masters
Girl, improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy
(Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying
(Money make your girl go down)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
No keys to crank this Mercedes
I ball like Tracy McGrady
Before that girl says anything
She gotta say please (say please)
And I know they really wish we would ball 'til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf, it's a full moon, y'all
Toss the money in the air
Watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait 'til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibe should be a fuckin' crime
Wasted so much time, should be a fuckin' crime

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy
(Money make your girl go down)

(Money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying
(Money make your girl go down)

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, baby
Spin the bottle
Truth or dare, nah, you don't want no problem
Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, spin the fuckin' bottle
Truth or dare, no, no, you don't want no problem
You don't want no problem, bitch, you must want problems

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing

Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'

[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
Slim Jimmy!
Hi, bye hater, I flood the club with paper
Shorty got a ass, some for now, some for later
Somethin' like Nicki's, dancin' like Maliah
I'm throwin' all this money, I'mma fuck around and buy her
I can flick the money all night, 'til my wrist tired
If you put in work, this the night you gon' retire
You a bad bitch, I ain't even gon' deny her
She told me, "throw that money," I said, "make it worth my while"
I'm 'bout to empty out the ATM
She doin' tricks that make a nigga wanna spend
Girl, you know you got me fascinated
Just keep on dancin' 'til I'm outta paper
(Never!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Franklin's rainin' on your body
Rainin' on your body, rainin' on your body
Won't you do what I say, start rubbin' on your body
You like hundred's on your body, girl, you need to get naughty
Hold up, hold on, her eyes on me, is that your ho?
If so I'mma get her 'fore the nights over
DJ play my shit so I'm finna crank up off in the VIP zone
See the money go up and she dance on sight
By the end of the night she on endo
Lemme see you make it clap on tempo
Lemme see you get low like limbo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Come here ho, mistletoe, I got birdies, crows
Lil bitty bitch wanna jump on the dick
I'm like bool, let's get it, let's get it
I got these bitches kissin' on these bitches
I can't even count 'em, I fuck by the digits
Swag terrific, I might fuck this bitch in the kitchen
Baby, don't use dirty dishes, or else you might whip up a BURRRR!
My neck, my wrist is a BURRRR!
She wanna fuck my dogs, I'm like woof
Panoramic roof, I drop the coupe, boo
Pull up with a bitch, she look like New New
It's okay if I lie to you, bitch, my swag the truth
Hey, she come right back, that's what them diamonds do
Fifty thousand off fifty niggas, no caliber, bitch

[Hook][Intro]
Somebody come to the floor, it feels like we've met before

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chopped and screwed up
I'm a pothead, true enough
At your ex's crib and you're boo'd up
Take it slow baby, we in no rush
Hennessy or Don Q, that's a very hard choice
For the diamonds on my pinky, need a gang of cool points
And the drop head make 'em drop dead, yeah
Ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, yeah
Believe me, I'm out here, you see me, in action
I've heard a lot, a lot about you
Passin' round blunts like a hot potato
And you dancin' on the table, gushin' like volcano

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
You got girls in here? I'm recruitin'
And they fine, hop the line
I've been sippin' on Patrón and wine
I'm just tryna have a good fuckin' time
I was chillin' with the open container
Grabbed her arm, told her not to be a stranger
I was throwin' on the drank with my niggas
I was lookin' for the girls who willin'
Baby girl, if you fuck with me then we gettin' bands
If you smokin' with me then we on dabs
I don't fuck with local hoes, I told you that
How you movin', you deserve a couple racks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Hundreds on your face, baby girl
Come and do that little thing that you was doin'
Aye they was in this mothafucka trippin'
What the hell they think we was doin'?
It seems like we're fuckin' in this club
Baby girl, what they think that we're doin'?
You gettin' on my nerves with them questions
Girl you know I'm tryna start a little movement
I ain't got no business fuckin' with you
Out the blue, you actin' brand new
Washingtons mean nothing to you
Same way with us

[Hook][Produced By: Mike WiLL Made It]

[Hook: Swae Lee]
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Swae Lee, Lee Swae, it's the same difference
H2O, lean, same thing
Niggas throw sets and gangbang
Free everybody in the chain gang
It's been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee, five chains on
Mr. T, them rings on, say my fucking name, ho
Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine, fool
Never heard about you, all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me, nigga, trill-ass individual
Go and check on that nigga, sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental,got a L full of that killer
Beating on my chest like Magilla
Nigga, I am the gorilla of the village
Pack sound like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains, so they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, "Why you got so many condoms with you?"
I say, "I'm a player, to be honest with you"
Hublot, woo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, wit' the loud, singing a capella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless them

[Hook][Intro: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, up, word?
Now you done fucked up

[Hook x2: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Read my lips, I do my own stunts
Bitch wanna go on a date, pull up to SunTrust
Wear my hat to the front, like I drive a truck
Like I drive a truck, all white Bentley truck
ATM go nuts, I do what I want
I say what I want, I grew up on Pac
Kush smell just like musk, turn it into dust
Man, my style is tough, y'all huffed all that puff
Twerk like she from Russia, try hard not to love her
But she so damn bad, I might have to cuff her
Rock like Billy Ray, that's a nigga idol
Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes, read it like the Bible

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Up like Trump, all of the sudden
Solo cup when brought to the public
Balmain's clean as a whistle, green ain't the issue
Lil bit of money make a difference, nothin' is somethin'
It's so hard to function with all of these hoes in the house
Fuck y'all assumption, my blood still rushin', my heart still thumpin'
Up like Trump, kickin' like Ike, got a bitch twerkin' on Skype
MGM every night, Sremm after dark, king of the swipe
Motherfuckers worry 'bout likes on they pictures
They ain't got an equal dollar, or a nickel
They ain't even got a penny, for the strippers
And they wanna pop bottles, like winners
Check my pedigree I always been a money fiend
All these fuckin' rings, I'm shinin', like a fuckin' king
Breakin' down the kush, don't it look so plush?
Take a couple puffs, up like Donald Trump!

[Hook][Intro: Slim Jimmy]
Drinkin' on somethin'
Man I gotta be drinkin' on somethin'
Just chillin' with me with the haters doin' somethin'
Little Grey, gotta be drinkin' on somethin'
I'm smokin' on somethin', tryna go pop on somethin'
I ain't trippin', man I don't give a fuck if it's your girl
Man she drinkin' on somethin', have you smokin' on somethin'
Have you smokin' on somethin'

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Golly, golly, she love me, and
My woman, my ho, these women
Lit, lit, lit, lit like Bic
SremmLife shit, bendin' by 6
2 by 2, 4 by 4
SremmLife shit, don't answer that door

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Neighbors keep knockin', bitches keep watchin'
Hoes keep jockin', but the money keep flockin'
They wishin' we was floppin', I can see it on their faces
I can point at different bitches
And I bet they all from different places
Look at all this money, lit, lit, lit, sremmLife shit, pop a chair sit
Poppa bear shit, I'm so grown, brand new car, I'm so on
Yeah nigga what, all my niggas rich
All my bitches rich too so you need a key to come visit
News life shit, test this cup, test this cup, do it for us
Four eyed, damn, I'm twisted bad, I can feel it
Aquafina water, go ahead and pill it
Go ahead and pill it, do it if you dare
I just wanna lay it down and run my fingers right through her hair
Remove her underwear, lick, lick, lick
Lit sex yes, she show chest, breathe in deep, geeked all week
Sunday night, Sunday fight,  argue, don't wanna argue
How could you think that I would ever leave you?
I see right through you, get money with the same crew
I fuck the same hoes like you
Switch 'em out once a week, I'm cool
That's mid, I'm cool, midnight crew
Paint the Maserati midnight blue
Money pool, I'm 'bout to swim right through
Who are you?

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Who said they got that stanky loud? I wanna smell it
You say you run your fuckin' town, I let you tell it
Who really run the underground? I wanna meet you
Already tryna bite the style, you know we see you
Before I let my whole hood down I'll bring my team up
You say you run your fuckin' town, we need to link up
I came from that dirty town, look how I clean up
I came from that dirty town, look how I clean up
Lick, lick like Jeeper's  Creepers, wild boy in a wife beater
Hoppin' out of that two seater, doot doot, that's a new Beamer
Bad bitches come see Jimmy, just might leave a tip with you
Lit, lit, might spend a ticket, see if these red bottoms fit you
I'm doin' numbers, Sremm goin' bonkers
Bands bustin', better run for cover
Turnt up, I might run for governor
I need bottles here on the double
I need bitches here on the double
I need condoms here on the double
Rae Sremmurd, that's double trouble

[Hook][Intro : Juicy J]
Security fucked up let me bring the zip in
Yo bitch missing we both missing we both disappear
If I pull up in that Phantom she gon' disappear
If I pull up in a Phantom we gon' disappear

[Hook x2: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Let's talk money shit I'm rich already
Let's get freaky baby call me Robert Kelly
I'm at Penthouse watching bitches shake their jelly
Weed and Liquor make her look like Halle Berry
I'm lit don't wear no panties
Let them kids stay with their granny
This dick you about to swallow save that fuck shit for your marriage
Ho I'm Juicy J, to fuck me is a dream
Ziploc full of trees, hypnotize your mind then I leave
Money over hoes by any means, Me
Eight hundred thousand in jewelry I got Egyptian needs
Grab my Phantom keys, pour me a little lean
You niggas out here saving thots I share them with the team
Fuck boy (But anyway...)

[Hook: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi](x2)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Already told you niggas that I ain't gon' play
Already told my ho she better stop complaining
Damn that nigga already got that shiny bezel
Told that nigga I'm already on another level
Local thotties at this party already bopping
I just walked in thirty seconds getting topped off
God damn why I keep on shaking niggas hot sauce?
Pull up in that new Camaro I just left that sky loft
I promise I've already sipped
Woah, I told your ho come take a trip
If she bite then I know I’m fucking
If she hop inside the passenger I know I'm busting

If y'all wanna hang out with the gangstas, y'all go 'head
I'm just gonna count a little mothafuckin' bread
If y'all wanna slither with the snakes then y'all go 'head
I keep a pedicured lawn so them snakes, they will be dead
Tears of joy run down my cheek onto the soil
I would trick off on your bitch but she ain't loyal
Nothin' but love for you niggas ridin' with no tint
Grand total 5 digits make these hoes repent
Popped a couple pills, I feel like Johnny Mad Dog
I lost a couple friends, I'm tryna get these bands, dog
You know we in this bitch, we throwin' up them grands, y'all
And once we hit the club we 'bout to fuckin' go ham, y'all
My comrades want them mils, my comrades want them millions
My comrades want the bills, my comrades want them billions
My comrades want the tri's, my comrades want them trillions
Yeah we need more than racks, my comrades want them illions

[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
Been proven you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
Say my, say my, say my, say my name
Stwitchin' bitches and I'm switchin' lanes
When they call last shot for alcohol
I just wanna take my last drink
I just wanna sip some clean purple
Hit the car lot and just made a purchase
I just realized that I am a star
Cruisin' my coupe up the boulevard
None of my pictures are watermarked
Got more water than the waterboy
I be on it draped me up, nigga
Yellow bone suck my nuts, nigga
She think it's chocolate but she call me papi
Papi Chulo, I'ma get it poppin'
Got some red bottoms on a hotty thotty
Put them heels and them nipples in new Cavalli
I just came in like a kamikaze
I just walk 'round like a zombie, daddy
I don't like bein' in paddy wagons
So no remorse, I'm about the fetti
Had a few horses come by the telly
Eating each other, they get some credit
Got commas on commas, I'm really ready
I'm really 'bout to pour up on a jet
I would never mention niggas names
Tell niggas nigga never did exist
You niggas never ever been a threat
These niggas never get enough attention
I just put the bitch on punishment
I've been hangin' where the money been
I don't know what type of love is this
Can you tell me where my dogs at?
Put a hollow in your ball cap
What type of nigga you call that?
When I hang up on you, never call back
I'm a money counter, count my own money

For you to catch the new wave

If you’ve got love for Dillon Francis, DJ Snake and Rae Srem
B, you gotta bust it open, let me see if it's real
When that whistle blow, I wanna see that ass touch the ceiling

Just like you, but I'm not you

Oh Lord, show me what to do
But they don't understand
I'm just like you, from a broken family that stood no chance
Uh, turn me up a little louder, say my name a little stronger
Why these niggas keep hatin'? Just like you, I don't want no problems
I don't wanna struggle no more, mamma don't wanna cry no more
Neighborhood, superstar, do you know what you lookin' up to me for?

[Hook - Swae Lee]

I have some purple champagne to numb the pain
Reality is hard to explain
A part of me startin' to fade
Tell me you will always remember my name
Yeah, cause I don't wanna struggle no more
And mamma don't wanna cry no more
Neighborhood, superstar, I don't know what I'm searchin' for
And I don't wanna struggle no more
And mamma don't wanna cry no more
Cause I don't wanna struggle no more
And mamma don't wanna cry no more
Reality is hard to explain
A part of me startin' to fade
A part of me startin' to fade
Reality is hard to explain

[Hook - King Dre][Intro: Slim Jimmy]
Drinkin' on somethin'
Man I gotta be drinkin' on somethin'
Just chillin' with me with the haters doin' somethin'
Little Grey, gotta be drinkin' on somethin'
I'm smokin' on somethin', tryna go pop on somethin'
I ain't trippin', man I don't give a fuck if it's your girl
Man she drinkin' on somethin', have you smokin' on somethin'
Have you smokin' on somethin'

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Golly, golly, she love me, and

SremmLife shit, bendin' by 6
2 by 2, 4 by 4
SremmLife shit, don't answer that door

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Neighbors keep knockin', bitches keep watchin'
Hoes keep jockin', but the money keep flockin'
They wishin' we was floppin', I can see it on their faces
I can point at different bitches
And I bet they all from different places
Look at all this money, lit, lit, lit, sremmLife shit, pop a chair sit
Poppa bear shit, I'm so grown, brand new car, I'm so on
Yeah nigga what, all my niggas rich
All my bitches rich too so you need a key to come visit
News life shit, test this cup, test this cup, do it for us
Four eyed, damn, I'm twisted bad, I can feel it
Aquafina water, go ahead and pill it
Go ahead and pill it, do it if you dare
I just wanna lay it down and run my fingers right through her hair
Remove her underwear, lick, lick, lick
Lit sex yes, she show chest, breathe in deep, geeked all week
Sunday night, Sunday fight,  argue, don't wanna argue
How could you think that I would ever leave you?
I see right through you, get money with the same crew
I fuck the same hoes like you
Switch 'em out once a week, I'm cool
That's mid, I'm cool, midnight crew
Paint the Maserati midnight blue
Money pool, I'm 'bout to swim right through
Who are you?

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Who said they got that stanky loud? I wanna smell it
You say you run your fuckin' town, I let you tell it
Who really run the underground? I wanna meet you
Already tryna bite the style, you know we see you
Before I let my whole hood down I'll bring my team up
You say you run your fuckin' town, we need to link up
I came from that dirty town, look how I clean up
I came from that dirty town, look how I clean up
Lick, lick like Jeeper's  Creepers, wild boy in a wife beater
Hoppin' out of that two seater, doot doot, that's a new Beamer
Bad bitches come see Jimmy, just might leave a tip with you
Lit, lit, might spend a ticket, see if these red bottoms fit you
I'm doin' numbers, Sremm goin' bonkers
Bands bustin', better run for cover
Turnt up, I might run for governor
I need bottles here on the double
I need bitches here on the double
I need condoms here on the double
Rae Sremmurd, that's double trouble

But now my money long, real, real, real long
And I just can't give two fucks
Look, you should've had a check, bitch
(Hold on a second) You could've had a check, bitch
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, now I'm with my next bitch
And you just another name on the checklist
These hoes been tossed and thrown 'round
Bitch oh piu, you so foul
How you gon' do all of that dirt? Now put your head down
SMH is really all I got to say about you
Gon' call my phone askin', "Can we start over?"
She interruptin' me countin' my money, I had to start over

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]

And you didn't work out, that's cool cause my new bitch better
Bitch, you busted, it ain't no more red bottoms
No more overseas shoppin' but yes I'll still take that sloppy

Ho', you shoulda used your head, bitch

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Swae Lee, Lee Swae, it's the same difference

Free everybody in the chain gang
It's been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee, five chains on
Mr. T, them rings on, say my fucking name, ho
Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine, fool
Never heard about you, all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me, nigga, trill-ass individual
Go and check on that nigga, sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental,got a L full of that killer
Beating on my chest like Magilla
Nigga, I am the gorilla of the village
Pack sound like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains, so they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, "Why you got so many condoms with you?"
I say, "I'm a player, to be honest with you"
Hublot, woo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, wit' the loud, singing a capella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless them

[Hook][Hook]

[Verse 1]
Who ain't waiting on King Push?
Got niggas checking for them new flows
Sold more dope than the old Jigga
Now niggas calling me the new Hov
Let the coupe go, planetarium
Let the roof go like Cesarean
Clear my section nigga, no flexing nigga
Just a hunnid bottles they carrying
Cross the border like I lost a daughter
This foreign nigga, he ain't know better
Him pick and choose where them bullets fly
I lose the plane on this fool nigga
Bought dope with my album budget
Play Cloths was the blueprint
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who care for my fashion sense
Tell a ho come and swim in the money (splash)
Broke niggas just stop at the heel
I could body paint you in them name brands
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth
Suck the ice out of a bezel
Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas
Still killin' haters, God bless em'

[Hook][Chorus]
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, But they don't know about em'
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better
But they don't know about em'
I will not settle
Til I win a gold medal
I treat real girls special, cause hoes are the devil
Foot on the gas pedal
Put you in the kettle
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go getter

(Verse One)
Your flow on pause, he so good pause (what?)
I spit too raw, you bait I'm jaws
These whack cats need claws
Hang game too strong
If you short and shy with a booty, can you make it butt naked nasty
Or naw?
If you in the car I put the bass on
I can make a penny drop with Trey Songz (woah!)
Actually what is up, it'll take some
We should start a team girl, me and you (?)
I'm violence so stupid
They like how he do this, (I don't know!)
Take shots and they love it
I feel like Cupid!
Time to turn the heat up, have you laid out
You can't even put your seat up
Bitch you think that you can beat us
You a loser can you please stop, you a vegan
Why you try'na mess around and get brake some people
(huh?)
Your flow like SnapChat, here once then delete it
(Its gone)
My flow like water
They ain't even thirsty and they need it

[Chorus]
No flex zone, no flex zone
I ain't even flexing and they keep on telling me
Homie this is a no flex zone like
No flex zone, no flex zone
Check out my mixtape
LOL, no, I don't wanna hear your mixtape, Tyrone[Intro: Swae Lee]
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!

[Verse 1]
When I slide down the ave I'm fuckin' trippin' (damn)
Maserati bat black, all I wanna know is where the cash at?
TNT tucked in my 'rillo, hundred racks under my pillow
Different styles, I'm so versatile, nigga you know like I know
Jimmy, Lil Swae, hoes on the chase
Cash in the air make her forget her date
Heard of my plan, she fuckin' with me anyway
If she thicky like Nicki I put that pussy on my plate
How you not notice the flyest niggas in the place?
I hit the liquid and started drippin' into space
Hublot tickin', blowin' kisses at your baby
Have fun, shotkilla like Mike reincarnated
Throwin' out a fuckin' end
I'm blowin' money in the wind
I'm sick of wearin' skinny jeans
I'm more into wearin' Louis V's
These hoes don't fuckin' listen
These niggas don't pay attention
These bitches are not yours
We keep them on all fours
Breakin' down', rollin' up potent
Sippin' champagne like soda, poppin' red bitches like cola
Trunk beat like Eardrummers
Sremm killed the haters, God bless 'em
Mothafuckas still all in my bone marrow
Flyin' through the air like a fuckin' air devil
All these broke niggas just fish in a barrel
Run back up and I turn into a bezel

[Hook: Swae Lee]
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Hell no you can't use my lip gloss
Pop a perc' now I'm on lift off
Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross
You bitches, make a nigga dick soft
Bitch ball like I'm at tip off
Get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans I can slip off
Bitch I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for 5 years
Guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me
Do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
….THOUGHT YOU KNEEEEEEWW BET-TER!
Do your fucking research
You ain’t know this the no rip zone
This the "You can’t beat Nic” zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt’s home
I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick, magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude
Listen up ho, this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch I’m hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wanna see her (seer/CR)
Motherfuckers flexin, motherfuckers acting (actors, A.R)
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain’t pushing out, I'ma give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone
Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone

[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yah, bad bitches is the... yah

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch, I ball like Jordan and I play full court
And if you not my type then you know I got to keep this shit short
What you know about a check? What you got up in your pocket?
What you spending when you shopping, dawg?
Why you wanna go flex? Like you all in the mix
Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies
And they want to make a flick for the camera
Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was livin' like a bachelor

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Spend it how I like, sinnin' every night
Push start the whip, brought it straight to life
Blowin' on the kush, 'til I'm out of sight
I don't check the price, all I do is swipe
She said, "What's your type?", I said, "I like what I like"
I don't second guess, I just roll the dice (keep it moving)
Keep your two cents, take your own advice
I've been livin' life, like I lived twice

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Outro]
I don't got no type, I don't got no type
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right[Hook - AlunaGeorge] (x2)

I will make it so you're gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
I don't ever wanna be empty

[Verse 1 - Slim Jimmy]
I just popped a Senzu bean
I said I just popped a Senzu bean
Mama where I leave my memory?
Probably the same place I left my ID (hey)
Y-3's, gave a young nigga wings
I sneeze, gave a young nigga steeze
Five G's, fall like leaves
In the spring Imma run it like cleats, we be clubbing
1800's, bubbling a nigga's stomach
Three girls, so that mean I'm in here juggling
She might have a man, I might have a girl
But neither one of 'em at the club so who give a fuck
Arrived on the scene with some booty shakin' hoes
And they not the twerk team
All these hoes got their hands on they knees
I said all these hoes got their hands on they knees

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Swae Lee]
Goin' clubbin'
I beat the pussy up left the girl on crutches
I'm goin' clubbin'
You know that I'm bout to gonna slice up the dutchies
I'm goin' clubbin'
Tell me when she ready just hit me on my phone
Goin' clubbin'
If you got some foo' friends bitch don't come along
Let me make a scene
Ooh if you bad I might just put you in the ring
Ooh if you bad I might just buy you that machine
Ooh if you bad I might just dress you so clean
Woah, how you wear your hair
Make a nigga want to buy you this
Take you down to Paris and ice out your wrist
Chew you like a nigga did when he was a six
I make it look easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - AlunaGeorge]
All I really need is one touch, I want you to put it right here on me
All I need is one touch, I want you to put it right here
All I really need is one touch, I want you to put it right here on me
All I need is one touch, I want you to put it right here
You're gonna make me drag your ass over here
I don't mind, cause I've got no fear
In your eyes, it's written clear (it's written clear)
You're gonna make me, drop my Glock to the floor
I don't mind, but I need some more
So be kind and make me sure (make me sure)
I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so you're gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
I don't ever wanna be empty
All I really need is one touch, I want you to put it right here on me
All I need is one touch, I want you to put it right here[Pre-Hook: Slim Jimmy] x2
Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody

Safe sex, and paychecks
That's what it's all about, don't forget about
Safe sex, and paychecks

I bought the bar, I bought the ho' so a nigga can't tell me shit

Yeah, gold pack, no Lifestyle
Came to the club with my dogs, yeah, we gon' ball 'til we fall
OG kush on me, Steve Urkel have a young nigga geeked
These girls, they DTF, that train got 'em feelin' theyself

Say you 'bout that life, you gotta prove it to me

Rockstar life, fuck who don't like it
Party all night, party all night
I came here to have a good time
Good smoke, good vibes, it's the good life
Somehow I got the sack past security
Now I'm jumpin' up and down off the Hennessy
Now I'm jumpin' up and down off the Hennessy
I'll probably wake up in the mornin' with no memory
Double shots, no chaser
We party hard in the AM
Safe sex, no babies
Everybody go crazy, get wasted

I don't freestyle, cuz my style ain't free

All I got is cash, I'm gon' buy a new lamb
Hit ya shawty from the side, woo!, wam, bam
I'm on Sway up In the Morning, I just counted one hunnid
All my bitches bad and they drive an H3 Hummer
I can check my wrist, hoo, watch my elbow pop
Niggas hattin' from the side, they know they need to stop
Cash out on a yacht, then I cash out on the crib
In your neighborhood, I make noise like where I live
Please do not disturb, shitting on a nigga, I'm a muthafuckin' turd
All these niggas wanna know what the word
I'm soo fly like a muthafuckin' bird!

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Don't freestyle, cuz my style ain't free

I'm tired bitches actin' like they weed ain't cheap

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
SremmLife comin' soon, SremmLife comin' soon
I thump through like a hundred K like every afternoon
I'm married to the money, I'm the muthafuckin' groom
I never jumped the broom, my crib got seven rooms
You know what's up with me, I'm geekin' off a pill

One to the head, and you dead)

Drinks on us, drinks on us
Shawty say I need to chill, I smoke too much
Every day I do, I cash out on such and such
I'm in that H3 and I'm bout to bust a nut[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I open the door for her
She actin' like a whore and I'ma let her
Learned from Project Pat, pimpin', got a masters
Girl, improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)

(Money make your girl go down)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
No keys to crank this Mercedes
I ball like Tracy McGrady
Before that girl says anything
She gotta say please (say please)
And I know they really wish we would ball 'til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf, it's a full moon, y'all
Toss the money in the air
Watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait 'til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibe should be a fuckin' crime
Wasted so much time, should be a fuckin' crime

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy

Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, spin the fuckin' bottle
Truth or dare, no, no, you don't want no problem
You don't want no problem, bitch, you must want problems

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy
(Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Ass fat, yeah I know
You just got cash? Blow sum mo'
Blow sum mo', blow sum mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor
It's rainin' hundreds, throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'

[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
Slim Jimmy!
Hi, bye hater, I flood the club with paper
Shorty got a ass, some for now, some for later
Somethin' like Nicki's, dancin' like Maliah
I'm throwin' all this money, I'mma fuck around and buy her
I can flick the money all night, 'til my wrist tired
If you put in work, this the night you gon' retire
You a bad bitch, I ain't even gon' deny her
She told me, "throw that money," I said, "make it worth my while"
I'm 'bout to empty out the ATM
She doin' tricks that make a nigga wanna spend
Girl, you know you got me fascinated
Just keep on dancin' 'til I'm outta paper
(Never!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Franklin's rainin' on your body
Rainin' on your body, rainin' on your body
Won't you do what I say, start rubbin' on your body
You like hundred's on your body, girl, you need to get naughty
Hold up, hold on, her eyes on me, is that your ho?
If so I'mma get her 'fore the nights over
DJ play my shit so I'm finna crank up off in the VIP zone
See the money go up and she dance on sight
By the end of the night she on endo
Lemme see you make it clap on tempo
Lemme see you get low like limbo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Come here ho, mistletoe, I got birdies, crows
Lil bitty bitch wanna jump on the dick
I'm like bool, let's get it, let's get it
I got these bitches kissin' on these bitches
I can't even count 'em, I fuck by the digits
Swag terrific, I might fuck this bitch in the kitchen
Baby, don't use dirty dishes, or else you might whip up a BURRRR!
My neck, my wrist is a BURRRR!
She wanna fuck my dogs, I'm like woof
Panoramic roof, I drop the coupe, boo
Pull up with a bitch, she look like New New
It's okay if I lie to you, bitch, my swag the truth
Hey, she come right back, that's what them diamonds do
Fifty thousand off fifty niggas, no caliber, bitch

[Verse 4:Yung Trae]
Step in, take everything relevant,don't care if you're benevolent
Or you may never land well, it is clear and evident
We roll in like the president, lock down the whole district
Then steal every resident ,and given them democracy
With the Axe that's sharp make sure that thing is permanent
Have to get what I have to get , me don't care everything is hard to get
I come take and then calculate , then do something immaculate
Look pon de wall
Check pon de right
Listen to thunder
Look at the lightn'ng
We came here for all or nothing at all, that is the way of the viking
