[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic[al] Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

[Hook][Intro: Romeo Santos]
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verse 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece
Pero tú desvaneces y me ofreces tu amistad
Sin otra excepción
Se que hay otro hombre
Que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir
Perdón por hacerte daño

[Hook: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti, vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque él te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida, pero entiendo
Que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Bridge: Drake]
Celo sus besos, sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí
(Y te quiero aquí)
Odio ese hombre, porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada

[Hook]

[Interlude: Romeo Santos]
Escucha las palabras
Yo fui el llanto
Él es tu sonrisa
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán
Muy de prisa

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you - you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don’t worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I’ll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

[Hook][Produced by Jake One]

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
It feels a way I can't explain so hold me babe
I know you can't stay too long
And every melody has a way of reminding me of one of your favorite songs

[Pre Hook: Rico Love]
And I know we can't turn back time
I know we can't right those wrongs
But at least inside my mind (at least inside my mind, oh yeah) It doesn't seem like you're gone

[Hook: Rico Love]
Even though I know you're too busy, lovin' somebody else And you're a million miles past gone
I wish my bed was warm, but you lovin' somebody else
You can hear my heart saying
(ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh) Are you lovin' somebody else?
You can hear my heart say (ooh ooh), say (ooh ooh), say (ooh ooh) Cause you lovin' somebody else? (Somebody else)
Remix Remix Remix

[Verse 2: Usher]
UR
Ohh, I’m really hoping she finds somebody else
And it won't get better til you try somebody else
She be all in to the drama, But I just want us to close
She all about the commotion, I swear she gotta heart of stone

[Pre Hook: Usher]
Can't turn back time (can't turn back time no no) I know we can't right those wrongs
But at least inside her mind (Damn)
Its like I’m the only one (you keep sayin)

[Hook]
Even though I know you're too busy, yeah
Lovin' somebody else, lovin' somebody else
We're a million miles past done, but I'll always be the only one
I bet you she be lovin' somebody else
You can hear my heart saying
(ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh) Are you lovin' somebody else?

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh.. Thought I had it, all the magic
I couldn’t imagine it, then it all went tragic
Automatically I'm the bad one
I was only doing us, gave you everything
A kid, a house, and a wedding ring
And now you talk about you can do better things
How did we get this way?
How do you entertain that bullshit
Why you even care what Instagram got to say
Now when you see me, we don’t act the same
Smiling on TV, tryna hide the pain
An empty seat where you used to be with me on the plane An empty hole in my heart, will I ever love again
You had your way in you know it
Ain't thinking forward, you still in the past
Ain't gon lie I spent sometime thinking, if we coulda lasted Screaming fuck the world, I know whats behind them glasses Rolling up another joint, thinking bout the last
Cause being alone ain't what you wanna be
And me with a girl ain't what you wanna see
And truthfully it ain't you, its me

[Hook][Hook]

Ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Hook][Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
A$AP Ferg, Waka Flocka

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Some say I'm possessed, that's why Christ on my chest
I'm from the Southside so I throw up the S
Disrespect, I lay you to rest
Boy you ass, you softer than breast
Bloody murder, I lay you to rest
Aim for the head ain't no need for a vest
Can't nothing protect you from this tec
Street educated, no use for G-tech
Niggas be talking but really don't want it
Put shells in your stomach, like pussy you wet
Flocka like Rambo, I stay with the ammo
Test me, that's a gamble like Russian Roulette
I stay with them commas, I been through the drama
You going to war, you better invest
Fuck is a K? I ain't impressed
Got thousands of shooters I pay just to flex

[Hook]
Niggas say I'm real, bitches say I'm hot
Disrespect the Mob or Squad, then you get shot
We don't dial 9-1-1, we don't fuck with cops
1-8-7 to the fuckin' ops
(Ain't afraid to murda something)

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Ain't afraid to murda something, put 'em in a hearse or something
I'm thinking you niggas is sweet, like a Starburst or something
Get 'em a purse or something, might get 'em in church or something
We heard the deacon speaking, I'm Donnie McClurkin frontin'
I smell pussy, them niggas hurt your cousin
All my people say "Stomp!" like I'm Kirk or something
Put 'em in the dirt like "Work" or something, he get on my nerves so fuck him
You turn ass like Tahiry when I pressed your buttons
And that was no diss, niggas quick for discussion
Y'all quick for the tweeting, y'all quick to be tumbling
How about a Vine, 2 clips to your spine and Instagram pics of me dumping
I'm feeling your bitch so I'm fucking, I skeet-skeet like it's nothing

[Hook]

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
It's a homicide, a bloody murder
All my niggas down to murder
187 on the op, that's a fallen soldier

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I'm finna get buck and start bringing the burner
Now I'm beating that ass like Ike did Turner
You sit in a box, you sleep in a hearse
Wherever you from, that's my turf
Fergie Ferg and I'm putting in work
Young Flocka Flame gon' put 'em in the dirt
Sipping on the Henny and a nigga go berserk
Couple bitches gave me brain, then I skeet on they skirt

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah Ferg, you nasty

Got the drop on a nigga, got the info

Diamonds blue, got the flu, I ain't sick though
Six inch pump, I like walking on my tip toe
And I gotta fetish for them fellas that be getting the cheddar
Wanna taste it, said he give me 50Gs if I let 'em
So I passed on the good boys, I needed a G bad
Fuck E-Class, bitch I need me a G-Wag
You see me, you see swag, red bottoms on, Celine bag
Same Louie luggage Akeem had
Excuse the flossing, I'ma boss on my Ginger Ross
A nice ass and the lips is glossy, Han

Nigga we can have lots of fun
Bad attitude, but I'm thick though
Ion want dick, I want the money from the bricks though, nigga[Intro: Rico Love]

See all these pesos? See all these pesos?
I'm eating like bon appetit, you wish you was on my payroll

All I need is me a J-Lo, big homie just did 11 for yayo
Home for three months, I'm gon' make sure he stay though
Bought me a Phantom, I got them Porsches

House in the ranches, next to them horses
Cost me a fortune but fuck it, it's gorgeous, you know it

[Hook: Rico Love]
Pull up on the block in the drop
Aw yeah, slow leak at the top and ya know that
Middlefinger up to the cop
Making sure they see my arch, boy ya know that
Lot full of cars, nigga, everything ours

(It's 1:45 in the morning!)
Ask yourself, where ya ho at?
(She wit' me, my nigga, she wit' me)
(She wit' me, my nigga, she wit' me)

[Verse 2: Manolo Rose]
She tryna get out the mud, but only I could take her there
Big bank eat little bank, and homie, we ain't playing fair
Would you consider, to see the bigger picture?
She fuck with a player, I teach her to get richer
She stack up the bread and then I send her back to ya
Just stay away from questions, that'll hurt ya heart, killer
"Who taught you how to fuck like that?"
"Who taught you how to suck like that?"
Manolo taught you and that's a motherfucking fact
The dick game crazy, that's why she acting like that
Bought her diamonds and pearls, but never give her dough
The new age version of that nigga Pretty Toney
I'mma keep my jewels on when I send her back though, God!

[Hook]

Plus, I got hits like the Beatles, no Ringo
More like Paul, John and George
Old school nigga, drink Paul Masson with porridge

Naked women in my bed, counting 20 mills
And I ain't worried 'bout no banks I get drug money
Niggas talking like they rich ain't got my son's money
It's King Combs in this bitch with the best work
Give a chick a hundred grand for the best twerk
Fuck the fame all the lights and the stardom
Forget about Saint Tropez [?] we landed in Harlem
Niggas standing in amazement, Diddy my name's in the pavement
Worried about nothing cause I'm still counting that money I ain't even made yet
Motherfucker

Bad attitude but I'm thick though
I let a nigga know from the get go
Diamonds blue, got the flu, I ain't sick though
Six inch pump, I like walking on my tip toe
And I gotta fetish for them fellas that be getting the cheddar
Wanna taste it, said he give me 50Gs if I let 'em
So I passed on the good boys, I needed a G bad
Fuck E-Class, bitch I need me a G-Wag
You see me, you see swag, red bottoms on, Celine bag
Same Louie luggage Akeem had
Excuse the flossing, I'ma boss on my Ginger Ross
A nice ass and the lips is glossy, Han
I tear a niggas pockets up, if his guap is up
Nigga we can have lots of fun
Bad attitude, but I'm thick though
Ion want dick, I want the money from the bricks though, nigga[Verse 1: T.I.]
Okay we walk off in this bitch, ballin’ in this bitch
Hoppin’ out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch
Poppin’ bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they can't do a lot of this
Ay, Rico told me turn the lights on
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on
I’ma big dawg, got em pissed off
A lot of niggas rapping, ain’t none this raw
They like, eh look at T.I., ballin’ in the V.I
Bunch of bad bitches with him looking like Aaliyah

Okay it must be your ass cause it ain't your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks, girl

Okay now do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket
Broke niggas looking mad, they just gotta deal with it
Get right ho, roll a dice ho
And you ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoes
For everyday I spent behind the wall

And a bucket full of bottles, bust it open
If you wanna get drunk

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga

Shake that ass like a salt shaker

Bitch, shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse

Can a nigga stick key up in ya back door
Tunechi

[Hook]

[Verse 4: T.I.]
And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim
And come around, wipe me down like Boosie (Free Boosie)

If it’s really too much for you you can bring a couple buddies
Everyday I do my thang, big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacane
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs
I like my women fat ass, pretty toes and thangs
Long hair don't care long as none down there
If it's manicured I can have fun down there
Take you to whatever club, throw some money in the air

[Hook][Verse 1: Z-Mane]

[1/2 of Hook]

[Bridge: Z-Mane]
Oh, kimosabi, big ballin' is my hobby!

[Verse 4: Z-Mane]

Gon' pop it for the whole crew, then bring it back over to me
Headin' to the east side, that's where Sulphur's at

At your granddaddy’s house

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ridin’ with a model, a prize, she can swallow
Tat my name on her any nigga got a problem
Crib big as Lenox, fuck goin’ shoppin’
Throw a couple dollars, you can’t compare papi
Bitch you know I got it, I could get you waxed
Dirty-ass nigga do your ass for a stack
White Reeboks – I ride in the Porsche
Gladys Knight, hazard lights, got a bag for your boy
RIP Gene, rest in peace Timmy D
ATL legends when it came to the green
Wanna start a war with them Miami boys
Fuck around and just make your granddaddy house explode
(At your granddaddy house, nigga)
(Nigga, I put a million on you)
(Had to do ya at your granddaddy house, nigga)

[Interlude]
Boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss
Boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss
Double M G, nigga, we run this shit - fuck

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Hundred hoes in the house and they all fuckin’
Watch dog-ass Gunplay ball again
I don’t see these motherfuckers, they small as hell
Two places I ain’t goin’ – broke and jail
You think you really run this hit until you run into me
We can turn this into whatever you want it to be
I got a bitch in the bed, I got fee in the safe
So much fee in the safe, she let me pee in her face
I need a cunt and a blunt, everyday of the month
It’s a full-time job not to trigger you up
I know all y’all hatin’, I’m the nigga you love
Fresh out the cuff spot and fill up the club
You say you got hoes, nigga, how many?
Show me one and I bet I’ve been all in it
Every day since then she been callin’ me
I was all in that pussy smokin’ Paul Lemon

[Hook]
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt[Hook]
All I wanted was a bank roll
So I went and got one
I don’t know what these niggas wanna hate for
I guess more money more problems
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
It was all a dream, I used to read word on magazine
Niggas used to smoke, but now it's lean
Niggas used to dance in the club
Now they’re standing on the tables and scream
I bought a hundred bottles one time
I ain’t even drink shit
Champagne for the dimes, guess we got something in common
We both like pink shit
Diamond chain, white mink shit
80 thousand Cuban link shit
Made a mill off, they don’t know
From telling these hoes that lose lips might sink ships
Spent the weekend abroad with a broad
Her best friend, she brought friends, we’re abroad
Saved her name in my phone as Dior
And my dick get hard when Dior call
Might see me spinning off with a bad bitch
Screaming out one of Puff's adlibs
Take that, take that

[Hook]
Turn the lights on
All I wanted was a bank roll (bank, bank)
So I went and got one
I don’t know what these niggas wanna hate for
I guess more money more problems
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Pass that shit, nigga
Young nigga, I’ll be flipping that
So much different tracks, made a hundred for triple that with my nigga black
Goon sticks, I gotta stick with that, I gotta live with that
After screaming, free my nigga Champ
Get my nigga back
Lil my niggas, where my niggas at
Fresh money, we know how to act
Bitch, I’m hungry, where my dinner at?
Before I put a bullet in it, in your fitted cap
On the block, we was selling hard, we was never soft
Any niggas trying to get it off, we gonna get involved
If there’s drama what is hitting for, we gonna hit them off
Bang your block, then I let it off, then I'm speeding off
On the cops with a fancy car
Check my watch, it's an Audemar
Bitch, I ball like it’s no tomorrow
And my bitch, she like 44
But she a bad bitch and every time a nigga smash it
She got me screaming Diddy adlibs
(Take that, take that)

[Hook]
Turn the lights on
All I wanted was a bank roll (bank, bank)
So I went and got one
I don’t know what these niggas wanna hate for
I guess more money more problems
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Bridge: Rico Love]
She say, “oh, Rico, I love you so”
What you’re doing, I’ll never know
Maybe cause you had a soul
So fucking incredible, incredible
Father, forgive me for I’ve sinned
Father, forgive me for I’ve sinned
All I wanted was a bank roll
Father, forgive me for I've sinned

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
All I wanted was a bank roll
A hundred thousand dollars worth a bank roll
And I don’t need to smoke, but my niggas do
I just need a couple old schools, I can paint in gold
Driveway looking like the Grammies
My bae looking for her panties
Nowadays niggas buying stock
But back in my days everybody wanted candy
Spend us on a dropped top
Stopped at the light, but they still move
Head broke off, so far to the left
When the wave move on, they gonna fuck around and kill you
Now I got her phantom rose
But back then I couldn’t get her ... jaws
Got rich before I got famous
Sit naughty on my dick, like my dick got the antidote
It’s a gift just to see the light
Most niggas can’t handle those
My bitch had mosquito bites
Got rich, and I switched her for cantaloupes
Fuck living average
A nigga trying to live lavish
And every time I spend a million bucks
I stand up in my truck and I scream to these hot lips

Take that, take that
Turn the lights on(Verse)
You were always the life of the party
But when you go and give yo life to somebody
It's like you find more pain than pleasure
You know you can't play that game forever

How long you gon carry on, carry on like this?
Different city every night still lookin for a nigga who gon wife it

(Chorus)
Bitches be like
Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
Bitches be like
Tonight I'm gonna kill em
Takin pictures with no filter
Bitches be like
Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
Bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Bitches be like

(Verse)
Uh, you've been tryna do it since ‘92
That pussy sick now, you got vagina flu
Fuck you tryin to do? You ain't from DC
But you had the million man march up inside of you
Word to them rubbers in yo trash can
OGs and they younger brothers broke that ass in
Damn! These bitches be like
Poke my ass out and that's 150 likes
Rocked 150 mics
But only backstage, we just stayed for the night
No talent but she know Jimmy Fallon
No house, no car but she be stylin

(Chorus)
Bitches be like
Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
Bitches be like
Tonight I'm gonna kill em
Takin pictures with no filter
Bitches be like
Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
Bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Bitches be like

(Bridge)
But I know somewhere out there there's a nigga who loves you
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Even though somewhere out there there's a lot of niggas who've worked you
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like

(Verse)
Now I ain't judging, I just tell it how it is
You know what you do, you know what you did
You be takin trips, you won't be wit yo kid
They don't be wit you, they be at yo mama crib
While you just be getting flipped

(Chorus)
Bitches be like
Hair done, nails done
But I ain't got nowhere to stay
Bitches be like
Tonight I'm gonna kill em
Takin pictures with no filter
Bitches be like
Uh it's a lot of rich niggas in the club
I'mma make one of these niggas fall in love
Bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
These, these bitches be like
Bitches be like[Verse 1]
Throwed, 'bout to OD on PJ
Five cherry bombs for me and send three to the DJ
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, holmes
I don't know him but he played my favorite Jigga song
Where the fuck my keys? Oh shit, I valeted
Wit' this pretty bitch who visitin' from LA
I caught a contact, she smokin' Cali
She my motivation, shout out to Kelly
Whoa, lover, I hope you go down
And I'm fucked up but so the fuck what?
I'm 'bout to order me a couple more rounds
I'mma ball so hard that she gotta think about a nigga
Whenever she touch this town

[Hook]
'Bout to do some freaky thangs, back seat of the Range
I paid for that flight so sex will be exchanged
I heard yo' head was craze, well, my dick is deranged
'Bout to blow yo' back up out the frame
Champagne is my Viagra, champagne is my Viagra
Yeah, turn the lights on

[Verse 2]
Rollin' down the highway listenin' to my shit
Jumpin' in that pussy head first like a mosh pit
I ain't into cuffin' but I hold that pussy hostage
Hope you keep a secret, don't wanna wake up on Bossip
Please don't take no pictures, please don't take no pictures
'Specially wit' my jewelry on, damn, these hoes so vicious
A lotta ass up in yo' jeans, I got a $100,000 in my britches
Let's stop by Take One and shower bitches wit' these riches
Heh, hood nigga to the death, ho
Eyes low, but I don't want no rest though
I just wanna put it in, and press "go"
And I really hope you lesbo

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Throwed, 'bout to OD on PJ
Five cherry bombs for me and send three to the DJ
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, holmes

Please don't take no pictures, please don't take no pictures
'Specially wit' my jewelry on, damn, these hoes so vicious
A lotta ass up in yo' jeans, I got $100,000 in my britches
Let's stop by Take One and shower bitches wit' these riches

[Hook][Intro: Rico Love]
Sweetheart, let me make you understand something
These bitch always gonna have a problem with you
For one you bad as a motherfucker
For two, your nigga have money

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Keke and Te-te got Dre-dre and Ri-ri
My theme song on repeat, Mesha she a rider
Throwing dick inside her
No Baby Phat no BeBe
Isabel Marant, Emilio Pucci, Christian Louboutin
Sara operated careless
Mouth on me she do it wrong
Tonya get on top of me, probably while blowing strong
Excuse me, meant to say A+
Fuck up her hair and makeup
In her deep, she go to sleep
And when I leave she don't wake up

[Hook: Rico Love & (Kevin Gates)]
When I walk in with that bag
She know it's gon' be raining
Spending all that paper, it's a damn shame ain't it?
My little mama bad
Outfit look like it's painted
When I threw that money up them hoes fainted
(Them bitches mad, but my ho ain't complaining
Them bitches mad, but my ho ain't complaining
Them bitches mad, but my ho ain't complaining
I buy her what she want and the world can't understand it
Them bitches mad, but my ho ain't complaining
My ho ain't complaining)

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Cocaine Aston Martin, I just bought that (I been scared to drive it)
My P.O. find out he probably ask me "how the fuck you buy it?"
Pull into the club with a bag full of bands (Scurr) and a Maserati
Pants sagging, got it raining, her body painted
All the bitches turn they nose up, no my ho she's not complaining
Spend a night with me vacation taken never make it famous
Head back to my trap, pull up in that Mercedes
Say she feel it in her stomach, grip her waist, she making faces

[Hook: Rico Love & Kevin Gates]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Ice melting, champagne bottles
White sand around me, pay to watch her
Bad bitches in two-pieces your dame out here, wanna mainline her
I stay grinding, I can't stop it need eight commas my strap on me
No seat-belt, make it spray, M-I-A, yeah he felt it
Big nuts with a lot of heart and a foreign car with a foreign broad
No rest and relaxation all my keys probably say "R&R"
Back to jail with this pistol then that might make me a falling star

[Hook: Rico Love & Kevin Gates][Produced by Jonsin, Rico Love, Romano, and Mr. Morris]

[Intro]
I know you think I'm afraid
To take a chance, and go to the deep end
Usher baby
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trekking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me baby
Shedding all your innocence
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

[Hook]
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

[Verse 2]
Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me
I don't need a life saver
Baby going deeper ain't gon kill me
And I know the rush you get from me
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby
You'll be my place to hide, all night
I'm not afraid to try
And knew i, don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive

[Hook]
It's raining inside your bed[Produced by Salaam Remi & Rico Love]

[verse]
Hey love, hey love
Don't tell me you changed your mind

I was hoping
Tomorrow morning
We'd wake up, together
Just tell me which side is your side

[hook]
Don't tell me now
Don't tell me, don't tell me
That you feel like we're moving too fast
Don't turn me down
Cuz we made it all the way across town
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Can't believe you gonna do me like that
Don't turn me down

[verse]
Hey love, hey love

Told me you like that plan just fine

[hook]
Don't tell me now
Don't tell me, don't tell me

Don't tell me, don't tell me
Can't believe you gonna do me like that
Don't turn me down

[bridge]
I'm only, here for your service
Don't tell me, i make you nervous
Using flattery to comfort me, somehow

It's like you tease me, on purpose
I promise, this will be worth it
Don't turn me down

[hook]
Don't tell me now
Don't tell me, don't tell me
That you feel like we're moving too fast
Don't turn me down

Bossed up need no help
They say fly girls have more fun
Get wasted like we on the run
First we turn the party out
Then I turn shorty out
European car, put your luggage by the engine
I'll be Ross-stein then you could be my Ginger
(Montana) Shorty cash out I don't sell dreams
You got a V12? I got 12 V's

[Hook: Rico Love]
Do girl, what you do girl?

Drink freely

[Interlude: Rico Love]
Ahhooooo...

We livin' stress free ain't worry 'bout a damn thing
See you workin' hard, go enjoy yourself
Drop top breeze good for your health
Holler if you need me I'll kidnap you for the month
I throw them doors up and tell her go in for the punt
We don't use G5's, water planes
Land on your surfboard, hop out with my shirt off
(Montana) Gold chains like Notre Dame
Wakin' up wasted, do the walk of shame - hah!

[Hook] + [Interlude]

[Rico Love]
Yeah, yo P, tell the waitress
Send like 50 bottles over to shorty
Yeah, turn the lights on

I can tell when you got dressed tonight
Girl you took your time
Might as well have a few shots on me
Girl the pleasure's mine, yeahh
And I ain't tryin' to crowd you baby
I just wanna play my part
There's a lot of niggas 'round you baby
But all them niggas do is talk
And I'm thinkin' where they clash at?
IPhone 5, check your NASDAQ at the party's wherever your ass at
100 grand large in the 'rari where my stash at
Corny shit I'm past that, TTLO with the hashtag

[Hook] - 2X

[Interlude]

[French Montana]
Montana, Rico, hahhh~!Watch this
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1: Plies]
Your pussy so good
I wanna put alarm on it
Like baby food, I wanna put my tongue on it
If you’s a stripper baby
I’d put the ones on it
I love getting on that liquor
And going dumb on it
I want it off the market
Put it in the freezer
And when I slide through
You can unfreeze it
You got flowers in
You got that good seed
Like being in the rain
You get wet easy

[Hook: Rico Love & Plies]
I swear the pussy so good
I might fuck around and put something on it
She said what you got on it?
I said anything that you want girl
But if I buy them bags, buy them shoes, buy them purse
Then nobody better not be getting that pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
And if I paid them bills every month on the first
Then nobody better not be getting my pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
I swear you do it so good
I swear
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2: Plies]
You won’t get the voicemail
I answer you first call
Even if your light red
We still talk
You're like sushi, baby
I give it to you straight raw
And I’m breaking bread, you the first off
You like Florida to me, you stay warm
I’m the real Energizer bunny
But the hood version I keep going
We start off with kisses
You hear me snoring
I show off your finesse
Then I hit you with bam bam bam

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Plies]
When it come to the snatch, you a poster child
When it come to get it in, you versatile
When it come to the threads, got your own style
When it come to me, though
Make you throw in the towel
Your back cute, your ass better
My ex was good, but you even better
Need to run for office, the White House
If it’s bout how good your sex is, you gon' win hands down

[Hook][Verse 1]
Give me joy, give me violence
Give me noise, give me silence
Hear my voice, feel my torment
But don't rejoice, when I lay dormant
America, told me what I should feel
And there it was to my surprise I learned that nothing's real
And those clouds only come out when it rains
So don't get too comfortable, just stand there and take even if you gotta fake it

[Hook]
They told me to stay for the kids, so I did
They say love’s only meant for the happy ones
So why do I feel like this?
Don’t call a quits, stay for the kids
But what we gonna do when they grow up
Stay for the kids
But what we gonna do when they grow up
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2]
She say she love a nigga, she say she love a nigga
But if you fuck up, she gon' go and fuck another nigga
You wanna hate her, but you feel too deep in love with her
Now you got kids by it, and you know bloods thicker
No longer doing things that we once did
Eyes rolling, attitude over dumb shit
Direct deposit, you be smiling when the funds hit
For a second, then you bringing up that one bitch
Yeah I hit it, I’ll admit it
Yeah, yeah I did it, when I shoulda been committed
The gloved fitted, so I would not be acquitted
Sentenced to death to us apart, who's fault is it?
And those clouds only come out when it rains
I just hope I get a couple of visits
So don't get too comfortable
Just stand there and take even if you gotta fake it

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah
Feel real good

[Verse 1]
Mirrors on the ceiling
Cameras on the corners of the be-ed
Yeah
I barely know you
But I’m feeling
Like you really did something to my head
Yeah
It’s close to midnight
And I just want to be up in your ha-air
Yeah right on
And I’ll be alright
As long as I feel your body right the-ere

[Break]
It seems so crystal clear
I know that

[Pre-Chorus]
Every bodies
Somebodies

Say it again

Every bodies
Somebodies

The question is
Who's to you
Right on
Can I be your your your your your
Freak
Can I be your your your your your
Freak

[Verse 2]
Don't need no television
I’ll just watch your body going do=own
Yeah
Ill touch you with precision
Go crazy when you make those sounds
Feels like the best dream
But this time baby
You can be the star
A freaky sex dream
Read your lines
Make sure you play your parts
And when you get next to me
Turn the lights out

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
The question is

[Verse 3]
Vases
Chandeliers
Glass of wine
Can of beer
Alcohol came interfere
Here's the wheel
Can you steer
Don't need to get senalier
You perform
I will cheer
You can scream
No one hears
Feature face
No one cares
The floor appears to be yours
Go head
Pop the champagne
It’s like were on a world tour
The sex will be your campaign cause

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
The question is
Who's to you
Right on
Can I be your your your your
Your Freak

[Outro]
I think that's enough
Turn the lights on[Hook]
Freak, some gyal ah freak ah di week

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Lights up the fire, you know we get higher
Rolling up loud, real niggas moving quiet
Like it then I buy it, you donkeys on a diet
Bringing all my jewels, how you know I start a riot
Riding with the bliquor, messing up her make up
You blowing up her phone, she ain't trying to pick up
Drinking out the bottle, I'm leaning with a model
I throw a hundred racks up, you think I hit the lotto
Riding with the wolves, I ain't talkin Minnesota
Shorty coming over, go and bend it over
Let me plank on it, put a drink on it
Heard you a freak, put my name on it (Montana!)

[Hook]

[Bridge: French Montana]
This girl tell me, say she horny
She want to give it to me out the door
This girl fuck me like she know me
She backed it up then she tipped on her toes

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
He said he met this little girl by the name of Onika
Way my body shape, all the boys wanna freak her
Brag and I boast, they be doin the most
If I look at his friend, he'll be grippin the toaster
So I took him to the crib to kill him with it
Put my legs behind my head, I hit the ceiling with it
When I put it in his mouth I couldn't believe it
He looked me in my eyes and said he wanna breed it
Passa Passa, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Big fat pussy; Mufasa
Hit up Green Acres, hit up Kings Plaza
Some of them say them gully, some of them say them gaza

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]
Where my bad bitches at?
Where my bad bitches at?
Pretty gang make noise
Pretty gang make noise
Pretty gang act the fuck, act the-act the fuck up

[Bridge 3: French Montana]
Where my bad bitches at?
Where my bad bitches at?
Rude girls make noise
Rude girls make noise
Rude girl act the fucked up, act, act the fuck up
Act the fuck up, act, act the fuck up

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Young Money, I don't even say my name anymore, playnigga
I don't even say playboy, I say playnigga
And what the fuck you talking about with them fake figures?
I come through like, I mean no Nicki
I came through South side Jamaica Queen bitch
And everyboody know you're on my dick
Montana
