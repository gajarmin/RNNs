[Verse 1]
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)

[Hook]
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and woah
Yeah, and you know how that shit goes
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go, yeah, and you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

I was running through the 6 with my woes

With my woes[Produced By: Boi-1da & Vinylz]

[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(I, straight up, look)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd and Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
Cause that implies that we back from something
If we back from something there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I couldn't give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed[Produced by Boi-1da, Frank Dukes, Noah "40" Shebib, & Nineteen85]

[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

[Verse]
The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake] ×9
Could it be the way that I'll catch up[Produced by Boi-1da & OB O'Brien]

[Verse 1]
I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin’ online, that ain’t part of my day

But my actin’ days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yeah

[Hook 2]
I got enemies,  got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin’ with the kid and pray for your nigga

[Verse 2]
I got people talkin’ down, man, like I give a fuck
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin’ shit just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin’ me about the code for the wifi
So they can talk about they timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain’t really friends
Ex-girl she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gonna be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon’ see
I got money in the courts so all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales ‘bout how they gon’ run up on me
Well, run up when you see me then and we gon’ see

[Hook 2]
I got enemies,  got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin’ with the kid and pray for your nigga

[Verse 3]
Nah, fuck all of you niggas, I ain’t finished
Y’all don’t wanna hear me say it’s a go
Y’all don’t wanna see Win Win, 50 a woe
I got real ones livin’ past Kennedy Road
I got real ones with me everywhere that I go
I’m tryna tell ya, I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Every time I see ‘em somethin’ wrong with their memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
So tired of savin’ all these niggas, mayne
Yeah, run up

[Hook 2]
I got enemies,  got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin’ with the kid and pray for your nigga

[Outro]
I'm off this, man[Hook]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 1]
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

[Hook]

[Intro: Lalah Hathaway]
They want us to bow down to our knees
And pray to the God we don't believe

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Hook: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

[Outro: produced by Terrace Martin][Intro]
Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like
Fo real
This life shit is everywhere, you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take ya down through there
Make me wanna take ya down through there
I'll take it there

[Hook 1]
Why you never come to where I stay at?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay at?
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw, man

[Verse]
Me and you are playing house, start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

[Hook 2]
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw man[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Rat nigga got my chain snatched
And he didn't even get the chain back
On the news with the police, now he talking on twitter I ain't playing that
Fuck all that Meek you gotta chill shit
I be on some get a nigga killed shit
Put a hundred bands on you real quick
My Philly niggas make a movie outcha Will Smith
Oh lord oh lord what you yelling nigga
Penthouse nice fresh out the cellar nigga
All that white like what you selling nigga
My chain look like a Coogi with all these colors nigga
I be on money since nineteen, twenty
I may be twenty-one I have bout 3hunnid
And I ain't talking bout Chief Keef or Lil' Reese
But all my niggas keep heat a little piece
With a drum on that bitch no chicken all beef
For you fuck ass rappers that be talking they all sweet
Last night I hit my hood with all my chains on
Two hundred fifty thou had a Mulsanne on
A broke nigga get it from me and his pain gone
But he'll never get it from me he'll get rained on
I tell em wear it to your funeral be stuntin' while they viewing you
Everybody goons 'til we send that 32 at you
Sipping on lean with the percs pharmaceutical
Just so I can get in my bag in the studio
Headshot we ain't shooting low
So many holes in ya they gone call you Julio
Oops I mean Hole-I-O, Holyfield knows he’s broke
Shooting at your Rolls Royce turn it to the holy ghost
Holy smokes, caught the whole thing that was overdose
Overkill watched the news so I know its real

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
That's why I'm like fuck y'all niggas
Cause I ain't never trust y'all niggas
And I be like fuck y'all bitches
And I'll never cuff y'all bitches
Cause these hoes ain't loyal and niggas ain't either
When it go down you calling for hittas that you ain't feeding
You ain't real nigga
Your day ones ain't even still with you
You left them starving you an ill nigga
Same niggas you calling to kill with you
But I be in the field nigga
And when it come to money I get it
I fill up banks like Uncle Phil nigga word
Word fuck these bitches get a bird serve
Whoever got it never splurge splurge
Cause when the money going that's when all the honeys rolling
They gone kick you to the curve

[Outro: Meek Mill]
One time for Lil' Snupe R.I.P
Whole squad on that real shit
And you know I was always taught
If them niggas ain't feeding you how you going to ride for them
I was in that position
Loyalty before royalty
I tell my niggas stay down stay close to that money nigga we gon' ball forever

So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

[Verse]
The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake] ×9
Could it be the way that I'll catch up[Hook]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 1]
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

[Hook]

[Outro]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wriYea
Chip, check it out
25 wives
Wish I could have...
If I could have 25 wives..

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Just me with all y'all, that'd be so wonderful
Make daddy proud: I love every one of you
My angels - I feel like Flava Flav but sexier
The sex is gonna be messier
But ain't gonna be no stress in here
We living good all of us, we winning, that's obvious
We got whips, Cars R Us, we smoke good: it's foggy
Plus the status: they all mad at us
Teamwork: that's our recipe for living lavish
Yeah, we get this cabbage
I'm the head coach of the team
If everybody play their position, we can win this thing
Called life, happiness, liberty, freedom
If I got all y'all, there won't be no sense in cheating
Y'all the truth, got a connection with you all
Ambisexuals. If this ain't Heaven what's it called?
Must be life. No greater feeling in the world
If I had 25 wives, I would love all my girls..

[Hook] x2
I wish I could have 25 wives
We'd all get it poppin, we'd all get high: that's fly
If I could have 25 wives
I'd love them all like they love me
We hustle to survive

[Verse 2: Wale]
Got women in every city. Winning in every city
Her body's been paranormal since buying that pair of titties, look
Silicone bitches got the confidence
But natural bitches get all my compliments
I ain't trying to conflict: Nickels to dimes and shit
Make something out of nothing. Nigga, I MacGyver that bitch
Niggas wild as shit. No rubber, just climb in that bitch
Take your hat off and get to cuttin: Kung Lao on that bitch
Mortal Kombat, my shit is beyond rap
I keep it 100 nigga: Warren Moon, Warren Sapp
Hit, I never call her back. Bet she keep on coming back
You keeping her dry, shit, I named that bitch "Tsunami Cat"
I'm too polished, I ain't looking for acknowledgement
Put my squad on my back like I'm wearing me a starter jacket
Yall lame niggas. No bitches when yall are out
I get that Ivy League brain, catch me with a Dartmouth

[Hook] x2

[Outro: Wale]
It's Double M-G yo
It's nothing but a motherfucking undefended free throw
I'm getting each ho
Eyes lower than Ichiro[INTRO: TEY BOOGIE]

I'LL ADMIT IT, I'LL ADMIT IT
I'M NOT LYING BOY I DID IT

[VERSE 1: TEY BOOGIE]
STOP PLAYIN' WITH EM TEY
YOU WAS ON THE SAME BLOCK THEY WAS MOVIN' CAINE

ADD A ZERO TO IT CAUSE WE NEVER TOOK A LOSE
MY SQUAD TO SICK, WE DON'T TAKE NO SHIT
RUN UP ON ME THEY GOING TO MAKE THE SEMI SPIT
EVER TRY ME KNOW I KEEP IT BY THE HIP
I'M FROM A DARK PLACE WHERE YOU VOW NOT TO SLIP
I'M FROM A MEAN PART WHERE YOU GOT TO MOVE A ZIP
YOUR BABY NEED FOOD SO YOU GOT TO MAKE A HIT
NIGGAS MOVING HARD, SEE A COP BETTER SPLIT
YOUR BOYS AIN'T GOT NO HEART SO YOU STUCK WITH A BID
25 TO LIFE TRYING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT
YOUR PAST SO BLACK SO YOU WENT TO MOVING WHITE
RIDIN' IN NEW THINGS, FLOSSIN' WITH NEW BLING
BUT WHEN THE SHIT END, BOY YOU BETTER THINK TWICE
I'M GETTIN' LONGWINDED LET ME FINISH MY SENTENCE
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SO YOU KNOW I'M BACK IN IT
RESURRECT THE FLOW FROM THE STREETS I ROSE
THE BITCH BOYS ALWAYS TALKING BOUT GETTIN' CHOSE
ALI WITH THE PUNCH NO SUBLIMINAL
CAUSE IF YOU WANT IT BITCH BOY I'LL FINISH YOU
THE CHICK THAT YOU WITH AIN'T REALLY FEELING YOU
I SIP TEA AND LET YOU DO WHATEVER YOU DO

MAN YOU DON'T SAY SHIT
804, GOT THE CROWN I RUN SHIT

[OUTRO: TEY BOOGIE]
804 GOD
I JUST GO WITH IT I'M THE FLOW GOD
THEY FUCK WITH ME CAUSE THEY KNOW MY FLOW HARD
BUT MY CITY ON THE MAP, I'M THE 4 GOD[Hook: Drake]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things, have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles
Yeah, ok, they say that I'm the one, in fact
Some say that I'm their favourite
But I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar, where the fuck is Stunna at?
Damn

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Untouchable 40 with my AK
Mastermind, big money heavy weight
On the grind, flipping money in every way
Headline, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white Don P, Marc Jacobs gloves
Cartier Louis case with a dope plod
From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, you know you paid when you got Baby with ya
It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I’m a lady twister I kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit - blisters
Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’ll clueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers
If y'all in the building then we are intruders
Simmer down pimpin', let me handle this
I know the game - analyst
Man I’m the shit, And y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras[Intro]
Yeah
This on some "old Tommy Campos Dice Raw” shit
For my niggas, though

[Verse 1]
You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being frank with you
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with you?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga who's time is comin'
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eating like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill
Boy we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my wheels
Anything happen to pop then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for ten
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
Man, what's up?

[Outro]
Yeah
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty
Aww yeah[Produced by Boi-1da and SykSense]

[Intro]
Rrrr Ting

[Verse]
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy, get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy
Black Benz on the road, boy, already had a Rolls Royce
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad, boy
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing
I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right nowY'all was scared to admit it!

(INDIGO!)

[Verse]
I'm not a typical nigga
Rapping on a beat for the typical niggas
It's like everybody here never seeing the picture
Spittin' mediocre bars so I'm not fuckin' with ya
I don't wanna explain it
Praising the ignoramus
For this picture I painted
Will be one the greatest
Bet you any kind of money anybody complaining
Are the ones with my next mixtape steady playing
Hear the words wotds that  I'm saying
Hear the words that I'm speaking
Weird foing in, can't afford to be tweaking
FuckTypical, fuck nigga, I got me a reason
To be different and apathetic, the logic I'm teaching
Getting rid of my demons
I bury each of 'em alive in the cement
So they can see the type struggles I live
Coming from the evils they was oh so proud to give
Hear the gunshots that had put all the kids in fear
Taste the fuckin' dirt that was talked for many years
Fuck Claritin, I already see clear
Extraordinary, what the fuck is he doing here
Born a visionary with a dictionary
Brutally honest but necessary when the beat is ready
Album be dropping in January, maybe Febuary
If the game not in a cemetery, thta be too scary
Flow too scary
Flow too scary
I'm going back to old one cuz this one's kinda fuckin' ordinary
But who said a nigga was finished
This that Pro Era, Ratt Pack, Indigo, SAVEMONEY, Black Hippy, Royalty
Nigga try to fuck with me
I'ma be the best so everybody can fucking be
So everybody can fucking see
The next generation they was ready to meet
Steady mad cuz they can't see ahead
But their logic is dead, cuz of shit that was read
Cuz of shit that was said
I know you heard things
I know you're hurting
I know you're hurting
Cuz of shit that was said, Iknow you jeard things
But I don't give two fucks
No fucks given
I'm just tryna live the fucking life I was given
FuckTypical, real shit that I'm spittin'
Revolutionary, you can call me John Lennon
Better fucking yet, call a nigga Bruce Willis
Yippie kay yyay, dying hard the buisness
Indigo Squad muthafucka, wwe past the limit
Sophomoric flow, it's kinda fucin' gimmick
Gone![Verse]
Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's urkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love itThese are my one St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, "I guess it does" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup
Noel That’s it Ahhhhhh[Hook – Luu Breeze]
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it troubles me so
All I know is that I’m stuck on this road
Of success so I got to get mine
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it troubles me so
All I know All I know

[Verse 1]
Red phantom, they say I look like Josh Smith from Atlanta
I do, hachoo, excuse you, that nigga look like me
He from the G.A., and I'm M easy, that's Game
I don't do what you niggas do, that's lame
I Soo Woo with my crew from the from the Bird Gang
I Soo Woo with my crew, from under Young Wayne
A walkin' motherfuckin' flame
Livin' up to my brothers name
Rockin' that red shit, wasn't fuckin' with them other gangs
Most other gang's, they wasn't fuckin' with me
Ain't your average motherfucker, I'm a motherfuckin' G
I got some shit on my chest that I want to get off
I got some shit for that vest that will knock that bullshit off
Money like Madoff, Kill em like Adolf, Roy Halladay
I’ll let a fuckin' K off, and I don’t take a fucking day off…

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cincinnati C hat, Boston B hat, them is me hats to Philadelphia P hats
Believe that; bring it to the hood so you can see that
Dumb ass niggas like game, Where the keys at?
Automatic start, nigga where the trees at?
Red boned bitch like Alisha, where the keys at?
Freeze that, like a fucking picture
If you ain’t a blood I ain’t fucking with ya na im just fucking with ya
Stay on my hood shit, hop in the bucket with ya
Throw the ski masks on and get to straight fucking with ya
Ain’t that some shit, that bastards sick
You wana know how I’m livin’ nigga ask your bitch

I came in her mouth ask her lips, you know why?
Coz I had to go past them lips, Trick
You probably paid for those ass and tits for…

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck with the blood clock, smile for my mug shot
Can’t go out like em but I love Big, I love Pac
Love Fab, love Kiss that’s where the love stops
Coz I sleep with the enemy and I hug blocks
Birthed me in the drug spot, nigga with a attitude
Searching me and it's
Fuck cops, nigga pay your gratitude
Before you say I’m acting rude
Understand I’m tryna feed my people
Hati just like Compton the way I’m packing food
But I will act a fool, put cheese on your head
Motherfucker I will Green Bay Packer you
Have a whole football team of niggas after you
Like the punt return, when will you fucking learn
Now take your ass back to school
Wait till 3-o-clock click clack at you
And fuck with your conscience like back packers do
And I ain’t Talib, Black Thought or Mos Def
But I’ve seen the most deaths
And nigga I'm just telling you[Verse 1: Drake]
I said tell me what's really goin' on
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a mothafuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got 'em right?) Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ's got my credit cards and a lotta ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call the King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin' basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everythin'
And Drake just stands for Do Right and Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl I'm fuckin' serious I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin' cause it's on

[Hook: Drake]
You should come with me
If you got some time this is where you wanna be
We can go all night long
This can last all night
Bet it's goin' down, we gon make it right
This is what they mean when they talk about the life
We can go all night long
This can last all night
I'm with if you with it

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Tell them open up the doors, they gotta let us in
It's rap oldest rookie and it's youngest veteran
Go get us Sprite its for the drink, back together bitch
Mr. Doin' It doin' it, what could be better bitch
The dynamic duo, a two man dream team
My pockets stay swollen, call me Mr. Cream Jean
Rocking white diamonds, that vanilla cream bling
They got the game locked down, call it sing sing
You cats straight down in Houston, me proper dos
In a corner booth chilling with some proper hoes
I hit Toronto girls, hold me for ransom
Til I let 'em buy me Polo or they throw me ransom
Damn son, it's like the best of both worlds
That's your wifey and your side, ya getting the best of both girls
So I'mma go ahead and leave the clock running
I ain't finna stop going, you ain't finna stop coming
When the head boy banging, it's like the Funky Drummer drumming
I go right to left and left to right, back to forth, it's nothing
This is something for the gangstas, something for the riders
With a pistol and the money and boppa right beside us
We highly flammable, you better not ignite us
You suffering from put one in the pussy nigga ride us
Goddamn we killing it, ya kids gon' have to hide us
So if you ain't coming with us then you gon' have to write us
Cause it's on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ooh shit, mothafucka, goddamn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money everyday: I'm a groundhog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ugh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin' I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talkin', shut the fuck up, ho
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zoe?
Weezy F Baby and the "F" is for Front door
Cause that's where I bring it, Soo Woo if you bangin', muthafucka

[Hook][Verse 1]
What if rap never worked for me
I can’t say I never thought about it
Planning for a rainy day and its partly cloudy
Not going back to the gutter I will not allow it
I got dirt on my hands my mamas not the proudest
I never dance with the devil couple close encounters
I could rapper about a Bentley and a yacht in Maui
But I’m really in the trap strapped like the Saudi
In the crown vick not a Audi
Not black card neither my credit lousy
College trap nigga outreach I can’t imagine what they’ll do without me
Me, I’m ready for war, as long as I’m here
I’ma give it my all
And I can’t win it if I’m afraid of a loss
No I’m not perfect I’m perfectly flawed

Hook:
And It’s all on me, it’s all on me
Yeah it’s all on me, it’s all on me
’cause I got a fam and they all gotta eat
And if I don’t make it work then we all in the streets so
It’s all on me, it’s all on me
Shit it’s all on me, it’s all on me
’cause I got seads and they got needs
I’m on my feet ant a damn thing free
So it’s all on me, it’s all on me

[Verse 2]
Until the wheels break off
We ain’t at the top till all the bills paid off
Hoping that this fucking record deal pays off
Coming from my cut like I steal chain saw
Trap like a real cage dog
Nine phone lines god still ain’t call
Holding my heart shit still ain’t thawed
Got a book full of problems tryin to deal with em all
And no I don’t advise you to get involved
For the record I am not even a little Biggie Smalls
Taste my own medicine I heal from the scars
I’m just waiting to this pill to dissolve
Me I’m ready for war an as long as I'm here
I’ma give it my all and I can’t win if I’m afraid of a loss
No I’m not perfect, I’m perfectly flawed

Hook:
And It’s all on me, it’s all on me
Yeah it’s all on me, it’s all on me
’cause I got a fam and they all gotta eat
And if I don’t make it work then we all in the streets so
It’s all on me, it’s all on me
Shit it’s all on me, it’s all on me
’cause I got seads and they got needs
I’m on my feet ant a damn thing free
So it’s all on me, it’s all on me

[Verse 3]
Glad you entertained by my bruises
As if my life is for your amusement
I call it pain, Y'all call it music
It don’t matter to you long, as long as I produce hits
And what do I tell Jaylin if I shoot an miss
Hot well daddy I done been used to bricks
From chuckin done green the 106
And I can fall back to the bottom just as quick
The word rest is in the dictionary next to quit
And if I quit even I would think less of Chris
Waking up taking my pistol with me just to piss
Preparing for that unexpected shit
Me, I’m ready for war, as long as I’m here
I’ma give it my all
And I can’t win it if I’m afraid of a loss
No I’m not perfect I’m perfectly flawed

Hook:
And It’s all on me, it’s all on me
Yeah it’s all on me, it’s all on me

And if I don’t make it work then we all in the streets so
It’s all on me, it’s all on me
Shit it’s all on me, it’s all on me
’cause I got seads and they got needs
I’m on my feet ant a damn thing free
So it’s all on me, it’s all on me[Produced by Allen Ritter, Boi-1da & Vinylz]

[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent (in tents)
Then I just sit back and decipher (decide-for) what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, yes, I suppose

[Hook]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me, niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little (Guardian) angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

[Hook]

[Ciara]
Damn, running with romance
And now my heart is beating so fast
And I've been dreaming 'bout this feeling for so long
Man, ever since you came in my life
My stars aligned, you spent the time
It feels so right, I know this can't be wrong

I cry happy, happy tears every night

Just lovin' on you, kissing' on you, being on you
Holding on you, touching on you, leaning on you

What do you do if you a rebel
When the whole world around you ain't thinking on your level
Like a stone to a pebble I'm looking at my bezel
I ain't got time to verbally wrestle with you devils
Talking shit and freeze my mind
Till I become a walking stick to lead the blind, yeah
Do you believe my grind?
I spit polished, that's the reason I perceive to shine
Should've knew from "Session One" leave them guys alone
Feel my work is never done, my life's a song
Even though I kept a gun I knew right from wrong
I got wisdom like Reverend Run, I could wise your dome
I put on for my city, got my hood on smash
Riding through Long Beach, foot on gas
TMZ with the pistols, looking for guns to put on blast
Leave me alone and they staying in my good old stash
The hood mess with my scruples
I looked death in the face so closely I saw myself in his pupils
Everybody got a coffin they gone get in time
I'm walking, not running trying to get in mine
My young homies, they'll thug with a cause
My old homies living life behind government walls
Fell victim to Republican laws
Barbara Boxer, Arnold Schwarzenegger, naw I ain't fucking with y'all
The conspiracy theorist that y'all say I be
Thinking a free clinic giving out H-I-V, ugh
Murder the ghetto with A-I-D-S
Preach to the choir, may I please? Chuch
I know you lyric critics wanna give me hell
Just to harming them flow going deeper than any well
Thinking optimistic, 2013 Coupe on reserve
My ward ain't ending in 2012
I'm the best, hating on me's what you better do
Have to talk behind my back cause I'm ahead of you
Hip Hop Weekly new beat killing 'em
Trying to be a synonym to Kool G
And ill as Eminem with the loose leaf
Crazy as Kool Keith, giving them groupies a two drink minimum
When they suck me off, they be working so hard
Like an employee I must be boss, ugh
My little nigga Manny 15 keep a M16
Love to hear that bitch scream
I can tell him to kill you if I wanted to
But why would I tell him to do something I wanna do

Turn on the TV, rappers all sagging
Tell you ain't never had shit, how y'all bragging? Yeah
Nigga 44 Magnum, point it at you industry niggas who false flagging
You false flagging homie, you false flagging
You false flagging homie, you false flagging
You ain't a Crip, Piru or a Blood
And I hope some real bangers kill you, nigga what?[Produced by Boi-1da and Vinylz]

[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done

I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team till Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

[Hook: Drake]

Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Motherfuck award shows and motherfuck the press like that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Motherfuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw motherfuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

Don't come at me with that wack bullshit
You don't what I'm capable of you little bitch
Doggin' these careers, gotta keep em on a leash
They be froggin' they careers, hippity hop and then they leave

We stay movin', while y'all be watchin'
We stay on the top, while y'all be on the bottom
Just believe me, believe me
