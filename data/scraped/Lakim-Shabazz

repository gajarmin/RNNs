[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
Silly weak rappers are full of this
Since I'm a Don I'm puttin' out a hit
Cause I'm fired up, I'm tired of all the bullshit
Flavor Unit, it's time to attack a prey
So make way for hip-hop's green beret
Bring on the refills, you see we feel
The name of the brain game is kill or be killed
I'm an expert, who will be the next jerk to try?
Let me explain you got 8 million ways to die
We torch and scorch you, make you feel real sore
Have that ass looking just like the spook who sat by the door
Known to kill ducks, skills erupt
You ask why? My reply is 'I don't give a fuck!'
I'm a Panther, I love fresh meat
After I kill you, I'm a leave your body across 110th Street
My tactics are drastic and real fast
I tie a rope to a truck and cold drag your ass
I'm more than a threat, I'm a problem
To hell with cotton, watch out when I come to Harlem
So don't whisper or make a sound or croak
Shit your pop, go straight back down ya throat
Everyday all day this be the hard way
Putting rappers out of commission even on an off day
Flavor Unit rules G, we're taking rappers out
1 motherfucking 2 motherfucking 3

Chorus (x3)

[Verse 2: Apache]
Here comes trouble and it's all that, in fact contact
You're next of kin, friend, follow the flow format
While you slip, I grips so expect to get bruised
Ask me if I give a fuck cos I ain't got shit to lose
Fuck around, lay around and get stuck up
You beat me? Wait a minute, hold the fuck up!
If I was deaf, dumb, blind, stupid, lame
Handicapped, crippled and "pussy" was my middle name
You couldn't beat me slick, snap that neck like a Chick-O-Stick
I know who'll getcha quick. (Who?) My dick!
Tell me, is this some type of tournament?
I cut ya fuckin' head off and use it as a Christmas tree ornament
Come and give me a test whoever claims to be the best
Leaves with a 40-below footprint on his chest
Fucked up, got stuck, go press your luck
Both of his legs were found in back of a garbage truck
Head found in the bar of a limousine
The rest of his body at a dump-site in Queens
Damn man, Mr. Handman, you like braggin
Ya fucked up, made a wrong turn and entered the dragon
I told you I'm out to stalk
Last nigga tried me, died G, felt my tomahawk
Apache, that's me, I'm gettin rappers' ass
1 motherfuckin 2 motherfuckin 3

Chorus (x4)

[Verse 3: Treach]
You coulda been my main shit but you scrap and will wack, black
The only thing I smoke witta pipe is an ass crack
You challenge Treach, I'll seal you quick, you can't touch that
I thought you did a triple cos you said "Aw, fuck that!"
Diamond Hill how ya feel, *?hey Ben Hef?*
Give me a hearin aid or two then I'm thru cos I'm that def
That's how we all be, tighter than small leaves
Club rappin all be, I'm wreckin on all 3
This drill means chill, Guard Ya Grill, trouble
Is that your head or is your neck blowin a fuckin bubble?
A-B-C, skip to the S-T
U-V-W-X, fuck the Y-Z
Brand new, Brand Nubian, Grand Puba-in
Tape dem and cruise me then, if I'm wrong, sue me then
Wait let me hear another tune, tune me in
So I'm straight, if I hear "drop the bomb" I have to go
Break this nig' for anytime or any day, as many rhymes are played
Erase, forgive me not cos shit I'm hot, if I can get then you'll get got
Au contraire, mon frere, this is all my hair
I wouldn't cut it for the biggest butt-ocks out there
Put on a tip or hittin hips, I'm more than quick
I Grease my Lightnin', it's frightening how I get, a slick
Schooled, dark, cool Sagittarian
Two types of marryin: very thick or very thin
Naughty By Nature and the Flavor U-N-I-T
1 motherfuckin 2 motherfuckin 3

Chorus (x4)Feast your eyes, surprise, I got you locked in
The beat is droppin and Lakim's rockin
A lyrical landslide, my status is strong form
My days of rhymin old school are long gone
You better watch it when I get to the vital stage
Rhymes'll come crashin down like a tidal wave
You ( ? ) path of destruction, it caused an eruption
Cause Lakim was lustin
For a low-down, low-life lame brain with the same
Gameplan, I can't stand cause it's too plain
You need to slow your roll and switch your pitch
It's time for Lak to rip, so prepare for this
I'm cool and smooth, this is what Lak means
Rhymes are sometimes referred to as whipped cream
Give me a def kick, give me a hype snare
Mark give me a high-hat for those that bite, here
's a chunk of funk for you to nibble on
This is a rain rap shower, so I'mma drizzle on
Those who chose to oppose the way the Lak flows
Cause only those with the given gift knows
You gotta be nice, real hard, real hype
Have the real type of lyrics to present to the crowd
But when it's time to flow they will all know
That Lak Shabazz is black and I'm proud

I'm black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proudPut negativity to a halt, it's not my fault that we're killin
And illin, that's why I'm takin my time and I'm spillin
My guts on a cut like this one
Make sure you don't miss none
Of the rhymes from the clean and crisp one
People of the planet Earth, man, it hurts to see
People livin in poverty, there's got to be a better way to live
We gotta learn to give more love, that's the only alternative
Just the other day I was speakin to my man Rob
And I said, "Yo Rob, what's up hops?"
He said, "Lak man, I just can't stand
And I don't understand the ignorance of a blackman
Too many crackheads, tackheads and bloodshed
Brothers and sisters are fightin instead of unitin
We need to cut it out, we're self-destructin
You know what we need, Lak?" "What Rob?" "We need more lovin"

(Gotta get some lovin)

We're self-destructin
That's why we gotta get more lovin

Love the fact that you're black if you are black
Beamin up to Scotty is wack, this ain't Star Trek
Be not weak but be strong and watch out for the attack
Of those that might try to hold ya back
I'm the type of guy that likes to spread peace
Not the type of guy that'll leave your achy
You've been sleeping too long, you need your bed reached
Wake up before you end up a dead sheep
Innocent till proven guilty, yeah, that makes sense
The blacks, we're guilty till we're proven innocent
To get where I got to my approach was different
Now you know why I'm so militant
I got a handful of love, yeah, take a crunch
But be positive, you come negative, you get punched
One bad apple don't spoil a whole bunch
We can make it - get my hunch?
Stop your snakeous mischievin, your lyin and thievin
And love the fact that you're alive and breathin
Love is the key, see, to unity, without it there's nothin
So let's all show a little more lovin

Break it down like this

Love could be the start of many things
We all know the sorrow and joy it brings
Set your goals in life and believe in your dreams
And maybe one day it might come true, yo, know what I mean?
Stop complainin, we need to crack down
I heard of Chinatown but never of Blacktown
By any means necessary I'm not havin it
Anymore we need our own establishments
People of the world, it's plain to see
We need to spread a little more l-o-v-e
Nothin in the world is gonna come to you free
So let's get work together and make money
Some of us are so blind we don't understand, see
We're jealous and envious and wonder why can't we
Live in unity as one big family
I show a lot of love for those that are down with me
And we'll hold on through thick and thin
Cause we're brothers and sisters, more than just friends
Destroy negative and build the positive
Do what you wanna do, that's your prerogative
Stick together, no matter the weather
Let no one stop ya, I'm sure you can prosper
We need to cut it out, we're self-destructin
Play ya part, open your heart and spread some lovin(Malcolm X sampled)
Concerning the difference between the Black revolution and the Negro revolution

[Lakim Shabazz]
Well, I’m Black - the dominant shade, I'm an upgrade
A hip-hop musician, so listen as I get paid
Cee Just rips the cut with the dope stuff
Can the 45 King Sample a Dope Noise?
Sho’ ‘nuff!
I know the ledge, over the edge I won’t fall
This rhyme was designed for the Final Call
We got to struggle and fight, against apartheid
Who are these people telling us when the living die?
I’m sorry to say, but one day, we are gonna die
I don’t know about you, but I’m here, and I’m gonna try
To make the Black man understand that we can
Get the Qur’an back in our hands in the Motherland
You say it’s gonna be hard, but I’m god, I got the proof and truth
And now it’s time to get loose
Spread my Wisdom, educate the people
Forget these Divine-Evils
Just leave them
The Hell alone
Pick up your telephone
Dial some positive brothers so they can join in
And come along
Peace unleashed upon Minister Farrakhan
For preachin’ and teachin’ the truth
To the deaf-and-blind
With negative brothers, you know Shabazz don’t bother
Most brothers strive, but I strive harder
These are Actual Facts, the dominant Black, I’m Right and Exact
I came to tell you my brother
Black is back

(Concerning the difference…)

Black is back!

See, I’m real, rougher
I had enough a’
You poppin’ off at the mouth, so Midas-ize that muffler
The hype, I don’t believe the white
I do conceive, imagine
While you’re gaggin’, smoking’ weed
Black man from Asia, I will amaze the
Crowd, kick it loud boy, this is not a deja
Vu
Who in the world is gonna stop me?
You, you souped-up sucker? You slip and you’re sloppy
Rhymes are retarded, separated, departed
From real to unreal - don’t get me started
‘Cause once I start unleashing my talents
People take a vote - so place your ballots
Nine times out of ten, the god will win
Hear some boos - I lose to you, tell me how you’re livin’?
You must be livin’ like a snake in the grass
My name is La, I’m descended from the Tribe of Shabazz
I am original, critical, you wanna hear a lyrical
Menace, when it’s battle, go against me? I pity the fool
‘Cause fools are those who oppose the right way
The rules are chose, don’t go, nobody knows, I might stay
Here to endear, persevere with my skill
I'll drill with science of self inside your head
And then I’ll build a strong foundation
Now tell me if I lack
I came to tell you, my brother -
Black is back!

(Concerning the difference…)[ Lakim ]
Yo, peace Tasheen
[ Tasheen ]
Peace Lakim
[ Lakim ]
Yo, what's the science, my brother?
[ Tasheen ]
Yo, these brothers gotta start puttin their wisdom in action
To show and prove that they are brothers in action
[ Lakim ]
Yo, let's show and prove it to em

[ Tasheen ]
Peace Lord, all applaud, the Almighty's in action
Flauntin the gift by rippin a style that's fashioned
Strong in my spot, lyrics locked like a bolt
Extensions, sentences season the mic like salt
( ? ) flavor, hungry cause I crave a
Beat to feast on, so Lakim gave a
Opportunity for you to see a God-given gift
My knowledge of self, so I have to uplift
The weak and blind, teach the people of my kind
The truth is light and only sunlight shines
Rays and radiation illimunate a nation
I Self Lord Master, here for generations
Because of the lifeforce, a source of power
Knowledge is facts, wisdom's a shower
Of words spoken wisely showin understandin
Too many people are blind, so the god put a hand in
Our project with dope styles that are complex
Lak's next to flex on this type of text
Let's cast a hex, I mark the spot x
Lay low and flow as I go I just flex
Computate a fraction, my people are askin
For guidance, I'm ridin not slidin, my traction
Is grippin, not slippin, my rhyme style's rippin
And I'm a brother in action

[ Lakim ]
See, I belong to the righteous and I'm in action
Observe me, I'm packin
Deadly poems is what I hit you with
Affecting those who oppose like barbiturates
My mind's the ( ? ), body's the Asia
I got 120 ways to righteously raise ya
I stand in a square of four equivalent sides, equalin 90
Add em up, what did you find, bee?
Not a lame brain lad whistling Dixie
But a cipher of complete 360
Usin 23 million miles of useful land
To show and prove I'm the original man
Tricknology's a game the devil plays
He fooled us before, but no, not nowadays
Columbus discovered the poor part of the planet Earth
He didn't care, he preserved the best part for himself
To build and add on, don't try and play dumb
I'm also the brother that'll take life away from
You and whoever should never
Mess around with Islam, you're not that clever
Cause that ain't a finnegan begin again
From the beginning to the ending
I'm hyper than a hallucinogen
So observe me, knowledge the traction
See, I'm a righteous brother who's in action

[ Lakim ]
Tasheen, my brother
This is the knowledge born born cipher, yeah
And far as I can see
Allah's nation is definitely puttin that wisdom in motion and action
Cause we got the magnetic attraction
And we are definitely in effect
My name is Lakim Shabazz Allah
Sendin peace to all the gods and earths in the whole entire universe
Uknowmsayin?
Cause we definitely puttin that wisdom in motion
And we outta here, peace

[ Tasheen ]
Peace, this is the Almighty Tasheen Allah
Sending a shout-out to all the gods in the universe
And to the CDP Posse
And we outta here

[ Lakim ]
Peace
[ Tasheen ]
Peace
[ repeated ](Our people will survive America)

[ VERSE 1 ]
My people were took from the motherland
By the other man
Brought to the wilderness
Like a ventriloquist
Played my people like puppets by plantin fear in their heart
Nowadays most of us don't know where to start
10% of us can help, but don't feel the need
They love greed
And this really bothers me
85% of us are totally ignorant
Walkin around with the nigger ment-
Ality, 5% of us are ready to die for
The cause, of course the source is Elijah
Knowledge of self is what you need to stop the bull
If you don't get it, I'm held responsible
Rhymes I make are designed to reach the youth
I gotta teach, that's why I speak the truth
Some waste time dwellin on the past
It's time they know that we're the lost Tribe of Shabazz

(Our people will survive America)	(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Stay awake and don't sleep, cause I'm comin after ya
Devils I smash and leave em flat as a spatula
Back again, the mathmatical radical
Gettin emotional, very emphatical
The original man uses 23 million
Square miles on the planet Earth, constantly buildin
On the other hand the other man wants to confuse ya
Simple psychology, tricknowlogy fools ya
They have you believe we descend from cannibals
Show you pictures of Africans lookin like animals
How could we be animals, look at the things we did
With our own bare hands we built pyramids
Blind, deaf, and dumb is how they raised ya
To them it's Africa, to us it's Asia
To get to the point, to make it clear to ya
They're no superior, and we're not inferior
I got the other man pointin at me, cause I licked him
Took a stand for the blackman, and didn't fall victim
The nation is growin rapid and fast
That's why I'm tellin you we're the lost Tribe of Shabazz

(Our people will survive America)	(4x)

[ VERSE 3 ]
I couldn't wait to battle a beat like this track
Is so def, I had to pump my fist, black
My rhymes weigh six sextillion tons
Heavy as the Earth, a lyrical function
Imagine if every black man, woman and child
Would simply refuse
To go to work for one day
Do you know how much money these companies would lose?
Since everything's based on money, that's what we gotta get
We gotta learn when to quit, when not to quit
It's really sad, I know some people
Think that one day we'll be treated as equal
It's the Land of the Freedom, or so they say so
They tell you're free, yeah, but free to do what though?
Off our arms and legs they took the chains
Big deal - they still left em around our brains
Things I say make the government fear this
I speak with authority, so you can hear this
I hate oreos, that's why I gots to bomb
You so-called niggerish Uncle Toms
We're on a rise-up, you better wise up
You can't stop us, now are you surprised, duck?
You might take it as a political outblast
But we're the lost Tribe of Shabazz

(Our people will survive America)	(8x)Time to jam, I got a quarter grand ready to splurge
Suddenly I got the urge to watch some bodyslam
Ready to go clubs-hoppin, my pockets
Full of money and I'm feelin real funny
( ? ) figure eights in the place cold stun me
Then I got approached by this light skinned honey
Said, "Don't look surprised, see, I know who you are
Let's separate here and have a drink at the bar
My name's Sexy Betsy, you are a rap star
You got it goin on, I think you're gonna go real far"
Tried to flatter me, said my lips look sweet
And juicy, "and I bet it takes like a peach
What do you think?" I said, "Sex on the Beach"
A few more looks, I had her hooked like a leech
Five minutes we hung out, honey girl strung out
Now I coulda took honey girl home without a doubt
She start to stare, run my fingers all through her hair
You know what happened? A ( ? ) came out
I was surprised, didn't wanna believe
That my hand had to feel honey girl's hair weave
So I chilled, I didn't get ill or rowdy
Said, "See ya baby, I'm Audi like gowdy"
Thought it was real but it was fake, see, I was blind
You never know what you find
Dealin with

[ Chorus ]
(Ladies)
Got to have you lady, you sexy baby
(Ladies)
Bamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me
(Ladies)
Yes, I'm speakin to the fly women of the world
Peep it out
(Ladies)
Gimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls

I like ladies that's light skinned, brown skinned
The tone of skin to me makes no difference
I don't understand why some brothers frown
When they're approached by a woman who's dark or brown skinned
Some light skinned women think they're too good
Stay in the mirror all day and they think that they should
Find a man who's much more darker than them
Why choose your man by the color of skin?
I don't front, I tell straight facts
What I say has a very strong impact
I want you to know the eight shades of yellow
Eight shades of brown and it equals 16 shades of black
You need to wise up, cut out the bull crap
Whoever told you that need to be slapped
I don't smoke dust, not on a pipe or crack
The color of your skin to me doesn't mean jack
Because I know the right way to angle you
Most women are swift and changeable
Listen up laides, see, I got a thing for you
So now I'ma ( ? ) a few
Because I think it's bout time I let you know
I'm into women, but I'm not a superhoe
They're so mysterious, there's somethin about em
You can't live em and I can't live without em

[ Chorus ]

Break it down

( *sax solo* )

Get on the dancefloor, make sure you don't trip
Don't front now, I see you're pluckin those lips
Get a grip on a groove and don't slip
Shake it all around and roll your hips
Hourglass bodies that look sexy sassy
I'm the type that won't let a honey pass me
I'm not a dog, my name's not Lassie
Every once in a while I feel kinda nasty
Cool and calm, composure's kept
But some honeys think I'm only out to get my thing wet
My main goal is to control your soul
On the dancefloor cause like Keith, I'll make you sweat
Because you're so tender
Leavin me breathless, so this message I send ya
They're so mysterious, there's somethin about em
You can't live em and I can't live without

[ Chorus ]

Yeah, uknowmsayin?
This is how I feel about you ladies in the '90s
Cause y'all so sweet and tender
So I had to kick one out for you, yeah
This is Lakim Shabazz in full effect, 1990

Peace La

Yo what is the Knowledge?

Yo, the Knowledge is the foundation of all things in existence as the black man is the foundation to his family

Well, what is the Wisdom?

Yo, the Wisdom is the wise words spoken by the wise person to show and prove God does exist

Well, I hear that both of these are symbolic to 1 and 2. When you add 1 and 2 up what does that equal up to?

Yo that equals up to 3 which is the Understanding

And give me a better phrase for the Understanding so they can understand you

Ok the Understanding's a clear picture that one draws up in the mind of Knowledge and Wisdom, ok, which is perfectly understood by the all-seeing eye which is the mind

Ok brother I can go with that. Well I hear the Understanding is also the child, and I know that we must teach the children what?

Gotta teach them the freedom and the truth

And what is the truth so they may stand in what though?

A square of Pure Righteousness, hmmPeace, my brothers and sisters
How ya been, I kinda missed ya
But now I'm back rockin this club track
Hit your cassettes, I think you better dub this one, black
Cause it's kickin, it's gonna stick in
Your brain, Just goes insane on the mixin
And on the rhyme tip I get mines quick
I don't waste no time, I click
Testin my mic, mic-check
Is it hype yet? It's hype? Aight, bet
Grab a girl and proceed to the floor
This is the perfect night for you to score
Just might be a night for romance
I don't care, all I want you to do is dance
Girls are fiending for loving
Cryin and kissin and huggin
But they don't know nothin
Once the bug's in all of you will start buggin
Ladies listen, I'm not dissin
Don't ( ? ) cause there's too many fish in
The sea for me to do what I wanna do with
And I'm not stupid, so don't play me like cupid
Keep your claps on as I rap on
The title of this song is let's on add

Well, let's start this
I wanna see the crowd get retarted
On the dance scene, know what I mean?
I'm the cream, the cream, the one that rises
And I'm one of the wisest
My fans been waiting so long
For me to come on with a rap to a club song
Well, here it is, just a little taste
So let it pump and ride the bass
Hands start clappin when I'm rappin
Booties are shakin, feet start tappin
The flavor lingers, fingers start snappin
I last long cause I'm strong and I'm black and
Proud, I'ma say it out loud
I'ma sincerely rock this crowd
I got something here you don't ever wanna turn down
So be concerned, clown
Cause if you're not concerned you'll get ( ? ) on
For the simple fact that you slept on
And it's not wise to sleep in this business
Cause you can get dismissed
This is a mixture of club and hip-hop
And I'm on my way like straight to the tip-top
And I don't stop, word is bond
I'm glad to be strong
So let's add on[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
See I'm the all true and living
So take heed to the knowledge that I'm giving
And you will be uprisen upon your highest point of achievement
You will receive this, loud and clear and I mean this
Is a warning or precaution, proceed with caution
I'm so manipulant I'll use distortion
To twist out the normal shape, all natural
I'm right and exact, my facts are actual
I'll make you freeze, seize where you stand man
Lock 'em up and chop 'em up just like Mr Hangman
With negative brothers and suckers yeah I dealt with
I won more championships than the Celtics
Got a feeling for rap the first time I felt this
I got me a pen a paper and a felt tip
And started going to work with rhymes and words
I'm not a joke, a jerk, got no time for nerds
I got the time, a rhyme make money and things
You want a taste of honey, girl, give me a ring
Cause I'm a father, I'll fill you with the cream
Of life, that's right, cause I'm an original being
I'm very militant prepare for the holy-caust
Are you the same, if not, take a total loss
You keep listening you will be uprisen
From a regular slave by the all true and living

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
I'm pushing rhymes of a heavyweight, yours are middleweight
It ain't my fault you came to the party just a little late
You lost your turn to rock, now it's your turn to jock
A real rap professional, burn the block down
Cause I'm a lyrical prophet prophesizing my
Literature which is hardcore and ask if I
Give a damn, my man, about what you want to do
Cause I'mma tell you right now what I'm gonna do
Take 120 ducks, 120 suckers, 120 more blind, deaf and dumb brothers
Fake emcees, wannabes, yeah that's good and plenty of 'em
And I'll demolish all 360 of 'em
The number of blind brothers used to multiply
They were fed the wrong foods, taught loads of lies
Now it's decreasing cause I'm unleashing my knowledge of self
I'm holding my belt and I'm teaching
Those that need to be taught and brought up
Into a square of pure righteousness and get caught up
With the lessons, they're a blessing and keep you from guessing
All praises are due to Allah you get the message
Cause I'm a provider of lyrical torture
I absorb lyrics like a sponge does water
To me knowledge is food like Dig 'Em Smacks
I'm digging, keep listening
See we're all true and livingFeast your eyes, surprise, I got you locked in
The beat is droppin and Lakim's rockin
A lyrical landslide, my status is strong form
My days of rhymin old school are long gone
You better watch it when I get to the vital stage
Rhymes'll come crashin down like a tidal wave
You ( ? ) path of destruction, it caused an eruption
Cause Lakim was lustin
For a low-down, low-life lame brain with the same
Gameplan, I can't stand cause it's too plain
You need to slow your roll and switch your pitch
It's time for Lak to rip, so prepare for this
I'm cool and smooth, this is what Lak means
Rhymes are sometimes referred to as whipped cream
Give me a def kick, give me a hype snare
Mark give me a high-hat for those that bite, here
's a chunk of funk for you to nibble on
This is a rain rap shower, so I'mma drizzle on
Those who chose to oppose the way the Lak flows
Cause only those with the given gift knows
You gotta be nice, real hard, real hype
Have the real type of lyrics to present to the crowd
But when it's time to flow they will all know
That Lak Shabazz is black and I'm proud

I'm black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud(Malcolm X sampled)
Concerning the difference between the Black revolution and the Negro revolution

[Lakim Shabazz]
Well, I’m Black - the dominant shade, I'm an upgrade
A hip-hop musician, so listen as I get paid
Cee Just rips the cut with the dope stuff
Can the 45 King Sample a Dope Noise?
Sho’ ‘nuff!
I know the ledge, over the edge I won’t fall
This rhyme was designed for the Final Call
We got to struggle and fight, against apartheid
Who are these people telling us when the living die?
I’m sorry to say, but one day, we are gonna die
I don’t know about you, but I’m here, and I’m gonna try
To make the Black man understand that we can
Get the Qur’an back in our hands in the Motherland
You say it’s gonna be hard, but I’m god, I got the proof and truth
And now it’s time to get loose
Spread my Wisdom, educate the people
Forget these Divine-Evils
Just leave them
The Hell alone
Pick up your telephone
Dial some positive brothers so they can join in
And come along
Peace unleashed upon Minister Farrakhan
For preachin’ and teachin’ the truth
To the deaf-and-blind
With negative brothers, you know Shabazz don’t bother
Most brothers strive, but I strive harder
These are Actual Facts, the dominant Black, I’m Right and Exact
I came to tell you my brother
Black is back

(Concerning the difference…)

Black is back!

See, I’m real, rougher
I had enough a’
You poppin’ off at the mouth, so Midas-ize that muffler
The hype, I don’t believe the white
I do conceive, imagine
While you’re gaggin’, smoking’ weed
Black man from Asia, I will amaze the
Crowd, kick it loud boy, this is not a deja
Vu
Who in the world is gonna stop me?
You, you souped-up sucker? You slip and you’re sloppy
Rhymes are retarded, separated, departed
From real to unreal - don’t get me started
‘Cause once I start unleashing my talents
People take a vote - so place your ballots
Nine times out of ten, the god will win
Hear some boos - I lose to you, tell me how you’re livin’?
You must be livin’ like a snake in the grass
My name is La, I’m descended from the Tribe of Shabazz
I am original, critical, you wanna hear a lyrical
Menace, when it’s battle, go against me? I pity the fool
‘Cause fools are those who oppose the right way
The rules are chose, don’t go, nobody knows, I might stay
Here to endear, persevere with my skill
I'll drill with science of self inside your head
And then I’ll build a strong foundation
Now tell me if I lack
I came to tell you, my brother -
Black is back!

(Concerning the difference…)[ Lakim ]
Yo, peace Tasheen
[ Tasheen ]
Peace Lakim
[ Lakim ]
Yo, what's the science, my brother?
[ Tasheen ]
Yo, these brothers gotta start puttin their wisdom in action
To show and prove that they are brothers in action
[ Lakim ]
Yo, let's show and prove it to em

[ Tasheen ]
Peace Lord, all applaud, the Almighty's in action
Flauntin the gift by rippin a style that's fashioned
Strong in my spot, lyrics locked like a bolt
Extensions, sentences season the mic like salt
( ? ) flavor, hungry cause I crave a
Beat to feast on, so Lakim gave a
Opportunity for you to see a God-given gift
My knowledge of self, so I have to uplift
The weak and blind, teach the people of my kind
The truth is light and only sunlight shines
Rays and radiation illimunate a nation
I Self Lord Master, here for generations
Because of the lifeforce, a source of power
Knowledge is facts, wisdom's a shower
Of words spoken wisely showin understandin
Too many people are blind, so the god put a hand in
Our project with dope styles that are complex
Lak's next to flex on this type of text
Let's cast a hex, I mark the spot x
Lay low and flow as I go I just flex
Computate a fraction, my people are askin
For guidance, I'm ridin not slidin, my traction
Is grippin, not slippin, my rhyme style's rippin
And I'm a brother in action

[ Lakim ]
See, I belong to the righteous and I'm in action
Observe me, I'm packin
Deadly poems is what I hit you with
Affecting those who oppose like barbiturates
My mind's the ( ? ), body's the Asia
I got 120 ways to righteously raise ya
I stand in a square of four equivalent sides, equalin 90
Add em up, what did you find, bee?
Not a lame brain lad whistling Dixie
But a cipher of complete 360
Usin 23 million miles of useful land
To show and prove I'm the original man
Tricknology's a game the devil plays
He fooled us before, but no, not nowadays
Columbus discovered the poor part of the planet Earth
He didn't care, he preserved the best part for himself
To build and add on, don't try and play dumb
I'm also the brother that'll take life away from
You and whoever should never
Mess around with Islam, you're not that clever
Cause that ain't a finnegan begin again
From the beginning to the ending
I'm hyper than a hallucinogen
So observe me, knowledge the traction
See, I'm a righteous brother who's in action

[ Lakim ]
Tasheen, my brother
This is the knowledge born born cipher, yeah
And far as I can see
Allah's nation is definitely puttin that wisdom in motion and action
Cause we got the magnetic attraction
And we are definitely in effect
My name is Lakim Shabazz Allah
Sendin peace to all the gods and earths in the whole entire universe
Uknowmsayin?
Cause we definitely puttin that wisdom in motion
And we outta here, peace

[ Tasheen ]
Peace, this is the Almighty Tasheen Allah
Sending a shout-out to all the gods in the universe
And to the CDP Posse
And we outta here

[ Lakim ]
Peace
[ Tasheen ]
Peace
[ repeated ]Yo
Everybody in the Flavor Unit is real def
But we're gonna make one record altogether
Who's gonna go first?

[ VERSE 1: Apache ]
Here's another rapper that thought he caught me 'sleep
MC's, you feel frogous - leap
Rhymin dictionaries - on the contrary
Your style's plain, it stays the same, mines vary
From A to Z, just like the alphabet
Find another brother to [fuck] with, cause I'ma get
Angry, then run through the chain of command
The last to stand fled, cause he's a dead man
Egos are bruised, MC's get confused
I filter out the wack, then cruise
Past at a swift pace, let's lace
The rhyme with dope - take a toke, just in case
The song's too strong, take two pulls and pass
Smoke fumes from the mic might make you gasp
For another breath, it's a slow death
Fight, you tried, but you died, now who's left?
Dead on arrival, if you survive you'll
Remember the name, Flavor Unit'll guide you
Apache, that's me, so flee
Stop talkin, I'm a walkin one-man posse
You're steppin on thin ice, flexin smooth and nice
Each cut's precise, here's some advice
A lotta power, it's time to peep the God
Of the Flavor Unit Assassination Squad

[ VERSE 2: Lakim Shabazz ]
There's no need to wonder why you was kept in the dark
Your rhymes are not flowin, they're showin stretchmarks
Who told you we were dead broke?
Thinkin you're choice, and your voice sound like you got a stretched throat
You're just another duck, a certified buttercup
You better duck, I'm throwin lyrical uppercuts
Verses are versatile, I'm worth your while
Put a punk against me, I murder the child
Thinkin of a mystery that gets to me
Playin around sayin you're gonna dis the G
You wish to be, just like me
You wanna battle me? I insist that we
Toss up a coin - head's up, now let's kick off
The Hip-Hop Superbowl, see who'll get picked off
Not me, I'ma win by a mile or two
And make you feel like a molecule
I stand in the square of Pure Righteousness
Your song was dope, but yo, it's not hype as this
They say you live a life of the rich and famous
To me it's the life of the weak and nameless
Rappers get roasted, toasted, barbecued
Lyrics explode then they're blown into particles
Thought you were sly and slick, a clever cat
You take me out? Yo - never that
I'm God, a descendant of Master Fard
The Flavor Unit Assassination Squad

[ VERSE 3: Queen Latifah ]
Make a wish like Aladdin
I'ma step to the mic, you wish you hadn't
Cause I get mad when
You attempt to invade my queendom
Stop dreamin, don't hand me that
I murder, maim, and handicap
A female prevails, start bitin your nails
You're nervous, join the service, I'm hyped as hell
A feminine teacher in the form of Queen Latifah
I hype the mic and pump the speakers
I don't wanna dig too deep, who are you to sleep
On me, the Queen of the Flavor Unit posse
You wanna step? Then step hard
This is the Flavor Unit Assassination Squad

[ VERSE 4: Double J ]
I listen to some riff while the others stand stiff
I'll uplift the gift and have nothin to deal with
You're bull, some get pull from, it hurts my nerve
But I'ma serve, give em what they deserve
They wanna try to act hot like they just won a jackpot
Think they can flow (but no, not by a long shot)
The J without delay here to display
While other rappers decay the Flavor Unit will stay
On the top of the situation
Untouchable concentration leads to elevation
We'll stay untouched with the style that's too much
As the mic gets clutched, such
A dope voice puts fear in your heart through your ear
Listen close, and you'll hear
The Unit coincide as one, outsiders run
You want respect? Forget it, you're gettin none
I'll advise, improvise, teach you learnin
Get respect the old fashion way - we'll earn it
But you execute before I'm through, yo
This is what I'm prepared to do
Rock that ass real fast, the nation's hard
The Flavor Unit Assassination Squad

[ VERSE 5: Lord Alibaski ]
Get swift possession, a lyrical session
A family affair, Alibaski's lettin
Off another dose of words to shank a man
Tenacious, the hip-hop anchorman
Little bit of rep growin and it's dominant
Roll MC's over on my own recognizance
Since the beat in 6/8 causes a swirl
Creating the 8th wonder of the world
It's my turn, so I think I'll flow till
I can make a mountain out of a molehill
The King will let off his beat that's so chill
Release me, so I can go kill
Competitors who work through hours of rain
I'm a notorious lynchman, I got powers of pain
Pure punishment, so run and get
Reserves, so I can serve abundant with
Ship em out to me, cause the dollars are greener
But the first question first, but don't miss the meaning
Are you capable? Spit it out, tell me are you able
Or would you prefer the view from the scorer's table
Razorsharp, hits are bein landed
Played my part, diss, I'm countin heads, and
The dynamic duo of the Flavor, you know
Ready for any- and everybody or who, so
Be it, when my lyrics fill the air
I get hungry, and the mic's my silverware
I bring the crew, you face your doom, I'm large
The Flavor Unit Assassination SquadPut negativity to a halt, it's not my fault that we're killin
And illin, that's why I'm takin my time and I'm spillin
My guts on a cut like this one
Make sure you don't miss none
Of the rhymes from the clean and crisp one
People of the planet Earth, man, it hurts to see
People livin in poverty, there's got to be a better way to live
We gotta learn to give more love, that's the only alternative
Just the other day I was speakin to my man Rob
And I said, "Yo Rob, what's up hops?"
He said, "Lak man, I just can't stand
And I don't understand the ignorance of a blackman
Too many crackheads, tackheads and bloodshed
Brothers and sisters are fightin instead of unitin
We need to cut it out, we're self-destructin
You know what we need, Lak?" "What Rob?" "We need more lovin"

(Gotta get some lovin)

We're self-destructin
That's why we gotta get more lovin

Love the fact that you're black if you are black
Beamin up to Scotty is wack, this ain't Star Trek
Be not weak but be strong and watch out for the attack
Of those that might try to hold ya back
I'm the type of guy that likes to spread peace
Not the type of guy that'll leave your achy
You've been sleeping too long, you need your bed reached
Wake up before you end up a dead sheep
Innocent till proven guilty, yeah, that makes sense
The blacks, we're guilty till we're proven innocent
To get where I got to my approach was different
Now you know why I'm so militant
I got a handful of love, yeah, take a crunch
But be positive, you come negative, you get punched
One bad apple don't spoil a whole bunch
We can make it - get my hunch?
Stop your snakeous mischievin, your lyin and thievin
And love the fact that you're alive and breathin
Love is the key, see, to unity, without it there's nothin
So let's all show a little more lovin

Break it down like this

Love could be the start of many things
We all know the sorrow and joy it brings
Set your goals in life and believe in your dreams
And maybe one day it might come true, yo, know what I mean?
Stop complainin, we need to crack down
I heard of Chinatown but never of Blacktown
By any means necessary I'm not havin it
Anymore we need our own establishments
People of the world, it's plain to see
We need to spread a little more l-o-v-e
Nothin in the world is gonna come to you free
So let's get work together and make money
Some of us are so blind we don't understand, see
We're jealous and envious and wonder why can't we
Live in unity as one big family
I show a lot of love for those that are down with me
And we'll hold on through thick and thin
Cause we're brothers and sisters, more than just friends
Destroy negative and build the positive
Do what you wanna do, that's your prerogative
Stick together, no matter the weather
Let no one stop ya, I'm sure you can prosper
We need to cut it out, we're self-destructin
Play ya part, open your heart and spread some lovin[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
Peace as I unleash
Style of the wild, tell a lyrical masterpiece
Swift as a summer's breeze
The knowledge I possess is power of self and it gives me
The strength to go the length
You're yapping, flapping off at the lid
Cause you must have been sleeping, now you slept
You see you're lost in the sauce boy, did you forget I kept
The beat intact and I'll spark this
It's elevated, created straight from total darkness
I freeze your mental comp, word to herb I can do this
Because my mind is my third eye
I show and prove, the multitude
Is the crowd that I will move
I have to say today you and your boys you're not right for this
I'm raw and rare, I stand in a square of pure righteousness

Righteously pure

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
See I'm pure, clean, I mix with anything
Not contaminated, but reanimated
First I was living the life of a blind one
Now I'm sincere, polite and a kind one
The devil planted fear in my heart, I was just a child
That was long ago
In the meanwhile I'll manipulate 'em, then I'll make 'em
Kneel to the power of God cause I'm hard and I'll take 'em
Through trials and tribulations, miles of aggravation
I'm yearning, I'm determined, my determination
Is strong, I have the will to bill you
Fill you with the cream of life and appeal to
The adolescent crowd who are youngsters
Dump all your wack rhymes into my dumpster
I came to tell you that you are not right for this
I'm raw and rare, I stand in a square of pure righteousness

[Verse 3: Lakim Shabazz]
See I'm righteous, you wonder how I got to this
Think about it, form a hypothesis
An educated guess upon who can manifest
Ejaculate lyrics into the mic at your request
Well it's me, G-O-D
I'm God, my number is 7
I'm def and all those things that coincide with dopeness
It didn't take long to perform and to quote this
A lyrical prophet prophesizing poetry
Why don't you wise up, come on and go with me
Into this realm where I dwell as a king
The brothers follow the path, the wrath of Lakim
I'm your spice of life, my rhymes are nice and tasteful
The stage is a battlefield, that's where I'mma waste you
To be specific, yo I'm terrific
Talented and gifted, you're wondering if it's
A brother being careless, try to compare this
Rhyme to another emcee, your result'll be fatal
Because the God is willing and able
You're like a brand new baby, I rocked your cradle
I'm telling you boy, you ain't right for this
I'm raw and rare, I stand in a square of pure righteousnessSee, what you gotta do is man your battle stations I'm gracin
Contest, start the process of elimination
Make a maneouvre, you move too fast to see
Who's next up? Let's see who's last decree
My strike is fatal, you feel the wrath, you're doomed
Today is gonna be dog day's afternoon
Rappers, I torture, teach em what naughty means
Pick em like coffee beans and show em what 'off me' means
They go against, they never win, they get dock-seated
Lyrics hit you so hard you think you had a shock treatment
Rappers, I pass flash by em like a thunderclap
My mic is a axe, so call me a rappin lumberjack
A terrorizin terror makin no errors
You're a duck, so I'mma pluck all of your feathers
My voice remounts, it's full like a fountain
MC's, I caught em, manslaughter em while I'm countin
They mullah, then I look in they crew's eye
Watch em take a deep breath, then step from the set
Cause my killer instincts will show in deadly ways
Look around, can you count all the heads I laid?
Lak Shabazz, a menace, a real trouble maker
Let it be known that I'm hard, I love to take a
Weak wack rapper and make him look down to me
Because he looks like Bozo the Clown to me
Everything is serious, nothin to smile for
You gotta brace yourself for the style wars

(Ready to go to war - now)
(We are ready to go to war - now)

Well, I'm back to attack, clash of a mic and a titan
I'm fully equipped to rip and totally enlighten
Lyrics are swift and smooth, hit you real, see
When you hear em, you forget all about the beat
Lak's the name, not a game like double dare
MC's get scared or beware because trouble's here
You wanna battle me? Hey look, go for it
Your lyrics are old school, prehistoric
Ancient, corroded and busted
Greasy and dirty and full of combustion
What a flop, what a pity, what a waste of time
You want def rhymes? Here's a taste of mine
Lyrics I write contain a hard, def style
Yours are soft and moist, made out of textile
( ? ), put em in the double x file
Of wack rappers, they gotta exile
Call me an undertaker, I use my mic like a guillotine
Take 10 seconds to find out what killer mean
There's always a sucker in the crowd that'll spill the beans
So just bodybag him and ship him to the Philippines
Mission accomplished like I promised
You're on a wack staff, I got the last laugh
I'm cold serious, nothin to smile for
You gotta brace yourself for the style wars

Cause these are the style wars
DJ Cee Just

(We are ready to go to war - now)

Ah yeah, Flavor Unit in effect
1990, small things behind me
Righteous Force Productions in effect
You know what I'm sayin
Cold rippin off necks

And I'm outta here
We in effect, y'all
Peace(Our people will survive America)

[ VERSE 1 ]
My people were took from the motherland
By the other man
Brought to the wilderness
Like a ventriloquist
Played my people like puppets by plantin fear in their heart
Nowadays most of us don't know where to start
10% of us can help, but don't feel the need
They love greed
And this really bothers me
85% of us are totally ignorant
Walkin around with the nigger ment-
Ality, 5% of us are ready to die for
The cause, of course the source is Elijah
Knowledge of self is what you need to stop the bull
If you don't get it, I'm held responsible
Rhymes I make are designed to reach the youth
I gotta teach, that's why I speak the truth
Some waste time dwellin on the past
It's time they know that we're the lost Tribe of Shabazz

(Our people will survive America)	(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Stay awake and don't sleep, cause I'm comin after ya
Devils I smash and leave em flat as a spatula
Back again, the mathmatical radical
Gettin emotional, very emphatical
The original man uses 23 million
Square miles on the planet Earth, constantly buildin
On the other hand the other man wants to confuse ya
Simple psychology, tricknowlogy fools ya
They have you believe we descend from cannibals
Show you pictures of Africans lookin like animals
How could we be animals, look at the things we did
With our own bare hands we built pyramids
Blind, deaf, and dumb is how they raised ya
To them it's Africa, to us it's Asia
To get to the point, to make it clear to ya
They're no superior, and we're not inferior
I got the other man pointin at me, cause I licked him
Took a stand for the blackman, and didn't fall victim
The nation is growin rapid and fast
That's why I'm tellin you we're the lost Tribe of Shabazz

(Our people will survive America)	(4x)

[ VERSE 3 ]
I couldn't wait to battle a beat like this track
Is so def, I had to pump my fist, black
My rhymes weigh six sextillion tons
Heavy as the Earth, a lyrical function
Imagine if every black man, woman and child
Would simply refuse
To go to work for one day
Do you know how much money these companies would lose?
Since everything's based on money, that's what we gotta get
We gotta learn when to quit, when not to quit
It's really sad, I know some people
Think that one day we'll be treated as equal
It's the Land of the Freedom, or so they say so
They tell you're free, yeah, but free to do what though?
Off our arms and legs they took the chains
Big deal - they still left em around our brains
Things I say make the government fear this
I speak with authority, so you can hear this
I hate oreos, that's why I gots to bomb
You so-called niggerish Uncle Toms
We're on a rise-up, you better wise up
You can't stop us, now are you surprised, duck?
You might take it as a political outblast
But we're the lost Tribe of Shabazz

(Our people will survive America)	(8x)I come across louder than a bull horn, a full-born
Human ghetto blaster that has to move on
The voice of choice to pound the sound that Mark made
If you sleep, huh, you catch a heartache
Toot and scream, woofers blow when I flow
Biters bite actin like they didn't know
Rhymes I make take the cake, they have to be
Sweet like sugar, Strawberry D'Acquery
I'll dilute your brain like [Name]
Brandy I'm dandy if you can't flow, walk
Off the set, go and get
Reinforcements or new concepts
See if you can match the man that has to stand
Militant and armed, ready to cold bomb
Get in your stance, here's your chance
Now you're gettin a blast
From Lak Shabazz
The voice of power

See, I been waitin to catch you, now I got you
I'ma mop you, make you walk the desert like Jacub
( ? ) and slob
Any negative thoughts? Yo, save it, hops
For the wack ones, I simply attack them
Do what I wanna do with em and ranshack em
( ? ) your fortress, I run through y'all
You're nothin but a bunch of knuckleheads, screwballs
This were a contest for money you wouldn't win a nickel
Your rhymes are too wack, you whimsical
My impact is that of a nuclear
Explosion, I'm unloadin, comin through to ya
Loud and clear, proud to bear witness
To the fact that I'm packed with swiftness
Now what you gotta say for yourself?
You might as well pray for help
Rappers like you, I eat em with battle rhymes
When the dinner bell ring, it's chow time
I rush the stage, grab the mic and rock a party for hours
I got the voice of power

Rhythms I ride with ease to please a crowd
With lyrics that totally tower
When I was young I made a vow
That thou will always possess the voice of power
I kick science you're bein dropped on
Gimme the mic, look at how the props swarm
And see the brother cold undertake
Gimme the cue, watch me stun the break
I'm gettin fed up, you're so wack, dag
You're like roaches and I'm the blackflag
You little insect, I put heads out
Rappers check in, but they don't check out
You waste time, you should learn to make
Deffer rhymes so I don't have to exterminate
I wasn't made to be ruled by no one
And it ain't no fun if I don't get none
The voice of power longs for strong rhymes that penetrate
Listen as Lakim demonstrates
Vocals I flow styles, I like the track
I sound crisp and some whisper, "How's he do that?"
5'4" and a connaisseur, so step slow
While you intake a vision from a video
I'm known to rock a party for hours
I got the voice of power

Ah yeah
Flavor Unit in effect

Lakim Shabazz
All that
You know what I'm sayin?
PeaceI see a devil I pulverize him, what else?
Smash him and beat him into little small particles
You'll realize that I'm here to do away with
Negativity and ( ? )
This is the topic, what? The devil or Satan, or better yet three times two
I got a question, I just gots to know, does it equal you?
Canivin are devils, devils are sneakish
I'm a rebel when I appear, they get weakish
I'ma drop jinx no matter what some think
( ? ) crash on the floor soon as the punk winks
I spot em by they ways and actions
I do the knowledge, I catch em and start taxin
They show you pictures of him, it's not him
They conceal this, you don't know you livin amongst him
They tell you that Heaven is in the sky
Hell is underground, come on now, open your eye
You're a snake, you do dirt
Some stray away from what I say cause the truth hurts
But I'ma keep droppin bombs
Makin hip-hoppers swarm
They know the tricks, so don't pass him
You come across a 666, then smash him

Devils, devils - come in all shapes, forms and fashions
Rebels, rebels - created for the purpose of simply smashin
Devils, devils - someone that I can't stand with a passion
Levels are set, I'm a definite threat, I find me a devil, I smash him
So listen as I speak
Open your eyes and get wise while I teach
Some people don't like what I like, they can all take a hike
It's the youth I reach
Don't sleep, see devils attack
Some devils are white, some devils are black
Nevertheless they're all sorts of meanings
Some of us think of him as some sort of demon
Some call him Satan, some call him Lucifer
I'm not scared, I'm prepared to tell the truth to ya
My meaning of the devil is raw
He's nothing but a bloodsucker of the poor
I push lyrics, you don't know how to push
I'm quite serious, far from ( ? )
Ready to roll, hands above your head
You make one move - you're dead
This is a land under siege
By a lyrical militant force, a rougher breed
A terrorist, lyrical terrorist
I advise you - what? To never diss
See, I never miss when I aim
Devils swished, they never came
Cause I smash em

While Mark brings the beat Just bring the cuts
I'll bring the rhymes and get praise like King Tut
It's no wonder my people
Get beated and treated unequal
Devils are made for devil missions
They've been doin this since they existed
Made to take over, bruise and make lower
Class of another man and it stinks
That till they rule the country, 10% of em
I found it was time to make a rhyme to get at him
I lead em out on a open plane
Then found that his brain was a bit strange
Hum, what a difference between him and us
But they still try to put a end of us
It won't work cause I'm a renegade
Of the nineties stage and I'm into
What goes on in my community
I strive for peace and unity
Although some can help, they choose to be greedy
And refuse to help the needy
But I'ma fight this with a righteous format
And use the devil like a doormat
They full of tricks, so don't pass em
You come across a 666, then smash him(Ooh
What you say
Come on)

My deejay is dope, def, real death-defyin
Competators, get with mental def tryin
The number one candidate, his hands'll make
Dancers dance, he possess the hands of fate
He'll scratch a record that will stand
Out from the rest that's def, and he'll jam
Anywhere at any given time and thrill fans
Totally blindfold his cuts will still slam
Harder than the average, make a savage kid
Nervous, the perfect combination had to get
Funkier than funk itself, now haven't you heard
He sharpens his claws for damagin a nerd
Just with the power, plus time to mutilate
You can't escape, don't even try to retaliate
Cee Just, do that shit, they thought you slipped
They didn't know that you were smoother than Cool Whip
Now prove it to em ( *cuts* ) scratch
Pull it back ( *cuts* ) yeah, I like that
Energetic, enthusiastic
Cuts are drastic, knowledge the tactics
Faster than a centipede. and all that he need
Is two tables and a crossfader to make the record bleed
Deejay of the year, got the number one candidate
And he possess the hands of fate

(Disc jock)
(Come on)

Deejays left to right throw in their white flags
The way that he scratch you think the record had crashed
Back and forth, forth and back as he'll attack
The turntable, that's why he's labelled an acrobat
You need to resign or take a spring break
First you was hard, now you're soft like a ice cream cake
Try to compete with the elite is a silly stunt
He'll smoke the crossfader like a Philly blunt
Manifest skills on the wheels of steel
The one-man band never ran, and he never will
He's a hitman, who's gonna be the next hit?
You wanna battle, you better bring your best shit
Courage, heart, balls, cuts
After all that you still get crushed like a wall nut
Damn, the brother's nice, I make em do a quicker slice
Sendin em toy deejays back to Fisher Price
Hard to categorize or analyze
The way that he scratch leave deejays paralyzed
Crisp and clean like a fully loaded magazine
The track is mean, he's prepared to rag a teen
Deejay Cee Just, he cuts, you couldn't beat us
Even if you were to cheat us
Stun ya, make you wonder how can he make
A record rag so much, he got the hands of fate

(He's Cee Just)

Sharper than a straight blade are my rhyme skills
They attack with the impact of a minefield
And I ain't even started to get loose yet
Turn up your Alpine, e.q. your gooseneck
Ladies say "aw!", fellas say "ho!"
Prepare to undergo
Lyrical surgery, you're gonna get hit, slayed
Rhymes'll crack your spine and bust your rib cage
I can't calculate the rappers I take out
Before the battle is through, most of them break out
I never lose, I aim to win
I'm just a rebel, killin like a Devil Tasmanian
To take a deejay out is a bear task
Who's def, he'll make you lose your breath like tear gas
Just, cut it up, cold smash the break
Show the people you possess the hands of fateTime to jam, I got a quarter grand ready to splurge
Suddenly I got the urge to watch some bodyslam
Ready to go clubs-hoppin, my pockets
Full of money and I'm feelin real funny
( ? ) figure eights in the place cold stun me
Then I got approached by this light skinned honey
Said, "Don't look surprised, see, I know who you are
Let's separate here and have a drink at the bar
My name's Sexy Betsy, you are a rap star
You got it goin on, I think you're gonna go real far"
Tried to flatter me, said my lips look sweet
And juicy, "and I bet it takes like a peach
What do you think?" I said, "Sex on the Beach"
A few more looks, I had her hooked like a leech
Five minutes we hung out, honey girl strung out
Now I coulda took honey girl home without a doubt
She start to stare, run my fingers all through her hair
You know what happened? A ( ? ) came out
I was surprised, didn't wanna believe
That my hand had to feel honey girl's hair weave
So I chilled, I didn't get ill or rowdy
Said, "See ya baby, I'm Audi like gowdy"
Thought it was real but it was fake, see, I was blind
You never know what you find
Dealin with

[ Chorus ]
(Ladies)
Got to have you lady, you sexy baby
(Ladies)
Bamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me
(Ladies)
Yes, I'm speakin to the fly women of the world
Peep it out
(Ladies)
Gimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls

I like ladies that's light skinned, brown skinned
The tone of skin to me makes no difference
I don't understand why some brothers frown
When they're approached by a woman who's dark or brown skinned
Some light skinned women think they're too good
Stay in the mirror all day and they think that they should
Find a man who's much more darker than them
Why choose your man by the color of skin?
I don't front, I tell straight facts
What I say has a very strong impact
I want you to know the eight shades of yellow
Eight shades of brown and it equals 16 shades of black
You need to wise up, cut out the bull crap
Whoever told you that need to be slapped
I don't smoke dust, not on a pipe or crack
The color of your skin to me doesn't mean jack
Because I know the right way to angle you
Most women are swift and changeable
Listen up laides, see, I got a thing for you
So now I'ma ( ? ) a few
Because I think it's bout time I let you know
I'm into women, but I'm not a superhoe
They're so mysterious, there's somethin about em
You can't live em and I can't live without em

[ Chorus ]

Break it down

( *sax solo* )

Get on the dancefloor, make sure you don't trip
Don't front now, I see you're pluckin those lips
Get a grip on a groove and don't slip
Shake it all around and roll your hips
Hourglass bodies that look sexy sassy
I'm the type that won't let a honey pass me
I'm not a dog, my name's not Lassie
Every once in a while I feel kinda nasty
Cool and calm, composure's kept
But some honeys think I'm only out to get my thing wet
My main goal is to control your soul
On the dancefloor cause like Keith, I'll make you sweat
Because you're so tender
Leavin me breathless, so this message I send ya
They're so mysterious, there's somethin about em
You can't live em and I can't live without

[ Chorus ]

Yeah, uknowmsayin?
This is how I feel about you ladies in the '90s
Cause y'all so sweet and tender
So I had to kick one out for you, yeah
This is Lakim Shabazz in full effect, 1990
And like L.L. said, 'small things are definitely behind me'
See ya(We were stripped from our land
They took our families and deliberately broke them apart
Took the father one place, the mother some place else
And then they had the child whose mind was white
Once they indoctrinate him with all this inferiority talk)

(...in Africa with your blood relatives)

(I'm mad as hell and I ain't gonna take no more)

(This business of justice is not new)

No justice
No peace [x2]

What is the world comin to?
What are we gonna do?
I'm disgusted, so we must get
Ready to become militant rebels
Cause there will never be no peace without justice
I'm tired of my people treated unequal
That's why I'm ( ? ) I gotta face this
So I speak out and those who don't like it, they freak out
And they label me a racist
I'ma keep sparkin, me and brothers like Al Sharpton
We don't like what they did to Yusef Hawkins
Why was the trial prolonged for so long?
They shot him in cold blood, they knew they was dead wrong
Let a brotherman shoot the other man
Nowadays they lock em up in a second and throw the key away
Hold up, you think I fold up? No, I'm geased
Without no justice there'll be no peace

No justice
There will never be...
No peace
Without...
No justice
There will never be...
No peace

See, I'm a programmed warrior, built to last
A Five Percenter who descends from the Lost Tribe of Shabazz
Barin the truth, I'm not scared of ya
Is this the United States or the United Snakes of America?
This is a livin hell and I'm not ( ? )
I refuse to burn in America's melting pot
I'm angry, you can't refrain me, I make em all see
Word is bond it was wrong how they did [Name]
As far as I can see her privacy was exploited
They beat her and raped her, put her in the back of manure
Engraved 'nigger' on the stomach
Up to this day a lot of people think she fronted
Is it a lie or is it incidental?
People who are raped names' supposed to be kept confidential
But she was exploited at a young age, it's such a shame
I never heard the Central Park jogger's name
But straight to the point and on the ball
I be the universal true Son of Man and and a ( ? )
I pity you idiots like Arsenio Hall
Jokes about our sister, he thinks it's funny, y'all
It's sad to see ( ? ) so much as a minor
I'm glad to see the Nation of Sslam refined her
You want peace, well, let the unjust stuff cease
If we don't have justice, there will be no peace

No justice
There will never be...
No peace
Without...
No justice
There will never be...
No peace

Break it down

(I think that the solution rests with the people
It's a mistake to rely on professors
Racism is learned
Nobody is born a racist
And some people have Ph.D.'s in racism)

The Mighty Maestro created a beat that was lethal
The source to bring forth power to the people
The rhythm was made to be rolled by the host
So I'ma ride the rhythm from New York to the West Coast
Brotherman takin a stand, demandin respect
I'm not with the situation in Teaneck
They said he was dangerous, well, I'm concerned
How could he be so dangerous with his back turned?
They said, "Freeze! Halt!" The brother stopped
Threw his hands in the air, yeah, and still he got shot
They said he had a shiny object in his hand
So they killed the man
And is this justice, no way, José
He didn't get arrested, he was suspended with pay
Talk about armed and dangerous, accounted
How come I never heard nothin else about it?
I'm dead up, I'm goin head up, see, the buck stops
Here, I'm sick and tired of corrupt cops
I gotta drop cause I don't think it will ever stop
My brain is a Tec-9 and it's kept cocked
And it's got just a few more rounds to go
They're goin pound for pound, blow for blow
You want peace, let the unjust stuff cease
If we don't have justice, there'll be no peace

No justice
There will never be...
No peace
Without...
No justice
There will never be...
No peace

No justice
No peace

Peace to Allah's Nation

(...they come together in dialogue and solve the problem)(Okay budddy - start playin)

Hush-hush pooh-putts, I lay ya like sheet rock
He thought he'd rock me, what a peacock
You ( ? ) creampuff cornpie
I'd get a million for my rhymes if I took em to a pawnshop
A musical menace, in awareness I make slammin hits
I got flavor more than a banana split
Prepare yourself for a hip-hop, a knock, a blast
A hitman for hire by the name of Lak Shabazz
I elevate till I raise the roof
Girls get naked and give me their bathing suits
Like a magnet I cling to the mic, I don't swing a knife
I'm like GE, I 'bring good things to life'
One of the chosen few holding you under siege
Wanna bleed, I treat you like weed and a fonto leaf
Roll ya, smoke ya, you should hold ya breath
I see smoke comin out your ears from the notes of def

It ain't nothin like ( ? ) listenin to a serious saxophone
That cracks the dome open wide
To a smooth sound, who's bound to do now
Not too many, I see a lot of them go and hide
The subject is that I must get
Hype, this is a chain, a connnection of ruffnecks
You're weak and not wise, you move counterclock-wise
You should know that I swap flies
The microphone gets clutched like a turning kit
Gimme a scratch, watch me burn a bit
Yo, I hold information like a microchip
I'm rough and rugged, I might as well go head and flip
Into a lyrical round-off
All I hear in my ear is that they love the way it sounds off
The way I beat on a rap was quite brutal
I make em completely ineffective, futile
Rhymes I could rock, I'm in a good spot
I turn sell out crowds and pack em in like Woodstock
Been a long time since you heard a rhyme like mine
You're impatiently waiting for the punchline
But it won't come till I'm done, so beware, son
My vocals are deadly, most get scared and run
For reinforcements, I'll enforce this
Law of how to get raw, watch my force rip
Take a sip, the beats'll hit you
Here's a chance to dance, now may the force be with you
Rhymes ( ? ) like kerosine
You ride my saddle, you wanna battle, you get creamed
You better quit I don't think you can deal with
I was made mentally, physically fit
To take heads, cold rip to shreads
Call on the coastguard, I rip the feds
45 King is in the effect mood
He'll produce and get loose with a correct groove
You need to back off, you can't hang with us
We're not dope, we're more like angel dust
The earth is mine, every square mile of it
You miss the flavor, got piles of it
I drew my path for those that follow it
My impact is like that of a hollow tip
I'll arrange the style, don't change the dial
I'm refined with the rhyme that'll make you smile
Cee Just remain serious, no time to play
Stay still, nobody move, watch him display
Talents and techniques as I speak, the weak
Freak cause I'm sleak and unique
Horns are horny, the snare drum makes some retreat
Cee Just on the cut and the King's on the beat
My voice is choice from baritone to bassclef
And these are the notes of def
