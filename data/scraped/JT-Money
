Let it go
Let it go
If the ho wanna ho nigga let it go(4x)

[JT Money Talkin]
That's what im talkin bout
Niggas need to let it go, ya know
Hearin all these stories about, niggas goin to jail
Diein bout these muthafuckin ho's, you know what im talkin about

[Chorus]
Ho problems ain't no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that ain't gone solve em
Nigga you need to let that muthafucka go
Just like you got it you can find another ho

[JT Money]
See ho's come a dime a dozen
What you is nigga hard up but lovin
Pushin and shovin abouts a woman
Who givin up the ass
Homeboy ya buggin
I told you bout trustin them stankin ass H-O's
You gotta learn to work them bitches for the PESO's
Stop trippin bout that pussy cuz it AINT YOUR's
Y'all niggas need to learn how the game go
It's a trip and I will tell yo' ass no more
Young nigga put shit past no ho
For you cry like a sucka go solo
Cuz them bitches damn sure call the Po-Po's
In any case bro

[Chrous]
Ho Problems ain't no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that ain't gone solve em
Nigga'z fall in love but they just dont know
When you gonna learn to let a ho be a ho(my nigga) (x2)

[JT Money}
It's another one of them ho things
Niggas be a addicted like cocaine
Straight up and down naw that ain't the way to go man
Quit trippin bout them grabbin ass gold diggers
Naw real niggas fall jus cuz you a ho nigga
Spend a lotsa loots jus so you can knock the boots
Of a  slimy ass scandolous prostatute
Nigga you betta try to fade dat bitch
Cuz me and the boys straight slayed that bitch(mmmhmm)
And I ain't liein neither
Trippin bout them ho's betta leave that shit to beaver
Cuz a nigga run through yo shit
Fuckin all these ho's and dont give a fuck who yo' bitch
Cuz shit get bad for your health
And if you got ho problems betta keep em to yourself
Probably alotta other niggas that'll hit her
But you just a weak nigga that fell in love with em

[Chrous]
Ho Problems ain't no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that ain't gone solve em
Nigga'z fall in love but they just dont know
When you gonna learn to let a ho be a ho(my nigga) (x2)

[JT Money]
What if your girl let another nigga hit it
Would you accept it our would you cry like a bitch
You'd probably try to kill her then kill yourself
Sayin she wasn't real but you wasn't real yourself
Cuz you knew she was a ho when you met her
But the pussy so good you just wanted it forever
And it hurt you to know another nigga got it
But tell me dogg what could you do to stop it
NOTHIN!

[Chrous]
Ho Problems ain't no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that ain't gone solve em
Nigga'z fall in love but they just dont know
When you gonna learn to let a ho be a ho(my nigga) (x2)

[JT Money Talkin]

Let you niggas knowa bout these ho's
Teach you bout this game FO SHO! baby

[Chrous]
Ho Problems ain't no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that ain't gone solve em
Nigga'z fall in love but they just dont know
When you gonna learn to let a ho be a ho(my nigga) (x4)[JT Money]
Yo, what's up?

You say you daddy to come through and regulate?

[Verse 1: Sole']
It could be 4, 5 or 6, you bet' not be nowhere laid up wit no bitch
You betta bring that home to momma, don't be playin and shit
If you get horny when you out, no need for eyein' them hoes
Why eat a burger when you got steak and potatoes at home?
A short drive is all it takes, I'm just a phone call away
Ain't no excuses mutha fucka for you runnin astray
I give it to you when you want it ain't no other's like mine
Yo ex-bitch can't fuck with this, so don't be wastin' yo time
The Indian, black mix, boy like I told you before
And we can ay yi yi the fur rug on my living room floor
And ain't nan ho gon' bring it like you know I'mma bring it
And ain't nan ho gon' freak it like you know I'mma freak it
And ain't nan ho gon' shake it like you know I'mma shake it
And ain't nan ho gon' take it like you know I'mma take it
So don't make me come lookin for you, pull you outta some mix
Then turn around and bust you in yo shit for 4, 5 or 6

[Hook: Kandi]
I don't care if it's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in the morning
Boy you better call me when you think you gettin horny
I don't give a damn bout who you with
Just as long as you ain't givin up my shit
(Repeat)

[Verse 2: JT Money]
You know me as your player, your pipe layer, your all night stayer
All up in your sauce when you need your rocks off
Knock your socks off, baby off the chain in this bitch
Have your wide ass open while I'm slangin' this dick
Got you lovin' this shit, suckin and fuckin this dick
Wanna go and make some bucks for this dick
Fightin' all in the club for this dick
I'm that player that you chose
Long as you satisfied, baby fuck them other hoes
Just keep my pussy horny so you can put it on me
Girl you know I'm the only one who can satisfy your monkey
Ain't nobody gon' do you like I do when I put this love stick inside you
Money man guaranteed to satisfy you
Have you open all night like a drive-through
So bring yo thang on so I can get my bang on
I hope you likes a good fuck because my game strong
And I ain't lyin' girl you wouldn't if you could quit
I signs my name on that pussy, Mr. Good Dick
That's my shit

(Hook: Kandi (Repeat)]

[Verse 3: Sole']
Now nigga what you gone do, ugh, let me put this good lovin on you
We can do everything that you want to

Stay wet, stay tight, keep you comin' back
Go all night feelin' right, you be lovin that
Hell yeah, like wanna make enough moves
Fuckin you boy like I got something to prove
Runnin loose, fuck it nigga gotta pay dues
Make you wanna tell ya boys all about whose

Hi-Fi shit nigga, get sick with this, say

Don't you deny it nigga, don't even try it nigga
You makin claims that you laid wit the fly nigga
Don't know, your name, it still, remains

YEAH![Intro: Luke]
UH! Yo fuck ass niggas
Let me tell y'all one thing right now I just don't give a fuck!
I'mma let niggas just RIP y'all motherfuckin' throwdown y'all
Gay ass motherfuckers! Snoop ass ho ass dog ass nigga!
Dre you ain't nothin' but my bitch I'mma make you my bitch!
You look like you could suck a nigga' dick ho ass motherfucker!!

[Verse 1: JT Money]
I know niggas ain't tryin' to diss comin' with that wack shit
Keep tryin' to front, get your motherfuckin' back split
And yo' ass kicked! Your shit is drastic!
Run up on my nigga, get your punk ass blasted!
Real niggas don't talk that gay shit
Talk about, let another nigga suck ya dick
Only punks talk like that
I won't even bust ya; I'll slap you with my gat!
Frontin' like a gangsta, but you's a faggot
See if you can act it, but you can't back it
A nigga like me won't play wit' ya
I'mma BUCK BUCK BUCK when I get ya!
Fuck it, I'm Goin' All Out
Step on Death Row and spray up ya house, nigga!
Dumb motherfucker tryin' to talk bad
Fuck around, get a missile launched in yo' ass
And for your homies talkin' fly shit
If we was locked up together I'd have made 'em MY bitches!
Cause I know y'all pranksters
Y'all niggas still Fakin' Like Gangsters! Fuck y'all!!

[Clayvosie]
It's about time for me to tear the roof off the motherfucker
I grab the gat to make you fuck-niggas run for cover
You can fool a groupie, but you can't fool a gangsta
1985, you used to be a fuckin' prankster
Down with Alonzo and the World Wreckin' Cru
Turnin' off the lights and dressin' like bitches too
Every nigga on Death Row must be a joke
I put a level to the chair and watch you niggas smoke
Real niggas don't follow punks down here
I guess your nigga Snoopie Dogg must be a queer
So who the fuck you gonna blast here in Miami?
Fuck with me and I'll kill your whole family!
And I do mean ho', you think I'm playin', son?
I got my Glock to your head, now where you gonna run?
Before you diss my nigga Luke, you better think twice
I'll pull a trigger, nigga, and turn off your life!

[Luke:]
Yeah, fuck-ass nigga, you just don't know! A nigga know about yo'
Motherfuckin' ass with them "Turn Off the Lights" days! Nigga
When you was sittin' on them album covers with the motherfuckin'
Lip gloss, and them sequins outfits on, nigga, I know what a nigga want
You to do right now! Nigga, you know what I want you to do for me
Right now? I want you to just, *music stops*
Take off that g-string, ba-by
Cause you know you look real cra-zy
And you gon' be my ho - maybe -
I just don't like this nigga
Yo, Mike Fresh, let's just take these fuck-niggas' beat!!
*The opening of the instrumental track from "Fuck Wit Dre Day"*
Yeah, this is how we do, we take fuck-niggas' beat!
Yo, better yet, fuck that shit, my nigga, fuck that shit!
*The record needle is dragged off*
Yo, my nigga, bring the real shit in!
Get that ol' coochie shit outta here!!
*The "Cowards" track comes back on*

[Verse 2: JT Money]
Verse two, motherfucker, I still hit you with the ill shit
Fuck with my nigga and yo' ass'll get killed quick
Pussy nigga, you ain't shit!!
Did a whole album of other niggas pullin' your dick
I'll wreck your whole staff
Bust shots at they ass, you niggas can't last!
So don't try to flip the script, money grip
Got a tech on my hip, plus I'm in the mood to trip
And I'll take your 4-4
Take a walk down Death Row, them niggas get Petrol
Cause that shit ain't nothin' but soft-town
Play bad, get knocked the fuck off, clown
I'll be on the D.L. scopin'
Catch you slippin', leave your motherfuckin' chest open
That nigga changed gears like a 10-speed
Last album, that nigga was against
Weed
Now he's mister Chronic-man
Get high, nigga, try to play bionic man
Act like you wanna be tough
And we gon' see who'll really get fucked, ya fuck!!

[Luke:]
Yeah, fuck-ass nigga, lemme tell you somethin'! What you gon'
Be? You gon' be a real nigga or you gon' be a flaunt, nigga? You gon'
Be on weed, or you ain't gon' be on weed? You gon' be a bruise next
Year! Aaight, what you gon' be on this motherfuckin' year? Let me
Tell you somethin' 'bout a nigga, right? All real niggas - I mean, you
Lookin' at a real nigga, nigga, now lemme tell you somethin', have you
Ever got head on stage, then? I'll get head from yo' motherfuckin' ho
On stage! You let the bitch be in the audience, cause I'mma take that
Pussy! You a pussy-ass, cock-ass nigga! Lemme tell you somethin'!
Cowards in Compton get sprayed in dank! Cowards in Compton get
Sprayed in dank, pussy!! Cowards in Compton get sprayed in
Motherfuckin' dank!! You ho-ass nigga, you my bitch, bitch!!
JT (in the manner of Dre): HELL yeah!

Announcer (talking rapidly):
Luke Records would like to acknowledge that all references made in the previous work towards homosexuals is not reflecting anti-homosexual position on our part. Our problem was just homosexuals by the name of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg[Sammie]
1 - Ooh, ooh yeah
From the bottom to the top
I got 'em

Repeat 1 during intro

Yeah, yeah Miami
Yeah the place to go
Cause we got beaches
We got them all
We got everything
Hundred and ten degrees
Sunshine city baby
Represent

I was up in the hood
Down at my boy's house
It was the summer time
When everyone would hang out
Down at the corner store
We had the best of times
Yelling bingo at every car that came by

2 - I knew that I had this dream
And I wanted them to believe
That I was gonna make it

Repeat 1

It happened so fast
I can't believe at last
I headed to the ATL
Just to hear the sound
Hooked up with Dallas
And he had a record planned
Then JT Money said
He would put Miami down

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 until rap

[JT Money]
Yeah that bottom, yeah
I'm from the city where the bass drop
Where the girls and the temperature stay hot
That bottom where that bass game started
And the girls shake their thing whole-hearted
MIA, 48 cabinets
Straight luggin' and it don't be happening
Old school on the fools and the chumps
Let it out playing old school funk
Big Sammie put it down for the bottom
Fly honeys want money we got 'em
What'cha know about the Miami heat huh?
About how they shoot or what all that street?
A place where all the stuff retreat
Where they move to an up tempo beat
Never sleep, you know this thing don't stop
Coming from the bottom straight to the top
Fo' sure* from the forthcoming "Pimpin' on Wax"

Spoken
Pimpin hoes ain't dead
My eyes is red mother fucker
Smoking trees and B's
I got many hoes on they knees
From pittsburgh to mexico
I got all kinda hoes Nigga
You better recognize and realize
Real game ain't no thang
It's just a new thang
Play with it bitch[Intro: Luke]
UH! Yo fuck ass niggas
Let me tell y'all one thing right now I just don't give a fuck!
I'mma let niggas just RIP y'all motherfuckin' throwdown y'all
Gay ass motherfuckers! Snoop ass ho ass dog ass nigga!
Dre you ain't nothin' but my bitch I'mma make you my bitch!
You look like you could suck a nigga' dick ho ass motherfucker!!

[Verse 1: JT Money]
I know niggas ain't tryin' to diss comin' with that wack shit
Keep tryin' to front, get your motherfuckin' back split
And yo' ass kicked! Your shit is drastic!
Run up on my nigga, get your punk ass blasted!
Real niggas don't talk that gay shit
Talk about, let another nigga suck ya dick
Only punks talk like that
I won't even bust ya; I'll slap you with my gat!
Frontin' like a gangsta, but you's a faggot
See if you can act it, but you can't back it
A nigga like me won't play wit' ya
I'mma BUCK BUCK BUCK when I get ya!
Fuck it, I'm Goin' All Out
Step on Death Row and spray up ya house, nigga!
Dumb motherfucker tryin' to talk bad
Fuck around, get a missile launched in yo' ass
And for your homies talkin' fly shit
If we was locked up together I'd have made 'em MY bitches!
Cause I know y'all pranksters
Y'all niggas still Fakin' Like Gangsters! Fuck y'all!!

[Clayvosie]
It's about time for me to tear the roof off the motherfucker
I grab the gat to make you fuck-niggas run for cover
You can fool a groupie, but you can't fool a gangsta
1985, you used to be a fuckin' prankster
Down with Alonzo and the World Wreckin' Cru
Turnin' off the lights and dressin' like bitches too
Every nigga on Death Row must be a joke
I put a level to the chair and watch you niggas smoke
Real niggas don't follow punks down here
I guess your nigga Snoopie Dogg must be a queer
So who the fuck you gonna blast here in Miami?
Fuck with me and I'll kill your whole family!
And I do mean ho', you think I'm playin', son?
I got my Glock to your head, now where you gonna run?
Before you diss my nigga Luke, you better think twice
I'll pull a trigger, nigga, and turn off your life!

[Luke:]
Yeah, fuck-ass nigga, you just don't know! A nigga know about yo'
Motherfuckin' ass with them "Turn Off the Lights" days! Nigga
When you was sittin' on them album covers with the motherfuckin'
Lip gloss, and them sequins outfits on, nigga, I know what a nigga want
You to do right now! Nigga, you know what I want you to do for me
Right now? I want you to just, *music stops*
Take off that g-string, ba-by
Cause you know you look real cra-zy
And you gon' be my ho - maybe -
I just don't like this nigga
Yo, Mike Fresh, let's just take these fuck-niggas' beat!!
*The opening of the instrumental track from "Fuck Wit Dre Day"*
Yeah, this is how we do, we take fuck-niggas' beat!
Yo, better yet, fuck that shit, my nigga, fuck that shit!
*The record needle is dragged off*
Yo, my nigga, bring the real shit in!
Get that ol' coochie shit outta here!!
*The "Cowards" track comes back on*

[Verse 2: JT Money]
Verse two, motherfucker, I still hit you with the ill shit
Fuck with my nigga and yo' ass'll get killed quick
Pussy nigga, you ain't shit!!
Did a whole album of other niggas pullin' your dick
I'll wreck your whole staff
Bust shots at they ass, you niggas can't last!
So don't try to flip the script, money grip
Got a tech on my hip, plus I'm in the mood to trip
And I'll take your 4-4
Take a walk down Death Row, them niggas get Petrol
Cause that shit ain't nothin' but soft-town
Play bad, get knocked the fuck off, clown
I'll be on the D.L. scopin'
Catch you slippin', leave your motherfuckin' chest open
That nigga changed gears like a 10-speed
Last album, that nigga was against
Weed
Now he's mister Chronic-man
Get high, nigga, try to play bionic man
Act like you wanna be tough
And we gon' see who'll really get fucked, ya fuck!!

[Luke:]
Yeah, fuck-ass nigga, lemme tell you somethin'! What you gon'
Be? You gon' be a real nigga or you gon' be a flaunt, nigga? You gon'
Be on weed, or you ain't gon' be on weed? You gon' be a bruise next
Year! Aaight, what you gon' be on this motherfuckin' year? Let me
Tell you somethin' 'bout a nigga, right? All real niggas - I mean, you
Lookin' at a real nigga, nigga, now lemme tell you somethin', have you
Ever got head on stage, then? I'll get head from yo' motherfuckin' ho
On stage! You let the bitch be in the audience, cause I'mma take that
Pussy! You a pussy-ass, cock-ass nigga! Lemme tell you somethin'!
Cowards in Compton get sprayed in dank! Cowards in Compton get
Sprayed in dank, pussy!! Cowards in Compton get sprayed in
Motherfuckin' dank!! You ho-ass nigga, you my bitch, bitch!!
JT (in the manner of Dre): HELL yeah!

YEAH!(69 Boyz)
Ugh
Now you can be a cute country girl from Idaho
Thats 23 who ain't never been outside before
Locked in the basement without a radio or t.v
And still know that if you go to the embassy sweet
At 2 0 clock in the morning, then the chance is strong
15 minutes later for your pants to be gone
Fold it up in the recliner right next to ya shirt
Right next to ya bra that's right next to ya purse
Right next to the kingsize B-E-D
You coulda stayed at ya crib to watch B.E.T
Cuz if you come to see me at the M.G.M
And ya faking then ya outta here like MC Em
Cuz before I sit around and watch you play naieve
I rather ask you to leave so I could catch some Z's
And I ain't trying to be rude
I'm just busting a flow so that you know before you come through my hotel
Door that

(chorus)
If it's 2 0 clock
And you don't wanna let ya panties drop
So I can make that booty hop
Then watcha doing in my hotel room
I don't know whats on ya mind
Well if it ain't that 69
Back up by the bump and grind
Then watcha doing in my hotel room

(69 Boyz)
Enough of that
Too much shine and recline
Time to bring the room more thrill than 69
Whys you in mine?
If you ain't giving it thats flat 9 outta 10 times
You only good on yo back
Contradicted what you speak I see the tweak in yo eye
The type of female only freaking when she drunk or she high
Be it not I keep it both that ain't my way to advance
But when you do beg yaself to get naked and dance
If you ain't with it let me know
Don't be stopping my stroke
Cuz you can leave I call some more we'll continue to smoke
Ain't no lac all my luxury unless I'm tapping ya lid
I bought em all for 2 reasons what you think this is
Well it ain't a big nigga tell ya straight out the mouth
If you ain't heard of dog talk where they talk in the south
From outta nowhere make a debut uplifted my image
If it ain't sex get outta my room conversation is finished

(chorus)

(69 Boyz)
I know what you came here for
Please don't front on me
No no
Lolly pop love is what I have in store

(JT Money)
Say whats up sweet thang
As you came we finna get off the chain
Juss me and you after 2 playing grown up games
Now baby tell me what you came fo
I hope the freak between them secrets thats exactly how this game go
It ain't gonna change so girl you can stop fronting
You know this time of night a playa be expecting something
You say you tired and wanna chill I ain't with that
You wants to chit chat girl I wants to hit that
I wanna get it on till the early morn
I'm already bone trying to get some loving girl you dead wrong
Fronting like bustling what you came to do
Girl out the 2 shoot busting is the thang to do
I peep that game in ya
If you gonna play you can flex
Cuz ain't nothing on my mind this time of night but sex
Getting my rocks on
Knock ya socks off ya feet
Trying to act all shy but girl you know you a freak

(chorus)

If it's 2 0 clock
And you don't wanna let ya panties drop
So I can make that booty hop[JT Money]
Yo, what's up?

I feel like you need to get home before yo shit be outside
[JT Money]
You say you daddy to come through and regulate?
What? Put his thang down, what? It's all good

[Verse 1: Sole']
It could be 4, 5 or 6, you bet' not be nowhere laid up wit no bitch
You betta bring that home to momma, don't be playin and shit
If you get horny when you out, no need for eyein' them hoes
Why eat a burger when you got steak and potatoes at home?
A short drive is all it takes, I'm just a phone call away
Ain't no excuses mutha fucka for you runnin astray
I give it to you when you want it ain't no other's like mine
Yo ex-bitch can't fuck with this, so don't be wastin' yo time
The Indian, black mix, boy like I told you before
And we can ay yi yi the fur rug on my living room floor
And ain't nan ho gon' bring it like you know I'mma bring it
And ain't nan ho gon' freak it like you know I'mma freak it
And ain't nan ho gon' shake it like you know I'mma shake it
And ain't nan ho gon' take it like you know I'mma take it
So don't make me come lookin for you, pull you outta some mix
Then turn around and bust you in yo shit for 4, 5 or 6

[Hook: Kandi]
I don't care if it's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in the morning
Boy you better call me when you think you gettin horny
I don't give a damn bout who you with
Just as long as you ain't givin up my shit
(Repeat)

[Verse 2: JT Money]
You know me as your player, your pipe layer, your all night stayer
All up in your sauce when you need your rocks off
Knock your socks off, baby off the chain in this bitch
Have your wide ass open while I'm slangin' this dick
Got you lovin' this shit, suckin and fuckin this dick
Wanna go and make some bucks for this dick
Fightin' all in the club for this dick
I'm that player that you chose
Long as you satisfied, baby fuck them other hoes
Just keep my pussy horny so you can put it on me
Girl you know I'm the only one who can satisfy your monkey
Ain't nobody gon' do you like I do when I put this love stick inside you
Money man guaranteed to satisfy you
Have you open all night like a drive-through
So bring yo thang on so I can get my bang on
I hope you likes a good fuck because my game strong
And I ain't lyin' girl you wouldn't if you could quit
I signs my name on that pussy, Mr. Good Dick
That's my shit

(Hook: Kandi (Repeat)]

[Verse 3: Sole']
Now nigga what you gone do, ugh, let me put this good lovin on you
We can do everything that you want to
Cause I like it real freaky, nigga don't you
That's right, don't make no promises
Can't find none better than mommas is
Stay wet, stay tight, keep you comin' back
Go all night feelin' right, you be lovin that
Hell yeah, like wanna make enough moves
Fuckin you boy like I got something to prove
Runnin loose, fuck it nigga gotta pay dues
Make you wanna tell ya boys all about whose
No talkin' now, come get the good shit
Make you never wanna fuck another hood bitch
Have ya breakin' off plans to come and lay me
Mutha fucka, don't ever try and play me

[Hook till fade]Hook

Yo if you wanna go to war, its alright
Well if you ain't hardcore, its alright
You wanna get it on nigga, its alright
Its alright (its alright), It's alright (its alright) (x2)

(JT Money)
I got a problem with fuck niggas
Always talkin' shit and try to duck niggas
Sucker niggas won't finish what they started
Be coppin' dueces cause them niggas soft-hearted
They straight bitches
Always puttin' on shows for these niggas and hoes
Be wantin' to run your mouth but won't throw no blows
Ain't got no scrap, better kill that rap
Think life is a game, until that ass get tapped
And when it do, what you do, you run like a bitch
Or do you straight turn state on a nigga and snitch
When you ain't got your boys, you ain't got no balls
And you ain't gangsta with all them 911 calls
Real niggas don't call police
Real niggas handle theirs when they got beef
Flawed niggas talk shit and know they can't back it
Know they ain't real but always trying to act it

Hook

I'm the original jacker, flawed boy attacker
Taking your life ain't nothing but a factor
Matter of fact, I'm a killer straight out the slums
No time to dump, I got these pumps for you chumps
And I ain't talking bout' the reeboks
Getting three Glocks and jumping out of treetops
Making suckers flee spots, and leave knots
Got guns, get funds, yeah I'm packing styles
Suckers acting foul, get smoked like Black and Milds
Nigga know a plan, laying down this thing
Beyond all that rap shit, I only spit game
You scared, say you scared, but just peep what I said
I'm so wicked off the head, probably shoot out of dread
Thats right, all you suckers better recognize
Before I start recognizing, ain't gonna have you niggas sweatin' mine
I'm in this thang for real, ain't nothing fake here
Putting down in the zone with my nigga Shakespeare

Hook

(Big Gipp)
I wear my hat low, when I walk through a circle of folks I don't know
It ain't to much chalk in these streets that can hold me back
I make stacks and stacks, for the weeks and weeks I got slapped
Freaks, I got the grill with the white gold
Keep a pistol in my hand with the tight hold
From the city where they drop blows
Known to pin-hold down off them figure fours
Shit shady, we all about to bust on sight, lighting up the night
Putting hoes off in 74's and watching em' all blow
It ain't shit funny, its the money man and Gipp
Holding sawed-off pumps in your face chump
Don't disrespect the city, streets, that I'm standing on
Niggas from Miami and Atlanta holdin' heat
It ain't nothing happy
You see, it ain't all about that rapping

Hook

(JT Money)
Straight up and down, I'm a let you fuck nigga know
You niggas don't want war, talking all that shit
Cause you apted up on that motherfucking tough guy juice
Get round' the motherfucking boys, listen to this goddamn rap music
And niggas think its a motherfucking game
Alright, play with it
Jt Money, Big Gipp, let you niggas know

HookY'all got this motherfuckin pumped up
I noticed ain't nobody smokin wit me

[Chorus till end][Intro: Luke]
Yo this is a record about stars fakin like gangstas
Gangstas trying to be stars
Stars wanting to be ganstas but they really pranksters
So I had to get my man JT cause we the only true two ex-cons on staff
And so we could kick it to you straight and not fake
Aiyyo JT, kick it

[Verse One: JT Money]
Picture a nigga as raw as me, the motherfuckin J to the T
Tired of niggas saying how bad they are
Fronting like ganstas but I call them Gang-stars
Stars that want to be gangsters
But I'm from the real side not like Jeckyll and Hyde
Bad boys on stage, fuck niggas on the street
You see that ain't me
Example - niggas go to concerts fucked up
The next thing you know the nigga's gettin chumped up
And they don't look so tough to me
I guess niggas ain't the same on and off TV
But not me, I grab the mike and shoot game
And on the streets it's the same motherfuckins thang
See I pop no bullshit
If you offended wear it if the motherfucking shoe fits
But don't have two left feet
Fuck around get your ass split to the white meat
Cause y'all ain't nothing but pranksters
Fuck niggas faking like gangstas

[Luke]
I can't stand a nigga talking about a gangsta
Nigga ain't nothing but a motherfuckin prangsta
Nigga ain't never been to jail
Bigga ain't never put a cap in a nigga
Nigga just talking about dropping a nigga
Cause he saw another nigga drop a nigga on TV
Aye yo JT kick example 2

[Verse 2: JT Money]
Example two, the neighborhood chump
Andy Gump came across a sawed off pump
I guess the nigga's now longer a punk
Cause now he talks shit and quick to pop the trunk
Young nigga turned bad over night
Maybe that dumb shit got his ass hype
Walking around with a unit in the place
Hanging with the big boys smoking lace
But his wall ain't up to date
And I hate fuck niggas who perpetrate
Like niggas makin' love songs first
Next time you see em, all they do is curse
Talkin bout the niggas they killed
First they was lovers, now they trying be real
And for the other nigga talkin' this-and-that
About kids hearin' all this on the rap
And for the ones talking 'bout the white man
Ever told your fans who's your bossman?
I guess that makes y'all prankstas
Fuck niggas fakin like gangstas!

[Luke]
Fuck niggas you got me worried, yes you got me worried
Because first of all yall talkin this black shit, black this black that
The whiteman's still collecting y'all money
You ain't told yo motherfucking fans that, huh?
It's a whole different tale about niggas who getting it like this

"Real niggas" Faking like gangstas
"Real niggas" Faking like gangstas
"You guys know who I'm talking to...Ohhh! (NWA)

[Verse 3: JT Money]
None of them fuck niggas ever did time
But while it's on my mind
We got up 4 in the morning fo cold eggs and grits
Jim Jones and doo-doo on a stick
Niggas had to eat this shit everyday
And one nigga got shanked over a tray
And you gotta have your set up to date
While niggas be scrapping fo a place
And nobody snitches
Cause snitches get stiches for talking like bitches
They wouldn't last cause they prankstas
Cunt niggas faking like gangstas(JT Money)
What up G'yea
Father to son, know what it is

What up son, how you feelin'?
It won't be long before I return in God's willin'
But in the mean time, do everything grandma tell ya
Follow her words, and I promise you they won't fail ya
Just be strong and take care of your little sister (...boiiy)
Tell her that I love her and that daddy miss her
You know I love you two, just keep doin' good in school
And remember bein' bad, boy, don't make you cool
Might make a fool of yourself, or you'll end up like me
Incarserated and I know you will be s and b
We should be free, my son, you know I wouldn't lie to you
So make the garden, and these hoes don't apply to you
Ya heard me boy?
You gotta dedicate your life to God
Cause he's the one who blessed you from the start and made you smart
I know you smart, that's why I write you this type of letter
But I shouldn't worry too much because we raised you better
Me and my momma, and I know that you gonna represent
And thank you for the letters and the pensions that you sent
You made me happy, I was blessed with you when I was young
And we gonna grow up together, father and son, father and son

(JT Hook)
Nobody seperate us that's a fact
I'm never goin' back to the projects, the black man just stay largest
Down in the hoosy-a-way
It hurt my heart to think that you could end up that way, so I pray

(Chorus)
It hurts me father, seein' your mi-nd can falter
We must be faltered, cause we pray, here it go-es

When I get out it's gonna be us, see?
Me, you, and G'jay& Jess, outta the family
At DZ, or wherever else y'all wanna go
I promise y'all, they won't seperate us no more, not in this life time
Ya know y'all mean the world to me, and nothin' more presious than my boys
And girl to me
Not even me, so when your wrong, I'm correctin' you
Cause if I don't, It's as good as negletin' you
Now this the truth, see I only want what's best for you
And if there's somethin' you can't do, I won't think less of you
Just try your best, I can see you got my ways in you
But I don't want you goin' through the same things I went through
See I was wild, even when I didn't have to be
That's why you always see them people comin' after me
But not no more, you see this change here had to come
I couldn't pasursize livin' down to my son...not to my son

(JT Hook x2)

(Chorus x2)

Boy, I just love spendin' time with you (that's right)
When you get older, I might even bust rhymes with you, if you want to
You know, you always make me proud of you (that's right)
No matter what the situation I'll go out with you
But I don't want you, to think that goin' to jail's cool
Just cause I didn't, boy you still gotta finish school, don't be no fool
See I went back and got mine, so if there's somethin' I wanna do, they can't
Stop mine
You know what I'm talkin' about, the people who make up excuses
Besides entertainment, labour sports, they think we're useless
But see the truth is in the good and when they puttin', whip on ya ass
When you get that money fast, you spend that money fast, boy
Everything you think you wanna do, I finally done it
See when I'm gone, everything I own, you gonna want it
And if you decide to settle down with a woman, make sure ya know her
It's cool to love someone, but don't be a sucker for her

(JT Hook x2)

(Chorus x2 to fade)Intro:  Luke

Awwwwwwwww, shit!  Ha ha, yeah!  Luke Records in the motherfuckin'

Fre-sh, Kid, Ice in the motherfuckin', house
*ak!*, Clay-vo-sie, just get on the mike and do what ya like!

Verse 1:  Clayvosie

'Vosie gettin' busy in motherfuckin' '93
Freakin' all the hoes and gettin' plenty pussy
So when it comes to hoes you call me Mr. Peepin' Tom
When you're home alone you might wanna gimme some
Then here I go creepin' in your window
Bend that ass over and I'ma fuck you like a dirty ho
You know I'm pimpin' all hoes in the '90s
The only place I want a bitch to stand is behind me
Cause I'm cool like that, with my big-ass gat
And my sawed-off pump in the back
For any nigga with beef in their fuckin' teeth
Wanna be like a player but you can't compete
So I be fuckin' hoes, and fuckin' up niggas
And still gettin' paid, so watch me get bigger
Brand new, on the scene with my nigga Luke
]From the bottom, niggas, so what you wanna do?

Chorus(4x):
["Let's take it to the stage, sucka!"]

Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice

Out of Chinatown, bitches on the dick
And I'm just rappin' to a Kid Ice flick
From a plate of rice to a pot of gumbo
I'll eat ya ass up cause it's time to rumble
Cause your bitch is on the dick cause of who I am
The Fresh Kid Ice, the Chinaman
Comin' from the bottom, straight to the top
Comin' clean and housin' your spot
Hoes, they love me cause they say I'm crazy
Since I'm runnin' 'round town, pluckin' them daisies
Whip ya whole ass when I fuck her
Cause I'd rather a bitch who'll kneel down and pucker
Luke put me down, and I come off
Since I fucked your ho, I'ma piss you off
Fuck with Chinaman, and you die
When my black bag open', gunshots run wild!

Chorus

Verse 3:  Debonaire

Well hey yo, I'm catchin' wreck
Chillin' by the projects, money got the high-techs
Goin' till the break o'dawn, never see bed
Get red when I said, got gats plus the (???)
Flip-time, better parlay in front o' me
I'm goin' out and showin' out shots from the uzi
Once again I'm here to buck the fate talk game
Magazines get picked like shirt to bloodstains
I'ma serve heat to the chumps who forget theyself
I'm steppin' back from the crowd and then it's on
I got the hand-skills for the county kid big man
So, money-grip, better chill with the ill
It's the Beatstreet, not the same Jay (?)
Home Team boogie down in the house and it's on
And ya don't stop, punk crews can't top this
Bad land's in the house (?) I'm out to rock it, Beatstreet!

Chorus

Interval:  Luke
Yo, it ain't nothin' but a lil' freestyle thing to do!  Home Team boogie in

Just swervin' and curvin' this thing.  Yo, JT Money -  tell these niggas
'bout some of that Rufftown Behavior!

Verse 4:  JT Money

Time to rip, money-grip, a nigga tired of waitin'
Pass the mic like Marino, I'll catch it like Mark Clayton
Yeah, it's that nigga
JT in effect, and my dick's gotten a lil' bigger
So I'm talkin' more shit in the Nine-Tre
Fuck the police, cause motherfuckin' crime pays
Peace to them hoes that suck dick
If you don't, go get hit by a truck, bitch!
I kicks the raw shit, not the flaw shit
Pull out my 4-5th, niggas hit the floor quick
Peace to Ram and my main man U-Y
If I could sing I would shooby-dooby-doo
While I might be rippin', nobody else is rippin'
Peace to the homies, fuck them niggas that be trippin'
Poison Clan niggas in the house, don't fuck around
Peace!  I'm out, comin' from Rufftown, nigga!

Cause a ho gon be a ho, nigga that's in the game
So all you niggas that be taking them out and buying thangs

So what the fuck? You'se a duck.  Nigga spend your flow
See I know you just want to say you fucked my ho
But that ain't shit cause I ain't never been a sucker
I'll let you have that ho, nigga I bet you I can still fuck her
Better recognizer, I'm the bitch-izer
Next time you see your ho your bitch'll have her thighs up
On a flick with this dick off inside her
Show you how to ride her
I'll make that pussy wider
You marks ain't got nathan for me
I'll make your baby mama leave you and tell you she love me
So who's the motherfucking man now?
You can never outdo me dawg and never understand why
This goes deeper than just dollars and cents
You keep breaking off them hoes and that money keeps getting spent
Cause I'm a pimp, now let me hear you say it

Plus I'm a pimp and I love all my bitches

[HOOK]* credited to Luke, as it appeared on his album of the aforementioned title

Intro: Luke

Yo, it's a fucked-up thing! I gotta bring Kid N' Play on this motherfuckin'
Album here, two pussy punk-ass niggas - yo, check this out, what I'mma do
Is I'mma go get last year's rookie of the year, JT Money of Poison Clan
This year's rookie of the year, Bustdown - yo, Bustdown, kick some of
That West Bank shit on these fuck niggas!!

Verse 1: Bustdown

Well, I'm first up as a rhyme conveyor
Luke Records in the house for the payback, player
Kid N' Play can suck a dick
Get me a mic and a 40 and let a real nigga wreck shit
To me you're walking on a tightrope
Instead of tryin' to be real, you're steady sweatin' them white folks
Keep runnin' your big mouth
But if you come to my hood, you'll get your asshole ripped out
Then I'mma play you to the back seat
Cause I'm runnin' more game than a track meet athlete
As if you didn't know, huh
You're dealing with a West Bank dicksman, ho
But anyway, I got a rhyme to deliver
Get your draws out your ass, quit frontin', my nigga
Cause if you don't, well you'll keep gettin dissed on
And if I see you at a show and you're slippin', you're gettin' pissed on

Chorus (4x):
[What about Kid N' Play?]
[Wick-wick-wack!]

Verse 2: JT Money

Now for starters, with kids I don't play
Cause y'all some fuck-ass, punk-ass, coochie niggas anyway
JT I the house, niggas, check it
Tryin' to diss my nigga Luke to sell your wack record
Let me talk about the Kid
I remember some ol' coochie-nigga shit you did
When we was up in New York
You was followin' Luke, talkin' 'bout "We gotta talk"
On that man's dick
Got your ass wide open and you're talkin' that bullshit
Both movies, I boo 'em
Cause you had hoes but you wasn't stickin' pipe to 'em
Thought they was fantastic
But through the whole fuckin' movie, Kid was gettin' his ass kicked
And 'bout that other nigga Play
He needs to get dissed cause he's a punk nigga anyway
Be 'round here kissin' hoes, while I'm dissin' hoes
And stabbin 'em with fishin' poles
You need to try to lay pipe in 'em
Oh, I forgot - punks don't like women
Got the nerve to try and diss somebody
At Jack the Rapper, you was hangin' 'round Luke's party
Now you're outta gas
With two motherfuckin' punk-haters on yo' ass
JT and Bustdown
Now let's see you ho niggas get tough now
Get the rubbers out your ass, dick-suckers
...and fuck them pussy motherfuckers

Chorus

Verse 3: Bustdown

Now let me put my boy Kid in his place
With them wick-wack rhymes soundin' like Rob Base
Cause if I have to come tag that ass
I'mma max, wax, tax and drag that ass
I get sharp like a ice pick
I'm on a hype tip, hold the mic tight as a vice grip
You couldn't deal with the concept
I'm collected and calm, but on the mike I'm a bomb threat
So motherfuckers get real
I got a heart like gold and a dick like steel
You wanna diss, punk? Please
You got a flat top thicker than commodity cheese
Luke left it up to me and JT
To take it from the bottom to the T-O-P
I saw your second "House Party," it figures:
Two house parties for two house-ass niggas

Outro: Luke

Two house motherfuckin' niggas - do y'all niggas know what a house nigga is?
A house nigga is a nigga who works in the house
Who cleans the master's ass, who cleans behind the master, who wash the master's ass
Y'all house niggas. I'mma field niggas, we field niggas here in Miami
That's why y'all niggas can't understand us, y'all fuck-niggas talkin' too much shit
Y'all niggas better watch what you sayin' cause y'all fuck niggas, y'all don't know
Y'all get fucked up here. Yo, check this out
Miami is closed to y'all niggas. Y'all barred. Y'all can't come here no more, fuck-niggas
Y'all can't sell no more records here
And if all real Niggas in the world is real like us, y'all don't buy them fuck-niggas' shit no more
Cause they ain't shit, pussy punk, fuck niggasMost rappers ain't nothing but niggas who talk a good one
Talking bout' they thugs, G's, and hustlas
Or they'll kill a nigga quick bout' some dumb shit
Get your mind right, I can tell you'se a young kid
Still a nigga see right through your game
I know it ain't no substance to your game
Trying to outdo the next nigga, claiming G
But all you rap ass niggas are the same to me
I gave you game for free, and I just call it like I see it
Say you real, well nigga be it
Nigga don't speak about it, be about it
Cause I'm the type of nigga to come through and see about it
Damn right, nigga kill with that camouflauge
Cause I know you as real as a damn mirage
You ain't really here
Talking that same shit, even though you only real as the game you kick
Rap ass nigga

Hook

Well if you go on and on til' the break of dawn
You a rap ass nigga
And if you hip the hop, the bee-bop don't stop
You a rap ass nigga
And if you fluent talking all that gangsta shit
You a rap ass nigga
And if you fit any one of those categories, boy you need to quit
Cause you a rap ass nigga

Motherfuckers think they can tell anything to a nigga
You got us fucked up like liqour, pussy nigga
Cause you got a big budget, thank you can drop anything on the public
And we gonna love it
Naw playa, it don't work that way
Keep playing, fuck around and get hurt that way
Shit, I feel like a lot of niggas owe me cheese
Got me wasting my bread on these wack cd's
Niggas might as well only sell singles
Get out the game and go do commercial jingles
For Kool-Aid, Pringles, or some other shit
Rap ass niggas just make a nigga sick
Can't hold in my beat no mo'
If I try you, then I might blow
But it might slow, down in the bottom
Rap ass niggas need to fall like harder

Hook

I'm on a roll like shit paper
Getting cheese while these other niggas get vapors
All for me, but my game go beyond this
Thats the reason other motherfuckers join this
I mean jealous nigga, when you look upon this
All you see is greatness and wanna harm this
But see you harmless, so find someone to play with
You out your league, fucking with this heavy-weight shit
With all that fake shit
I'm flowing really scary huh
Barely to you niggas who clown like Jim Carrey huh
Flows vary from bass to that funk shit
Got you open, cause I'll never join your punk shit
Motherfuckers on the jock like they want dick
Copy cats hear their flows and get so sick
Beat downs all you fuck niggas gonna get
For even thinking you can sit on my chrome bitch

HookJT Money:

I got a problem with this punk ass bitch I know
Ol' no good skanlezz switch out ho
An untrustworthy bitch like delilah
Only thing she good for is puttin' dick inside her, mother fuckin' face
Bitch got some good neck
But the little trick need to learn some respect
She made me beat her ass
Take a nigga out this game
See I don't beat my hoes cause all my hoes is payin'
But this one act like she don't understand
You is the bitch, me, I'm the man
Remember dat shit, then learn to submit
And that when you stop gettin' your funky ass kicked little hard headed
Trick
See a nigga know about ya
And I know a dollar bill 'll bring tha ho outcha
Then you got the nerve to claim you better than the rest of my hoes
When you ain't even in the rankin' of the best of my hoes

Chorus: Somethin' about pimpin'
That makes me love this game
Somethin' about pimpin'
The hoes be off the chain
Somethin' about pimpin'
I just don't wanna stop
Somethin' about pimpin'
Cause this players gotta keep a fat knock

Too Short:

I'm like JD Walker
Pimp hat to tha right smooth talker
Bitches workin' all night like a stalker
Gettin' every last nickel dime and quarter
Pimpin' ain't hardly nuthin' new to me
Used to be a little kid watchin' movies
I knew what I wanted in life, about nine or ten hoes
I ain't want no wife
I used to walk real cool like my leg was broke
And I still do, now I get paid from hoes, Beeitch
Cuz this East side nigga don't care
Since I was nine years old I been a player
And now I got a lot 'o women
It's never endin'
It's just somethin' 'bout this pimpin'
Chorus

JT Money:

Now, one time for you H-Os
You wanna try a real player bout his pesos
Hey hoes, I know you in this game tryin' to come up, pick a come up
Got these niggas got they nut up for some cut ups
So wut up all I wanna do is get this money witcha
I'm dead serious, I ain't tryin' to be funny witcha
I teach tha game but It ain't for free
When I see you with some change you just bring it to me
See you can come up in this game
And you can get hurt ho
When you in public just remember who you work for
Cause all them tight ? cats gonna come try to holla
So called ballers, flashin' they dollars
Hatin' J baby, you just play it crazy
Let him spend his loot on them boobs
So you can pay
All I want is the bread
He want the pussy and head
Don't be misled just remember everything I said
Beotch

Chorus Until End[Big Gipp]
Hey, enough
I know you're not gonna be all lame and choose
My house in Atlanta is what made you, you
You ain't never had nothin' till I paid the dues
My word is gold, I lay the rules
Why you trippin' on a brother about the things he do
Look, work can never matter how I got the loot
But you never hesitate when you drive the coupe
I made you ball, ain't that truth

[Monica]
I never asked for that much
If you stay, I laid here at night
Down at the gentleman's club
Seems like you can't get right
I knew when I saw the g's
You would be harder to please
You wanted more than enough
That's when it got too beat up

1 - [Monica]
Last time I was down for you
I though you really wanted to
Don't know how much pain it took
To put up that cash up on your boots
See I'm sick and tired boy
You can't even drive the cars
Sometimes I don't know what to do
What am I worth to you babe?

[Majic]
Yeah, yeah
See I'm in the Accolade
Coming through ride alone with flakes
The street's my home, up in the zone
Search a nigga's car tryin' to get my bone
Get my name, wear that thang
I don't know but I'm searching man
Lookin' for that sweet lick
No time for no cheap chick
I'm working

2 - [Monica]
You must believe
I gotta get you out of the streets
I disagree when you tell me that you're doing it for me
Just lean on me
I know you're in a little to deep
I gotta do what I gotta do to get you back here with me

[Monica]
I like the cash and all that
But I just can't watch my back
And if they catch me with you
Who knows what they wouldn't do?
You've spent too long in this game
My baby you gotta change
Before I lose you for life
I want to be your wife

Repeat 1

[JT Money]
See babygirl I gotta hustle
See I'm used to getting mine off the muscle
Everything that I do, I did for us two
Getting' mine on the grind is a must too
Plus you want all them finer things
I bought a compact, clothes, a diamond ring
Everything's on paper, they keep me on the caper
If it ain't about bread then I'mma holla at you later, baby

Repeat 2 (2x)

[Monica] (JT Money)
Out of the streets, streets, streets, streets, streets
(What? Yeah it's on three, it's on four, it's on five)
Out of the streets, streets, streets, streets, streets
(Yeah Southwest, uh, uh, uh)
Out of the streets, streets, streets, streets, streets
(I ain't never gonna stop)
Out of the streets, streets, streets, streets, streets
(Y'all know what it is)

Repeat 2 till end
