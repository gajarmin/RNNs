[Hook]
I am the one, don't run your tongue
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

[Verse 1]
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate
Hey, young boy had to penetrate
Face, young boy done caught a case
Bang, now his mama living with the pain
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay
They don't get the best of me so he regenerate
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state
Denzel Curry is the new candidate
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus
Bitches be bopping it, bow down and popping it
Dropping it in her esophagus
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it
Girl, I can make you a star
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist
Ripping through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm living so harmonious
Feeling like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics, bitch, I'm ultimate

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is is he fake, is he real
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I’ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Dropping melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I’m the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I’m the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I’m an animorph
Bitch, I’m a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fucking with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better love something than get a degree
This for lord infamous so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches looking thirsty, riding through the dirty
Like it’s mandatory, ending of the story

[Hook][Hook: Denzel Curry & Robb Bank$]
Nigga Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
Nigga we don't take kindly to threats
Bitch S.S. be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
We don't take kindly to threats
Nigga Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
We don't take kindly to threats
Bitch S.S. be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
Nah we don't take kindly to threats

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Slide for the free, kill for the fee
Pull out the stick then I pull out the ski
Put a motherfucker face on a white tee
That's what a nigga get being P.I.E
Sweet, nigga you D.I.E
Sleep, motherfucker that's six feet
Deep, no tender, no love, no care
But a nigga here still gon' creep
T.L.C. put it to ya Lisa Lo' that's a nigga left
Eye, kill a nigga, get ghost, that
Patrick Swayze, come equipped with a vest
I'mma point that shit to your motherfucking neck
K's all in my trunk
So you best to get a chopper
It's nothing but goon action
I ain't talking Waka Flocka
That 2.7.5. goons
Bout' to do a fucking Gank
Bumping Waka Flocka Flame
In a underwater tank
Cause nigga die right now
Bullet or a fucking shank
Niggas always tryna' be
The hardest in the fucking paint

[Verse 2: Yung Simmie]
Never take kind to the threats
I be off for your neck 'for you reach for the TEC, Simmie
Niggas gon' hear me then fear me, feel me?
Whole bunch of green in my Philly, turn up
Whole bunch of niggas if you run up
Tryna' act hard with your gun up, I shoot your son up
Grinding till the sun up, middle finger flashed
That's a one up, I'm a young gutta
Dog I mutter, Curry said cut 'em with his butter
Leave them boys wet like water
Off with his neck, posted with the set
I don't take kindly to threats, take kindly to threats
Ratchet for life, I'm hood, tryna' smoke bad but I’m good
Bust a nigga head for the cake
Jumping over gates can't wait
Nine to the face, fuck nigga you ain't safe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$]
Savage life nigga
You don't wanna see me live
Pop more than a quarter, so tell that dime piece
"Bitch, don't kill my vibe", man
I know your bitch love me
I know your bitch want me
She let me pillow pet that kitty
When she climb under this Snuggie
Bitch, South Florida
I only smoke mid in Broward
But end the flame of that Magic Dragon
And kill that Charmander, bitch
Gone on you niggas
Two phones on you niggas
Think I made it?
You don't wanna see me ball on you niggas, bitch

[Hook][Hook 1: Denzel Curry x2]
Told her it's an Ice Age
With a cold blooded nigga like me (I'm cold)
Tell that bitch I'm Rick James and a nigga really wanna super freak

[Hook 2: Denzel Curry x2]
I just wanna fuck
I just wanna smoke my blunt
I don't give a fuck about these bitches man
Cause they all want a nigga that stunt

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Let me tell you niggas about the game
Only get the pussy, fuck a name
Bitches never really have a face unless she sucking on your dick
Putting jizz in the food chain
Blow up the pussy like Hussein
Bitch look at me crazy like who sane?
Got fire, designer, I got the lighter, igniter
As I'm burning the back of the Mary Jane
Anakin Skywalker flame
Lord Vader kush surrounding my brain
Forizzle ? homies with the shizzle my nizzle
Doper than nickels that sprinkle over the cane
Melissa is like my little thang
Most hoes, can't say the same
Piping the pussy and maybe biting the cookie
Honey love ain't shit but I just came
Jizz boss
Make her drink the cum sauce
Bring her ass to my world
But this might have her ass lost
Nowadays, pussy have a cost
Never let the devil in like Ross
Curry the killer, the nigga, call me Jizzila
Just keep it pimping, my nigga, so Jizzwalk

[Hook 1]
[Hook 2]

[Verse 2: Mike Dece]
Kush smoke all I see
Eyes open, all three
Got her wetter than some Hi-C
On my golden dick, I'm icy
I got your whore so horny
Bring me anything that I need
She's a long dick addict
Prostitute her cause she love me bitch
Bitch I'm in need of that paper
Iced up as fuck, fuck equators
Heat that shit up, it vapor
Icy, stay icy, I quake her
Such a whore I cannot chase her
She bring that shit back as I make her
She fuck with my dollars, I'm making her holler
I beat that bitch up, yes I blaze her
Cold blooded and blooded debaser
L-E-A-Ning, no chaser
Is needed, I skeet on her face or
I'm proper, I fuck her, see you later
You bitch, erase her
Getting that ho out of here
She's nothing, don't need her
Always keep my pistol right here

[Hook 1]
[Hook 2][Intro]
Heaven
Nostalgic 64
Welcome, welcome, welcome

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
This is dedicated
To the memoir of my niggas, them
Most of them victimized because the daily grind
Crackers be bamming and sending them
Down to the county
Face down on the pavement
Blackland, Carol City
My visual it's the same shit
Still the same little niggas going to the candy lady
25 for that frozen cup
Crackers be thinking they trapping
Just post in the Charger until they are ready to jump
Jump out the jumper, no pulling your gun out
You better be sprinting the other way
Throw out the fire, get caught by the nine
Run through alley ways all in Cherry Bay
It's real in the field, either kill or be killed
Like BG so they got a grip on the tec
Took my nigga, Chynaman, took my nigga, PJ
And Trayvon, hot damn, who next on a white tee?
Born and raised on the Zone 3
Blackland right by the 199
Pull out the stick if you 'bout that life
Seen niggas from the Four be toting that iron
Run down, catch a nigga by sundown
Or downtown when he think the shit is serene
Got that boy when they shot that boy
Then they put him in the trash when they slide by the Beanz
Swerve, soon as I peel off the curve
Burn the evidence then a nigga hide
Take 27? Nah nigga, fuck that
Let's take that chance on the I-95
Bumping that sickest shit with the vomit spit
And a 666 with a twist and twirl
If you survive homicide drive-by
They'll leave you with nubs like the Powerpuff Girls
I get so high, stay so high
Until I see the face of God
Welcome to South Florida
Let that AK rip on the whole damn squad
Bitch

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm from that Zone Three, Zone Three
Zone Three, Zone Three

Cash out I'm ballin' to the end of me
My enemies mother fuck my enemies
Cause I'ma keep ballin' to the end of me
My enemies mother fuck my enemies
Cause I'ma keep ballin' to the end of me

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Up in Carol city me and lotto in the charger when we slide to deep (to deep)
Can't fuck with the south with a AK-47 bumping T double-D (double D nigga)
First 48 gotta say it one time r.i.p. my nigga Bizzle (Bizzle Bizzle)
Kick drill ravish of a nigga think he savage turn him to a popsicle
Thats ice...cold
Or my last name ain't 3000
Bad ass bitch on my t.i.p. she wet like an everlasting fountain
Still a hot boy [?] or wayne like a mother fucking carter
Niggas water whipping in the hot damn kitchen like a nigga avatar or katara
Remember[?]
It still fuck the other side, lurking all black like that boy plies
Snapping like a fat ho at the popeyes when she don't get the thigh, the chicken, or the fries
So nigga what it be?
I can turn my shirt to a ski
Fuck feds, not even ice T wanna come and ice me
Like its new jack city, shit looking grim no mandy, billy
Cross the chopper line bitch you better bow down to a nigga greater than yourself...trick
Flow is immortal so therefore I[?] some of it in yourself...trick
From the tre deuce, got to keep a deuce deuce like a nigga lurking in south central
Bruh if you bout that pressure cross that line, fuck nigga state your issue...
My nigga

[Hook]

[verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Behold these verses the stars to the churches will all metamorph into seven
Im rocking about 4 types of polo you peep that my style [?] Armageddon
Apocalypse stop, pop the clip better bow down now its all about power
Fantasy darker then Swishers the wicked demented get hit with the mystical shower
Now thats dan-ger grab on the ban-ger
Take down the empire bruh
In the hood just robin like William's
Lets hope that they'll never doubtfire
Niggas be knocking no cabbage no UPS person
So tell me whats up with the S
Slithery snakes with they slithery tongues
Salivating salvations with shit on your head
Yes Curry gone mash on these cowards[?]
Put shells to they back like they bowser,spit fire no flower
Get smoke like the OG and sour then head up to Broward
You know when the bass turn up louder
Bout loud as the dro, get to the door
I'm shroomed out my mental like Mario Bros
I'm seeing the walls start to kaleidoscope
So im guessing that already means [?] I'm gone
Its quiet striking that, haters won't tell the truth in front of your face
Not the same time, not the same place so they hate from a greater distance far way
You see them in person look 'em in the eye
And they say that that wasn't the case
Y'all can suck a dick in advance
Like Rich Homie Quan, get the fuck out my face...bitch

But she wanna bend over
Denny, I'm a supernova
Flat nights make you stronger
Feelin' like a double O yeah
Feelin' like a double O yeah

[Verse 1]
Denny Cascade, rollin' wit a green AK
Ain't Eazy, like I'm bumpin' Dre Day
But a nigga ain’t cray
Denny got the answers, no Ye
But when the white comes I Sway
Niggas be prey
Slaves to the ways everyday
Save a ho, S curled in the cape
Doggin' these hoes
Nigga raw doggin these hoes, until the bitch say she's late
Bitches on my dick, purple weed like Prince
Better tell these hoes, bitch I ain't Clark Kent
Denny Cascade charge hoes like rent
Bumpin' triple-6 chiefin' while I'm shining moonlit
In a Cadliac, splat
Puff on the doja, the thraxx
Pushin', she burn, the cat
Beat the pussy up all the way to the max
I beat the pussy up all the way to the mat

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay the moon is out, blunt is lit
Ride around (?) fuckin' the baddest bitch
Divin' in the portal cuz we splashin' in
You know the captain is...Denny Cascade
Mr. Universe, gangster

All my bitch wanna kiss like cankers
Get your hoes like lookin' up a chaser
But if you need that it, I got it
Presidential new Reaganomics
Break it down smoking on the chronic
It's the shaman, Denny Cascade
And you know it's me, come with me
Fried as the lock on the Aqua Teen
Purple the galaxy I can see
But this is how truly you know it's me[Hook]
Lord Vader Kush
Staying all black
Niggas wanna be with it in a gang
Roll up on a sucker hit him with the click clack

Fuck niggas envy me cause i'mma ball

Fuck niggas they envy me cause i'mma ball
6 man shawty I'mma baller util I fall
(bitch)

[Verse 1]
I put them L's in the sky, like a niggas thinking I'm Jésus
Arnold Schwarzenegger any nigga chillin' with her
Black bitch fuck around her might erase you
Flat land bounce that I walk on
Sometimes I never seem to walk home
47th Ave down 17th Ave like Rudy Tabootie in a Chalk Zone
All Chicago niggas got 30's
Dade county got K's
Carol City nigga from the route, in a stadium start shit in a 3-2 lane
From [?]
I can show motherfuckers that feel my pain
Uzumki upon the terrain
Niggas killing niggas over bitches but my nigga this ain't the Django Unchained
Shot like Jamie Foxx got the neighborhood watch thinkin' they the fuckin' cops
Shoot a nigga pop, pop, pop
Everybody gets all Innocence [?]
Time to expose all of the god damn half knots
Curry, how does the [?] and the weaponry
Risen from nothing but short hand built legacy
Honestly it would be down to endevour me
[?]
[?]
Betcha Rozay ain't never ever heard no shit like this (huh)
New age of the Ice Age, Kent Clark from this Carol city life shit
Betcha Rozay ain't never ever heard no shit like this
New age of the Ice Age, Kent Clark from this Carol city shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Running getting wicked while I'm bumpin' Biggie
Who is the wickedest infidel you ever saw
Split the blunt in half with a lightsaber staff
Fertilize it with dab in half [?] ever saw god
Age ice age, I'm a whole [?]
Stand out with super models in a room with Chris Bosh
C9 is the future and my gang be bosh
[?] niggas stop the reality [?]
Cause my point 0, next episode
Give em the chronic that let em' explode
D-O double Jizzle it's a dog eat dog world [?]
Legendary singer, Will Smith
That's the both sides I'm a walking talkin' spliff
On another level nigga I'm a [?] you a chef
Like meet me in the shopping you better get a grip on life
Killa clan destined  looking for lotto and astral projection
On the other side with a jesus piece flexin'
Like [?] mr fanastic in my bed and [?] i'm breathin'
Inhale exhale
Looks like I'm calling Jehovah on the Nextel
On the 3-2 Avenue to fuck with Denzel
As the rest of the virus falls [?] with this hell
I say
Betcha Rozay ain't never ever heard no shit like this (huh)
New age of the Ice Age, Kent Clark from this Carol city life shit
Betcha Rozay ain't never ever heard no shit like this
New age of the Ice Age, Kent Clark from this Carol city shit

[Hook][Verse 1: Denzel Curry]

Got me feeling like a fucking dog, it's outside

[Verse 2: Yoshi Thompkins]

Feel like I got the power, I'm Higher the hip hop messiah
I ain't fuck Alicia Keys but a nigga on fire
That's prior to the fact that I'm rawer then unprotected sex
Eat some Chex cereal in the morning and then it's off for checks
And why niggas asking me to match spliffs
I'd rather stay home, break backs like Mike Smith
I'll write a cool mixtape drop it on Dat Piff
Now these hoes tryna' use me I'm feeling a little thrift
Damn Josh you Rap now, but I ain't talking about gifts
And I ain't talking about cliffs when I say I leave you hanging
Cause you bitches got the blues like a smurfet if you banging
And I ain't banging I'm just banging these hoes niggas claim they taming
I'm always rappin burning up like coal
Aiming at you hoes
Women that don't have no fucking souls their hearts a fucking cold
Mines is bared ass on a igloo
So don't ask me do I care about these bitches and what they
All do cause uhm
They probably what I'm getting through
Rapping fucking hoes it helps me with what I'm getting through
Getting super wet and lay the pipe like a plumber do
The name getting known so these bitches sticking like some
Glue, Ima ball cause a nigga shine more than a car being waxed
Bought some armorall hoho, get off my santa clause
Class writing rhymes cause I don't have time for this work shit
Probably high as fuck ? weed I'm talking purp shit
Teacher passing out D's so yes I'm barely passing
But I'm worried about the fashion and the bitches in which
I'm smashing, Bust a nut and drop her off and then I dump her like
Some ashes, like sorry Mr.Johnson for this math I have no passion
I'd rather make sweet love to the girl that sitting next to me and flip
Her like a supreme deluxe Krabby Patty recipe
They like dam josh how come you haven't blown yet
Because I haven't kissed enough ass to get known yet, dummy

[Verse 3: Jk The Reaper]

Niggas swear they get pussy but having phone sex
Tell her give me head til' her forehead dome sweat
Meat cleaver flow for niggas thinking they raw
Leave you looking like DMX if you keep barking at the dogs
Check her call log, I bet you nigga I ain't call at all
To me it's 100 miss calls check her crib you'll probably find my
Draws, and one of my balls
Why niggas always stall, I'm that nigga on call with three bitches, ho I'm Jabber Jaws
And with the pussy cat doll, check my catalog dog
My catastrophic bombs'll probably throw you off
Niggas always coming soft, so I had to flip the script
I think I'm Da Vinci hiding images inside the script
Watching tales from the crip, lay my spread and then I dip
Say she want to take a trip well here's yo shroom take it
Have her seeing hyenas and shit, like a safari
I'm on safari you should google me bitch
Before I put this google chrome and show yo ass some digital shit
I say it straight to yo face, no subliminal bitch
I slide through like I'm gumby
It's like Return of the Mummy, shit'll get ugly
Cause niggas in the field, no rugby
Bitches want to fuck me, tell her that she lucky if I touch thee cunty
I was probably riding out on my huffy, one deep
Riding through these streets like I ain't me, I'm a wolf
Nigga and you lookin like a black sheep
You would make a nice shirt, but it's too hot for the long sleeve
You looking cotton soft, I feed you to my offspring, fuck you

[Verse 4: Mike Dece]

What the fuck you need bitch, never sold a copy
I sell rocksies and I clean shit
Cleaner than crispy, sort of like Whitney you O.D. bitch
Inhaling and smoking on shit that's so potent it's making me see shit, she's praising my cum like it's Jesus
I stay with the green, its too filthy for the OZ if it
A forest of trees, smoke so thick I can not breathe in it
Who's working like me bitch?, I'm taking your millis' like Ri just did
When ? but, playing these games will not give you shit, and neither
Will we, but the drugs set you up with a gun to your lips
I'm high as can be so, I do not really give a shit like toilet to pee, just like humsy and bill which i say with a brick, so fuck the police, sort of like bops on the cops they can suck my dick, not literally, ho
Said I'm cliche so I spray on her tits, she ice and she gliss, she's covered in jizz, killing these bitches like several disses, I leave them
Exquisitely killed in the trenches, like water they wet
?
You want some pills, I got tanks I got bells
Yes I know I'm killing you, but I have to pay the bills
Ho, I got sticks like a fucking stick drill
?
Cut these faggots up like some fucking fish scale
Colored beam pointed at the demons where they dwell
Kill a faggot cop, send his ass back to hell[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Up on the Three Two Ave
I wake up every morning tryna figure out how to start my day
I go to the bathroom, then take me a piss
Brush my teeth now it's time to parlé
I call up B Money to open the crystal it's time to go jet so I skate (open the door nigga)
I'm rolling and blousing, coughing these ounces, these money roll a whole 28
Took 8 grams
Bumping 99' jams reminiscing on the town last week
Talk about a cop cherry tops run a block
In a hotbox saying the youngin' had heat
Spur of the moment the youngin' was dumb as he dropped from a fatal attack
On the 207 called  9-11, hit 15 bullets to his back
Shit got whack
Everybody really on that but you just got to embrace it
Even on the tracks just like it's braces
Murder got this Carol City in cases
Face it, you get wasted like it's GTA
But this ain't no Grove Street and you ain't CJ
Nigga

(News Intermissions)[Intro]
Zheep
Nothing To it
How i do it

[Verse 1: Black Zheep Dz]
Word up
Say That Zheep there thats a smooth young bucka
Never fuck with them suckas
You Want beef? Thats what the dogs crave
So on sight you supper
When they pull up no tint
With the cameramen, Down to make a horror flick
Out of you niggas with these clips
And I just caucasianed the whip
So my new ride be my new bride , Killa
Feeling like Kaiba, Yeah my bitch got blue eyes
Now I'm a fucking walkin drug that all these women wanna hit
Got a face your ho can love and yet a flow you can't forget
And now I'm trynna get a emmy
Round the time I cop a Fendi printed semi
And a matching bucket hat
So I can where that with strap
At all cost, Not in my blood to fuck with frauds
If I get crossed you get your Face crossed, Like Benoit
Mannnnn, I Floss through the party
Pitchin product to the Shawty,s
Never thought of popping Molly's
Addicted to popping shotties on my enemies though
Flipping homegrown greenery
Got the room like a chimney
Now my wrist is singing symphonies(I'm out chea)

[Hook]
Push this shit to the limit
Cause the sky, it ain't high enough
So I do what these niggas don't
Love it and live it up
Watch all the Crabs in the bucket do them
I'm Doing Justice
For one, Oh Im not to be fucked With!
BITCH!

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Bullets multiply, like a mogwai in water
My nigga keep that lightsaber rolling up master Yoda
You ready to sprint when them bullets by your ear, Motorola
Aquarius not your average Joe, When you facing these cobras
And thats Slytherin, they slither in, when you open the door
My .38 full of falcon punches turning a serpent to Gryffindor
Kamehameha waves in the clip of that K
So I keep that falcon punch inside that .38, word to Richard
Them seven shots niggas will hit you, brother I'll lynch you
Yeah, that be the sickness
Niggas be victims off a lynching
Mr.Till for instance
Be The prime like Optimus
I came in this bitch
And I dropped the shit
Yeah really a bowel
Moving in the belly of an infant
Murder paragraphs and sentence
These rappers is on my shit list
Get the Gist bitch
So listen
That means real recognize real
Niggas claim that they trill
Yall the niggas I want to kill
(Like That)

[Hook][Intro]
I do this for my niggas
I do this for myself
Enter my mind
That's all I can say nigga

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Five in the morning turn to six
My life has turned into a bitch
With the fucking wettest clit in the galaxy
Rapidly tripping and rapping and snapping
And killing my niggas that coming through blasting
And looking for money and looking for magic
We sticking together like metal and magnets
Lutrashious
Me and Mercedes up in the condo
On the phone for 9 months, we sparked the conver-sation
Enter the void, mind escaping
Racing
Plus my heart rate went blazing
Ganja
As I ponder on graduation
Threats hit a nigga the points where I could make it
Not a contract could take what I created
Not on paper my clan name erased it
Down nigga since day one, I never hate shit
Same nigga tat 275 on the pavement
Got highs and lows on one path of greatness
18 years live life larger than basic
Marquis, Andrew, Darnell, etcetera
Its still my niggas, know things will get better but
Things take time, and all things change
Some people venture off and make they own lane
But the place is just the same from the F.L.A
But my cuzzo Chynaman got hit with the 8
From the clip
And my nigga William had his last trip
When he hung his self in his room, roll up the spliff
As I puff one, puff two for my niggas
Then three for the niggas that be hating
Nigga I don't care
Aquarius Killa, the Mack
Talk your girl up out her underwear
Let me bite that pussy like a god damn juicy bear
Suicidal thoughts I'm on my head to make it clear
Another life in day, hallucinate got me in my rear
Lamborghini dreams, Freddy Krueger is my shooter
Raider still the klan but C9 is the future
Bitch

[Outro]
Synthesize, and realize, that life's no game
Synthesize, and realize, that life's no game
Synthesize, and realize, life's no game
No game
No game
No game
I should have said it's no game
No game
No game
No game
Synthesize, and realize, life's no game
Synthesize, and realize, life's no game
No game
Synthesize, realize, life's no game
Synthesize, realize, life's no game
(Game over man)[Intro]
Raider Klan, strictly for my Raiders
A life in the day as
Denzel Curry

[Verse 1]
Okay, it's five in the morning
Cracking of dawn and I'm yawning
As I just reminisce when me and my cousin used to roll a swish
Pussy ass niggas they act like a bitch
They say I wasn't gonna be shit
Cause they words I choose to use was just so damn articulate
I paint a picture
With the scripture my father gave me
Went to yelling niggas and bitches and how you wouldn't play me, but
After my granny passed that's when a nigga grew heartless
Run up in the nigga house and shoot the shit like target
Get it, with a pen and a pad I was quick with it
Laying down on the back end so me and my niggas could rip it
But by then, we broke up
Reality hit and I woke up
Each and every day I take a smoke and I would choke up
Now it's over
I keep a conscious mind ever since I went sober
Stopped speaking of happy times, I wasn't in Range Rovers
A few months later I had a chat with Dece
Yeah Mike Dece, a real Posh OG
Talking about this rapper that came out the CC
Carol City's own folk, yeah I'm from the Zone 3
Simmie, well Andrew
Straight out of Myrtle Grove
Came a fan to a friend, Raider Klan across the globe
People raising eyebrows
Think my songs is devilish
Know it's quite rebellish
Plus my talent's heaven sent inferno
Creeping with the flame so they can burn dro
Or probably in the Jaguar, bumping while they ride slow
Now listen
No need for the hating niggas
Wasn't here before but then arrived so you a fake nigga
Now my Facebook and Twitter's full of compliments
They scream Aquarius Killer, now triumphant, then accomplishments
That's as far as I got on my verse

[Hook]
Synthesize, realize, life's no game
Synthesize, realize, life's no game
Synthesize, realize, life's no game
Synthesize, realize, life's no game
La la la, la la la, la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la, la la la
A life in the day of Denzel Curry[Intro]

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I ride down 27 with a mixed bitch
Looking like LisaRaye
My bitch is in the passenger
Like dracula and Carmen Hayes
Who blow me like cocaine
With a little propane
King of the Hill
I keep it real
She drop that top like Rogaine
So slide wit ya boy
If you ain't talkin bout Benz
Then i dont wanna ride with ya boy
Come over here get high with ya boy
Glide with ya boy
Side with ya boy
I do it how i wanna do it
Run that pussy Carl Lewis
Now she thinking she my wife
Oh my god, are you stupid
Talkin about all i need is love and affection
But baby im a *dog barks*
And i am not the type to mess with
Im cruisin in that Lexus
With a chick named Alexis
And later in the night
She gone earn herself
A pearl necklace

[Hook X2]
Im that, Im that, nigga so
Fall back, fall back
And you don’t really
Want that, want that
Cause you ain’t really
On that, on that
I told my baby

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I'm that nigga countin figures
Bumpin to that 69
Your bitch on that ecstasy
That ??? grind
Drinking off of dollar signs
She all on the dick
And she clappin her thighs
Finesse at expense
With my face on her breasts
And she poppin that pussy
Just like a .45
Now, when i recline
I'm in my zone
Bitch nigga i'm fine
Bruh bruh just vibe
She done with her twerking
Damn she tired
Ride, i told ya chick lets slide
In order to dive in the passenger
A nigga just had to just fuck with her mind
Dick and desire in her temple
Now she thoughts are caught in her mental
Now she wants to ride my beep
Like singers ride instrumentals
But i bump that little key
And she told that girl to bust it
Man she do it like a stripper
When she lay it down and then touch it
So rub it, similiar to vapor rub
For your chest, make those panties
Tsunami, mixed with false Viagra wet
Now it's a family reunion
When my mini-me is down her neck
Rubbin Miagi, a curious killer
That nigga that never take kindly to threats

[Hook]

[Outro]
Benz Benz
Bitch i got a Benz
Benz Benz
Bitch i got a Benz
Benz Benz
Bitch i got a Benz
And i got them Bands
So im makin Ends
Bitch i got a Benz
Bitch i got a Benz
And i got them Bands
So im making Ends
Bitch i got a Benz
Bitch i got a Benz
And i got them Bands
So you know im making Ends[Hook]
Bitch, that's a bitch named bitch
Got your bitch and my bitch
That's a bitch named bitch [X4]

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I'm running down the fucking universe
In a purple vert, pink flame
Playing while a nigga diggin in her skirt
Switch it up, take her to the back
Like I do with her, splurging
Yeah girl I know you're not a virgin
So twerk it
After I work it baby you're worthless
Curses, but my dear I'm just blurring
Roses, just turned a nigga into Moses
Any given reason I open up in the ocean
I'm stroking, playing slow motion
Juvie, who me? All up in her head like a kufi
Ooh wee, Diddy Cascade is a cool G
Realest nigga ever I meditate on mount Fuji
With a lady that resembles Lauryn Hill
Welcome to my world, the red and blue pill
Morpheus, really wanna know just what you're working with
We chop it up, we break it down
And then we never work again

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
Root of all evil
Woke up in a Martin car, my chain look medieval
Leandoer, bitch, I’ll thrash her like a Weavile
Money in the needle, Glock empty, re-load we know
Drop-top in the whip fucking bad bitches
[?], I'm the 5th beatle, talking is my detail
Yung Lean a young fetal, smoking loud in the cathedral
Half an ounce of lethal, half an ounce of peaceful
Glock to your head, pop goes the weasel
Half an ounce of lethal, half an ounce of peaceful
Glock to your head, pop goes the weasel
Dank got me flying over state, counting stacks is paper
Where my mind running circles, certain
Intoxicated, leave your luck to faith
No need to negotiate
Hide the dead bodies so we count the weight

[Hook][Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Riding down the strip, bumping to some Pac (Pac bitch)
Nigga get the shot from the double Glock
Gun play nigga, it's that Triple C
Coming out hard, it's that MJG
Slide with the Klan, bitch you better not slip
Caught his ass slipping from the full clip
Grill that motherfucker, let that AK rip
T.I.P., bitch I got them sticks like TIP
Fuck a Burger King, if a nigga want beef
Bang bang on a bitch, like I'm Chief Keef (bang bang)
Bitches got pressure, lay a nigga six feet
R.K. all day, catch a motherfucker that's on the creep
Niggas is poppin', so death is your option
Your body gets shot till your brain is in fronted
I cut it, I chop it, you niggas is droppin'
A bullet is knocking, is harder to snuff
Run from the gauge, or run from the TEC
Really little niggas, you don't wanna see death
Really little niggas, you don't wanna see death
Really little nigga, you don't wanna see death

[Verse 2: Soulja Mook]
Strolling down the street, bumping that P, gripping that master beat
45 on my belt, you get dealt like niggas in Vegas be
Fuck that shit, I'mma hit 'em where it hurt
Knock a nigga out, then put him in a verse
Lay a nigga out, then put it on a shirt
Wrap up the tie, then put him in a hearse
Villainistic shit when I take your bitch and unload my clip
Everglades ride, let's take that trip
Cement shoes so your ass don't slip
Go and roe your boat, gently down the stream
I got snipers in the bushes that shoot like swat teams
Real nigga shit, I been 'bout mine
Killing these beats like I'm tote my nine
Yapping this shit like I bump on grind
BatKave nigga like I'm going kinda blind
Brooklyn shit, like we bikers nine
Terroristic coke, blowing on that dro
Nigga low key, no more
Bet I take your ho, till you show like a nigga ain't know
Home invade your door, express yourself like a lil bitch yo
I don't give a damn, nigga I go ham
Nah, I go hard as fuck, nigga you just outta luck
And take yourself, nigga tuck your chain
Fuck that shit, I'm bringing the pain ho[Hook: Mike G]
Tell me all of your true feelings
And what you wanna do with us
My crew made of true villains
If we shoot you should shoot with us
If you do that's my nigga
I got love for the real bitches
That there is the isn't it
Well thats what you consider

[Verse 1: Mike G]
[?], know i flow perfect
With out a purpose life must be worthless
And in any instance im with it forgive or forget
Tickets for a sentence they might end up missing
Im hurting
Those with no focus your mind must be open
Thats what i need most of them
Though others [?] follow
The voice of a generation [?]
Due to my level of elevation high
Hitman should be my new occupation
[?]
Nothing is gained if you never take risks
I plan to progress till we don't exist
I need you to listen, i dont need assistance
Just walk with a vision pursue a position
So what you go, let em know
Im the man now, stand down
Cause this might be your final chance last stance
[?] lap when i pass
Wave that checkered flag in a circle with my superman stance
Its a mean to an ends [?]
Then its sink or swim if you dont float
[?]
Loose leaf before i loose steam

[hook]

[Verse 2: Pouya]
Keep it calm and collect
She offered the neck
All for the set
Ok whats next
You rappers be acting suspect
Line em up, only mess with a few
Im riding around with my crew
And my driver is screw
You sit on a couch while im busing a move
Tell me im keeping the flow and she want to keep goin'
I feed the few
This how i do (this how i do)
You get goosebumps when i touch you
Baby bone 94
Do the math slowpoke
Fast stroke tip toe
Only 5 foot 4
With a 6 foot ho
8 foot stripper pole
Divided the dimes
Together they grind
Killing each other for money and diamonds
I really can't blame em
Get money for the kids when the day comes
Respect me the feelings is mutual
Been doing some things i really ain't used to
This lifestyle i gotta get used to it
Pussy bald like bruce willis

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
My girl shoot once but she never shoot twice
Shine like a dime nickel play that right
Ima keep it g try and play it like mike
Try and pull yo ho and fuck her on skype
Knock the pussy out thend send ya on sight
New slaves to the game to god which is I
E Y E, what do you see?
S T E V I to the E
So you wonder why this nigga so hot?
Cooking with the ice then you got me in a pot
That percy jackson, water whipping
Tossed sideways and the boat be tipping
Denzel ain't snitching
So brother keep listening
Me and shooter [and a baller that's a pistol and piston]
Never go rogue so i dont be lynching
Yellow gold in my teeth nicknamed bart simpson
Melissa its a real life [lisa]
[? bicycle jump[?] visa
Play for teh win we the highest you see us
Ask freddy kreuger because he dreamed us
C 9 O F S S
Why your girl think I got an S on my chest
Try and get saved i ain't loaded
Pull the trigger on the truth [?]­[Produced by D.K.A.D.]

[Intro: John Milton]
Let me give you a little inside information about God
It's my time now

[Hook: Deniro Farrar]
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit 'less there's 36 O's in the key
OG niggas call me big bruh
Knowing goddamn well that they older than me and
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit 'less there's 16 O's in a pound
New god flow
Nigga this that new god flow, y'all bitch niggas better bow down
I ain't worried 'bout shit

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Denzel with the L at the end of the noun
Makin' sure their child could see the cap and the gown
Too many lil niggas still runnin' around
Come face to face with the wild and that's the end of your child
Universe, gangsta is the god of the sound
From the planet of the nectar on the sea and the isles
Wanna see an angel dead? Let's walk a few miles
With a sword, halo, and a crown so round
Like root canal, in your mouth
Fuck around you get 40 cal
Bitch what the fuck is beef to a slaughterhouse?
Got sticks that'll knock your baby momma out
Scratch that, knock Harry Potter out
Hit his head on Obama's couch, nail Obama's scout
Y'all niggas is sauerkraut
When the villain bring the choppers out, then they call you out
Tell me what's that about? When you catch 'em then you ash 'em out
Get the money then I'm cashin' out
Really what is that about? What's that about?
My nigga, tsk tsk
Only shoot once it's a hit, and if you shoot twice it's a miss
My nigga bang bang
Fuck that, let his brains hang, nigga fuck that let his brains hang

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
36 O's in a brick, 16 O's in a pound
AK47 with the red beam and a drum on that bitch hold 150 rounds
Go on, ride with your squad
Nigga you could die with your squad, tryna get live with your squad
Young OG, nigga I'm a young OG
Get toe-tagged tryna play hard
And it's money over boppers
My young nigga's ex pill-popper, all of 'em ride with them choppers
Call a mortician, ain't no need for a doctor
Call a mortician, ain't no need for a doctor
Dead on arrival, yeah I said dead on arrival
Swear to God on a stack of Bibles
Headshot a nigga, reassuring no survival
Headshot a nigga, reassuring no survival
Cold heart nigga, that's how they raised me
Kill or be killed so you really can't blame me
Straight up the gutter where they killin' over words
Fuck around and get toe-tagged in front of your baby
Nigga get buck
Swear to God nigga get buck, first time let it be your last
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit send a murder gang at your pussy ass

[Hook]

[Break: Deniro Farrar]

[Verse 1: N3ll]
These niggas be clutchin, they postin the block, and be scared to pop
Drop another brother mother fuck a blackland

Shooters run up to keep me out the violence
Niggas be prowlin, you ain't even a component, opponents deceise every moment
So break yoself claimin you want it, you runnin up on it
You stuck up, you chicken, you boneless
See really ain't holy, rest in peace pj my nigga, you really ain't know him
You really ain't growin, smokin that ganja my nigga, you really ain't blowin
My niggas be totin, nigga you left and you hit
So get labled a snitch and you dumped in a ditch
You      like a bitch
Break yoself claiming you eatin I shouldn't give a shit
Nigga betta duck, drunk and he dont give a fuck
Clutchin and ready to bust, he never did trust
That nigga, done dissed and got rushed, he felt like he set that shit up
Now if you trynna buck, hittin the gate and got stuck
Where safe till that nigga ran up
And snitched on his plug, got stuffed and drugged through the mud
Left in a tub full of blood
These niggas dont tell, fuck up and tell on your self
You look like that nigga dat never sat up in a jail
Dem niggas so body frail, betta break yo self
I take yo health, gotta make this wealth
Quick wit it, niggas can't get wit it
Smokin and chokin exposin them bastards
I don't give a fuck and what
These niggas gone hate and these bitches they're nuts

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Living existences, personal prescription
You sippin this lean just to get you high
Stick in the air, aim at me if you dare
Ignorance is a bliss so I'm hopin you die
Niggas is niggas, so niggas have moments, and ended up leaving the synthesis
Total disaster, they'll kill if they have to with bullets and mayhem
And killin a bitch, Wasted in miami, where shit is uncanny
I'm hopin I'm livin past 21, Where is the drop, get the Glock and I pop
And the lean and gettin that nigga and gun
Consequence, consequence having no consciences
Leaving yo blood on the fuckin floor
This is reality makin no gratisy
Nigga it's Curry so open the door

[Verse 3: Rell]
Cruisin' round' in that black splat, with a mac ten got a hundred rounds attached
Run up on him with the funk and lay his ass flat
Talkin' stupid make them choppas go brapp brapp haaa
Young ass nigga chasin' scrilla get dat, pump to your gum
Make your fuckin face go numb, fuck nigga you don't want no beef
Fuck nigga you don't want no beef, any nigga wanna get it
He can get it black stick put that shit to his mothafuckin' fitted
And I ain't playin witcha', my niggas' come getcha', take a hundred rounds with ya
We blow on that dank, fuck nigga get stank, put that shit to his face
And blow out his brains, nigga you witnessin' real, put him in the field

He got 15 years, pussy nigga remember I got yo address
And I know where yo mama live, put a real nigga off in the field
An' all he know is kill, kill

[Verse 4: Willo]
This the real deal, bitch I bet you feel trill
Off in this thang from the south watch yo mouth cuz what we spit is kill, ill
Dade County 305 what you know about it ho?  In this thang we gettin change
And we just gettin rowdy yo, trunk music thump you better bump, toot it once
As you is, nigga we off in the business, we gettin the chiznits
Cuz we got to eat, you niggas can't get with me, I'm sickedly
Spittin this shit so quickedly, they can't get with me this is the
Recognize how we just apply this shit with a vibe and we gettin live
And you bitches is about to cry[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Who is that nigga that's intergalactically fucking all your bitches
He's snapping and chatting our home girl as she's sucking on my dizznick
God base, bad bitch, walk her to her sprinkle the substance
Dip on a dose of this pimpin equals submission at longer extension
My nigga you lame
Drug dealers be switching to Santa Claus instead of a cane
Nigga your memories are dropped
Denny Cascade better watch your brain
Fuck them other niggas mane
They're not I see, they depart
As they got me scattered brain
See my thoughts across the wall
Damn, and I'm an abyssal I'm more than a kid, so baby girl get the best of me
In and out and in and out can tell you my pimping legacy
Denny Cascade the universe is saying
Slumber in my bed post as I meditate and lay
Blowing that Luke Skywalker kush, Reflex under my nigga I could
And if this ain't my nigga you hood
Pu Pu Pu Pu
You dead or you shook
Damn, Real nigga still will kill niggas have you lying still nigga nah nah for real nigga, but went up your real figure

[Verse 2: Nell]
It's the notorious spitter, kicking it with my niggas
From the Vill ,tryna bill all my niggas can keep it real
My people sittin in cells placing robbery with a steel
Jumping numbers on every bail just so they can get out to kill
They arresting Lee Hart Infield living the life of a cotton mill
Enlighten by Christ so I see the wrong in my right
Every night he gone off the marijuana from Cali to Arizona
I get bad bitch, bonus she bitch I hit
Homies gotta take you by the edge no stitch and give
Donors (daily)
Niggas on my side play crazy
It's new fake shot to wanna roll me the Glock
Drop it, but me Imma do it like the players do
Mac witchu boo sipping purple juice
Your bitch wanna chill cuz she know the truth
Is my clique too trill living bird to woo
(so clique too my trill living bird to woo)
(Clique too trill living bird to woo)x2

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
That ain't reality its blocked the animality
That nigga possessed by the system on the exorcist anatomy
Radically rebellious to the fuckery and faggotry, not as a caution that you cannot sugar me
Not by the doctor with boy with the agassi that you got
I'm the antagonist to plot of how America with three K's wanna see niggas got cake
That the operation for the country seperation
Segregate and divide and conquer they wanna see us dead(eh)
Planet of the apes cuz now niggas wearing bape
Put a color in coordination that's why niggas hate on Dre
But he black too like a tattoo, report his color and
Trying to separate the kin from the mixture of the skin
Fuck a bitch B M Dub
Now he thinks that your the thug
Now it is against the world new millennium niggas like us
Drop the late shit down but you prolly gone hear me just like believe me in night and look for you and Ripley,(Why)
Wha wha

[Verse 4: JK the Reaper]
Fuck that though you don't gotta believe cuz nigga like us all have weed
I plenty shrooms when I walk in the room get any bitch here high with me
Tryna put the word through my penmanship
Cuz you don't get the shit cuz your inferior
Imma go slap on my interior boy
Toungue loud when we hearing you boy
Trap the photo full who has been noticed me
Nigga in jail and I'm sending them photos
I hoping they know that I'm out here grinding for a muthafuckin reason
Clock niggas on the IPod season what is your meaningful dream
Better wake your punk ass up
Like Sway in the morning I'm down and recording as early as hell
Quick cops wanna throw me in jail, What the fuck? I just be coolin
You ain't dropped off shit let me school Ya
Don't let this rap shit fool Ya
I don't want beef, I illuminate until we see the gates and this God says that we face
As I kill the Sphinx with a rival verse C9 is like Steve Jobs birth
Nigga that's the future God glasses I see right through Ya
Fuck nigga when I fuck which and don't
No body no body fuck with my kitchen
Cuz we cooking the difference
You niggas ain't doing shit different
Respect my vision little boy[Verse 1: SDotBraddy]
You can't tell me shit; Hold up
I dont really think they got it at first
Let me talk my shit spit truth on a verse
Let me talk to them niggas even though its gone hurt
Just watch as I bet, them niggas gone fall off over time like Ace bezel on T.V
So ya life a movie ? Come on fuck nigga boy you not a emcee, and you never keep it g
And ya girl say she want me to stick
So I left her ass barely walking like Flynn
While you in the crib waiting on her ass go figure
She ain't never coming back Ol Huell Ass nigga
I'm typically physically scaring you mentally
Pull out the stick and put you out your misery
Wrote this in braille so I know that you feeling me
Niggas are hoes and don't know they identity
In 6 months got on MTV
Now she blow a nigga up like TNT
No pie niggas in my circumference, so you can march boy cause you too weak
Cause I did this shit with no co-sign
Me and Marc met back in 09
Ganged up around last year
Did it independent, yea the whole time
So ya'll can't tell me shit
Nah nigga fuck that ya'll suck my dick
Middle finger to the Radio, Labels, and Media blogs who dont even want to post a nigga shit
Boy I'm a young nigga getting it
No fake or gimmick shit
We are not one in the same or equivalent
Niggas are mad that a young nigga killing shit
Boy they gone hate just as long as they hearing it

[Verse 2: Curtis Williams]
Niggas talking shit, who the fuck is you?
Couple shots, kush blunts that's what I've been through
I got a plan to be the man and bitch I'm on my way
85 blowing smoke out on the highway
Heading to M.I.A
Shoutout my nigga Bank$
Watch your mouth around the gang cause they don't fucking play
Making sure I get some money each and everyday
Anti violent but if you want it we gone let them spray

Fucked his bitch and she gave me more head
Slapped a ho knocked her to the flo'
Killed the slut now the fucking whores dead
Gassin I'm rappin the ho see me mackin

Ejaculate Salmon all over her face
Spray her like mace, first in the race
Pull out my cock and I pull out my Glock
Shooting these bitches in two different spots

Voodooo boyzzzzzzSDotBraddy: (verse 1)


Shout out to them niggas who ain't scared to let them triggers go
Fuck my cousin shooters who was snitching yea my niggas know
Fuck the witnesses and fuck the judge, just let my cousin go
They gave my nigga 25 to life like that's the minimal

Boy im from a city where niggas dont show no pitty
With a 9 in their hand they'll give u 9 like 50: dont get jack son
If a nigga try to rob me, you'll see what I have in store and yea boy I pack son

This life is kill or be killed
When you're still, they'll steal with a steel
So when attacking, be packing the shit that's clapping
Or niggas will have you dead
No witnesses know what happen

When the 12 pull up, they'll circle the block 2 times
Followed by 24 right behind, that's the first 48
P.I.G.S interrogate us talking bout its on tape

You wanna black ball me go ahead and suck em
I'm screaming fuck em I never loved em
And never did really trust em
And this is not a fib or a tragedy
But a lesson on how not to treat your family

Cause we had
Alcohol and marijuana 40 oz beverages
Adolescents feeling pain result to those as medicines
I'm cruising down the highway, get the fuck out of my way
Ice cubes in my drank
And my car is smokey celebrating Friday
Trouble stuck on my mental
I dont know what I'm bout to get into
My shooters are in the back
They will act if we have any issues
They're visiting down from Georgia
Fucking shit up in Florida
Peer pressure is on my heart
And my fear is in the aroma (nigga)


(Skit)



Denzel Curry: (verse 2)
Bruh, you acting like a bitch ass nigga
? one route to count figures
? in the end we all sinners
Keep an eye on your family cause blood ain't thicker
Imported the water from the blood of pure life
Headed down to miami with the mommies and fresh ice
Robbing and rolling and we got the Glock tied ?
Organized crime mobbing, gudda,  squading
Would cop an Iphone ? Steven was jobless
Enter the dark night its time to start robbing
Look at my cousins in the whip heads nodding
Gat, token pistols, hoking nigga on your damn street
Put 66 in your chest now that's Lebron rolling with that damn heat



SDotBraddy: (verse 3 )

Most of these niggas, have no father figures
Their fathers the trigger now you paint the picture
With strokes of ways how to survive in this economy
They never did school but they learned trigonometry

Shits gets real in the field
Trying to free my cousin Dee
So my mind is of Michael Scofield
But them niggas was ratting and actin just like a tweener
When all they really would of got was a smalll misdemeanor


Thats why its...
Killed or be killed is the mindset when you're coming from that jungle
All of my shooters have mindsets like Michael buffer they are ready to rumble
Choppas hanging out that window the motive was pretty simple
These bullets have minds of themselves and these here were meant for your temple


Nigga get back when, you hear that sound get back
Motherfuckers try to rob us ya ass will get splaked
Now you niggas microsoft
We'll aim it ya atoms apple
Try to test us and well go and get the mac


When i pulled off in my civic with wrecking odors of Henny
My nigga said he need work and my niggas know we got plenty
So we met up later the night
Shooters in sight
Everything seemed alright
Until I pulled out the work then he pulled out a gun
Motherfucker tried to take my life


Come on ....
You know my shooters ain't having that
Grabbed the guns then they cocked it back
Then they gave him till 3...2...1 then  they shot his back
Then I looked in my rear view can believe what Iv'e seen
My shooters hopped out the whip
Them niggas fled off the scene..... like god damn



SDotBraddy ( Verse 4 )

They say blood is thicker than water
I'm thirsty for family that won't change
And always keep it for 4 quarters

But wait..
The family scale is unproportionate
Ya son just got arrested and the crowd was recording it
So you can see Lemony Snicket all in my ear
Yea its unfortunate this event just had to happen here
But see my cousin was the shooter
Now I'm in the reptile room , with invertebrates and look alike medusas

(Skit)

I never did the ratting
Ratting will have niggas put cheese on ya head
Them shooters green bay packing
So dont D.I.E
Or it's R.I.P
With a head shot
Now they trying to see I.D[Verse 1: K-Trip]
It's a trip how niggas'll change quick
From real to low dick, from trill to straight bitch
So I be with my clique, cave be the side
No lie, 305, my nigga, where I reside
Where them hoes get down, niggas run down
Click, clack, pow, ? the sound, you better get down, nigga
Give me my crown, I'm the best in the booth
K be a trip, nothing less than the truth
Stay in my vibe, get high on herbal
Geeked like Urkel, but bad like Kirko
Bitches play, but fuck it, cause I'm from Dade
Where hoes get sprayed cause they just want to hurt you
My city fucked up, niggas dying everyday
Mentality where I stay, you ain't saved, no K
Up five boom pap, let 'em lay, all black
Blackland, batcave, bitch I'm 'bout money
And they want to play, my dog on the block
Didn't make it to your teens, then he probably got shot
Little jits getting got, the block too hot
On one knee, putting money in my socks
On two knees, praying up top
Hoping that the bullshit stop
But no time soon, so I carry the boomer to boom
I'm telling you fucks that I won't lose, K-Trip, nigga

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Suicidal bombers on that DMT
So I'm killing 'em, trying to become a legend like I'm William
Killing 'em softly, searching for a refuge
But this ain't Lauryn Hill, do lacerate and say I kill
Like the bastard that I are, contradiction, I got a father
Mischevious little boy, really, who's the oddest toddler
Like I'm low-key, really though, I'm oddly, I'm Godly
Niggas raid your clique like the Killer Klan Posse
Killer Klan Kasi, I see pussy, I'm CAT scan
Dark niggas in the night, bitches thinking I'm Batman
Name's Denzel and I'm far from a Christian
They'll reiterate the sentence, love God and no religion
Benzes will make you commit a 107
To me, I think it's senseless like a demon, priest, and a reverend
Raven Miyagi, that nigga, I be the master
What happened to that bunny on Tyler? So the dick was fatter?
No, that's Franklin, Donny's best friend
There's a "E" on the end of nine cause you 'bout to meet your end
66, 6-3, dropping like a 6-4
Killer, killer, killer, hitlist or that Death Note
Autographed by Justin Beiber, the future like HR Giger
Left hollow like Ichigo, Grim Reapers, and Soul Eaters
I don't give a fuck if you eat a pile of shit
If Denzel's lame, then you are a pile of sticks
Get it? Aquarius Killa Miyagi
Niggas that copy come with Kakashi ripping and kicking the lyrics karate
With a Bugatti, ride with a shotty, cause they might try to murk you
Trapping niggas in trapezoids, watch out for your circle
Like that[Intro]
Fang life!
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
Welcome to the land
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
What it's 'bout?!

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
It’s ‘bout a young nigga, running away from the moon to catch the sun quicker
Drug dealer, Nino with the steelo trying to sell kilos and grams
Settling angry stomachs up in his fam
So if that silver spoon on your plate, if you touch that, that's your fate
Don't have faith, Like Evans, you got to face demons to get to your heaven
The pimps is the prophets, not prophets for reverends, this is the lifestyle of a broke adolescent
So here's a lesson of a teen who survived Rikers
But shortly, his life had ended with a bullet that's made out of Midas
Touch

[Hook: J.K. The Rapper] x2
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside
You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside
You ain't have a fucking name on the darkside

[Verse 2: J.K. The Rapper]
Knew a young brother without a name, he was in love with his nina trapped
And steadily schemin, barely sleepin, but dreamin of pretty bitches and beamers
But when he awake, he sees his fate
And his reality, to do whatever it takes to elevate his fucking salary
Any niggas a casualty, kill 'em, rob 'em
Then casually walk off into the darkness, it all started
When he was, welcomed into our fucked up world, the son of a fucked up girl
And his father was just a blur, his life had took a curve
When he saw his brother dead on the curb, due to retaliation
Of the gang relation,  he was young, a kid, a baby
And yet to realize the pollution of the nation
Now he 18 life in jail is what he facin'
Shit, murder was the case that they gave him
Shit, murder was the case when they raised him
Mind stuck in the all black prison
You think he give a fuck about the system?

[Interlude]
(Car driving)
Nigga we gotta get this money
Damn right
We gotta get this money, I got the plans...
Everything's set up
Just got to go in there-..
Got the banger man, as long as you got the hammer man, we out
...Go by the book...
You ready to do this shit or what?
Yeah, yeah, 'this what I got to do

[Verse 3: Nell]
Out on the gank, rolling the dank
As he cased out the bank,  he was catching that shank
Getting loaded the stick,  trying to major his rank
Thugging was how he was brought in the paint
Rush the security, no longer pure was thee
Soul turned it cold for the love of the gold
Bust in the air, everyone hit the floor
Not giving a fuck, loc-ing off of the 'dro
Bodied a nigga, riding in a dropped ‘Lac
Top back, cruising them twenty fours
So I went crazy, my vision got hazy
I walked in the bank, and I start to get bold
Clutching that pistol grip
The teller was moving too slow so I pistol-whipped
The bitch, he was twitching, bust at a civilian
And blasted the mag with no mask in the buildin’

[Verse 4: Denzel Curry]
Burn the fingertips off, replace the dental
Left the golden bullet magic in his coufie, no his temple
That’s engraved, leaving corpses
In graves, Glock 17 cutting fades
Barber,  we dumped the security in the harbor
Then we switched the identity, so the name Leroy Carter
The bank teller looking short and squeamish
Steve pistol-whipped the bitch; she kept screaming
Shut up, ho, before a nigga nut up, ho
Steve said he couldn’t take the shit
So he took her to the back, then Steve grabbed the MAC
Then he put it to her head, and then he ripped the bitch
Boy, we gotta do a job or we might get toast
13 shots rung out and it left two ghost
Tales from the dark side, jack move, riding
Trials and tribulations of the dark and violent
