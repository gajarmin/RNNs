[Hook] (x4)
MA-LL-ON
Mary

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
From the tree house, you can now see the silhouette
Greasy, poor, needy boy speeding off in a limo stretch
Seedy talk, slow and low tow his comb through his widow's edge
Sleepy dog lying for science dying and pillow pet
Creepy still leaning on tire iron and lobby glass
Forty-four, door to door, order more of them body bags
Posse packed, corduroy, water toys and karate class
I'll be back, Play dough with Beowolf in a Chachi mask (Copy That)
Roger this, minor twist on a running theme
Minus Dean, dominate pocket change for the other team
Gutters cleaned, chimney swept, give 'em depth for a color scheme
Egg shell over bland white, van dyke over hunter green
What it means, forward ho, courts close to the watching eye
Tears like his are tenured and rendered for when his father died
Anchored to his angled and tangled for when his pocket's lined
Golden goose, holding two bowling shoes for his Columbine
Hop a ride, tag along, add a song to your mini-mix
Mega man, egg a van, razor clamped to his chinny chins
Sixty-six, route down, moving down to the Dixie chick
This monkey brought a weapon and heaven give him a pixie stick
Is he sick, if so, make him hurl all the stuff he drank
Hold his hand behind his back, get his hat and his money, thanks
Once he blanks, stand him up, hand him some of the onion rings
Tell him that he's good, get him Bush Tonic, Cutty Ranks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Side winders wind through fried wires
In a room of hired primates climbing on typewriters
Trying desperately to organize an alphabet in prose
That would render them in drastically exaggerated roles
I know I shouldn't care and I'm too old to play the dozens
But admittedly I visualize some ultimate comeuppance with
Heads on pikes and pikes on walls and hell bound knights who deny all involvement, it's awful
Off on a tough blue huffy
Got a bucktooth youth from an uncool cubby
Who step inside the club like a statue crying blood
Dance floor scattered, staff asking why I'd come
Man... shamefully whichever way you cut it
I was trying to impress some people I can't even stomach
You'd like to think you're cool enough to not care if you're cool
But the spirit gets distracted, the flesh is fucking cruel
They drag you to the tempest and extend you to the wolves
This would be the time if you had any cool signature moves
Escape artist careful not to spook the horses
From zero to a symphony of molecules in orbit
I never had a gold chain, never had a cold beer
Had a codename and a moral code he hold dear
Guts pecked out pigs snout gross beard
A B C fingers stuck in both ears

[Hook][Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
I spell 666 star six nine click
Give his telephone a Viking funeral, bye bitch
Treble hook two birds, cheap thrills, free meal
Vacate Jellystone Park with your brie wheel

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]
Now he sells le cars in Montie burns' Cazal Frames
Half his life was likely to be Nikes on the L-train
Gnawin' on his dog toy, pocket full of deer blood
The only thing that's stoppin' him was Dokken in his earbuds

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
Up around noon
Found everything he loved crushed down to a cube
The new Kowloon chowline, two leads routing medicine and gruel
One is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel
Identical water-separated pools
It was clever
But it wasn't ever neighborhood-degenerate approved
In swooped jukebox Fonzie, promptly
Bolts on his neck, one tubesock wonky

[Verse 4: Rob Sonic]
16-panel head mutton chop and Ambulax
Double pits to chesty got the ESPY on a camel's back
Handle that Huffy wit' a timely parry
And get all up in your kitchen, money, Guy Fieri

[Verse 5: Aesop Rock]
There is a wildly elusive moment of bliss
In the spaces between being told you are shit
I would openly suggest identifying the closest
And collectivly agreeing to meet if the sky opens

[Hook]
Ma'am? (x16)
I'd like to speak to a supervisor

[Verse 6: Rob Sonic]
Back alley brawl over party guests who want a
Steak tartare but we're hardly pet food
Charlie check booth, Brody's right
You're gonna need a bigger boat and a Holy Diver

[Verse 7: Aesop Rock]
Aggravated people driving lemons over limits
With a neck bop stemming and a cartoon physics
Smart move taught never broadcast holes in his armor
End up another poached foriegner

[Verse 8: Rob Sonic]
Handcuffed down to a toothless tease
Who got an X-marked mouth and a hooch machine
With eyes that tell the story of the woods that fetter
And a chest that sells the ending when it's pushed together
Been through the desert on a horse that's nameless
Now I'm driving through the city in the Porsche naked
Shores invaded by the new marines
That tear the roof off this mother like Buford T

[Verse 9: Aesop Rock]
Untrained pet with a pen name
Chest pain, bet he outlive his own endgame, anyway
Step around the rhythm of the red rain
Getaway car horn, stand by, tenth frame

[Verse 10: Rob Sonic]
Spare me the dramatics to ratchets, smile purdy (pretty)
Flashlight strapped to the calf of a wild turkey
Package of mild jerky, captain to aisle 30
There's a man with a mask an an app that can dial Fergie

[Hook]
Sir? x 16
I'd like to speak to a supervisor[Intro: Aesop Rock]
Limped up like a dog with three legs (shut-up) to the stage...
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the
Dark Heart News

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Breathin's a tug of war
Wet when I rush the ball
Flushed, 29 bust gum stuck
Clutch the door
Slumped in the back burn Bush by the son of George
Sweat tear and feed
Cause I don't bleed when I cut no more

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
A system of gods
From each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

[Verse 3: Rob Sonic]
Spiraled get vertigo
Signals the flash and beep
Postin my head for myself to get back to me
Pouch full of dynamite
Blast cap anatomy
Bags full of smelling salts
Mad as the magazine attack
Medic, Stretcher, Call
Cracked, Crazy, Header, Fall
A threat, a break, a mistake with a pulse
Pickin' every last fuckin piece of paint off the walls

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]
Okay the rotary corner
Grow to be notably mobile
And social gopher teeth form holes
Or any scene where Brie is normal
We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell

[Verse 5: Rob Sonic]
Burning it at both ends
Friends let's commiserate
Turn it into something to the sound that the triggers make
Born at the baddest sign
Half this time, still awake
Training all my zeros to perform like they're figure eights

[Hook]
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons

(Scratched) Extra, extra, read all about me

[Verse 6: Aesop Rock]
'ey, four corners of the globe All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast
Watch them collide and explode

[Verse 7: Rob Sonic]
When I peel the blinds back
Up jump the irons call
Monkey wrench in my hands
Razor cut the islands off
Homemade taps-memories
I ignore the private calls
And ever since the 80's
I think something's in my Tylenols

[Verse 8: Aesop Rock]
What plague?
Make an idolant brigade
So eager to walk planks
That we'll climb a tree and wait
Their irony is waning over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations come
We'll kindly disobey it
I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls in corrals with a key
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three
(THREE!)

[Verse 9: Rob Sonic]
If I had a dollar
For every time I couldn't sleep
I could buy a million locks
And finally read a book in peace
No more would my president come off as a crooked thief
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me

[Verse 10: Aesop Rock]
Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Panel of contemporaries killing me loudly
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks

[Hook]
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons

Three legged dogs that chew up the wrong food
Riff Raff (?) with (?) wolves
Land sharks know to take money, money, lose
Dark Heart News!
AHH!

(Scratched)
Extra, extra, read all about me
At the bottom of our news tonight[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
You want to know why? Because I'm
Dead messengers buried in their Melvin shirts
Awoken as reanimated mummies from the sepulcher
Anonymous and secular and ribbons and exposed brain
Roll with grown men who still use code names
Fold crawl space on the SS coat tails
Might chase six legs through his oatmeal
Oh dear, no pets eat his own homework
Pet cruise cobble step shoes that are bone bugs
Holmes, sick to the fishbone comb
My yellow brick shtick ain't tip toe prone
It's a misthrown sticky bomb slipping off the fingers wrong
Any blips you're witnessing are living in the Sigma laws
Blip, blip, dag, these ghosts need a doctor
Shelter, clean Dunlops on a walker
She sells sea shells he, draws revenge
Plots on a chalkboard, watch what you walk toward

[Hook]
Live free, die fat
Rock shock ‘till the kill screen time lapse
Watch how the blitzkrieg climax
Spring clean hijack, bring me my axe

[Sample]
Girl: What are you doing up there?
Guy: Stealing, I'm a weekend burglar
Girl: I'm on my lunch break, you want to help me kill half an hour?
Guy: No..

[Verse 2: Blueprint]
I'm laying in a cut over stuff from a bad meal
Staring at the sun, on my back like a fat seal
Debating with myself about whether not rap's real
Cause broke motherfuckers are the only ones that have skill
Everybody got intentions that they can't reveal
Major label acts got to act like they don't have deals
Claiming grassroots, I'm like "hell no
Your buzz is as organic as Monsanto."
I'm going at your beanstalk, ax in hand
Over a beat bought Aes Rock, that's my man
People sleeping still believing that we haven't expanded
But that's just a small part of the master plan, bitch
Printnificent, shining 'till your skin chafe
Write until the pen ache, reclining by a big lake
I'm only winning cause I went in an gettin' waked
Chillin' at the crib by the time you get your shit straight

[Hook]

[Sample]
You suppose robots would enjoy listening to music?
You'd think that if robots are electronic creations they
Enjoy listening to electronic music
You think you can create a scientific symphony
We'd not only send to our metal friends but
Would also be fascinating to human ears
You already have, and it's on the other side of the record
I can't wait to hear it

[Verse 3: Rob Sonic]
MIDI with a drum change queue
Cherries in the mirror of his Mustang too
Took his thang from the South to the rocking Hooters
Bought her wangs and a round, then he chopped and screwed her
Cops say they'd get him so he thumbed his nose up
Pedal to the metal, leave them dunked in donuts
Stuck on "so what?" from the aged Tequila
When he drove into the back of an eighteen-wheeler
Basic leader, camp is cardboard
The jet chooses raps to advance their shark soar
Park for (?) my cordial stingers
Address you crossly, corporal clinger
Attention all freaks with newer footing
My radio is not played by Cuba Gooding
Who's assuming that the man's a block boy
Cause he keep his fam happy with lots of Bok Choy

[Hook][Verse 1]
Parachute ratty, one bunk cord now the air is scooped badly
Dripping out the sticks like a twig-tweed hammock
Miter cut the cables for that quick, clean transit
Miser took the big screen; Panic made a business card
Ankle out of whack, painkiller tobacco scrap
We navigate the yellow corn hype for the barn
When the spotlight swiveled hard right over the farm
Post up, 3 cheers for the gimp
Spread thank you (3 on the right)
Limp to the door, splint what he mangles (3 on the left)
Yea I knew the percentages
But the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis
And over the scent of a thousand dead dogs
Agent ?Zip-Zooka? swore to pull it off, GAMEFACE
Walkie-talkies squawking up his hip regarding paratroopers: 20 (Ha!)
Tug ??a noise/annoys?? box-trigger reporting for hunting

[Hook]
I have landed safely
I have not recieved my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

[Verse 2]
Ride up on a killer horse, numb and bloodthirsty
'Till the uncle spitter beg the pig to hug mercy (Ha!)
240-below shit, kickers tickle the corpses (duck!)
Duck the widow-maker, also manufactures swords (ok...)
Manufactures ornaments, if it moves stick a fork in it
Winners take all, killers rape all coordinates
Unfortunately, courted by the most tenacious gaurdian
Whose aimless nature bait a harlequin taste the martyr's skin
No Semper Fi (Nope), no saluter units
Soldier the fire is more flesh than sulfer
And when the automatic-jitters wiggle the ribs
I feel so alive it don't matter which bitches litter is clipped (Bang!)
Sun down, goggle up; canteen gobble-juice
Teargas nozzle up, brain buff hostile youth
Chop it up, lock a noose upon it
You will die for the glory of...Shit, I can't put my finger on it
But it's big! Big and legitimate
Justify women and kiddie killer shit, iller it builds
So he is not a natural predator, but can dismantle an AK-47
Clean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren (Mayday!)
Muddy-gut snake eyes, he approaches cobras with an ugly muck
And bloody Bowie knife clamped in the canines
Wake 'em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon
WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION!?

[Hook]
I have landed safely
I have not recieved my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)
I was standing at attention with a pocket full of weapons
And the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that I slept in
I have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

[Verse 3]
I shimmy up out of the fox-hole, disorderly
Only after having logged every cadaver accordingly
High scores keep our Tama-tongs enthralled
(There is no course iller than no course at all)
Okay, if his perspective is smirked, sneaky detective work is aborted
And it's no longer whisper-mode on the red alert
No bed of dirt 'n' sniper rifle peeking out the bunker (uh!)
Now I'm set in city looking for something to puncture (*gunshot*)
Help me up, the numbers of the heroes sat at suppers
Treat the public like a tin can, riddled before it plummets (Brrrap!)
But, adrenaline can lead to lazy-eye hassles
So he list the little boy 'n took the pin out the pineapple (Heh)
Thats funny...Bumps into the steel-toe
Thats lovely, sum it up in (Oh, hell no!)
And just as fast as the parachute cable snipped
I was rag-doll, horizontal, two limbs short of fixed
Link a baby pulled around the standard issued weaponry
While fading as a blemish in civility's memory
They will step over the body for the looting..
(Ready on the firing line)
(The fuck is that?)
STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!

Tersed Ali keeping the first fair
Southbound breathing and grieving the burnt air
I've seen it all before and believe me you weren't there
Stop looking at me lady I'm a
(Space Cadet)

Turn down sheets the corners are so sharp
That you could cut the glass and the muscles of most dogs
A couple of go karts the buffalo go hard
The city got your money like a

Send out fees from buckets of bolts brief
And idea columns that followers won't read
And how to reform me the doctor is home free
And he can turn us all into
(Space Cadet)

Jet synch cars hook me on a treadmill
Jason catch with the last one fresh kill
And after the next hill get back to your left chill
Forget it man you lost them you're a
(Space Cadet)

She got drinks and mink with a small dog
Dudes is going hamming I'm bringing the Boss Hog
And she told me to saw off and beat it like Balrog
I hear your little mind but need you
(Space Cadet)

Sorry not right no way by a long beat
It's how my tooth broke when I ate at the Arby's
You're bugging a [poor flea] and stuck in an RV
Ignoring all the haters saying
(Space Cadet)

Dime store hood with a pension for big cash
Feel like I don't exist like second and fifth ave
I settle my drink tab
I heckle and Sinbad
Like Houseguest sucks!
(Space Cadet)

Crowded house dream of an upside
To work in twenty minutes with beef on the bus ride
See he's the alumni sleeping with one eye
Open since they broke into my
(Space)

Retail job when it was I would stay late
Clocking overtime was drunk on the payday
And open the chain gate would throw his [?] name
Like how'd he get up there in that
(Space)

4 Non Blondes with diets some lip gloss
They must be out of town I can tell by the hid drawer
And Delta the big broad is yelling I'm ripped off
Welcome to the jungle
(Space Cadet)

Random knocks on my door like I weren't home
The evil in the eye of the [bird] with the church clothes
And giving [the first thought or vent for the Jerome]
The rent's too high in my
(Space)

Patio neighborhood weather that we have
I'm fishing off the roof going to catch me a seabass
I figure that she has some news for your cheap ass
You gotta pay to play in a

Ending his day in a version of term loans
The shackles on my feet won't get me to turncoat
I'm telling a nurse though you checking the third toe
Now knock one back for a
(Space Cadet)Verse 1: Rob Sonic
Give me that, ahhhh
Give me that Turtle Neck shirt, a Tin Pan Apple, a German Shepherd
A wristband stance and a lurching Red Bird, and more Braves than the Turner network
Alive with a smile and a crazy cadence, that flips out if it's face is shaven
And Prince had all the names and places, on the tops of the forties by the Casey Kasem
No such luck in the silent scream, hope we die with the needle in the eye at least
Like Jimmy Hart and the Iron Sheik doing the roll bounce, James and the Giant Peach
Whole house like yeah he yells at us, gets fall down drunk but we help him up
Does this thing where he points at his pelvic thrust, and he constantly speaks of Beelzebub
Probably needs to adjust the voices in his head but instead he kind of just enjoys when
They get upset and start pencil pointing at whoever fucking left with the best of Poison
Boys being brought [what we] seven days, in the old world I'm told that the beds are made
Out of headstones, bones, and electric tape, now let the bodies hit the floor for the Feng Shui

Verse 2: Aesop Rock
Cleverbots bounce out of boiling sea, and foil hats hack toys into Soylent Green
Fat boy back wrapping his heart in bacon, part jarhead, part avatar of Satan
All bargain basement, some get lost, some get six claws to crisscross the course
In a town potmarked with potholes and pack dogs, half-wits rock with the not so Pavlov
Ah break a player into polygons, it ain't fair it's a jobby job
Another pet rock death to the shipwreck sweat box, coronary bastard, last word neck chop
Knock, it was nosy neighbors in the safe house built with the bones of leaders
There were basic tarp over stolen speakers, somewhere to weed out toking weasels
Raised by Lycos, maybe an age in the darkness, still make art out of garbage
Sleep in the arms of a hearty cartharsis, sergeant, a march on the progress
March on cobwebs, [though] had a poker face appear more like he broke a vase
I'm okay no qualms, wait some qualms, too many paper mache front lawns(Automatic collections, phased out, unsafe)

[Verse 1]
Bitches call me Ward the way I punish the Beaver
Brake your Firebird or else I'm coming to key you

Burnt side of chopper with his mug on the heater
Like do not apprehend if you're not one of his keepers

Shoveled your sheep herd, shepherd's your ferry
The jostle in and out of all available bearings

Bottle in his mouth he got a Coppola airy
Pulled overtook a leak., got Cannoli to carry

Pick in his axe hand, he passes the pair/pear
A little in the mutton and the rest in the day

Two fang, loose Frank Drebin you hater
A blue flame,[two jank], Jefferton's mayor
(Automatic)

Peppermint prayer, The Apple asleep
With a half-lit Camel at the back of his feet

Casually gashing your magnary teeth
Bringing dogs to the chapel, if the Gapple is green

Jackal and Gene, news at the diner
A back to the wall and a Tuna fish slider

He had to remind you with a couple of shiners
That he hanker for a hunk of what you ain't got inside you

(Like that)

[Hook]
The king on the card gave the crowd wine
The straws were all down 'til most of the hope died
The rabbit with the watch and the mole with a bow tie
They want us to reload with the soldier with no eyes

I went and asked Alice and she gave me peace
Some blotter, some poppers, and the famous tea
Some uppers, some downers and she basically
Said you oughta know that Thunderdome is basement weed

[Verse 2]
Paint the pariah, and pickle a patsy
Kraft get it in like the middle of mac cheese

Whittled a Raft fleet out of pixels and cap teak
When he could've would've should've just whistled for taxi

Gnarly gas HEAP, Happy? Enjoy
Sill times, leather time, Chatterley loin

Rabbit feet noise can get the cavalry point
To the posse out on Broadway, but it's after we joined

Watership Down, they double the count
Def Jam Jeeps leaving Rustlers round

Trouble in town there's no mistaking the sound
Of the shit hitting the fan from the janitor's lounge

[Hook]
The king on the card gave the crowd wine
The straws were all down 'til most of the hope died

Some uppers, some downers and she basically

[Verse 3]
It's like amateur hour, a pet in a poke
Lobby for the reverend and the veteran pope

Chest full of smokes and the Pebble Flintstone
That is prepped to pull your card and put your deck in the spoke

Iller than flow and stricter than Mel
Something he better pick up all Epiphany Felt

While Billy Bean breaking off the chickeny smell
Like he tried to sell crack to the Liberty Bell

[Hook]
The king on the card gave the crowd wine
The straws were all down 'til most of the hope died
The rabbit with the watch and the mole with a bow tie

You don't wanna be some old dude
Shaking a fist at the new bold youth
You were the new bold youth, now you some old dude
You don't wanna be some old dude
Wagging a finger at the new bold youth
You were the new bold youth, now you some old dude

[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
And I know you know I'm sucker proof
Mediate the over under, leaning over onion soup
And soda... Armchair's under ooze
Camera's on the entrances, TV's on The Bugaloos
Speaking of, what's up with you's? Y'all tried chilling?
No, whole time bow tie spinning, like "Hzzzzzz..."
Cough cough sputter, not to worry, there will always be another
I wanna say I nurtured all you little green settlings
But these lapses get the guillotine snapping, it's distracting
All-righty, play me what bumps
Yuck, I'm getting too old for this, shucks
Aes stay gold for this much
Gray and mostly tits up
Old man winter, eyes on the prize
Give the lowest of lives, the highest of fives
Cause..

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]
Wassup breezy, its the brush fire
Put Vicks on my chest like I'm Russ Meyer
I love Breyers
But I'm dumb tired
When they say "based"
I say "safe" like an umpire
They say waders are lame with the brush binder
Daryl Hall hair is bald as a bus tire
Janitorial and we're sore when his funk fibres
Start moving pip-squeaks like I'm Keith on a drum riser
Up in the club krumpin'
What up shorty?
"Yo, what are you, like 40?"
That's a whole other story with rips in the root page
And if age is just a number it's bugging it's room mates
Like dudes, keep it down you're driving me Bruce Wayne
And I'm three floors down and still hearing your 2chainz
Oh that's One Direction well regardless dude
It's not Nas getting live at the barbecue
So tomorrow dude just keep the drama calm
Because it's not funny when you call me Big Papa John

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
I am not here at the Raise A Roof or Parallax for feral cats
I'm in the same age group as Darryl Mac
Ask these slender teens if the denture cream is in stock
Engendered of remembered dreams in my inbox
Of [???] denim jeans or Gwendoline's like, "Pick rocks"
Now my bum knee and limbs pop like rimshots
And twenty-something's hard to compromise movie tropes
While my aftershave is some homogenized Uzi smoke
[???] optimize the booty stroke
While my sole possesion is a fossilized dookey rope
I mean I got etchings in my worry lines
But how the dream rings off the the precipice of thirty-nine
It's depressing, some pre-dating toe tags
Spell checking in a suicide note drafts
Y'all pull vintage tees out of them tote bags
I got a vintage me that is visibly cro-mag[Intro: Aesop Rock]
Limped up like a dog with three legs (shut-up) to the stage...
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Breathin's a tug of war
Wet when I rush the ball
Flushed, 29 bust gum stuck
Clutch the door
Slumped in the back burn Bush by the son of George
Sweat tear and feed
Cause I don't bleed when I cut no more

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
A system of gods
From each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

[Verse 3: Rob Sonic]
Spiraled get vertigo
Signals the flash and beep
Postin my head for myself to get back to me
Pouch full of dynamite
Blast cap anatomy
Bags full of smelling salts
Mad as the magazine attack
Medic, Stretcher, Call
Cracked, Crazy, Header, Fall
A threat, a break, a mistake with a pulse
Pickin' every last fuckin piece of paint off the walls

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]
Okay the rotary corner
Grow to be notably mobile
And social gopher teeth form holes
Or any scene where Brie is normal
We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell

[Verse 5: Rob Sonic]
Burning it at both ends
Friends let's commiserate
Turn it into something to the sound that the triggers make
Born at the baddest sign
Half this time, still awake
Training all my zeros to perform like they're figure eights

[Verse 6: Aesop Rock]
'ey, four corners of the globe All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast
Watch them collide and explode

[Verse 7: Rob Sonic]
When I peel the blinds back
Up jump the irons call
Monkey wrench in my hands
Razor cut the islands off
Homemade taps-memories
I ignore the private calls
And ever since the 80's
I think something's in my Tylenols

[Verse 8: Aesop Rock]
What plague?
Make an idolant brigade
So eager to walk planks
That we'll climb a tree and wait
Their irony is waning over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations come
We'll kindly disobey it
I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls in corrals with a key
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three
(THREE!)

[Verse 9: Rob Sonic]
If I had a dollar
For every time I couldn't sleep
I could buy a million locks
And finally read a book in peace
No more would my president come off as a crooked thief
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me

[Verse 10: Aesop Rock]
Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Panel of contemporaries killing me loudly
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks

I spell 666 star six nine click
Give his telephone a Viking funeral, bye bitch
Treble hook two birds, cheap thrills, free meal
Vacate Jellystone Park with your brie wheel

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]
Now he sells le cars in Montie burns' Cazal Frames
Half his life was likely to be Nikes on the L-train
Gnawin' on his dog toy, pocket full of deer blood
The only thing that's stoppin' him was Dokken in his earbuds

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
Up around noon
Found everything he loved crushed down to a cube
The new Kowloon chowline, two leads routing medicine and gruel
One is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel
Identical water-separated pools
It was clever
But it wasn't ever neighborhood-degenerate approved
In swooped jukebox Fonzie, promptly
Bolts on his neck, one tubesock wonky

[Verse 4: Rob Sonic]
16-panel head mutton chop and Ambulax
Double pits to chesty got the ESPY on a camel's back
Handle that Huffy wit' a timely parry
And get all up in your kitchen, money, Guy Fieri

[Verse 5: Aesop Rock]
There is a wildly elusive moment of bliss
In the spaces between being told you are shit
I would openly suggest identifying the closest
And collectivly agreeing to meet if the sky opens

Ma'am? (x16)
I'd like to speak to a supervisor

Back alley brawl over party guests who want a
Steak tartare but we're hardly pet food
Charlie check booth, Brody's right
You're gonna need a bigger boat and a Holy Diver

[Verse 7: Aesop Rock]
Aggravated people driving lemons over limits
With a neck bop stemming and a cartoon physics
Smart move taught never broadcast holes in his armor
End up another poached foriegner

[Verse 8: Rob Sonic]
Handcuffed down to a toothless tease
Who got an X-marked mouth and a hooch machine
With eyes that tell the story of the woods that fetter
And a chest that sells the ending when it's pushed together
Been through the desert on a horse that's nameless
Now I'm driving through the city in the Porsche naked
Shores invaded by the new marines
That tear the roof off this mother like Buford T

[Verse 9: Aesop Rock]
Untrained pet with a pen name
Chest pain, bet he outlive his own endgame, anyway
Step around the rhythm of the red rain
Getaway car horn, stand by, tenth frame

[Verse 10: Rob Sonic]
Spare me the dramatics to ratchets, smile purdy (pretty)
Flashlight strapped to the calf of a wild turkey
Package of mild jerky, captain to aisle 30
There's a man with a mask an an app that can dial Fergie

I'd like to speak to a supervisor[Intro: Rob Sonic]

Same stop, different seat
Wait, watch, and then repeat
Days, doctor, you believe
In the face of The Fathers that has made it holy

Hey, doctor is it me?
Or are they flocking to the sheep?
Great Scott, are we asleep?
Cause it seems like I got a mouth full of no teeth

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]

Jimmy placed his nickels in the token booth
And his everything bagel in his open soup
Checking out his numbers in the postal proof
He only missed by one, so he's 0-for-2

Heading to the late shift grave in bull
Whistling the break from Paid in Full
On the train, stepped, when he made his move
And grew a J-O-B in basic blue

Tried to keep the rust from touching faith
Coulda got somewhere, but he runs in place
Now, he's back on the wagon for a month, one day
And an hour, into lunch, until he's tucked away

Up at dawn, he had a smoke, fed his cat
His half of toast, made a face
And grabbed a roach. Took a pill
That made him laugh, so he could last 'til close

Used to burn buildings, now his pieces go
From the bottom of a bic to receipts in rolls
No cans, no crews, no more beef bestowed
Waitin' on a D for, at least, ten toes

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]

She sat across chewing Juicy Fruit
Earringed lobes that were loosely hooped
Shearling coat, with a toothy mood
The raven-black matched her Gucci suit

He hustled in with his patient plan
Doorway down, with a lazy stance
Ignore the cops and the shaking can
A quarter's not going to change your pants

He caught her eye, so she moved her ring
Smiled a bit, like "this bird can sing"
And took a cue, and he cut the length
"Do you like trains? Cause I love these things."

[Dialog Sample]

[:Man] "Excuse me, um, but I wonder if you'd tell me where you get your hair done?"
[:Woman] "What?"
[:Man] "Your hair is perfect, I'd like to know where you get it done."

[:Narrator] "A second ago, this groovy chick was just a girl in his dreams."

[Verse 3: Rob Sonic]

Anyway, they hit it off and trusted fate
And they transferred over to the Uptown 8
Headed to her place, that she said was brightened
By the trees on the corner, and a block from Dyckman

Knew the place well from his days with paint, but
Figured it was chill, and them crews had changed-up
Just like him, had jobs they hated
And were no longer on-point, and stayed mostly faded

Oh, she rated.  Tens, he scored her
And wouldn't really care if he caught one for her
All his thoughts were the dame he picked-up
Game was Atari, and the way she Dig-Dugged!

Doors were open, time to exit
A dude stepped to him with a diamond necklace
Read his checklist, knew maneuvers
And hit him with a two-piece tooth-remover

Thing was laughing, he lay there bleeding
And his ground control was not receiving
As she was leaving, he lost his mind
And gave her one big push for all mankind

[Dialog Sample] X 8

[:Man] "Push that girl in front of the train."(Happyland Disco)

Verse 1:
Cut it out
Let him work
A sleepy little order
From a sick chauffeur

Easy on the airbrush
And print toner
Let the blood drip out of
Where the windows were

Sent him flowers
And of course a vase
Take off the moulding
And pour the paste

In the shapes of a halo
And sword encased
They don't see the scar tissue
That adorns his face

Torch the place
When the job is fin
Steel toe Moccasins

Monster trucks and oxygen
In the house
If you asking where The Bronx has been

And it's a certain glow
A wooden leg earned in the service so
Brought to you by viewers with the nervous nose
That ran away to put the ring upon the circus folk

Be a jerk
And get beaten up
From years of the heathening
And easy love

Pumping gas
In an evening tux
I'm on a date in a trailer
With the pizza cook

Creepy stuff
Like The Walking Dead
Beam me up Scotty
Better call the vet

I let the dogs out
In the hall and went to get them
But there's nothing left
But paws and heads

Hear ye self committed
Ghost bunk jump
With your Elvis image

Planes, trains, cars
In a swell position
Cause you're a customer to me
And my name is Del Griffith

Button with a curtain hook
One time only
And first afoot

The bill on the block
Full of furnace soot
See if you teach a man to fish
He better learn to cook

(Happyland Disco)

Verse 2:
Like god is your name
On a W-2
A lime with a thorn
On the tongue of his shoe

A minor with a match
And a month in his room
And a hundred dollar bet
That he's hustling you

What to do
With an hour to dawn
Time card punch
With a couch and a yawn

Girl sick spit
When she mouthing your moth
Looking at my Gucci
Is bound to get pawned

On and on
To the epicenter
Of this year's
Number one weapon vendor

Park in the rose
With his engine tempered
With bars in his throat
Like a Pez dispenser

And all my colleague's grip
Coat hang slang
With the Poligrip

Billy milk cotton
While his Collie sits
Begging for a part
And got Dolly's tits

Now when the ship's in shape
Doughnuts gone
And the kicks displayed

Shadowbox
And the diction crave
I'm on a Land Yacht
Listening to “Wind Parade”

How much longer
Till the cops can news you
Climbed in the Starbucks
Talking stupid

One large pot
With your stock computer
Cause you hot for the teacher
But she hot for tutor

(Happyland Disco)(When you leave this building tonight, I promise you will never be the same)

Verse 1:
Poor little criminal, timid stockade
Rib visit, isn't full, digital age
Simple Simon diamond dog climb calling case
You do not pay your taxes put you back on your base

King's in the cape, many ate the pork rind
Like dead feather baked in the lake of pour wine
Fold what you're told, hold your golden horse hide
For when the levee breaks and your make-up war cries

I'll walk the line with my socks full of filth
The tilt-a-whirl, woozy, bluesy box full of films
That jog with my memoirs to the top of the hill
And knows what don't kill me, means the oxygen will

Flocks bring the pills watch the leaders drive by
With temporary tags and a bag full of bribes
Tribes with a tear are in earshots of wife
Learn to read the meter and [sub Cedars-Sinai/cyanide]

Peter piped pie so he rolled on the meece
And made them cutters into what they sold on the streets
Every hat, every glove, every scarf, every fleece
Now we've incorporated and get paid off disease cause

Hook:
Hey now, there's no one to save now
[That lame clown] that wait till you lay down
The same mouths [that claim you were great now]
Parade around [angry] with their blades out

Stop when the missile drop, isn't God straight?
(Get with their blades out)
Stop when the missile drop, isn't God strange?


Verse 2:
Nonstop if you rock, with it octane
Pole position hop six o'clock train
Willed em all, give a call, and if not pray
To leaky nose CEO Ichabod Crane

Mister spot stain like some Greaser that's gone
AWOL they face on degrees and beyond
Leave home, destroy, Ponyboy bleach it blonde
We will get at you dog by who Cesar Millan

Fold down the frame put your face on the bills
They bellied you up healthy but you paid through the gills
Argonaut, art is not Jason and Jill
It's little Jackie Paper makes your name off your will

And you can stay at home, get your postpartum med
And tell the boss you'll be in by the close part of next
Tuesday with a goose egg and an old army vet
Get the pistol bring the hymnals from the postcarded edge cause

Hey now, there's no one to save now

OutroVerse 1: Rob Sonic
Give me that, ahhhh
Give me that Turtle Neck shirt, a Tin Pan Apple, a German Shepherd
A wristband stance and a lurching Red Bird, and more Braves than the Turner network
Alive with a smile and a crazy cadence, that flips out if it's face is shaven
And Prince had all the names and places, on the tops of the forties by the Casey Kasem
No such luck in the silent scream, hope we die with the needle in the eye at least
Like Jimmy Hart and the Iron Sheik doing the roll bounce, James and the Giant Peach
Whole house like yeah he yells at us, gets fall down drunk but we help him up
Does this thing where he points at his pelvic thrust, and he constantly speaks of Beelzebub
Probably needs to adjust the voices in his head but instead he kind of just enjoys when
They get upset and start pencil pointing at whoever fucking left with the best of Poison
Boys being brought [what we] seven days, in the old world I'm told that the beds are made
Out of headstones, bones, and electric tape, now let the bodies hit the floor for the Feng Shui

Verse 2: Aesop Rock
Cleverbots bounce out of boiling sea, and foil hats hack toys into Soylent Green
Fat boy back wrapping his heart in bacon, part jarhead, part avatar of Satan
All bargain basement, some get lost, some get six claws to crisscross the course
In a town potmarked with potholes and pack dogs, half-wits rock with the not so Pavlov
Ah break a player into polygons, it ain't fair it's a jobby job
Another pet rock death to the shipwreck sweat box, coronary bastard, last word neck chop
Knock, it was nosy neighbors in the safe house built with the bones of leaders
There were basic tarp over stolen speakers, somewhere to weed out toking weasels
Raised by Lycos, maybe an age in the darkness, still make art out of garbage
Sleep in the arms of a hearty cartharsis, sergeant, a march on the progress
March on cobwebs, [though] had a poker face appear more like he broke a vase
I'm okay no qualms, wait some qualms, too many paper mache front lawns[Hook] (x4)
MA-LL-ON
Mary

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
From the tree house, you can now see the silhouette
Greasy, poor, needy boy speeding off in a limo stretch
Seedy talk, slow and low tow his comb through his widow's edge
Sleepy dog lying for science dying and pillow pet
Creepy still leaning on tire iron and lobby glass
Forty-four, door to door, order more of them body bags
Posse packed, corduroy, water toys and karate class
I'll be back, Play dough with Beowolf in a Chachi mask (Copy That)
Roger this, minor twist on a running theme
Minus Dean, dominate pocket change for the other team
Gutters cleaned, chimney swept, give 'em depth for a color scheme
Egg shell over bland white, van dyke over hunter green
What it means, forward ho, courts close to the watching eye
Tears like his are tenured and rendered for when his father died
Anchored to his angled and tangled for when his pocket's lined
Golden goose, holding two bowling shoes for his Columbine
Hop a ride, tag along, add a song to your mini-mix
Mega man, egg a van, razor clamped to his chinny chins
Sixty-six, route down, moving down to the Dixie chick
This monkey brought a weapon and heaven give him a pixie stick
Is he sick, if so, make him hurl all the stuff he drank
Hold his hand behind his back, get his hat and his money, thanks
Once he blanks, stand him up, hand him some of the onion rings
Tell him that he's good, get him Bush Tonic, Cutty Ranks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Side winders wind through fried wires
In a room of hired primates climbing on typewriters
Trying desperately to organize an alphabet in prose
That would render them in drastically exaggerated roles
I know I shouldn't care and I'm too old to play the dozens
But admittedly I visualize some ultimate comeuppance with
Heads on pikes and pikes on walls and hell bound knights who deny all involvement, it's awful
Off on a tough blue huffy
Got a bucktooth youth from an uncool cubby
Who step inside the club like a statue crying blood
Dance floor scattered, staff asking why I'd come
Man... shamefully whichever way you cut it
I was trying to impress some people I can't even stomach
You'd like to think you're cool enough to not care if you're cool
But the spirit gets distracted, the flesh is fucking cruel
They drag you to the tempest and extend you to the wolves
This would be the time if you had any cool signature moves
Escape artist careful not to spook the horses
From zero to a symphony of molecules in orbit
I never had a gold chain, never had a cold beer
Had a codename and a moral code he hold dear
Guts pecked out pigs snout gross beard
A B C fingers stuck in both ears

[Hook][Intro: Rob Sonic]
Hey hey ha
It goes one for the trouble
Hey hey ha
It goes two for the time
Hey hey ha
It goes three for the money
No seriously
Three for your money

[Verse: Rob Sonic]
Little tike too
He get his work on
In the outhouse paintin' tell Satan to keep his shirt on
Burdened by a thirst that comes worse if it's downstream
Tongue on his telly in mully Canal Jeans
Wade through the vomit and pockets of dinosaurs
Shout "let 'em eat the cake"
Shaking a rhino's horn
Been a minute where they spit with a long loogie
Pop gon' rap like he trapped in the wrong movie
A clumsy waiter who catered his own show
MTV crib in the ribbons of mobile homes
Floss the baby batter when power gets used wrong
Carbon people walk all over me into my tombstone
Madoffs and Adolfs
Stray dogs in plain clothes
Euros turn to dollars and dollars turn into pesos
Cold cocked
Shocked by the dude dirty
X's on his eyes with stars and the blue birdies
Still gold
This money got steel-toed
Pulling hell out of his hat and a train with his earlobe
He heel roll
Crooked, seedy with green thought
A bench warmer groomed for greedy marine corps
Seen your game, matched it
Incubated and hatched it
Nurtured it and fed it and when it trusted him he smacked it
Grew up to despise him and try him at all turns
But when it visits home it knows it should call first
Up against the wall
What it do, how's your credit
Arms up, legs apart
Marching calisthenics
Don't sweat it
Your purpose is pre-trained
Until your pinky-finger is swinging from keychains
Aiming for the mouth hope to get a bronze star
Hands up on his feet pick your teeth with lawn darts
Jumping jack rabbit his magic is deep shadow
Asshole this is foot
Body this is Tobacco(Super Duty Tough [Weight])
[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Keep it one hundred, like a fever or a beeper code
This for every hipster, lip your zipper and your "Beat It" coat
Jesus [Jones] right here, mice ears, pet rocks
Supercatafragalista secret words for red hot
Feds watch unmarked cars that look like mommy drove
Karate Kid it's obvious the posse in Miyagi-Do
Bobby don't start and get benched in the fourth
But go harder than your tartar in the Benjamin Moore
Slept on the floor, woke up thinking must escape
"What it is" is "What it is" and what it isn't doesn't pay
Another day, another door that mustn't fall and try to stack
And hit the corner market for the margarine and Dimetapp
The kind of cat to watch with the Comet and the orange Crush
Opposite the [catcher near] the ratchets with the Jordan 1's
Everything is terrible I'm daring you to mountain bike
Master of the puppets, and the freaks that won't come out at night
Leading you around the bend, heading you off at the pass
Squeezing stones until they bled, comparing Orange to Applejack
Rap attack, magic wand, levitating lemon trick
The devil needs to eat well in the details in your breakfast bitch
Put the fire in them riders in the cherry paint
No car, just a Tarzan with the bars
That wants to marry Jane Bailey
Say come to supper filing forks
So lay back motherfucker, don't ride the white horse

[Verse 2: Breeze Brewin]
Yo, usually when you hearing not for nothing
For real I bet it's about something just think of the double negative
Bringing up something relevant, elephant in the room or intelligence to consume
Is you getting this like my dude, there's some devilish type of doom
And it's coming, or is it nothing like but and I'll probably handle this
Forecasting or more foreshadowing, Ozymandias
Until you can't fake it, as it's getting bad breaking
Would you rather hear it or some cavalierish Hank Schrader shit
From critical degrees to reaching pinnacles
You see you need the irons and the niacins, minerals, Marie
And then fuck it the time's up and forget it your rhymes stunk
And yet you couldn't smell the coffee
Until it's could you get him off me?
As you were sinking, you were thinking, I'm good to go
Would you rather have him pull on your coat
Or your foot from your throat
Or a scary scenario like bro you [shouldn't] alone
Or brothers hit you with a tissue for some boogers to blow
Cause all [tyke are a dip of full life] the choice yours
And I ain't really talking, people squawking until their voice sore
Just a nonchalant confidant, on some cousin
You best to listen, respect the wisdom with not for nothingVerse 1:
Okay, bring whiskey, gunplay's risky
Ocelot hoof raise, roof made tinny
Drop, lift suitcase, newspage lip read
You'll say the worst and for her sakes hit me

Fake titty, scarred up nipple
Heavy on the [artwork] arson riddle
Smoke cleared, goat beard, hard luck symbol
With his finger on the trigger of a lost scud missile

Trust triple, funds in the Caymans
Dr. Demento, drugs for the famous
Suicide hot line rushing to save him from the cops
And to stop him from punching the patients

[SunSaver], rooms at the spa
Take what you need when you move modern rock
Savor the cream, cause your crew's Haagen-Dazs
While I ride with the princess and Ookla the Mok

Who got the Mott's? Porkchop greasy
Keys to the Jeep and a [school bought CB]
Money in the sock and the Corn Cob leafy
Like war isn't hell but it sure isn't easy

Hook:
Now let's get the chains and the busted pipes
Cause they got planes and trucks to drive
And they get paid for us to die
But not enough for them to fight
We got spirit, no we don't
But we got black eyes and a broken nose
And A Few Good Men but most of those
Are drunk in the back, singing “Row Your Boat”

Verse 2:
Bring gravy, some say crazy
Balconies, blankets, unsafe baby
Hallowed be thy name of a one plane Navy
I once sold shirts at an upstate Macy's

Unsavory, [Miniman me]
A six nation army vs. a Miller family
Old No. 7 in the pitcher brandy
Cause I never met a stripper that the liquor can't feed

Dance freak, I roll with your head up
More CHiPs than the highway patrol pancetta
Trix for kids not [for bovine leather]
So we only going in if we got coats and Berettas

Shock jockey, land speed drifter
Sipping on some syrup from the Ganges River
Kick it on the yellow bus, Andy's bitter
Cause I'm giving it to hell and krumping Aunt Bee's sister

Can't live her, forfeit the front
And head for the hills where we'll forest the funk
A bullet in his belly and a sword in his tongue
Like war isn't easy but it sure isn't fun

Oooh girl. We might need an extra rig for all that you're carrying there. Big Ben you got your ears on? I got the Playboy...I got the Playboy mudflaps. I got the Playboy mudflaps and the dice on the mirror. And the Jack Daniels wood paneling...and my bed. C'mon

[Verse One]
Anyone alive wanna stop by my cage?
Fill me full of pills and give me chills, pop and shades
Drive me to thinkin', drink the Gil shot and chase
Get down with acid tablets and distilled model paste
Anyone at all wanna answer the bell?
I got the Bible and the vacuums and lanyards as well
Razors and the two ways and some van timing belts
Magic kits and cabbage kids with cancer to sell
Anybody outside wanna stop by the store
Get me some sleep, refreshment and some Budweiser quarts
Don't forget the pantyhose and sun visors for
The money in the safe and the gun by the door
Anybody with time wanna ??
Passing by me salty and my staff's not a joke
Fire in the hole and my mask kinda smoked
You can see the sharks are kinda hungry through the glass bottom boat
Anyone who rolls wanna throw me the dice?
When the big money companies are closed weekend nights
We can rummage through the garbage and get both free advice
On how to fuck the world up and get groceries at price
Anybody who can try to get me some work
Cause I look for something better but my friends found it first
Tie dyed toking in the trend flowered shirt
Turn the children into army men with pretend howitzers
Anyone who knows you should show me the way
To the white light deacons and the freak motor cage
If I don't receive my halo when I reach golden gates
Then I'll fly with the Red Barons when I breach outer space
Anyone inside can you break me apart?
Take me to your leader and then make me a mark
A notch in the belt, melt a piece by the park
When I'm burning down the house, fuck it deep fry the funk

[Hook]
My eyelids are poised
My ears are on boys
C.B. squelching with lexicon noise
I started on to Rome and I'm just beyond Troy
So don't start no trouble or rock the convoy

Oh no no no
Oh no no no
OH no no no
Oh no no no

[Verse Two]
Zoomin' through the Apple when I roll with the top down
?? quiet driver, stop now
Thanks for the memories, kennel fees and lock downs
It's not that I don't like you I'm just not good with names
This is just insane but there's pit falling back
The arms that caught me once have all been ripped off and packed
Ghetto copped a plea to the tea pot black
And how many of us here work like dogs everyday
This is just the way we build machines for the war
And when the time has come they be like, "Please order more"
Sellin' death to the house, why should they scream door to door?
I'd rather leave here awkward than to not walk away
Anyone ?? as I'm sittin' on the dock like Guantanamo Bay
Simon start to mingle while cops fiddle play
While I'm chained to my bad for my hospital stay

[Hook](Chorus)
If there's hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Treats

Then you know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Free

(Verse 1)
I'm like, Dave the dope fiend's shooting his smack
And the tail spin's loosin' G's with goose in the back
Mayday weekend we can loosen the straps
And then ready, aim, eject us once the roof is detached

The rooster is trapped and the prices are swayed
The war effort fails when devices are made
There's blights in our lines and a heist in our safes
And the cats will go crazy when mice are away

[Aesop Rock]
Hey, thirty feet the fat lace, 10 for the rafters
Cut the other 20 in the 4 or 5 after
'Til each one on checkerboard J & J classics
Pose when he go to kick his apple box backwards

Daddy hack and brought a pack of bready thumb suckers
But the pigs grew immune to the tune of the fuzz busters
Blink, beat, cut a wink of sleep out of forty
You will gloriously rinse and repeat every morning

(Chorus)
If there's hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Treats

Then you know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Free

(Verse 2)
[Rob Sonic]
Wait, the people of dirt merger and theme stores
By design we're tough, there's no whining in those dreams force
If you can pick the winners and fix your mind for team sports
And if you can't then so it goes, it's only Joe's marine corps

Hoping those machines for, quarter thugs and free plays
Whippit rust, pitch adjust the mortar drugs and keepsakes
Keep your teeth and shed your skin, invest your mint in cheapskates
Roll around, Payola down on Benjamin your DJ

Get your pin and A-T-M and bend the tax law
Max your credit limit out and bet it all on hack saws
Build a cabin out of tree, front and center back logs
Rope 'em all together with the with the talking head and slackjaw

Rabbit's feet and cat's claw, knocking wood for luck like:
Teach your feet, pull double deck or stumble through the sun light
Get a closer look at what you were before the bug bites
Hand defense and get a smoke cuz you can't even fuck right

(Chorus)
If there's hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Treats

Then you know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Free

(Verse 3)
[Aesop Rock]
Lambs and lions, lions and lambs
You can't imagine the recital my tiny violins planned
I'll be the opus like a needle through the eyelids of man
And prop the bodies on the beaches of leviathan land

Fire and brimstone, fighter no, tiger by the toe
Kick and bicker while the evil images flicker and grow
Predatory ghouls that rule the roost swimmingly
Attach 'em to the business end of uneven chemistry

Black market shops, the cops that stole the serotonin
Shove down the throat of the moment he broke his focus
Now the whole damn city is rickety to the rivets
Still he fist up like the pillory in his prison

What a long day, what a dark night, what a cruel morn
What a demo if tomorrow's New York
And this is fresh out the dimensions of your record collection
Between the AC and Acadely sections, any questions?

[Rob Sonic]
Nobody breathes and we're all gonna leave here
But if they ain't gonna speak then we're all gonna sleep here
We're treats for the wolves like, hey there's no beef here
Now smoke if you got 'em and we'll rock when the streets clear
(x2)

I said we'll rock when the streets clear
You know we'll rock when the street clear
You know we'll rock when the street clear

These two can really be a problem (scratches)[Rob Sonic]
They want more feel to come out of it so
They stood there watching all the counterfeits show
Tell everybody that the pauper's here
And you can tell by the pellets they took out of his man
You're better off breaking your analysis' nose
Especially if your young and your talented don't
The checks generally got them balances though
There's them stars on the helmets like they're Dallas's, go

One way, innocence, two way radio
Gateway druggie with the run down ratio
War time crazy, go great with my look in fact
Ripped shit, bill a sale, stared when I took it back
You on some afternoon raps for the CD-
Crowd (show, you're?) syndicated, trapped on repeat
I'm on some late night, canned if I don't eat sleep
Honolu Vincent Price bad luck tiki
Bad in-flight plan, buckle-in
Truck rhyme, nozzle flow, high-code government
Auto-response, beats made of bufferin'
Wildstyle, peace of mind, wheat paste puzzlin'

[Verse 2: Creature]
Stand out, like a midget on stilts riding a unicycle
With a rifle as big as a stilt, ready to snipe you
Look, your own mens say they don't like you
They say you act like a bitch when she's on her menstrual cycle
Your parents should've advised you
It's apparent a blind man must've guided you
You ain't built to do the things that I do
Young Muddy Waters, Creats flow like he's out the Bayou
Inner City Blues, make you bleed, but I'm not Piru
Soul food for thought for seeds and sinners, too
Curt Mayfield, or Kurt Cobain
The boy heroin, need to squirt him in your veins

[Verse 3: Rob Sonic]
Quickly, get to the top of the roof
And head behind the car where the arsenal moved
And right beside the well, use the operative rounds
To let these motherfuckers know, there's no stopping you now
It goes- Downtown, up top, all about, audio
New York, New York, all about, audio
Downtown, up top, all about, audio
New York, New York, all about, audio

[Verse 3: Windnbreeze]
(Blitz sky?), polymorphic Hangar-eight-status
Swerve care-free, always did, no bounds out of it
Cloaked down, summoning my sumo-samurai
Larynx, catalyst, switch blade, carriage ride
Come on baby, don't cry, two-wheel spokesperson
Indo in your window, crack shadow where you flows circlin'
Boys burglin' soundscape, caught up in the scenery
Respond in a lounge- wait, caught up in a dream of me
Walkin' with a dramamine, spinnin' like I'm Seraphine
Afro-king dime, Lyme disease flow-er
One-touch, finger flooder, no quip
Got the Hangar bolt on the shoulderpad, star on the helmet tip

[Verse 3: Alaska]
Son, take a moment, catch your breath and own it
Home is for the heretics and Merrill-Lynch components
Nepotize, extra fries, five-alive, pesticides
Pride patriotic, gotta gobble up the exercise
Aerobic (class cats) phobias (abstract)
Fast-track race pace faith-based (scratch that)
Calomine or palomine, a Valentine to wash it
Downtown signs, why am I resigned to rock it?
Mechanical, arm-and-leg and beggin' for the armageddon
Army's gettin' ready for spaghetti western confrontations
Patience is a virtue that I work through as I case the joint
Anoint, take the apron, cut the strings, and I made my point[Verse 1]
Parachute ratty, one bunk cord now the air is scooped badly
Dripping out the sticks like a twig-tweed hammock
Miter cut the cables for that quick, clean transit
Miser took the big screen; Panic made a business card
Ankle out of whack, painkiller tobacco scrap
We navigate the yellow corn hype for the barn
When the spotlight swiveled hard right over the farm
Post up, 3 cheers for the gimp
Spread thank you (3 on the right)
Limp to the door, splint what he mangles (3 on the left)
Yea I knew the percentages
But the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis
And over the scent of a thousand dead dogs
Agent ?Zip-Zooka? swore to pull it off, GAMEFACE
Walkie-talkies squawking up his hip regarding paratroopers: 20 (Ha!)
Tug ??a noise/annoys?? box-trigger reporting for hunting

[Hook]
I have landed safely
I have not recieved my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

[Verse 2]
Ride up on a killer horse, numb and bloodthirsty
'Till the uncle spitter beg the pig to hug mercy (Ha!)
240-below shit, kickers tickle the corpses (duck!)
Duck the widow-maker, also manufactures swords (ok...)
Manufactures ornaments, if it moves stick a fork in it
Winners take all, killers rape all coordinates
Unfortunately, courted by the most tenacious gaurdian
Whose aimless nature bait a harlequin taste the martyr's skin
No Semper Fi (Nope), no saluter units
Soldier the fire is more flesh than sulfer
And when the automatic-jitters wiggle the ribs
I feel so alive it don't matter which bitches litter is clipped (Bang!)
Sun down, goggle up; canteen gobble-juice
Teargas nozzle up, brain buff hostile youth
Chop it up, lock a noose upon it
You will die for the glory of...Shit, I can't put my finger on it
But it's big! Big and legitimate
Justify women and kiddie killer shit, iller it builds
So he is not a natural predator, but can dismantle an AK-47
Clean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren (Mayday!)
Muddy-gut snake eyes, he approaches cobras with an ugly muck
And bloody Bowie knife clamped in the canines
Wake 'em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon
WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION!?

[Hook]
I have landed safely
I have not recieved my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)
I was standing at attention with a pocket full of weapons
And the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that I slept in
I have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

[Verse 3]
I shimmy up out of the fox-hole, disorderly
Only after having logged every cadaver accordingly
High scores keep our Tama-tongs enthralled
(There is no course iller than no course at all)
Okay, if his perspective is smirked, sneaky detective work is aborted
And it's no longer whisper-mode on the red alert
No bed of dirt 'n' sniper rifle peeking out the bunker (uh!)
Now I'm set in city looking for something to puncture (*gunshot*)
Help me up, the numbers of the heroes sat at suppers
Treat the public like a tin can, riddled before it plummets (Brrrap!)
But, adrenaline can lead to lazy-eye hassles
So he list the little boy 'n took the pin out the pineapple (Heh)
Thats funny...Bumps into the steel-toe
Thats lovely, sum it up in (Oh, hell no!)
And just as fast as the parachute cable snipped
I was rag-doll, horizontal, two limbs short of fixed
Link a baby pulled around the standard issued weaponry
While fading as a blemish in civility's memory
They will step over the body for the looting..
(Ready on the firing line)
(The fuck is that?)
STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!

It's falling into the same old mistakes
It's television and your channels are changed
Before your signals and handles away
And where you went when the vandals invade

(Verse 1)
And it goes like:
Watch the clock it's unplug the sockets
Fox in the hedge of ox edge and pockets
Froze violence of the flow gentle island
Curse like a sailor that's broke, pale, and squallin'
The ball cannon blast laughs last, believe me
Volcanic ash and it falls back to B.C
Your culture is crazy when y'all prays to TVs
From the malls and the stations to the break wall graffitis
We don't need no president smiling from the safe house
Stir the food what other days, what happened to the tapes now
Isn't life remember X the mental state of break down
Exposure to the looking glass a cookie from the waist down
Ruby on some super-dupe whining for the press stills
Sitting ducks at carnivals with tilted fitted fletch bills
Iffy from a jump jump he drum pumping pet pills
Automatic trouble trap and double platinum get kill

(Chorus)
It's falling into the same old mistakes
It's television and your channels are changed
Before your signals your handles away
And where you went when the vandals invade

Truth truth drop drop diamonds in the rough spot
Surf surf crime waves, lining up at bus stop
Work work eat eat feeling like you're hijacked
Back back hate hate the people want their minds back

(Verse 2)
Tip the weight of it but don't break the ice man
Current out a jettison and net him when the kites land
Who controls the pigeons pissing who's on your flight plans
Tonight we ready rumble packs and stumble back with fright fans
Had it all been up to us, we double up on scotch guard
Play the cards that we get dealt, tell chicks that we're rock stars
Flood the place with kerosene and lift the Zippo's top off
Tonight the smokey light of post we're riding in on Doc Marts
Coast, the kings of his bring back the 8-0
8 way sand of the panic attack NATO
Day to day mannequins [?]
Rain coat is lying [?]
Spurs dig deep into the eye horse saddle up
Twin peaks fire ball shit creek paddle stuff
Get some lose more just protect your raffle stubs
Notify the captain and he's laughing when he gaffled us
Jack beef fatal and nasal about the allergins
Outlaws renegades warriors and paladins
Balance on the wire tight balls with the power spins
Trying to find the piece of me that went down with the tower twins

(Chorus)
It's falling into the same old mistakes
It's television and your channels are changed
Before your signals and handles away
And where you went when the vandals invade

Truth truth drop drop diamonds in the rough spot
Surf surf crime waves, lining up at bus stop
Work work eat eat feeling like you're hijacked
Back back hate hate the people want their minds back
X2That's it baby
YES!
I'mma do some new shit, some new new shit off the new album
Never been done before

I'mma do it
Long Beach
Flip that, flip that

(Verse 1)
Involve etiquette medicine freeze
Mother is a pill still fresh from debris
Some fire chance fire Manson degrees
And yes I am still
Watchin' it
Look liver spots on a 30 year face
Dirty ear wax luggin' systems around
Illegitimate tax on my cigarette packs
Need another eighth coulda built some more jail
Pale in comparison the ford ______?
Prices like his we could read before sleep
Cheap sucker Schwinn with banana bike seat
Golden arch falling on my card charge fee
Hard wheat harvest for the rain that we need
Speedy recover like a pied in cocoon
Got it in tune slightly high middle C
But it'll be another month before I bark at the moon

(Chorus)
Sex backwards, piss for past tense
Hands for scandals
City now, ready how, steady some risk
Every out fits, it's allowed this

(Verse 2)
Don't interrupt interact
Or play with matches memories some of us never catch
Interference stays like a radar
But stays in the pace maker facin' off of microwaves
Nova casa blank add a thanks to your look
If I only had a tank I'd get more bang for my buck
Sam got a ____ (sand?) for the park thinking lot
And I can't believe that I'm still
Watchin' it
In a van in remote palacades staken' out
Nile west bio(vile?)-test til we're all taken out
When you're walkin' off it's only three miles wide
You're not a human you're a sardine that knows too much
Nine million motherfucks who all cook with gas
Will make the best damn rocket you've ever seen
Am-pheta-mine, left a
Space between me and your target group

(Chorus)
Sex backwards, piss for past tense
Hands for scandals
City now, ready how, steady some risk
Every out fits, it's allowed this

The eyes of my house can't close enough
Since I was told we'd be out of air soon
Yea, the eyes of my house can't close enough
Since I was told we'd be out of air soon

(Verse 3)
Justified leach please get off my skin
Found on the shore of anything but syringe
Threw a brick through the zenith before I turned in
So now I am no longer
Watchin' it
Everything is a dot since I took the bait
Hooked on new practices like dodging Mars
And crunching numbers that I'll never make
And collecting passengers for plastic cars
I'm still the same person, I just lost my faith
In a round about way I read much bluer
Newer my circumference in the mind it makes
Dates move, straight through, time stop, get fuel

(Chorus)
Sex backwards, piss for past tense
Hands for scandals
City now, ready how, steady some risk
Every out fits it's allowed this

The eyes of my house can't close enough
Since I was told we'd be out of air soon
Yea, the eyes of my house can't close enough
Since I was told we'd be out of air soon

We are
Watchin' it
They are
Watchin' it
All are
Watchin' it
We (or Be) still
Watchin' it
(You or We or Be) still
Watchin' it
They still
Watchin' it
We are
Watchin' it
They are
Watchin' it

SexIn one place
Goin' out to...
Ahhh yea, my man...

(Verse 1)
Quintessent, need a mortgage, main transplant
Went in his way high off the fumes
Scrapin' your hands while stand by try and consume
Media, ready mart, marketing, youth
Stuck in the track vital seismic primal
Urge to, nerves blue, under the mass
Fist, full of medicaid, zest, pull the decorate
Settlin' rocks through the window metal and stock
For the heroes crying for you
Slush, your a stone gas, first, in your clone class
Pull out my knife, carving I was not here
During an air raid so its under the desk

(Chorus)
I got five on the future
When it's safe, then its safe
When it's safe, then its safe now

(Verse 2)
Automated, hearing cones, satellites and drains
Name four things that you paid for
Without knowing it during the Bush campaign
Barges for ink, mink oil for slick
Waterford rings, for the last course, jock it(?)
It sings when he's half horse probably sick
Most of new ways, helium promo tapes
As good a time for a sample of my O plus
It's bustin' just inflate
When ya wait, for the shed skin
Ya wait, in the dead wind
Remember the code, before the money took hold
Then ya run and shook show, breaking bread with fate

(Chorus)
I got five on the future
When it's safe, then it's safe
When it's safe, then it's safe now

Cause that's my former future
When it's safe, then it's safe
When it's safe, then it's safe now

I got five on the future
When it's safe, then it's safe
When it's safe, then its safe now
