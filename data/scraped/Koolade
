[Intro]
Yeah, BK, Uptown, Boogie Down, Queens
It's beautiful

[Verse 1]
Listen, I got a lot to say
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today, I have to laugh on the real
The aftermath's kind of ill like I'm Dr. Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
This game make you get jaded, I just hate it (just hate it)
But this song gives a different kind of feeling
It's a new kind of dealing, it's a special kind of healing (uh huh)
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz? You know what it is
Positive over negative, see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster (that's right)
I rise up above
See, people still showing me love
Got the respect without dropping a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new hit, you can pop in the deck
It's beautiful

[Hook]
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is brand new Uptowns still in the box
This is the Yankees, 10-nothing, killing the Sox
This ain't hugging the block with a gat in your hand
This is Boca Raton on a catamaran (that's right)
With the sun beaming down where you at in the sand
I feel like I'm more than a cat with a plan
This feels like it's more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in your hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
That's why I stole this mic, y'all don't hold this right (nope)
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack, no a glass of Henny (that's right)
Now drink it up 'til there ain't nothing left in it
I'm repping it, BK, that's a definite
Just more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(I'm wishing on a, on a, on...) the most beautifullest thing ever
And it's here to bring terror to the bling era (yeah)
You can feel it in your inner
It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving dinner
It's like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark (swish)
It's that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat gon' use it
I see a black man aiming his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claiming his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down with Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it cause it brought us here
It's a young mother braiding her daughter's hair
It's beautiful

[Hook][Verse 1:Target]
Ja, poslušaj pažljivo kaj pričam
Jer svaki put rokam sažeto
Ravno iz grada di je Dinamo ime sveto
Još jedno pakleno ljeto, da li si ikad prošet'o
Širim centrom kaj više liči na geto?
Pa skočil do kvarta na kavu
Posjetil predgrađe, gdje je klincima najslađe
Napraviti sitne krađe, obrstiti trešnju
Kiosk zbog pljuga il ledo škrinju
Da ublaže vrućinu, djeca su pa ne brinu
Adrenalin se diže k'o temperatura zraka
Otkucaj srca junaka, pozdravi škvadra svaka
Ili tišina il' plaka plaka dok kruže danju
Ili pod zaštitom mraka, ko majstori nunčaka
Zagrebačka fjaka ko posljedica čistaka
Ljeto je u kvartu svih izgubljenih dječaka
Nada nestala bez traga, kao I draga
Pa nema interesa za prijelaz kvartovskog praga
Ima nas kaj čitamo novine u carstvu hladovine
U praznom bircu kao I prošle godine
Osjećam k'o da ni'ko ne voli me, al' boli me
Ak' hoćeš moje društvo nazovi me I zamoli me

[Hook: Target, General Woo]x2

Na užarenom betonu odrasli, škvadru našli
Gledali razne promjene vlasti, nekak' se snašli
Sami sebe pronašli I ustali iz blata,...
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta...

[Verse 2: General Woo]

Odvoji sranje od istine, 'ko su klošari?
Mladi bez budućnosti, na drogama k'o žohari
Nemoćni, al' opasni jer dolaze iz kvarta
Sjebali bi brata zbog vrućine asfalta
Odgovori mi onda,tko su đaneri I pijanci
Mafijaši I gangsteri što ih zovete kriminalci
Zarađujemo na crno, neki manje, neki više
Al' kad jednom te sklempaju, uvijek isto ti se piše
Danas puno ih dila, većina hrpa je debila
Sjebu se u startu jer nisu imali stila
Neki rade zbog zarade, robu troše na sebe
Papci su se zakačili, pa onda 'ko ih jebe
Klinci 'oće bit' tajkuni, curice bogatašice
Neki kriminalom, a neki pomoću pičkice
I srce mi se kida, ovdje živimo bez stida
Dobre stvari su nestale kao nekad Atlantida

[Target]

Bože, daj mi hlada
Jer vražja temperatura ne pada
Sam se borim sa Suncem
Jer su drugi pobegli iz grada
Ljutit pred njim I sav se znojim
Da li zato kaj me kuje
Il zato kaj se bojim
Htjel bi krvi da mu se napojim
Da mu pokažem zakaj postojim
Isto sa njim il' tipom bilo kojim
Ponovo izbroje kaj frajer calta
Dobro došli u drugi dio vrućine gradskog asfalta!
Za sve kaj su ustali iz blata
Jer ne trpe sranja već žele dio zasluženog poštovanja
Poznate znate, a druge ne mogu da uhvate
Frankfurtska veza brate, za sve Hrvate
Nisi kužio spiku, pa si sad na na trajnom počinku
Još jedna mrlja krvi na pločniku
Kaj će izbljedit na Suncu kaj fura nesnosnu vrućinu
Nevine žrtve poćivale u miru!

[Hook]x2

[Verse 3: General Woo]

Ak' je vani 35, na asfaltu je duplo
Od vrućine me boli jer je u glavi nešto puklo
Papci su pali, nova promjena vlasti
Tajkune u zatvor, da bi novi mogli krasti
Mama mi je rekla budi dobar I fin
S ovim privlačim pozornost kao papke heroin
Zato pogledaj mi rane, dal' prepoznaješ krv?
Rulja ždere ovaj asfalt kao pokojnika crv
Zato k'o je s nama, s nama je
'Ko nije, k nama je
I drolja, buraz, dama je, dok kuja ne zalaje
Jer tanka je linija između cuge I pljuge:
Jedni mlate velku lovu, a svi ostali su sluge
Mnogi motaju duge jer dugački su dani
Uroka ne znam što bi značila riječ "stani"
Situacija je jebena, uroka ni od pelena
Vrućina gradskog asfalta, stimulacija zelena

[Outro: Target, General Woo]

Aha, na vrućini gradskog asfalta, škvadra iz svakog kvarta
Jer od pelena do groba, u bilo koje doba
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Od šaranja po betonu I slušanja o bontonu
Do šatre o babilonu I treba na fukodromu
Sa starcima il' frendom, rokamo svojim redom
U fajtu sa bedom
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Jer rolamo pljugu
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Di ispijamo cugu
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Uz sreću I tugu
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Za ljude iz kvarta za sve iz kvarta[Chorus 2x: Masta Killa]
What you see, ah, you ain't seen nothing yet
Ah, you ain't seen nothing yet, ah, you ain't seen nothing yet
I thought told you

[Verse 1]
What you see is what you get
And you don't see and don't respect
You must be blind and can't detect
That I am from that BK set
Where Bible men flex big chains round necks
Wet late night sex, big dice game vets
Sweat, no threat, north, south, east, west, Weed gun men bet
Then all run it down, it's all good, I thought I told you
Any mother step in the square, I bet I fold you
Rhyming on timing, I shine like I'm suppose to
Nothing come close to son, it don't suppose to son
I thought I told you

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
Get funky like Lucy on the bass guitar
Make the ladies wanna drop they pants, lose they bra
I guess it just comes with the life of a star
Fly jets out of air force base, down in Shaw
I know you never heard it like this before
Real slick when he talk, the East New York walk
We can Iron Mic spar, ten paces then draw
Raw 'caine, straight from the grain, the royal Lion King
Keep it raw, hit the floor, heavyweight word
Break a man jaw on the floor, that's what you pay for
Sold eyes towards the broad, and like the mic strike
Thunder like the hammer of Thor, and keep it rough, sun[Strick]
Yeah, big Strick, let's get it on...
Yo, last night I had a nightmare that I was wack
Nope, I'm sorry, it's that you said something dope
Fuck it, it don't matter, cause I know shit ain't really like that
Cause if you said something dope, I know somebody else probably had to write that
You on the wrong song an' I'm on the right track
I hit the cypher, and you bounce talkin' 'bout "Strick, I'll be right back!"
What the fuck you comin' back for?
I pulled up to the front of the club and hurried and scurried up out the back door
Just in time 'fore your ass got a cracked jaw
Made cause I stack more, and what the Lakers sign Shaq for?
Incredible rhymer, what the hell am I sell crack for?
I'm real, you a ac-tor, I'm hot, you just not a fac-tor
You on some 'bout to do, I'm on some already done shit
I'll burn you with the same light you just lit up your blunt wit'
And I done came wit' the style you probably 'bout to come wit'
You the opposite of smart faeces, get it? Dumb shit
Could give a fuck who you run wit'
Or them niggas you 'bout to go get
Matter of fact, go get 'em, you'll just be layin' on the floor wit' 'em
Lookin' up at me talkin' 'bout: "Why you let the fo-fo hit 'em?
I really don't know these niggas, I just did a show wit' 'em
Went back to the telly and I hit a couple of hoes wit' em
Met 'em at the studio an' just spit a couple of flows wit' 'em
Bought a bag of dro and just sat back and got high wit' 'em"
Oh yeah, that's good to know, now you 'bout to die wit' 'em
Head straight to the pearly gate, say hi to the big guy wit' 'em
Or take it to that other level, down with the devil and fry wit' 'em
Grumble and groan, piss and moan, boo-hoo and cry wit' 'em
Atleast go home and tell his momma bye bye wit' 'em (bye, momma)
Cause duke, I'm the hottest nigga on earth right now
And bust my gun in nine months 'bout to give birth right now
Run all up in a nigga hood and take his turf right now
Nothing's what your life is worth right now
I've been in shit for too long, it's about time I burst
A & R's ready to quit cause they ain't find me first
Record labels ready to shut down cause they ain't sign me first
So let me stop right now cause I know y'all niggas be dieing to be writing
My verse

[Hook: Young Zee]
If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve at night to the cracks o' dawn
Got girls in the back takin' off they thongs
Then feelin' that something's wrong!

If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve a.m. to the early morn'
If you seen them things then blow ya horn
Cause if ya not there's something wrong!

[Masta Ace]
I came outta rap training camp as a reigning champ
An' lay motherfuckers down just like the pain of a cramp
I won't stop 'til I see my name and my face on a stamp
And y'all still won't be able to stick me or fuck wit' me
I'm 'bout to leave my mark on this game like a buck fifty
Took shots but I duck swiftly, you just missed me
Fuck Alice, ????, Norton and fuck Trixie
I'mma fuck like it's my honeymoon 'til I touch sixty
You ain't a thug so don't try to get tough with me
If you think about tryna hit me, you'll get snuffed quickly
Deep down, hate Bobby Brown, but love Whitney
At times I wish it was O.J and the glove fit me
Then I wouldn't have to hear none of you wack niggas
Talk about how your crew's rich and you stack figures
In my hand's a chrome gun with a black trigger
I know you think your shit's big, but I pack bigger
Just ask your wife, cause I blasted her pipes
If I tell Strick to pass me a knife would you ask for your life?
You's a pussy, I can tell by your song
Homo/thug rapper, I can tell by your thong
Got sugar in your tank, you probably shit syrup
The world's about to see what it is when I hit Europe
And when I come back on for my birthday
I'mma do another video, too explicit to play

[Hook]

[Young Zee]
Ace, Zee, yo Strick, Bricks, Zee, Outsidaz, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Niggas fear me like the fear of Aids
I take out pretty boys wearin' shades
Or thug niggas with they hair in braides
Then fuck yo' girl through that thing she wearing
Get her pregnant to leave that bitch a single parent
Got mad cars, you probably ain't been in a Jaguar
Drunk at Justin's, while you hang out at a fag bar
Scared at jail, but at home you tryna rob
When you got inside you got sodomized by a lotta guys
Girls pile up in Young Zee room
I fucked the wives of about twenty grooms on they honeymoons
We had a check sellin' bottles of rock
An' so much dope came we re-modelled the spot
That's why y'all cats spittin' ??????????
See you grinnin' when I stop and the rims keep spinnin'
Fuck with Zee I'll bash ya face
I'll fucks wit' {*scratches*} Masta Ace, bitch[Verse 1: Sunny Bizness & Bosca]
Der Asphalt ist kalt, ich seh Hass und Gewalt
"Let me tell you 'bout my life" War nur Spaß
Eigentlich ist' ganz OK, ich red' jetzt mal klartext
Ich beam mich von Frankfurt nach Zagreb (Deutschrap)
Den Kopf voll mit Bars, das Gepäck voller Gras packs
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"
Ja, ich reis' meinem Traum hinterher und greif' nach den Stern'
"Let me tell you 'bout my life" Wir waren alles am verlieren
Doch holen das, was wir verdient haben, wieder
Und [?] nach Texten voller Hass dann einen von Frieden [?]
Und haben die Scheiben gescratched
Wählen unser eigenes Recht
Doch du kannst [?] auf den Jungen ohne [?]
Nix zutun mit allen Meetings und Catering
Doch kenn' Dinge, außer Arbeit, die für Miete das Geld bring'
Mit den Besten aus mei'm Kreis, komm und teste mich am Mic
Also "Let me tell you 'bout my life"

[Hook: Sunny Bizness, Bosca, Born & Bagdad]
Und wir wussten, dieser Weg wird nicht einfach sein
Denn wir haben alles gesehen und wir haben alles erreicht
Und wir liefen gegen Berge, Fels und Stein
Wir wollten alles verstehen, als wär' das alles so leicht
Wir schreiben Zeilen für die Ewigkeit
Wir hatten so viel vor, nur zu wenig Zeit
Doch wir kämpfen immer weiter, weil sonst eh nichts bleibt
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"

[Verse 2: Born & Bagdad]
Als ich nichts hatte, war die ganze Scheiße nicht leicht
Ich mein', "Let me tell you 'bout my life", wenn die Zeit reicht
Schicksal, nenn es, wie du willst, ist egal
Auch wenn ich nichts hab, füllt diese Stimme einen Saal
Vom Feinstaub zum Ausblick, von Rauschgift weg, aha
"Let me tell you 'bout my life" Und was ist jetzt?
Jetzt ist es so, dass die Kohle gerad' reicht, und eins:
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"
Es geht um Ruhm und Musik, Flus und Haschisch
Auf der Suche nach Frieden zwischen Booth und der Street
Einem Leben zwischen Leid, Mut und viel Krieg
Gib der Wut ein Ventil, sag, "Let me tell you 'bout my life"
In meinem Land fließt noch Blut wie Benzin
Und Menschen sterben täglich nach dem Zufallsprinzip
Was für "Zukunftsmusik"? Hier sind Kugeln im Spiel
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"

[Hook: Sunny Bizness, Bosca, Born & Bagdad] (x2)

[Sample + Scratches]
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"

[Verse 3: Sunny Bizness]
Siehst du, wie ich von ganz unten nach den Sternen greif'
"Let me tell you 'bout my life" Nichts ist, wie es scheint
Nur weil ich gerne positive Mukke mach'
Heißt es nicht, mein Leben wäre leicht
Nein, ganz im Gegenteil, ich zahlte für meine Fehler den Preis
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"
Ich mach'n Cut mit der Vergangenheit
Ich mach'n Cu-Cu-Cut (Scratches) Cut mit der Vergangenheit
(Scratches) Ich mach'n Cut mit der Vergangenheit
Und tausche Tränen gegen Schweiß
Ich mach'n Cu- (Scratches) Cut mit der Ver- (Scratches)
Ich mach'n Cut mit der Vergangenheit
Und tausche Tränen gegen Schweiß
Ich mach'n Cu- (Scratches) Cut mit der Vergangenheit[Intro: Consequence]
Let me hear you say (HEY) get money (HEY)
Get money (HEY) get money (HEY)
Get money (HEY) get money (HEY)
Now let's go

[Hook: Consequence]
Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first
So if you ain't bustin down, please disperse (uh)
Please disperse (uh) please disperse
I know I never should've bought that tease the purse, uhh

[Consequence]
But homie that's what happens when your {dick} in the dirt
And I guess that's what happens when your whip's in reverse
And you on the Eastside between 2nd and 1st
And you pull up on the stunt, and she dressed as a nurse
And you tell her all the things you mighta hit in a verse
And surprisin to you, man the script really works
So she gives you all her numbers plus her name and the chirp
And you made sure it's right when you hit the alert
Then you call her up tomorrow and you scoop her from work
Then you bring her round the way and the crew go berserk
Now the only question left is really who's goin first
And if you can't find a condom then you go and search
And by the time you get back shorty's way more than burnt
And she done buttoned up her blouse, and pulled up her skirt
And now you ask her what's wrong, and what went wrong?
"If you can't get her calm then you really ain't a don"
Now she yellin out "Cons, you played yourself
I wish the playa that I met woulda stayed himself"
What made me say to myself, I need to drop this chick off
'Fore the police at the door and they blockin me off
Cause you know she's testifyin like a Christian in church
So I ain't have no other choice but tell the chick disperse

[Hook] - 2X

[Gangsta L. Crisis]
Drinkin Coronas in Pamona with Mona
From the Chi so I'm cold as pneumonia
A player they warned ya, about girl I'll put it on ya
Let me mack you down in this corner
Look like the type that look good in the mornin
E'ry time we bonin you moanin
Love they way I {fuck} you have you tellin your homies
Tryin to have {shit} on lock like the police
Get mad when the other {ho} know me
Especially cause they lovin my goatee, 'fore we was +Drivin Slowly+
Went to the West, tryin to ball like Kobe
And the cold broads, was all our trophies
Kept a main girl in the show piece
Lookin at that {bitch} low-key in the Oakleys
Love the way them hips is perfect - if you ain't tryin to show me
Baby you can start dispersin, that {shit} ain't workin

[Hook] - 2X

[Really Doe]
The venue's sold out, know I'm 'bout to snap
Three rows from the front, two seats to the right
Hit her with a pass, courtesy of the man
Kick it with the stars, bring a couple of friends
Let you meet 'Ye, yeah that's the fam
Track 14, that's your favorite jam?
Damn, I'm in town for the night
Take a sip of the potion and let's get right
Into some roleplay, be wifey
No paper, no time to autograph your tee
Spotted you on stage dancin all freaky
Now you're in the back, actin shy tweakin
This ain't "Meet the Parents," what the hell you thinkin?
This ain't the church and I ain't the deacon
Damn, I'm tryin to get you out them boots
And say the first thing on my mind like Luke
Sit back, and chill with the crew
Instead you got your mind on my money and my loot
Talkin 'bout "I came back to kick it
Let's exchange digits, fly me in, I'll visit"
Cool out, you gotta be kiddin
But leave your wristbands on the table, now beat it
Worse comes to worse my peoples come first (HEY)
If you ain't bustin down (HEY) disperse (HEY)
Disperse (HEY) disperse (HEY)
Disperse (HEY) disperse (hey)

[Hook]

[Consequence]
Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first (uh)
So if you ain't bustin down, please disperse (uh)
Please disperse (uh) please disperse (uh)
Please disperse, please disperse

[Tony Williams harmonizes to the end][Intro: Ghostface Killah (Mr. Maygreen)]
Aiyo, what up party people (Yeah, my name's on the guest list)
This is the Wallabee kingpin in the building (As Mr. Maygreen... good evening...)
Right about now, I'm about to show you how good we are (I'm in the club, I'm)

[Hook: Mr. Maygreen]
(Good), I look so, (good), the car look
(Good), I'm in the hood, and I'm okkkkkk
(Good), the jewels look, (good), the girls look
(Good), they all from around the wayyyyy
(Good), hey there, (good), look at you
(Good), me, I'm just passing byyyyyyy
(Good), look at her, (good), time out
(Good), I think I'll give the game a tryyyyy

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, my rose was good, plus my face was good
The way I wear my jeans up over my boots is hood
And my cash is good, the grass, spread it out, over the hash is good
The grasp who be hypecast is good
That's the bird that fucked the game up
Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cuz I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood
And we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up
And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose
Cuz they shit is too fat like an adidas sole
Don't even touch my gold, I'm good

[Hook: Mr. Maygreen]
I know you heard it a thousand times
Not quite like my design
You say that's what you looking for
Gator boots walk through the door, now

[Bridge: Ghostface Killah (Mr. Maygreen)]
(Good) Theodore's good, (good), my team is good
(Good) My robes is good, (I'm so good)
(Good) My moms is good, (good), my style is good
(Good) My queen is good, yeah, come on, (I'm so good)
(Good) The days is good, (good), babies is good
(Good) Wifes is good... uh-huh
(Good) The hood is good, (good), God is good
(Good) Everything is good, come on, let's go

[Ghostface Killah]
Goose over ice cubes, pass the O.J
Two light skinned wizzes, want Ghost, on both ways
Come here, sit on my lap, it's not a gat, sugar
Have a seat, don't be afraid to move back
Feel that? You'se a nasty girl
Big butt, slim gut, I'll crash your world
It's not polite to bend over in Starkey face
Sheer lace, fat ass, got want me to taste that
Lodi dodi, with a coke shaped body
And my jewels hang low like my balls in the potty
And I dare ya'll to try to rob me
Theodore U, we got the army
A-Town to Mariner's Harby
Wild West, Now Born, go hard, G
Killa Hill, Stapletown, Port Rich' kids
Pack heat, like I was pulling out biscuits

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Trife Da God]
When we on the block bubbling rocks, watching for cops
Holding Glocks in and out of the spots, (it's all good)
When we overseas, getting that cheese, whipping the hottest V's
Blowin' exotic trees, playa, (it's all good)
When I'm in the whip, sunk in the six, drunk off the liqs
Pull up, stunting, fronting for chicks, (it's all good)
When we on stage getting them Grammy's, snatching them panties
Jetskiing off the shores of Miami, (it's all good)

[Hook]

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah... told ya'll before, another Theodore Production
This is how we go in the 06 to 07, come on, come on

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, BK, Uptown, Boogie Down, Queens
It's beautiful

[Verse 1]
Listen, I got a lot to say
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today, I have to laugh on the real
The aftermath's kind of ill like I'm Dr. Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
This game make you get jaded, I just hate it (just hate it)
But this song gives a different kind of feeling
It's a new kind of dealing, it's a special kind of healing (uh huh)
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz? You know what it is
Positive over negative, see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster (that's right)
I rise up above
See, people still showing me love
Got the respect without dropping a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new hit, you can pop in the deck
It's beautiful

[Hook]
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is brand new Uptowns still in the box
This is the Yankees, 10-nothing, killing the Sox
This ain't hugging the block with a gat in your hand
This is Boca Raton on a catamaran (that's right)
With the sun beaming down where you at in the sand
I feel like I'm more than a cat with a plan
This feels like it's more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in your hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
That's why I stole this mic, y'all don't hold this right (nope)
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack, no a glass of Henny (that's right)
Now drink it up 'til there ain't nothing left in it
I'm repping it, BK, that's a definite
Just more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(I'm wishing on a, on a, on...) the most beautifullest thing ever
And it's here to bring terror to the bling era (yeah)
You can feel it in your inner
It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving dinner
It's like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark (swish)
It's that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat gon' use it
I see a black man aiming his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claiming his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down with Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it cause it brought us here
It's a young mother braiding her daughter's hair
It's beautiful

[Hook][Consequence]
Excuse me I beg your pardon?
Nah, wha-wait hold up hold up hold up hold up
Bitch you don't
I don't get paid enough for you to be talkin to me like that
Straight up and down
I don't feel like standing by the fucking front door, alright?
You know what? Matter fact, a year from now
When you at home on your only day off and you watchin UPN
You see me come up there and get my motherfuckin award
Tell yo' kids I said

How'd I get stuck in a dead-end job when I can rap
But of course my bill collectors they ain't tryna hear that
Matter fact they askin Dexter when I plan to pay back
On that long line of credit that they lent me way back
Way back, way back, at the turn of the century
The notice they sent to me is sayin essentially
If I don't pay that balance off along with a extra fee
Penitentiary or criminal charges
Probably soon to follow if you dare disregard this
And that got me nauseous, and feelin precautious
Cause the fruits of my labor, ain't barin no harvest
At least as a artist cause AT LEAST as a artist
You become whoever when your time get the hardest
But who you 'sposed to call when they all think you garbage
And figured that you washed up, damn they so heartless
Cause when I called the office they act stiffer than starches

[Hook]
And this just ain't where I'm 'sposed to be
This just ain't where I'm 'sposed to be
This just ain't where I'm 'sposed to be
This just ain't where I'm 'sposed to be
Cause this just ain't where I'm 'sposed to be
This just ain't where I'm 'sposed to be
This just ain't where I'm 'sposed to be
This just ain't, this just ain't

[Consequence - over Hook]
Man... I gotta make my next move my best move
Cause there ain't no food in the fridge SON WHAT YOU DOIN~?!
C'mon son, we can't be, son we can't be out there like that
The hold ain't even tight no more, no more
Son WHAT'S REALLY GOOD~! Ahh.... man

[Consequence]
Now I'm in a situation that I can't pacify
So I'm lookin through the papers skimmin through the classifieds
When I see an opportunity that can't pass me by
That I can get the job if I give this class a try
Put my pride to the side, go get a 9 to 5
Cause livin check to check's the only way that I survive
But yo they sorta lied cause the lead's certified
It take more than shirts and ties for the course that they provide
But the course they would provide, a means of employment
Which is basically a job that I'll soon be annoyed with
So this unemployment is now subject to change
Cause I'm on these interviews and I'm runnin my game
And I'm bein interviewed by my government name
And I'm Ollie out the crew that we one and the same
So for now I'm out the game and far away from recordin
Cause they left a message sayin that I start Monday mornin

[Phone message]
Hello, this is OCS callin for Dexter Mills
Dexter, we have work for you on Monday mornin
At our Banana Republic, on Broadway and Spring Street in Lower Manhattan
You are to be there at ten o'clock in the mornin
Please call us back and let us know your availability

{*conversation between Consequence and his mom about the job follows..*}
{*moms is mad that he still wants to hit the recording studio at night*}[Intro: Consequence]
Let me hear you say (HEY) get money (HEY)
Get money (HEY) get money (HEY)
Get money (HEY) get money (HEY)
Now let's go

[Hook: Consequence]
Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first
So if you ain't bustin down, please disperse (uh)
Please disperse (uh) please disperse
I know I never should've bought that tease the purse, uhh

[Consequence]
But homie that's what happens when your {dick} in the dirt
And I guess that's what happens when your whip's in reverse
And you on the Eastside between 2nd and 1st
And you pull up on the stunt, and she dressed as a nurse
And you tell her all the things you mighta hit in a verse
And surprisin to you, man the script really works
So she gives you all her numbers plus her name and the chirp
And you made sure it's right when you hit the alert
Then you call her up tomorrow and you scoop her from work
Then you bring her round the way and the crew go berserk
Now the only question left is really who's goin first
And if you can't find a condom then you go and search
And by the time you get back shorty's way more than burnt
And she done buttoned up her blouse, and pulled up her skirt
And now you ask her what's wrong, and what went wrong?
"If you can't get her calm then you really ain't a don"
Now she yellin out "Cons, you played yourself
I wish the playa that I met woulda stayed himself"
What made me say to myself, I need to drop this chick off
'Fore the police at the door and they blockin me off
Cause you know she's testifyin like a Christian in church
So I ain't have no other choice but tell the chick disperse

[Hook] - 2X

[Gangsta L. Crisis]
Drinkin Coronas in Pamona with Mona
From the Chi so I'm cold as pneumonia
A player they warned ya, about girl I'll put it on ya
Let me mack you down in this corner
Look like the type that look good in the mornin
E'ry time we bonin you moanin
Love they way I {fuck} you have you tellin your homies
Tryin to have {shit} on lock like the police
Get mad when the other {ho} know me
Especially cause they lovin my goatee, 'fore we was +Drivin Slowly+
Went to the West, tryin to ball like Kobe
And the cold broads, was all our trophies
Kept a main girl in the show piece
Lookin at that {bitch} low-key in the Oakleys
Love the way them hips is perfect - if you ain't tryin to show me
Baby you can start dispersin, that {shit} ain't workin

[Hook] - 2X

[Really Doe]
The venue's sold out, know I'm 'bout to snap
Three rows from the front, two seats to the right
Hit her with a pass, courtesy of the man
Kick it with the stars, bring a couple of friends
Let you meet 'Ye, yeah that's the fam
Track 14, that's your favorite jam?
Damn, I'm in town for the night
Take a sip of the potion and let's get right
Into some roleplay, be wifey
No paper, no time to autograph your tee
Spotted you on stage dancin all freaky
Now you're in the back, actin shy tweakin
This ain't "Meet the Parents," what the hell you thinkin?
This ain't the church and I ain't the deacon
Damn, I'm tryin to get you out them boots
And say the first thing on my mind like Luke
Sit back, and chill with the crew
Instead you got your mind on my money and my loot
Talkin 'bout "I came back to kick it
Let's exchange digits, fly me in, I'll visit"
Cool out, you gotta be kiddin
But leave your wristbands on the table, now beat it
Worse comes to worse my peoples come first (HEY)
If you ain't bustin down (HEY) disperse (HEY)
Disperse (HEY) disperse (HEY)
Disperse (HEY) disperse (hey)

Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first (uh)
So if you ain't bustin down, please disperse (uh)
Please disperse (uh) please disperse (uh)
Please disperse, please disperse

[Tony Williams harmonizes to the end][Hook: Target]
Bok kak' si kaj ima lima da li sve štima
Briješ odraslo al mislim da poslu još ni si dorast'o
Možemo zabrijat' u duetu radit' štetu
Jer nemre ti niko niš' na svijetu u pubertetu

[Verse 1: Target]

Bok kak' si kaj ima lima ha si brod'o
Ja sam šet'o Zagrebom dok ti još nisi ni hod'o
Pa znam kaj se događa znam uzroke raznih svađa
Sitnih krađa kako brije škvadra mlađa
Vele ti da moraš slušat starije
A kaj kad se stariji napiju i počnu radit pizdarije
Igrali smo murije i mafije, pandura i lopova
A sad od Vrapca do Sopota klinci fakat bježe od drotova
Priča je gotova, dobiješ dosje pa možeš mahat pa pa
Nebu te sad spasil ni tata
Utječeš na brata pa se bahati u osnovnjaku
Uvijek se izvuče za dlaku da ne primi šaku
Frend svakom lošem daku luta noću po mraku
Zna fintu svaku u k* pošalje baku
Veliš da nisi glup, al nemreš složit dvije poštene
Visiš po kvartu i izigravaš klošare
Ni da hoćeš nemreš bit ko starija ekipa
Pa briješ na tipa kaj stalno žica 50 lipa
Želiš sve pokušati piti i travu pušiti
Neću te dirat jer ni mi nismo htjeli slušati
Al ipak smo znali reć pardon i hvala
Ak već radiš gluposti nemoj ispast budala

[Verse 2: General Woo]

Tebi ovo je gala jer je škvadra iza stala
Al kad najviše zagusti tu će stajat samo mama
Vidiš brata kak je prošo, prije godinu je ošo
Nema ništa od mladosti samo zatvorske gadosti
Ti još možeš proć ko Bog zato lima ajde bok
Imaš 15 u guzici baci pivo popi sok
Ja se sjećam dok još nisi znao što su cigarete
Sad uzimaš slicke piješ pivo i tablete
Koji bonkaš i gotiva uvijek imaš heroina
Cijelo vrijeme si banana, ali zarada je fina
Imaš stariju cupi pa se znjaraš s njom na klupi
Zna da uvijek imaš dopa zna da ne mora da kupi
Samo raširi noge i zamisli hrpu droge
Svako svakom kaže hvala lima baš si budala
Dal čitaš statistike iz kriminalistike
Puno ljudi popuši metak zbog velike balistike
Ne ideš u školu imaš uličnu diplomu
Imaš muda za dalje i kada završiš u domu
Svako prevari sistem, nađe rupu u zakonu
Nisi pazio pozdravi svog buraza u zatvoru

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Target]

Kaj ima lima čujem da ti buraz ima čkupi
Hoće nekaj da joj kupi, al pokloni su preskupi
Pa da budemo glupi jer mi se digla stvarčica
Zbog ukradenih gaćica sad te ganja prodavačica
Al nije u bedu sve je u najboljem redu
Jer pokro je dedu po noći s utorka na srijedu
Da počasti Nedu i da vrati ostatak dugova
Da sa škvadrom iz drugih krugova ne bu sukoba
Nemoj mi reć da je popušil kaj je trebo prodat
Stuko je klinca u školi kaj ga je htio odat
Ne mogu vjerovat kak ti sad brije brat
Čuo sam da nemre prestati srat i svima nudi sat
A sjećam se kad smo ga slali po vodu poslije tekme
Sad prati modu ti ležiš na podu ak te zvekne
A kaj mu samo kaže stara
Dal zna da po kvartu hara skriva žizu iza ormara
Nemre mu niš jer ga za sve boli kara
Uglavnom ju na koljena obara
Ko da se za njega ne stara radi non-stop da smogne para
A stari je otišo jer ga je našla da ju vara
Damn fakat ide nizbrdo kad jednom krene
Zato pazi na sebe da te okolina ne sjebe
A svom glupom bratu reci da se javi
Da ga škvadra sastavi kada se nađemo na kavi

[Verse 4: General Woo]

Voliš li još iste stvari žene i provode
Tebe stoti put već privode dok ljudi rade tulume
A di si ti u sobi velkoj dva sa dva
Zar se ne sjećaš vremena Zule Dovbje ti i ja
Sve dok nisi uzo palicu da stučeš onu dvojcu
Skinuo ih bose uzo hlače i majcu
Pa su poslali maricu da te fura u stanicu
Buraz ti je isti jučer opljačko je staricu
Ko da vidim tebe u njemu ima istu semu
Neće čut savjet glumi osobu gluhonjemu
Fura se po kvartu radi sranja di god stigne
Ima stila za kriminal uvijek neku lovu digne
Uvjek pozdravi starije koji ne rade piz*
Gledali smo uživo kak bježi od murije
I sada ga ispituju on glavom samo klima
Laže drotove u oči jer njegov buraz je lima[Strick]
Yeah, big Strick, let's get it on...
Yo, last night I had a nightmare that I was wack
Nope, I'm sorry, it's that you said something dope
Fuck it, it don't matter, cause I know shit ain't really like that
Cause if you said something dope, I know somebody else probably had to write that
You on the wrong song an' I'm on the right track
I hit the cypher, and you bounce talkin' 'bout "Strick, I'll be right back!"
What the fuck you comin' back for?
I pulled up to the front of the club and hurried and scurried up out the back door
Just in time 'fore your ass got a cracked jaw
Made cause I stack more, and what the Lakers sign Shaq for?
Incredible rhymer, what the hell am I sell crack for?
I'm real, you a ac-tor, I'm hot, you just not a fac-tor
You on some 'bout to do, I'm on some already done shit
I'll burn you with the same light you just lit up your blunt wit'
And I done came wit' the style you probably 'bout to come wit'
You the opposite of smart faeces, get it? Dumb shit
Could give a fuck who you run wit'
Or them niggas you 'bout to go get
Matter of fact, go get 'em, you'll just be layin' on the floor wit' 'em
Lookin' up at me talkin' 'bout: "Why you let the fo-fo hit 'em?
I really don't know these niggas, I just did a show wit' 'em
Went back to the telly and I hit a couple of hoes wit' em
Met 'em at the studio an' just spit a couple of flows wit' 'em
Bought a bag of dro and just sat back and got high wit' 'em"
Oh yeah, that's good to know, now you 'bout to die wit' 'em
Head straight to the pearly gate, say hi to the big guy wit' 'em
Or take it to that other level, down with the devil and fry wit' 'em
Grumble and groan, piss and moan, boo-hoo and cry wit' 'em
Atleast go home and tell his momma bye bye wit' 'em (bye, momma)
Cause duke, I'm the hottest nigga on earth right now
And bust my gun in nine months 'bout to give birth right now
Run all up in a nigga hood and take his turf right now
Nothing's what your life is worth right now
I've been in shit for too long, it's about time I burst
A & R's ready to quit cause they ain't find me first
Record labels ready to shut down cause they ain't sign me first
So let me stop right now cause I know y'all niggas be dieing to be writing
My verse

[Hook: Young Zee]
If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve at night to the cracks o' dawn
Got girls in the back takin' off they thongs
Then feelin' that something's wrong!

If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve a.m. to the early morn'
If you seen them things then blow ya horn
Cause if ya not there's something wrong!

[Masta Ace]
I came outta rap training camp as a reigning champ
An' lay motherfuckers down just like the pain of a cramp
I won't stop 'til I see my name and my face on a stamp
And y'all still won't be able to stick me or fuck wit' me
I'm 'bout to leave my mark on this game like a buck fifty
Took shots but I duck swiftly, you just missed me
Fuck Alice, ????, Norton and fuck Trixie
I'mma fuck like it's my honeymoon 'til I touch sixty
You ain't a thug so don't try to get tough with me
If you think about tryna hit me, you'll get snuffed quickly
Deep down, hate Bobby Brown, but love Whitney
At times I wish it was O.J and the glove fit me
Then I wouldn't have to hear none of you wack niggas
Talk about how your crew's rich and you stack figures
In my hand's a chrome gun with a black trigger
I know you think your shit's big, but I pack bigger
Just ask your wife, cause I blasted her pipes
If I tell Strick to pass me a knife would you ask for your life?
You's a pussy, I can tell by your song
Homo/thug rapper, I can tell by your thong
Got sugar in your tank, you probably shit syrup
The world's about to see what it is when I hit Europe
And when I come back on for my birthday
I'mma do another video, too explicit to play

[Hook]

[Young Zee]
Ace, Zee, yo Strick, Bricks, Zee, Outsidaz, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Niggas fear me like the fear of Aids
I take out pretty boys wearin' shades
Or thug niggas with they hair in braides
Then fuck yo' girl through that thing she wearing
Get her pregnant to leave that bitch a single parent
Got mad cars, you probably ain't been in a Jaguar
Drunk at Justin's, while you hang out at a fag bar
Scared at jail, but at home you tryna rob
When you got inside you got sodomized by a lotta guys
Girls pile up in Young Zee room
I fucked the wives of about twenty grooms on they honeymoons
We had a check sellin' bottles of rock
An' so much dope came we re-modelled the spot
That's why y'all cats spittin' ??????????
See you grinnin' when I stop and the rims keep spinnin'
Fuck with Zee I'll bash ya face
I'll fucks wit' {*scratches*} Masta Ace, bitch[Verse 1:Target]
Ja, poslušaj pažljivo kaj pričam
Jer svaki put rokam sažeto
Ravno iz grada di je Dinamo ime sveto
Još jedno pakleno ljeto, da li si ikad prošet'o
Širim centrom kaj više liči na geto?
Pa skočil do kvarta na kavu
Posjetil predgrađe, gdje je klincima najslađe
Napraviti sitne krađe, obrstiti trešnju
Kiosk zbog pljuga il ledo škrinju
Da ublaže vrućinu, djeca su pa ne brinu
Adrenalin se diže k'o temperatura zraka
Otkucaj srca junaka, pozdravi škvadra svaka
Ili tišina il' plaka plaka dok kruže danju
Ili pod zaštitom mraka, ko majstori nunčaka
Zagrebačka fjaka ko posljedica čistaka
Ljeto je u kvartu svih izgubljenih dječaka
Nada nestala bez traga, kao I draga
Pa nema interesa za prijelaz kvartovskog praga
Ima nas kaj čitamo novine u carstvu hladovine
U praznom bircu kao I prošle godine
Osjećam k'o da ni'ko ne voli me, al' boli me
Ak' hoćeš moje društvo nazovi me I zamoli me

[Hook: Target, General Woo]x2

Na užarenom betonu odrasli, škvadru našli
Gledali razne promjene vlasti, nekak' se snašli
Sami sebe pronašli I ustali iz blata,...
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta...

[Verse 2: General Woo]

Odvoji sranje od istine, 'ko su klošari?
Mladi bez budućnosti, na drogama k'o žohari
Nemoćni, al' opasni jer dolaze iz kvarta
Sjebali bi brata zbog vrućine asfalta
Odgovori mi onda,tko su đaneri I pijanci
Mafijaši I gangsteri što ih zovete kriminalci
Zarađujemo na crno, neki manje, neki više
Al' kad jednom te sklempaju, uvijek isto ti se piše
Danas puno ih dila, većina hrpa je debila
Sjebu se u startu jer nisu imali stila
Neki rade zbog zarade, robu troše na sebe
Papci su se zakačili, pa onda 'ko ih jebe
Klinci 'oće bit' tajkuni, curice bogatašice
Neki kriminalom, a neki pomoću pičkice
I srce mi se kida, ovdje živimo bez stida
Dobre stvari su nestale kao nekad Atlantida

[Target]

Bože, daj mi hlada
Jer vražja temperatura ne pada
Sam se borim sa Suncem
Jer su drugi pobegli iz grada
Ljutit pred njim I sav se znojim
Da li zato kaj me kuje
Il zato kaj se bojim
Htjel bi krvi da mu se napojim
Da mu pokažem zakaj postojim
Isto sa njim il' tipom bilo kojim
Ponovo izbroje kaj frajer calta
Dobro došli u drugi dio vrućine gradskog asfalta!
Za sve kaj su ustali iz blata
Jer ne trpe sranja već žele dio zasluženog poštovanja
Poznate znate, a druge ne mogu da uhvate
Frankfurtska veza brate, za sve Hrvate
Nisi kužio spiku, pa si sad na na trajnom počinku
Još jedna mrlja krvi na pločniku
Kaj će izbljedit na Suncu kaj fura nesnosnu vrućinu
Nevine žrtve poćivale u miru!

[Hook]x2

[Verse 3: General Woo]

Ak' je vani 35, na asfaltu je duplo
Od vrućine me boli jer je u glavi nešto puklo
Papci su pali, nova promjena vlasti
Tajkune u zatvor, da bi novi mogli krasti
Mama mi je rekla budi dobar I fin
S ovim privlačim pozornost kao papke heroin
Zato pogledaj mi rane, dal' prepoznaješ krv?
Rulja ždere ovaj asfalt kao pokojnika crv
Zato k'o je s nama, s nama je
'Ko nije, k nama je
I drolja, buraz, dama je, dok kuja ne zalaje
Jer tanka je linija između cuge I pljuge:
Jedni mlate velku lovu, a svi ostali su sluge
Mnogi motaju duge jer dugački su dani
Uroka ne znam što bi značila riječ "stani"
Situacija je jebena, uroka ni od pelena
Vrućina gradskog asfalta, stimulacija zelena

[Outro: Target, General Woo]

Aha, na vrućini gradskog asfalta, škvadra iz svakog kvarta
Jer od pelena do groba, u bilo koje doba
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Od šaranja po betonu I slušanja o bontonu
Do šatre o babilonu I treba na fukodromu
Sa starcima il' frendom, rokamo svojim redom
U fajtu sa bedom
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Jer rolamo pljugu
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Di ispijamo cugu
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Uz sreću I tugu
Na vrućini gradskog asfalta
Za ljude iz kvarta za sve iz kvarta[Hook: Masta Ace]
What's up to everyone, that's in the place to be
I'm glad we could come together, we making history
You won't see this again, in half a century
Telling you who we be, eMC

[Wordsworth]
Yo!, I'm Wordsworth, W.W., Words for short
Mirror Music, solo LP, y'all heard my thoughts
Yet I'm humble but I'm confident
Sophisticated and provocative
Novelist without all the obvious monotonous
Many other acomplishments
Plus songwriter, story telling and battle rhyming
I was born brighter
Being from Brooklyn, New York
It's just naturally comes
MC and poet, all packed into one

[Stricklin]
Aiyyo, What up?
My name is Stricklin, from Milwaukee, US
Yeah I can sing, I can dance, but see I talk to you best
I done did a lot of things but what I ought to do next
Is explain how M3 done simply brought you the best
I been signed to many labels who I fought to impress
They ain't hear me tho, so I had to walk with the rest
I deserved much more, but they offered me less
So here I be with eMC, who you thought was the best? What?

[Hook]

[Punchline]
I'm Punchline, Lower Eastside, the place I reside
One Half of Punch & Words, competition get served
These labels works my nerves, tried killing my vibe
But I received a gold plaque by doing records with Tribe
Grammy nominated, my position validated, niggas took my style and ate it
Lyricist Lounge Show, yeah we made it
I love hoes, keep my mind on my dough
Im sorta like Terrence Howard cause I Hustle and Flow

[Masta Ace]
Yeah, I'm Masta Ace from Brownsville, Brooklyn
Where many-a-chain is snatched and pocket book tooken
Taken, it's also the home of Central Booking
Cats are stealing checks off your Nikes if you not looking
I went five albums deep, while half the world would sleep
Once wrote a speech about the system in my jeep
From 1988 to 2000 and change
It's incredible I'm still doing my thing, it's a blessing

[Hook][Verse 1: Sunny Bizness & Bosca]
Der Asphalt ist kalt, ich seh Hass und Gewalt
"Let me tell you 'bout my life" War nur Spaß
Eigentlich ist' ganz OK, ich red' jetzt mal klartext
Ich beam mich von Frankfurt nach Zagreb (Deutschrap)
Den Kopf voll mit Bars, das Gepäck voller Gras packs
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"
Ja, ich reis' meinem Traum hinterher und greif' nach den Stern'
"Let me tell you 'bout my life" Wir waren alles am verlieren
Doch holen das, was wir verdient haben, wieder
Und [?] nach Texten voller Hass dann einen von Frieden [?]
Und haben die Scheiben gescratched
Wählen unser eigenes Recht
Doch du kannst [?] auf den Jungen ohne [?]
Nix zutun mit allen Meetings und Catering
Doch kenn' Dinge, außer Arbeit, die für Miete das Geld bring'
Mit den Besten aus mei'm Kreis, komm und teste mich am Mic
Also "Let me tell you 'bout my life"

[Hook: Sunny Bizness, Bosca, Born & Bagdad]
Und wir wussten, dieser Weg wird nicht einfach sein
Denn wir haben alles gesehen und wir haben alles erreicht
Und wir liefen gegen Berge, Fels und Stein
Wir wollten alles verstehen, als wär' das alles so leicht
Wir schreiben Zeilen für die Ewigkeit
Wir hatten so viel vor, nur zu wenig Zeit
Doch wir kämpfen immer weiter, weil sonst eh nichts bleibt
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"

[Verse 2: Born & Bagdad]
Als ich nichts hatte, war die ganze Scheiße nicht leicht
Ich mein', "Let me tell you 'bout my life", wenn die Zeit reicht
Schicksal, nenn es, wie du willst, ist egal
Auch wenn ich nichts hab, füllt diese Stimme einen Saal
Vom Feinstaub zum Ausblick, von Rauschgift weg, aha
"Let me tell you 'bout my life" Und was ist jetzt?
Jetzt ist es so, dass die Kohle gerad' reicht, und eins:
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"
Es geht um Ruhm und Musik, Flus und Haschisch
Auf der Suche nach Frieden zwischen Booth und der Street
Einem Leben zwischen Leid, Mut und viel Krieg
Gib der Wut ein Ventil, sag, "Let me tell you 'bout my life"
In meinem Land fließt noch Blut wie Benzin
Und Menschen sterben täglich nach dem Zufallsprinzip
Was für "Zukunftsmusik"? Hier sind Kugeln im Spiel
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"

[Hook: Sunny Bizness, Bosca, Born & Bagdad] (x2)

[Sample + Scratches]
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"

[Verse 3: Sunny Bizness]
Siehst du, wie ich von ganz unten nach den Sternen greif'
"Let me tell you 'bout my life" Nichts ist, wie es scheint
Nur weil ich gerne positive Mukke mach'
Heißt es nicht, mein Leben wäre leicht
Nein, ganz im Gegenteil, ich zahlte für meine Fehler den Preis
"Let me tell you 'bout my life"
Ich mach'n Cut mit der Vergangenheit
Ich mach'n Cu-Cu-Cut (Scratches) Cut mit der Vergangenheit
(Scratches) Ich mach'n Cut mit der Vergangenheit
Und tausche Tränen gegen Schweiß
Ich mach'n Cu- (Scratches) Cut mit der Ver- (Scratches)
Ich mach'n Cut mit der Vergangenheit

Aiyo, what up party people (Yeah, my name's on the guest list)
This is the Wallabee kingpin in the building (As Mr. Maygreen... good evening...)
Right about now, I'm about to show you how good we are (I'm in the club, I'm)

[Hook: Mr. Maygreen]
(Good), I look so, (good), the car look
(Good), I'm in the hood, and I'm okkkkkk
(Good), the jewels look, (good), the girls look
(Good), they all from around the wayyyyy
(Good), hey there, (good), look at you
(Good), me, I'm just passing byyyyyyy
(Good), look at her, (good), time out
(Good), I think I'll give the game a tryyyyy

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, my rose was good, plus my face was good
The way I wear my jeans up over my boots is hood
And my cash is good, the grass, spread it out, over the hash is good
The grasp who be hypecast is good
That's the bird that fucked the game up
Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cuz I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood
And we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up
And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose
Cuz they shit is too fat like an adidas sole
Don't even touch my gold, I'm good

[Hook: Mr. Maygreen]
I know you heard it a thousand times
Not quite like my design
You say that's what you looking for
Gator boots walk through the door, now

[Bridge: Ghostface Killah (Mr. Maygreen)]
(Good) Theodore's good, (good), my team is good
(Good) My robes is good, (I'm so good)
(Good) My moms is good, (good), my style is good
(Good) My queen is good, yeah, come on, (I'm so good)
(Good) The days is good, (good), babies is good
(Good) Wifes is good... uh-huh
(Good) The hood is good, (good), God is good
(Good) Everything is good, come on, let's go

[Ghostface Killah]
Goose over ice cubes, pass the O.J
Two light skinned wizzes, want Ghost, on both ways
Come here, sit on my lap, it's not a gat, sugar
Have a seat, don't be afraid to move back
Feel that? You'se a nasty girl
Big butt, slim gut, I'll crash your world
It's not polite to bend over in Starkey face
Sheer lace, fat ass, got want me to taste that
Lodi dodi, with a coke shaped body
And my jewels hang low like my balls in the potty
And I dare ya'll to try to rob me
Theodore U, we got the army
A-Town to Mariner's Harby
Wild West, Now Born, go hard, G
Killa Hill, Stapletown, Port Rich' kids
Pack heat, like I was pulling out biscuits

[Hook]

[Trife Da God]
When we on the block bubbling rocks, watching for cops
Holding Glocks in and out of the spots, (it's all good)
When we overseas, getting that cheese, whipping the hottest V's
Blowin' exotic trees, playa, (it's all good)
When I'm in the whip, sunk in the six, drunk off the liqs
Pull up, stunting, fronting for chicks, (it's all good)
When we on stage getting them Grammy's, snatching them panties
Jetskiing off the shores of Miami, (it's all good)

[Hook]

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah... told ya'll before, another Theodore Production
This is how we go in the 06 to 07, come on, come on

[Hook][Sample]
You stay on my mind

[Part]
Du setzt mir die Pistole auf die Brust und gibst mir einen Kuss
Sagst, dass du mich liebst aber auch, dass du das machen musst
Der Finger noch am Abzug, die Kugel noch im Lauf
Sagst, ich soll mich jetzt entscheiden, ja dann blut' ich für mein'n Traum
Drück jetzt ab und zögern nicht, womöglich ist
Das hier ein Fehler, doch wir wissen, dass er nötig ist
Töte mich und alles was noch übrig ist, betrügen
Uns schon selbst viel zu lange, doch Gefühle sind nicht alles
Wie du selbst schonmal sagtest, worauf wartest du?
Entlade dein Magazin, meinen letzten Atemzug
Widme ich alleine uns, du hast mehr als einen Grund
Das hier zu beenden, doch gewähre mir noch einen Wunsch
Sag ein letztes Mal, wie sehr du mich doch liebst
Sag ein letztes Mal, wie sehr du mich doch brauchst
Schau noch ein letztes Mal in meine Augen
Lass mich nur noch einmal glauben, das mit uns
Könnte vielleicht doch noch laufen
Aber Zweifel nicht an deiner Tat
Sei dir sicher, deine Lüge begleitet mich bis in's Grab
Frag dich nicht, ob es richtig ist, du weisst, dass du mir wichtig bist
Und deswegen ist es wichtig, dass du mich vergisst
Räche dich, wenn du nicht schiessen kannst, ersteche mich
Nehm das Messer, wenn es dir leichter fällt und besser ist
Ramm's mir in mein Herz, damit der Schmerz endlich aufhört
Wenn ich ehrlich bin, dann hab ich tausend Sachen, die mich auch stören
Der Geist, der ist willig, doch das Fleisch, das ist schwach
Zieh' 'nen Schlussstrich, bitte mach's, weil ich es alleine nicht schaff'
Denn ich liebe dich - aber verdien' dich nicht
Drück ein letztes Mal dein Auge zu, ziele und erschiesse mich (*Schuss*)[Verse One]
As I recall it
I first started to only get dap
To show the cats on my block and in my school that I could rap
They knew me as a B-Boy
Now I burst a verse and added piece to my collection
Twice that for the selection
I chose this direction cause I was an expert
At not only art, plus I had the ill footwork
Dancing supreme, flares, crabs, slice and windmill
Twelve years was the age, by then I had the will
I knew deep in my heart that if I came up with a scheme
To use my tools and my skills I'd fulfill my rap dreams
Started copping LP's as the years went by
Noticing the different styles and how MC's sound fly
P.E., J.B.'s, Rakim, Red Alert
KRS, Marley Marl, Juice Crew and B.L.S
The state of fresh plus a mess inbetween
That makes up my whole aura as an MC fiend

"Don't think you can before you start rapping" - Fat Joe
Labels, A&R, marketing schemes
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Looking at contracts and don't know what it mean
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Per diem, promo shows worth no doe
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know

[Verse Two]
To get my props as a pro I entered local talent shows
Cause I knew without my lessons my profession wouldn't grow
Battle cats in my school, in the street or in the club
Made a name for myself, everybody showed me love
But there was still something missing from my flavor of the month
So I sold out for a partner that was ill from the jump
Enter Tame One, lyric extrodinar
Two superb legionar, niggas couldn't compare
Slaying cats left and right, who performing tonight?
(That's them!)
Damn right, known to always be nice
Count was minimal but we didn't gain respect
Till 89.9, Bob and Armstrong Stretch
Official to the world or shall I say the industry
Now we hit from Dirty Jers' with the shit for NYC
Cause where we at, Jersey already on the map
So we uphold tradition so enters Artifacts

[Scratch Hook]
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Executives in your ear telling you, you the shit
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Until your album comes out and there's nobody buying it
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Check the soundscan, [?] to see your flow
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know

[Verse Three]
Aight, the year is '94 and we signed a record deal, put your boots on
Big Beat/Atlantic was the shield
On the real, the first album was a dope experience
Hear my voice on wax over T-Ray instruments
Hitting tours and all
From a song talking 'bout writing on the wall
Many thought we had balls
We knew it was the plan, laid the whole program
Between A Rock And Hard Place, the label didn't understand
Example yo, my nigga listen to this
We would've blown from a vid' off the Busta remix
Second album mad pressure but we did that shit
Came with The Ultimate, a plaque, one tour, we split
Now the whole world shaking cause they knew that we was breaking
No more cans to be shaking, know the scores that we was lacing
From this I took a two year break and I was back
Cause I can't be stopped from getting mine, fuck that

[Hook]
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
How it affects your life and how those around you feel your strife
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Whether you like it or not, the hottest MC can get dropped
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Keep your day job, messing with this you get robbed
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"[Verse One]
I was born in the beast's belly
Running through the streets smelly
Daytime, summer hot like a fleece skully
Running 'round, no shirt on, throwing dirt bombs
Chasing little girls that had skirts on
If we wasn't on the block then we going swimming
Public pool, feeling the butts of grown women
Little shorties trying to stroke ass
Swam in our shoes cause on the bottom was broke glass
On two hand touch I had a nice team
After the game, nana threw down money for ice cream
Yup, and Good Humor had the best stock
Some days I had to chase the truck to the next block
And if we got in a fight, you might get it
I was quick to pick up some shit and hit a nigga wit it
It didn't matter, either bottle or stick, or a half a brick
I look back and I laugh at the shit
I had four different fights with the same guy
I won two, lost one and one was a tie
We always kept score like that
It was raw like that
I kinda wish now was more like that
It's funny how the hood make you, it could break you
If your mind ain't strong enough then it could take you
I used to wish that I could rise above it
I'd love it
But I was too young to understand the size of it

[Hook]
They say the name of the game is "survival"
Open the door I'm alive on arrival
And when I'm in I ain't trying to leave
You don't know what I'm trying to achieve
I'm trying to breathe

(Just breathe) Just breathe {x6}
Uh huh, just breathe

[Verse Two]
By the time I hit the age of 16 I wanted major cream
On the block, trying to shine like a laser beam
If you had the Gucci frames then the coochie came
It was all about the cats that had designer names
I couldn't get the shit that some got
I didn't sell crack rock, I didn't have a wicked jump shot
I was known for rapping, keeping it popping
Finally I got a summer job, sweeping and mopping
Bringing home like four and some change was so strange
No more wearing them jeans with no names
I started dressing trying to out flash
So Fresh and So Clean clean like I was Outkast
A couple friends had another route
If they thought she had money on her, they'd knock your mother out
I had to see we wasn't kids now
Same cats that played on the block with was doing bids now

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
From the past up until the present
To growing up and reaching adulthood from an adolescent
I see them 20 inch rims, I understand why you got those
Riding through Brooklyn, hitting potholes
It's just a way to tell yourself that you finally made it
Don't give a damn if the rest of the world kind of hate it
Nobody understand the wild type of shit we facing
And all we had to do to rise above the situation
They don't understand the platinum chains and ice rings
They don't realize we never had no nice things
I'll always remember, how I started out though
Don't ever forget, how it was without doe
This feels good like a swim in the gym
Representing for my women and men, feel me again
C'mon

[Hook][Chorus 2x: Masta Killa]
What you see, ah, you ain't seen nothing yet
Ah, you ain't seen nothing yet, ah, you ain't seen nothing yet
I thought told you

[Verse 1]
What you see is what you get
And you don't see and don't respect
You must be blind and can't detect
That I am from that BK set
Where Bible men flex big chains round necks
Wet late night sex, big dice game vets
Sweat, no threat, north, south, east, west, Weed gun men bet
Then all run it down, it's all good, I thought I told you
Any mother step in the square, I bet I fold you
Rhyming on timing, I shine like I'm suppose to
Nothing come close to son, it don't suppose to son
I thought I told you

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
Get funky like Lucy on the bass guitar
Make the ladies wanna drop they pants, lose they bra
I guess it just comes with the life of a star
Fly jets out of air force base, down in Shaw
I know you never heard it like this before
Real slick when he talk, the East New York walk
We can Iron Mic spar, ten paces then draw
Raw 'caine, straight from the grain, the royal Lion King
Keep it raw, hit the floor, heavyweight word
Break a man jaw on the floor, that's what you pay for
Sold eyes towards the broad, and like the mic strike
Thunder like the hammer of Thor, and keep it rough, sun
