[Verse 1: Reema Major]
I’m that chick and I’m that chick

[Verse 2: Reema Major]
The way I curve into my jeans (fifty), in my twenties (five)
When it comes to payin' em' attention
I ain’t spending a penny
Anybody I want it, I swear I want it like fast boy?
Go try me! I puts you know that I'mma pretty little girl that'll knock you out
Get that doughs what I’m about
Drop down to the ones that doubt. can’t take heat, don’t take this route
Yeah! I’m the youngest CEO, couldn’t show me with a free throw, oh no
Can’t see to the TO, she don’t want me with me, bro
You hate your bank account, I love my bank account
I’mma just go and buy it. Ain’t tripping on 'em now
I'm blessed than holly fever, hella cute and hella major
Any little thing that I want that I get
So I down my window, wave to the haters!

Chorus: (x2)
I’m get it on it, you know I’m on it, they say go!
Ain’t fucking on it, you know I run it, oh yeah go!
From the illest kid, every time you know, now go!
I'm the one
Nanananana boo boo
I’m the one![Verse 1: Reema Major]

Front is the opposite of back
White is the opposite of black
I be killin' every track
Cus I'm the opposite of wack
In fact, I lack nothin' less than the fake shit
They creatin' numerous rumors tryna create shit
Saying false facts that really ain't me
Why these critics always tryna tarnish my identity
In this life, a lawyer is a liar
The new generations is inspired by the errors that came prior
For example, piercings on the face
Came from the Messiahs in the motherland
Understand, nothing's new under the sun
Nowadays everybody got a gun
But not every gun got a body
Yes, we're identified by names
That don't mean using somebody
And the media can turn a goodie girl into a naughty one
This life is a bitch in itself
My concern is my family's health and their wealth
C'mon

[Chorus]

I want everything in this life
I'll join everything in this life

[Verse 2: Reema Major]

Truth be told
I'm as bold as I wanna be
Blunted in the backward
Far from a wannabe
I'ma take it all like it's sitting right in front of me
No set of eyes has ever seen what I wanna see
My life abides by the laws of the book
I been through situations that'll make a grown man shook
Grown man hide, type to make a grown man cry
If it don't come through and you never try
Don't you ask why
Work brings results, lazy brings nada
The lady sold her soul just cus she wanted some Prada
Then she gave up her coochie just cus she wanted Gucci
Nowadays we praisin' names like "bad bitch" and "mama hoochie"
That's so wrong, we prolong on what's right
And if it's going down, shots fired on sight
That's life, the one bitch you can't leash
I'm Reema M, the one kid you can't teach

[Chorus][Verse 1: Reema Major]
I’m that chick and I’m that chick

[Verse 2: Reema Major]
The way I curve into my jeans (fifty), in my twenties (five)
When it comes to payin' em' attention
I ain’t spending a penny
