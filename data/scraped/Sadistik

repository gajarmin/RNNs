[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Veins like a roadmap, black cold grasp on a throat that
Won’t hold back old habit, Kodak moments go past
I wrote stains on a toe-tag, old man made me so sad
That no taste of the Cognac or Prozac antidote, twist my skull
Off with his head, head like a hole Nine Inch Nails pressed to the bone
Exit alone, try and fail, I’ve inhaled dead to the world
Ethanol on your pedestal, churn chemical burns
Hurt worse than skeletal, so skeptical at first, perfect
Cursive in Hell, sweet silver bells all seem to say "Please go away”
Demons will play, eating away, new young and old, food for the soul-
Less that you know, the less that you feel
I'm cursed with intelligence I can't heal
Kneel, kill, death to the bourgeois, proletariat with the new song
Noose on a bony neck, loneliness, opiate and a bruised jaw
Allah’s not, nobody owns me, no job, robot, no cold feet
No God, only strong no home, no soul sold so-so so long

[Hook: Lotte Kestner]
Watch the paint peel
Slow as the burn you feel
Break the heart you never should've
You can bury anything
In the woods

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
I'm a live wire in a dead world, I'm a good boy, but I'm a better girl
Eyes closed, finger on the trigger, one inch different I'm free
You’re a widow, liquor liver, Suboxone under my tongue
Private numb, one more time for dying young
I had fun, watching father try to run, but he left a black hole inside his son
If we're being Frank, I'm an average Joe, cop shop
Jake and Johnny, Jack and Coke, your tsunami of only
Honestly couldn't even reach the back row
So how do you expect to drown me, dumbfound me or harm me
You and what army, are we clear, I'm here
In a rearview mirror, coming to a theater near you
To steer you away from your fears, stage bound
Usually it's break-a-leg, she told me to break a heart
I didn't know what to say exactly so I walked away
And later thought I should've at least told her thanks
But that's how that goes, where the grass grows
There’s a past in the time capsule, I'm attracted to its shadow
Every last drip 'til I'm flat broke
Let’s make this storm feel clean, coward man war machine
Sour plans, plots and schemes, ripened fruit, rotten dreams
Thoughtlessly, I told a lie, nothing I won't do to save my own behind
I'm a live wire burning dead inside
But I'm not dead, I'm not dead, I'm not dead until I've died

[Outro: Eyedea]
Yeah, cut your wrists on a blade of glass
I can't change my past but I can kiss the now and make it last
Take out the trash, crash, burn, another relapse
Turn rehashed meat perhaps
There's an in-between smile and frown behind your mask[Verse 1: Sadistik]
I'm a victim of an over-active limbic system
Follow me and you will know the madness that I live in
No magic, just an open casket criticism
Carry me inside or you can bury me alive right
When we met it was innocent enough
I said "Hi it's nice to meet you I am mister self destruct
I'm in your blood you're a victim of the rush
But you're flirting with disaster when you kiss and tell my love
Make more beds of nails so you can stay warm
Sang chords in a medley 'til my face tore
Pray for living dead that walk and pace forth
Rain pours in my head, it's called a brainstorm
This game you're playing is so tedious
Black out on white lies and blame it on bulimia
Yea, now I'm saying all your secrets huh
Should've thought twice before you grazed with your demon's touch
No disrespect but the real love doesn't show
'til I kiss your neck and my steel tongue cuts your throat
I feel numb when the tears run uncontrolled
Like it's synthemesc and I steal some of your soul
Until the self-help starts
When you'd bite my heart to see if it was really made of gold
I extinguished flames until hell fell dark
And buried bodies under floorboards like Tell Tale Heart, so run

[Hook: Yes Alexander]
I will watch you pray
As the steel shaft enters your brain
Tell me baby how many times
One thousand tries
And you're still alive

[Verse 2: Cage]
I don't really think that I'm often ill
What would you wear to death a cross or nil
Should've known she was only out to fill
Some sort of void I was out to kill
Any time left was the sand that fell
Anything to keep me from standing still
Spend it like you happened to land a mil
Wake up throwing up random pills
You want to feel it under your bones in your marrow
You hope cupid ran off with more arrows
Better off in passage ways to find pharaohs
When the road you walk is too narrow
Start flying stop falling
Like you did when you first stopped crawling
Threw it all on the table and went all in
Cause I knew it had to be my calling

[Sadistik]
Nothing's what it seems, life is but a dream
And I'm busy sleepwalking to find out what it means[Verse 1]
Teeth marks on the skin
The greatest trick the devil ever played was to take away my friend
I got your face engraved into my flesh
So I can try to make amends with that day I won't forget
In Minnesota I flew in so that we could both record
Me and Kristoff Krane were supposed to go on tour
Nobody answered, we were knocking on your door
And when they carried out your body, I was staring at your shoes on the floor
Still the answers never come
Your funeral was beautiful, it captured what you loved
I sat there in a stupor, fractured by the hugs
That I gave your family members, growing sadder by the months
But I won't dwell inside the ends
And that's not what you would want, you would tell me find connections
To the world and to tell it my confessions
The hell that I invest in is a part of something bigger
Words that you would write, they would carve into the center
Right on target 'til they start to fill my heart up with the letters
Shadows have shadows and it's darker than remembered
When this story has an ending to the part I had together with my friend

[Verse 2]
Absence makes the heart grow fonder of the time before the absence
And the nights spent trying to imagine
When you played I was blinded by the magic you displayed
I tried to reenact it in a way
I need the dark today to see the stars decay
Cause if I can fall asleep, then I can dream we are awake
Another shot of Jameson and PBR to chase
Another conversation in a seedy bar to play, right?
Man, this side of me's the worst
When I'm terrified that all I'll leave's a dynasty of dirt
But you believed in me and I believed your words
So in turn, I believed in things when I would need the courage
To move on, on and on and on and on it goes
When I'm nodding off an awful lot to songs that you had wrote
I want to honor all the art and progress that you showed
I miss my confidant and honest talks allotted on the phone
With you Mike -- I wish that I could hug you again
It's getting harder to pretend and I can't undo what's been
Thanks for being someone I could come to, a friend
I hope I make you proud -- I love you, the end

[Snippet of Micheal "Eyedea" Larsen, spoken]
Isn’t a person just a collection of their mistakes, and also their, kind of, undoing of their mistakes? I mean, what else are you? You know, you’re always…you’re always just the reaction to the bad parts of yourself, I think. And I think that’s what is kind of like, a driving motivation behind any human being that’s…who wants to continue to grow and live life. ‘Cause they’re looking at their flaws and trying to, go beyond it. And I think that a person, you know, essentially dies when they think that they found themselves, ya know? Unless you want to admit that you, yourself, are not an individual, and are just part of a whole…movement of ideas, and thought, and culture, and humanity and, furthermore, the universe, and everything -- unless you really feel like that, and you’re walking through walls, you know, you are always trying to find yourself. And it’s usually a person who believes that they’ve found “the answer” -- found “the end” -- that there actually is a psychological end. And then what’s the point of, you know, doing anything after that?[Hook]
1984
Everybody’s talking in that newspeak
Hiding all my thoughts in a loose leaf
1984
You can always find me where the goons creep
Underneath the solace of the moonbeams

[Verse 1]
There’s a bluebird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there’s a bluebird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Watching ceiling fans go ‘round, trying to catch the feelin’ off instrumental
Got my indo, and plus my papers for crescendos
Headphones against my temples
Pencil in my clutches, Jackson Pollack while he’s stenciling a subject (BANG)
And now I’m splattering the pain and such
Apple on your head and my aim is Naked Lunch
Stain-faded Chucks from the roads that I cross
Roads not taken, but no Robert Frost
So pale flames when I go Nabokov
With the inner-thought dialogue
I keep the steps quiet, inside my head’s riot
My heart beats (BANG), I leave the rest silent
Test driving pilot Kamikaze tired
On the Rockies watch me die in slow-motion like it’s 1984

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I sit inside my prison like I’m Winston with the gin
To scribble my addictions, or I’ll kill ‘em with the pen
Figurative or literal, I’ll stick it in the femoral
This devil won’t ever fall the victim to a trend
A penny for your thoughts at the bottom of a wishing well
Hit ‘em with the uppercut, they’re falling on a pit of nails
Fighting off the reptiles, Thompson on a Psilocybin
Binge been buzzed, molotovs are lit as well, their (eyes)
Are like a hawk when they writer’s block
Big brother’s always there, creeping in the shadows with their (eyes)
That like to watch when I try draw a
Piece like Frida Kahlo while I’m sleepless in Seattle
The skies here cry 365
Black clouds above me sing, “Eat shit and die!”
I’ll acquiesce, but I won’t give ‘em what they want
Or dignify their shit with a response, ‘cause it’s

[Hook][Intro]
Oh yeah, it's time they come down...down

[Hook]
Butterfly in the sky, I can fly twice as high

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
He said, "Fuck sobriety, death to the worker bees"
Thirteen circles I've stepped for eternity
Burning purple, stressed on a murder spree
It's self-inflicted, don't get it twisted
These knives in my back now, Elliott Smith(yeah)
Rides in the background, melodies fit (yeah)
Mixed with the misfits, fix is the hurt
When the lips that I kiss with press to the dirt
French-kiss vixens, distant and cursed
Burned bridges occurred from scriptin' my words
Word, so I'll chisel a verse
On these lie-filled halls that I've lived in and searched
I'm still lost in a head of catacombs
Cause I build walls like I'm Edgar Allan Poe
I've killed off every damsel that I know
For castles that I keep, castles that I know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Deacon the Villain]
I'm having spirits in the dark, laying under moonlight
Laughing with a stranger, like I saved her from her doomed life
Pop a couple Percs, a perk of anonymity
Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
A path that I rehearse, a cycle on repeat
Life is like a lion and I'm dying at its feet
I roll another sweet, check my muted Treo
I've seen them as the plot, too busy caught up in the B-roll
My eye up to the keyhole, scared to turn the knob
And go out on my own, instead I blend in with the mob
My memory bank's the only thing I tend to rob
And every time I phone the lob, I'm out of dodge
It's hard, on the boulevard, and other clichés
The type of bullshit that I'm feeding self these days
Corrosion on my relays, one thing my mirrors chose
An imp in new clothes, exposed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
I mow a dead lawn, aim for the alpha
Ten claws deck the halls of Valhalla
Not a man, a receptacle for crest-fallen matter
Never tempered or pressed into patterns
But just won't die, instead a palpitation from the plasma
Pumping disenchanting anecdotes and antiquated data at 'em
I get these headaches that climb down into my stomach
Then off into my extremities and out into the public
In a flood of shadow puppetry, something in the air
Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self-aware
It's recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
Close encounters exacerbate his condition
From classy to a bastion of classic misdirection
Tune into the Casio adventures
When the rest of me can barely form a god-damn sentence

[Hook][Verse]
How far does this rabbit hole go?
Alice in a Blunderland, flammable so
Animals roam and the catacomb slows
Searching for capital, searching for hope
Churning the sad into tangible goals
They’re burning their flags to adapt to the cold
Ration control, happiness sold
Eye-for-eye habits, a cannibal cult
They feed me cyanide tablets
They breathe low at the sight of my panic
Heavy-hearted, mind if I stab it?
Depths of my sanity, height of my madness
I’m on prescriptions, Iodine tablets
I don't trust the water, so why would I have it?
Jim Jones with the Kool-Aid, sip slow
Two faces, one slit throat
Animals pile and the ocean’s a medicine
Alcohol files, the Coke and the Mescaline
Antidote style, smoke for adrenaline
And I don't smile, it exposes my skeleton
I got the soul of an elephant
Grieving the lost on a road that’s so desolate
Echoes are still resonant, the ghost of the Oedipus
And Dear God letters that I wrote for the Hell of it
You see the tendencies
For them, it’s to tend and cease, but not me
See, I can attend and get ten degrees
Attention-piqued, to ten ‘til the tenure’s reached, but not me
Increase intensity
I’ll walk 'til the tendons cease, Achilles
I can walk to attend Dead Seas, and drown myself in it
Narcissus did it, give it any minute
I'll admit that I am just an artist that's a part of this equation, huh?
Nah, I’m a part of this aphasia
I fucked myself, so I’m auto-nymphomania
I gotta make-up words, it’s getting harder to explain it but
The particles in my brain erupt
The pace is up, when I’m vulnerable and caught up in the mania
I’m in the cut off that Indica, inner-cuts
Never seem to cease and so I zip it shut
I’m on a 50, a milli, a milli grams
Enough so I’m not a killi, a killing them
I feel a million, I'm the villain I'm
Antagonistic, vicious obsidian
But so purple inspired
Circlin' tired in a circus attire
Bumbling bubble bee, worker for hire
Build prisons to live in, and churches for liars
Perfect environments to purchase desire
Selling their souls for which version is higher
Parents used to listen to that Earth, Wind and Fire
But I like Cohen, bird on a wire
Moral compass is like, "Fuck it, I don’t need it"
If it bleeds, then it can die, and if it dies then I can eat it
That includes minor demons, platitudes and my secrets that I keep
Atlas with the clavicle, so creep
With me as I crawl through the hood, maniac
Lunatic, or just unimpressed, yeah I've felt a hundred deaths
Facing all the greatest odds, but I’m in the hunt again
Pacing ‘til it makes me lost, swell until I’m puffer fish
Razor in an aching jaw, red all in my upper-lip
Take it with a grain of salt, set it in the cut you left
Painting on the caveman walls, sentences my lover said
I'll chase you down the rabbit hole until I lose my breath[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
For every hole I've punched in the wall
Every piece of paper crumbled as we've suffer in the bloodiest fall
For every pulsating ego blistered into moon ripe nosebleeds
I nurse these festering wounds and drop no rose seeds
But grow an orchid garden
Now the pains on your portrait hardens with a face that resorts to jargon
Scribbled like a suicide note
Like I'll stop
I show the beauty by a profile shot
Freeze, don't fret for the truth
Cause I'll pray till I heard footsteps on the roof
I swear to god I don't believe in angels
Ask me, atheist, Ashley
Where's the wings in this relationship?
Passions has passed me, cast another spell
Mortified, melancholy, Madness to Michelle
Suicide Sarah, alliterate your fate, worship the absence and demonstrate my faith
(Glance in the mirror on my bathroom door
I saw her dance in rain in the summer downpour)
I saw her dance till the rain put the fire out
Burned at the stake, Joan of Arc, little anxious saint
I illustrate the gates of hell into my notebook her flesh burns up in the furnace
Ashes to Ashley
Earth to something earnest
I slit my wrist in cursive with an ink pen
Write a revelation, burn a stack of bibles
Question my faith, get my churlish ass to smile
Find another subtle piece of confidence to muster
Her ministry echoes in this monolithic structure
Cremate the dying Christmas trees
The winter is full of bitter, ashy, black blizzards
So when the superstition delivered
And it came down the chimney, they found her in the fireplace with me
Ashes to Ashley

[Bridge]
The fire's only half dead, how many angels can you fit on a matchhead?
Count them
Try start a fire
Do it
Turn the volume down or write a song to her movement (x4)

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
We walked a broken path while the sun was bleak
And we were holding hands on these rusted swings
That I called "us" and my love would sink
Underseas that we would drown underneath
When you would swim deep to catch my lip's speech
To try to catch drifts to catch what it means
And you found what would grow between us
So I thought about you while I wrote The Phoenix
And now my spine shivers from the notes that you speak
Of perfect pitched melodies and emotions you seek
That I'm composing in dreams, so you can see that I love you
And I'll hold your broken dreams till I'm bleeding in puddles
She breaks bones, engraves poems in gravestones (Text!)
Paints quotes of pathos as pain grows (Next!)
Rain flows became hopes of rainbows (When!)
Angels with halos and saints spoke (Blessed!)
Death to this world now we've given enough
I wanna hide you from the company that misery loves
And so I draw blood with few strokes and our love it drew close
So you can draw attention with the pen that you hold
Reveal your energy; and we'll just get to keep
The radio-active I can feel your chemistry
When we gaze at sea waves and freebase off replays
That re-late to cliches to see fate will be grace
I find peace in our dance on ice sheets
To bathe your silhouette in the tears the skies weep
We'll burn bridges to find warmth from life's storms
And cross roads at the point where lives meet
I'll show you memories I hate to reveal
If you could feel what I say Then I could say what I feel
And I finally learned what it takes to confess
I'll take you to a place filled with grace and sunsets[Hook]

[Hook]I write in long hand a short-term memory
Hopeless romantic, coarse word tendencies
Right now I don't want to wake up
Or try to forget when the storm first entered me
Lately I've felt self destructive
Self-inflicted, self help the cuts with
Shell shocked, Hell's bells and trumpets
Self-taught to tell tales in public
Of this life, same shit but different day
I write it down, same shit in different ways
Fight it now, break fists against the cage
Until I climb on that slave ship and drift away
My blood boils (in cups) the sun spoils (abrupt)
And unloyal (with love) so come toil (with us)
The sun freezes (and cuts) in some seasons (and plus)
Its untreated (so trust) I'm done bleeding
In a place where I can be and touch all of the things I see
To find my peace and I can breathe with nobody looking back at me
I'll just take a breath and place my bets but never deal
'Til I face my death with a game of chess like Seventh Seal
I'll still fight the step-dads and memories
Scream Zion 'til deaf dance to melodies
Deadpanned with setbacks and jealousy
Until hea-ven ex-pands the hell in me
Acquired conscious competence of all of my accomplishments
And conquered constant comments that contradicted my confidence
Common compliments were called upon to con me in
Accosted consonant comments that condescended all my common sense
Where I'm from, no one stays alive
You just die by the sword, a shogun's frame of mind
Walk with the rest like its Dawn of the Dead
And drink from the blood that the open veins provide
My raps are like a novel with clever style and prose
Im Edgar Allan Poe, the Casque of Amontillado
Enter catacombs 'til clever palindromes
And letters that I wrote can capture the god Apollo

Hear the secret stammers time'll tell
I rebel, they teach me manners with a Bible-belt
Schtick, psychedelic, dreams of banter
Scenes of candor I embellish
Like a zombie that eats through tissue
Until I find a heart with a beat to spit to
If its not in the meat I sift through
I'll write it acapella on the piece I bit through
I'm savage, and its near the dead of night
Wait 'til the sun paints an iridescent sky
To head the deadened cries
Of an old boy given no choice but to fear the present time

Take the reigns, I'm sick and tired of the practice
Of burnin' bridges, I lit the fire with a matchstick
Return the image to where I'm at, cus thinking back
I've been sinking fast, and tripping wires where the sands quick
Across plains with bloody palms and jaw pains
Hiding from God's grace in fright like its Pompeii
And always, I'll just stay on the lost road
While you study crucifixes painted with barcodes
And this time, I'll just try my luck
Surrounded by these masks like it's eyes wired shut
And I might jump ship or I flip like it's my live bus
So I try trust with how it was or how it is when
Frowns insist sounds of love amount to this
Too proud to kiss so I sewed my lips shut
So love drowned within the open wrist cuts
At first its just a ride to live fast
Until I felt the bruises inside from whiplash
A purpose, I'll try to get that
Until I fall from grace and I die on impact
And intact was a single broken locket
With the ocean on its rustic chain and face that no one wanted
I'm growing nauseous from a world that never stops
When my center's lost hope in the ghost that haunted Pentecost
I stand in graveyards and dance to take charge
Of concepts of death that I have to base on
Even when my bones crack I'll pace on
Through the epitaphs that my pasts engraved on
Laugh and stay strong, embrace the day
'Till it fades away with this mask I paint on

She's probably just a bitch that's casting all the shadows
Laughing at my battles and following a trend
Searching for an angel at the bottom of a fifth
But my hands stay empty, I swallow it again
Its the loss of leaves that autumn brings
That show me these limbs are far from wings
I'm far from happy, you're far from peace
I'll fall from grace and you'll fall for me
And awkwardly I'll just change my posture
'Till the aches and pains rearrange the monsters[Hook: Ceschi]
This winter lasted far too long
All that we loved sunk into fog
If one day without rain could come
To just make way for warmth of sun

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
What if every drop of rain's a letter from the sky
And they each concealed a message if you read it you could fly
Who would send it would you bet that it was God?
Cause it doesn't really matter if it's met with an applause
It's a testament of flaws I'll sit and face the skies now
Empathize with rain to anticipate the ride down
To find out how they dance between the paper stars
To embrace the dark before they inundate the night's clouds
Now that's an optimistic view
I can script a musical while options are reviewed
Pieces of me tend to die but I can miss the funeral
I fall into the view that my life is simply beautiful

[Hook: Ceschi]
This winter lasted far too long
All that we loved sunk into fog
If one day without rain could come
To just make way for warmth of sun

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
I try to find a pattern in the fallen leaves I walk in
But I can't find if I'm inside an autumn breeze or coffin
All I see is dark when you own both these irises
I attempt to bite my lips but all my teeth are sharpened
It's like I like to like to fight the sight that I've become
Like I like to like to find the night inside the sun
Like I tried to write the side of life that I've abided by
And by and by I strive to find a sign that I'm in love
Love is what you find when you're circling the sky
While you're burning all the white feathers learning how to fly
Searching for a sign or a version of goodbye
That could perfectly describe what was pertinent inside
I'm not certain but if I'm a brushstroke on the canvas
I'm scratching all my love notes on a matchstick
And when it catches the smoke becomes letters
And it floats on forever 'til the sun grows romantic

[Hook: Ceschi]
This winter lasted far too long
All that we loved sunk into fog
If one day without rain could come
To just make way for warmth of sun

If you are what you eat then I will eat my heart out
And wear it on my sleeve so it matches my apparel
Up the other is a sample from the tarot
So I can cheat destiny and gamble with the arrows
That they sling when I quiver in their wake up in a blizzard when I shiver and I shake
Love like a sinner when it's grimmer and I play
Tough to be delivered from this winter
Another night of wondering if it's the age of innocence
I'll plead the fifth right before I take a sip from it
I'll cease desist and try to break the dissonance
From the demon's lips just so I can make a difference
In this day without the rain
The sky is sapphire leaving traces of the stains on my skin
I'll never say it was in vain
I'll just hold my breath and pray that I can savor it again

[Hook: Ceschi]
This winter lasted far too long
All that we loved sunk into fog
If one day without rain could come
To just make way for warmth of sunTry to find a place in lines that I embrace
While I strive to find a balance between a time and space
In a microphone.. When I'm soundin' intense
I feel like 'Pac on his hospital bed, countin' his breaths
And they still say, Ill never blow on the mic
Unless I spit a gimmick with some clever jokes cus I'm white
Im forced to listen to critics just chatter they teeth
With all their bullshit opinions like it matters to me
And my closest friends stumble as they mumble and doubt me
While I try to hold the world as it crumbles around me
Feel my lungs close, strain harder for breaths
As the broken dreams I have match the heart in my chest
And the pressure builds But without a release
I know that ya hope floats, but its out of my reach
I'm tired of the masks that we wear (if only)
You saw my true self you'd be scared (to know me)
But now I finally see what I love is worthless
Beauty's skin deep, but its just a surface
My shoulders are breaking and my focus is hazy
Plus my teeth are chipped from biting all the bullets that you gave me
In the form of lies, and I mistook it as honest
Took the good with the losses, til the good was just lost, its
Hard to hold the burdens until my shoulders bleed
I was forced to flee, until I learned to fly with broken wings
Across the visions of feelin's and all this violent livin'
Of a fucked up system insistin' that I should try to fit in
But now I can see I'm unrelated to you
Cus I took off the mask that suffocated the truth
(If Life) could even worsen, (Then Id) release my burden
(And try) to be the person, (Who writes) and speaks in perfect
(Advice) for people hurtin', (Who cries) and fiends for nursing
(And time) would be asserted, (To find) a decent purpose
(But I) am weak and burdened, (I cry) and seek alertness
(In life) to be the person, (Who's lines) are seen as perfect
(I try) and seem so nervous, (That life) has demons lurkin'
(That I) defeat the purpose, (And Life) is seen as worthless

Watch everyday just pass me by
Slowly corroding and acting fine
Suffocating on this mask of mine
Til I run out of breath and I can't survive
Repeat x2

Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth
Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth
Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth
Through my angel eyes I see
(Repeat x 4)

I need to get a piece of inhibition (First!)
And speak another piece of bitter vision (Words!)
And get a better syndicate of vindicated few
And I better never let another mitigate the truth
Cus I'm the better, never get a flow with flaw
Better with the letters, veteran know it all
Talk a lot in a song, better hold em off
I thought I was lost, never fold or fall
If I could ever get a minute trying to be
My life independent when I'm dying in peace
I might get a sentiment I write to a beat
My mind of a veteran, trying to see
That life's beautiful, suitable to let go
Of anything and Ill just survive through it all
Inner lines intertwined, my mind is livin' life
Grippin' mics, livin' life in trife its live and die[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
For every hole I've punched in the wall
Every piece of paper crumbled as we've suffer in the bloodiest fall
For every pulsating ego blistered into moon ripe nosebleeds
I nurse these festering wounds and drop no rose seeds
But grow an orchid garden
Now the pains on your portrait hardens with a face that resorts to jargon
Scribbled like a suicide note
Like I'll stop
I show the beauty by a profile shot
Freeze, don't fret for the truth
Cause I'll pray till I heard footsteps on the roof
I swear to god I don't believe in angels
Ask me, atheist, Ashley
Where's the wings in this relationship?
Passions has passed me, cast another spell
Mortified, melancholy, Madness to Michelle
Suicide Sarah, alliterate your fate, worship the absence and demonstrate my faith
(Glance in the mirror on my bathroom door
I saw her dance in rain in the summer downpour)
I saw her dance till the rain put the fire out
Burned at the stake, Joan of Arc, little anxious saint
I illustrate the gates of hell into my notebook her flesh burns up in the furnace
Ashes to Ashley
Earth to something earnest
I slit my wrist in cursive with an ink pen
Write a revelation, burn a stack of bibles
Question my faith, get my churlish ass to smile
Find another subtle piece of confidence to muster
Her ministry echoes in this monolithic structure
Cremate the dying Christmas trees
The winter is full of bitter, ashy, black blizzards
So when the superstition delivered
And it came down the chimney, they found her in the fireplace with me
Ashes to Ashley

[Bridge]
The fire's only half dead, how many angels can you fit on a matchhead?
Count them
Try start a fire
Do it
Turn the volume down or write a song to her movement (x4)

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
We walked a broken path while the sun was bleak
And we were holding hands on these rusted swings
That I called "us" and my love would sink
Underseas that we would drown underneath
When you would swim deep to catch my lip's speech
To try to catch drifts to catch what it means
And you found what would grow between us
So I thought about you while I wrote The Phoenix
And now my spine shivers from the notes that you speak
Of perfect pitched melodies and emotions you seek
That I'm composing in dreams, so you can see that I love you
And I'll hold your broken dreams till I'm bleeding in puddles
She breaks bones, engraves poems in gravestones (Text!)
Paints quotes of pathos as pain grows (Next!)
Rain flows became hopes of rainbows (When!)
Angels with halos and saints spoke (Blessed!)
Death to this world now we've given enough
I wanna hide you from the company that misery loves
And so I draw blood with few strokes and our love it drew close
So you can draw attention with the pen that you hold
Reveal your energy; and we'll just get to keep
The radio-active I can feel your chemistry
When we gaze at sea waves and freebase off replays
That re-late to cliches to see fate will be grace
I find peace in our dance on ice sheets
To bathe your silhouette in the tears the skies weep
We'll burn bridges to find warmth from life's storms
And cross roads at the point where lives meet
I'll show you memories I hate to reveal
If you could feel what I say Then I could say what I feel
And I finally learned what it takes to confess
I'll take you to a place filled with grace and sunsets[Verse 1: KoLyric]
Time and space was frozen, at home but still alone and
I felt like David Bowman the way my life unfolded
In front of me was everything, including all the old vids
And in the ripping centerpiece was you and I so close
I decide to hold it with these scissor hands stapled with hammer tacker
To my wrist that’s in the pattern of a canister, after
Reconnecting with my past it detaches and that just
Was a matter of fracture. Anti matter of fact
I existed 'til the universe was in the palm of my hand
Let it live 'til I gave it up like the father in “Ran”
It’s haunted me since, blessed with an alternate twist
Upon the precipice, I was blind to the matter at hand
Am I mad or just another abandoned romance
Lack of a motive to open up to another person again
It’s over, the end, hunching over the ledge
That cracks at the edge from the solar eclipse I look til my vision came back
Another story from Celine and Jesse, this time there’s an ending
And this time the metamorphosis is forced into the best scene
There was nothing I could do to fight the creature next to me
Defeated me with its tainted teeth in my heart to let it beat
Forever enemies, lost love was the death of the century
“Don’t let her leave” resonates within my memory
The others won’t fight for it though like I have before
Love smothers you like a pillow from that scene in Amour
Walking through the quick sand
On stilts i built with slit hands
The guilt it kills but it can
Rebuild what broke on impact
Hung myself with ropes I knew
Dangled by the noose she made
The halo dies when angels crumble still the humble truth decays
Dragged me up this alley blind with hopes to tear me up inside
Knowing my hearts on my wrist she had my arms wrapped up in vines
The pretty swan denies the lonely duckling for nothing
The numbing’s summoned from the broken coven of ugly (it’s just me)

[Hook: Notebook.]
Who would had known I could sell my soul to myself?
Instead of looking around and searching within the glow for the devil
It's kind of funny when you think about it...
Knowing there's really no way around it for sure
Who would had known I could sell my soul to myself?
Instead of looking around and searching within the glow for the devil
It's kind of funny when you think about it...
Knowing there's really no way around it for sure

Knowing there's really no way around it for sure
We sit and contemplate stepping out of the door
Into infinity, into another nightmare
It's better facing demons cause these fools don't come to fight fair



[Verse 2: Sadistik]
Black swan black swan, tell me is the past gone?
I think we'll save it if we can make it to passed dawn
I got a glass jaw without a leg to stand on
MC Escher with the letters look at what my hand's drawn
It's for you, I kinda think it fits you well
Flirting with disaster but I promise I don't kiss and tell
I've been living well, foot in front of one another
At the wishing well so I can look above and run for cover
Have we lost our chance to make it?
Cause I think I'd live forever just to watch your transformation
A beautiful butterfly who chooses to run and hide
With swan song music as a suitable subject line for this
We sort of stray into the fog
In the calm before the storm I'll storm away and lose my calm
You can crucify me just to try to ruin my palms
I'll finger paint this room until I'm gone with the Black Swan

[Hook: Notebook.]
Who would had known that I could sell my soul to myself?
Instead of looking around and searching within the glow for the devil
It's kind of funny when you think about it...
Knowing there's no way around it for sure
Who would had known I could sell my soul to myself?
Instead of looking around and searching within the glow for the devil
It's kind of funny when you think about it...
Knowing there's really no way around it for sure

Knowing there's really no way around it for sure
We sit and contemplate stepping out of the door
Into infinity, into another nightmare
It's better facing demons cause these fools don't come to fight fair


[Verse 3: Notebook.]
[?][Intro]
A: Listen man, not to be rude or anything but uh...What are you? I mean your costume
B: I'm a body bag. I thought the invitation said come as you are

[Verse 1]
My style is gory like an Edgar Allan story
Monkey’s paw, allegory, fucking raw, category
Edward Gorey, sorted sorta morbid, chloroform for ‘em
Fuck their foreign forums, I’ll deform 'em with some four-inch forceps
There's no distortions, take misfortunes and record 'em
A borderline personality, plus poor decorum
Pour the poor me, more aurora borealis
I'm forming calluses from holding grudges more than normal
Got a smorgasbord, supportive followers and won't ignore 'em
Portland, Oregon, all the way to Portland, Maine, for the boredom
I’m going Foreman forming coarsest choruses
Agoraphobic portions, lived behind my ribs, absorbed and dormant
Fortified a fortress I have lived in since the storm arrived
Left ‘em mortified from horror I’ve reported, boarded up
The windows and their doors are shut to keep out the vandals
A four-cornered room and I'm staring at candles

[Hook]
A reflection I don't recognize, set with deader eyes
Looking petrified, breath is like a pesticide
Skeleton and extra-sized flesh of mine to gelatin
Resembling the dead alive, I identify with my enemies
I don't like me either, I can empathize
Never mind the effort I have severed to my lesser side
Weathered all the weather, let the temper rise

[Verse 2]
Even in the misery, I don’t want the company
I'm cuddling with ghosts that I know will accompany
Me to the grave, I made with a spade
Take me away, shutter-speed suddenly
Utterly infatuated with the patterns splattered on my atoms
Past or present lacks a presence when you just don’t give a, fuck you
Martyr or a carnivore, art of war, Sun-Tzu, Sun-Tzu
Someone come undo these hum-drum views I sing and hum drums to
My tongue gon’ spew some blood unto these dumbfucks who gon’ run amok
So run those jewels, I’m numb and dumb to the gumshoe ones who
Wonder what I been up to, what’s the matter, is that body bag too baggy, boy?

[Bridge]
So minimalissimo
At least three Gs of the Indica leaf to blow
In the pit of my seedy skull
Untreatable when the sinister creature roams
To each his own, since when do you eat your own?
They called me precious, and said I'm a piece of gold
I said they're fools, they don't listen to reason though
This blue sunshine hidden between my bones

[Hook][Intro]
Oh yeah, it's time they come down...down

[Hook]
Butterfly in the sky, I can fly twice as high

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
He said, "Fuck sobriety, death to the worker bees"
Thirteen circles I've stepped for eternity
Burning purple, stressed on a murder spree
It's self-inflicted, don't get it twisted
These knives in my back now, Elliott Smith(yeah)
Rides in the background, melodies fit (yeah)
Mixed with the misfits, fix is the hurt
When the lips that I kiss with press to the dirt
French-kiss vixens, distant and cursed
Burned bridges occurred from scriptin' my words
Word, so I'll chisel a verse
On these lie-filled halls that I've lived in and searched
I'm still lost in a head of catacombs
Cause I build walls like I'm Edgar Allan Poe
I've killed off every damsel that I know
For castles that I keep, castles that I know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Deacon the Villain]
I'm having spirits in the dark, laying under moonlight
Laughing with a stranger, like I saved her from her doomed life
Pop a couple Percs, a perk of anonymity
Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
A path that I rehearse, a cycle on repeat
Life is like a lion and I'm dying at its feet
I roll another sweet, check my muted Treo
I've seen them as the plot, too busy caught up in the B-roll
My eye up to the keyhole, scared to turn the knob
And go out on my own, instead I blend in with the mob
My memory bank's the only thing I tend to rob
And every time I phone the lob, I'm out of dodge
It's hard, on the boulevard, and other clichés
The type of bullshit that I'm feeding self these days
Corrosion on my relays, one thing my mirrors chose
An imp in new clothes, exposed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
I mow a dead lawn, aim for the alpha
Ten claws deck the halls of Valhalla
Not a man, a receptacle for crest-fallen matter
Never tempered or pressed into patterns
But just won't die, instead a palpitation from the plasma
Pumping disenchanting anecdotes and antiquated data at 'em
I get these headaches that climb down into my stomach
Then off into my extremities and out into the public
In a flood of shadow puppetry, something in the air
Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self-aware
It's recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
Close encounters exacerbate his condition
From classy to a bastion of classic misdirection
Tune into the Casio adventures
When the rest of me can barely form a god-damn sentence

[Hook][Verse 1: Sadistik]
Veins like a roadmap, black cold grasp on a throat that
Won’t hold back old habit, Kodak moments go past
I wrote stains on a toe-tag, old man made me so sad
That no taste of the Cognac or Prozac antidote, twist my skull
Off with his head, head like a hole Nine Inch Nails pressed to the bone
Exit alone, try and fail, I’ve inhaled dead to the world
Ethanol on your pedestal, churn chemical burns
Hurt worse than skeletal, so skeptical at first, perfect
Cursive in Hell, sweet silver bells all seem to say "Please go away”
Demons will play, eating away, new young and old, food for the soul-
Less that you know, the less that you feel
I'm cursed with intelligence I can't heal
Kneel, kill, death to the bourgeois, proletariat with the new song
Noose on a bony neck, loneliness, opiate and a bruised jaw
Allah’s not, nobody owns me, no job, robot, no cold feet
No God, only strong no home, no soul sold so-so so long

[Hook: Lotte Kestner]
Watch the paint peel
Slow as the burn you feel
Break the heart you never should've
You can bury anything
In the woods

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
I'm a live wire in a dead world, I'm a good boy, but I'm a better girl
Eyes closed, finger on the trigger, one inch different I'm free
You’re a widow, liquor liver, Suboxone under my tongue
Private numb, one more time for dying young
I had fun, watching father try to run, but he left a black hole inside his son
If we're being Frank, I'm an average Joe, cop shop
Jake and Johnny, Jack and Coke, your tsunami of only
Honestly couldn't even reach the back row
So how do you expect to drown me, dumbfound me or harm me
You and what army, are we clear, I'm here
In a rearview mirror, coming to a theater near you
To steer you away from your fears, stage bound
Usually it's break-a-leg, she told me to break a heart
I didn't know what to say exactly so I walked away
And later thought I should've at least told her thanks
But that's how that goes, where the grass grows
There’s a past in the time capsule, I'm attracted to its shadow
Every last drip 'til I'm flat broke
Let’s make this storm feel clean, coward man war machine
Sour plans, plots and schemes, ripened fruit, rotten dreams
Thoughtlessly, I told a lie, nothing I won't do to save my own behind
I'm a live wire burning dead inside
But I'm not dead, I'm not dead, I'm not dead until I've died

[Outro: Eyedea]
Yeah, cut your wrists on a blade of glass
I can't change my past but I can kiss the now and make it last
Take out the trash, crash, burn, another relapse
Turn rehashed meat perhaps
There's an in-between smile and frown behind your maskThey say the dead never speak, maybe I don't listen
To the sweet nothings in the crazy world I live in
I'm in a flush grey Seattle on Monday as the sun rays chase the shadows up hills
With a child-like sentiment, catch me if you can it's a fight flight rhetoric
Dancing on command till the night's light's setting in
Fancy what you have, it's the zeitgeist yet again
In hindsight to find my cause of death I chased my dreams then I lost my breath - get it?
Am I clever with the words? Does it really really matter when you're entering a hearse?
Look, I'm alone in a coma from the methadone searching for a saint that was frozen in a bed of snow
And then I'll excavate the set of bones, easy come, easy go, better late than never though
Here we go again, we can call it my defeat when my tongue is in my cheek for a solid ninety weeks
Swallow pride and grief, that is all I really had, just so I can understand that is all that I can be
And from a birdseye view, sixteen shots and I'll earn my dues
Sixteen shots and the world I knew is a resting plot for the kerbside blues
I see a city trapped in amber full of all the joy and the misery that's captured
Bright lights emitting in a pattern by the fireflies like a symphony of lanternsThey fake but look real
They fake, they fake, they fake but look real
They fake, they fake, they fake but look real
They fake, they fake, they fake but look real
They fake, they fake, they fake but look real
Cubic zirconia, cubic zirconia, cubic zircon-
They fake but look real
Cubic zirconia, cubic zirconia, cubic zircon-

[Verse 1]
It's not a diamond if you have to flaunt it
Multifaceted, lacks a polish
Puzzled looks, I don’t have to solve them
Future's bright, my past is onyx
Yeah, sad is honest
Ignorance is bliss so, sad is honest
Have no high-notes, I lack the octaves
Turn laughs to cries those, raps to sonnets
I'm a cubic zirconia, such a cubic zirconia
Now I'm catatonic
I had a varnish but that got tarnished

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's not a diamond if it cracks on impact
It's a present to slide past the giftwrap
If it's a seven when dice land, you get craps
Future's high heaven and my past is pitch black
They put my lines and values
Under a microscope to find a value
Kaleidoscopic light astounds you
But won't change the pricetag I amount to
I'm a cubic zirconia, cubic zircone

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My father told me I would grow into a diamond
But since I've lost him, I don't know how to find it
I feel so unpolished, make me blindin'
In a lackluster world where nothing’s shinin'
I’ll rearrange these 26 while demons play a lovely bit
To eat away my ugly ‘til I see the day I love it, this
Is my certificate, my appraisal
If you never drop a gem, I’ll never never praise you
And so I’m thankful there’s nobody I’m chained to
Predators don't prey when there's nobody to pray to
Yeah, and then nobody can change you
Cubic zirconia, nobody can save you

[Hook]Owner of a lonely heart, I’m Minnesota in the coldest part
But this is Washington, the coast of sharks
No this is Waterloo, I’m Bonaparte
Napoleon Complex has pulled my bones apart
[I’m no Joan of Arc]
I’m lost at sea, oh so Noah’s Ark
Until they fall for me like Owen Hart
I hope that’s not in Bad Taste, like Peter Jackson’s horror start
Or over all their heads like the lower stars, or overwrought
That means it’s overwrote, so you could overlook it
It’s Overlook Hotel when they go into the bushes
The snow is full of footprints that I made
I’ll be your voodoo doll today, just poke into the cushion
I feel the Evil Dead, coming from my feeble head
Unraveling my sanity by a needle thread
I see the trends, the secrets that are being kept
Like anchors that I tie around my throat, I know it’s sink-or-swim
So follow me, I’ll be your cult leader
Cody Koresh and the Throat Bleeders
I fell in love with the Helter Skelter on the walls
That they’d crawl up when I’d Helen Keller to their calls
The Demerol that they pump through their veins
Gets embalmed when they run through the flames
The sun and the rain
Either way, it’s just the same when your eyes are closed like mine
The world can be at peace, but inside it’s so unlike…Ultraviolet[Verse 1: MC Type]

I feel another one of those, I can't let it go
Coming on on my chest to explode
I'm stressed, it shows
It's best that you just leave me to fester in my mess alone (Yes I'm gone)
Off the deep end, I can't pretend
It is the weekend knowing it's the work week
As I begin to regress and seep in
My regrets I wallow in the shit that'll hurt me
Am I worthy of serotonin uptake
Or a fragile figurine that must break
I fell from the shelf and yelled 'fuck fate'
Shattered shards of glass from a past I once faced
This is how blood tastes
Wen the teeth of the untamed are unleashed upon me
I want pain--I wanna feel something that isn't neutral
And only my scars can be the living proof of

[Hook: MC Type]

I feel so stressed, I feel alone
Like there's no place to call home
I can't stop these thoughts, am I damaged?
I don't know what's wrong

I don't have to feel these feelings I can let them go

[Verse 2: Sadistik]

It goes knock-knock, who's there, yeah it's just the gloom again
50 milligrams of sertraline, that should do the trick
I got a new prescrip', mix it in with booze I binge
Choose a friend to sip it with and sit until my mood ascends
I grew up since I was born on April twentieth
In 1986 with a decorum for the ugli-necessary
I'm still mourning for the summer's bliss
I felt inside, it's been replaced with the selfish pride
I carry, like a tortured little writer
Is it a masterpiece or the portrait of a liar?
On my hands and knees when I'm scorching in the fire
Just so I could plant the seeds of the orchids of desire
Just a monster in the closet, perfect posture
When I spot him searching all through my apartment for my conscience
When all the dust is settled and there's only rusted metal
I can look at all the wreckage to accept it's nothing special
Cause I'm damaged

[Hook: MC Type]There's fireants in the bloodstream, wolves in the dining room
Firedance to drum beats I fold at the sight of moons
Moonshine I consume consummates the tomb
Stoned in my room confiding interviews in a muse like [muah]
Purple Urkle herbals venting circles, circumventing hurdles
Hurt'll go away eventually just let it bleed
That's what she says to me, my Everything
And then she dissipates into the seven rings
She said every single one would represent a different sin of mine
In cinematic synergy, a liturgy of bitter highs
Similar to when I find something that I think I love
Just to watch it shrink to dust, or say it hates or isn't mine
Yea, I'm a product of a different time
Walking on a different line
Auction off my God and throw it in a fire
Joan of Arc empathizer, strict attire, all black, victimizer
Sick and tired, don't they frickin' see I fricassee?
Injecting venom when I'm injuring to kill, I'm still a different breed
Ministries are fitting, timpanis are hitting, symphonies are lifting gingerly
You can't hear it, it's in me, it's in my inner-me, inner demons entertain my enemies
The energy I've grown to know's so bittersweet
So kiss the ring around the rosy that I left around your eye for being nosey
I'm unholy, they don't lionize the lonely
With a Dandelion head, wings like an albatross
I'm camoflauge background cannon-fodd
I don't speak with the chatterbox-es
But I can drink 'til I'm cataton-ic-uor-ice stained teeth and lips
Fingers fish like a hook for my weaknesses
Grievances I mistook for sleeplessness
And focusing, sew it seams like seamstresses
Yea, so add it to my catalog
I'm picture perfect, Richard Avedon
Standin' on the thin ice I dance upon
Tap tap, black hat, black cat for bad luck I gamble on
Long-shots I take, Jamal Crawford, cross-over-all awkward
I'm a tag-along, following the fallers and the vagabonds
Yea, that's my grave that you're standing on
I hear the ears against the plaster wallsThis is magic, its tragic, its passion, its me
This is classic romance and its madness, its peace
This is masochists, Catholics, addicts and activists
Blackness and sadness that pacifists see
This is close to me, focusing, ghosts that sing (Axioms!)
Rosary, broken wings holding me (Back-a-wards!)
Followed the path to to to find find find this
And I swallowed the wrath to un-ite my intents-tents-tents
Tensions will build, walls will collapse
Lessons instilled when I saw through the cracks
Cracked smiles repaired, we just crawl in our tracks
Cause we live just to die, we evolve to adapt
To the fast food and the tattoos
Its like I just can't see past the bad news
And I can't bruise, like a statue
But I'm fallin' apart from the shrap-nel
This is casualties, atrophy, mastering (axioms!)
Gravity, gradually, askin' me (back-a-wards!)
Progress make can you when reverse in be why?
Feel I how just that's cus reverse in words speak I
Any and every engaging discussion
Of lovin's engraving a memory in me
Memories in me engraving the lovin'
Of every and any engaging discussion
High high high mid mid mid low low low (Next!)
Why try my wish if this goal I holds (Dead!)
Sooner or later I'll drown in regret
When I'm swimming in circles and holding my breath[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Marijuana that I light when I’m alone
Reaching ultraviolet lights to kill the spiders in my skull
I'm a recluse, wreck you, hiding in my home
M. Bison when I light up, doing spirals when I roam
With the buffalo, puff of smoke, get stigmata
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
I'm with the vultures, get some drama
Don’t believe in karma, head shot (BLAT BLAT)
Two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Oh there’s three left in the chamber with the gun against the head
Russian roulette, one of ‘em’s left
Left wondering, "Was it something I said?"
These motherfuckers run for cover when I hum a number
Something other, muttered thunder, hunger
For the blood of others, hunting, Hunter S
Junkie huffing puffing, under stress like gutter slug
With nothing but a stuttered des-tiny
Tiny ants dance beneath this giant’s feet
Rival me and get the iron lung for irony
Ire breeds, I am me, Ayatollah fire breathes
From the mouth of madness
Michael Myers when the smiles cease, idling
They talk shit on Wi-Fi bout the best
But their fingers stick to text nine times out of ten
Yeah, watch 'em die by fountain pen
A pound of flesh, and it better not be counterfeit

[Hook: instrumental break 8 measures]
Die, die, die (x2)

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
You think you can take me? Well, come on with it
I'm a sick, twisted fuck, I leave you tormented
So if you got a weak stomach then you better forget it
I'm a shark, I smell blood, it's too late to forfeit it
Deading y’all niggas is what I do for a living
And I'ma leave a scar so you never forget it
Have you dripping out of windows, while we robbing your credit
Run it by me, you won't be able to walk to the clinic
I'm a pathologist, Dr. Kevorkian
Nigga, I promised this, the Hip Hop scorpion
I turn all y’all kids into orphans then
Raise them as my own, shit that’s better off for them
I know I'm going to the place that's too hot for me
Cause I'm a fallen angel, something in me gots to sink
Ain't no way in hell I'm not top of the ten
If I'm not number one, I must be zero then
You dead in my sights, it's over once I zero in
Dead to rights for try'na be a hero again
Time to sign your death warrant, nigga hand on a pen
Put your best foot forward, take it on the chin
Plus whenever I'm on track pain get inflicted
Punchlines hit your head, your brain gets shifted
I'm vicious, have you screaming, “Abort the mission”
Relentless, I like to see you hurt, that's sadistic

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Ahga beeba fee a lotta booby
Dada boba shabaland who be hotta? not a man!
Who ever think different's in lala land
Allah crammed scholar and a lot of K.O.D
Inside of my knot then bada bam
Strange Music, my gang ruthless we Bang you if
Lame stupidness out ya fangs true is the pain you get
From brain shoe kicks my aims lucid my name shoot this thang
Hang nooses we flame crew it's no dang blue shit!
Sick with Sticky and Sadistik suddenly something shifted
Simple Simon suckas seemin' submissive
See us and some surely substitute sis's
Chakratease spit shit psycho scripts is scripted syphilis!
You haters don't ride on my dick but yo mamma there
She like to play in my goat she call it Osama hair!
So now you wanna go get yo llama pair and shoot me
I'll die cause my insurance was fucked up by ObamaCare![Intro (Sadistik & Astronautalis)]
I﻿ am the only one they made
Cast from charming bones and clay
On that cold Winter’s day or so they say
We are the last known to exist
Hiding shine remote cliffs
We prefer it that way
Please leave us just like this

[Verse One: Astronautalis]
I used to hammer sheet metal till my palms bled
Cash my pay check at the bar then drink the whole thing
Catch a pheasant with my bare hands, take her home with me
Wake up at 5am and make it back to work to start again
You're sweating whiskey in that first shift
By lunch break you're feeling worthless
And soon you're cracking jokes with workers
By the time the final whistle blows, your body's feeling perfect
So let's celebrate the good times
Another round for the old guys
And to that pretty thing with glazed eyes
I ain't asking for a dance, I'm just hoping for a great night

[Hook: Astronautalis (Sadistik)]
Cause when the stopwatch dies we all drop like flies, so what's the point in being free to die (Right?)
(You see it's not my time, I thought I lost my mind but instead it found a place to hide)
Keep your fucking keys, I don't need to drive (nah), I'll just run for the rest of the night
(Empty handle with my tongue on the edge of a knife, make me young, make me numb, 'til my exit arrives)

[Bridge: Lotte Kestner]
My heart it pounds, so I can't make out a sound
I've come this far, and I couldn’t leave without you now
If my heart beats now, then I'll go turn around
If you know me, nobody does

[Verse Two: Sadistik]
Damaged goods tend to hide in pretty packages
Saddened looks get disguised in witty adages
It's our dramatic twist, come watch the magic tricks
Abracadabra, necromancer sawed in half again
So I mutter some witty quips
If love is to give a glimpse, what's under my skinny ribs?
A couple of whiskey sips or something to get me fixed
Before I'm antisocial like it's Buffalo 66 in here --
So is it beautiful or frail?
I feel like Ouroboros when I'm chewing on my tail
The crows can form a chorus when the funeral prevails
It shows a glowing orange when the moon is full and pale
Wide awake and rueful, looking for a light to break the stupor
Of the types of grey that dilate my pupils
I can taste the sucrose on the tip of my tongue-y tongue
From tidal waves I'm running from but isn't it funny once it's done?

[Hook][Intro: Sadistik]
(Ah, the simple life)
Yeah, this is my rifle
There are many like it, but this one is mine

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
I had a heart of gold, I wore it on my sleeve
Vampire bit my arm and then it tore in three
I melted down the pieces and sold them for a fee
And all I got was some boredom from the normalty

[Verse 1: Ceschi]
Born to bleed
Probably never get more than what's been thorn from me
Swarms of bees
Still sting to the rhythm of a Grindcore horrible scream
Morrissey
Taught me never to forget those pretty girls who make graves
But could it be a mistake to ache, I'm Joan of Arc
Burning on a stake this day and age

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
All I ever wanted was to cut open my stomach
Let the butterflies go back home, that's all I know
That's Prozac, notes pass through me
Usually, I don't show that spooky side
I hide a mile high, shine so bright I might go blind
Idle eyes, rifle sights, cycle go through my vital signs
With a title fight, never rival side and silly motherfucker with a psycho mind
I go on a high note like a Bible line, but I don't lie though
So fire those, nice rifles at my temples, watch me die slow
Watch 'em all agree I'm monster in the pm
And marijuana Tijuana caught up in Tequila
Onomatopoeia when the heart beats off-beat
I don't wanna be another xerox
Copy, watch me, re-animate a zombie
Melancholy's always on my mind, my my mind may defy
My mine own guidelines that I know, they'll probably bite soon
So when High Noon comes, I'll set down my two guns
Tick-tock, quickdraw, instant, these holes are my own flesh
Count to five, bound and tied and blindfolded
They ready, they aim and now I'm so
Dead

[Verse 3: Ceschi]
Distance makes the heart grow fonder, so I pulled mine outta my chest
Hurled off to the deepest, darkest black yonder into a hornets nest
Where they picked apart everything I loved and left the remains for the birds
Broken, aimless, but we’re famous, painted, God never could maintain his work
Complex of these poison tounges, life has tested me more than once
Took the best of me, fucked aggressively, fed me to the wolves for my gods
To a thousand tiny red pixels covering your canvas
Every single syllable I spit is a pivotal piece of me unleashed
Representing my tangled anguish

[Verse 4: Ceschi]
All I ever wanted was to cut open my stomach
And strangle my enemies with the intestines that I pull from it
And I've been a bull running, everytime I seen red the scene fled
Know that my motherfucking team was best
But please believe the week, everything the magazines the teens fed
So when I scream it from the top of my lungs I mean this plead
With the streets that leave my team dead

[Outro]
"Emotionally I have a lot of pain, and I'm stunned that six human beings would stand in front of one human being and fire 46 shots. I just don't understand that. It appeared to be a firing squad dressed in police uniforms."

(Fuck the police! Fuck the police! Nine to yo dome like, Fuck the police!
Fuck the police! Fuck the police! Nine to yo dome like, Fuck the police!)[Verse 1]
Honestly, I'm as hollow as a zombie seems
Autumn leaves have fallen, but this fall is full of somber things
I saw a dream as I wandered where a pond’s beneath
I wanna sink, but the bottom of it’s not in reach
I’m on a beach walking towards the waves, rocks in jeans
Virginia Woolf felt these pocket seams
The hallows sing like it’s Halloween
Howling, Hallow’s Eve's
Themes that the shallow breeds scream in a harmony
Authoring includes dotting I’s and crossing T's
For a biography hollow eyes don’t wanna read
I sharpen teeth on their hearts until applause is reached
I’m not a king in this kingdom full of novelty

[Hook: Yes Alexander]
Moonchild, do you dream about me?
When you want to go deeper, won’t you feel my reaper?
In your chest, as you breathe
Suffocating your soul
Why keep your dreams in me

[Verse 2]
Honestly, I'm a part of all the wrong I see
Wanna see God, I hope the opposite of God is not in me
I ponder deep thoughts and want 'em free
Monitoring a heart that beats off the beaten path of sovereignty
I gotta sing improper keys to get the proper keys
Open locks with ease, bada-bingin' them and then I’m off to sleep
All I see’s an odyssey of odder scenes
Odd, it seems so obvious this audience is not for me
Monsters seem to offer me some awful dreams
I’m Harmony Korine meets a darker being it seems
I walk discreet to not be seen by gossip queens
When this author needs to polish off a vodka shot or three
Noddin' off and weak, marijuana leaves, ganja trees
Pot or weed, anything you wanna call it’s peace
Just as long as this solace keeps
I’m not complete ‘til the songs I sing resolve the grief
It’s a cacophony, properly, problem need to pop a b-
Lood vessel, stressful when I cop a plea
Apostrophe, claims ownership of property
Probably I’ll never know, cause it’s not my thing
I gotta leave

[Hook]

[Outro]
Life is beautiful
Really, it is
Full of beauty and illusions
Life is great
Without it, you’d be dead[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Cracked ribs from the hugs that you gave me
A sad grin from the love that you’d take
The mask fits so snug and so safely
When I can't live with the sum of mistakes
Somehow, you turn silence to symphonies
Violence to riveting and moments to years
Or so it appears, when the lights of the city gleam
I can do anything
Noah’s Ark, save me from open-heart mania
Going dark slowly like Joan of Arcadia
Maybe the blowing star’s home is my savior
That I sing to through my pulled apart trachea
Fist-fight just to feel the touch
Alcohol doesn't heal the cuts
Needle for the heroin, feel the rush
There's no hero for this heroine
Just... Us
