[Instrumental vocal loop: Tech N9ne]
Some gangstas wanna head blast, cause I run with the red rags

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Free Uno Ace Capone. The homie Keith Fudge, I got your back homie
LETS GO!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm bool as a bubumber
Laces in my shoes makin you wonder
Am I gonna act a fool or bring your crew thunder
Thinkin I pack the tool, the one I use on her
I ain't trippin but the old days got my mind glitchin
Like different signs that ain't my kind got they 9's whistlin
Like a nigga wanna find this and strip clips till my wines drippin
But nobody wanna do no crime they just talkin about rhyme spittin
When I'm at the movies, careful how you steppin to me
Cause I think who's starin at me wanna do me
Cause Im flamed up and soo woo-ey
Head crash, my head's bad
Cause I be thinking some gangstas wanna head blast
Cause I run with the red rags

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a motherfucking animal, red devil, Tasmanian
Bangins' in my cranium, Deuce Cique and five claimin it
Kansas City thang, from two clips at my range is bandana dangerous
You's crip when I'm sayin' it?
It's Soo-Woo business, then yous through nigga
Blood? I don't give a fuck if I knew you nigga
That's that 85 mentality, victim of your reality
Catchin, pumpin' that 7-11 in your fatalities
It's another nigga's wake-up, smoke water and drank up
Heavenly, blocks flames from 20's to the seventies
It's ballers tuckin' fed cash, to get you dead fast
Gangstas they head blast cause I run with the red flags!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Uh, I'm just bicken back and bein' bool
You don't this feelin, look you fuckin with the realest
No, gloves no, mask look you know we bout to kill it
Disrespect us will get your mami pinned to the ceilin
This is still holdin hemi's even when I'm in my jammies
Niggas wanna catch me slippin leave me sleepin like a mami
Plus they still sendin threats, haters wanna pack me out
Bunch of internet hustlas always wanna run they mouth
I ain't trippin still thuggin for blood and getting guap
And you know I keep a oo-op let it sing just like a doo-wop
And it's always tough guys, they don't never wanna co-op


[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Scoob]
Signed up, suited and booted, old nigga, ready for war
Layin back, stackin cake, but it don't take much to activate
Snatch it back and act innate, rainin' down the hand of god
Chopper get to sanging nigga smokin' like it’s El DeBarge
Forgive me Lord I'm trynna keep it cool
But I'm a old nigga with a quick fuse, quick to smell the bitch in dudes
Hard to walk in Scooby's shoes, do the shit that Scooby do
Fi' block, a general, I done paid my fuckin dues
Nigga this the life I chose, fuck that, life I choose
Still livin gang rules check the laces in these shoes
Gangsta nigga through and through, tried tested been approved
On blood, one love, nigga what, soo-woo

[Hook] x2[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
If my kid has a problem
Its up to me as the guardian to go and solve em'
Make my life and involve em
Late at night when I call em
I like to hear em' say daddy your song is awesome
Instead of gangbangers in school won't let up
I'm fed up I'm wondering if you can come up an red up
You shut up, negativity can be found inside my angels
Even though I was stupid but I put it down
Set trippin' - But I let it go headed for energetic flow
When I'm up to know that I was down and out
But now I'm breaded though
I know you saw me rep colors when I was young, dumb and malicious
I'm thankful, that all my blemishes never made you suspicious
Latched on to light
That's known to hype apparent you coherent knowing I rapped wrong to right
Love and positivity instilled in my kid
Their family my family their mother and I did
Discipline starts at home even if they can't stand you
Watch em' fights land, you clock em' right hand
To stop em' that a man to stand up even add a camera
They won't be James Holmes, and they won't be Adam Lanza
Or John Malvo, I'll flow loud for my child though
Ain't raising no groucho evil out my house yo
Instead a me watching em' disappear in the night
Air em' at graduation saying that's my kid right there

[Hook: Cee Lo Green]
I proudly proclaim my love
The future's born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters this time
So my prayer is that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
To my unborn I give my all so you could ball like I couldn't
Stay in school and play it smooth and do those things that I wouldn't
Pay attention and keep your distance from ignorant instances
Play a instrument anything that you want just envision it
Follow your dreams, no matter what may come or what may fall
Cuz' ain't no shame in failing as long as you know you gave your all
Staned up, man up, get a handle on yourself tighten your belt
Do what you can to do for you and ya'll just don't, do it for the wealth that they offer
It sounds awful but if me and your mama' ain't talking
And she said that I ain't offering a call just as often as I should
I pray that you get older and you understand that I was just, doing what I could
If she let me, if you have a second I could explain
Like so many transitions in life that people change
Whether I'm on top soil, or dead in a box
I love you dearly sincerely and that'll never stop
For my kid...
For my kid...

[Hook: Cee Lo Green]

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Paris and Darius Dariana Unique Oshay Malik
And one on the way in a matter of weeks
But it's a shame cuz' I think that my other daughter ain't mine
Andria baby I love you I guess your father was blind
In due time you'll understand it, how your mama' was scandelous,
(Wait this don't seem right man, I don't think I can handle it,)
When I all I ever did was show love for you
Sweated blood for you, any moment take a slug for you
But its cool, the baby mama drama is expected
And that karma is going to be what I been blessed with
Sit back and learn your lessons as our seeds grow from kids to adolescence
Then resent you for yourself as misdirection
The first to heed the message is Malik
Abandonded by his mama' on Thanksgiving evening
Bout' three years ago was up to me to feed to em morals
Values manhood, knowledge a week ago he graduated
You ask me, then Ima' say

[Hook: Cee Lo Green][Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Wrapped in XLR cables
Up from my whiskers, down to my fuckin' kicks
Wreck-O was echoed in Gordon Geckos, you suckin' dick
Nobody be askin' me for secrets, I ain't chuckin' tips
I'd rather be bumpin' hips on that ratchet with muffin tits
Tore up the limits from Britain visions would rock their lives
Inside a prison where giddy bitches don't jock the rhyme
Born in precision and rhythm spittin' could swat a fly
For them to just kick a single shillings from Spotify
Bye, Bye killers, on a high five business
Gonna ride by the sickest in your high ride to the hitlist
If we ain't spoke in ages then miss me with broken favors
You Miley Cyrus to majors, you twerkin' on swollen razors (run now)
Don't make me come to dinner, nail your tongue down
And have you plead your case to us in Strangeland at sundown
Be careful of the biz cause everything has got a price attached
Wake up with a horse head in your bed and next your life is snatched

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Tank full of petro, bank full of pesos
Pool on my tour bus, bonus on a payroll
Feel like I be killin' it, famous on the internet
Really I'm just wingin' it, cookin' shit on my kitchenette
Life so good right now, I need to celebrate!
Bout to sell a stadium out and turn it into rave!
Look at how the industry norm has started lookin' Strange
All my brothers riding the storm while they just ride the wave
Caviar wishes, bitches for my bitches
Black shades and hoodies and spots and white linens
Feel like Sam Kinison, preachin' to the citizens
Screamin' at the saints, "You ain't ever gonna get rid of us!"
Guessin' I just cleaned my plate so now I'm gettin' cake
Speedin' down the interstate, yellin' "Get out the fuckin' way"
We plant flags in the ground because we here to stand
I bring my whole hood out and have my own parade

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
(Black Gold!)
I purposely wrote this verse just to murder, dismember, defecate
Disassemble the limbs of a nigga who try and separate
Artistry from nonfiction, I'm sent with a conviction
To sentence you pawns givin' opinions on my addiction
"There he goes, speakin' bout how he merk a beat"
"Smellin' himself, why else would he flaunt about it so verbally?"
Dance around me like I was a paraplegic
In a do-si-do competition, lookin' pissed like I never heard of feet
"Yadda, yadda", a whole lotta yappin' about my rappin'
When I'm the captain of crunchin' you niggas' milky dreams
I'm the comparison of Pac face staring in your face
Mock razor blades, Kutt leave you crispy clean
Don't ask Tech, ask me if it's questions
Guarantee that he tell you that I'm the best and I'm destined
To find a snake and a bat, helpin' Kansas City's progression
Hopin' I hurt the feelings of whoever second guessed it cause
Everybody talkin', I'mma make you niggas hear me
Mind control flow, now, listen till your ears bleed

[Verse 4: Ubiquitous]
Spit it sicker than these sycophants, keep your dick up in your pants
You were blunted on the block, me, I had some different plans
I'm trying to get to France, sniffing grams, hit a branch
Independent Powerhouse, vibin' out, wit' the fam
Waking up in different cities every night, hittin' grants
Stay prepared for this, I'm bearing witness to the sin of man
Stripper dance with cinnamon, clubbin' with my gentlemen
Drink away the night's events, nothing worth remembering
Squad'll run up in this bitch, mobbin' like some immigrants
Jack you for your paper stack, rob you of your innocence
Taping off the scene of crimes, swabbing for my fingerprints
Thought about my life, you thought the same and couldn't think of shit
Ha! This type of fire don't extinguish
Now write about some bigger shit, you striking out, swing and miss
Ring around the Rosie, homie, pocket full of pain
Keep a lock up on my lane and triple optic in my brain, look

Ringing
Ubiquitous: “Yeah, what up?"
N9ne: "Ubi?"
Ubiquitous: "What’s going on man?"
N9ne: "Hold on… Travis is calling me, hold up."
N9ne: "What up, Trav?"
Travis: "What up man, I’m outside right now."
N9ne: "Alright, here I come."
Travis: "Alright."
N9ne: "Peace. Ubi! You got the bitches number from… So and so?"
Ubi: "From what? What, which bitch?"
N9ne: "That redheaded bitch from… dadadadada."
Ubi: "Oh, yeah yeah yeah. Want me to text it to you?"
N9ne: "Yeah text it to me right now. Love."
Ubi: "Aight peace.”[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Whoo, all my ladies all around the world

To get your man it's the fuck 'em girl
It's Friday night, just got paid
She's lookin' for a little bit of action captain to get saved

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
So you go straight to the mall and call your girlfriend up
Tell her you bought a fuck 'em dress
Nothing less-more-than-a thinner-sinner-Chris Dior fitter
You gotcha hair did or that there wig
Sho a fitter got your own sitter for that there kid
She's goin' out to find a thick stout to out her dig

She manicured and pedicured up and lookin' like you wanna
Your man's hittin' your phone up, say fuck 'em if you wanna
Lip gloss is on her blow that mirror a kiss and if your man
Got you stressin' put on your dress and don't listen and sing
I can't wait til I get there, step in the club lookin' player player
Grab your keys and beat it to the spot where you guess you'll
Find you a nigga buyin' a two for one special
Exceptional sexual healin' is what your cravin'
Your man pagin' you, but fuck how he's feelin'

[Hook] (2X)
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
It's your time to get out
No time for thinkin' of 'em

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Now this is a story, all about how
These chicks get tricked and don't know how
So I'd like to take a second and explain to them
How all this craziness evolves out of relationships, listen
He never used to hit you, he always used to treat you
With some respect and dignity, and now he wanna beat you
Six months done passed and he's changed
You never would have thought he'd be crazy and deranged, huh
Just the way he approached was so sweet
He let you know you was far away from a (Late night creep)
Mister telephone man when he what'nt with you
Bobby browny and Whitney, you found you a new edition
Right in the beginning it was grinings from the sit down
'Til he let you know that it was all on a bitch now
When, after you had you a baby, he wanna start
Arguing his excuse to start sipping the Remy Mar-
-Tin, darkening this relationship
Now every lady grab your bics if you relate to this
You need to get up out those drawers
And put on some lip gloss, throw on a thong
Now make your way to the closet and

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Feel like I was put here for the female species
Hella listening watching whispering offerings no feces
When the back is obese we double back and go deeply
In her life in her mind never hate but'll go extra time if need be
Easy for me to connect so peep me
In the club I take her some place we can talk discretely
You're creep free definitely that heats me
Your body's wop bobba lu bop so hot baby teach me
How to get up inside it ride it, chakras are now ignited
That's a beautiful smile, don't hide it
Getting Tech the N9ne excited
Stress free I bet she so Nestle
Wanna know how wicked the sex be don't test me
Drink your drink eat your cherry and tie the stem
This is your world mommy ain't said a damn thing about him

[Hook] (2X)[Intro: Tech N9ne]
B. Boys and B. Girls stand up
Down south, midwest, east coast, west coast
Globally, everywhere, yeah!

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (2X)
Swing first, I'mma destroy
You a curse, I'mma B. Boy!
Cherried up, got 'em P'noid
Let the whole world know, I'm a B. Boy!

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I watched Snoop do it, he let that blue flag hang
So watch Scoob do it, I'mma let the brown rag swang
Middle deuce to it, boy that's just a five six thang
Now SOO WOO! WOO! That's how we rep this gang
I ain't new to it, vill I got that bang in my veins
And I'm true to it, all I know is bangin' and 'caine
So get used to it, validation now I'm with Strange
OG villain off the block representer of them flames

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I pledge allegiance to the flag, my united hoods of [?]
I'm certified, around the top banging was so influencing
I made it with my heart, a vendetta, in hopes of unity
And left out a with family, a forty cal and a newer me
Deuce click represent, red rag regiment
Red rope replicates, whips runt recreate
Rest won't recommend, refs don't let you win
Red Rider Warriors we reppin' to find the testament we

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skatterman]
5"10', 235, hell of a left hook
Niggas think the feds came and got me when they got West Crook
A vent look, pull up stuntin' and get your vet took
Or we could stand mano a mano and get your best whooped
Knuckle up knucklehead, nigga been with this knuckle game
Still fuckin' with Scoob, Kutt and Kali, baby ain't nothin change (STRANGE!)
A drive for no paper work, organize drive-by's and your neighbor hurt
Send a couple down and hey you and your neighbor murked
Show you I ain't playin' fuck around and knock your neighbor first
It's Skatterman, pussy mortar just took virgins son
Who you think Tech gonna call to make sure that the dirt get done
Red cap, red shirt, red shoe strings
My .45 is a bitch, and I think she havin' mood swings (mood swings?)
You think them boys got guns watch what your dude bring
Fully auto AR-15, wipe out the Blue Team!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Beats bangin' better bring it big or bounce bitch
'Bout to blastin' in blood I'm back in this black brick
Boss ball I've been breakin' bread 'n baguettes brie
And beautiful biancas, videos, and Vegas with big B
Bow before brilliance, blessed to be buildin' it
Best in this barrio bane and bazaar we more bills in this
Bankin' his babies be blingin' and his boo be that big booty!
Big bust! Be in his benzo bronze and get big bucks!
I'm a black baboon, bring me bags of bananas
Bonefied, billy bad ass with a brown bandana
Been gone on Bacardi 'bou lou but I'm bout to be bigger bent
Better break if you bustin' before I'm blown and belligerent
Six deuce brims big in it, I'm bloated than Blimpy
Broades be blowin me in the back of the black Bentley
Never been about no babblin not bringing no bootsy
But I've been in the bay with big bond like shaboobalaboopy!

[Verse 5: Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo it's the OG Bumpy Knucks, Knucks I rolls with them B. Boys
B' walkin' round strapped up-up
You can talk that killer shit if you want my niggas
Guarantee that you'll get clapped up-up
See I'm the beast, your the bitch, I'm better battling baby
Me and the blood Tech Nina saddled up-up
And for the record nigga, check mine and you will find
That I shit legendary status niggas up-up
Come on, to be like bump ya gotta be a big ball breaker (Pow!)
Crack a nigga whole rack I'm like a jaw breaker (Crack!)
Knock you out and and hit them pockets like a cold hand
I'll bust your motherfuckin' shit and I'm an old man
They said my music was Strange until I made
Me sum change and now they ridin' my nuts-nuts
Tech N9ne's out the window, you see them
KC Killers ridin' by y'all niggas better duck-duck!
Come on!

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne]
Fight the pain, inside the rain
A rebel know, to let the devil go
So now to get paid, bout to be working like a slave

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I’m kinda good, kinda bad
Kinda getting money can’t be mad
I’m kinda broke but I’m kinda rich
Wishing I had a corner I could put a bitch in
Ain’t gon do nothing, ain’t like I’m suffering
Food for my baby mouth and I bought a house
For my baby mother and
What’s wrong? I try
Don’t matter, still die
I’m strong, but I’m not
When I’m alone, I cry
Out for you, is hard to do
I can’t see you, so doubt for you
And out my mouth, I sprout the noose
Too much Vodka, and Mountain Dew
Blaspheming ain’t what I be meaning, if you listen fast
You’d think I was a heathen, but the last
Sunday receiving the preaching from the pastor
And I ain’t even believing the bastard
But no Hades, God’s baby
God made me, a lil crazy
When I’m off, I’m gone, my life, is my songs
It's what I mean? When I sing, "still on a wing and a prayer"
But if I listen to what was written
In the scripture maybe it’ll get me there
Share with the people I swear it isn’t evil
Scared that it might be in vain
But if I say I’m the genius, and like Jesus
Everybody gonna know my name, Kali

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I’ve been working like a slave, oh Lordy
And I get tired a'long this lonesome journey
I done stumbled on the road, I’ve been wrong, I know
I know that there’s no peace, in my shelter

[Verse 2: Kutt Callhoun]
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
I need reparations due to devastations
From the state of present situations
And it’s not easy
To walk a narrow path and mock Jesus
It’s hard when you’re family wonderin
When you’re gonna make enough to stop leavin
Stop breathing for a minute cause it’s all
Artificial when them laws, tryna get you
When them haters right behind em
Wanna shove a double barrel sawed off, in your dental
What can I do to stop a big catastrophe
When niggas after me and bitches after me
Wanna have my baby, missing niggas lately
Trails and tribulations tackle me
My mama think I made it, she feeling elated
Proud of her only son born
My kids think I’m the greatest, I can not display a smile
Feelin like a Funion
Salty and all (You’ll be...)
Locked in a stall (...Tryin)
Lost in the cause (Truly...no denying)
Ain’t nobody gonna do it for me
For the MO, don't let it drive me insane
Solicitation of a prostitute
Cause you're a ho when you’re playing this game
But it’s okay I am gon ride till I triumph
Cause everybody once upon a time was a slave
This is Calhoun

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I work, I play, and I drink booze every day
Tryna muffle the blues I'mma say
You'se in the way, fools run astray
Allah, God, Jesus, Jah somebody please help me
Mama got a problem with diabetes it don’t seem healthy
Everything depends on N9na
Fame hitting Dontez Senior
Gotta nigga thinking some of the fans I’m making it
Will they wanna do me like Selena
Devil laughing like a hyena
Losing all the good in my demeanor
I don’t wanna go psycho but yo the flow ya know
I got to go and Charlie Sheen ya
Tryna stay good with the old lady
My mind made her go crazy
No time for my poor babies
So don’t let a motherfucker play me
When I say FU pay me
Even though I’m getting money, you can still see
I’m hungry like I’m in Haiti
What am I to do? What am I to you?
But a lot of cool? But I’m not amused?
Can’t you see? I’m stressed, not free
From y’all, I’m sick
My body’s hot, if 'n this pressure
Don’t let up, this will prolly stop for Tech N9na

[Hook](Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun)
Niggas don't wanna see me shine
I swear to God as my witness, it happens every time
They hate my climb, and block my lime
But lemme tell you this here little light of mine, it's fine
I was born by my God-damned self
Way I see it, I’mma die by my God-damned self
Lord willing, long as I be forgiven myself
I pray to God I’m not a burden for anybody else
Got my own two-step, keep my chin to the sky
All my so-called friends all done moved to the side
Got a drawer full of them bills, they pile sky high
Don't nobody give a damn and I don't care to ask why
That's why I be on a mission, I'm watching my own behind
My future is right in front of me, wifey is on my side
Middle finger to all you niggas who'd rather see me drown
They ain't like a nigga then, but they hate a nigga now
My game's too strong, my flow's too heavy
Ain't a thing slowed down since I first dropped B.L.E.V.E
If this money's up for the taking, then you better never let me
Snatch it down by my God-damned self, I'm ready

(Hook)
Do it all by my lonely
My own family disowns me
Surrounded by a lot of phoney homies
(x2)

(Verse 2: BG Bulletwound)
I feel trapped in it
That's why I'm posted on the block
At the spot with the chops
With the packs in it
Pill bottles filled up
With the crack in it
No more tours for the B
That's why I'm back in it
I'm out'chea
Cause I ain't got nobody
Yeah I hustle for this shit
Cause I ain't got nobody
Ain't no duffle bags
Tossed out, no Maseratis
Ain't no tossing on deals
Bottles and afterparties
Niggas look at you funny
They say he done with it
The same niggas you helped with a brand
And hung with it
See I don't fuck around
Fuck 'em niggas, fuck em now
I keep it moving like public transit
So buckle down
Yeah I'm deuce boy
Yeah I'm the truth boy
Yeah I got family that'll do ya dirty for the loot boy
A cold game in this motherfucker
It's like that
But I win the end homie
Despite that

(Hook)
(x2)

(Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun)
You see, a friend is always there when you ain't got it
As long as you got a true homie, you got an extra pocket
Wrong as you wanna be, they there to help ya fix the problem
All of the phonies be gone when you hitting rock
Fuck em against the wall, they babies don't grow
I'm the last of a dying breed living out the MO
My sucker repellent's on and my balls hung low
And say whatever I want cause real niggas say it's so
You heard I'm a beast, a monster in disguise
Ran as fast as you could, seen the envy in your eyes
Don't wanna see a nigga stack dough and get rich
You'd rather see a nigga flat broke and poor piss
Miss me with the B-U-Double L- shit
And every other hating nigga that you came with
This the "Whom it may concern", sign it to you with my dick
I'mma do it with or without you
Better phone me if I

(Hook)
(x2)

We get it in, we get it out (x3)
You ain't give a nigga shit, get the fuck up off my couch nigga[Intro: Kutt Calhoun]
It's still real out here, niggas
Niggas is still active through these streets, man
I had to call upon my nigga from Sac-town
816 and 916
Yo Spidey!


[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung] (x2)
No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right
Better not be light cause niggas is out there for your life
Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it
You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm from where most people hardly reach adulthood
Poverty stricken vultures, look odd and they go approach you
Obviously a notion to rob you of what you holdin
Probably be them soldiers, can't spot em cause they cloakin, scopin
In them 501s, hawkin
Them red bandanas, fallin
Out the right side of them pockets
These niggas is bangin so watch it
You know them 5’s is poppin
And they say them 6’s is droppin
In Kansas City, no problem
To lift a nigga up with his choppin
When bullets flyin, they gone
If you ain't bout it, stay home
First 48 with no snitchin niggas get split when they run
Miss in your face now it's caution tape all in front of they home
Thanks to the street the next time they see you's at Laurs and St. Jones
With the rest of your relatives situations'll never get
Cool with time
Especially if you rep to the death of it
See the boys in that denim, them 51s be the reckonin
In the reality maybe a little crazy but definitely

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
We get the bullshit - 501 in this hood shit
Hoodies for Trayvon Martin the subertine and the dueces
You youngin niggas is stupid, so clueless to what you doin
Get out of it while you can, find a life to live and pursue it
It's nothin to glorify when your homie is chopped in two and
You gotta make up a lie so his family won't be in ruins
Niggas they been through it before you, know the end of the story
Ain't no fame in this business pour out some liquor to mourn you
Homicide on the daily, see your best friends in the paper
Obituaries and memories got a ride for the later
Ain't nobody alive so the babies
Grow up avengeful and now you got genocide in the makin
It's a cycle, we all assault our rifles with us
Wanna be MJ, and that's just how we all endin up
Dead too soon, before our time, we had to go
Ain't no escapin the inevitable so, that's all we know

[Hook][Intro]
Yo, what's up where you at? (Leaving the club)
Meet me at the crib baby (Alright)
How many you got with you baby? (Three)
Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Alright)

*Phone rings* (Hello?)
What's up, where you at baby? (Leaving the spot)
Meet me at the crib baby (Okay)
How many you got with you? (Four)
Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Let's do it)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
After the club we usually go straight to Chubby's
That's where the 3 in the morning grub be
And even though Icons is lovely
Tonight the pad is gonna be a must see
Cause hussies are coming to give up they pussies, trust me
They comin' to muff me, plus three:
Makzilla, Irv and Big Nick we's 'bout to bust V
Open until we lust free, she sucked D
Gushed me, then roughly rode this ding-a-ling like a Huffy
Luck-ily, another 36 cup D abruptly, came into the room to fuck me
She said, "Tecca Nina touch me, your dick is thick and husky
It must be like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky"
Well, what do you know, baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy, unjustly I crushed, B!
And not one of these broads is ugly, 'til the next morning
When they crawl in they hubby Snuggie, looking rough as rugby

[Hook]
Yeah, we hit the spot if we choose her
Then she dipping out
To take her to my house (It's the afterparty)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your mama house
No but really (It's the afterparty)
And we all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Full of that liquor, ready to stick all this dick up in a-uh
Bitch out at Nina's, I never seen but I'm fixing to fuck
Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
"Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty
Tecca Nina I can't thank you enough for the afterparty

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
When freaks come out at night, the freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the afterparty, they got somebody take care of they baby
So it's cool, no rules, no security guards
Let your hair down, yeah, now do what you want
Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it

[Hook](Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun)
Niggas don't wanna see me shine
I swear to God as my witness, it happens every time
They hate my climb, and block my lime
But lemme tell you this here little light of mine, it's fine
I was born by my God-damned self
Way I see it, I’mma die by my God-damned self
Lord willing, long as I be forgiven myself
I pray to God I’m not a burden for anybody else
Got my own two-step, keep my chin to the sky
All my so-called friends all done moved to the side
Got a drawer full of them bills, they pile sky high
Don't nobody give a damn and I don't care to ask why
That's why I be on a mission, I'm watching my own behind
My future is right in front of me, wifey is on my side
Middle finger to all you niggas who'd rather see me drown
They ain't like a nigga then, but they hate a nigga now
My game's too strong, my flow's too heavy
Ain't a thing slowed down since I first dropped B.L.E.V.E
If this money's up for the taking, then you better never let me
Snatch it down by my God-damned self, I'm ready

(Hook)
Do it all by my lonely
My own family disowns me
Surrounded by a lot of phoney homies
(x2)

(Verse 2: BG Bulletwound)
I feel trapped in it
That's why I'm posted on the block
At the spot with the chops
With the packs in it
Pill bottles filled up
With the crack in it
No more tours for the B
That's why I'm back in it
I'm out'chea
Cause I ain't got nobody
Yeah I hustle for this shit
Cause I ain't got nobody
Ain't no duffle bags
Tossed out, no Maseratis
Ain't no tossing on deals
Bottles and afterparties
Niggas look at you funny
They say he done with it
The same niggas you helped with a brand
And hung with it
See I don't fuck around
Fuck 'em niggas, fuck em now
I keep it moving like public transit
So buckle down
Yeah I'm deuce boy
Yeah I'm the truth boy
Yeah I got family that'll do ya dirty for the loot boy
A cold game in this motherfucker
It's like that
But I win the end homie
Despite that

(Hook)
(x2)

(Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun)
You see, a friend is always there when you ain't got it
As long as you got a true homie, you got an extra pocket
Wrong as you wanna be, they there to help ya fix the problem
All of the phonies be gone when you hitting rock
Fuck em against the wall, they babies don't grow
I'm the last of a dying breed living out the MO
My sucker repellent's on and my balls hung low
And say whatever I want cause real niggas say it's so
You heard I'm a beast, a monster in disguise
Ran as fast as you could, seen the envy in your eyes
Don't wanna see a nigga stack dough and get rich
You'd rather see a nigga flat broke and poor piss
Miss me with the B-U-Double L- shit
And every other hating nigga that you came with
This the "Whom it may concern", sign it to you with my dick
I'mma do it with or without you
Better phone me if I

(Hook)
(x2)

We get it in, we get it out (x3)
You ain't give a nigga shit, get the fuck up off my couch nigga(Intro)
To all my strippers around the world (turn this one up y'all)
This yo Kutty buddy (y'all know what time it is)
Bought to you a part by Black Gold (Kutt Calhoun)
So make your money baby, this one's for you (salute)

(Verse 1)
I may not make it rain but love how you wet in the storm
Booty, your legs and your arms
Dancing so sexy you got me (buggin)
You make me want some (lovin')
With your hands all on my dick and VIP we gon' be (lovin')

And I'mma sneak a touch
Your Cuddy gon' squeeze your butt
Plus my cousin he's the bounce he ain't gon speak or nothing
Babe I ain't in love with you per say , I'm in love with your hustling
They way you tend to break these niggas with art of seduction
That's cudos, get your money bitch 2 4's
365 used used drop 100 now you push your legs cucudo
Niggas used to play Tracy but now y'all rocking new clothes
Louie V's, Gucci that, this what you tell them new hoes

(Hook)
Turn it up if you know how to work that pole
Know how to drop it low, slide it down touch the floor
Pick them one's up, watch 'em hit the ground
Don't be ashamed just play loud and say
This right here's your anthem
This right here's your anthem
This right here's your anthem
Go and pick them ones up
This right here's your anthem
This your fucking anthem
This right here's your anthem
This your fucking anthem

(Verse 2)
I love a go getter who's good with the pole tricks and
Body is so thick that you dying to go tip her
Lie on the floor and do this bliss y'all rating those big ol G's
Got every other rookie dancer looking so bitter
They call her Diamond she the kind to get that old nigga
Tricking off that mortgage money in the back of long wigger
But I ain't mad girl, go and get your cash girl
Shake just what your mama gave to you to make a fast buck
She presidential, Michelle Obama
The kind I'm into , my baby mama
No crazy drama just know how to make you want her
And in return I just tell the Dj to turn this song on

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
To every woman stripping do just what you do
Break these niggas get that paper baby do the fucking fool
If ain't nobody told you I'mma tell you, you the fucking truth
A man's world but with a woman's touch all of us salute
So this right here your anthem, you feel it throw your hands up
From the east coast to the west coast and everywhere where dancer
If anybody knocking and questioning what you do
Tell him y'all up in here tipping and stripping you should do this

(Hook)[Hook:]
Here we go again with the drama
Fucking like fools with my baby mama
Pushing me alone but she wants so I'm a
I'm a turn the table and bring the drama
I'm about to go in on my beat
I'm about to go in on my beat
I'm about to go in on my beat, about to go in
About to go in

[Verse 1:]
I should've never drank that liquor
I should've used a condom
But that's my bad
Something I got to live with it
If I had my choice to do it all again
I would've kept it moving
Without even acknowledging your existence
About the deadest beat mama
A child could never have
A coke using alcoholic
You foul with no class
Sitting, waiting on the checks the arrive that you cash
Don't even spend it on my son then wanna turn around and ask me for more money
Trying to get more from me
Bitch I got 7 seven mouths to feed
You think that you the only person with a kid
Trying to pay the bills, how about getting off your lazy ass
To work at a job it's been years
You think that just because you provide a place to live
That's raising them?
Nah that's just rumor in your crib
Your own mama said I need to come and grab it quick
That's a shame when the grandma saying you unfit

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
My son an honor roll student, football star
Exerting his use
Gotta sit around and listen
To all your verbal abuse
Because your life ain't shit so when you get hurt from the truth
Go and take it out on him cause life ain't working for you
He looking for a job and I'm bout to buy him a car
You ain't never had a job and you live at the local bar
Sleeping with everybody and being the ho you are
When he graduate, he coming straight to me and his step mama
Smack in the face saying you mad
Cause I make payments out to his grandma
Cause she got my son back faded
While you got the courts up in our business about a back payment
Bitch I ain't no Eminem so why you trying to act shady

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Another unworthy candidate I never should've hit plus
A mass aching freak I need to cover my dick up
Ain't gotta, don't gotta, can't keep a job
But you won't up the child support and get it modified
Paying every month and piano lessons too
What I do for all my 7 kids most niggas wouldn't even do
For one, why you talking, you think because I'm touring
And I got money out the cooler, bitch, you better get to walking
It's about the QT that we spend when he over
Not about you and me, but you bending me over
Trying to fuck with no grease, I refuse to be Rover
Don't except nothing next, that's what I told her so

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne]
B. Boys and B. Girls stand up
Down south, midwest, east coast, west coast
Globally, everywhere, yeah!
Tech N9ne now! Let's go!

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (2X)
Swing first, I'mma destroy
You a curse, I'mma B. Boy!
Cherried up, got 'em P'noid
Let the whole world know, I'm a B. Boy!

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I watched Snoop do it, he let that blue flag hang
So watch Scoob do it, I'mma let the brown rag swang
Middle deuce to it, boy that's just a five six thang
Now SOO WOO! WOO! That's how we rep this gang
I ain't new to it, vill I got that bang in my veins
And I'm true to it, all I know is bangin' and 'caine
So get used to it, validation now I'm with Strange
OG villain off the block representer of them flames

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I pledge allegiance to the flag, my united hoods of [?]
I'm certified, around the top banging was so influencing
I made it with my heart, a vendetta, in hopes of unity
And left out a with family, a forty cal and a newer me
Deuce click represent, red rag regiment
Red rope replicates, whips runt recreate
Rest won't recommend, refs don't let you win
Red Rider Warriors we reppin' to find the testament we

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skatterman]
5"10', 235, hell of a left hook
Niggas think the feds came and got me when they got West Crook
A vent look, pull up stuntin' and get your vet took
Or we could stand mano a mano and get your best whooped
Knuckle up knucklehead, nigga been with this knuckle game
Still fuckin' with Scoob, Kutt and Kali, baby ain't nothin change (STRANGE!)
A drive for no paper work, organize drive-by's and your neighbor hurt
Send a couple down and hey you and your neighbor murked
Show you I ain't playin' fuck around and knock your neighbor first
It's Skatterman, pussy mortar just took virgins son
Who you think Tech gonna call to make sure that the dirt get done
Red cap, red shirt, red shoe strings
My .45 is a bitch, and I think she havin' mood swings (mood swings?)
You think them boys got guns watch what your dude bring
Fully auto AR-15, wipe out the Blue Team!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Beats bangin' better bring it big or bounce bitch
'Bout to blastin' in blood I'm back in this black brick
Boss ball I've been breakin' bread 'n baguettes brie
And beautiful biancas, videos, and Vegas with big B
Bow before brilliance, blessed to be buildin' it
Best in this barrio bane and bazaar we more bills in this
Bankin' his babies be blingin' and his boo be that big booty!
Big bust! Be in his benzo bronze and get big bucks!
I'm a black baboon, bring me bags of bananas
Bonefied, billy bad ass with a brown bandana
Been gone on Bacardi 'bou lou but I'm bout to be bigger bent
Better break if you bustin' before I'm blown and belligerent
Six deuce brims big in it, I'm bloated than Blimpy
Broades be blowin me in the back of the black Bentley
Never been about no babblin not bringing no bootsy
But I've been in the bay with big bond like shaboobalaboopy!

[Verse 5: Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo it's the OG Bumpy Knucks, Knucks I rolls with them B. Boys
B' walkin' round strapped up-up
You can talk that killer shit if you want my niggas
Guarantee that you'll get clapped up-up
See I'm the beast, your the bitch, I'm better battling baby
Me and the blood Tech Nina saddled up-up
And for the record nigga, check mine and you will find
That I shit legendary status niggas up-up
Come on, to be like bump ya gotta be a big ball breaker (Pow!)
Crack a nigga whole rack I'm like a jaw breaker (Crack!)
Knock you out and and hit them pockets like a cold hand
I'll bust your motherfuckin' shit and I'm an old man
They said my music was Strange until I made
Me sum change and now they ridin' my nuts-nuts
Tech N9ne's out the window, you see them
KC Killers ridin' by y'all niggas better duck-duck!
Come on!

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne, Kutt Calhoun and random woman]
[T] Let's go holler at her real quick
[K] Ooh shit, we gotta do that
[T] What's your name baby?
[W] Bianca...
(Tech and Kutt both start laughing)
[W] What'chu laughin' for?
[T] (still laughing) Ah nothin', nothin' baby it's cool, you know what I'm sayin

[Hook:]
Bianca’s and Beatrice’s are known for wettin' mattresses
And bendin' over in the ill positions
Bianca's and Beatrice's they love the way I'm rappin' this
I dig 'em then I pluck 'em then I diss 'em

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm kickin it wit this chick up in the club I'm off the Lou
And when you're on that Caribou you know just what you do
I called her Bianca, then she said "What is that Bianca shit?"
I looked and cracked a smile and said Bianca means you, bitch
You's a Bianc' baby, whether you like it or not
But you hot especially when x and vicodin popped
If you trippin' you can hike it and hop
Cause you know what I came to do
Me and my villains come to strike it and stop
Pipe it and prop, ya leg up and get up
Bianca hold ya head up, ya sex wet the bed up
Everybody's ponderin', wonderin' about my slang that I spit
You can use it when you refer to a dame or a chick
Don't be trippin' about the choice of words I'm usin' on this script
Don't step off in my face cause you can bet I come equipped
You wanna know what to say to get the Bianc' to let you blend? (What?)
Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
You that new green nigga Kutt Calhoun (Who that?)
You know that big-lip pretty nigga wit the gold teeth (oh) be rapping with Tech
Heard he just signed a big deal, an estimated 5 or 6 million
That nigga fine if he willing, I'mma blow his mind (bitch!)
Big lips and all the things involved got your whole brain dissolved
You couldn't squeeze in these drawers if you was my dick and balls
I tell you man, theses dames are lame, greedy, raunchy, and dykes
A nigga gets a bit of fame and Bianca’s be like:
(Sow yo' ro-yal oats,)
Biatrice's sayin' (Hell yeah yeah yeah yeah)
But Kutty be like (Ho no slow yo' roll)
Buffoon to busy tryin' to zoom off into the (upper room!)
Claiming they Cath-o-lic, licking asses, off ecstasy
Weed and hashes, and hits of acid, addressing me
Just ‘cause I rap, bitch you gettin’ nasty
Gone wit'cho nasty ass pizzazz ashy slash sassy, Beatrice!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Biatrices means more than one Bianca
They actresses, bring 'em sex toys and ganja
We activists, ain't no yes boys, we monsters
And macks at this, ring ya best noise we conquer
The fact is this: say you don't wanna when you want to
Relax to this ecstasy and Willy Wonka
We slaps a bitch, 'cuz me and my niggas are bonkers
We stacks the hits, no Coleco, Tyco, or Tonkas
Emaculate get the motherfucker you honor
A laxative, cause they boo-boo bitin' piranhas
My gats'll spit, 'til you player haters are goners
Like Maximus, I'm gladiator for na-na
My raps assist the beat that disturbin' ya mama
They scrap to this, welcome wicked witness the trauma
So clap to this, while you puffin' yo' marijuana
Get back to this, (what) Biatrice's and Bianca's

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Tech N9ne talking]
Yo, yo, yo, baby…
I’m so sorry if your name is Bianca or Beatrice…
I know they givin' you a hard time about it, you know what I’m sayin'? (laughs)
Ey yo, it’s just some lingo, though, Tech N9ne lingo, you know what I’m sayin?
My brother Dyno Mack, he’s a god damn fool, came up with that shit in LA, doe
Baby I’m so sorry, you know what I’m sayin', if your name is Bianca, and Beatrice, hey…
(laughs)[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Konichiwa bitches come visit I call it the apartment
A 6 by 3 of whatever brings out your inner woman
I rock your body the twat is creamy and hot as sake
Let me inside and I'll let you ride on my Kawasaki
Let me get a bit of that bump bump bump bump bump bump bump action
And ima hit you with the bump bump bump bump hump re-hump action
I got your number, baby you might wanna slumber
Party over with a undercover brother who wonder
To find out what the D like inside in-between thighs
(Baby won't you tell me what that be like)
I got a fist full of hair and you ain't going nowhere
Right I'm done kissing your pear right on as you wanna stare
Cover your face up with the bedspread you letting the legs spread
(Damn girl you know you got the bed wet)
Now you calling me humongous stroking you with the thunda
I have to say I love the way you bunk rock

[Hook]
You ain't never seen a broad
Panties off and just offer herself like this
(Bunk rock bitch)
You ain't never seen a broad
Get her rocks off a rockstar nigga like this
(So little mama)
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
You know the team and the way we drill
Cause after the party, it's after the party
On the bus with a bunk rock bitch

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
You feisty and finicky
Half a bottle of Hennessy
Tour bus can for sure bust
And you full of that energy
Ain't no doubting your southern routing
It's pure and replenishing
Once you swallow now follow me to the back let's come get in-between
The top and the bottom fuck off in the middle for me
Once I swallow a little pill those other rappers symbolize the pompus more sweet
Kutty Cal you're working with something baby boy don't be rough with me
Cause you know I got a boyfriend established when we do it he'll be known as C
That's when she put on the magnum with her mouth wouldn't feeling no teeth
And then she hopped on the dragon bringing out the villian in me
Got a little bit of something for nothing put my name in the pussy for sheezy
Can't wait to get a bump full of loving next time when I'm in her city
And I got my mojo and tack right give women that act right
My foreplay is the crack but then my dick is the glass pipe
My bunk is the hideout nobody will find out
When she leaves she tweaking looking all spooked cause she high now (on the bunk rock)

[Hook]

It goes, one little, two little, three little, bunk rocks then
Four little, five little, six little, bunk rocks then
Seven little, eight little, nine little, bunk rocks
More than ten of them bitches share some stories with me
I had fun with them, hung with them, plunged in they hot spots
I tongue split them, done did them, flung them and dropped it
And got drunk with them, sung with them, sprung them if not
Then I bet you none of them ever speak bad about me
To all the ladies who will be your dishes be on the lookout we in your town
Cause I'm looking for a team of butch for her skin and ain't scared to put it down
You can be black and Chinese, or a heavenly mix breed whatever it's gonna be we'll go
Cause I want the Prada, Gucci or Hadana, even when you wearing your nadas, gonna hit the floor
To all the ladies across the globe who ain't been in the bunk
We can do it in the bedroom or bathroom, Buick or whatever you want
An invitation to me sensation I'll mail it to some
But if you impatient get tired of waiting catch mail in this bunk

[Hook](Verse 1)

Is this what this shit is all about can someone tell me
Why these blood, sweat and tears, years I give seem so unhealthy
Like seeing the beast unmasked for the first time so unveiling
Yet its heartful
It went from thoughtful
To feeling heartbroke
And so its melan
Thinking about being on the stage with them nigga's
Sweating giving you whatever you paid for them tickets
No it is not another act today that just give it
To you like in the way we do makes it exquisite
Making this hittits
Taking this trippits
Goin' on the internet and facing this critics
Saying "his sickic" is great to hear
But all the compliments it ain't paying me shitic

Its like this music thing is my drug habit and your making me kick it
But on the other hand me having to go without it would make me get sinic?
Gather you to prevent that all it would take is a little bit of basic incentive
Cause I dont think know that without your support a career would flaking and finish

So take a quick minute
Put your whole damn face in this business
See what I go through on a daily when numbers don't add up and take a quick visit
Though the mind where patience was given', find the grave and pray for this nigga
Got my whole life written in pencil and all your doing is erasing this livin'

(Hook)

Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
With everyone in the world to see in me and I don't know who's to blame
Cause I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name

(Verse 2)

If I just happen to stop it would be catastrophic
But since this matter of topic
Lets get back to options
I could just get a job and get right back to docking
Move in a wack apartment and confine myself into a one room shack is hardly
What can happen?
I wouldn't make enough to provide for the family without the rapping
But your asuming
That we get paid good
Cause we keep touring
But in actuality
You dont know about this game, nigga you dont know about this rain
You dont know about the six kids that I have to feed nigga when the stomach got pains
Its so insane
Cause I'm making a hit they come and takin, it all away
And before I consolidate
Nothing to salvage, from hearing my daughter say
"there goes the gifts for the holidays"
But we all OK
Is what I hear, when I know its just words of comfort
Is what I fear, if I own nothing else I know one thing
If you don't buy records, I don't eat
If I don't eat, then its time to go and count on streets
If I don't leave, my 7 to a jail house cell then my destiny is 6 feet hollow deep
And thats all I need
A Rest In Peace for poor old me
I'm hearing that everybody love me
Boy you got a real good way of showing me

(Hook)

Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
With everyone in the world to see in me and I don't know who's to blame
Cause I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name

(Verse 3)

If I could go back to when all of this happened and start when rappin was innocent
Where niggas was happy you did it a rally for love when streets were replenishin'

But those are my sentiments
Now the shit is so menacin'
Venom in many men
Give them an in
And they would go in your window
And load right up under your nose
In a minute man

How can I get it back
Im too addicted with
Signing this autographs
Taking this pictures with
People I never knew
Its in my ligaments
Im just compelled to do
Whats in my spirit when
Everything is genuine
Hand me that sliver pen
I get strait with you
Right after this gentlemen
Tired as fuck
But I'm full of adrenaline
Cause I just dont know
When I can do it again
Fresh off the stage
After giving you energy
Best show you ever seen
Everyone witnessed it
Im so committed
Its highly ridiculous
Song after song at 310%
Mingle with kids on the floor
Right before we go on
And that's so they know I'm official with
Keeping it real
But it ain't increasing the sales
It feels like I'm a new lyricist

And this ain't no Tech N9ne flow
How many Kutt Calhoun's Tech N9ne know
Tech my bro
And be the the first nigga that will tell mothafucka's "betta check my growth"
So unless I croak
I ain't never gonna rest my throat
And when I depend
On the likes of men
Cause god gon bless my soul

(Hook)

Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
With everyone in the world to see in me and I don't know who's to blame
Cause I don't hear, don't hear you calling my nameColors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors

[Hook] 2X
Colors, live my life solemnly I'm a ride for my
Colors, blood in and blood out because niggas died for my
Colors, whoever whenever all day all night for my
Colors, my nigga I'm probably gonna die for my

[Verse 1, Kutt]
Started in '85 when my town got turned out
Niggas from Cali brought it to the mid and we learned how
Blue or red paisleys powders was the start of a war now
Unification that got the whole nation concerned now
Middle of '91 I was jumped by a cuz hive
Solely the reason I was introduced to the blood life
Niggas about they money make it sunny at night fly
Whips and bitches and everything was hung from the right side
We gettin' it back bangin' and brawlin' you feelin' me
Strapped with heavy artillery on the streets and it's kill or be killed
40's of malt liquor and sherm was instilled in me
Taught to dump on any niggas from different facilities
Real talk and it's real life it's dangerous ain't it
Suburbanites better think twice if your thinkin' of bangin'
Whatever town that you in if it's rippin' or flamin'
Throw your bandanas in the sky and rep the gang that you claimin' cuz this is

[Hook]

[Verse 2, Joe Vertigo]
I been so whoopin' and saggin' an OG status red raggin' it
As long as niggas been hatin' the blood I bust ain't been havin' it
Flaggin' it, it's drippin' thick just like a bitch on her menstral
Lets get straight to the point just like them things in my pistol
These are the missiles that'll show you what the blood do
Blood in blood out, now you got the blood drippin' from your mouth
I'm a shout (soo-woop, soo-woop) watch them rellies go
NIgga know if you ain't come to bang what you come here for
I'm fo sho bangin' on the block I throw them B's up
Bustin' bustin' bitches black bernellies make em freeze up
Ease up I got some shit that'll plant you like a tree stump
Givin' em the bidness bang with strange nigga please jump
Knuckle up take it to the streets take our shirts off
Go straight for throat like a coyote and snatch your skirt off
I'm that nigga that'll bring em to your block
Nigga fuck bein' a goblin I'm a motherfuckin' ???

[Hook]

[Music stops, Kutt speaking]
Hey don't get it twitted nigga
I got a little crip nigga that don't fuck around
Hey yo Riv, eat they face nigga

[Verse 3, Riv Locc]
Hellish contained the covenant and the true proof
I rep the same colors that BIG Tookie and Snoop do
Color coordinated goin' to war makin' my knowledge evolved
Beefin' with heat over (colors) homie lilke Rocket and Frog
When we choppin' poppin' watch your parners drop and dissolve
I can't be touched too long like a hot object honestly dog
See I'm a night crawler (vivid) just like relivin' the true dream
You can tell I'm true by the (colors) of my shoe strings
Yeah I'll muder your ambitions
In the game'll cut deen in ya like a surgical incision
With verbulan intuition from a vertical position
I represent a word that has no definition
Authentic, genuine pure than a soul of a chrsitian
Lyrically the big homie Kutty expose a depiction
(Colors) fluctuate to keep a pistol in your waist line
I got the whole city behind my back like a state line

[Hook][Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Somebody gotta tell me why my pockets ain’t lined with nothing
Got me contemplating about doing a crime or something
I think about it three weeks, and all that I could come up with
Is liquor store hold-ups, back to drinking O.E
Lights about to get shut off, gas tank is on E
And my bitch is on my heels, but this ain’t where she want to be
Nigga, I can do better, keep running through my mind and
And now I’m locked in this room with some solitary confine shit
Plottin’ a quick come up, and thinkin’ ‘bout where my kid’s next meal gon’ come from
And nigga then it hit me, all I need is a costume and mask to conceal this
Bring up massive destruction as this bad superhero
Days late to complete, with a kay drape in the feet
And a AK for the heat, not a safe place in the streets
Thinkin’ payback’s sweet and it’s time to punish y’all
Standing at the mirror as the bloodhound, underdog

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I don’t want to, do the things I do
Why would I want to, do these things to you
Yeah, I’ma have to get bloody buddy
Motherfuckers won’t love me
I could really get ugly muddy
Silly like that putty Kutty
We gon’ have to get bloody plucky
Knocking him out like we go, he know, he go
Hard like mad niggas, bad superhero

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I can't afford to go small
Either get nothing or get it all
Think about it, turned around
Finished 'em all
All night to work the late shit
Escape with two trash bags full of cash
Stabbed to the pad, hop the stash bag fully macked
Ready to do another
Getting easier and easier
The moment I shot a brother, didn't even think of reasoning
Masquerade through the street, as I lurk in the night shadows
Pickin' em one by one like a pimple
And uh-oh there's one heading toward the door toward me
Had to asphyxiate the strong one
Cause she was a screamer
Lay down to red bandana
Stampped with a paw print over her face
Start leaving the trademark
As I pick up the keys to her car
Tomorrow nights first priority
I concur to take it from the rich
And give it to myself, because I'm sure I deserve it
I used to feel worthless, somehow I feel fit that
Now I'm serving my purpose, bloodhound, underdog

[Hook]

Verse 3 (Brotha Lynch Hung)
It's Mr. nine one siccness, most niggas ain't get they dick split
Bitches ain't gettin they clit bit
Intimate to gettin it rippin' it infinite leavin a nigga impotent
In a funny way it gets me lit like it's the creeper through the night, CATCH ME
Speaking with your wife, catch me
Sleeping with your wife, catch me
Eating up your wife, catch me
Eating up the night
I'm onicuous I'm straight sicc as shit
You better believe it like Ripley's I'm a have a hissy fit; and it's strictly a bitch
And they give me a kick out of it then I'm about to get out of here bendin up fifty quick!
I smoke like 50 zips... Kutt give me the clip
Wow! Ooh!
I'm just killing em up with Calhoun!
I paid dues and it didn't get me shit
Niggas is dreaming I'd get to cleaning and leaning up out of the beamer, they bleeding
I'm 'bout to be eatin this evening and I hate to deceive
Some people say that's it's evilm I just say that's it's me though: I see dead people

[Hook][Hook] (2X)
Down for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Down for the block like Shaq O'Neil
Me and my niggas hitting corners in the Batmobile
My block so hot so keep you enough shots
You slip and you fall niggas get chalked like hopscotch
On my block I'm in cahoots with what's going on
Take me out the hood but the hood will never leave me
I'm holding on as if I'm falling off the edge of a cliff
If I live to see 80 I'm reppin' the bricks
Real shit leaning like a syrup sipper
Henny and sprite mix it up get a cup nigga
Pour out some liquor for my niggas who ain't living on the surface
After the bottle we load our clips and put in work
Block shit stay in the house when they set tripping
A hundred rounds hit niggas and wet women
East side 9-double-0-5-9
Watts, California, I ain't hard to find
Shit I'm down for the block

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm down for the block like I'm down for my wife
And if you niggas fuck with either, then it's down with your life
I got no mercy for your fuck ups or the way that you behave
And represent that from the cradle to the grave
On my partner he was taught you got to get it how you spit it
Shoeboxes throw rocks hawk spit or talk shit
Killer city better watch ya might get set up by some hoes
Better do what Alvin Ailey do and stay up on your toes
Got the deuces and the Dre's click clacking in the paint
A hard method of survival try to shake it but ya can't
Rather win, lose or draw stand your ground and hold your weight
And if your still can see your ribs get ya weight up, quit your hate
Cause niggas know when in a food fight you wouldn't bust a grape
Spike clicks probably better off chopping with the K
I'm down for my block and I love my town
So Killer City stand up and Kutty Cal can stay hound

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Say the word, watch me bust your shit
I'm the realest motherfucker with this stranged out clip
Suck the willa on the realer, I ain't playing with you niggas
Godzilla with the milla get to spraying at you niggas
Yeah, check my history, nigga, when you mention me
Bet they say I'm in the street, ride her nigga for the V
Fuck the industry, fucking what you think of me
I don't give a fuck, bet you pussies be respecting me
I love the block, cause my sign in the prime time
You niggas faked your steady lying in your fucking rhymes
Saw a nigga, hella twisted off the R nigga
Gutter butter, I be seeping like a ball nigga
Dessert eagle for the people, I be busting lethal
Know the cola for the soldier, but this all legal
For the block, I'll be screaming villain non-stop
5, 6 on a mission take it to the top

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Ey, red drawers, red socks, red everything
Look what they've done to me crazier than I've ever been
Like I needed medicine, I don't think it's eratapheme
That is seen, second lettering
This ho-head plus wanted me to rep the block
Sadly I missed the block
Badly and the ones that came before me Dr. Bop and Rock
Daddy, plus being surrounded by real niggas was my big thrill
Cause I was walkin by stand-up niggas from 56 Ville
They helped me get my cheese up, love my K-I-D's much
Thats why I would never freeze up when its time to throw B's up
We need a Jesus to relieve us when millies bust
Now we're over seas plus with euros and visas
58th, 57th, 56th, 55th
That's my area and I rep it with the quick
How many homies it be grips and they on the sippy trip
Down for the block and it's the same shade
As the homie Mitchy Slick, nigga

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne]
The sadness gets deeper, and now my body's growing weaker
To EMJ this is dedicated; through this, you'll never belated, bro

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I told him, I ain't know you rap nigga, you cold blooded
The way he busted his flow on stage wasn't slow was it
My nigga was flippin', he grabbed the mic and was rippin'
Until some idiots was trippin' and then I heard bullets whistling
Then I sang 'em, I just want to celebrate, he laughed
Cause said he's "writing a song called Reno 911 straight on they ass"
Far as words go, it's crazy them were the last I heard
EMJ on this emotional musical journey

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Come ride with me, it's so sad to see, still ride with me
So join me, let me share with this world as I live out the dreams
We won't be gone for long, I promise you won't be alone
If you lose me, I'm writing the words of this song
My man Michael Jones, on this emotional musical journey

(Yo, this is OG Muggs, wanna shout out to my man EMJ
God took you away, it was too soon man
You're up there with the angles looking down
And watching our world right now brother
We love you, we miss you, we'll never forget you EMJ
Rest in peace brother)

[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]
That was my nigga
In the bunk right across from mine
Cracking them jokes like all the time
Hoppin' on stage with him every night
And why niggas
Would ever wanna take somebody's life
Who was living it like a shining light
Man all the homie ever did was smile
I still don't understand it, don't think I ever will
Why I couldn't have been the bitch nigga
That god had let get killed
Instead he took EMJ away, it's safe to say
I'll see your face again someday, at pearly gates
But I hold you in my heart until

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
At times I'm like
Yo EMJ, where you been?
I know you lookin' down on me like
"Here I am, Kutty!
And I ain't wanting for nothin' homie
No, mourning do nothin' for me
Your love is enough in store in its glory
Or what, so pour me a drink
We can cheer and toast, giving thanks to why
You didn't lose a partner, you gained a gangsta for life
In your heart I exist, but through music I'm able to live
I see the way you floss me all on your wrist
And that's what's up, man"

[Hook]

(On my highest day my nigga, you was there
Now I'm on my lowest day, cause you're not here
I miss you my nigga, love you EMJ)

[Verse 4: Bernz]
I seen a cruel bitch, met her in Reno Nevada
She'll have you living your dreams and take 'em all with no problem
In dark alley ways, where devils wait for the shootout
At someone who was special, I told my family about him
I saw his first tour, he told me Tech was his hero
And watched him from the crowd, to then go rock the same theaters
Step out of bounds and rounds can fly, behind casinos
On the night I never gambled and still lost it all in Reno

[Verse 5: Wrekonize]
If I only had 8 bars, to come and deliver to you in the graveyard
I'd say god is shitty for even releasing you behind the 8-ball
The pain's hard, I know you got kiddies to carry your name on
But I'm praying for 'em, so they don't end up just singing the same song
I'm hearing it in my sleep, I'm hearing it in the head
There's whispers on the beat, screaming EMJ where you been
I promise you everyone out here shed tears, until he remembers
High powered mayhem, EMJ, Mayday's 7th member

[Verse 6: Stevie Stone]
Remember like it was yesterday, show up in Reno
Off of the bus and to off a Bourbon then we hit the Casino
And then we, we did the show an we was only
It was all that crying and you and Rock was on that homie
Never should have left you lonely, you took six and survived it
Talked to you a couple days ago, still riding
No one never thought there was complications rising
A blood clot inside him, EMJ died I'm like

(EMJ, it's Cross-Eyed Joe man, we all fucking miss you bro)
(EMJ, what can I say man, rest in paradise
Rest in paradise pimpin, we love you)

[Verse 7: Jay Rock]
Michael Jones, I miss you my nigga
EMJ, still tryna cope with this
Still can't believe that you gone and I know I gots to be strong
Revenge is mine said the lord, so we gotta let him take control
But lord knows that I wanna grab the gat
Cock back and land a blow and watch heads roll
You was a talented man, I watched you gravitate fans
Shouted out where you been, people was all in a trance
Then we step on stage, you'd say "You killin 'em, Rock"
Then I'd say "You killin 'em, MJ," then you say "Let's put on for Watts"
You strong as an ox, in the bed just laying with shots
Laughing and jokin', meanwhile I'm going through emotions
Then you tell me Jay Rock, you gotta keep goin' on daddio
Your album about to drop, plus you can't be slacking bro
Yeah fo' sho' my nigga, I know this a minor set back
But you told me keep killin' 'em, you gon' be alright
I'mma be back, no time bet that, then I got that phone call
It was bad news at its best and it hurt me
That I lost my friend on this emotional musical journey

[Verse 8: Magnum PI]
Hold up roll up a Swisher, light up and paint a picture
Only if painted different, I would have been right there with you
So instead of cryin', I rejoice and pour out some liquor
Henny straight or mix it with lemonade, feel like I should be ashamed
I had to look you mama dead in the face
She told me everything was gon' be okay
You told me if anything you should be on your way home any day
Soon as we all relaxin' the phone rang, heard her sayin'
I'm goin' crazy, it's crazy, I'm thinkin' maybe just maybe
I'm misunderstandin' what your lady was sayin'
Naw-naw, you can't be serious, stop your talkin' delirious
Got my mom on the phone, you already know where his spirit went
So I drink that Hen 'til there no more left, right that wrong no it don't go left
Write this song try not stress, gotta be strong yet fight to death
As far as visions go that's that was last way that I saw
EMJ on this emotional musical journey

[Hook]So we rolling, just left Billings, Montana, did a dope ass show. We in a 15 passenger van, heading to Spokane, Washington. We driving along the interstate, we go over this bridge, hit a patch of ice, all of a sudden the van starts fishtailing. We're going back and forth, I'm like "Woah!" Krizz says...

[Krizz Kaliko]
"You got it Sean you got it! I think you got it man." But we went sliding further and further towards the barrier, BOOM we hit it. We flipped like 5 times, all the windows start breaking out in the van. I'm like "Oh god, oh god!" while we flipping, and finally we stop. I'm looking around the van to see if everybody is alright. First person I looked at was Big Nick cause I see him jumping out first. He runs to the doors cause they crushed in and he starts grabbing trying to rip them open like. (Grunting noises.)

[Big Nick]
I yank the doors open and I'm yelling out "Tech! Tech! Are you alright man? Kutt! Kutt! Are you alright?" Kutt raises up and I see he's drenched from all the bottles of alcohol we had in the van from last night; and I say "Kutt man, are you cool?" and he says

[Kutt Calhoun]
"Yeah I'm cool man, I'm cool." So I'm wiping my face, I'm thinking I'm bleeding. I look at my hands, it ain't nothing but the liquor. So I look around, everybody up and moving. Tech's still on the floor and I'm like, "Tech! Tech, you alright?" He ain't saying nothing, I'm like "Aw man... Tech, you alright?!" He said something like "Kutt,"

[Tech N9ne]
"I'm fine man. I'm fine man, I'm fine, I'm fine. I asked him, I said uh, anything wrong with my face? Anything on my face?" And Kutt was like "Nah" So I'm like, I'm listening, and I touch my teeth and I see blood in my mouth, but I'm smiling cause I hear Krizz Kaliko saying "Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus," and it felt good to be in God's graces. The ambulance, the people that came, they said that we were all blessed. Ya know what I'm saying, to still be alive after flipping 5 times man, so ever since then, we been celebrating life baby. Kickin' it hard. Every day's a party baby[Hook]
Let me put you on my flip cam
Baby let me take a, Do the sexy dance up on the table
Let me put you on my flip cam
I'mma watch it later, curtains open, we can show the neighbors
Let me put you on my flip cam
40 for the paper, make you fall like a skyscraper
Let me put you on my flip cam
Got 'em doing tricks man, I got these bitches on my flip cam

[Krizz Kaliko]
Catch ya on my flip cam, like the way you switchin'
Donk is so big, to palm it, I need a big hand
The way it's handlin', like two midgets is wrestlin'
Oh I want you, you look better than the rest of them
They go hard and pose, like pros after the shows
In they cars, I get so low, nobody know
She's a big ol' country gal, she must be from Alabama
Shoot white girl at a butte Montana
They gigglin', fuckin' naked, how I'm supposed to take it
Gimme a couple seconds, and I'll show wreck it
Come up on outta that Komono
Let me share with ya, you can meet my son the bone-o
I'mma be posted, you gone be exhausted
I'mma play the oven, you can get that thing toasted
Baby I can't wait, got me straight like a kickstand
Fixin' to put ya on my flip cam

[Hook]

[Kutt Calhoun]
Lookin' gooder than a mixed plate, big boned, Mitch Bade
Finest I done seen inside of this state
Mistake me and let it go and I don't risk take
She's a bopper, I won't stop her from tryin' to get my dick ate
Some sexy little curves like she's Nicki Minaj
Her lip sinc massage, show her lips need applause
I'm fixing to dodge, follow me to the car
Now I'm fit to blow through her like its 16th of raw
She likes it on the bed, she likes it on the couch
And every single orifice when we christening the house
She told me "Let's get freaky", I said "What you talking bout?"
I probably gone regret it, though I pull the camera out
She jumped on my banana, she looked good up on the camera
I put that on my kids and my baby momma's nana
I tore it each and every way but loose, when I hit
And if you don't believe me, you can view it on the flip

[Hook]

[Mackzilla]
Oh I think she like me, Yeah! She likes me
Her girlfriend got a girlfriend, She got a wifey
I just want to group it, see I'm on my groupie kit
My asian and my white girl, both love chocolate
My latin and my red bone, love the way they get along
Sex faces every time that the cameras on
Mmmhmm (Down on your hands and knees)
(Makzilla, I'm ready for my close-up please)

[Tech N9ne]
Then I walk downstairs and I seen it
Two chicks that really, really need it
When it come to that penis, they be sucking on my nigga
So I'm thinking the camera be genius
So I got my flip cam
Then I played with the bootie and the other chick's tits man
I was unzipped fam, put it in, make a baby girl bang like quicksand
I was sinkin', sinkin', then my flip cam started blinkin'
So I said "Makzilla!
I need a mother fucking computer to charge this thing man."
What do you know one of the hoes had a spare
So my flip cam was throwed in the air
I'm so glad I got bold then I told this pair

[Hook][Intro: Kutt Calhoun]
To all the women with the big booties, this is for you
Now make your way up on the dance floor, and do what you do
If you a stripper on the dance pole I'll fuck with you too
Cuz it does something deep down to me when I see them
With a booty like Kim Kardashian

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
It's no wonder why niggas smashin
To cash in that cheque, finna peel off hundreds, love it with a passion
You flashin in that dress, wanna see whats under. If I could imagine
Its a vaster heap of ass like unga-bunga put it on my lap and get
A massive size erection, tell me can you feel that? Is it really real?
Don't want it to end but you gotta make your rounds but a lot of booty in it, that's enough to go around
But I want you and you need money, I won't fight girl take it from me
Cuz by the end of the night I'll have you in the motel six room going dummy
So pop and drop it for me, and I'll pull out my door key
And lock us in cuz ain't nobody leaving til the morning

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]x2
So go on flip it ova
Go on flip it ova
Go-go on flip it ova
Go on flip it ova
Flip it ova bitch, flip it ova bitch (flip it ova)
Give a nigga what he want and flip it ova bitch (go on flip it ova)
Flip it ova bitch, flip it ova bitch (flip it ova)
Give a nigga what he want and flip it ova bitch (go on flip it ova)

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Got a big donk like Melyssa Ford
That can come in handy like extension cords
What's it gonna take of me to plug it? She's gonna need some extra length for sure
To reach that destination where that Georgia Beach is waitin
For my dick to commit with her midsection for a co-ed confrontation
And I smell it like a dog in heat but the bitch tryin to play it off smooth
Bent over in front of me gyratin and rumblin that bubbly all on my peter like it's cool
So I ease in intestine, put the hard dick across her booty let her feel it just leave an impression
Hard breathin and sweatin but she buckled at the knees for a second bout to teach the little beezy a lesson
On one-on-one encounters, my "jimmy" and your "jasmine"
With a thrust like this, you're bound to have plenty of orgasms
Then I took her to my house uh, she kindly set it out for me
Dying to see what K-U-T-T was all about

[Hook - Kutt Calhoun]x2

[Interlude - Kutt Calhoun]
Oh come on man, are you serious? Damn, look at that..
With a body like you Nicki Minaj

[Verse 3 - Kutt Calhoun]
I'm all on it, no contestant. Let me dele- your -catessen
Just pour mail in her direction. I'mma show you what god loves
From the hair on your head to the pretty lips on your face
Down to the itty bitty waist where the kitty kitty waits on the real life pussy monster
To beat it like it ain't never been beaten or eaten before
Treated like it ain't ever been seated on penis before
Twist it and shake it and try to break it and ????
Yellin lord have mercy knowin she never met Jesus before
But I know her religion even know the church that she attends its
Missionary big butt church of redundant booties and you can bring some friends in
There's only one condition, if you wanna join don't be on bullshit
It's march on down that ??? pride and bend over that pulpit.

[Hook - Kutt Calhoun]x2[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Kutt go show how it feels
To be voided but listen
First I'll make you miss it
Like the senate was missin'
Patricia Hearst cause I been in it for a minute
Put minutes in till it hurt, not for minute will I let
You diminish my men at work
And I been hurting trying to fathom the burden
But grieved not I put in work, inside and out
I'm deserving a clean shot
You people nursing every NERD
You encourage to speak not
Or you'll get murdered, you ain't heard
How the industry seized Pac

[Verse 2: Greed]
Somebody help the fame hurtin'
I won't fall for the bullshit
So fuck y'all wit a hard dick
Drop jaws when we barge in ya turn bitch
In front of hard men most rappers are garbage
Mitch Bade are target how soon de forget that
Strange is the hardest wit a line up of artists
Do it regardless
It's all about where your heart is
You can start this but Strange gonna finish it
Menace rhyme spoken
In every line it presented in

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
To all you haters in power we say
(Fuck the industry, fuck the industry)
Jack yo plaques put 'em down on eBay
(Fuck the industry, fuck the industry)
And all you boogie ass chumps can't touch us
The industry is some punk motherfuckers
You tell 'em FTI when anybody ask you
Fuck the industry, they the enemy

[Verse 3: Snug Brim]
Fuck this industry man
I'll make it happen boy
With fat change this rap thing
Full of hoes and haters and hat gain
The CEO don't want no part to this do
Cause if you're fuckin' up against
My firm is squakin' at you mean carcass is through
The A.R. better stay in this car
Cause I'm parkin' it to
Don't hate Brim cause I'm talking the truth
My dogs is barking at you
So you better get your mind right
Deuce clique representation we in the lime light

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
This "Rage" is "Against the Machine"
Turn these pages and flip till they clean
And what remains is for Krizz to be seen
So I say "Fuck the Industry"
Cause the speech that you preach to do people
Is so evil so "fuck your ministry"
How they ever gon' say what we gon' say
How they ever gon' say what we gon' do
Here I come for the mon and I'm comin' with a gun
Now tell me what I will and I won't do
F - Fear 'em they blast hoes
T - Tear 'em a new asshole
I - Infect their mind wit this lyrical blindness

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Skatterman]
"Hey Skatterman, I heard you rollin' with Tech"
But I still ain't signed
Cuz I'm a problem for these record execs
How can they market
A young black political target?
Who done took coca leaves
Beacon soda and enlarged it
Into crack rocks selling crack rocks for a livin'
From the black top
Where we jack cops for a livin'
So fuck the industry and damn the beats
I ain't just in the street
I'm Skatterman, I am the streets, nigga

[Verse 6: Tech N9ne]
You got a smile glarin', cause you get it packed
I got yo gal starin', cause you minute mack
You go yo mouth swearing that yo hit is plack
You hatin' file-sharing cause your shit is wack
Sampled yo CD listened and it was cheesy
No cable box 4 your TV no label watch for your breezy
We ride feel the pain
From inside fuck yo fame cause it died
Said yo thang was about the game claimed
Then he banged but you lied
Bout yo artist but yo artist is the farthest
From the harest but you market
This bark at this bunk dirty carpet
Shit game is out smarted
Oops somebody farted bout to spark this shit
Niggas are retarded look what you've started
Cerami Mark is pissed
I'mma break it down for you clowns
In the industry chain
(Fuck perspective Warner Bros., Qwest and JCOR's name)
Strange, we independent and you suckas
Are the enemy you fuckin' up the industry
You busters will remember me

[Hook] (2X)[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Whoo, all my ladies all around the world
Get fresh and new dress
To get your man it's the fuck 'em girl
It's Friday night, just got paid
She's lookin' for a little bit of action captain to get saved

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
So you go straight to the mall and call your girlfriend up
Tell her you bought a fuck 'em dress
Nothing less-more-than-a thinner-sinner-Chris Dior fitter
You gotcha hair did or that there wig
Sho a fitter got your own sitter for that there kid
She's goin' out to find a thick stout to out her dig
That dress' fittin' catcher's mitten is out there big
She manicured and pedicured up and lookin' like you wanna
Your man's hittin' your phone up, say fuck 'em if you wanna
Lip gloss is on her blow that mirror a kiss and if your man
Got you stressin' put on your dress and don't listen and sing
I can't wait til I get there, step in the club lookin' player player
Grab your keys and beat it to the spot where you guess you'll
Find you a nigga buyin' a two for one special
Exceptional sexual healin' is what your cravin'
Your man pagin' you, but fuck how he's feelin'

[Hook] (2X)
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
It's your time to get out
No time for thinkin' of 'em

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Now this is a story, all about how
These chicks get tricked and don't know how
So I'd like to take a second and explain to them
How all this craziness evolves out of relationships, listen
He never used to hit you, he always used to treat you
With some respect and dignity, and now he wanna beat you
Six months done passed and he's changed
You never would have thought he'd be crazy and deranged, huh
Just the way he approached was so sweet
He let you know you was far away from a (Late night creep)
Mister telephone man when he what'nt with you
Bobby browny and Whitney, you found you a new edition
Right in the beginning it was grinings from the sit down
'Til he let you know that it was all on a bitch now
When, after you had you a baby, he wanna start
Arguing his excuse to start sipping the Remy Mar-
-Tin, darkening this relationship
Now every lady grab your bics if you relate to this
You need to get up out those drawers
And put on some lip gloss, throw on a thong
Now make your way to the closet and

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Feel like I was put here for the female species
Hella listening watching whispering offerings no feces
When the back is obese we double back and go deeply
In her life in her mind never hate but'll go extra time if need be
Easy for me to connect so peep me
In the club I take her some place we can talk discretely
You're creep free definitely that heats me
Your body's wop bobba lu bop so hot baby teach me
How to get up inside it ride it, chakras are now ignited
That's a beautiful smile, don't hide it
Getting Tech the N9ne excited
Stress free I bet she so Nestle
Wanna know how wicked the sex be don't test me
Drink your drink eat your cherry and tie the stem
This is your world mommy ain't said a damn thing about him

[Hook] (2X)[Intro]
Welcome to G-G-G-Gamer
The game were either you can be the player, or you can get played
Caution, if you do engage and you lose
This could result in severe heart trauma or distort your way of thinking
Play Safely, safely, safely

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I-I-I am a game-gamer
Play the part major heart breaker brain changer
Take her thoughts make her start they insane anger
Then they can march, hate can spark, names danger
You gotta be fine to get in my chamber
Untamed ain't no shame when I bang stranger
But that's a thousand point, one got it, but the thing drained her
And the game hanged her in the strain of a main claimed her
Now what you gon' do different? Wonder how well the picture went
The one I saw was Twitter sent, saw through mommy like Mr.Kent
Lookin like her kissers were whistling to get liquor bent
Or wishing for me to stick her in a position to dip I get her hint
A hundred points she gets cause we connected
Five hundred points for the number that tech direct texted
Bonus three hundred if she come over and get naked
But a stinky crevice took her to nothing, girl take the exit

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm a game, she the game
I'm a player, you not the same
Who to loose, who to blame
Don't hate the player, hate the game
I can be your super lover babe if you just let me in
Baby it ain't hard to play the game but maybe hard to win
It's a roller coaster ride come on as I give it a spin
Play it right you get an extra man baby

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Next player she say shes the best slayer
She love when her breasts bare
With hot candle wax, that's rare
Six hundred points when she say her and her girl is a sex pair
That'll get you an extra man now we gamin on that there

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Baby you doing good, stay on it picked up an extra man
The only way to use that bonus is if a sexy friend
Equally fine as you may join us to pass the test
To slam fingers in and then out on your own personal message can
Skype is so exciting and virtual when two tight women ignite
In a delightfulness of diking in about five minutes
You might just win it yet, but now your girl looking up tight with it
Lack of participation got your points steadily spiking
And if five hundred points is important
Then let your mind body and souls free
Keep your opponents from trying to score these
Mighty sluttin' up with just seconds left on the board 3-
2-1 and on to the next ones cause these bore me
Because

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Eleven Hundred points mommy looked smelled and taste good
But lost it from telling it all on Facebook
One got a dinner, the other from Twitter was using a fake picture
And in the end weren't none of them winners
'Til I met this girl from Tagged.com
Got to meet me, whip me, and she be freaky deaky
Got the dinner, a movie and plus a repeat
Highest score ever, but I broke the broad
Say you came close but no cigar my minds primed

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Gaming on ya, even if you got some good head
Hood said you keep the pood fed 'til the woods dead
If you happen to get into bed with me
Then you'll spread quickly and do a medley of ooh and yeahs
With me, and that's a thousand points if you get that
Dinner is a thousand mo you can get it if you with that
Good conversation can probably get you diamond knickknacks
But a misshap like bloggin' about how I did that, give my shit back

[Hook]

[Outro]
Thank you for playing Gamer
Congrats if you are the winner
Sorry and shit if you are a loser
If indeed you failed
Please come again
But remember
Continuous play may cause extreme nausea
And often results can be fatal
-Game Over-[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Huh, yo, it don't start until I get there, show 'em how to Gangsta Shap
Cause where I'm from, that's where all the gangstas at
And when we come, yo we get to acting a ass
And we go (Dumb) if we get to moving too fast
See we go stuie-ooowee, rep from the Bay, all the way
To Missouri-ouri, back it up on me mama
Look what you do to me-ooowee
We do it raw dawg, off caribou louy-ooowee
Or that super dooey-ooowee Cheers!
One or two beers and you shap, it's like
Lean and rock with it, only you don't lean and snap, you like
"Left side, right side, hands about, chest high"
Then you wink at shorty in the corner with the left eye
(How you doing?) I'm off a little somethin' leanin'
Weed got me nervous, got a lil' trouble breathin' (Breathin')
Me and my heathen's is about to turn this mother out
Dip in the whip, burn rubber out Gangsta Shap

[Hook] (8X)
Gang-Gang-Gangsta Shap

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Wait a minute, hold up
There's too many chiefs and not enough soldiers
For the world wars, standin' on the front line
Tighten my toga I'm a Greek God
Blood affiliated, Deuce Klik Street Mob
Man I put this souly on my dookie brown dickeys
Hail to the B side
Can't Aptivate these Killa City killings
Nigga you can't calculate big clips long
Inner City menaces, these kids get it (On)
We don't fight no more, all we do is this
All we do is this, lately it's been through a bitch
And that's cost for livin' in, the center of Killa City
Where these niggas Willy Wonk and choppin' any men
Who feeling they really raw, get to pullin' dogs
At the dark demonians, nobody for you to call
When they do this all just a harsh remembrance
You might have got through it all but was too involved
And it's very scary, it's kind of pathetic
Nobody is sympathetic, when you dead and buried
We rugged and rigid no pun is intended
And when them thangs go clap
We gangstas man, we bring the trap
Remember killas don't dance man
We G-G-G-Gang-G-G-G

[Hook] (8X)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I re-member my school days, when I was a dancer
Back when LL Cool J was walking with a panther
Actually dancing was not, but rap was the answer
But with the shap, it's cool for the gangsta to dance to
Still here we stand with this dance that spread like a cancer
Cool for the man, even the woman with the baby in pampers
Dancin' is deep and it's dirty like the crevice of your hamper
Raisin' your hands up high in this bitch cause you amped up (Go!)
Nike, Air Jordan at the bottom in the middle was a Nautica pair
Lot of erotica there, but up top I got the gangsta black
Doin' the Gangsta Shap, nigga thanks for that Imperial nigga
You don't want to see me go speedy, bro need to see me flow
Never get this choppin' up out of me, he better see the dough
We be so cold with it, boy we need some wool mittens
Ladies just roll with it, everything is cool, kitten
Tilt your head like you got some screws missin'
But have that look on your face Like when you say you bullshittin'
Gangsta Shap
