Stayin down with the cattle
I shake, then I rattle
I might just come through
It's all about that grain
Might be all what on ya lesson
Teachin I might be stressin
I gots to come through to
Young G's I be stressin
17, Promethazine, creases in my jean
Pimpin', 6 screens
I'm comin through wreckin mic
Toting the weed I'm showin dope fiends
I ain't got time for pointing no red dot
I'm just bustin'
I ain't got time for no caps
I ain't sipping no Robitussin
We sipping that barre
TV/VCR, we renting that car no destination
We come thru on incarceration
I'm fresh off playing Playstation
In the what hoo-doo
I ain't sellin' no Zulu
I might just pop trunk now these
Hoes they doin' Voodoo
They wanna try to stick me
The foes want for 60
I'm might just come back
With Poyo instead of 50
Key-C is gonna shine
That boy Shaun reclined
I hit the Long Drive now it's time I do mine
It's time I just chill and lay back and sip a 8
I'm sittin' sideway
TV on tha scrape plate
They don't hate when they see
We coming, we don't fuss
We don't even cuss
We swanga's on the bus: Damn![Hook]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bring me some haze

[Intro]
Swisha House, Big Pokey and Paul Wall, baby

[Verse 1]
It's the People's Champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppa Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Hoes that diss me in the club, the same hoes in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T. Farris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm with that Gu U on 5-9-double-O
In the Tahoe on 24's I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Coota Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say "cheese" and show my fronts, it's more karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gangbangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Tryna find some Honey Love, my macking game is top rank
These hoes peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, tryna figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Pokey]
Maybe O'Jays, hoes be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's, watch ya ho
Bunch of money, bunch of clothes, Cigarillos, Optimos
Glidin' like a ice skater, motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sensei, Don 'Ke, Paul Wall in the place
Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Raised on Scott in the Yella
When I blaze, boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking off intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the plate
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm...

[Hook][Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city thats slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rolling up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hiding
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab riding

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking
Coming down the slab line the fo's crip walking
Together we stand, divided we fall, yeah
North and the south together we ball
Fuck that, nigga its a H-Town thang
Lemme see ya touch the sky if ya feeling me mayne
Its Boss Hogg Corleone, nigga that Mike D
The drank man daddy, you know where to find me

[Verse 10: Big Pokey]
State to state dawg, I got em jockin the kid
6' backin out the driveway, dropping the wig
Yall know we do it big, like a freightliner rig
Got stashes full of cash where I keep the money hid
Fresh to death homie, how I came in the do'
Prada shades on, smelling like a swanger of dro
Put'cha H'es up, represent'cha city bro
Counting money, iced out, like I'm in a video

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Rob G]
(Talking) Southwest put'cha dubs up baby, let's go!
Now welcome to the place I love, place I was raised to be a G
It's straight hang with thugs, jam my music slow and hold my H's up
Southwest SWAT I know the real dudes that move birdies
I go to school early, baby blue Moon jersey
Riding around, southwest side of my towm
Still Reppin' My Block, How Ya Likin Me Now
Its from Sharpstown, Braeswood to Alief
Black and Latins stacking paper together we stay deep
It's Rob G!

[Verse 12: Trae]
Cheyah!
King of the Streets and I'm roll around Houston ridin 4's
Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)
I'm so hood it be the true definition of me
Ain't no way speak about the H, without mentioning me
Tha Truth, nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Lil O]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay I'm from H-Town, southwest stop drop and roll
If I chunk the dub up, the whole hood rock n roll
Braaeswood, Woolfair, Clull Creek, Spice Lane
West Bellville, Fondren Airport, Sandpiper, stack change
I'm so H-Town there's codeine in my blood
And I done shout it out at war with with the meanest of thugs
And you ain't never gotta ask if there's lean in my cup
I'm a triple O.G., S.U.C. nigga what
Its Lil O Homie

[Verse 14: Pimp C]
Now I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, 90 miles away
For the last 15 years, I been reppin my state
I knew the real DJ Screw sip grape by the case
Eight's over ice straight product of the H
Southside, I never was no big socializer
With Bun you can talk, I fuck with the boss
Like Thug and Prince Silvia Rome or Wrice
This game a pie I dont want it all I just need a slice

The nights are restless
All my ex's live in the best little whore house in Texas
The devil's ridin dirty from Georgia to Tooasis
I'm not Garth Brooks but I got friends in low places
Howlin South is 1
Packin gats and stackin 1's
Gotta know when to walk away
And know when to run

[Hook: Joe Slaughter]
The Dirty South is what it's about

Watch me shred this track like a Texas chainsaw
Use adjectives and nouns

And all the drugs I intake courtesy of Towdown
Whoa now!

White cup in my hand
Philly blunt in my mouth
Bout to turn this party out

Mr. ballin parlay
And smoke my life away
H-Town superstar
Sippin soda mixed with barre
Thought you never hear my lyrics over a bass guitar
My horses are cars
With a V 12 motor
And my wagon is a 4.6 Range Rover
The game is over
Settin them trends

[H.A.W.K.]
One puff two puffs, I'm hooked like handcuffs
A thrush and a head rush, says that I've had enough
I'm sprung hear it comes, down a pathway through my lungs
A cloud of cluddered smoke, blends with my oxygen
The one human being, can't give me this satisfaction
Your centrifugal force, causes a chain reaction
The strategy you use, is addictive to many
One of you is not enough, I need five or twenty
I smoke plenty, menage tois with cigars
Wrapping weed like cigars, puts my mind on bars
Cut it down the middle, split it like the Red Sea
Show love filled with buds, fresh off the ganja tree
I'm on optimoes, force feeding you these flows
The aroma of marijuana, hits like Tyson blows
Boat loads of do-do, I'm in Akapoko
Tooty and fool coo-coo, but I'm going loco I'm blowed

[Hook: Breeze]
Just roll up a blunt, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, 24/7 3-65
Roll up a blunt yeah, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, just to keep you satisfied

[Big Pokey]
Dump me in and close the do', let's take some pressure off ya brain
We three deep up on this thang, me and you and Mary Jane
From a bud to a grain, propane to a flame
Inhaling this octane, getting wet from all this rain
Everything is everything, I'm a certified choker
Light green smoker, put the heat to the ocra
Drop the three in the Fruitopia, we on cruise control
Or take 'em straight to the dome, cause it sooths the soul
I'm a puff-puff passer, doja square crasher
Getting my high to the sky, like a rocket out of NASA
Like players with asthma, bronchitis and ecetra
As for me I'm a tree, till you see red in my retna
Gone off Long and-a, this fire I'm loving
Massive puffing, chiefing smoking like a broke oven
Plus this sack I'm juggling, got us high as a kite
Cigarella's full of flight, what a hell of a night it's going down

[Hook]

(*singing*)

[H.A.W.K.]
Everything's splendid, the weed is heavenly scented
Puff-puff pass, is highly recommended
Till massage the brain, relieve migranes
And keep Sensei calm, when he's off the chain
You must maintain, and try to keep your composure
Whether hydro or cess, or some potent doja
Let me expose ya, to the pride of the front
Empty out the cigars, and just roll up a blunt roll it

[Hook]

(*singing*)(*talking*)
Cut the mic up, cut the mic up now
This for them G's out there, Lil' J-Face
Rap-A-Lot, feel this yeah

[Hook - 2X]
Power in the flower, power in the flower
All I ever wanted, was the power in the flower

[Big Pokey]
All I ever wanted, was the power in the flower
Moving a hundred miles per hour, nigga I'ma
Do my thang, make it come back like a boomerang
Arm & Hammer cocaine, a bunch of pocket change
One thang about this game, it's addictive
A lot of pro's and con's, hoes and guns nigga it's wicked
I ride dirty like Bun B and Pimp, I ain't parking my car
Got three microwaves, working with my fork in the jar
Stay splurging, digging in it like a surgeon
Then I feed it to 'em raw, pure as a virgin
When you fucking with me, you fucking with the best
Ounces hard, as a Japanese math test
We make a dopehouse, jump like a '64
Pitch the snow, if the laws happen to kick in the do'
Get your calico, in case it's a false alarm
If you get caught slipping, it's on

[Hook - 2X]

[Big Pokey]
I'm a heavy weighter, when I rain I shower
In the kitchen and I'm mixing, flipping figgas and flour
Got this flower flipping, plus I'm making moves power ticking
A bunch of money, got a young nigga power tripping
Fucking these hoes, these niggas baby mamas sucking my pole
Focused man, stay in control
It'll take you fast, let you make some cash
Flip the script on you, break your ass
Have your game mask on, when you hit the flo'
Put your 4-4 in your pocket, 'fore you hit the do'
It's a game where money talk, violence control
Rule number one, silence is gold
Once you get your connect, then you get your change on
Then you get your respect, then you got your fame on
Cats'll get caught up, and get they aim on
That's what can happen to ya, when you get your name known

[Hook - 4X]

[Big Pokey]
You doing great now, your name packing weight now
High self-esteem, got you feeling like a eight now
You living in the states, with lakes
Electric gates, surveillance if they break in your place
You feeling, the other side of the game
It's gravy now, cause money ain't a thang
You got these hoes, you lining 'em up
The ones you really cut for, diamond 'em up
Your main ho buy her a truck, it's the vida loca
If she steal from you, beat her and choke her
You don't make deals with smokers, you done graduated
Watch your back, cause them broke niggas agitated
I ain't exaturating, that's how the game go
To the top of the ladder, that's what you aim fo'
Keep your name low, and get your money on
Cause if you crap out, money gone

[Hook - 4X][Hook - 2x]
I'll have you draped in the fina thangs, sporting diamond rings
Fill your bracelet with karats, and give you pocket change
I ain't a trick, but I wanna get with ya
When I dream you the one that I picture, I'm all in

[Big Pokey]
Know, what a nigga really love to see
Gucci sheets we in a suite, you making love to me
Hugging me rubbing me, mugging me
Pulling out and releasing on the belly, cause that's the thug in me
I love to freak, you make a nigga geek for sex
I'mma floss the six, you could floss the Lex
I'mma ice out necks, I'm all in
In the mist of me balling, I hear your body calling
I'm bout it, baby you bout it
I'm on the yacht at the bar getting sloppy, holding you is a hobby
Of mine, as we bump and we grind
Digging in you from behind, irritating your spine
It ain't a fuck thang, or a Viper and a truck thang
When you in the kitchen, frying up a duck mayn
I love the thangs you do, I love to hang with you
I'm putting it on the line boo, I'm claiming you

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
Off the top I'm a mess, cause the thug and finesse
These baguettes on my chest, got you highly impressed
Blowing pounds of cess, maybe ki's and acres
In the waters of Jamaica, is where I normally take ya
Casinos in Vegas, see I ball's and ball's
600 U-Haul, fish tank in the wall
Going hard in the mall, ooh the show ain't stopping
V-12 steady chopping, and my screens is dropping
It was love at first sight, I knew that when I met ya
Shoes skates and if you slip, Persian rug gon catch ya
Candles lit around the tub, while we taking a bath
Shoulders pinned against the marble, while I'm up in the mad
Bath water with bubbles, hugged up like huddles
And we caress and we cuddle, ain't worries or trouble
Sweat pouring in puddles, cause I'm all in them hips
Ain't no chains or no whips, cause the script done flipped it be a trip

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
Baby, I'm back in your brain
Watch the screens when it rain, peep the piece and the chain
Diamond white fo' runner, real leather and lumber
Buttons chopping like pirhanna, holding head in my sauna
Plus the four course meal, put the berries on chill
Lose the skirt you dessert, the way you work it be real
You ain't a freak boo, you make a nigga knees weak boo
Brown skin smelling sweet, and petite too
That's why I'm making you mine, locking you down
Knocking you down, when it jump off I'm cocking the nine
Mili', you my tests is a pillow
Gon have to grind or put it down, cause I stack's up the scrilla
Dope dealing and cap peeling, are some things of the past
Now C.E.O. hogging the show, and smashing the gas
Built to last in this game, plus I'm in it to win
Just remember like I said befo', I'm all in

[Hook - 2x]

When I dream, you the one that I picture, I'm all in - 8x(*talking*)
These niggas gon bleed, pass me the weed
These niggas gon bleed

[Hook: Big Pokey]
These niggas gon bleed, I just hit em with that thang and it freeze
Good that I did my deed, so pass me the weed
So I could slay, another MC
These niggas, ain't fucking with me

[Lil' O]
I represent the born in killers, from the land of the trillest
Drug dealers thug niggas, who specialize in kidnapping squealers
Gat concealers, drillers for scrilla through outfed gorillas
We bust back with bazookas, just to make sure they feel us
Like Attila the Hun, killers with guns leaving you numb
Loving nothing, but bitches and funds
Give me your ones, for fun you'll get annihilated
Pull the nickle fine plated, both his eyes dilated
Yeah the Southside made it, how you love that
I know you niggas hate it, but you can't fuck with that
Lil' O, better known as Fat Rat with the cheese
Triggas squeeze, on all the South's enemies with ease

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
I hit your block like Jeffrey Dommer, eat a nigga ass up
And what click you claim, I could give a fat fuck
You touch my fast bucks, I'm at your front do'
Quicker than a fast nut, with that blast and that buck
Rob-rob murder-murder, killer cap peeler
Slug feeler hit list, dump a nigga in the ditch hit
You bitches it's bidness, you know I'm saying
So when you see me out the roof, cause you know what I'm spraying
And you know where I'm aiming, I proceed at your toes
And I make my foes fall, like wars at Jericho
Get greedy with calicoes, jaw breakers and body blows
Flying feet to the nose, multiple bullet holes
Like a heroin overdose, or too much cocaine in your nose
I got that heart stopper flow, the chart topper glow
So start with Lil' O, best believe I draw heat
A monster mind shit, bitch it's all about me

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
Ain't no discussing, we issue concussions for nothing
Redrumming like Russians, hitting boys like percussion for thinking that we bluffing
Cause it ain't nothing, to get these triggas crushing
Niggas rushing for they shit, but it's too late they got hit
Try the Glock greeders, certified block bleeders
Heavyweights from Texas state, smuggle top flight cheeba
In the drop top beamer, with a top notch diva
Thugged out diamonds shining, with my hand on my heater
These niggas act like senoritas, so I slap them all
And I know it breaks your heart, that I'm back to ball
But the fact of it all, is that I still won't stop
From this day forth, the rap game is now locked[DJ Screw talking]

Wanted dead red posters all ova the city I been robbin
Ain't no decidin when I'm ridin

Southside strangler rangler
Draw arm and stranger
The days are hot and long
The nights are restless
All my ex's live in the best little whore house in Texas
The devil's ridin dirty from Georgia to Tooasis
I'm not Garth Brooks but I got friends in low places
Howlin South is 1
Packin gats and stackin 1's
Gotta know when to walk away
And know when to run

[Hook: Joe Slaughter]
The Dirty South is what it's about
Poin up smokin out
Keepin it hot like the middle of June

And border outlaw
Watch me shred this track like a Texas chainsaw
Use adjectives and nouns
Sippin drank blowin punds
And all the drugs I intake courtesy of Towdown
Whoa now!

White cup in my hand
Philly blunt in my mouth
Bout to turn this party out
It's the H-A-W-K
Mr. ballin parlay
And smoke my life away
H-Town superstar
Sippin soda mixed with barre
Thought you never hear my lyrics over a bass guitar
My horses are cars
With a V 12 motor
And my wagon is a 4.6 Range Rover
The game is over
Settin them trends
Now this country western rap is officially in

Cold as a ice berg mouth full of gold
Rap game John Wayne

Yeah, doing my thang though, know I'm saying
S.U.C. in here, yeah aiight what

[Big Pokey]
Say me, I'm just doing my thang though
Crocks on, wife beater linen looking good in my Kango
4-5 on the hip, you know how this game go
The outside's jelly, but the inside's mango
Don't watch me watch your weight, if you hate
I got enough ammo, to body rock the state
Don't worry bout me mayn, I got that covered
And the block is like pork chops, I got that smothered
When my kush is tasting like, and these bricks I run
But what you can do, is stay up out my mix that come
Crock bull count cash, on the regular homie
Even when I'm hitting corners, on the cellular homie
Get your mind off me, and get it on your money
Cause I'mma ball and parlay, when it's grey or sunny
I'm the real deal, you niggas funny bunny
Fake ass niggas 'feit, like they funny money

[Hook - 2x]
(don't worry bout mine, worry bout yours - [4x])
I'm not worried about you, I'm not worried I'm not worried
I'm just worried about me, I'm just worried about myself

[Z-Ro]
Too many problems, on my mind
Living shife, is starting to be a full time grind
I'm just trying, to live my life
And when I die, I hope I see Jesus Christ
Fuck people, cause all these people don't treat me right
They say they love me, but they shoot me right between my eyes
Bitch if you ain't screwed up, lace your shoes up
We stationary, like a statue that you can't move up
I'm 87-32, better known as a Hoover
Mind your bidness my nigga, I'll run my fist all the way through ya
Fuck around and kill one of these nosey ass niggas and bitches if they make
Cause they can smell it in Sunnyside, when I pass gas in Katy
Ya'll ain't write none of my songs, so why in the fuck is ya'll on stage with me
And when I get a retrial and start back blazing, ya'll can't blaze with me
They on the dick of Joseph McVey, so focused on me
They can't do what they need to do, for them through they day and it's fucked up

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I never had love for a bitch, I'm about my money
Too many years, I done paid the price
You must be smoking, if you think I'mma make you my wife
And I never had love for a nigga, I'm about my money
Even if they murder me, I ain't going nowhere
Turn up the volume to the radio, I'll be right there
I'm not worried about yoooooou
I'm just worried about meeeeeee
I'm not worried about yoooooou
I'm just worried about meeeeeee, heeeey

[Hook - 2x]

Don't worry bout mine, worry bout yours - [8x](*talking*)
Say cuz, I'm off the chain mayn
And it go down for real, niggas can't see me
Know I'm talking bout, I'm ean that

[Big Pokey]
Take a trip with me, as I infiltrate your noggin
I'm to the point of mind bogglin, keep it throbbin
If you swing I'm bobbin, even if I'm dobbed out mobbin
On the dope corner, in my Jordans
Niggas is starvin, they need to get they game sharpened
Out there robbing, bound to get they days darkened
I keep my 4-4 barking, for them lames larking
And them bustas plotting on me, in the valet parking
Steady sparking, pounds of killa
Plus a young nigga grinds for scrilla, on the reala
I load eighteen wheelers, full of yayo
Dog proof for the smell, all about my mail
Only time will tell, the FED's on my trail
Plus you know, that a young nigga tilt the scale
A heavy weighter, billboard penetrator
Biting mics, I'm a rap game gladiator

[Hook - 2x]
The haaaardest, the hardest
(rule number one, always keep it reala)
(number two on my chest, a untamed guerilla)
Keeping it reala, the realest
(cap peeler, plus I bite mics for scrilla)
(take it from me who I be, hardest pit in the litter)

[Big Pokey]
I'm a thuggish nigga, on drank I'm sluggish
Mug mean infa' beam, and a brick in my luggage
Keep my game face on, when I'm punching the clock
From a rock to a block, my spot hot as a crock pot
Dome shot connector, red dot reflector
Fifty pound dissector, when I'm buying from Hector
Calls collector, plus a snitch detector
I.Q. like leopard, dope game perfecter
Mobstyle protector, sky street infector
I'm a platinum editor, CEO director
Chin checker, just a certified wrecker
Sweeping up sets, like a Black & Decker
I got Texas ways, it's simply cause I'm Texas raised
And handle all animosity, with techs and K's
Split toupees, I stain the brain
Everything gon remain the same, what's my name

[Hook]

[Big Pokey]
Peep the rules, if you snooze you lose
That's why I choose to strap my shoes, and pay my dues
Leave no clues, cause niggas is fools
Hearts colder than igloos, coolers full of ice
Teelee, 'fore you shoot the dice
Or catch that one way flight, to Paradise
It's nothing nice, if it ain't your time
Keep on if you think I'm lying, it go down
I stay on top of mine, my game
And stains niggas brains, like migraine
It ain't mine, if it ain't wide frame
(what if you off the chain), then you best to hide mayne
Spit verses for change, and bring the pain
Rap game John Wayne, (that's a god damn shame)
Infrared for aim, when I rain
This a nigga you can't contain, uncut cocaine, I'm raw

[Hook - 4x][Intro: Big Moe]
That nigga Big Ass Moe

[H.A.W.K.]
One puff two puffs, I'm hooked like handcuffs
A thrush and a head rush, says that I've had enough
I'm sprung hear it comes, down a pathway through my lungs
A cloud of cluddered smoke, blends with my oxygen
The one human being, can't give me this satisfaction
Your centrifugal force, causes a chain reaction
The strategy you use, is addictive to many
One of you is not enough, I need five or twenty
I smoke plenty, menage tois with cigars
Wrapping weed like cigars, puts my mind on bars
Cut it down the middle, split it like the Red Sea
Show love filled with buds, fresh off the ganja tree
I'm on optimoes, force feeding you these flows
The aroma of marijuana, hits like Tyson blows
Boat loads of do-do, I'm in Akapoko
Tooty and fool coo-coo, but I'm going loco I'm blowed

[Hook: Breeze]
Just roll up a blunt, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, 24/7 3-65
Roll up a blunt yeah, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, just to keep you satisfied

[Big Pokey]
Dump me in and close the do', let's take some pressure off ya brain
We three deep up on this thang, me and you and Mary Jane
From a bud to a grain, propane to a flame
Inhaling this octane, getting wet from all this rain
Everything is everything, I'm a certified choker
Light green smoker, put the heat to the ocra
Drop the three in the Fruitopia, we on cruise control
Or take 'em straight to the dome, cause it sooths the soul
I'm a puff-puff passer, doja square crasher
Getting my high to the sky, like a rocket out of NASA
Like players with asthma, bronchitis and ecetra
As for me I'm a tree, till you see red in my retna
Gone off Long and-a, this fire I'm loving
Massive puffing, chiefing smoking like a broke oven
Plus this sack I'm juggling, got us high as a kite
Cigarella's full of flight, what a hell of a night it's going down

[Hook]

(*singing*)

[H.A.W.K.]
Everything's splendid, the weed is heavenly scented
Puff-puff pass, is highly recommended
Till massage the brain, relieve migranes
And keep Sensei calm, when he's off the chain
You must maintain, and try to keep your composure
Whether hydro or cess, or some potent doja
Let me expose ya, to the pride of the front
Empty out the cigars, and just roll up a blunt roll it

[Hook]

(*singing*)[Hook]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bring me some haze

[Intro]
Swisha House, Big Pokey and Paul Wall, baby

[Verse 1]
It's the People's Champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppa Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Hoes that diss me in the club, the same hoes in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T. Farris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm with that Gu U on 5-9-double-O
In the Tahoe on 24's I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Coota Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say "cheese" and show my fronts, it's more karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gangbangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Tryna find some Honey Love, my macking game is top rank
These hoes peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, tryna figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Pokey]
Maybe O'Jays, hoes be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's, watch ya ho
Bunch of money, bunch of clothes, Cigarillos, Optimos
Glidin' like a ice skater, motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sensei, Don 'Ke, Paul Wall in the place
Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Raised on Scott in the Yella
When I blaze, boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking off intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the plate
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm...

[Hook]Let's do it!

[Hook] (4x)
Starched and cleaned
Poppin' out lookin' good
I still represent the same... neighborhood

[Verse 1 - Lil' Flip]
Aye... the whole world like "Flip where the fuck you been?"
On vacation, ridin' in my Maybach Benz (yeaahh)
I'm swangin' left and right like I ain't got no license
The nine on my hip I call it "Iron" Mike Tyson
And you already know what we mix our Sprites in (sizzurp)
Yellow gold that's where we dip our ice in (bling!)
Your hoes that's where we stick our pipes in
Homie I'm freeestylin', I'm not writin'
Man I be reppin' Texas way harder than y'all (harder than y'all)
I'm a millionaire dawg, I'm way smarter than y'all (smart than y'all)

A DJ Screw shirt in the v-suits with cream, you know I'm

[Hook] (4x)

[Verse 2 - Lil' Flip]
Big Pokey, he from Yellow Stone
I be rollin' hella chrome
Clover watch with yellow stones (I'm shinin'!)
Cook the work then get it gone
Break it down to all zones and don't be talkin' on your phone (hello... cause we grindin'!)
See I be gettin' cash now, my 84's glass now
Ya be ridin' on 3's, you ain't like them Clover G's
I got a ticket at the light cause my rims ain't stop (stop!)
And I hope he don't smell all this smoke comin' out
You know the Clover G's first, then Sqad-Up next (next)
So all my enemies you better guard ya chest (yep!)
Cause everyday I'm fly now, yeah my paper high now
And I represent the Screwed Up Click until I die ha!

[Hook] (4x)

[Verse 3 - Big Pokey]
I'm a H-Town nigga (Tex)
Stay down nigga
Parkin' out at the club, at the playground nigga (aye)
I don't lay down nigga (why?)
I lay niggas down (how many?)
I rock Sean John lining, and I don't play around
I push mo' teeth than the motiff
I get my grind on homie
Everything starched down, like I gotta get my eye on (pop my collar)
And I still represent the same neighborhood (what's that?)
Yellow Stone with my yellow stones against the wood (aye)
I'm a hood nigga, tight white, white ones
Bad bitches get head pinned
I'mma go pull out the right ones
I shine like diamonds, swangin' wide with the roof back
Cushion the amp with the roof cracked
Dawg is hot, I'mma loot that

[Verse 4 - Lil' Keke]
Ayyyyeee....
I'm poppin' out and lookin 'good fresh out that wood grain
Recline the buck and hold the cup befo' I switch lane
I'm in that brain stain, where seven disc change
It's in the wind, but spinnin' rims when the speed gain (gain)
Oh yeah this Ke man, plus I stay starched and cleaned
I'm poppin' doors and pullin' hoes befo' I flee the scene
They catch us steppin' out with foreign doors and plenty slab
It's Don Ke and young Flippa, niggas do the math
The doors suicide (cide), the brains blowin' out (blowin' out)
It's chrome strutzin', buttergutcha, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
It's S.U.C., Screwston, Texas so we slowed down
You sip you drank and get you bank, this is H-Town

[Hook] (5x)[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city thats slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rolling up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hiding
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab riding

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking
Coming down the slab line the fo's crip walking
Together we stand, divided we fall, yeah
North and the south together we ball
Fuck that, nigga its a H-Town thang
Lemme see ya touch the sky if ya feeling me mayne
Its Boss Hogg Corleone, nigga that Mike D
The drank man daddy, you know where to find me

[Verse 10: Big Pokey]
State to state dawg, I got em jockin the kid
6' backin out the driveway, dropping the wig
Yall know we do it big, like a freightliner rig
Got stashes full of cash where I keep the money hid
Fresh to death homie, how I came in the do'
Prada shades on, smelling like a swanger of dro
Put'cha H'es up, represent'cha city bro
Counting money, iced out, like I'm in a video

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Rob G]
(Talking) Southwest put'cha dubs up baby, let's go!
Now welcome to the place I love, place I was raised to be a G
It's straight hang with thugs, jam my music slow and hold my H's up
Southwest SWAT I know the real dudes that move birdies
I go to school early, baby blue Moon jersey
Riding around, southwest side of my towm
Still Reppin' My Block, How Ya Likin Me Now
Its from Sharpstown, Braeswood to Alief
Black and Latins stacking paper together we stay deep
It's Rob G!

[Verse 12: Trae]
Cheyah!
King of the Streets and I'm roll around Houston ridin 4's
Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)
I'm so hood it be the true definition of me
Ain't no way speak about the H, without mentioning me
Tha Truth, nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Lil O]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay I'm from H-Town, southwest stop drop and roll
If I chunk the dub up, the whole hood rock n roll
Braaeswood, Woolfair, Clull Creek, Spice Lane
West Bellville, Fondren Airport, Sandpiper, stack change
I'm so H-Town there's codeine in my blood
And I done shout it out at war with with the meanest of thugs
And you ain't never gotta ask if there's lean in my cup
I'm a triple O.G., S.U.C. nigga what
Its Lil O Homie

[Verse 14: Pimp C]
Now I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, 90 miles away
For the last 15 years, I been reppin my state
I knew the real DJ Screw sip grape by the case
Eight's over ice straight product of the H
Southside, I never was no big socializer
With Bun you can talk, I fuck with the boss

This game a pie I dont want it all I just need a slice

Southside Don Ke, Sensei
Starched down, and I'm rolling on 84's
Get your hood up, Herschelwood-Y.S.P
Southside, feel this

[Lil' Keke]
Starched down so clean, crease still in my jeans
Drank purple candy red, money and the dro green
Sideways, turn crooked in my ride
I'ma wipe the Lac down, it's Saturday night live
Trunk open boppers scoping, everything's good
Dro burning 4's turning, welcome to the hood
Supersonic mean green, like I'm Shawn Kemp
I'm far from a mark, but I'm some'ing like a pimp
I pull out on a hot day, Cadillac or Chevrolet
Butter seats black heat, wish a nigga would play
I'm 22's, Emmit Smith's like a big boss
My neck froze, 84's like I'm Randy Moss
I pay the cost, cause them Texas boys they ride slab
We Southside till we die, can I get some dap
It's C.M.G., S.U.C. cause it's all the same
I hit 'em hard and wreck a broad, when I'm on them thangs

[Hook - 4x]
Starched down, and I'm rolling on 84's

[Big Pokey]
Starched down, rolling on them 84's gripping wood
Swanging wide, representing Southside looking good
Turning corners in the hood, sitting on insane glass
And I got a pocket full of, do the damn thang cash
I'ma mash for my dreams, ass on the Palamene
Infra beam on the seat, hauling when I hit the scene
'64 hardtop, six tre hill green
Starched down, rolling on them Randy Moss looking clean
I'm the dude with the roof back, burning the rubber
Put a blanket on my flame, and I'm burning the cover
4-5 in the glove spot, nigga we covered
Put the wife and kids to bed, we looking for supper
I live in the struggle, got pigeons to juggle
These G colored stones, make your vision double
Sensei sick with the hustle, sick with the grind
And I'm sitting low to the flo', ridiculous shine yeah

[Hook - 4x]

[Lil' Keke]
The Don and Sensei, we mobbing the highway
The wood grain is tilted, we sitting on soft grey
4's and two prone, so mirror is so glass
The Benz sitting on his ass, with a European mask
40 supreme gas, a dream of getting cash
The Vette' do 200, you can see it on the dash
The king in the building, bitches give me the crown
84's and low pros, I'll still be starched down

[Big Pokey]
84's turning, and it's time to get our shine on
On the grind, a whole bunch of money what my mind on
I switch time zones, nigga I'm a mob boss
Vogue tire peeling off, some'ing with the ceiling off
Three wheeling off, beating like a masturbator
Deuce out the roof, when you see us passing by the haters
We got the Lexus, T-Rex's and the Navigators
Rims up on the crawl, like a alligator

[Hook - 7x][Hook: Toya]
Ain't no killers, like the ones I've got
(no one can rush y'all better)
Red light beaming, have you scheming a lot
(M.O.B., get the cheddar)
Boys pop noise, till you show em the chrome
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
All them haters, catching shots to the dome
(shots to the dome, shots to the dome)

[Kyleon]
I got a chopper named Glenda, that cut up niggas like blenders
I put in work on contenders, and to your maker I send ya
I push you up but I spin ya, and put AK bullets in ya
You bring a knife to a gun fight, with a cake click to defend ya
I make em fall like September, have fucked off family members
I bring heat to the beef, now a Paramedic gon tend to ya
Eating out a straw, and IV's going in ya
And a closed casket and tombstone, is the way they remember ya
My brothers'll smother ya, let the coroners cover ya
Reach out and we touching ya, now we bled and busting ya
Wig twisted and touching ya, AK bullets is busting ya
It's a must that ya, think twice before you come fuck with us
Who survived we slam, six feet under our land
Put him to sleep with a piece, while you run from him and damn
I create mayhem like bonfires, at Texas A&M
Leave him breathless and chestless, the AK sprayed him
Do away with him, and ain't no doctor saving him
Let him rest stop shots to him chest, the flat line's paging him

[Hook]

[Grimm Reaper]
I could give it to ya raw, and punchline it out
Squeeze one off in ya mouth, and see what ya talking bout
Share ya thoughts nigga, all on the wall
M.O.B. Style shit, and I swear I only live around
Shooting shit, that'll wake up the block
I gotta keep a mean heater, cause you know I'm trying to take up the block
I'm a Yellowstone nigga, with the new J's on
Sixteen shots nigga, with a beam on my chrome
Bitch niggas, better leave us alone
Cop killers penetrate ya vest fool, and then break up the bone
And this lovely knife work with the shank, I got the chest
This feather-weight Tre-8, will take care of the rest
Penetrating, different blocks and sets
Moving rocks and zones, a nigga gotta keep a Glock or a tech
Give a fuck about icing my neck, I only care about my life and respect
Mobstyle know I rep's my set, I rep's my set-I rep's my set nigga

[Hook]

[Big Pokey]
Two clips with 17, that's 34 shots
Call all the Paramedics, we gon need 34 cops
It's 34 pits, 34 rots
That's 68 dogs, but only 34 locks
I keep my 4-4 cocked, one in the head
Pistol grip nice sights, trigga under the red
One move and ya dead, hit in the head numb in the legs
C-4 for damage baby, it's a bomb in ya bed
I hope it's another nigga with em, who wan' pump up lead
Be ain't gon get the AK, he ain't come with the bread
You know how we play it, silent and violent
You know what we did, cause them sirens is hollering
Before you disrespect it, pump ya breaks
When my pits jump the gate, chumps get ate
Don't make me confiscate, your life lil' daddy
I'll have you soul hunting your wife, lil' daddy M.O.B. you know me

[Hook][Hook - 2X]
It ain't, no love
I ain't got time, to be messing with these scrubs
I'm too busy in these streets, coming up
Niggas wanna see you off your game fucked up, that's for real

[Mr. 3-2]
Pimp Chris, pimp-a-docious
My game ferocious, fly like a bird or a locust
Focused on getting it, all day long
I'm a million dollar nigga, and these streets got me wrong
Now who that man, who that talking down
On Showtyme, and the big Boss of H-Town
Screwed Up underground, connected with new timers
Niggas get dealt with, I'm squashing all drama
Call your mama, or your back up plan
Get slapped up man, fucking with a grown ass man
I never ran, I pull heat and start busting
Niggas talk a good game, but don't want nothing
Some'ing gotta give, in this YK3
It's either rap or sell dope, for the G-O-V
Southside of the tree, and I'm throwing up the dub
Get your money while you can, cause it ain't no love

[Hook - 2X]

[Big Pokey]
Ain't no love dog, love don't love nobody
When I dap niggas up, I don't hug nobody
I'm bout my cash flow, that's all a nigga mash fo'
Give me what's mine, is all a nigga ask fo'
Don't get your ass to', fucking with this hard nose
Ass nigga, with these hard hands boys know
I ain't no wanksta, I'ma hit the lot and cop some'ing
I'm a gangsta, I'ma get the Glock and drop some'ing
Stop bumping, be about your mail
Get paid, everytime you pull out your scale
Before I tuck my tail, I'll die on the field
Spend the rest of mine, in a eight-by-ten trying to kill
Bitch niggas squeal, real niggas ride
You steady talking loud, nigga kill or stay quiet
Pressure bust a pipe, but I ain't gon budge
Fuck the hype cause it ain't no love, for real

[Hook - 2X]

[Chris Ward]
With so much drama, in the Y.S.P
It's kinda hard, being C-W-A-R-D
But I, somehow some way
Keep coming up with funky ass shit, like every single day
With mo' flows, than the average
I'm on my toes with mo' clothes and mo' hoes, and it shows I ain't your average
If I see it, I just grab it
That's if I want it or I need it, or I just got that feel I gotta have it
Good pussy, I'ma stab it
Hop up in it hop up on it, hop all around it just like a rabbit
It's really, a bad habit
If you from H-Town you cop it drop it, you swang it and you slab it
Ooh-wee dag nabbit, I'm too fresh with my playerness
Some say I got, what the rest of these playas missed
That's why, I fuck the women that they wanna fuck
Or at least fuck the ones, that tell 'em they don't wanna fuck cause

[Hook - 2X](*talking*)
Uh, auto-matic Mob music
Mobstyling, feel that network auto

Hard on the weed, hard on the drank

[Hook - 4x]

So how can it be, who can it be

[Young Cay]
Automatic, let and go right off of the top
Network off of the block, awfully hot
You know I love to kick it with niggas, that off of they pop
We go burn for burn, they learn they turn and stop
What matching the cheeba, traction a fever
All Star like Derek Jeter, how I lift my feeter
Young C-A-Y, chilling with T-High
K-A-Dub-L two E-G fly
Everybody think of somebody, shake up somebody
Wake up the party, bartender break the Bacardi
Ok ok ok shorty, I'm with it with it
Is you with it with it, let's get it get it give me digits
Tell of me who the sickest of niggas, that spit it vicious
Big Poke' with Young Cay, don't forget it

Automatic static, is all you gon see

[Big Pokey]

[Hook - 8x][Hook: 2X]
Banging Screw
That's what south side players do
Smoking sweets, pouring up 4's
Drippin' wet, top down on the low

[Big Pokey]
It's plain to see that I'm one of a kind
Ride I'm in expose my grind
Stash spot just to hold the nine
Plus I got the back bumper folded down
Know a young g for sure to shine
Princess cut, sure to blind
High from hydro I got the drank just the other day, blew my mind
Watch iced out can't see the hand
Diamond bezel, diamond band
4's spinning like a ceiling fan with the top off and the TV playin
All I'm doing is ball-and-parlaying
Ike or Jack does all my spraying
Best believe when I hit the club, be it 4's or dub's, I'm valet-ing
I'm front, maybe not
Might not park just roam the lot
Snatch the Glock up out the stash, steal the clip with a infra- dot
Streets is hot, stay ready for war
Blue, black, or red don't touch my car
Pour it in a pint don't touch my Barre
I'll burn that ass like a cigar
Stay cocked you know the rules
Got extra clip under my shoes
Riding deep with all my trues
Got extra clips for all our tools
Ain't trying to lose, that's why I refuse to lose when I'm on the roll
With the trunk up and the top down showing niggas how to roll

(Chorus)

[Lil' Keke]
This is something, to understand
In order to make a mill you got to have a plan
Leaving many stains in the Caravan
Trying to sit back and be the man
Tell the truth, never lie
Some of these niggas is getting fly
I'm gonna sit back and watch them die
Sipping on drank and staying high
Call me Ke, call me Don
Long as you know that I'm the one
Money by the ton is how I raise my son
Never leave my crib without packing a gun
I been a fool way back in school
Always knew to pack a tool
Catch a chill spot and keep it cool
In the Y2K I ain't change my rules
Better get yours, cause I'm gonna get mine
Trying to get paid without doing time
Throwed in the game and I had to shine
Looking at the roley, it'll keep you blind
Yes indeed, corners bleed, jamming Screw, smoking weed
All the time, gots to grind, that's how a young nigga's supposed to see
Now who it be on the count of three
Everybody here say CMG
Commission Music Group, now can't you see
Microphone check this is Don Keke
Just to let you know, before I go
Nigga gonna still get ten a show
I can put it down on a pen and pad but I was born and raised to be a freestyle pro

(Chorus)(*talking*)
What, South-Southside nigga
What, South-Southside nigga check me out

[Hook - 2X]
Real G's, get the bang on
Fucking with us, we get our swang on
Hustle and grind, and get our game on

Real G's, get the bang on
Fucking with us, we get our swang on
Hustle and grind, and get our game on

[Lil' Keke]
In my two seater, with my black heater
Moving fast as a cheetah, syrup and margarita
Yo shorty, I know you full of that X
Se want the rough raw sex, she got a hell of a neck
You know we presidential, with so much potential
Exploiting this game, because it's so fundamental
We worldwide, internationally known
Real niggas they get it on, the dog is full blown
We below the belt, oh yeah the pain is felt
Rich niggas about they wealth, and keeping up they health
Let's get this money baby, even though these niggas hate me
But I been peeping lately, they think it's all gravy
I'm a maniac, 5"8' and black
I always got a gat, with no time to chat
I hold it down, and stay low to the ground
The bullshit cease, when the Don in town what

[Hook]

[Big Pokey]
Game on, plus the fame got a young nigga name known
Sensei and MJ on the same song, with Don Keke
W dot com I'm a G, see Sensei Don Dada
A ho in hand reach, Sensei done got her
To the Ramada, top flo'
Dominican black, white or vato
Let the game begin, I'm on Jane and Hen
Plus that X in my life, so I'm sane again
I get my bang on, like a Blood or Crip
Keep a snub nose, right above my hip
I love to dip, hoes love my whip
Try to take some'ing, then my snub'll rip
I love this here, gangsta shit
Why, cause I'm a gangsta bitch
Gangsta fits, drop gangsta hits
They fucked up, when they unchained the Pit nigga

[Hook]

[MJG]
MJG, get his pimp on
It's the return of the real, them fony motherfuckers been gone
See bitch, I want your whole bank account
Before you even start to open your mouth, or even think about
Your dedication, is my occupation
This ain't no bullshit baby, this demonstration to concentration
A nigga, just about to bubble up
And if your girlfriend tagging along, then I'ma double up
I graduated, in the streets nigga
When nearly most of the time, the hard way is how I teach niggas
I got a ho, for every holiday
We hit the scene so clean, them other bitches give me body play
If you's a ho, then you was meant for me
And I'ma keep you on the tip of your toes, to pay the rent for me
Why not, show you some career pimping
You exercise my shit, everytime that you deal with me

[Hook]

[Chris Ward]
C. Ward, get his grind on
Only 20-something years young, fool I'm getting my shine on
Frozen Roley, getting it's wind on
While yours ticking, and you know what that mean it tell the time wrong
How come you come off the rich, what is your mind on
Only some dro and potent 4, can get my mind gone
I'm who snitches, drop the dime on
Cause every block I hang slang, and bang is a crime zone
I rhyme wrong, cause I done seen it all
Laughing at these amateurs out here, that just fiend to ball
When rats harass me, I screen the call
Cause I'm a full time playa, even an all season y'all
I got a ho, for every minute man
And even if you're treating her or not, I'm still just a minute and
She gon be hooked on me, like angel dust
Around these here parts, niggas can't bang with us
On top of this, I'm dangerous
Still Mobstyle and gangsterous, I get my bang on

[Hook](*Jadakiss*)
(I'll be by your side) General
We got these niggas, fucking cock-a-roaches
Wanna go to war, a-haaaa

[Big Pokey]
(I'll be by your side), like the gun I pack
When I sleep one eye closed, one eye cracked
Pitbull in the crib, keep one eye back
When Hector come around, I don't run out black
I'm right (by your side), when you need me nigga
I walk by faith, let the Lord lead me nigga
You can even be a hard, or a easy nigga
Rap need me, like George need Weezy nigga
I'm (by your side), whether right or wrong
Niggas choke under pressure, like you lighting a bone
If a nigga try to test, yeah I'ma get this nigga touched
While I'm at the crib layed back, writing a song
I'm (by your side), like a guard and a tackle
Caught a flight to N.Y., went hard in the Apple
Don't be mad cause your broad, in the car with a rapper
Think I'm slow you don't know, I'm the nigga to be right

[Hook]
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side, by your side
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side


[H.A.W.K.]
Like Siamese twins, from boys to men
Like nine, sitting next to ten
Like Mexicans, waiting for that work to come in
The best of friends, everybody think we kin
Cause I'm (by your side), like a nextdo' neighbor
If I know nothing else, I know Christ my savior
Sharp as a razor, even through bad behavior
He was still by my side, like a two-way pager
He's still (by your side), like a passenger seat
Or some peanut butter cuts, in a fo' do' Fleet
Like bass to a beat, I'll make ya complete
Like a couple cuddled up, in between the sheets
I'll be (by your side), even toughest of times
What's yours is mine, every quarter nickel and dime
I spit these rhymes, so that we both can shine
Although sometimes, you may cross the line
I'm still (by your side), like Luke to Vaketsky
Hockey to Wayne Gretzky, or a fly and his pesky
And times to test me, the situation can get messy
I can kill you sometimes, but God won't let me
Cause I'm (by your side), like May to June
Or an unborn child, in a mother's womb
Or a minister, marrying a bride and groom
Or the stars in the sky, next to the moon I'm still

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
(by your side) like 4-5 holsters
From the jail mug shots, to the c.d. posters
I'm a bad boy, nothing like that Martin and Will
From the streets of steel, where they train boys to kill
So I'm (by your side), like the Secret Service
We some three time felons, white folks are nervous
Credit plus capitas, that ass monopoly
I know your every move, like the Paparazzi
Cause I'm (by your side), like a million man march
Pass the microphone, like the Olympian torch
It's back to S.U.C., we still holding it down
In the paint posted up, for the next rebound
Cause I'm (by your side), like Jordan and Scottie
Like H.A.W.K. and Fat Pat, or like Poke' and Lotti
When your mind get weak, and your body is tired
You can open up your blind, cause I'm sitting outside right

[Hook](*talking*)
Yeah (yeah), H-A-dub-K (H-A-dub-K)
The Hardest Pit in the Litter, they been waiting on this here
Broke niggas, get somewhere, cash rules
Everything around us, understand me, what

[Big Pokey]
Cash rules everything around me, I'm a grimy nigga
Patience is a virtue, I call it timing nigga
I get 4 G's around me, 14 for criming
On the phone my dope is ice, I'm 14 and diming
I'm on ladder stairs climbing, fatigue ain't nothing but army clothes
I know my win right, I gotta keep grinding
As long as my figgas is climbing, I'm bout my pay-day
I get mine wrapped, either the yay-way or the AK-way dog
I'm a hood nigga, I'm getting it how I live and
Pay my ties, so I get it back how I give
Now they wanna hound me, majors wanna sign me
Niggas say they love me, but I think they wanna down me
Y'all know where to find me, swimming in money
Cinnamon honey 600's, linen and honeys
I got mo' raps than mummies, I'm trying to get a car bar
I got mines for sale, who wanna bar raw

[Hook - 2x]
Cash rules everything around me
Deep in the slums of the South, is where you'll find me
Use to try to clown me, didn't hang around me
Now that I'm rich, all these hoes wanna hound me

[H.A.W.K.]
Cash rule everything, from lump sums to petty change
From who-do's with bang, to big rims on a Range
I'm true to this game, like Michael Jordan is the hangs
I will do anything, to satisfy my hunger pain
Now way back in the game, nobody gave H.A.W.K. props
Rolled around in drop tops, and pass me up at the bus stop
Now thanks to hip-hop, I'm in a drop top playing hop scotch
I hit a switch and the trunk pops, and bleed y'all day block
For Fat Pat I won't stop, until the world body rocks
And retail shops and mom and pop's, all H.A.W.K. is sold out
For all those who had doubts, look how I turned out
On Yokohamas I burn out, know what I'm tal'n bout
Getting cash is in me, I'm trying to get that Bentley
I want quarters nickels dimes, and I'll even take pennies
Now they green with envy, and I want 'em all to know
Money over everything, even that busted ho

[Hook - 2x]

[Lyrical 187]
Strapped with heat, to knock the dragon off his feet
Take his iron, burn my name up in the streets
90 days 3-65, the grind don't never stop
Niggas still out here hustling, niggas still bleed the block
Can't quit we stay paid, kids gotta eat daily
Circle through big figgas, skeet me up the highways
Y'all said I'd never make it, I stay put it on your grave
Till I die I'm making feddy, trying to fill up a plate
With a home on the range, in the hills of Spain
Naked hoes rolling doja, while I'm holding a range
Never change, I remain to stay ready for whatever
Got a brand on my chest, that's gon be with me forever
Get paid, that's how I was brought up
Never knew how to do nothing else, so I guess I'm just stuck
In the slums in the Dirty South, trying to be a ghetto superstar
Want the big macs and Bentley cars, still in the hood
Still put it down, still don't bar

[Hook - 2x]
