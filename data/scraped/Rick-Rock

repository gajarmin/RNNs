[2Pac]
A military mind, nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind, nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know

[Hook: 2Pac - repeat 2X]
We tradin war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[2Pac]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin on 'nac (Cognac)
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin till I die, these streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin

[Hook] w/ Outlawz

[Kastro]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
Gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all these
Playa hatin niggas position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryin to tell you

[Edi Amin]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game somethin D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And why I do it - the ridin and smokin
Collidin with foes - in the worst place;
Y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us, in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
Y'all be the next in the long line of war stories

[Hook]

[C-Bo]
I breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo-wl of Major Pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
I be the nigga that's pulling the trigger and dumping the hollow points in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
Never been no sign for men call
How we bucks them down on the way to the ground
Ain't nothing but the hog in me
Bust off his dildo, killin up hoes and keep mobbin G
It ain't no calling the funk off
Don't be funking with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
And had them bitch niggas hauled off

[Hook]

[Napoleon]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin flashbacks when niggas ran up
In my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thugging Immortal, got some war stories for you

[Storm]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
Cause the murderous tendencies of my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got you on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin war stories

[Hook]

[2Pac talking]
War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do
Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz
Motherfucking 2Pac a.k.a. Makaveli
Can you feel me?
Just so you know, it's on Death Row
My niggas love that shit
Dramacydal in this motherfucker, heheheh
Yea nigga! Shout out to my niggas Fatal and Felony
C-Bo, the bald head nut, what?
You know what time it is[Busta Rhymes speaking]
Yeah
Shorty, I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gonna hold out neither
I'mma give it all to you baby
It's burnin' on, bust it

[Hook: Busta Rhymes, Mariah Carey]
Baby if you give it to me

As long as you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

[Verse 1: Spliff Star]
We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road
Hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that
Can't talk on the phone
I know you aggrevated
Walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short
How longer can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated
I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

[Verse 2: Baby Sham]
Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'mma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
But when we sex we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the god feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you ma

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Shh, mami listen
I feel ya love for me baby
And how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment
To talk the truth to you
(Listen) I'm never home
I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigga-ma-ro
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

[Verse 4: Rah Digga]
We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from Lucy's and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats (boy)
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

[Verser 6: Mariah Carey]
I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

[Verse 7 : Rampage]
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes speaking with Mariah ad-libs]

So beautiful
Ah-ha I knew you was gon' give me that high note
Mariah
Ah-ha-ha yeah[2Pac] They say

[Intro/Hook]
[B-Legit] Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me a timer
[2Pac] I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
[E-40] Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[2Pac] That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watching for thievin' I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin a bullet in motherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, 2Pac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit]
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot]
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[Hook]

[2Pac] C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40] Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse 3: E-40]
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the trauma plate
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

[Richie Rich]
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double-edgin' for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[2Pac] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo] The whole clickilation fool
[E-4]) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

[2Pac] Why them niggas acting like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at? It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[2Pac] Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane
[E-40] A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboro's regardless playa
[2Pac] You supposed to
Sideways to the next light...[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Y'all can't deny it, I'mma fuckin' rider
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got scales in the trunk with me
Switching lanes, do a buck with me
Y'all can't deny it, I'mma fucking rider
You don't wanna bang with me
And you know I brought my gang with me (ok)
Niggas trip, I got my thang with me

[Fabolous]
Yo, if they want it, cowards get it
They still wonder how I did it
Now y'all with it, these niggas see how I spit it
Huh, these bitches see how I kit it
You can hear my coupe a block away
Bitches be yellin, "Let Me Ride" like they Snoop and Dr. Dre
I keep spittin, them clips copped on those calicos
Keep shittin, with ziplocks of that cali dro'
Keep hittin, and shift blocks for that cali dough
Keep gettin, my tip rocked by them cali hoes
It's William Bonnie, stealin' mamis
Dance closely, even though they feel the llamies
I ain't tryin to send police to ya rest
I'm tryin to put this, piece to ya chest
And you in peace wit the rest
You can release to the press - this how G's ride
From the North to the South to the East to the West, let's go

[Hook]

[Fabolous] + (Nate Dogg)
Yo ma, I got you stuck off the realness
The name's Fabolous, you heard I be
In them trucks wit the wheels glissed
In V.I.P, with buckets of chilled Cris'
'Click, click', who the fuck wanna feel this
I still got them blocks movin, and the system in my truck
That can make it feel like the block's movin
My 6-4's, wit the wheels and the shocks movin
Them boys in blue with the shields and the Glocks movin
(You can't deny it) I'm the same ol' G
The Guc' frames got the same gold G
Duke can you frame O-3, cause if you see me on ya corner wit a 40
It ain't gonna be named Olde E
I might be in Chuck T's, or the Chukka's
And if your duck cheese I'mma fuck her, duck these motherfucker
Ghetto Fabolous, nigga I ride 'til I die
Hollerin 1-8-7 when I ride through the Stuy, fool

[Hook]

[Nate Dogg]
It ain't really dat hard, to get fucked up
Its really quite easy, just step up
I'mma knock him so hard, on his butt
Just like he been drinkin, like he drunk
The fat bitch stood up, just stood up
She bout to be steamin, turn it up
You won't hear a thang, know you won't
You too busy sleepin, won't wake up
You can't deny it

[Fabolous]
The kid pull the four out a little quicker
You might end up the reason, ya homies
Will have to pour out a little liquor
Every stack that a draws out a little thicker
I get brain, kick the whores out a little quicker
You kids rap that's cool
But the kid's wrapped in jewels, the kid clapped that tool
Kidnap that fool, you don't wanna wake up gettin told
That ya kids trapped at school
When the time's right, I'mma put this nine right
To the left side of ya head, push ya mind right
It's still nothin but a G thang, I thought you knew
And I'm bout to do the numbers that they thought you do
Still don't know me, still jump in a Lex
The chain so icey, I got chill bumps on my neck
The NARCS heard, how the krills pump in the 'jects
Still bump in your decks, still dumpin the tec, stillArtist: Richie Rich f/ 2Pac

Song: Niggas Done Changed

Ah, me and my nigga 2Pac
Finna do what we do
Understand this
'Cuz it's way understandable
Niggas done changed, main
You know they done changed, they done changed!
Check this out

[Richie Rich]
A tisket a tasket, my callico made of plastic
And niggas don't make it home, when fuckin' with my dome
In my zone, niggas be gettin' pepper sprayed down
Drinkin' with all the boys done got that heffer laid down
And it hurts, but don't nothin' change, it's all the same
That's why I come real 'cuz I'm so heavy off in this game
I been there, been taught that, niggas screamin' "Caught that!"
Standin' there with them niggas a hand fulla game and believe he bought that
Niggas here, the game is to be sold not told
Ain't no new jack nigga just gon' jump in this ol' shit, and ride on gold
Unh-uh, naw, nigga gotta pay some dues
Nigga gotta feel some blues
See what it feel like to lose
200 bundles, 400 bundles, fuck it, a G
'bout to cook shop, find out you really ain't got no d
You's imaginin' shit, and havin' money punk is real
Don't be the first to get checked
Nigga betta retrospect

[2pac]
No more regular rappin'
Dare me to cap 'em and watch me blast
These niggas be actin' for the simple fact, playa im'a mash
I lash on my enemies for multiple centuries
Forcin' my adversaries to bleed when they seein' me
Though east coast born, I'm west coast raised
Sent so much dick throughout the click that now they Deathrow slaves (bow down)
Father forgive me for thug livin', I'm through with this drug dealin'
I leave it to Clinton and all the niggas that love prison
Brothas be ballin', Rich if you need me, call
I open fire on muthafuckas and murder 'em all
Me Mr. Makaveli, plus I'm bustin' fuck what they tell me
I'm makin' these niggas hop on they toes, it happen daily
I been shot and murdered, can tell you how it happened word for word
But best belive, that niggas gon' get what they deserve
In the same way, God bless my breakas game pays
Gettin' cash and ass for days
Now niggas done changed

Chorus[Richie Rich & 2pac]
The game is to be sold, not told
Still heavy in this game
Niggas done changed, it ain't the same
We been handlin' our business for years
Gettin' respect from all our peers
While most of our niggas incarcerated, doin' years
Bitches is tricky, niggas are snitchy
While playas improve and move positions
Niggas done changed

[Richie Rich]
Call on my real nigga, when it's time to bring the heat
Suburban's swervin' hella deep down your street
Leave your trash can 'cuz it'll be clean when we sweep
Let's duff these niggas and hit they ass with some heat
Blow they chest up, 'cuz they hatin' and segregatin'
Niggas crossin' lanes, it's time to blow your brains
Before I shot this nigga, I heard him scream one love (ONE LOVE!)
Fifteen in the clip, I only used one slug

[2pac]
Hey! Now picture me rollin'
Biggie Smalls got his eyes swollen
My hands on my nuts, I gives a fuck, I'mma die holdin' 'em
Makin' these hoes pause, while schemin' on no drawers'
No money invovled, condom, pussy, dick, and some alcohol
Picture me rollin' (what) horny hoes get they holes dug
I might show 'em thug passion but I'll never show 'em love
Can't hit me in combat, relentless when I ride
Strategize on my enemies, plottin' till they die
Ask me why I'm high, and my reply "Till the day I die"
Don't wanna picture this cold world through sober eyes
Thugs don't die we multiply
Connect with the spirits of fallen homies and bustas, then we ride
Suprise niggas when they seen us, they duck down
(Hahahaha) 'cuz we anticipated endo and bust rounds (buck buck)
Fuckin' clowns still watchin' clips of I Get Around
Scream like a bitch when I beat 'em down
Niggas done changed

Chorus

Outro[Richie Rich & (2pac)]
And they still changin'
Understand what I'm sayin?
(Police switchin up on niggas, judges done changed)
I don't understand that Niggas done changed
(muthafuckas gettin' 60 years for some bullshit)
Nigga, naw what I mean?
(Niggas done changed)
Ah, glad to have you back
That's right big buddy, 'cuz we ain't gon' never change
(They may hold me for a second but these muthafuckas ain't gonna never hold me down, baby)

Yolla, (ewwww!) ice cream candy (What it do?)

Devour any cowards, sours slippery at the lip
Beast, don't suck up to none, don't be no sucker
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucker

If ain't about no gouda, partner you can vanish
Don't get put up in yo' place
Give me 40 feet and an ounce of space

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

So gone on and get yourself a bar of this

European front end with the french fries
How it feel man? What it look like?

To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun
And I bet you can't just eat one (Candy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin to chunk, make the hoes all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady
G-yeah.. she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
I... feel... good about candy (Candy!)
My gangstas understand me

[Verse 4: Goldie Loc]
Shake it baby, don't break it baby, now can you make it clap? (clap!)
Tryna fit this work in your gap (gap!)
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on

Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin, boy
Cause I can't leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy (Candy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Daz Dillinger]

Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
Voila, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for shit
God damn! You already know who I am
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Yeah, nigga.. shot caller
It's America's number one baller

And that's how the shit was handled, first name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and J, E had the Nine and J the AK
Clocked on a street called Henessey
Robbers with a motherfucker named O.E
E had a bitch and her name was Gin
Who had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though
Cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E and J knew tonight they'd come
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and Rum
The cap jacks ho and the sight was scary
The bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi
E and J told Jack the hotel, so Jack tried to bail Juice out the jail
But ol' E had the judge on the payroll clout
So Jack shot the judge up and broke Juice out
And everybody's talkin' 'bout Gin and Juice
Juice shot Gin cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey
Mickey was big, he only sold eight balls
Had ninety-nine niggas up against the wall
E and J found out he made the call
So E and J and Jack and Juice nined them all
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill
Got the money from his bitch reckless Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive
But Mickey he was slick he had a Colt .45
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word
It was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice
It was a hundred and eighty-seven proof, check it out (*echoes*)

(Chorus)
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', ROLL IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', SMOKE IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', ROLL IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', smoke somethin' smoke somethin', DRINK IT UP!!

(Spice 1)
Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird
Time for the Hurricane E said word
Thunderbird in an alley waitin' wearin' a beaniy
Tryin' to get away from the cop Mr. Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird's top
Spilled his drink and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all
Mickey and his boy OD were slangin' eight balls
Of crystal to the strawberries on the hill
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon Blocks
The murderous cop killer Mr. Pimp and Miss Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosey cops
And it made Mr Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the Night Train
Didn't know his wife Champaign would never see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt .45
Gotta peel his cap before the train arrives
Gotta stay low in Broward here comes the train
All the boys said the engineers is Bartles and James
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr Schnapps got up because the cops chased him
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'Vette in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover
Jack was mad because Mickey shot his lover
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced
He couldn't hang with the 1-8-7-the-proof
They all splattered and St. Ides had took a fall
And then Endo smoked 'em all, check it out (*echoes*)

(Chorus)
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', SMOKE IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', drink somethin', DRINK IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', SMOKE IT UP!!
Drink somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', smoke somethin', SMOKE IT UP!!(18 dummy)

Yeah, okay, okay, Doon Coon, Fair gang, Goldie Gold, Stressmatic
All day nigga

[Verse 1: Doon Coon]
El Nino, Brookeville, R-I-P for Fairfield (Berine Mac!)
Stunner van, with the curtains
Bay water be a lot of serpents
But we outta, no baby powder
Same color, Red Lobster, clam chowder
Ghost ride it, three times high and
Federation, remember the Titans
Through the purp smoke beautiful science
I'm outta here like kites with lightning
It's a rap with Rick on the ????
We go dumb, so beast like bison
If you sleazy all you beezies say "we love you Coon"
You want to turf and you got work then we feel you Coon


[Hook]
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy (x5)


[Verse 2: Goldie Gold]
F-E-D. stay going hard
18 dummy on your boulevard
18 dummys that'll pull your card
Go dumb like ???? push online dot com
Your baby Mom got throat that's long
I'm on, haters can't stop me now
Can't get skanks off top of me now
Purp by the pound, scrapers got miles
Hyphy pimped that's Rick Rock's style
Can't leave the game alone, Bay need us now
Punk rocks and the homies get wild
Coon Daddy, I'm G. Diddy, hands on kitty
Yeah muh it's pretty, give me a sign
Tell me when to go, put it in the air
Don't tell me no, no, no, no....


[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stressmatic]
Still hyphy acting the ape
18 dummy, whipping the scrape
Got grapes in the bag, go and get it
Had a car looking like Bigfoot hit it
Swing to the left, all in the block
Niggas all in the curb like "It ain't hot"
Sideshow, police try to ban shit
Niggas going stupid in the AC Transit
Mr. Mattic, you heard me?
I'm a hood star like Earl and B
Off the field, close to buzzin'
In the stunner van with Gino's little cousin
I'm from Fairfield, that's what my mom stays
Strap's in my back pack, nothing like Kanye
Intersection, handle bars, my scraper runs just like Magnum's car

[Hook]
Oh, it's gonna go (x8)

[Goldie Gold]
Yeah, the bitch fucked me, the whole crew too, she's (18 Dummy)
On top of the whip, stomp that shit we (18 Dummy)
Now, now open your doors, let it coast we (18 Dummy)
The ho don't choose, the ho gonna lose[E-40]
Huh? Want me to speak the real?

[Kaveo]
Speak the real man

[E-40]
Nigga speak the real
Speak the real
Speak the real
Speak the real
Speak the real

It's a quarter after nine on my AM FM
Radio Shack digital motel six o' clock alarm reads
"40, get your ass up, time to hit the grind
You can't afford to pass no money I know you heard about that"
What, what? "Task raided Millersville Ms. Miller had a heart attack"
Dude, that's some cold shit, ain't it huh?
I know, she was a good person for certain I know
V-Town, California where I was born, raised and grown
And since 1979 I been a hustler on the go
You know the drill, my mission for real, a mealticket
You feel, we slowly but surely approachin seven digits
Figurines, sticky doo-hicky and angel dust
Mescaline, niggas know better than fuck with us
I'm pimped out flossin in Reno in the casino
Big bid, fuckin off feddie I could've put down on a crib
I does that, I do, rejuvenate, redeem
Take a lose, take a lose
Don't make a scene
Nigga charge it to the triple beam
Fuck the stress
I let that orange box of baking soda do the rest
Holler at my neighborhood chef, Raul
Known for cloning chickens and turning one into two
That's all he do for a living
That's all he's used to
Playtex rubber dishwashing gloves and residue, Biotch!!!!

(Hook)
[Kaveo]
Bullshit ain't nothin
You see we gone keep this thuggin
And mean muggin jump until it's a done deal
You see E-40 and Sick Wid It bring the real nothin but
What if I bring this back down?
You gots to be about it or be without it

[E-40]
Be about it or without it
Ay, you know what? I smell you on that playboy, look
We fin to run down a a whole tac on these bitch ass niggas
Niggas ain't smellin this shit
We do this shit

Last night I slapped a bitch upside her dome
With my faulty phone
That heifer's tired
She tried to slash my tire
Caught me in the bed with her cousin Tanji
From the track
She use to hold my sack
I use to dick her down way back in 86
She use to look just like a skank
But now that bitch got a ass, tits, body and boy that bich is bad
For what it's worth, the pussy smelled like Certs
Victoria's Secret
Now folks just remember I never said I thought about lickin pussy
I said I never thought about eatin
Keepin it and treatin it nice
Fuck that I'm a hog
I put it down, I'm from the hood
Where I live, on the outskirts
And down on the tuck in the cut
In Clemente Apartments man
I'm a baller so you know I ain't got shit in my name
I'm strictly ghetto celebrity, niggas get buried
Ready for combat if you plottin and plannin
Oh if you come for me and confiscate my dough
Let the buzzer be the bail
But my suggestion is to stay within your envelope
I'm block to block, swingin on vines
Community service, put up stop signs

(Hook)

[Kaveo]
Uhhh!!! Hold the fuck on!!
Did you or did you not tell these niggas to stay within they envelope?
Sheeit, these toddlers are green to the game
They ain't know nothin about these tramps
Six bedroom flats and gettin dealt and held a hand across the mat
You see we from the Yay where we control they minds
And put these hoes on the grind

[E-40]
Ain't got to but I still touch it
Went to the Seven Eleven picked up a traders book and bought a bucket
Use to have a perm taller than the Charlotte Hornets
But I had to cut that bitch off cause see your patna had warrant
That I ain't even handled yet although I'm havin cake
The little homie from the hood want me to put out his tape
He kinda tight too, remind me of The Click crew
Cause they was spittin that old high powered
Godzilla ballin guru ass type shit you
Can relate to, wake to, 'scape to when it's sunny
Ride by, slide by, get at a honey
I know these streets like I know my dick
I can tell you who the nigga is that's about to get jacked
And the nigga that pulled the lick
I got this bitch on lock
999,999 plus a dollar in a safe deposit box
Marijuana crops still in this roster
Kilogram, coca leaf and morphien
What about my niggas in the 4-1-5
Look what they made
My niggas in the city
They call it made
Top grade regeneration, uncut
Designer weed, straight hempilation, what the fuck

Sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit sheit, sheit...
Hell yeah, sheit!!
999,999 plus a dollar, plus a dollar man
Plus a dollar, plus a dollar man equals a mealticket bitch
Biotch!!!
Sheit! Sheit!Walla walla walla bang bang (ehh-yeahhhh)
One me on the grand tree damn come from around kingsman (heh heh heh)
Walla walla walla bang bang walla dang dang dang (yea yea)
Walla walla walla bang bang what a dang thang (yea yea oh yea yea oh)

[E-40]
Its smoky up in here, so open up the vents
We heated up in here... with street instruments
My piranhas is hungry, we play for keep
We thick in this booch, we 60something deep
We licorice booch if you feel a frog its leap
Promiscuous booch sometimes we like to cheat
I'm spillin' my liquor, its all on my clothes
I'm Smellin like alcohol bout to follow my nose
I'm mad doggin and thuggin, buckin and grudging
We off of them pills, and we ain't talking bout bufferin
(You flossin grills?) like they do down south
(100 dollar bills?) with furniture in they mouth
If you like it, I love it, when its dry as a drought
If you dig it, I dug it, be about your paper route
If its woofers and sub hits, clientele and clout
Party and clubbing, up in the building talking loud

[Hook]
We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)
We gon' do the fool (we'll be breaking all the rules)
So don't make me murdah (eh)
Emcees up in side (eh)
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass (aye-yeahhhh)

[E-40]
(Yo) I'm having my yay-per, im feeling my scrill
I'm seeing my money mayne, im a hustler for real
Gotta get it while its good, ain't no time to wait
Its dangerous in my hood, with plenty money to make
I'm drinking a beer, im smoking a swisher
I barely can steer, im full of this liquor
I handles my biz, im takin' my exit
Then parking this britch, the magazine street exit
I pull up my truck, im stopping my soul
Stop at the 7-11, talking shit on my phone
Hustler by nature (nature), gangster by choice
I'm checkin' my pager, im checkin' my voice
Re-up and re-coppin', peddlin' and pushin'
More keys than a janitor, my nick-name is bookman
Bitches be lookin', old-folk be starin'
Patin' me down, searchin' the clothes that im wearin'

We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)
We gon' do the fool (we'll be breaking all the rules)
So don't make me murdah (eh)
Emcees up in side (eh)
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass (aye-yeahhhh)

[E-40]
(Yo) mini fourteens, M-1 therapy
AR-15, pimpin' m16s, without me
Won't be no slang in the game, it'll be extinct
I've been bamboozled and hit with mayne
People hit with all kind of these identity thieves
Underrated and hated, on by all these squares in the industry
Man I'm a legend pimp, they call me EE four owe
Ex D-boy used to push that blow
Gas, break, dip, stop, and go
Ride the strip, hit the sto'e
You know that I bought it, you know that I got it
Had to cop a bottle of the blue hypnotiq
Incredible Hulks, you know what I mean
Mix it with some dark and watch that shit turn green
Higher than an elephants eye, me and my guys
Off broccoli and hash, actin a ass...

We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)
We gon' do the fool (we'll be breaking all the rules)
So don't make me murdah (eh)
Emcees up in side (eh)
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass (aye-yeahhhh)

Well allllright
Me a bad man, ruff by nature
You punkin' on me you goin' into danger
Me and the Don, ruff and down low ranger
Me thought me pot was comin' from Jamaica
No mess with stranger, no like imposta
Call me forecaster, we more like rasta
With the mix for ganja, I buy a lil cha cha
When they know inside, they blow sofa

We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)
We gon' do the fool (we'll be breaking all the rules)
So don't make me murdah (eh)
Emcees up in side (eh)
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass (aye-yeahhhh)

Walla walla walla bang bang walla dang dang dang (yea yea)
Walla walla walla bang bang what a dang dang thang (yea yea oh yea yea oh)[2Pac] They say

[Intro/Hook]
[B-Legit] Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me a timer
[2Pac] I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
[E-40] Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[2Pac] That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watching for thievin' I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin a bullet in motherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, 2Pac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit]
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot]
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[Hook]

[2Pac] C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40] Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse 3: E-40]
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the trauma plate
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

[Richie Rich]
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double-edgin' for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[2Pac] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo] The whole clickilation fool
[E-4]) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

[2Pac] Why them niggas acting like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at? It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[2Pac] Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane

Ya honey gone be mine

Ya'll must like ridin' in long black Caddies that they stick coffins in
The clique often been
Blowin' sticky that come in the jars that they stick coffee in

I'm gettin used to strokin' and sweetin', pokin' and skeetin'

You know my.. my whole def-a-nation is to spit straight game
You dig that? (Straight game) I I come from the game baby y'know
I come from this motherfucker, you undersmell that?
Aya, and you know, it's like this nigga
Pimped-out all day you know Hillside Vallejo nigga
You undersmell me? Been speakin the real for many moons
My niggas in the 7-0-7 on down to Compton

I'm in my FUBU drawers, she in her gown
Cause if some cats tryin to have at me
I sick the canine in the background
I'm plannin on splittin my crown but it ain't gon' be too simple
See I'm a baller, I got bars around the window
Rottweilers, pits, aikietas, doberman pischers tanked up in the yard
With a sign on the fence that reads "warning: beware of dog!"
You play the frog if you feel froggish nigga leap
I neglect my dogs, starvin, sometimes they don't eat
Elroy speak to me about my triple-beam; officer, I got proof
Po'-po', that's for weighin nuts and fruits
Run with a whole bunch of rugged rowdy-ass knuckleheads, knahwhatImean?
Big nigga, the size of a football team
I wear these glasses so that I can look like a square
But if you ever see me in a fight with a bear
Don't help me nigga, help the bear!!
Me and my wales, we be coonin
But see you the type of the nigga that'll go in the backroom
And beep yo'self and act like yo' pager boomin

Yeah man, cause a real tycoon
Gon' take this shit from the flo' to the moon
Still Northstar ridin, six-oh strikin
Switch up V-S cherry chokin the wrist and the pinkie
But keep it loose around the neck and make sure hoes in check
So if you gon' fill a nigga cup, fill it up with paper
Cause we ballaholics bitch, ain't that quiet about this shit
If you're on it spend it like you mean it

Uhh, I'll have you
Ever since I was ankle low to a centipede's claw
I always wanted to play pro-baseball
Weepolization family, that's my favorite sport
But instead I'm back and forth to jail and in and out of court
BEOTCH! Serious about my rock shrine
I don't give a fuck how much courage juice you had
Nigga yo' mug don't mean like mine!
I bring the noise like a cymbal {*CRASH*}
I fuck with 40 dem, make you stick your pistol out the window
BEOTCH! Y'all oughta see me at the state fair
Showin off in front of my broad; tryin to win my lil' nieces
One of the biggest stuffed animal prizes there
Nicknamed Charlie but my street name is Earl
Ballaholic like Felix Mitchell nephew Lil' Darrell
I know these streets like the Task Force know dope
I am the streeets, my ghetto pass can't be revoked
Ten percent, I paid my tithes, forgive me for my sins
Smoke an ounce of weed a day, maybe that's why I ain't go no ends

You see, you niggas real truant mayne
Runnin around here puttin a black eye in the game
When we tryin to feed y'all somethin nutritional for the brain
And nourish yo' game
You see there's two type of niggas in this world:
Those that eat and those that don't
What type of nigga is you, you know?
You see we got the tycoon status
Big hogs, tryin to pile the money up out your trash
You dig?

You can call me Lawry's cause I'm seasoned
I eat crevice, but not when it's bleeding
Don't get me wrong, I love sex but I don't play that part
I love Virginia, but not when the Virginia's tart
Toss me good, and I might Dolce and Gabbana it
Gave yo' ass some bread, and let you go buy up some shit
Callin yourself takin advantage of my riches
I'm tryin to be nice to yo' ass
I normally talk bad about you bitches
Invested to "Tha Hall of Game" buggin and bein notorious
For slappin chickenheads upside they weave-a with my Nokia
Mayday mayday, callin all patrol cars and units
Be on the lookout for the Hillside managler, 40-Water the Ballaholic
I'D RATHER FLY THAN RIDE AMTRAK
When I'm in Dallas I fuck with (?), and go hard black
Make an opera singer wanna write some raps
Papered up - like who? Like a fax BEOTCH

I know you didn't say papered up like a fats
(Yeah I did, yeah I did) Yeah, cause we do this shit
Up off the ground on a pitcher's mound
Slidin, to the bad catcher, able to snatch ya
Bat yo' G out the pocket
Run it again with a nigga that's in the socket
And it ain't my problem, if the ho hollerin
We all about dollars, and collar-poppin

BALLAHOLIC BEOTCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![Hook] x2
My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun

[Verse 2: E-40]
Protect yourself at all times, cause niggas be on Belucci and snort lines
Real life, not a movie, hard times
Gotta' be aware, pay attention to your warning signs
That’s why I life live to the end, cause you never know when it’s gon' end
Er'yday my birthday, don’t worry out what I spend
Everything this hustler got, this hustler earned it
Monster, but my first name ain’t Herman
Came in the game with nothin', got out the game with somethin'
Was traffic out there rushin', in the ghetto out there hustlin'
Stacking my chips, eating my bread, strapped with the lead
They want me dead
Knocking a ho, getting some head, on a Sealy mattress bed
Took a left over from my bundle after I copped and bought a drop
Ballin' is fun, I bought it with 1’s, drove it up off of the lot
Went in and got me some slap, and wrapped in matte black
Tinted window front and back, Pontiac and the 20 sack

[Hook] x2
My neck and wrist be shinin' in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun

[Verse 2: Too Short]
Your life is hard, times are tough, looking for money, you can’t find enough
You try rapping, but nobody signed you up
Got some cocaine, try to grind and stuff
Went to jail, now your time is up
Can’t get it all together cause your mind is fucked
Mad at the world cause you ride the bus
Looking out the window, wanna' ride like us
I’ma tell you something that’s good for your health
Never give up on yourself (on yourself)
You never know when it’s your turn to get rich
Brand new whip with a bad lil' bitch
Hun'ed thousand dollars on your first car
Shit can really happen when you work hard
I’ma do it till I’m dead and gone--'Short, dawg (what' you doing)?
I’m having hella fun

[Hook] x 2
My neck and wrist be shinin' in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
16 zippers in a one pound bag, 16 strippers getting down like that
Move around like that, beaver doing great
I remember out of state can't ache for great
I remember how the stake and that [?]
Just touched back down so I’m extra straight
Got a date with an Asian she be raisin' the bar
On half down town, wanna' fuck my car
I’m a real rap star, got the felony flow
Like I robed the bass line and fucked the melody slow
[?] you know, oh, we gon' get rich
Bitch listen to a pimp when he talking that shit
I keep the wood in the whip, kush in the swish
You never seen a black nigga ball like this
In every magazine I be all like this
With the 40k rolly on the wrist

[Hook] x 2
My neck and wrist be shinin' in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun[Xzibit]
Last but not least we off the leash
The Art of War reach for your masterpiece
Feel the release from the phantom bangs you
Snatched off put you in a frame and hang you
Comin at you niggas from a different angle
Arch Angel choke hold and strangled
Kay Slay the game turn the tables
Get cables, I'm Kane you Abel
Start bullshit, conflicts, labels
Man handled, murder, mangled
Life support cut short we hold court
In the street make a nigga sleep six feet deep
Fuck piece bare back doggystyle
Cement ya feet and hold ya down
Throw you off the bridge and watch you drown
Last one to laugh its over now

[Hook]
We'll trade ya six and pancake ya loan
Break ya bitch and take ya doe
Shake ya Crys and take it whoa
Layin down the whole dance floor

Open bar free drinks this way
Walkin the West, possin the South

Hands up jack the whole crowd
(Break yourself right now)

[Xzibit]

Bitches die, cry, and lust for us
Damn it feel good to be platinum plus
Don't fuck wit us cuzz we dangerous
Hold fans like fiends on Angel Dust

Coast like a sailor you fuckin fucks

Don't pop the Crys I pop the clutch
Pop one to ya mouth cuzz you talk too much
Way in over ya head you get played
Left holdin the bag like John Forte
Built for this all work no play here to stay
The rest get blown away
Built for this all work no play here to stay
The rest get blown away
C'mon

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
Neva seen heard felt befo
Wanna rumble wit us just start the show
Fill up the chamber let me go
Out of town before the shells hit the floor
Duck tape ski mask professional
Fuck y'all, y'all homosexual
Hangin on my dick like testicle
Pop you disappear, "Where did he go?"
Pop up some where in Mexico
Rotate relate respect the flow
Hospital bed you vegetable
Can't walk can't talk lettin you know

Why do I feel I still got the flow
(You back kid, Bad Boy for real, Let's go)

[Verse 1]
Before 99 I was born again
5 years later and I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's a oxy moron
Forget a bus, I bought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gone make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up

Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin
Help me lift the big man up (As we proceed...come on....yeah)

[Hook]

Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go

[Verse 2]
Some days I make thousands

Everybody out there wanna know what Mase got
Way hot gray drop Maybach gray yacht (Whoooo)
And that's just the way it be
Favor, people wanna pay for me
When I'm in Mr. Chows, they waive the fee
And I don't chase money man
Money chase me
I give my wife things that she dream and more
I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)
I'm back like Moses to bring the law (Come on)
Brand new saint Mase in mean velour

Fans from Iran and Singapore
And grown men beg me to bring them on tour
Even if it mean they gotta sleep on the floor (Let's Go!!)

[Hook]
Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin' (This for real, Bad Boy)
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go

[Verse 3]
I used to be the guy stood next to Diddy
Crucified for bringin sex in the city
Even though the girls think I'm extra pretty
How I know? I ain't got no extra wit me, oh
With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Ain't no if I... know
I'm the man to plan the way
This ain't my life
I've become a saved (Say what)
Put up a good fight
Like its mandalay
Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God tI'me now, and I don't plan to play
I'm only here for the one thing you lack
And make dj's scratch is he is he back
Kids in the hood stutter it's a it's a fact
It's the kid resurrected it's a it's a wrap
(As we proceed, to give you what you need, he's back)

[Hook]
Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'

Devour any cowards, sours slippery at the lip
Beast, don't suck up to none, don't be no sucker
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucker
Real mannish with my Spanish
If ain't about no gouda, partner you can vanish
Don't get put up in yo' place
Give me 40 feet and an ounce of space

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now-A-Later's, gum drops, jelly beans
Lollipops and triple beams
Blue carpet, yeah that's the treatment
Candy so sweet, got everybody eatin it
Bigg Snoop Dogg, I'm the star of this
So gone on and get yourself a bar of this
No change man.. gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell they call it deez nutz
(Deez nuts!) I'm almond with the caramel insides
European front end with the french fries
How it feel man? What it look like?
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin on some Bud Light
Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun
And I bet you can't just eat one (Candy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin to chunk, make the hoes all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady
G-yeah.. she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
I... feel... good about candy (Candy!)
My gangstas understand me

[Verse 4: Goldie Loc]
Shake it baby, don't break it baby, now can you make it clap? (clap!)
Tryna fit this work in your gap (gap!)
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on

Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin, boy
Cause I can't leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy (Candy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Daz Dillinger]
"It's like candy, candy!"
Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
Voila, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for shit
God damn! You already know who I am
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Yeah, nigga.. shot caller
It's America's number one baller

[Hook][Hook: Nate Dogg]
Y'all can't deny it, I'mma fuckin' rider

You don't wanna bang with me
And you know I brought my gang with me (ok)

[Fabolous]
Yo, if they want it, cowards get it

Huh, these bitches see how I kit it

Bitches be yellin, "Let Me Ride" like they Snoop and Dr. Dre

Keep shittin, with ziplocks of that cali dro'
Keep hittin, and shift blocks for that cali dough
Keep gettin, my tip rocked by them cali hoes
It's William Bonnie, stealin' mamis
Dance closely, even though they feel the llamies

[Hook]

[Fabolous] + (Nate Dogg)
Yo ma, I got you stuck off the realness

'Click, click', who the fuck wanna feel this
I still got them blocks movin, and the system in my truck
That can make it feel like the block's movin
My 6-4's, wit the wheels and the shocks movin
Them boys in blue with the shields and the Glocks movin
(You can't deny it) I'm the same ol' G
The Guc' frames got the same gold G
Duke can you frame O-3, cause if you see me on ya corner wit a 40
It ain't gonna be named Olde E
I might be in Chuck T's, or the Chukka's
And if your duck cheese I'mma fuck her, duck these motherfucker
Ghetto Fabolous, nigga I ride 'til I die
Hollerin 1-8-7 when I ride through the Stuy, fool

[Hook]

[Nate Dogg]
It ain't really dat hard, to get fucked up
Its really quite easy, just step up
I'mma knock him so hard, on his butt
Just like he been drinkin, like he drunk
The fat bitch stood up, just stood up
She bout to be steamin, turn it up
You won't hear a thang, know you won't
You too busy sleepin, won't wake up
You can't deny it

[Fabolous]
The kid pull the four out a little quicker
You might end up the reason, ya homies
Will have to pour out a little liquor
Every stack that a draws out a little thicker
I get brain, kick the whores out a little quicker
You kids rap that's cool
But the kid's wrapped in jewels, the kid clapped that tool
Kidnap that fool, you don't wanna wake up gettin told
That ya kids trapped at school
When the time's right, I'mma put this nine right
To the left side of ya head, push ya mind right
It's still nothin but a G thang, I thought you knew
And I'm bout to do the numbers that they thought you do
Still don't know me, still jump in a Lex
The chain so icey, I got chill bumps on my neck

Got a house in the back with a Benz and dough
Get cha mind right nigga 'fore you mention me

Dogg Pound linked with the Roc could cause traffic
Who want rump, get it crunk with me

You catch Bleek in B.K. (or) down in L.A
With my W and E up nigga, who want play?

Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, concentrate
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, concentrate

{"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" continues to repeat in the background}

[Xzibit]
Meditating, levitating
Greetings from the Golden State
Mr. X, to the Z
Concentrate, come walk with me
Your shit sound so awkwardly
I don't rhyme I just stomp down beats
Real estate, section eight
Which one would you rather take?
Concentrate, move that weight
Show me how you regulate
Hold up, wait, that shit's fake
Get these niggas up out my face
Shake the room, bend the spoon
Turn this up now, stay in tune
Hypnotized by the way she move
Take your time you might arrive too soon

[Hook One]

[Hook Two: Xzibit over 4X of "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"]
Bring that back, what was that?
Oh my lord, she got back
So precise, so deattached
Oh my God, who is that?

[Xzibit]
Hibernate, consummate
Man was made to procreate
My estate, generates
As if my family name was Gates
Days of grace, lift big plates
Why be good nigga, go be great
Hit the breaks, crack them crates
Have you on the run goin state to state
Contemplate, demonstrate
Mind over mayhem, no mistakes
Lift some weights, eat some steaks
But you don't really want that face to face
But let's relax, check your traps
Don't let yo' concentration snap
I love the way she arch her back
Like how a muh'fucker 'sposed to handle that?

[Hook One] + [Hook Two]

[Xzibit]
Breath control, touch yo' soul
Just maintain don't lose control
Participate, congratulate
Cause everything else'll be seen as hate
Remain in place, the same mindstate
Get off yo' ass and celebrate
Congregate, associate
Don't fuck yo'self procrastinate
Dilate, to an all time great
Calculate the next move I make
Crack the safe, keep that ace
In my waistband just in case
I'm no rat can't run yo' race
Not too good don't fit my taste
I love the way she make that shake
Makin it hard to concentrate

[Raekwon]
That's right..
My nigga Clueminatti fuckin wit the intro, to murder somebody
We cheque-cash niggas wit four fingers on 'em
Callin the Lord, "Help me!", that's us
Thrustin through ya hood wit the dust (HOOOOO!)
Lord have mercy, niggas look thirsty, yo
End the swine, meet the inventor, plus the winter
It's mine, gasoline jump, just spiked gloves, nines
Watch my wave push, one chain faded out
Racin to Spain, half a million dollars in Boyd
Willy Aims, slap bop top of ya Glocks, plus black Reebox
Rockin real nigga shit, callin me Pops
Golden pro', kitchen designer shit
Chinchilla blankets, H. Winston anklets on
Drug dealer banquets, hands out, fire when we spit (Haha)
The position is lit, drop fifty out a blimp
Roast ya ornaments, Super Bowl ring on each finger
Gettin fly, might linger, those of you ride
So let the lye sprinkle yo

[Hook 2X: Raekwon (Ghostface Killah)]
Yo we put together like CREAM
Matter of fact like a Jamaican team
Sprangler stats, hatin like Mitch Green
Off the wall auction that dumb out
(We organize exortions)
Burn niggas labels down, frostin 'em

[Ghostface Killah]
Eh-yo, how you like two Ac's?
Max in the trunk, lookin real dumb
Eighty-eight paper and our nose is numb
Prayed over Marvin Gaye's grave
He said Ghost, "Pop merked me at an early age
Hit Diana back in the days"
Them Supreme bitches all on my dick
Loved the way I sung the Cherells
"Mercy, mercy, son", made 'em cum
I wrote songs for the people
Verses that'll make Nixon resign
You can do the same thing with rhymes
"I swear Ghost is doobie, just imagine"
Check out what I started
Who's the first to rock 'fros with out a part in it?
Featherhats partin it, Gladys was the baddest, she wore a six
Pretty-ass foot with an arch in it
Big cars, slammin eight-tracks, slammin tracks
King died in sixty-five, Motown cried
Saw a tear drop from Stevie's eyes
Fogged out glasses
The plan was to bring together all the masses

[Hook 2X]

[Break: DJ Clue *during Hook*]
DJ Clue.. Desert Storm

Temped to clog bed rallies, imagine only seventeen wildin
Who spent thousand on 'em Ballies?
Now I'm just lampin, just stylin out in Cali
Actin like raw is the mission, mission is to slap 'em
Bang jars, movin in psalms, manipulatin my accountant
Relaxin like.. blacks get jobs
Slangin in bangles y'all, chillin from all angles
Don rock more thank you's, gettin my shit washed
Elevator music, Rolex doors with thirty-seven whores

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Huh, I'm Mr. What-The-Fuck-You-Looking-At
I'm Mr. Quick-To-Run-And-Get-The-Gat
Treat you like the hoods like a diplomat
Xzibit used to push a 'llac, now I'm Range Roving
Takin over never sober, bear witness like Jehovah
Enemies fall like October
Restless standing tall like a soldier
We thick like the first Motorola brick cellular phones
Cut to the bone, celebrating "Dre Day"
Love it or leave it alone (ha hah)
Just consider me the heir to the throne
The lifestyle of the savage and well known protecting my owns
Rolling stone bringing it home, time for transition
Don't talk too loud, you might find yourself missing
Look into my eyes, all you see is will to survive
By any means, retreating to the Philippines
To meditate, liftin train like a heavyweight
Hit you and run with a California license plate

[Hook: Xzibit & Snoop]
When y'all niggers stop acting like bitches
Bitches stop actin like niggers we can all clock figures
Hoes on my dick, niggers on my dick
They all on my dick, FUCK THAT SHIT!
When y'all bitches stop acting like niggers
Niggers stop acting like bitches we can all get riches
Hoes on my dick, niggers on my dick
FUCK THAT SHIT! We can all get rich!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Doggy Dogg is 'bout to blow up
All.. these Snoop Dogg haters need to slow up, show nuff
Know what? X, the game is getting slower
But I'm speedin 'em up and leaving 'em
I'm bucking 'em util they bleeding bruh
Hold up, FUCK THAT, you trying to get swoll up
By the mic controller, clip reloader
Frozen exposure, Cordozar the Composer
Sick like a bowl-of, a bowl of deez nuts
Fuck him up, cross him out, then toss him out
With the stamp on his head, nigger Dogghouse
Nigger I'm universal cracking Down South (ya heard?)
Popping my collar with my dick in your girl's mouth, ha ha
You act like a dude you get smashed on fool
Loud-mouth bitches with your fucked up attitudes
Nappy-head hoes, worse than bitch niggers
I treat 'em all the same, bitch check your game!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
With the flick of a wrist, send you deep into the abyss
I don't pop Cryst', but will pop a nigger with this
Made my way to the top of the list, raised your fifth
Anything to keep it moving make it harder to hit
We survive when you thought we was finished and done
Looking over my cold shoulder is Attila the Hun
The gatling gun, guillotine, Don King's American Dream
Since sixteen, shoulda been a marine
Making the whole scene collapse, millennium raps
Why fight for scraps, relax and take the whole plate with ya
The penny pitcher with a whole lot of come and get ya
You gettin my picture or do I have to let 'em hit ya? HUAHH!
Feel the adrenaline rush whenever I bust
Got eyes in back of my head
The people the I trust is just like me
Full of spite with very large appetites
I'm too complex to break down in black and white

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
(AH-AHHH!) Nigger, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, ahhh
Yes.. X to the Z, D-O-double-to-the-motherfuckin-G, OOOH-WEE!
Ahh.. this shit funky right here my nigger

Ahh.. niggers, bitches, niggers, bitches
Niggers, bitches, niggers, bitches
Niggers, bitches, niggers, bitches
Niggers, bitches, niggers, bitches
Niggers, bitches, niggers, bitches
Niggers, bitches, niggers, it's all the same though[Verse 1: Xzibit]

I'm a plastic surgeon, fix your face
I got Nascar novels, I was build to race
Gone the long hot summer, I was gone through space
It's the next best thing, making soda and base
It ain't the drill at a hun', it ain't the paper we're chasing
Or these bitches that you came to toot, is basically basic
I'm getting white boy wasted, I'm waking up with a porn star
She walking around naked like she my personal all star
I push one button and boom: "hey, baby, how can I serve you today? "
Pussy wet like a typhoon. Ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon
Immaculate backstroke, anal and deep throat
Whatever the fuck I want you get to make it happen
Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action
Shit, I'm about to miss my flight
First class to London, fucking with you all night

[Hook: Game]

Back up in this motherfucker, spending all my money in here
Because I don't care blowing kush in the air
Dropping car, feeling like spaceships
Riding with models and stripping ace in the club
Show international girls how to do it with dub
While my chain swing left to right
Came with the party with you, do it all night
My money never run out, we party 'till the sun out
We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out

[Verse 2: RBX]

Wes, uncut, welcome him home
From BJ to YJ, now the G grown
One click of the wrist, the competitor gone
Flight patrol on your turf like the predator drone, whoa
Not to mention pit bull bully
Razore edge bloodline, Nutro fed fully
Stupid, get it right, off the chain for the fight
One flash, green lights Run hit on sight
Let's go to war now, rock the Luger steady
Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready
One finger slice, now you pay the price
Put your life on the line if you feel that nice
Cause running bullshit over here will get you shot
Stupid, I'm the truth that's everything you're not
X marks the spot, that's everything that's hot
And walk right upon you and run everything you got

[Hook: Game]

[Verse 3: Xzibit]

I, I, I hit 'em with a nuke, get the pussy
They're scared to shoot
My niggas get you with the 21 gun, salute
I paratroop to your city, hit the club, recruit
Let's see some titties
Boogie words for shitty birds, I learn from the smartest
Treat the bitch like a bitch, treat the queen like a goddess
I coast it, bum bought it, weighting me down
Sleight the razor to your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope out above law, thousands of pounds
Keep the crowd in a chokehold, deliver the rounds
I'm going from living with clowns to rocking a crown
It protect my self silence oppressed the sound
You was up a body violence, working jaw to the ground
Making how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now
Hear it out, make them dollars work, smoking that loud

[Hook: Game]
