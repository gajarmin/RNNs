In my hood, motherfuckers get it on

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Puttin' on for the city like Snowman
Cause in my city I don't snow, man
And that ain't no diss to Jeezy
Cause Jeezy know what's up, believe
That's my nigga back in Puerto Rico
'Fore the rap shit popped, we were talkin' kilos
Tell the Puerto Rican bitch centerfold the plug
Big bottle of numbers and we call him Nino
Yo, one ounce and a pound bag, I know I'm livin'
I'm a north Memphis nigga till I die, dawg
Yeah, motherfuck a suit and tie, dawg
We don't want our hats to the back with the five, dawg
Bang, put the plug on chill
Told 'em I ain't through yet, hell naw, I ain't retire, dawg

Why you hatin' on a nigga from the city? Lemme shine, dawg

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Yo, I be drivin' all the foreign cars 'til the day I die
Fuckin' all the foreign hoes 'til  the day I die
Went to hit the dealer, then a nigga drove it out
When 'em doors go up, all them panties fallin' down
Niggas ain't know me then, but 'em niggas know me know
When I pull up in the Benz, all the jewels drippin' down
I be fuckin' up arenas, all 'em hoes singin' now
I be fuckin' with them boys that lift you off the ground
I stand out, spent a hun'ed racks to put the band on it
Shawty bendin' it over, let me land on it
Grabbin' brown bags, Uncle Sam, homie
Got the pussy jumpin', dove a HAM on it
Young nigga goin' hard
If you talk about them cars, fuck y'all like the dealer
Now, I did it for my dawgs
I be smokin' out the jar like a dreadlock, haann

[Interlude: Ray Cash]
Ay, Bleed, keep puttin' on

In the plug, put 'em on, yeah

[Verse 4: Ray Cash]
Yeah, East Side for life
I'm a real Cleveland legend, I'm a ride 'til the day I die
Get high, bury me with my chrome .45
Now tell me, now tell me, do that sound familiar?
If you from Cleveland, you all are familiar
If you get money one hundred, you know that we filmin' you

[Verse 5: MGK]
Hold up, bitch, I'm from the land and y'all know that
Y'all never should have let me go back
Even when I didn't had no plaque
I was courtside in the Cavaliers throwback
I was over nineteen ridin' up Miles
Back when I was nineteen turnin' up wild
I was in the flats when the land slanged goals
Ridin' up Satchel when them boys slanged hoes
I was on the clear when L came down
Leavin' out of work, went to rap it downtown
I was in the club when they played "We Ball"
And I repped my hood and everybody started brawlin'
Back when I was sixteen, I was spittin' sixteen
Hoppin' up the Blue Line on 116
Tryin' to get my fifteen minutes of fame, shit changed
Now I'm on the big screen like...

This for all them mothafuckas talkin bout they want beef
But niggas never jump when they see you in the street
Niggas thinkin shit sweet, not knowing bout the missiles and the pistols
If I pop it partna you gon get your issues, when its ripping through your tissue
When it's cutting through your muscle, you understand the reason
Why I wasn't on the tussle, you was jealous of the hustle
I seen it in your eyes, I dont know if its the money or It's me that he despise
Everytime I come around you wanna hop off in the ride
If you dont like me, state your case my nigga you ain't got to lie
If the beef is really B.I.G. then I'm Ready To Die
But I ain't worried about nothing cousin, I know you ain't gonna ride

Fuck niggas like that, the type of cats I dont even try to know
Keep bumpin your gums bitch, watch me come apply the 4
Pound pressure and compress your chest just like a xylophone
You think yo hood get crunk, let me take you to a wildler zone
You can get yo numbers pushed without me having to dial a phone
Out of towners get they asses turned into a pile of bones
Gangstas catching new cases even when they trial is on
I been in real wars when niggas lost bread, lost work, lost territories some lost heads
Reorganized the clique when the under boss fled
And at the same time trying not to run across feds
So who the fuck is you to try and come and judge me
I'm to heavy in this game nigga you can't budge me
You ain't gotta love me mothafucka cuz my momma do
Put that on Pimp C mothafucka you dont want the drama you..

This is payback man, from Cleveland to the public
They thought Cleveland was whack
Nah...not me
Yeah, keep it Cleveland right here man..holla at me..

[Ray Cash]
To all the killas and the hundred dollar billas
Like to welcome you to Cleveland, this the home of Ray Scrilla
Where we all blow swishers, all chase figures
With our eye on the prize, while the law chase niggas, get high!
Comtemplate the paper chasing but them crackas giving complications
Locking niggas up without a combiniton, prison is not in my vision
Even though it coincide with the life and the way that I'm living
My mind designed with a divine sense of division, multiplication and addition
I'm a math-a-gician, I was taught to subtract anything trying to intervene and
To distract the type of paper that I'm trying to attract
We really dont wanna have to clap, but if it has to happen
Its happened as simple as that, chip stacking rather its coming from
Jacking the packs, I hustle, but it just so happen I rap, and I'm back and this is...

[Hook]
(scratching) Payback, Payback
Payback, Payback
Mothafucka this is..
Payback, Payback, Payback
From Cleveland to the public this is..
Payback, Payback, Payback, Payback
(repeats)

[Ray Cash]
To all the killas and the hundred dollar billas
Dropping big faces, popping cham by the cases
Hustling states to states switching your location
I applaud you all, you deserve an ovation
But hit the blunt for those in isolation, got hot knocked
Inside of a box pacing, waiting, patient for they day of arraignment
Worried about they family and time they facing
Look don't worry about the streets, the streets ain't changing
Me I'm doing good dog, hope yall maintaining
These hoes ain't changed man, we still bang em
When theirs beef off in the street we still flaming
But dont worry about the drama, nigga worry about your mama
Write her letters, I'll fly you this kite, know your nights is hard
Know you hate it in the yard, rather be out here pushing raw
But when you get released, come holla at your dog
And we can give these fuckas...huh

[Hook]
(scratching) Payback, Payback, Yeahh...
Payback, Payback
Cuz this is..
Payback, Payback, Payback
Mothafucka this is...
Payback, Payback, Payback, Payback
Heh, niggas thought Cleveland was whack man, thats funny to me..

[Ray Cash]
Who wanna challenge, ? me and my nigga battle cry was do or die
So if its you and I, uno got to go then you should know I must survive
Ain't no surprise, money values always out a niggas' life
Before I snitch I bet I die, no witness live to testify
I let the fact remain, leave the crack or rap game
My shit the same, only face I change at a green exchange
From George, to Abe, from Abe to Andy, Jack to Grant
Ulysses and Benjis, pinkies make niggas green with envy
My goal is not a Bently, listen my goal to have control of a digi
With 6 o's and can't nothing prevent me, simply
The nigga in me got me drinking remy, I'm greedy therefore
I'm needy and so I need more than demi, plus the flow is good and plenty
You can pick your favorite rapper..innie-minnie-miney-moe
Compared to me they tiny though, now say something
To all my niggas with that scrilla could you stay fronting, killas spray something
Give these mothafuckas...huh

[Hook]
(scratching) Payback, Payback, Yeahh..I had to do it man...

(repeats)[Intro]
That's right, uh... recognize real ghetto vision, nigga
Cleveland... open up ya' doors

[Verse 1: Ray Cash]
I'm in the old school '84 Delta 88
Wit' a ounce, but I'm bouncin' like I'm out here movin' weight
Bone and Biggie in the Pioneer as I reminisce
Before that it was "D'evils" took 'em back to '96
I went down to houston for some face, Mary Jane
What a coincidence I'm blowin' Swishers doin the same thing
Six-hundred for some big O's, 400 degrees
I'm a ho, Playaz Club, Ice Cube, Master P
And since I'm movin' my yay, know I got "UGK"
Ridin' dirty lookin' for that high life pimp what more can I say?
I'm just stickin' and movin', under my seat is my tool, and I keep it for
Any nigga wanna be trippin' or foolin'
I'm just bumpin' my music as I'm spinnin' the ben
I'm bumpin' *Pac*, picture me rollin' without spillin' my Henn'
Yeah... Yeah, now as I spin and I bend
I'm bumpin' *Pac*, picture me rollin' without spillin' my Henn'

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm just bumpin' my music... music... music..
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow..

[Verse 2]
Now back to the '84 big body 2 door
No blades on the muh'fucker but it still roll
Memba' what told you what I had stashed in the dash
Back in the past... well... now I got two O's
Ricky tells, two show, comin' out hard
Doors wide open, kids dancin in the yard
While I'm stuntin' like Evel Knievel man
Bumpin' Cutlass, Monte Carlos and Rivas man
Rollin' in "slow mo", like the whole block screwed
Black Ville '79, bumpin' Devin the Dude
On the way to the telly, we was bumpin' R. Kelly
And right before I cut her, it was "Confessions" from Usher
She ain't used to a thug, she love the way I ride
While I'm bumpin' "My Life" by Mary J. Blige
See I damn near cried day Rick James died
See that shit was cold blooded, but the music keep pumpin'

[Hook]

[--Verbal--]
Yeah... Face Mob is in the builind
I'm in the area
Hey, I like that shit you on, ya dig?
And I got some shit I'mma put you on... I'mma put you on that shit I be on

[Verse 3: Scarface]
It was like FUCK THE POLICE comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga blowin' *Big* comin' down
A Nigga With the Attitude, Easy, Ren, Dre, and Cube
Creepin' up the avenue, that how you had to do
YES... I'm the rhythm, the rebel without a cause, never lowerin' my level
I'm on some Chuck D shit from P.E
Six in the mornin' I hustle with Ice-T
Six in the evenin' I'm chillin' wit' Willie D
Leavin' out the nickel I'm bumpin' some Kool G. Rap
Back to the neighborhood, shoot me some craps
I'm fuckin' wit' that pluck wit' the kool aid pack
And now I got a brotha by the name of Warren Lee
Hot shot Regal illegal, like marley
I get down like I'm BDP
Ass blaster like blast faster cocked and squeeze

[Hook][Intro]
Take how you want it
Take, take it how you take it
Take, take it how you want it
Nigga, nigga...

[Ray Cash]
Shall I speak on my niggas behalf
You niggas want drama, I'ma get off in yo ass
How you love that, easy come, easy go
Oh you want me to flow, so you stressing the raw
Yeah thats what you looking for
See all my niggas know is pain, put me in the street
And you see all I know is gain, why, yall niggas is lame
I only fuck with dogs, cross me now you see my niggas is raw
You fucking with a god, see I got nothing to lose, but you go all out
See you got something to prove, ooh I ain't fuckin with you
So if I do a show, and get the crowd hype and you ain't got my dough
I'ma up pipe, so now you know the deal, now you know whats real
Shit I spit is ill, I know my niggas kill, but you can..

[Chorus] x2
Take how you want it
Take, take it how you take it
Take, take it how you want it fucka
However you want it man


[Ray Cash]
For dollars I would send you for a ? to get Excursion with Eddie Baur
? Impallas and problems plus my gun will show my power
Picture me rollin', heavy Chevy oh no it ain't stolen
And plus this dick that I'm holdin got these hoes wide open
Stick my finga up to the world, hold em to my scrotem
Niggas think I ain't gonna rep, well I guess I gotta show em
You gotta know when to hold em', gotta know when to fold em'
You gotta know when to pay em, prasie em, play em or blow em
You gotta know when to drop you a nigga or chop you a nigga
Say fuck hip-hop and flip-flops you a nigga
I'm dope, you cook me up I'm rockin it nigga
I'm A-1 Ivory put stock in me nigga, but you could..

[Chorus]

[Ray Cash]
I've been poppin my collar, since poppin a collar been popular
Cuz I'm fresh to death and popular dont mean I won't pop at ya
I know niggas who run and hide, boys who bust shots at ya
Choose your side of the field, you pick mine I'm gonna ride with ya
Last beef I had, really couldn't bust a nigga head
I just signed my papers, Manolo went to get my bread
I know this gonna be heard by the police and the feds
But I'm gonna kill that mothafucka you tell em what I said
Cuz he could..

[Chorus]

[Ray Cash]

Yuh know, Paul Wall weh yuh seh!!!

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I'm leanin, I got my drink poured up extra thick
The mud is purple, grab a cup of ice and take a sip
Pour a ounce, pour a deuce, baby pour a fours
Have a taste, drink it slow, and you be on the floor
The dro is twisted up, but me, I'm 'bout to mix it up
Drinkin that expensive taste with Skinhead Rob I'm leanin tough
I'm talkin 'bout the ocean potion call it Texas tea
Leanin like a kick stand pass it right here straight to me
My partner Keke gave me tips and put me on game
He told me splash some grape soda call it purple rain
I need that potent dungeon punch, pour me up a cup
Everytime, it come around, I'm leaning off that purple stuff

[Bridge: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around, come around, come around, come around...

[Verse 2: B-Real]
We break it up, roll it up, light it up, smoke it up
And pass it to the left until you tell us that you had enough
Inhale, exhale, blow the smoke out your lungs
Once you hit the kush I think you know just where I'm comin from
They call me green thumb, if you need some
I excercise my freedom and bring you the best weed son
See son, in the kingdom we got it down
We smokin up the green shit money no Bobby Brown
It's funny how we blaze it in the club, in the spliff or in the blunt
You can put it in the pipe and smoke it up all night
What you hatin for I smoke with the spirit of Bob Marley
If you think you gonna stop I'm sorry not hardly
Feelin kind of oddly, defiant, and ready to party
And gettin retarded, once this motherfuckin session started
We blown trees up sp freeze up ease up
The general population sayin please relief us

[Bridge: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around, come around, come around, come around...

[Verse 3: Shaggy]

[Bridge: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around, come around, come around, come around...

[Verse 5: Ray Cash]
Nothin less than a hundred pounds
I'm known to smoke heavy but yet and still it goes down
Connectin' with the pounds of the good kush and good haze
Good weed keeps me high, same time, keeps me paid
Sweet sweet sensi mixed with blueberries and grapefruits
Gobble up that fruit salad
Wash it down with Grey Goose
Cheapest price in the city if you need that direction
Them dope boys love me (Love me) They smoke that steady fetti
My eyes are, heavy, shoulders, lean
On that, Dro like, boing-oing-oing-oing
Talkin, slow like, nah, mean
Resources is that purple, I blow it by the circle
Look, I know the tin man, the real tin man
(Nigga, you Cash?) No, really, we close friends, man
And my homey Gill got his ass across the border
I've been waitin five days and today I got my order
Like finally.........

[Chorus: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around

Holla BackKing Chip

A nigga just left out landmarks
On 55th and I’m feelin’ well
Told my nigga Ma$e
Before he got locked up I was gonna give him hell

Reminiscing my past life
As a young nigga tryna hit a lick
Only thing you can say about chip
Is that nigga cold in that denim shit

I’m all in the hood politics
If you pop in then they watching you
Just found out this badass bitch
In cleveland heights was prostitute

These hoes wanna fuck with the king
Cuz they heard I got lots of loot
Bitch ass nigga wanna pose a threat to a real king
Then I got to shoot

Blow these ho nigga heads off
Then I’m headin off to feelin good
Moved out to ? 55
Might catch a nigga in hollywood

My uncle is laying down
I’m used to seein him breathing
Came back home for a funeral
THis ain’t nothin new this cleveland

I’m lookin forward to never lookin back again
Cuz I’m a dad now
All that young shit I was on can’t take it back
But that’s dead now

Damn I done got my mind right
4 blunts rolled and a double cup
Perfect as I wanna be
Got no stress cuz I don’t give no fuck

Chorus

And it’s 7am on St. Clair
It’s 7am
7am on St. Clair
7am

My nigga it’s 7am on st. clair
And I’m feelin good
Nigga I can float through any hood
Nigga I float through any hood

Ray Cash

Started from the bottom
Started from the gutter
And she in my bed

You know I get bread
Better believe that pussy’s butter
She give good head

I used to get bread
With her older brother
Til the judge gave him two

But he kept it true
You know old girl do
Baby mother, yup
Small world

Nigga I’m just tryna function
Just licked a liq store on london
At the light just me and my weapon
At the marathon on 152nd

Police all in my sight
Pulled right to fuck up my night?
Sippin’ my double sprite life is a forty
Take me a sip as I ride by the forty

Double cup eases the pain
Molly all up in her drink
Kush in the air what is the Clair
We’re on 117

Shout out to my nigga Ma$e
Real niggas don’t talk
If this was st clair 2008
Then I’d be with my nigga hawk

I’m on 99th in my own head
Breakin bread cold chillin
Know real niggas from every hood
That’s on st. clair and that county building

I’m certified
East side of King
My bitch a 10 fine queen
Went down the way got on the freeway
Got off on Martin Luther King

Chorus

About 7am on St. Clair
It’s 7am

That's right, uh... recognize real ghetto vision, nigga
Cleveland... open up ya' doors

[Verse 1: Ray Cash]
I'm in the old school '84 Delta 88
Wit' a ounce, but I'm bouncin' like I'm out here movin' weight
Bone and Biggie in the Pioneer as I reminisce
Before that it was "D'evils" took 'em back to '96
I went down to houston for some face, Mary Jane
What a coincidence I'm blowin' Swishers doin the same thing
Six-hundred for some big O's, 400 degrees
I'm a ho, Playaz Club, Ice Cube, Master P
And since I'm movin' my yay, know I got "UGK"
Ridin' dirty lookin' for that high life pimp what more can I say?
I'm just stickin' and movin', under my seat is my tool, and I keep it for
Any nigga wanna be trippin' or foolin'
I'm just bumpin' my music as I'm spinnin' the ben
I'm bumpin' *Pac*, picture me rollin' without spillin' my Henn'
Yeah... Yeah, now as I spin and I bend
I'm bumpin' *Pac*, picture me rollin' without spillin' my Henn'

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm just bumpin' my music... music... music..
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow..

[Verse 2]
Now back to the '84 big body 2 door
No blades on the muh'fucker but it still roll
Memba' what told you what I had stashed in the dash
Back in the past... well... now I got two O's
Ricky tells, two show, comin' out hard
Doors wide open, kids dancin in the yard
While I'm stuntin' like Evel Knievel man
Bumpin' Cutlass, Monte Carlos and Rivas man
Rollin' in "slow mo", like the whole block screwed
Black Ville '79, bumpin' Devin the Dude
On the way to the telly, we was bumpin' R. Kelly
And right before I cut her, it was "Confessions" from Usher
She ain't used to a thug, she love the way I ride
While I'm bumpin' "My Life" by Mary J. Blige
See I damn near cried day Rick James died
See that shit was cold blooded, but the music keep pumpin'

[Hook]

[--Verbal--]
Yeah... Face Mob is in the builind
I'm in the area
Hey, I like that shit you on, ya dig?
And I got some shit I'mma put you on... I'mma put you on that shit I be on

[Verse 3: Scarface]
It was like FUCK THE POLICE comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga blowin' *Big* comin' down
A Nigga With the Attitude, Easy, Ren, Dre, and Cube
Creepin' up the avenue, that how you had to do
YES... I'm the rhythm, the rebel without a cause, never lowerin' my level
I'm on some Chuck D shit from P.E
Six in the mornin' I hustle with Ice-T
Six in the evenin' I'm chillin' wit' Willie D
Leavin' out the nickel I'm bumpin' some Kool G. Rap
Back to the neighborhood, shoot me some craps
I'm fuckin' wit' that pluck wit' the kool aid pack
And now I got a brotha by the name of Warren Lee
Hot shot Regal illegal, like marley
I get down like I'm BDP
Ass blaster like blast faster cocked and squeeze

Niggas thinkin shit sweet, not knowing bout the missiles and the pistols
If I pop it partna you gon get your issues, when its ripping through your tissue
When it's cutting through your muscle, you understand the reason
Why I wasn't on the tussle, you was jealous of the hustle
I seen it in your eyes, I dont know if its the money or It's me that he despise
Everytime I come around you wanna hop off in the ride
If you dont like me, state your case my nigga you ain't got to lie
If the beef is really B.I.G. then I'm Ready To Die
But I ain't worried about nothing cousin, I know you ain't gonna ride

Keep bumpin your gums bitch, watch me come apply the 4
Pound pressure and compress your chest just like a xylophone
You think yo hood get crunk, let me take you to a wildler zone
You can get yo numbers pushed without me having to dial a phone
Out of towners get they asses turned into a pile of bones
Gangstas catching new cases even when they trial is on
I been in real wars when niggas lost bread, lost work, lost territories some lost heads
Reorganized the clique when the under boss fled
And at the same time trying not to run across feds
So who the fuck is you to try and come and judge me
I'm to heavy in this game nigga you can't budge me
You ain't gotta love me mothafucka cuz my momma do
Put that on Pimp C mothafucka you dont want the drama you..

Holla Back[Intro]
Yeahh...Yeahh
Huh..What..Yeah

This is payback man, from Cleveland to the public
They thought Cleveland was whack
Nah...not me
Yeah, keep it Cleveland right here man..holla at me..

[Ray Cash]
To all the killas and the hundred dollar billas
Like to welcome you to Cleveland, this the home of Ray Scrilla
Where we all blow swishers, all chase figures
With our eye on the prize, while the law chase niggas, get high!
Comtemplate the paper chasing but them crackas giving complications
Locking niggas up without a combiniton, prison is not in my vision
Even though it coincide with the life and the way that I'm living
My mind designed with a divine sense of division, multiplication and addition
I'm a math-a-gician, I was taught to subtract anything trying to intervene and
To distract the type of paper that I'm trying to attract
We really dont wanna have to clap, but if it has to happen
Its happened as simple as that, chip stacking rather its coming from
Jacking the packs, I hustle, but it just so happen I rap, and I'm back and this is...

[Hook]
(scratching) Payback, Payback
Payback, Payback
Mothafucka this is..
Payback, Payback, Payback
From Cleveland to the public this is..
Payback, Payback, Payback, Payback
(repeats)

[Ray Cash]
To all the killas and the hundred dollar billas
Dropping big faces, popping cham by the cases
Hustling states to states switching your location
I applaud you all, you deserve an ovation
But hit the blunt for those in isolation, got hot knocked
Inside of a box pacing, waiting, patient for they day of arraignment
Worried about they family and time they facing
Look don't worry about the streets, the streets ain't changing
Me I'm doing good dog, hope yall maintaining
These hoes ain't changed man, we still bang em
When theirs beef off in the street we still flaming
But dont worry about the drama, nigga worry about your mama
Write her letters, I'll fly you this kite, know your nights is hard
Know you hate it in the yard, rather be out here pushing raw
But when you get released, come holla at your dog
And we can give these fuckas...huh

[Hook]
(scratching) Payback, Payback, Yeahh...
Payback, Payback
Cuz this is..
Payback, Payback, Payback
Mothafucka this is...
Payback, Payback, Payback, Payback
Heh, niggas thought Cleveland was whack man, thats funny to me..

[Ray Cash]
Who wanna challenge, ? me and my nigga battle cry was do or die
So if its you and I, uno got to go then you should know I must survive
Ain't no surprise, money values always out a niggas' life
Before I snitch I bet I die, no witness live to testify
I let the fact remain, leave the crack or rap game
My shit the same, only face I change at a green exchange
From George, to Abe, from Abe to Andy, Jack to Grant
Ulysses and Benjis, pinkies make niggas green with envy
My goal is not a Bently, listen my goal to have control of a digi
With 6 o's and can't nothing prevent me, simply
The nigga in me got me drinking remy, I'm greedy therefore
I'm needy and so I need more than demi, plus the flow is good and plenty
You can pick your favorite rapper..innie-minnie-miney-moe
Compared to me they tiny though, now say something
To all my niggas with that scrilla could you stay fronting, killas spray something
Give these mothafuckas...huh

[Hook]
(scratching) Payback, Payback, Yeahh..I had to do it man...
Payback, Payback

Payback, Payback, Payback, Payback

If you get money one hundred, you know that we filmin' you

[Verse 5: MGK]
Hold up, bitch, I'm from the land and y'all know that
Y'all never should have let me go back
Even when I didn't had no plaque
I was courtside in the Cavaliers throwback
I was over nineteen ridin' up Miles
Back when I was nineteen turnin' up wild
I was in the flats when the land slanged goals
Ridin' up Satchel when them boys slanged hoes
I was on the clear when L came down
Leavin' out of work, went to rap it downtown
I was in the club when they played "We Ball"
And I repped my hood and everybody started brawlin'
Back when I was sixteen, I was spittin' sixteen
Hoppin' up the Blue Line on 116
Tryin' to get my fifteen minutes of fame, shit changed
Now I'm on the big screen like...

They need muzzles, dog they woof the heart
Figure I'll let 'em live, now later I whoop 'em hard
Y'all I swear to God, God I swear to D
Some niggas G, but other niggas don't compare to me
They ain't my pedigree, we ain't the same breed
We have nothing in common, not even the weed
See this shit that I'm smokin, not even seed
Take a hit of this and mybe you could be just where I be
Until then , you niggas know they gang I claim
Recognize Bill St. Gang (do the damn thang!)
Chea! It's no place like home, I return wit'out Toto (wit'out Toto)
Had to turn away when Tony killed Minolo (uh)
If you remembered the beef then you should remember the speech:
Live life like a boss, a man dies on his feet
From the cradle to the grave where my regrets I should suffer
From now until then, I murder for my Little Brother
So, bring it on if you think you could hang
But if not then let me do my thang, yeah..

I'm leanin, I got my drink poured up extra thick
The mud is purple, grab a cup of ice and take a sip
Pour a ounce, pour a deuce, baby pour a fours
Have a taste, drink it slow, and you be on the floor
The dro is twisted up, but me, I'm 'bout to mix it up
Drinkin that expensive taste with Skinhead Rob I'm leanin tough
I'm talkin 'bout the ocean potion call it Texas tea
Leanin like a kick stand pass it right here straight to me
My partner Keke gave me tips and put me on game
He told me splash some grape soda call it purple rain
I need that potent dungeon punch, pour me up a cup
Everytime, it come around, I'm leaning off that purple stuff

We break it up, roll it up, light it up, smoke it up
And pass it to the left until you tell us that you had enough
Inhale, exhale, blow the smoke out your lungs
Once you hit the kush I think you know just where I'm comin from
They call me green thumb, if you need some
I excercise my freedom and bring you the best weed son
See son, in the kingdom we got it down
We smokin up the green shit money no Bobby Brown
It's funny how we blaze it in the club, in the spliff or in the blunt
You can put it in the pipe and smoke it up all night
What you hatin for I smoke with the spirit of Bob Marley
If you think you gonna stop I'm sorry not hardly
Feelin kind of oddly, defiant, and ready to party
And gettin retarded, once this motherfuckin session started
We blown trees up sp freeze up ease up
The general population sayin please relief us

Nothin less than a hundred pounds
I'm known to smoke heavy but yet and still it goes down
Connectin' with the pounds of the good kush and good haze
Good weed keeps me high, same time, keeps me paid
Sweet sweet sensi mixed with blueberries and grapefruits
Gobble up that fruit salad
Wash it down with Grey Goose
Cheapest price in the city if you need that direction
Them dope boys love me (Love me) They smoke that steady fetti
My eyes are, heavy, shoulders, lean
On that, Dro like, boing-oing-oing-oing
Talkin, slow like, nah, mean

Look, I know the tin man, the real tin man

Yeah, my dap is worth 100 raps
Where them bad bitches at
Drop that ass and run it back
She onstage goin HAM like she hope I see her
Well they do that at
Shit, right over here
Haters gimme cold mugs like dentine
But nevertheless the 40 cal up in these slim jeans
You niggas hoes
We don't owe you nada
You niggas mad I push out something cold for the summer
She chose me that means she don't think she too cute
Do what you want
Don't wait for what you want to do you
Now its some ladies over here and some women over there
There's some hoes in this house bad bitches everywhere

[Hook]

To the floor bitch[Intro]
Yeah..uhh..

Feel good, so good
Gettin paper nigga, so much paper man
Quarter mill off Sex Appeal
What you know about that.....Hey!
Eastside for life, I'm a Cleveland nigga
I'm gonna ride to the day I die, get high
Bury me with my chrome 4-5

[Chorus]
Tell these haters I'm gettin, that dough
Make a hater wanna hate me even more
Tell me is it my swag, the way I ride
Cuz you frequently might see me in your trap
Tell these haters I'm gettin, that dough
I make a hater wanna hate me even more
Tell me is it my chain, my bling
Cuz a nigga simply Do The Damn Thing!
Tell these haters I'm gettin....

[Ray Cash]
I'm gettin that dough, I make a hater wanna hate for sho
Cuz I'm here doing shows, gettin dough
Quarter mill off of Sex Appeal, you'nt know
Now blame it on the flow, blame it on the dro
It's alot of niggas pissed cuz I hit they ho
But it wasn't my fault, the life I bought
She lookin at me wonder how much my jewels cost
I asked her was I fresh, she replied "yes"
Still captivated by the diamonds on my chest
I told her take a guess, couple for the watch, couple for  the chain
Girl I Do The Damn Thing!
Don't forget the ring baby peep my swag
Got dro by the jar homie, I dont fuck with bags
I'm the realest rapper that this city ever had
Rick Realla's? in the building, you dont like it kiss my ass
Man we down to blast, catch us hanging out the window
If you want beef, dont think you knowin what you in for
Listen here fam, I'll blare em at your kinfolk
Until it blast I'm poppin tags, nigga watch me spend more

[Chorus]

[Bridge] 2X
Get Money!
Let em hate!
Ride big!
Push weight!

[Ray Cash]
I'm gettin that cheese, and thats why you niggas hatin on me
See now I understand, I'm the mothafuckin man
Doing what I wanna to do, you doing what you can
Got my gun up in my hand, Cartier frames
Cost over a grand man I see every thing
I did it for the paper, but they gave me the fame
So in return, hey..Do The Damn Thing!
I ain't here to stunt, I ain't come here to floss
I just came to tell you niggas I'm the mothafuckin boss
And if you wanna rap, it just might cost
You might win some, but yo ass just lost..

[Chorus]

[Bridge] 2X
Get Money!
Let em hate!
Ride big!
Push weight!

[Chorus][Intro]
Take how you want it
Take, take it how you take it
Take, take it how you want it
Nigga, nigga...

[Ray Cash]
Shall I speak on my niggas behalf
You niggas want drama, I'ma get off in yo ass
How you love that, easy come, easy go
Oh you want me to flow, so you stressing the raw
Yeah thats what you looking for
See all my niggas know is pain, put me in the street
And you see all I know is gain, why, yall niggas is lame
I only fuck with dogs, cross me now you see my niggas is raw
You fucking with a god, see I got nothing to lose, but you go all out
See you got something to prove, ooh I ain't fuckin with you
So if I do a show, and get the crowd hype and you ain't got my dough
I'ma up pipe, so now you know the deal, now you know whats real
Shit I spit is ill, I know my niggas kill, but you can..

[Chorus] x2
Take how you want it
Take, take it how you take it
Take, take it how you want it fucka
However you want it man


[Ray Cash]
For dollars I would send you for a ? to get Excursion with Eddie Baur
? Impallas and problems plus my gun will show my power
Picture me rollin', heavy Chevy oh no it ain't stolen
And plus this dick that I'm holdin got these hoes wide open
Stick my finga up to the world, hold em to my scrotem
Niggas think I ain't gonna rep, well I guess I gotta show em
You gotta know when to hold em', gotta know when to fold em'
You gotta know when to pay em, prasie em, play em or blow em
You gotta know when to drop you a nigga or chop you a nigga
Say fuck hip-hop and flip-flops you a nigga
I'm dope, you cook me up I'm rockin it nigga
I'm A-1 Ivory put stock in me nigga, but you could..

[Chorus]

[Ray Cash]
I've been poppin my collar, since poppin a collar been popular
Cuz I'm fresh to death and popular dont mean I won't pop at ya
I know niggas who run and hide, boys who bust shots at ya
Choose your side of the field, you pick mine I'm gonna ride with ya
Last beef I had, really couldn't bust a nigga head
I just signed my papers, Manolo went to get my bread
I know this gonna be heard by the police and the feds
But I'm gonna kill that mothafucka you tell em what I said
Cuz he could..

[Chorus]

[Ray Cash]
What my niggas want?
Hoes!
What my niggas need?
Dough!
What my niggas love? (what)
Hennesy and weed! (yeah, yeah)
What my niggas want?
Hoes!
What my niggas need?
Dough!
What my niggas love? (what)
Hennesy and weed! (yeeeah)

[Chorus]
