[Intro]
"We did it like that and now we do it like this"
"We did it like that and now we do it like this"

[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
Now clock, kids, who got the cocaine?
Don't tell me it's the little kids on Soul Train
The metaphor sent from my brain to my jaw
It comes from other places, not the tinted faces
Journalistic values are yellow and then of course falters
You watch Channel Zero with that bitch Barbara Walters
She'll have you believe black invented crack
When President Lyndon had the formula way back
In '63 with Kennedy, yes the double cross
Remember that's when they blow his fucking head off
Vietnam vets come back looking like one-armed pets
Nixon bounced pure checks
No picket fence, no job, no 8-Cylinder car
Blue collar turns to bourgeois
Depressed in your chest, Demerol, for sess
No dough, crack in vials much less
Whitey can sell on the corners of Bushwick
Whitey can sell on the corners of Flatbush
White Tees can sell on the corners of Bed-Stuy
Pass the torch to that nigga guy
So just die, nigga, die, nigga
You're too black, you can't handle, you're too strong
Get high, fly clock next boost ya steal
In '95 we take back Ebbets Field

[Verse 2: O.C]
Brooklyn, traveling distance to party
Brooklyn, absent at functions, not hardly
Brooklyn, the name alone holds Godly
You don't know, you better ask somebody
Crack filled streets since '85
The beast getting paid to not bust, hookers drawers got crust
Claps clapping regular, hardcore niggas with
Fat gold chains, on the corner maintaining
Gold teeth flashing, stick-up kids playing in front of
Latin Quarters, keep home your daughters
Cause if bullets fly, watch the flaming
Ignorant ducks are shooting wilding, they're not aiming
One Easter, now I think about it, what a pity
Five people died in front of Skate City
Senseless, back then you was ill if you had a gun
People dashing flashing, damn no fun
Albee Square you couldn't shop too much cause
Fort Greene would hem ya wreck the fuck on up
You had Do or Die, East New York, mad hell
Fellas cutting school trooping to all go Maxwell
So many memories I can't manifest
Yo 'Ru, start where I finish and to Brooklyn, God bless

[Scratched Hook]
"Crazy ass Crooklyn kids"
"Represent the Brooklyn all-nighter"
"Crazy ass Crooklyn kids"
"Because it is, survival of the fittest"
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
Listen cause for your mind I got the right nutrition
We keeps shit hard like fat asses and cases of Heineken
Here in Brooklyn, home of the warrior and villain
Trife type chicks, Top Billin's the anthem
Rastas smoke marijuana
Enterprising businessmen shoot dice on the corner
Excuse me while I light my spliff but some choose to sip
So bullets hit brains, when bottles hit lips
Clips whatever happened to 38 special
Now it's Desert Eagles, government issue
Probably the same one that killed Noriega
Chips that powered nuclear bombs power my Sega
Subliminal hypnotism and colonialism
Leave most niggas dead or in prison
In Crook-land, right hand cuts off the left hand
To spite the hand, jealous of the next man
So violent crimes, black on black plus mad crack to boot
Everybody can't rap, so most hustle and shoot
Make money money, get money, take money
I can't understand that concept cause Jah rules everything around me
Fire burns the unjust like arson larceny
Melt MC's with mental telepathy
With precision, we're slicing and dicing
Peace to the East New York, Perverted Monks, and Mike Tyson

[Scratched Hook x2]

Crooklyn (2X)[Hook: All]
Back to the grill again, the grill again
(Repeat x6)

[Verse 1: MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the car, parked it
Big fat blunts, if you got it then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the 70's and brothers got on grins
Cause they can step to some sisters and say "Slap me some skins
"Honeydip," and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the grill

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewing
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what did you know
SO many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like sasquatch (Not!)
And George Bush gets enough props
Well, anyway, I'mma slay slay lay
Pull a ho around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me a part of history
Kicking em in the grill

[Verse 3: Nas]
Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhoea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that y'all) That y'all, kick em in the grill

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks ?ya naughty? fakes, steady rate h
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of "The Dialect, The Derelict"
The murder licks, Vanilla kicks alive on the crucifix
Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell more record bums
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're humming
The door rings, yo I'm coming
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guiness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gewn to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious
Rapper dapper snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill

[Hook]

[Verse 5: MC Serch]
So here's a true and false, tell me if it's factable
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G I'll put you in a tree like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a bar called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but gave it back cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say "Yeah I fucked your moms"
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill

[Hook]Nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But Robocop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, "What...
Kind of music is this for you to dance to?"
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Or the vile and the nine; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation, sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins
And you're walking
You don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Anyway the shunless one brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done
No time for sleep
Jump in your Jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off yo smash it and trash it
You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise
And just swing it
And party people, sing it

Chorus:
Treat me right
I'll treat you good

Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
"Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
"I'm his number one fan, yes I am"
All these kids realize that I'm the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year, but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all time; ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans I'm never mean
Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene
Always say hello, cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try to play a super star that's hollow
Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens - and plus naked
So we owe them, to pull out your pen
Sign an autograph; you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it

Chorus

Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the man rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ev Lover, Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
Sanity Crystal, my niece
And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace
And leave the guns and have fun; out!
And oh yeah, sing it

Chorus

Break

Well coming back
To nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene with a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map
Cause authority, seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, and definitely lead you right
Just treat me right
Peace

Treat me right
Treat me right
Treat me right[True/Sha]
Hey yo yo yo
Hey chill
Here comes Mr. Large yo

[Mr. Large/Chubb Rock]
Yo what happened to the beat?
Yo Diehard gimme a beat

[Diehard/Biz Markie]
OK boss

[Mr. Large/Chubb Rock](Diehard/Biz Markie)
From East to West, whether your thin or thick
Whether your girl sucks lollis or just pure dick
Mario Puzo said that I'm the don
W-W I'm the shit dot com
The first born, gone, born conceaded
The black Moses, ask me to leave Egypt
Straight heady, I manage heavy, and lolli petty
I gave R. Kelly a Rolex with a diamond bezzy
Rock Steady, beg me, consider me stern
The original hoodlum, Fishburn had to learn
Supersperm, court's adjourn for the ?nollin?
(You, you got what I need)
Let her toss your sald, big hittas love to sit wit big figgas
I love black people, but I can't stand niggas
The ozz heads, back me, I'll cock shoggy
Ready to hold it down, I pop niggas like acne
Pay a token to breathe
Apollo with low creed
For every government nigga, there's government cheese
I'm Mr. Please, Mr. Large
Thirty foot garage
Mercedes beggy
Mad cheddy
Mr. Elly[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
Flatbush born, mingled with the Children of the Corn
Performed, got in the game eight years before Lost in the Storm
Remember St James, Gates and Green, odd hurdle
Got a few chips relocated to Waverly and Myrtle
Model chicks on Willoughby, Fulton is straight Estee Lauder
Spike Lee's up the street, Guru and Primo's up the corner
Easy Mo Bee was being more easy on Clinton
Got my LG niggas with luggage, straight tripping
I think Masta Ace was over there on Lafayette
Daddy-O was in Bed Stuy created the sonic of Stet
In Marcy there was The Jaz while Kane was on Lewis Ave
I'm from Vanderveer where niggas here don't take out the trash
We don't rap for nothing, we're all about hush cash
As a youth with a furrowed brow taking your bus pass
Peace to Star and Buc in Crown Heights with a smoke shop
Or my nigga Freeze in Bushwick with all that Spanish chocha

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Well after coming from a battle KRS won
Not for cash money, all for a charity that the Rev run
Seen DMC coming from EP's MD
Just bought tea, the product G&B from GMC
Hopped on the train, seen Lil' Wayne kick it
For a few minutes he came from the Hieroglyphics exhibit
Down there it's helter skelter, someone bucked shots
It was held at the Galleria by me and the X of Sadat
Dr. Dre arrived too late, someone left with a scratch
One person was maced, another with a scarred face
Corrupt cops began to snoop, questioned slum villagers
The only clue they had was a Timberland, and Daz's Dillinger
Def Squad heard nothing, Royce didn't talk
Described the gunman, 5'9" on the police report
They lied, he had an alibi, drove to Cypress Hill
Where Jalil sold cannabis and ecstacy pills
When the cops rolled up, doors locked, heads fled
Someone said Larry you shot up the spot with the Dead Prez
Pointed to Suave House, ??appoint?? ?????
Saw the cops, Larry's Adidas Shells sped like D12's
Jakes chased, lost him and they tried to get details
They saw Pete Rock, he quickly answered he didn't see L
In Larry's crib, found a safe, no key to the locks
Opened it, there was a bomb, three seconds left on the clock

[Hook]
So there you go, sound like someone you know
Got you thinking he gon' hook you up and help you blow
But then you don't, so now you're broke
Spent time in the studio, lost all your dough
You feeling low, taking your daily throw
Don't recoup that advance then it's them you owe
Without a hot song and you can't get a show
In this business it's not the talent, it's who you know

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
The Supervillain's the name, still in the game, the same biz
What's his face told y'all what the name of the game is
Downtown on the skip-stop, crisp new Timbs
Damage on my corns like flip flops, and who's him?
Rap cats act brave as hell
Get on the mic and turn gangster on some "Yeah, see" like Dave Chappelle
More like Screech, Saved by the Bell
Black man on some "I'm a man's man" man's man name is Shaq Man
Then they get on the first year later
Get their first hater, their first pair of gators
To the perpetrators he's The Unknown Comic
Who spit on the microphone in chunks of thrown vomit
It's just a shame, bust this aim
Lust for fame crushed his frame, like what's his name
And whatchamacallit remind him of Mini-Me
With Minnie Mouse in Gucci from her coochie to her skinny knee
Like thirteen earthlings, Cool Hand Luke
Who dropped jewel and influence the youth like Buk
All he do is puke and he in need of a speedy line
He said "every rhyme I mastermind like Se' Divine"
You greedy swine, don't eat pork
In the Streets of New York you out of place like Mork
From Ork, dork, Paul pop the cork
Drop me in Newark airport, I'm supposed to meet Björk
But what's all the fuss about? Hush up your big mouth
I sent her out to see Grimm to bust him out the big house
Yup, see that's how rumors get started
A certified older cat who don't get carded
DOOM could write a rhyme on demand
And get money as if he had time on his hands
And when he not in the lab doing flows and vocals
He out in the streets throwing bones with the locals
Never underestimate the next man's thirst
It could be way far worse than a whole jar of Starburst
Mmmm, he keeps those by the pound load
Emcees run from common locations like download
I think it's rather spectacular
How they come out they neck, bite and suck like Dracula
In case you just tuned in, once again
We're here with the Supervillain, known as hip hop's Gunga Din[Verse One - Hotdog]
Aiyyo ??, I got the batter, get the mixer
As the trickster will fix ya a batch of rhymes
You know that soothes, like an elixir
And sticks your ribs so let the cheese and wine
Or rather wine and cheese
Cause I aim to please with ease hope the crowd sees
That I'm, the man that loves to flam
And when I step into a jam I just slam like Jordan
And this is the world, accordin to me
The capital-H-the-O-the-T, the-D-the-O-the-G
Rockin, heavenly hype and ?? steadily
When I come in to rock'n'roll, I'm sure you will agree
That I got a hype type of style a family
But Diggy Doc gave it to Rob to rock and Howie Tee
Now, I'm talkin about Omega Psi Phi fraternity
Givin a little history
For some people, their lucky number's 7
For Q-Dogs, it's 1911
November 17th, underneath the ceilings
Behind the walls of Thirkield Hall

[Verse Two - ?]
This is a family affair, rather a gathering of the brothers
United we stand, we're not divided like the others
And when I mention the word divided, you know what I'm meaning
Show a brother something they don't have they start fiending
First the ear-grabbin, then the back-stabbin
This from brothers that I call friends, I'm not havin
The other negative things in a friendship
An occasional whipser, gossip, a loose lip
I once trusted a brother with an eyeful
He told the next man, cause he's livin trifle
But now I'm not worried cause I'm part of a family
United til death simply cause we choose to be
An occasional joke, a diss, or a crowd pleaser
Callin your moms a ?? look-a-like skeezer
Whoever wins the diss battle, respect is given
Fightin over words is not how we are livin
Then there's ?? word I almost forgot
Three-on-one, no heat, but the rumor's still hot
The bro's get a ho that you know is totally widdit
There's no need to be discrete cause you know she won't admit it
When I think back on the memories
Just like these - is it a wonder that I love the 80's

[Verse Three - Rob Swinga]
Well I'm Rob, a.k.a. as the Swinga
Comedic at times, and a stone-cold thriller
I got somethin to say I'll make it short and sweet
Me I'm the Swinga I'ma swing it to this beat
Now I talk to a lot of people with the large vocabulary
Colloquial language I'll use that's secondary
And then there is slang and I would use that third
And I'll say outrageous things that might sound absurd
But - right back into my large vocabulary
I'm the type of guy that'll always be primary
Never secondary, to any adversary
If they want to be like me, on the contrary
They try to compete, but I will always delete
I'll leave them cryin from the agony, of defeat
And when they try to return to repeat
I make them hold on peace signs, say "Swinga I retreat"

[Verse Four - Chubb Rock]
Well the Toad is immensely strong on the instrumental
The lyric can hit and shock the pure metal
Chubb Rock has a weak spot, creatin
An iron maiden cannot pierce my skin when I hit top 10
Run for shelter, cause you're gonna fear this tune
More than you feared the age of Helter Skelter
Watch how we behave, Diggity Dog and Dave
The Roadrunner and Swinga always sayin that smegma
Is the product of ten intense games of balls under balls
I have Professor Paul's
Kicking ability, the Snake's agility
The ricochet speed of the Centipede
And the devilish mind of the Scorpion
The Lizard is unrealistic and simplistic
And loitering is prohibit, the tune is illiterate
Diggy Doc no, Ed Lover forever my brothers in crime
They watch my back at the drop of a dime.. when we climb
And work and work hard and struggle to stay alive
And strive, the Venoms, the Five - check this out..
The Roadrunner

[Outro]
Yo Chubbs can we make a little gravy and shit
Can we get ours, whassup man?
Niggas is takin caravans all the way to North Carolina n shit
Whassup wit dat shit?  Niggas don't respect my situation
Yo can we make a little gravy chief, whassup?[Verse 1]
Bundle up my whole style is so cold
I glow like old guys who go bald
My flow got no front in the vocal
Your flow got no button it's so old
I don't mean to sound like a showboat
But it's true my persona's no joke
I stepped into some kinda portal
I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble
I'm from the most risky zone, oh
No place is more shitty global
More pistols, Russian revolvers
We shootin' all that is normal
But it ain't just because we want to
We ain't got nowhere we can run to
Somebody please press the undo
They only teach us the things that guns do

[Hook]
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

[Verse 2: Chubb Rock]
Rock, you know my era
B-boy seasoning, Salt-n-Pepa
Grown and sexy, come with the extra
Crushed up linen, fly like Cessna
This type brew, I gave it birth
Now it's time again to give it a verse
Jamaican born, not a fan of the ganja
Boulevard, Brooklyn to Somalia
And it goes in the background
Playa, that is my sound
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
Pioneer legend and they call me Mr. Rock
No B word or N word, I don't need those words
Respect for hers
The game dried up, so we come with the grease
Leadin' ya right and treatin' ya right, so peace

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Superman is known by the locals
As this dude who's so fly it's global
Attitude that came outta struggle
Destitute but I make it hopeful
You real but my real is tenfold
My real will make yours a rental
Gangsta if at ease, essential
Fight with guns or utensils
So bold, nothing's confidential
Breakfast was not continental
And lunch could not compliment all
We still become competent souls
These streets ain't paved with no gold
Matter fact someone stole the light pole
Nobody fat enough for lypo
They don't teach us to read and write, so

[Hook]Four out of.. ten murders.. are love related
Keep your 'ood, in-a your pants
And dese tings won't 'appen to you
Check out da bwoy-a-story

[Chubb Rock]
Tell him!  Excuse me, I beg your pardon
Inform him, that Chubb is playin in your secret garden
Cause he didn't cut - the lawn, correctly
I have a green thumb, you're not dumb, that's why you sweat me
You wanna have your cake and eat it too, so do I
You're sneaking around, we're sneaking around, so why
Do you wanna continue, comin to every venue
You don't tell him, I'll offend you
This ain't right so put him down on the scoop
That you're a blow-up sex doll for every group
Where are the footsteps that you followed
Tippy-toed to my crib and did me a solid
You answered every question I ever had
On the female anatomy - after you sat on me
Cheating is more serious than the Taking of Pelham
So tell him, before I tell him

If Mary had told her boyfriend
Like she was supposed to, none of this would be happening

[Chubb Rock]
Tell him!  His feelings, you disregard
You took his credit card, went on the boulevard
You bought me shirt after shirt with his hard-earned work
You treat him like dirt
My conscience said to me, "Yo Chubbs you better be
Careful, she gave you the keys to his Cherokee
Jeep - but I don't wanna go six feet deep
In the dirt for some skirt"
I was gonna cut her off but the stuff was kinda dope
The dope even paid my car note, nope
I'm gonna let her go yet until I get
This girl can really get me out of financial debt, huh
So I chill, passion kills, tears spilled
On an innocent grill then overspilled
The guilt, stuck in my chest so I suggest
That you tell him, maybe you can start off fresh
Cheating is more serious than the taking of pellum(?)
So tell him, before I tell him

If Mary had told her boyfriend
Like she was supposed to, none of this would be happening

[Chubb Rock]
Here's one more bang for the road - uhh
Never again will you explode
Like this you might miss the imprint of my fist
Embedded in the bed by your head
"Don't leave me Chubb, don't leave me Chubb," she screamed
"I got access to all of his green
I lust for your pelvic thrust so why don't you trust
Don't fuss, he'll never find out about us"
But baby, I can't see you no more and..
{*knocking*} .. let me see who's at the door

{*door creaks*}
Yo who are you?
Who me?  You don't know man?
Why I'm gonna shoot ya
{*machine gun fire*}

If Chubbs had kept his prick in his pants
Like he was supposed to, none of this would have happened[Hook: All]
Back to the grill again, the grill again
(Repeat x6)

[Verse 1: MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the car, parked it
Big fat blunts, if you got it then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the 70's and brothers got on grins
Cause they can step to some sisters and say "Slap me some skins
"Honeydip," and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the grill

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewing
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what did you know
SO many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like sasquatch (Not!)
And George Bush gets enough props
Well, anyway, I'mma slay slay lay
Pull a ho around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me a part of history
Kicking em in the grill

[Verse 3: Nas]
Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhoea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that y'all) That y'all, kick em in the grill

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks ?ya naughty? fakes, steady rate h
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of "The Dialect, The Derelict"
The murder licks, Vanilla kicks alive on the crucifix
Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell more record bums
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're humming
The door rings, yo I'm coming
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guiness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gewn to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious
Rapper dapper snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill

[Hook]

[Verse 5: MC Serch]
So here's a true and false, tell me if it's factable
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G I'll put you in a tree like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a bar called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but gave it back cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say "Yeah I fucked your moms"
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill

[Hook][Verse 1]
Here we go
[ Chubb Rock ]
I arrive from the steps of Sinai cause I'm fly
When you're high from the lye
You see me mingle in the sky
The dim light superceeds the street cock fight
Straight heterosex, but I still Dick Van, your dyke
From the mic flip, metronome time skip, who will high-ship
The Brooklyn-based scholar and them niggas past Islip
And ooh-ooh, I curse you with that Fugee-la voo doo
Will do you like Italian deli kids slicing prosciutto
I barb you like Bobbito, the airport, right through Heathrow
Release murder niggas like Ito
Pure hatred, cause he picked who he picked to mate with
Then laced it, bourgeois player two-faced it
Hey, revamp the swing to parlay
How black power went sour, where's Brother Jay
Where's the pink Cadillacs protected by whoever
The red and the black, green, Hilfiger nigga
Indians wanna protect the Lone Howling Chief
So kids create beef

[Hook]
Back in the days when we had nothin but beef
At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids when they have beef, you might die
Why

[ Skoob ]
While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that
I'm with my soldiers in the Rover, never sober, fuck that
Yo dun, I run with wild Crooklyn niggas with gats
Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack
My niggas click back kid, that's why we hold something
And break your punk ass down just like you stole something
When I rock with Chubb your block show me love
Nigga what, want beef, we drawing first blood

[Verse 3: Krazy Drazy]
Well, it's the riggedy-rhyme dropper, the hip-hopper, you know the name
I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefing in the game)
You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet
Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit
The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight
We wiggedy-wildin out, proving all these white folks right
We like some crabs in a barrel tryin to get on top
The Hit Squad, Chubb Rock represent hip-hop
So kill the beef

[Hook]

[Verse 4: PMD]
Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988
I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state
Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminating flows
Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes
Jealous niggas, gun triggers, fucking up the game
But me you can't tame an outlaw like Jesse James
We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest
Who's the best, but let it rest because there's no contest
Temptation, accusations need to stop
Unify hip-hop, PMD, Chubb Rock

[Verse 5: Chubb Rock]
Now - I will come back to the groove
Now my man Common on wax slayin Ice Cube, anyway, that's cool
That nigga somewhere higher learning
And of course there's that famous beef between Parrish and Sermon
And that's cool, both those niggas killed Jane
And now there's Nice without Smooth, that's insane
And I heard they squashed that and that shit should cease
Cause black mutha-uckas shouldn't beefYeeeeah, haaaa
Chubb Rock
L.E.N.S
One Time

[Verse 1]

Ther is no other big hip speeker
I'm the final mix time tweeker
My fosil blowin your speeker (rooown)
Kids fed me like hienas
I been drum slap stands like when Ike did the Tina
And no gel either, no force to ????? a bomb
Misdomeanor and goes faster then a cheetah
The rap concepts cause fear, you don't have to go home
But you have to get the hell out the here
And yeah blunteds and rebums must pair
The dun gridy donna in drinch with gear
And the obvious sench hence with ??????
The news writer stating that the flow is over ah-ah
The best school leader, the destenied plan with a preacher
Greatness when I flow throug to ya urethra
The beat and the rhyme will peep to critique
When my cow jumps over your moon, don't sleep

[Hook]

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

[Verse 2]

From the minds of Minolta
From the press play boster
From the average Jack wack crackheads with Oprah
As from safe sex with rubbers
As for rapper turnin' mothers
As for exec's on the covers as for million march brothers
Shu-boo
The fair for my new scare-crow
You haven't been scared since I first heard the Wu
The beat well grinded, the rhyme ??????
In the future there's another new world criminal minded
And hallelujah kids hear this
The death kiss will exist your mix and his
The movement of the rational hip hop radical
The beef between foes was labeled practical
And ragional the ????? spell did sell
It made positive icons start to rebell
For the doe, not a flow when you check ??????
???? street soul to the lowest riddle
You creep don't sleep

[Hook]

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

[Verse 3]

Now here we go

Vocal booth I get on ???? with the truth
Loosin my tooth and get ready for the lyrical juice
Starts to pour hardcore rule ?????
G-Man Lp's gonna sell more then a whore
I'm certain and through the soundscan man I'm smirkin
Buyers are gonna run they don't like Levar Burton
I light shit up like uncle Fester
You wanna see me use your retina
I'm laughing at your skills like Fren Dresner
The beats like elastic the groove well crafted
I wanna be the best I told Nes to pick a classic
It's so erratic how easy it is to create static
The rude is demographic it's hard to be democratic
I've had it it's allmost time for the new word order
Watch your sons and daughters
Don't sleep

(Ooooooooooooh)

Don't sleep

[Hook]

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

Don't sleep

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

Don't sleep

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

Don't sleep

*woman harmonizing till end*[Chubb Rock]
High sprung with the beat and the groove is sweet licorice
Whether you're white-ish, redneck-ish or (?) figureish
Whether you speak real good, or you just st-st-stammer
You a city hood or you're just country bammer
When, afraid our records would hit the top ten
But they're illin with the shillings makin sum dead yen scorn
Born, break up Zulu dawn
Whether Big Apple, N.Y. straight to Californ'
Or Miami Beach, swing bassed up the hoochie
If you sample George Clint', you praise crazed Bootsy
Or the J.R., Texas kids with the hee-haw
And the DJ kids cut {*scratch*}
It's strictly hip-hop, one two you don't stop
It's Chubb Rock with the Chubb, and with the Rawwwwwwwwk!
Testin the waters a bit
Cause I don't understand all this East/West bullshit

[Hook]
East vs. West, one contest
Let's see what rap kid rocks shit the best
East vs. West, one contest
Let's see what producer produce shit the best
East vs. West, one contest
Let's see what rap kid rocks shit the best
East vs. West, that's nonsense
Let's go on the ninety-six Fresh Fest

[Chubb Rock]
Whether it's he say or she say, they say or I say
If you believe in Ali, or you call him Cassius Clay
If you're gold or platinum if those, metals don't happen
We're, all up in this peace rappin, no hands clappin
Until me done when the simple tone turns into a hum
Praise to D.M.C., I might need help from Reverand Run
If you boast to each coast, and you test who's the best
Thank God Jehovah, Allah and Buddha bless
People, no sequel cause I might be dead next week
And after next week I can't turn the other cheek
This against that, high against the - hat
Black against black that is wack against wack
I've seen the promised land so the earth don't faze me
So, I should diss my brother and let the white man pay me - nah
I'll try to test the waters a bit
Cause I don't understand all this East/West bullshit

[Hook]

[Chubb Rock]
Whether it's.. or..
Whether it's.. or..
Whether you think Magic Johnson still has the Magic
Or when Michael Jordan left basketball it was tragic
If Pat rules the Knicks or feel Rodman is a freak
If we don't stick together we'll be up shit's creek people
After the single there might be a sequel level
And what we can't solve we'll leave for the Devil
Me myself I don't care who's to blame
If the shit don't cease, we'll all have the same name
You can say fuck it, or have two quarters in the bucket
If you're folding sheets, or you're folding pure nuggets
(?) If you get a record deal or a publishing deal
Whether you're aneroxic or you have sex appeal
(?) Whether you're food stampin, jackin a mansion
Whether you live in Compton or you chill in East Hampton
(?) Whether it's weed or blow, your wife or your ho
I don't care if you mailroom'n or you CEO
You're still a nigga..[Chubb Rock]
Enjoy ya self cause life is too short
Everybody dismantle your shotty
Your nine millimeter needs to take a long breather
For the white black jewish koreans need to
Grab a neighborhood skirt, go to a concert
Scream for Chubb while I rip up the club
The rhythm of the vibe was alive and you felt it
Your girl is provacative, you take her home and pelt it
And after the pelt, she feels like a cheddar melt
Just play it cool, and just..

Chorus: {sung}

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself, and just enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself, and just enjoy yourself

[Chubb Rock]
Chubb is not a party animal
But when it comes to a jam, I have the plan like Hannibal
Smith - I don't take a draw from no spliff
The scene of the beam doesn't redeem and if
I wanna get high, I just fly
Walk up to a cutie, and say, "Hi..
When I wake up tomorrow, are you gonna be next to me?"
She's confused, but she sweats me
I wear my galoshes so I can protect myself
Carry yours G, if you just wanna..

Chorus

[Chubb Rock]
People used to say that I was a fuddy-duddy
Only used to care about how to make money
Up from the Hamptons to Flushing Meadows
Decorated by an Art Deco
My nickname was "The One"
Now "The One" was the only one who didn't have fun
But no more, goin buckwild on the tour
Keepin people in stitches on the floor
Clark Kent and Tracie thought I was spacy
The funniest in the nation laughed for the duration
Don't play yourself cause yourself needs a good self
And just, {enjoy your..}

Chorus

{singers}
Enjoy yourself
.. and just enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
.. and just enjoy yourself

Chorus (1/2 to fade)[Verse One]
Here we go, ha ha
Thou shalt not have no other great one but me
Transcribin my lyrics is the C-H-U-B
The lyrics that you hear is not his but mine
While, biblical words don't need to ra-hyme
I said, "Let there be a light," and there was light
And the breeze (?), like that kid who made "I-Ight"
But men took mad dominion, over men
Hard bondage with backs and, knees that must bend
But only in prayer, I make your head need Ibuprof'/Bayer
Call me, the number one player
But hey.. the one pharoahes, parlayed
In the land of Egypt, when that slave shit behaved
Bythia(?) drew me, from the Nile to smile on the people
After me there will be a sequel
And I'll praise my name, in the jam
Call me what you want, but I am what I am

[Verse Two]
Hehe, I live in the souls of men, and women
And pilgrims and children who wiggle, to the rhythm
Just go, the people have corrupted themselves
They toke the devil's smoke, puffing their L's
I'll send, my only son down, to bless you
And observe how you know him, and that will test you
Years, of sufferation, will burn the nation
With adultery, skirt-chasin and crotch-blazin
You never learn - look how many times I kilt ya
I burnt ya, I drowned ya, I froze ya
I stripped your land and destroyed ya culture
Next time you better give me some
R-E-S-P-E (C-T) now hold ya but I love ya
I invented AIDS but also, invented the rubber
Each one teach one brother
Take my name in vain and you're gone like damn
Call me what you want, but I am what I am

[Verse Three]
Ha ha
Now you got light skin, dark skin, East coast, West coast
Old school, new school, dumb-ass fools
One land, one people, I am the one
Figure you disobeyed so I made the word "nigger"
You can change the diction, but can't change what I'm writin
I script those Pulitzer books for that kid, Michael Crichton
Like {*tch tch tch*} I am the hi-hat
I am the M-I-C, I am Easy Mo Bee
And Easy Mo is me, he gets down when I want him to get down
I put the heights in the crown
I wrote the dead sea scrolls, I'm "Strictly Business"
I made Erick and Parrish go gold
My crew is tan, darker than tan, I made the Ku Klux Klan
I made Rush +Def+ but, able to +Jam+
I'm flam, and I'm intricate
You must and should be a fan and I am what I am

[Verse Four]
The praise of the "Goodfella" is long past done
DeNiro's an actor, on cue, totin a gun
ACTION! Forty-five colt bolt, it gets messy
Then copycat murders flow to Joe Schmoe Pesci
Then the ladies, sex, to the break of dawn and
Another quaalude, and she'll love me in the mornin
Fast pace, "Scarface," you can't win, God's race
When you're sparkin Noah's Ark, and you're in God's place
Baby - cock up your foot and you act crazy
Every "Distinguished Gentleman" wants a lady
You can't bug, when you wanna play real life cocoa
When you're "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" with Oprah
"Mi Vida Loca," and then it turns to weed smokers
Then you're dead, dealin with them kids from +cosa nostra+
But no autographs you must, already be a fan
I am what I am and that's all that I am{You know you ought to, slow down..}

[Chubb Rock]
For my, introduction in eighty-six I was lethal
Rockin for the grassroots and up keep the people
The movement of the bowel from that lay shit of the vowel
Mad share yeah, from Mr. Mufasa with the growl
The party's mad dead until I care to appear
Kids wanna know where the hell I been for the past year
No beer or no parka Nike gear no wear or tear
The new mic holder who causes, any fair
Some max and relax then mellow then strive
Shock-value MC's goin platinums with lies
The neophytic critics, who need big bats to hit it
They zone with the metronome clone to dome split it
When I joke around like Zog, rename them is like fog
I can flow digital, though my style is analog
I, base my career upon these years of how I've strived
Three years gone but I will survive, ha

Ha ha, ha ha
Now this "East vs. West," one contest was a taste
"Crooklyn Dodgers" and that libation, touched the fan base
A little, always scared in the place I scare any new rival
Past years missin dissin scripting up this new bible
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican or some black nigga who's peakin
The lyrics are abundant, dirty fat blue beats are pungent
And now we gotta see how hot, will the son get
I'm a lyrical defamer, like Gloria I'm a Gaynor
In the music biz I opened up more doors than Kramer
My anthology's available, so buy up the archive
Three years gone but I will survive

For the duration..
Overzealous inhabitants flock with abundance
Paying tribute, to the one the circumfrence
Of the stadium, is paying homage, to my cranium
The sea of heads doesn't seem to hide the lady
In the back row, waving her hands for the ohh
The usual crowd rock line for a show
And I dispense with the usu-al, and keep it coastin
To boom up the set my advice is take a motion
Before you walk through the door, of a Chubb Rock tour
Buy the anthology in any store
Frontin, now we'll have ya, tougher than mutton
If I touch your button you'll start kick like Charles Dutton
Lyrics persevere and you really must strive
Three years gone but I will survive
I.. I.. I will will, survive, now ho!

You know it G
First of all let's make it clear, I'm a strong young man
Takin' no shorts ya see, yeah
So if you plan on makin' waves, it's just a waste of time
You should face reality, yeah (check this out)
I don't want you to think that I'm, afraid or shy (uh-uh)
Naive I will never be (you know it G)
I just want a friend so I can hold her hand
Come on baby, and get with me, yeah

CHORUS:
Just ask me to
I'll be with you
And hug, so much fun again
If you walk with me
I'll walk with you
And hug, you're my special friend

Forget, those people talking trash (Forget about it, baby)
Just jet off and escape
Girl, it's not too late (It ain't too late, it's not too late)
Baby, take Tevin by the hand
I'm sure you'll understand
Lady, this is fate
Don't be afraid (T.C. one time now)

I'm not here to goof around (so zero that thought, heh)
You should understand that, G (aww yeah, baby)
You can make all the type of waves that you want
But I won't let you play yourself, no not with me, yeah

Don't be afraid
We've got it made, we're young
It feels so good
To know we have room to grow

[Chubb Rock]
Check it out
Yo check check, Atomic Tevin, I know you really feel like
You're in heaven your grill's a 7 and your bio reads 11 (14, G!)
If you really wanna see, don't pretend
To be all cute, she knows you got loot
Not Al B. can convince me that you're naive
The squabs will perceive..
.. your position, rationalize who you are
Tevin Campbell, get souped, you're a star
She said, "Can you tell me where we're going to?"
To my crib for a few
Don't get sexual, sexual means "half"
If she's on that program
That's what your staff is for
She mighta been around the world and I I I I (what?)
You might find your baby, and if not
You can come to my crib, I'm Chubb Rock, peace
(Peace)

[Tevin Campbell]
REPEAT CHORUS

Break it down..
Ay, yo, I'm in here G!
Cause I'm the T to the E to the V to the I to the N, baby

Forget, those people talking trash (Forget about it, baby)
Just jet off and escape
Girl, it's not too late (It ain't too late, it's not too late)
Baby, take Tevin by the hand (Take me by my hand)
I'm sure you'll understand (You'll understand, you'll understand)

Chubb Rock comin back hard for nineteen nine-TY!
Word up, word up
Kick this out to my man Rob Swinga, Hot Dog Dinky
Manager (?) Ev Lover y'knahmsayin? Dr. No, here we go..

[Verse One]
It's the Hitman, yes the Hitman, yo ya know it
The thirst quencher, the man on the sequencer
He was scared to kick a sixteen bar, he's not a rap star
Not saying that I am, but I'm the jam
I'm going to kick a little not a Dr. Suess riddle
No cats in hats, fox in some socks
But to the DJ jocks check your clocks
Half past what? Time to bust nut
Not a pistachio; he uses a Casio keyboard
And a Tascam board
To kick in the P-50, get nifty
Born with the gift, time to get riffed
Not with the manufacturing of a spliff
He never rolled one; never sold none
The beats give me the high that brought fame to us
And, how we gonna kick it, How?
(Just the two of us!)

[Verse Two]
Chubb has been dope since he came out the shaft of his pops' wood
Yes I'm (*good!*)
Yo he shouted and he plopped into the uterus
And they knew this about me; was gonna be a dope MC
When I get on the mic my windpipe strikes and ignites
A lyric when you hear it you fear it and like
Chubb is not a man to get souped like Campbell
I'm the man with the plan and my jam sells
Like a whore, in the store, hardcore and more
On the tour makin money you never saw
I don't like dreaming, never ever beam and
Never involved with girls like like scheming
Or skiing or toboggan sledding, cause I'm shredding
Any thoughts of a wedding, so Helen, Keller
Listen to the rules and
Me and Hitman Howie Tee is all about coolin
She went buckwild, screamed, yelled, hollered
I told her I loved her and then she did a solid
Did it real good like a nice girl should
Back polish waxed up the hood
Yo Hitman Howie Tee you should have seen her on me
She got all Vanessa Del Rio on me
But after she slept cause I had nothin left
On the Martin Butler tip, yes half step
But yo cousin Howie Tee and me
Our love is all about making a dope LP
That will crush and sell and bum rush
Don't hush, how we gonna do it How?

(Chorus)
Keep control...

(Tragedy the Intelligent Hoodlum)
When I made arrest the president, America ate me
Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me
They labeled me a prejudice poet
I'm speaking the truth as I know it
I hold on but it's hard for me to handle
Too much lies, corruption and scandal
Cops want to kill a brother or two
Who do you call when the gang wears blue
I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man
My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger
I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer
Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor
Mali troops will run through your resident
In my hand will be the head of your president
All you fess that made a check to throwdown
Will rise up for a political showdown

Chorus

(King Tee)
Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip
Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip
Of the ropes and chains that kept us
Since we were black they didn't want to except us
But it's ok, I got my own plan
Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program
The natives cook, wash and clean
And to the rubbers that throw in the scene
M-A-N-D-E-L-A
Now you got a chance to hear what he say
Since they kept him locked up for so long
Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong
But we need to all stand together though
And let the red, black and green show
Become aware of yourself before it gets too late
Another message from King Tee the great

Chorus

(Grand Puba)
Yo bust it
Hung wit the flip, got a ?dooby? wig
Now she thinks she's all that shit, her man got zits
Hon living lovely, Miss Gouchi
Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends
Ugn, miss quick fast in a heedy
Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy
Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids
And the man caught a nice thick bitch
Now the bitch is on skid
Screaming how she hates her kids
The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy
Think slick, she better get wit the wick
Cause foul, foul, foul is your style
You tried to run the race but you lost by a mile
See it everyday, it's the same old sorry song
How long must this go on

Chorus

(Def Jef)
Power now or never, together forever
And ever, sever make it endever
To enlight your brother when
I recommend to extend a hand
Expand it then wish strength to fend
Black women and men from the white power structure
They stucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya
And you gave birth to a nation
You freelabel laid America's economic foundation
Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years
But now here was a peer to give you shift in the gears
The turn of the tables, knowledge and ables
Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels
And years of classroom fables, fiction
Fallacies all sorts and fabrications
?For sarge? even fuss
Star Spangled story, stigma and stunts

Chorus

(Chubb Rock)
I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen
And knowing his father slowing
And his mother is hoeing
And now should he be growing
He's too young to be sewing
He should just chill and be flowing
I know he was being malested and sold
And his mom for being infected
Never check it, so I invested
My time and made sure little bro was looked at
Pops got evicted, not a smack
Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless?
The bum got done by the one
And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip
Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip
It confuses and bent ill thoughts
In the soul of the youngster
Is daddy a monster
That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain
Drys and open your eyes for the insane

Chorus[Serch] Aiyyo Pete, it's Chubbs
[Chubb] Sup G?
[Serch] Yo Pete
[Nice] Yo Serch
[Serch] You know people tryin to gel us right?
Try to gel
[Chubb] Yeah dat
[Serch] So you know we gotta we gotta rip this
[Chubb] Serch let's go kick that shit G
Drop it right here
[Serch] Right here, like an asshole
[Chubb] One two
[Serch] One two, ya don't stop

[MC Serch]
Grooves get kicked as Serch tries to flip like coins
Pain, like the foot to groins
3 Strikes but I didn't gel the head yet
Why you still vexed over things I haven't even said yet
Yo Pete, put you part-time like temps
Scale like a fence, put you in the past tense
You tried speedin but you ain't fast enough to chase me
So what I did this, ?? bring the kit to Ben Casey
And don't waste time
Dopest tracks, so why you gonna waste rhymes?
I absorb like a sponge in the bozack
I'm trifle, get the rifle, or I step back and crack slugs
And my crew give pounds and hugs
Tugs on my shirt, let me know that I'm still pro-fessional
And at the end of the session, you'll know
That the 3rd'll disturb the verb with the noun
Shift the sound, so GET UP AND GET DOWN, Serch'll never stand still
Try to flam I'll be like Claude Van Damme and just kick em in the grill

{"Kick em in the grill.."} {"3rd Bass"}
{"Kick em in the grill.."} {"I'm Chubb Rock"}
{"Kick em in the grill.."} {"Serch!"}
{"Kick em in the grill.. grill.. grill Pete!"}

[Pete Nice]
?? like a camel to ??
Missin the points of ?? spliffs
If you wanna gamble, let it flow
I ain't Al Jolson and Sambo
Low like a buddhist sniffin ? tree
But that booty fat bass it ain't movin me
To be or not to be on, your FM
Step to the AM, the gimmicks, I'll play em
I say em while I'm takin 40 swigs
A Chinaman eats with two twigs
Called your numbed, 9-7-0 PISS
Goodfella, you can tell you're on my hitlist
For this I stick like a splinter
Play ya like a sphincter cause my title's Minister
Serch said kick em, I gas em and trick em
Rhymes like ??, now Chubb, stick em

[Chubb Rock]
Jump jump with the man with the plan, Chubb Rock
You know, a judo, a chop chop chop
From stereo monarch rationalize the grammar
It's like that and ah.. and ih.. ih.. if I stammer
Or sa-st-stutter, english found in the gutter
Or the sewer, while I talk like Pete Puma
How many lumps do you want inside your coffee?
Isn't about time, isn't about time, you stepped off me?
Yo Chubb - are you the best, are you the one
That ?? large chest, well, nevertheless my
Finger won't do the walkin through cleavage
I got a girl of my own, she's at home
Chubb is not conceited, I'm convinced of the fact
Vanilla sold seven million copies of some shit that was wack
He can wrap, his lips around a big black cock
He needs no more pressed, let me stop
Cherry crusaders, clean clairvoyany concepts
Claiming critical conversations that came in..to view
Of 3rd Bass mixed with Chubb Rock until
We kick the motherfucker in his, umm
G-R-I-L-L-L, word up that's the grill

[MC Serch]
Chill!
Hold up, Chubbs, you got lifted
{Word up} What's the science?I walk down the street, yo pick any one
I see a little ruffneck kid with a gun
I said, "Little homeboy what's up with the Glock 19?"
He said a damn crack fiend just went and took his mama's life
And now the kid's over there smoking the pipe
I said, "Guilt will let him know what he did
And you don't need to go to jail, you're just a kid
Give me the gun little G, just cool it down
You've got a lot to live for you're college bound."
And so he screams and cries, we start huggin
On the corner in Ft. Greene, we're buggin
Tears drip as we walk to the crib
And I'mma try to be there to comfort the kid
I woke up it's a brand new day
Little man blew himself away
And I'm scorned, an emotional thorn
And I'm lost in the storm

Well back in the hood, understood, I mean understand
The conspiracy upon the first man
Death to the Klan pump the fists that's connected
To the elbow joined by cartilage to the dark hand
And the plan to conserve this confused violent land
Different races, faces share the same spaces
Sewed by arrogant laces
Taste this peach its real, real sweet
Extra reasoning seasoning to the weak
Will be done before the sun starts to nova
Or we'll be over
Reveal the passion button now hit it
Cause no one is born a bigot
Delete what you have engraved in your mind
And throw up the peace sign
And maybe be reborn or be lost in the storm

Well it's ninety-two we will make it to ninety-three
With no P-E, A-C-E
It won't happen so stop your damn finger tappin
Find the music of peace and start rappin
The answer lies in your hearts then your minds
And maybe then we can save human kind
Put away the guns and have fun was a strong motto in ninety-one
But a Woodstock ninety-two the many join the few to delete the racist crew
Without death cause that will be illogical
Peace will cover every newspaper article
So now then, where do we start
Everybody knows they have to play a part
Open your minds and clear your minds
And throw up the peace signs
Cause to scorn, be reborn, everybody let's be reborn
Or be lost in the storm[True/Sha]

From East to West, whether your thin or thick
Whether your girl sucks lollis or just pure dick
Mario Puzo said that I'm the don
W-W I'm the shit dot com
The first born, gone, born conceaded
The black Moses, ask me to leave Egypt
Straight heady, I manage heavy, and lolli petty
I gave R. Kelly a Rolex with a diamond bezzy
Rock Steady, beg me, consider me stern
The original hoodlum, Fishburn had to learn
Supersperm, court's adjourn for the ?nollin?
(You, you got what I need)
Let her toss your sald, big hittas love to sit wit big figgas
I love black people, but I can't stand niggas
The ozz heads, back me, I'll cock shoggy
Ready to hold it down, I pop niggas like acne
Pay a token to breathe
Apollo with low creed
For every government nigga, there's government cheese
I'm Mr. Please, Mr. Large

For those who don't know the name
Or can't distingush the rame
It's the legendary Chubbsta who was arround when Jane
Was arround Eric and P
For something on that LIE homie
The bass of A Tribe Called Quest with
Hip-hop at that time was mentaly older
Had lyrical soldiers, KRS was the holder of the bolders
The mortals of Latin Quarter had no time for nickle and dimes
We need to go on +Great Adventures+ with Ricky D rhymes
I'm the biggest fan of this rougish gonra
Exec's will con ya while the regiments will be on you to harm ya
If you disrespect the microphone on check
Put 'em in a yoke and snap his neck and rip a 60 minute set
I will arive before the sampagne wishes
The caviar dishes

Getting stoped, it kills me but it was the birth of Mr. Rock-Rock

......in the hearse of themes
For a positive verse at this point I settle for one lace with a curse
All eyes are blue to the one that acts rod
Brilliant deep rooted talents somehow gets mold
Can I tackle this beast to ass
To calm the savage beast is a simple tentask
I am the best thing since sliced wheat bread
The anger in my-am turns graffit to led
We're on
Script nothing but black thought
Educated ghetto street want to meet me
Pure knowledge the sense flows through the smirkings
Touch my hand you start to shape like
I am what I am and what I am is the man
Never take it in vain but my man....but damn
I'm the lyrical all that hits the BS
Can't stop it bores me
And they call me Mr. Rock-Rock-Rock ya don't stop

This is the 5th LP and this big kid is still alive
He is the shit like Windows 95 sharp like a zip drive
I've brought my tounge and its high sprung ego
Everywhere he go, we go, you know
I am still in tune with the rhythm
Clinton in the prez' but I voted for Sherly Chizm
The memory is erratic it snaps like elastic
Rap needs no doctor though some of the members are pedeatrican
That is fantastic it leaves room for adults
Crate diggers, beat freaks or lyrical goats
And I'm all three, it's me three time fold
The some of the parts must equal the whole
And some are measuring their words with nothing but gold
And platinum trinkets for those who sold
Is it the true art form or you can form for the not
I'm the artist of the year
And they call me Mr. Rock-Rock-Rock you don't stop

Intro: BizMarkie

C'mon
Break it down
Rarrraaaahahhhh!!
What happened? C'mon!!
What happened?? Ahhrrrahhh!!
Rrrrah!
Now we got me
My man Chubb Rock over this Prince Paul beat
Yo Chubb you start it off we gonna freak it
C'mon

Verse One: Chubb Rock

Here we go
To the consumer, and the kids who drop rumors
For the man who sport, Timberland and dash suede Pumas
I, come backwards on stuff you don't deny
If you try to act fly then I'll, punk you I and I
When, I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
Turn to bourgeoise, to invade the media, shame
Take it insult, call me, the Grape Ape
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
Ate, every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica
I like Spike Lee's a kind of sporty 40 Acre
I gotta have it, O.J., he gotta stab it
Stop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid, the drug addict
If you missed me, don't kiss me with the tongue
Soon to come is my man BizMark the one

Verse Two: BizMarkie

La-dah-di, la-dah-da, I like to say
You know me, as the inhuman orchestra
When you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW
Guaranteed to rock and shock and clock and
Oh, I made you say ow yes
You hear me rockin, you hear me clockin
You hear people jockin
Is it because I'm like smart like Mr. Spock and
Captain Kirk and, you know I'm workin
I'm bound to wreck your body, go OWWW, I go bezerk and
You always hearin, you always clearin, you always cheerin
Hey, umm, umm I'm dissapearin like Magic
I'm tragic, all of a sudden
You Gotta Have It like Spike Lee, hey, you know me
As the Uh-riginal B, I-Z, the M, the A
The ickaZarR-Kay, I-E
I'm not diggedy Das EFX but I can mic check it
The original, here to rock and get respected
I'm Markie, heh, the M-ahh-Zay-R-Kay
The man appointed rap King, and I'm here to stay
I'm down to wreck your body, I'm not here to scrub
I gotta pass it over, to my man Chubb

Verse Three: Chubb Rock

From the glass clear era that's the point of the one
Be unique, critique, from the crumb, me neva done
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
Then the Punky Brewster kids they, squeeze like rectum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
My hat I tip it, cheerio, kid and here I go
Off beat slackin, but the platinum mediocre rappers
With the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors
The, acoustic suits it, the boys juiced it then boost it
It kinda Gravedigs, well it should, Prince Paul produced it
What about bourgeoise, super star, in unleaded fuel cars
Hangin in bars, talkin the trife squads
Girls buckwild, child, in the rub-a-dub style
Every girl love oh Chubb Rock profile, smile
At the camera point your gluttimus to the man
At the movie star to smack out, with my rubber band
I can tell that, you need me, you don't want me to get paunchy
And me, I don't want to catch no HIV
So we'll protect you, and me but mainly me
If you don't want no rubber then P-E-A-C-E[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
Flatbush born, mingled with the Children of the Corn
Performed, got in the game eight years before Lost in the Storm
Remember St James, Gates and Green, odd hurdle
Got a few chips relocated to Waverly and Myrtle
Model chicks on Willoughby, Fulton is straight Estee Lauder
Spike Lee's up the street, Guru and Primo's up the corner
Easy Mo Bee was being more easy on Clinton
Got my LG niggas with luggage, straight tripping
I think Masta Ace was over there on Lafayette
Daddy-O was in Bed Stuy created the sonic of Stet
In Marcy there was The Jaz while Kane was on Lewis Ave
I'm from Vanderveer where niggas here don't take out the trash
We don't rap for nothing, we're all about hush cash
As a youth with a furrowed brow taking your bus pass
Peace to Star and Buc in Crown Heights with a smoke shop
Or my nigga Freeze in Bushwick with all that Spanish chocha

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Well after coming from a battle KRS won
Not for cash money, all for a charity that the Rev run
Seen DMC coming from EP's MD
Just bought tea, the product G&B from GMC
Hopped on the train, seen Lil' Wayne kick it
For a few minutes he came from the Hieroglyphics exhibit
Down there it's helter skelter, someone bucked shots
It was held at the Galleria by me and the X of Sadat
Dr. Dre arrived too late, someone left with a scratch
One person was maced, another with a scarred face
Corrupt cops began to snoop, questioned slum villagers
The only clue they had was a Timberland, and Daz's Dillinger
Def Squad heard nothing, Royce didn't talk
Described the gunman, 5'9" on the police report
They lied, he had an alibi, drove to Cypress Hill
Where Jalil sold cannabis and ecstacy pills
When the cops rolled up, doors locked, heads fled
Someone said Larry you shot up the spot with the Dead Prez
Pointed to Suave House, ??appoint?? ?????
Saw the cops, Larry's Adidas Shells sped like D12's
Jakes chased, lost him and they tried to get details
They saw Pete Rock, he quickly answered he didn't see L
In Larry's crib, found a safe, no key to the locks
Opened it, there was a bomb, three seconds left on the clock

[Hook]
So there you go, sound like someone you know
Got you thinking he gon' hook you up and help you blow
But then you don't, so now you're broke
Spent time in the studio, lost all your dough
You feeling low, taking your daily throw
Don't recoup that advance then it's them you owe
Without a hot song and you can't get a show
In this business it's not the talent, it's who you know

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
The Supervillain's the name, still in the game, the same biz
What's his face told y'all what the name of the game is
Downtown on the skip-stop, crisp new Timbs
Damage on my corns like flip flops, and who's him?
Rap cats act brave as hell
Get on the mic and turn gangster on some "Yeah, see" like Dave Chappelle
More like Screech, Saved by the Bell
Black man on some "I'm a man's man" man's man name is Shaq Man
Then they get on the first year later
Get their first hater, their first pair of gators
To the perpetrators he's The Unknown Comic
Who spit on the microphone in chunks of thrown vomit
It's just a shame, bust this aim
Lust for fame crushed his frame, like what's his name
And whatchamacallit remind him of Mini-Me
With Minnie Mouse in Gucci from her coochie to her skinny knee
Like thirteen earthlings, Cool Hand Luke
Who dropped jewel and influence the youth like Buk
All he do is puke and he in need of a speedy line
He said "every rhyme I mastermind like Se' Divine"
You greedy swine, don't eat pork
In the Streets of New York you out of place like Mork
From Ork, dork, Paul pop the cork
Drop me in Newark airport, I'm supposed to meet Björk
But what's all the fuss about? Hush up your big mouth
I sent her out to see Grimm to bust him out the big house
Yup, see that's how rumors get started
A certified older cat who don't get carded
DOOM could write a rhyme on demand
And get money as if he had time on his hands
And when he not in the lab doing flows and vocals
He out in the streets throwing bones with the locals
Never underestimate the next man's thirst
It could be way far worse than a whole jar of Starburst
Mmmm, he keeps those by the pound load
Emcees run from common locations like download
I think it's rather spectacular
How they come out they neck, bite and suck like Dracula
In case you just tuned in, once again
We're here with the Supervillain, known as hip hop's Gunga Din[KRS-One]
Can we hear the track please..
BLAOW! Who are we? (We..) {Reputation!}
Who are we? (We..) {Reputation!}
Only the best touch the microphone
(One two, check one two) You know whassup
Chubb Rock, KRS-One, get 'cha mind blown
Now we gon' talk about.. {Reputation!}
.. your reputation
(It's about to blow.. shit's about to blow big)
Reputation {Reputation!}
(Mental countdown) {Reputation!}
Lyrical skills we bring for the nation
(We have liftoff) Chubb Rock come down!

[Chubb Rock]
I am the big time figure, the bass drum hitter
The I am what I am rogueish nigga
A flow like lava, to heat up the chatta
Heat up ya mat'ta, then go stick her daughter
I oughta, Joe Cocker your opera
Crowd rock ya, I make you scream "Oooh ah ah!"
I, indubital mental big head
Praying for a battle if ya battle, you're dead
Get diesel, I do ya like they did Bugsy Siegal
I'm on the mic and Kris is really on the me-tal
Cuttin, backspinnin and recuttin
Your english bugged so you can't do me nuttin
Laced up lyrics and the beat real tight
Your song is wrong and I get focused right
With the EQ, be who, be you
When you're trying to be me, you and your crew
Just stop, before the shit gets too hot
You need respect - just to get a rep

[KRS-One]
Tra la la la la la la la lay
We the freshest deejay in America today, hey hey!
Tra la la la la la la la lay
We the freshest deejay, in America today - hey hey!

[Chubb Rock]
Well the lyrics of my peers have changed course here's
Platinum LP's, the subject is to swear, yeah!
And who wears what and what, fashion is up
And which designer cut is more corrupt
It's an open and shut case, no ill look is on my face
While the bass growls, profound nouns buy a vowel
I'm concerned because, "You Must Learn"
Before you croak, I've been dope since I was sperm
Sellin records, but of course with no return
On the mic you know I burn baby {*inhales*}
With your beats you know you have no respect
Kids haven't walked wild since "Go Stet"
And I bet when they stage rock they get booed
They need qualuudes to get crude and extra rude
The spirits have haunted your lyrics so I slept
Got nuff Z's, tryin to get a rep

[KRS-One]
If you thinkin that it's KRS you wanna take out
You better reroute quick you got it, all wrong
See when I grab the microphone career is finished
You better reroute quick you got it, all wrong
I do not mean to diss you but we simply are the best ones
And you can call him Chubb or you can call me KRS-One
Either way you'll get done, anywhere, any one
Me and lyrics one ton, straighten up and choose one SON
In nineteen-ninety-sess, KRS is in his peak'n
You will weaken and collapse like Michael at the Beacon
You talk more ish than a senator
You can't last, just call me enema, cause I'll be in that
Ass-teroid, heaven to merkatroid
I'm that 6L microphone holdin humanoid
Psychological like Sigmund Freud
But I get annoyed, cause these rappers have no brain
These hardcore rappers crack me up like cocaine
They got no skill or game
They sound like that commercial that be sayin
"Ask for Minoxonil, with Rogaine"
True skills I will explain
The T'Cha breaks the campaign down plain

{People always talk about..}
Complete blowout, complete blowout {Reputation!}
Check, complete blowout {Reputation!}
{People always talk about..}
"Now I understand what they're talkin about" {Reputation!}
"Now I understand what they're talkin about" {Reputation!}
"Now I understand what they're talkin about"[Intro]
"We did it like that and now we do it like this"
"We did it like that and now we do it like this"

[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
Now clock, kids, who got the cocaine?
Don't tell me it's the little kids on Soul Train
The metaphor sent from my brain to my jaw
It comes from other places, not the tinted faces
Journalistic values are yellow and then of course falters
You watch Channel Zero with that bitch Barbara Walters
She'll have you believe black invented crack
When President Lyndon had the formula way back
In '63 with Kennedy, yes the double cross
Remember that's when they blow his fucking head off
Vietnam vets come back looking like one-armed pets
Nixon bounced pure checks
No picket fence, no job, no 8-Cylinder car
Blue collar turns to bourgeois
Depressed in your chest, Demerol, for sess
No dough, crack in vials much less
Whitey can sell on the corners of Bushwick
Whitey can sell on the corners of Flatbush
White Tees can sell on the corners of Bed-Stuy
Pass the torch to that nigga guy
So just die, nigga, die, nigga
You're too black, you can't handle, you're too strong
Get high, fly clock next boost ya steal
In '95 we take back Ebbets Field

[Verse 2: O.C]
Brooklyn, traveling distance to party
Brooklyn, absent at functions, not hardly
Brooklyn, the name alone holds Godly
You don't know, you better ask somebody
Crack filled streets since '85
The beast getting paid to not bust, hookers drawers got crust
Claps clapping regular, hardcore niggas with
Fat gold chains, on the corner maintaining
Gold teeth flashing, stick-up kids playing in front of
Latin Quarters, keep home your daughters
Cause if bullets fly, watch the flaming
Ignorant ducks are shooting wilding, they're not aiming
One Easter, now I think about it, what a pity
Five people died in front of Skate City
Senseless, back then you was ill if you had a gun
People dashing flashing, damn no fun
Albee Square you couldn't shop too much cause
Fort Greene would hem ya wreck the fuck on up
You had Do or Die, East New York, mad hell
Fellas cutting school trooping to all go Maxwell
So many memories I can't manifest
Yo 'Ru, start where I finish and to Brooklyn, God bless

[Scratched Hook]
"Crazy ass Crooklyn kids"
"Represent the Brooklyn all-nighter"
"Crazy ass Crooklyn kids"
"Because it is, survival of the fittest"
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
Listen cause for your mind I got the right nutrition
We keeps shit hard like fat asses and cases of Heineken
Here in Brooklyn, home of the warrior and villain
Trife type chicks, Top Billin's the anthem
Rastas smoke marijuana
Enterprising businessmen shoot dice on the corner
Excuse me while I light my spliff but some choose to sip
So bullets hit brains, when bottles hit lips
Clips whatever happened to 38 special
Now it's Desert Eagles, government issue
Probably the same one that killed Noriega
Chips that powered nuclear bombs power my Sega
Subliminal hypnotism and colonialism
Leave most niggas dead or in prison
In Crook-land, right hand cuts off the left hand
To spite the hand, jealous of the next man
So violent crimes, black on black plus mad crack to boot
Everybody can't rap, so most hustle and shoot
Make money money, get money, take money
I can't understand that concept cause Jah rules everything around me
Fire burns the unjust like arson larceny
Melt MC's with mental telepathy
With precision, we're slicing and dicing
Peace to the East New York, Perverted Monks, and Mike Tyson

[Scratched Hook x2]

Crooklyn (2X)
