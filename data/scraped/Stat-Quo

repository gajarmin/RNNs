[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools, who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and, now I'm back
Sitting on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never would have thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose to more shows
Haunted you nights I suppose, that's how it go
With time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and

[Hook: Eminem]
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
I, never thought I'd find, someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fucking clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'til you went as far as going and snooping through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And whoulda even knew that, who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and
Reach up onto the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
Ha ha, yeah right bitch
Spend some time with my dick
In most cases - Stat's attitude is "fuck a bitch"
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was diff-er-ent, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic, we suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Trying to play slick, thinking I'mma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feeding you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close, but who coulda predicted to know
Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself, do I love these hoes? NOPE!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Em introduced us, 50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50
Then slid off and left her to kick it wit' me
I complimented her I said, "you have very nice lips"
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin' talking like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yea yea know how many times I done heard that shit?

[Hook][Intro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and A-B-C it, then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids just don’t give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playin' them hits "Oh, this my jam, this my shit"
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
Cause we don’t know anymore, what are hits?
Is it the beat, is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13-year-olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our sa-lyl-la-bles

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc is in the beat
Then I’m gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
Cause everywhere I go they love the "bling bling" flow
Bang bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost your man a lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow, you bought the shit
I guess you to blame too, I just found an angle
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her we in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids
Who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house in Malibu?
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong sa-lyl-la-ble

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30
Interesting, cause ever since then it's been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scrambling over what to do
Gambling every time we put a record out
Just looking for that hook (Wait Dre, look!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you and you love me too
We were meant to be cause
Shorty, you love me and I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I'm sick right into show, riding on lolo’s
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo’s
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s, that's slang for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked Loc
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playing, beat behind me playin'
So you don't hear anyway, you don’t hear what I’m sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere you turned
Shady/Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well, fuck the fuck offs, all y'all eat salt
Be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
New sa-lyl-la-bles eat ball, you fucks offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I’m running past while yall walk

[Verse 6: Cashis]
Shady made me for bringing it back
'fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spitting
About living in the mothafuckin' city you're at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, that's freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you can never be
It's a hidden, rhyme in the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my wind pipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I’m crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I’m Rosemary’s baby, I want you to hate me

[Hook]

[Outro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot hot hot beat and a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme schmo, mo, joe, toe and glow
Now get out there and sell some goddamn records![Intro: Obie Trice]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady, Shady
OOOOOOOOOOOOO-MIIIIIIIIIX ("Cryyyy")
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a ho's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
From the same turf as you's, nigga, what nerve of you's nigga
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit, nigga
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's but a nigga is on board

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga
Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissing you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Than clapping down bangers meant, for entertainment, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
You copy?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady!
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Alchemist
[Eminem] It's The Re-Up[Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think, you're the top and king of the castle
You're about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radi-O
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe
The same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big ba big big bay ba baby

[Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(STAT QUO!)We're back!

[Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I recieve
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick"
I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin, where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady!

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(BOBBY CREEK!)We're back!

[Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin through the track
Nigga

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(CA$HIS!)

[Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

Eminem - SHAAADDYYY!!!(Ha! I Told You We Was Back!)[Produced by Cash Jones, Stat Quo]

[Hook: Jake&Papa]
Killers hanging outside the windows, aye
Oh my, oh my, I got trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
I know my enemies run when that pistol shake
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I got trouble on my mind, trouble

[Verse 1: DUBB]
It's a stolen G ride whenever we ride
It's war where we reside so I gots to keep my
Pistol close, even cops killing folks
Give their ass the whole magazine, fuck a centerfold
Sixteen with it, ho, one in the chamber
Mask on my face so I remain a stranger
Death round the corner run inside when we pull up
Learn the negotiations, how you talking to a bullet?
Blap, blap, blap - what you hear when them shots go off
Devil on my shoulders told me squeeze my Glocks on y'all
Only the angel that I seen was the logo on the fitted
I'm a seven black nigga, all my enemies'll get it
Bloody rag wrapped around my motherfucking tech
Snoop "Murder Was The Case" what was playing in the deck
How else could I live my life
When yesterday's promise turn to present day's lies?
With the

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DUBB]
Yeah, fuck shooting brothers for the color of their rag
I'm shooting at the niggas with the badge
Catch you walking out the station, that's your ass
Nigga, that's for Mike Brown, pussy, that's for Eric Garner
Pig, that's for Sean Bell, die from these nine shells
Go against the SWAT team, meet us at the swap meet
Bloods and Crips together, peace treaty like it's '93
They the real enemies, they the ones that killing me
Killing you, they killing us, judges don't do shit for us
Cops kill a nigga, bet they'll never get a sentence huh
Get promoted right after getting off suspension
What the fuck is this world coming to?
Unarmed black kids, they putting guns at you
That's been happening for years so that's nothing new
Got me sick to my stomach, fuck a stomach flu
Tell captain or the police that we coming through
With troops that ain't scared to die and they love to shoot
Some out the roof, it sunk

[Hook][Intro: Eminem]
OHH! Stat Quo! Here we go!
C'mon, c'mon! You ready? (heh)
Let's do it man (uh uh uh uh-uhh)
Shady Aftermath

Sound, without focus, is just noise

[Stat Quo] + (Eminem)
Yeah (where you get that thang man) {By my side}
When you do somethin to somebody umm {By my side}
It ain't just you it's somebody next to you {By my side}
Youknow'mtalkinbout and I got my shit right here with me {By my side}
(There isn't everywhere you go that it's) {By my side}
(Okay) So being that that's the case {By my side}
Let me tell you about {By my side}
That place, heh, take you by my side {By my side}

[Stat Quo]
The way I growed up, sho' nuff, chips on my shoulder
Knew about that cola when I was in a stroller
But came ahold of choppin them boulders gettin older
Wantin a Rover, ducked in them rows meetin quotas
Shorty bipolar, load her by cock I tried to told ya
When movin the wrong direction ain't no flesh and then it's over
You on that doja, G.I. Joe shit but you ain't a soldier
Chopper or fold ya, you not cobra commander, you bozo
I'm the composer, writer of murder, the odor
Leakin out of your body, temperature is gettin colder
But you sweatin and dizzy like a person who ain't sober
Realizin your life is comin quickly to a closure
Losin composure, out of breath like you underwater
Twenty seconds in the game, and it's the fourth quarter
Primetime, "Dateline" are the best exposure
Now you're still, on the news and everybody knows ya
Yeahhhh, YEA!

[Hook]
By, my, side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they won't forget me it's - by my side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they don't forget me it's - by my side
Ye-yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh; by my side (ooh)

[Stat Quo]
Go now boy, get your vest, protect yo' neck, kill for fun
Watch how they run and scatter when I go and pull out my gun (gun)
Call me ignorant and young, psycho sicko negro
They know that I just fuck and be gone (gone)
Drivin crazy halfway dumb
Don't stop even when the law come, believe every word out my lungs
I'm losin it, snappin huh, this ain't just no rappin uh
Back all the way back when you see that strap cause it go ra-tata-ta
Are you ready to die tell me why you choose to tell me in my
Face, have your body dry, pack that fire, look in my eye
Have your spirit below me or floatin in the fuckin sky
All black is my attire, lookin like a umpire
Toss you in the trash like a bullshit album flop
Yeah yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh, YEA!

[Hook]

[Stat Quo]
The murder capital mo' mayhem, yes it's thriller
Put four in your head, have you floatin off in a river
It's cold, you shook, we crooks, your body'll quiver
These rappers so tough but really they softer than pillows
Or chinchilla or Twinkie filler, hone of a realer
They turn to serial assassins for some scrilla
Now me could see I mean him, yes this nigga
Stays true to what I do cause I keeps it realer
Be for real, have you ever ever pulled a trigger?
It's serious business shorty, nothin is more iller
No discrimination, you could be chocolate or vanilla
And find yourself in the presence of a fuckin killer
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeahhhh, YEA!

[Hook]

By my side, by my side {*blam*}

[Eminem]
It's "The Re-Up" {*echoes*}[Akon] Shady, Konvict, Upfront

[Hook: Akon]
I feel you creeping I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Shorty if you wanna ride you can ride on me
We can bump heads and collide on me
Want beef, damn right can rely on me
To bring that Campbell like Naomi
Just pull that girl and take it on easy
Looking all oiled up and all greasy
Bout that time you stop that teasing
Way that you drop done got me here cheesing
What's funny is that you taking
All my money for real
I'd rather spend it on you
Right now than my homie's bail
And I can see that's what you're made for
And ain't ever been no lame ho
With that booty bought and paid for
Won't move till you on my payroll!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah, Stat Quo! Ahhh!
I love when you do it girl move to it like you're used to it
Drop it down I want to put my thang through it
To the crib we go, go fast and slow
Make it twirl like a stripper slide down my pole
Shorty ass so swole got your boy like whoa
One night with me now she wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no, let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through and tap that hole
Make you lose control and all her girls know
That I hit it right at night, I'm a pro
I only come 'round and get sexual
If she flexible and bisexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if, only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that, murk that, work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine
Stat Quo, YEAH!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yeah, it's Bobby Creek, know'msayin?
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave I can see right through her
So we, dipped out, burn one trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body 8 like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care, listen baby it's a fact that
If you drop back I'mma quarterback sack that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at?

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Intro]
Hello? What up? Hello? Yo I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back...

[Verse: Eminem]
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do you can say good night and bye-bye to them my tunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
(Ay yo yo hold up! Hold up! Bring that back to the top man!)
(Marshall Mathers!)[Hook: Stat Quo]
I'm the next one next one
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me with me
Got a problem shorty come get me
Nah, I ain't Dr. Dre, nah, I ain't Eminem or 50, dog I’m Stat

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
As I think back, retract, from the classroom to the trap
Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps
It's hard to relax when your wage minimum, bein' broke
Fuck, with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem
I was trying to get on demo tapes state to state
Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes
Relying on faith hopin' my dreams take shape
And my fate meeting (?)
I would wait for these A&R’s say I ain’t grind bitch
Spendin' my last dime on this studio time shit
A lot of folk told me I was stupid for trying this
Situation crucial feds off in my climate
Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly
The spot got hot, scene felt like curry
Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta
Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together
Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever
You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather
Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better
I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort

[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I'm patiently waitin', used to get love
Now the same niggas hatin', wanna give me slugs
Partner don't get it separated or twisted, you can't fade it
Stat's the wrong motherfucker to play with, understand me

[Bridge: Eminem]
If you opened up your ears long enough to listen
You may hear what you've been missin' out all of this time
I've been put in a position to put all this in position
So quit your bitchin', learn how to rhyme
Get signed and get your shine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like this and like that and, uh, welcome to Statlanta
Shady Aftermath and, uh, a brand new rapper from Atlanta
Who goes by the name of Stat Quo
Introducing our new excuse to keep producin'
Continue to do music, use it and expand it and make rap grow
The hottest new shit on the planet, on a new plateau
But don't confuse it, you don't understand it
Let me break it down for you to show you how we do shit
So that you cats know, this is Statlanta 101
Cause we don't want no one walking out this motherfucker with tunnel vision
So anyone with questions you want answered
Just ask and we'll try to unmask them and maybe explain why so few cats blow
Just spit the truth when you get in this booth and do that though
That there boy hot to death, you already knew that though
Is he the greatest from the ATL, we got haters all day to debate us
So we'll just say this: he's one of them not to tackle

[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I got caviar wishes, box Chevy dreams
CD covers, TV screens
The booth or the block, might go to triple beam
I'mma make it right, hear me, huh huh huh
Fuck what your saying, God put me here to shine
Going on tour or white collar crime
The rhyme or the grind, MPC or the nine
I'mma make it, I need mine, huh huh huh

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
I can care less, fuck yall, you don't make or break me
Real niggas love me, pussy niggas hate me
Down bitches ride for Stat Quo, they know
The A-Town D Young County be trill folk
Didn't no other label offer me no deal
Till they found out Shady/Aftermath was interested
Then they started to beg, want the truth, there it is
This ain't a gimmick, this the south and I be that kid
Just ride through watching lines of his rhymes
In time you're going to find you're on a great trip
Ain't a word I could life be some extraordinary shit
The piece of the puzzle that fit, it's Stat Quo, you son of a bitch

[Refrain]* originally slated for "Eminem Presents The Re-Up"

[Intro: Stat Quo]
Hey, hey - most certainly {"LT Moe music, music, music.."} YEA!

Hey, hey - Statlanta, Statlanta..

[Stat Quo]
This is Zone 3 speakin, Stat Quo stay cheesin

Out here, I ain't leavin, you hatin for no reason
Keep bitchin and tongue teasin, them heaters'll start squeezin
Have you sick and grievin, dead not breathin
Get back, lay down motherfucker now, we even
Primetime G'in, him ya ain't seein
Mad cause I fucked yo' bitch, she suck my dick like she was eatin
The children's in my region, the city really needs him
Cause these niggas rappin, slackin and underachievin
Check my brain, know the name, the status I'm reachin
Ice you never dream of, while ya all are sleepin
Bad girl freakin, all night skeetin
Huh, pimp hard, leave the country for the weekend
No question, I'm him all season
Statlanta, oh yes, the one you should believe in

[Hook: Stat Quo]
Hey, they say I'm doin too much
I don't twist in my whip, blowin purp out the dutch (out the dutch)
No, shawty pop that clutch
Finger up, other hand on my nuts, shawty WHAT?
{"I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks"}
Hey {"I'm fresh, dressed, like a bil-I'm-I'm"}
{"I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks"}
Hey {"I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks"}

[Stat Quo]
Is he the street-est of the stret niggas? (Nope!) I ain't tryna be that
I'm just tryna get scrilla my nigga, shawty relax
Folk off in the barbershop, askin where I be at (where the nigga be at?)
Fuckin yo' bitch while you cuttin hair, nigga buy that
The {?} on my badge, GMM still intact
I don't snap when I dance, I just snap on this track (c'mon)
E'ry nigga tryin to trap on wax, ease back
Knock-kneed, I'm me, I won't slack but a scratch
I got love for my folk who really hustle for the snacks
I don't fire up a match, I know you wonder what I pack
Just know it's jet black, fully loaded, buddy act
I ain't tryin to be a gangsta but I will cock it back
To defend my folk, I'll be forced to react
On some violent shit, and push your wig straight back
It's Stat, dig that, I'm the shit, them the facts
You don't like me when you see me, keep it movin, bad back (AY!)

[Hook]

[Stat Quo]
I rep the A from my fitted on down to my feet
E'ry time I hit the club I'm goin home with a freak
Lames hate me from the side cause I'm who they wanna be
Bad bitches in my ride cause they all know that I'm
{"I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks"}
Hey {"I'm fresh, dressed, like a bil-I'm-I'm"}
Hey {"I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks"}

OHH! Stat Quo! Here we go!
C'mon, c'mon! You ready? (heh)
Let's do it man (uh uh uh uh-uhh)
Shady Aftermath

Sound, without focus, is just noise

[Stat Quo] + (Eminem)
Yeah (where you get that thang man) {By my side}
When you do somethin to somebody umm {By my side}
It ain't just you it's somebody next to you {By my side}
Youknow'mtalkinbout and I got my shit right here with me {By my side}
(There isn't everywhere you go that it's) {By my side}
(Okay) So being that that's the case {By my side}
Let me tell you about {By my side}
That place, heh, take you by my side {By my side}

[Stat Quo]
The way I growed up, sho' nuff, chips on my shoulder
Knew about that cola when I was in a stroller
But came ahold of choppin them boulders gettin older
Wantin a Rover, ducked in them rows meetin quotas
Shorty bipolar, load her by cock I tried to told ya
When movin the wrong direction ain't no flesh and then it's over
You on that doja, G.I. Joe shit but you ain't a soldier
Chopper or fold ya, you not cobra commander, you bozo
I'm the composer, writer of murder, the odor
Leakin out of your body, temperature is gettin colder
But you sweatin and dizzy like a person who ain't sober
Realizin your life is comin quickly to a closure
Losin composure, out of breath like you underwater
Twenty seconds in the game, and it's the fourth quarter
Primetime, "Dateline" are the best exposure
Now you're still, on the news and everybody knows ya
Yeahhhh, YEA!

[Hook]
By, my, side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they won't forget me it's - by my side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they don't forget me it's - by my side
Ye-yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh; by my side (ooh)

[Stat Quo]
Go now boy, get your vest, protect yo' neck, kill for fun
Watch how they run and scatter when I go and pull out my gun (gun)
Call me ignorant and young, psycho sicko negro
They know that I just fuck and be gone (gone)
Drivin crazy halfway dumb
Don't stop even when the law come, believe every word out my lungs
I'm losin it, snappin huh, this ain't just no rappin uh
Back all the way back when you see that strap cause it go ra-tata-ta
Are you ready to die tell me why you choose to tell me in my
Face, have your body dry, pack that fire, look in my eye
Have your spirit below me or floatin in the fuckin sky
All black is my attire, lookin like a umpire
Toss you in the trash like a bullshit album flop
Yeah yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh, YEA!

[Hook]

[Stat Quo]
The murder capital mo' mayhem, yes it's thriller
Put four in your head, have you floatin off in a river
It's cold, you shook, we crooks, your body'll quiver
These rappers so tough but really they softer than pillows
Or chinchilla or Twinkie filler, hone of a realer
They turn to serial assassins for some scrilla
Now me could see I mean him, yes this nigga
Stays true to what I do cause I keeps it realer
Be for real, have you ever ever pulled a trigger?
It's serious business shorty, nothin is more iller
No discrimination, you could be chocolate or vanilla
And find yourself in the presence of a fuckin killer
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeahhhh, YEA!

[Hook]

By my side, by my side {*blam*}

[Eminem]
It's "The Re-Up" {*echoes*}[Talking]
Mafia niggas

[Kanye - talking over Hook]
It's ya boy Kanye to The
The Roc is in the building right now
We smoked out
And I don't even talk like that
To the wall

[Verse One: Kanye West]
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bent-lino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with Jay-Z yo
For the tracks I done got 800 C-notes
So glad I ain't take the drive to Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repo'd
Fuckin with my girl today around three-oh
My man said let's call some girls that we know
Ohhhhhhhh!
Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I don't want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldn't make me now feel so sick, just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked, drink, and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it can't be enough

[Hook]

[Stat Quo - talking over Hook]
Wooo! Yeah! Haha.. Stat Quo nigga
Shady motherfuckin Aftermath, you understand me?
Uhh

[Verse Two: Stat Quo]
Looka here homes gettin my stunt on
I step in the bar I'm a superstar
They know who I are from the pimp description
Mack hoes just to get 'em in the doggy position
Put my key in yo ignition and work the kitten
Introduce you to how hustlers livin
Dick and bubblegum is all I'm givin
New whip, new year, new crib to sit in
I'll take ya bitch, make ya bitch make me rich
From major chips, but now you sick
How Stat Quo got dough to flow and 'dro to blow
Yak to sip and wigs to split
'Nuff grip won't slip, be easy
Your girlfriend wants to, please me
Make a porno, put her on TV
(Do a porno tape with that ho mayne)
Make that pussy drip drip when she see me

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire talking]
Yeah, yeah
You know what I told them cats?
Let me tell you what I told em

[Verse Three: Chamillionaire]
Go get a bigger scale
On a scale of one to six
I'm an 11, you're in heaven when I punish it
I got her naked but I know I wasn't gonna hit
She was lookin at it like that isn't gonna fit
I told her I was only gonna use half of it
If you want a smaller size go and rent a plastic dick
Why you actin like you a genital activist
Matter of fact you can get out, you can pack your shit
And she was like, "Ay, why you gotta act like this?"
Cus your wastin my time you can ask my wrist
Now you trying to talk to me about abstinance
She was like wait a second let me ask you this
Is you're name Chamillionaire, do you rap?
No
Ain't you on that song with Kanye West and Stat Quo?
Ron C says you was
Oh is that so?
And then I said if he did don't know what he told you that fo

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire talking]
Hold up
Make sure y'all look for my patna Stat Quo's upcoming solo album
Entitled "Statlanta"
On Crome-man Music with Shady Aftermath
Oh yeah man[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah! Come on! Come on!
ATL! Yeah! Haha! WOO!
If you feel like you've been touched
By our music that is

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Nowadays everybody just wanna poke their nose in our business
What is this some kinda joke?
Man, everywhere I go all I’m hearing is more talk
"What’s up with Jada and Fat Joe?
Doing a song with ol’ boy on a song “New York”
Man, I thought you just did a song with them both?”
Man, the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss Michael
You should get your ghetto pass revoked
I never had no ghetto pass, you asshole
You really wanna know, when I did live in the ghetto
I kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
So I suggest you get your facts straight before you go
This assuming to know
I ain't grow up in no trailer park just cause I was poor
Man, this is my testimo...ny to those that don’t know
Me, and feel like they do
If not to feel compelled to go and speak on me too
So this dick goes to YOU and this dick goes to YOU
And if you feel like you want it then you can get it too
And when your through pass it to the person next to you
Ayo, Stat get on the mic and come and spit a few

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Motherfucker's so quick, to spit bullshit
Stat Quo, who’s this, Em gave me the assist
Shorty got a full clip, standing in the pulpit
A–Town misfit, repping that south shit
Back four or some years ago, foe was hating, I hear them
My flow is skating across the track, rollerblading
Losing patience, want to get on chasing but this taking all my energy
Tired of waiting, people faking fronting like they kin to me
When they're really enemies, give a fuck what it is
Cuz, this what it gonna be, Shady/Aftermath lately
GMM, baby, young nigga out them projects Thomasville
Grady hospital, Freida’s only baby
Niggas biting my style get rabies
Fuck you, pay me, eat a cock, swallow shit
And plus you ain't fucking with this, so don’t trip, ha ha
???, what an incredible twist
I write incredible script
That fit in with the plot it’s endless
Now testify to this
Let it bang when you hear, this is classic shit[Produced by SAP]

[Verse 1: Game]
I wake up in the morning chilling with my feet up
Looking on my Instagram for pussy to beat up
Hey, Sap turn that beat up, Hey nigga roll that weed up
Riding through the hood top down trowing that B up
Turn that YG up
Cause niggas fed up
Niggas get murdered in my city not keeping their head up
I'm talking Bloods, Crips and shit
Bodies twisting like Liquorice
Watch when that pistol lit [Chik-Chik], Niggas hit the fence
Cowards, ducking in them led showers
Couple of niggas be snitching, pointing like watts towers [Shshsh]
That's how niggas get locked up
40 Glocc tough? what?
That nigga got socked up
And he suing me for four point five
Let me see, move the Decimal
Once to the right, that's a forty five
Glock hit the light, now you a vegetable

[Bridge 1: Game]
Tell 'em niggas where I'm from ... you heard
Stat tell em niggas where I'm from
AR tell em niggas where I'm from ... Esco
Dre, tell em niggas where I'm from

The City of money, power and tears
Overdoses, nightmares, Yeah
Can't walk Around here keep talking around here guns spark around here

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Atlanta nigga, my nigga raised round J’s, ran plays
Throwing up trey’s, my doggs squeeze triggers
Dreaming on what we be when we bigger
Firm Biz delivered
Haters shiver, they see us
Sedans filled with divas
Sniffing Justin Bieber
We staying in the game
You Lames's in the bleachers
Luxury vehicles with all the latest features
The Preachers can't reach us
Smoking Kush on the beaches, no reception
It's a blessing ever since recession just progressing
Bank account stretching, models in my section
Has I stare at my reflection?, Boss Nigga
This bitches love my complexion, they ain't just talk nigga
Huh
Crack in the pot let it bubble on the block
Watch it double so we can huddle and ball with the roc
Got niggas from, Watson, S.W.A.T.’s (Southwest ATL) and niggas from Harlem
But my niggas from Compton it's a problem
Firm Biz

[Bridge 1: Game]

[Outro: Stat Quo]
I swear these niggas lame my nigga

Your pour that shit out, niggas'll slap you off real
Straight molly-whopping. you're not welcomed
IPhone 5c ass nigga
You tought you was just gonna cut the corner and pay 99$ to shine
We don't fuck with you nigga
Half price ass bitch ass soft ass lame ass nigga
You understand me?
Yeah[Intro: Obie Trice]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady, Shady
OOOOOOOOOOOOO-MIIIIIIIIIX ("Cryyyy")
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a ho's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
From the same turf as you's, nigga, what nerve of you's nigga
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit, nigga
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's but a nigga is on board

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga
Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissing you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Than clapping down bangers meant, for entertainment, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
You copy?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady!
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Alchemist
[Eminem] It's The Re-Up[Intro: Bernz]
Uh huh
What we have here is a failure to communicate
Come on!

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
(Singing)
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Them: flashing lights and fast cars
Us: gas masks, flash mobs
Riots in Times Square
See, when the educated is unemployed it's unfair
With no visa, I'll devise an escape
Young Caesar, rise of the apes
On top of a police car, pose like the Heisman
Throwing fire bombs at an Exxon advertisement
We are on that check-to-check shit
They are socially disconnected
From the youth who get thoroughly disrespected
See, monkeys receive minimal information
So this, that subliminal renegade shit
For the criminal minded who are tired of slave shit
That Martin Luther King slang sling free speech
Shit you need to learn: no texts, retweet

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
The agony of defeat
Walking across the beat
Writing my pen on a leaf
Smoking a leaf, seeking retreat
In the nose-bleed seats
The game seem out of reach
But if I dive towards my suicide
The whole game goin' cease
What the fuck wrong wit' him?
Is he on that Whitney or Mike wit' 'em?
Fame will drive you crazy
No license just nights when
You're partying lines on the table
Pills in every color
You're feeling unstable
Screaming out for your mother
Drowning in that puddle
Still waters run deep
Aretha, in the background
Singing fairy-tales, you can't sleep
No logo peak can sow what you reap
From crawling in the deep
And the reaper creep
And barely eat, it eats
At you, it makes you weak
Amongst the meat
Color that's drowning in bleach
Did you find what you see
Covered in a sheet?
Oh my god, it's Sesame Street
Open the gates and let me free
My brain is sayin' to let you be
Can't you see the total fee
To take a life ain't worth the key
To break them lies so it's best that we

[Hook: ¡MAYDAY!]
Death march
Walking towards our demise
I see the cliff, they see my eyes
This ain't a time for goodbyes on a
Death march
Walking towards our demise
I see the cliff, they see my eyes
Nose dive!

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Tie an army to your boot straps
Coffee in your blood
Wallet full of food stamps
Pocket full of drugs
Blue prints to move this city from the mud
You get a discount at the morgue, if you're digging yourself up
Yeah, you go ham, I go back bacon
Taking steps towards death and the method is quite back breaking
Show up for dinner like a lab patient
Better yet, a masked Jason
You're pointing at me like "Is that Satan?"
Not in the slightest, lieutenant
Treat my organ like my rifle
I'm a spiteful Lou Bennett
I'm a menace to all ministers
Evident star winners
As vivid as all Genesis
Give me a call, religion engaged
I sip a soda can full of rage
And welcome Death's doorbell ringing on me any day
Modern warfare best believe that many play
I'd rather die amongst the tribe than be alive as any slave

[Verse 4: Bernz]
Counting sheep, not for sleep
Counting them cause so many surrounding me
They walk the streets, they're watching me
Lately I look over my shoulder constantly
Walk in a haze, foggy daze for days
So foggy I can hardly see the nuclear waste
So resorting to drastic measures
Propelling from roofs, cement boots and tarred feathers
La-la-la-lately feel sedated to
Slipping me poison, when I drink your wine and eat your food
Is it enough for you to change my mood?
How does it taste? I think I'd like a se-se-second scoop
How come this whiskey make 'em shifty?
Black-magic addicts signing up early just to get tipsy
My family told me be careful, they know this life's to risky
I told them pay 'em no mind, while we marched in the line

[Hook: ¡MAYDAY!]City, Ridin' around, try to make it till 6 [laugh]

CHORUS
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]

VERSE 1
I dont mean to be rude but
Most all ya muthfuckas suck, what
You dont understand that a man is man when he develop a plan and he got guts
Nuts over size cahones do it right now you can count money sooner
Black track suit and some all white pumas
Lost in a cloud, no time for the rumour
Tryin to get some of that feta scratch
You against me nigguh mismatch
Couple more blunts a?
And cool like a guy with a eyepatch
I back, spinal, what I say go muthafucka thats final
'Case you never heard of me I'm [b-b-b-bobby creek]...

CHORUS
...I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]

VERSE 2
First off I roll up a lil somethin'

Shawty said her names Anna
Born in Atlanta
College educated plus fine grammer grammer
Ass shots titty's done
Bad mamma jamma
Couple screw's loose but I still wanna hammer
She use to that lobsta
So I grab a cup and no whoppas
Upsize the value meal to sprite on ice some vodka
Cuttin in the braun won't make to morn'
She had a blueberry bra, rasberry thong
Strawberry kush we smokin goin she bowing to the song she blowin' I'm blowing...

CHORUS
...[dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]

VERSE 3
Live and direct from one point olan?

Whatever, whenever
We in my penlight and freedom fight till it most likely I will die for whatever
[re-re-reason]
My my how things have changed
They killing lame over nouns and verbs
And material things that dont mean shit
We should all be ashamed in the grand scheme of it
Eat a dick in public, yup you gotta love it
I said my piece got it off my chest
Get off my back
Oh...by the way my name is [B-B-B-Bobby creek] and this is Stat..

{Stat Quo}
VERSE 4
...Quo on his yogi purp in my stogie
Bitch making wishes on my dates so they blow me
Downtown L.A. got me feeling like I'm Kobe
Beverly Hills in a swimming pool I'm cool as Axel Foley
I'mma mothufuckin' menace, these niggas ???? up in it
No playboy I dont hate scrimmage
Ball hard cause I'm in it for the penny
Lil mama tried to say she independant
Till the cheque fell through and her rent was due
Now she out there whorin'
Anotha day anotha daughter BITCH I'm blowing...

CHORUS
...[dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]

B-Bitch I'm blowin [dope out my, dope out my, dope out my window]
Yeyy![Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Game]
And the kush became so strong
And the flights became private
And the bread became so long
Fast money and fly whips
We high, don't stop the smoke
And we fly G5, we so far from coach
Now you see why, when we high, can't stop the smoke
And we fly G5, we so far from coach

[Verse 1: Game]
Smokin' that Buddah fillin'
Blowin' that Kudda illin'
I'm runnin' through the millions
I'm sittin' roofless chillin'
Cooler than a polar bear
They flockin' cause they know it's there
Money gang, money straight
Like Joakim Noah hair
That's no bullshit, game time
Make you niggas change minds
Forfeit, or consume a full clip
Nigga like me eatin' swordfish
With your bitch, watchin' Swordfish
Niggas can't ignore this
You can't afford this - extravagant shit
We Louie Gucci Birkin baggin' this shit
Bag of the piff
Hot-boxin' in the back of the six
With Jimi Hendrix on... immaculate shit
Long way from... Compton
Where we used to, bag it in shifts with mags and the clips
Hurricane, right back on the shit
Back on the block with a package of spliffs
From blowin' cactus, the Wiz, what it is?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, you niggas want kush? We got ounces
Cookies we got pounds, clips we got rounds
Hundred thousand dollars when I skip through your town
Baller shit, don't even want a piece, man, we want all of it
Thirty thousand on the piece where my collar sit
Went so hard in the middle, East don't know what to call this shit
Now I'm buyin' up all the champagne
Drinkin' away all of my problems, bitch
Might sound crazy
But I just left the private plane, promoter paid 100k
And I ain't even stay the whole day
Hit the crib, bought a pound and smoked the whole thing
That Givency Men's collection, copped the whole thing
Not to mention all these diamonds in my gold ring
Made it to the top with nobody knowin'
Niggas say they safe, but nobody's showin'
Man he beats this shit, but nobody flowin'
Old Versace shit, the newest Rick Owens
If I'm rollin' it, you know that it's potent
With The Game and we smokin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
Hah, it's self-explanatory how we get it
Roll the purp in a plane ticket
Stat hop to that money, but I don't ribbit
Post playa ball, nice in the pivot, Jays on but I fuck with Pippin
Kays on when them niggas trippin'
Uh, pools of your partner blood, ya boy stay slippin'
Never tippin', stay sippin'
Court side, Blake Griffin
Stay missin', stackin' fitted while you niggas stay bitchin'
Coka and Boca, the kush of them strokers
Grand daddy and oova, blow that smoke to Jehovah
Four-fifty my motor, use your bitch for my chauffeur
I done Kobe'd the Cobra, Mark Price'd the Rover
T-top in the Trans, hit the gas and it's over
Bitch please, this is how we get them hoes the doja
I got shooters, I know growers from Vancouver
Plus I'm cooler than the cooler at your grandmomma's picnic
Bitch you?
Somethin' chill from Brazil, on the L
With Wiz and Game, my life is like Corona commercials
Family matters, Kevin Love at you Urkles
That's them wolves, niggas
They here to reverse birth you
Murk you, lights out no curfew
Bitch ain't stoppin' 'till my unborn seed's seed is rich
Or 'till Jesus sit right next to me and smoke 'till the seasons switch, my nigga

[Hook][Hook: Lucia]
Back in the day when I started this
I never thought of all this, that I’d have all this
I came so far, got a little more to go
To live these dreams for my soul to grow
(X2)

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
This is the dream, came up but still I grind
So far to go, hurdles I climb in my mind
These lines that I write, describe my fight
My prime objective is to transform my life
When shit got dark I took steps towards the light
Personal plights, live as a gamble we roll the dice
It’s a game we win, take baths in sin
Chin covered in bruises, now who’s the losers
Work hard, play hard, that’s how we maneuver
In the jungles with the vultures, snakes, and barracudas
No wonder we tote choppers and rougers
Trying to ball hog, enemies want to out hoop ya
It fucks with you when your friends become shooters
Aiming at your back, wanna see you laying flat
I keep my eyes on the prize, words on the track
Ain’t nothing in this world gon’ stop young Stat
Believe that!

[Hook: Lucia]
Back in the day when I started this
I never thought of all this, that I’d have all this
I came so far, got a little more to go
To live these dreams for my soul to grow
(X2)

[Verse 2: Asoka]
I’ve been doing it on my own, I was up in Rolling Stone
Trying to build a happy home and provide for my own
Working on the road, all alone, feeling lonely
Praying to a God, wondering if he’s even knowing me
For years, everyday, I thought how to make it out
Some people made it tough, I never thought they would doubt
And haters suck hard, man they still hating now
All I ever wanted was to make you all proud
Now I got the plate and everyone wanna taste
And I contemplate should I let the hate erase
Or should I make ‘em pay, and make these haters race
Cause back in the day the same laughed at my face
Irony, now all these girls got their eye on me
Desire me, wanna take me to their bed and lie on me
Lie to me, whisper in my ear oh so quietly
But honestly, it’s ain’t me, it’s the fame that they dying to see

[Hook: Lucia]
Back in the day when I started this
I never thought of all this, that I’d have all this
I came so far, got a little more to go
To live these dreams for my soul to grow

It's poppin speakers knockin crowded off on the flo'
They jockin it, watchin when I walks through the do'
It's him, tell a friend but you already know
Act stupid or lose it, don't bother to fuck with Quo

Sippin Cognac in between two beautiful
Bitches in the club, talk shit it's your funeral
I came to get a buzz and crunk, understand?
It's crowded, it's packed, it's jumpin - goddamn it's swole
I'm cooler than cool as my temperature's - 30 below

We mackin, excuse me miss, tell me what's your name
The way you move in them jeans make me happy you came
I'm tryin to get to know you, possibly get some brain
I may pick your brains, I'm the man of your dreams
You like me you wanna be wifey and join my team
So I can sport you and support you by any means
Nah, I ain't givin you none of my thangs
But we can leave the club tonight, hit the telly and fuck
Long as you know when I bust - I'm in the dust
Ain't no chillin, it ain't nothin for us to discuss
Except what time your ride pickin you up (YEA!)

[Hook]

[Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah

Do somethin girl, touch the ground (YEA!)

Flow so, hot, they say I got it, locked
Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear
Look the wrists stay, rocked, the Ruger stay, cocked
I hope you smoke a lot cause I supply your weed, spots
Got a few questions and I need the answer on the spot
That bitch you with, she like you or she like what you got?
Tryin to maintain, tearin niggas out the frame
Semi-automatic flows; you know how it goes
Boss, B-O-S-S-M-A-N, gun in hand
Understand, gettin money is the plan
Greg Street is my man

[Hook]

[Stat Quo]
Uhh, gettin money, YEAH!
Stat Quo baby, Atlanta's own in this thang
Uh, uh

I stays by my 'fetti baby, big boy Chevy baby
Choose a pimp, hop on in, only if you're ready baby
Ain't no ifs or maybes, motherfuckers gotta pay me
Radio, gotta play me, stack a mil', I know you hate me
Stat Quo partner got a stable full of head dollars
All my folk cold choppers, even though the Feds watch us
Tired of duckin the blockas, shawty fresh as {?}
Snitchers sing to the coppers like all them tryin to stop a G
Playa ain't no stoppin me, I'm the nigga that you tryin to be
Live from Atlanta or in Dallas with my homie Street
Ain't no way or ain't no eat, my mom used to make lunch free
My ma speak, now that's street, that the way we do
We gettin money (yea!)

[Hook]

[Lloyd Banks]
Look, it's on now time to cut the cake, fuck the Jake, tuck the plate
Make a move, dump the eight, guaranteed to pump his breaks
Too pissy drunk the case, ain't got a month to waste
Smile with a pumpkin face, deep enough to jump the states
Stuff him in the trunk escape - you want a problem
Fuck the bass, up the stakes, everything I wear is up-to-date
Loyal cat, guarantee my son'll be a spoiled brat
Hot enough to boil crack, M-5, all you black
I'm the reason all you rap, admit it I'm daddy black
Doin this since "Caddy Shack" with Greg Street in that Cadi-llac
Blowin on a pillow pack, I call it Koffee Brown
Bitches can't get off me now, rasta-man toss me pounds
I ain't from a softy town, niggas'll break your bones, crack your faith
Call the doctor, let him put it back in place

[50 Cent]
Ha ha ha, 50 Cent yeah
What you gon' do boy?
From New York to Atlanta to Dallas boy
I'm all over the place, I'm international playa
You heard me? Ha ha ha
Case you dealt with me{*Antonio McLendon harmonizing*}

[Intro: Stat Quo]
YEA! Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh uh uh uh
Sing the song now, uh, YEA!
Ha, all my niggas in the muh'fuckin struggle
Uh, uh, let me talk to you

[Stat Quo]
We from the ghetto, born in the bullshit
Preacher in the pulpit, granny need a lil' fix
Blood pressure high, work a job, no benefit
Whip repo'd, now it's back to the dealership
Tryin to play the game, gettin played like instruments
On the fence in my defense, make a mile out an inch
Momma said the devil in my soul, I should repent
My dawg lost his daughter, say he ain't seen God since
Said "Look bruh, listen bruh, ya ain't makin sense"
He replied "You right," pockets full of lint
Willie Lynch hung shit, hint hint
The root of all evil, now I know what they meant
To my dawgs in Flint hustlin to pay they rent
Thomasville Heights all night in a trench
Fuckin with the junkies or 9-to-5 on a bench
Clockin in, clockin out, like "Where time went?"
Damn, YEA!

[Hook: Antonio McLendon]
I come up hard, hard baby
But what don't kill you makes you stronger
But I come too far, far baby
To watch tears drop from yo' hunger
As long as we keep on grindin, keep on tryin
Wishing's not enough
To change our situation, time is wastin
We got to come up

[Stat Quo]
Uhh, ghetto USA...
I keep tryin to get ahead, but the fact still remain
Every dime I make it take half of my change
Ain't nuttin change, same fight, same ring
But it ain't pay-per-view, it's a survival thing
Some slang green pills, crank and 'caine
Some bitches strip and gold-dig and whore to maintain
My aunt just lost her job, here this shit go again
Couldn't pay her bills, she put a bullet in her brain
Her chil'en in the same house livin with the stains
On the wall, can't afford to move, what a shame
Shit done drove my uncle insane
He talkin to himself thinkin he the one to blame
Got seduced by the boy, shootin trouble in his veins
Wanted the pleasure, became a slave to the pain
Livin in the streets, died drowned by the rain
His life down in twos{?}, his blood flowin through the drains
Damn, YEA!

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Stat Quo]
Now or never
Now, and forever
Yeah, every nigga in the struggle!
OH! YEA!{"Sound without focus, is just.. noise"}

[Hook: DJ scratches]
"And-and-and let's start it like this son"
"If you don't like my lyrics you could press fast forward"
"It's all good!"
"If this was drugs I'd make a million"
"Focused man, my money on my mind"
"Wait, I had to let it marinate"
"What the FUCK!"
"If you don't like my lyrics you could press fast forward"
"Turn-turn my, turn my headphones up"
"I'm blowin up like you thought I would"

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Nickel, what up Focus...?
Yeah, uh-huh, yea yea yea

It's the ten rap commandments, number one just be an ill nigga
You will lose, you try to race this like Hilfiger
I'm so ghetto with the fo' metal
Show nuff blowin' up on challengers like the '84 shuttle
Fuck the count nigga, Preem like a triple beam
Sicker than sickle cell or picture listenin to sickle sing
Kick in the door wavin the fo', clad in navy velour
Wax niggas fast like shavin below
A gangsta nigga, I'm fly, I'm a sight
I was dope before Escobar told me what Nas is like
When I spit the gasoline see the fire fly
There'll be nothin after Preem, this is me and my homage
Like I rely on Raj, I lean on what's happenin'
Got the "Hey HEY hey!" like Dwayne, I'm stuck trappin
I've gone sick like the song "DWYCK"
Any nigga feelin big all you gon' get, is a long kiss
Preem

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Phonte]
Uh, right here is where the verses start
Dedicated to that classic New York sound and it really hurts my heart
To see the people can't, recognize the Works of Mart
And how they truly was a work of art
I understand we ain't back in the old days
But youngens be lookin at my nigga Preem funny like he one of the O'Jays
No sense of history; see Chris Martin in the credits
They be thankin it's the nigga from Coldplay
So I gotta school 'em and remind these toddlers
That hip-hop started in the days of yonder
Any fool with a S-line 50 can make beats
But this man took it and redefined a genre
Who else could make the Group Home sound like pros
Then make Christina Aguilera sound like soul?
This is my homage and I gotcho' head bobbin
And noddin, so we gon' bring the scratch collage in
Like this! Phontigga, uh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
Stat Quo nigga, HEY!
Primo, whaddup man?
Take y'all a trip down memory lane
Hehe, you did that too

Step in my arena, but make it known friend or foe
Recognize, I gave you power with this undeniable flow
I'm invincible, live by the code of the streets
My game plan simple, no surrender, no retreat
Salute the trill, cause none of y'all betta
Stay disciplined on the front line and together - Now
Stay tuned for the moment of truth
Suckas gotta come clean when Stat in the booth
It's mostly tha voice, that's why I got mass appeal
A black cowboy, too deep me and the steel
Say your prayers muh'fucker 'fore you outta here
Just to get a rep I'll end your career (okay)
Been a long time comin', blood, sweat, and tears
I'm royalty, classic like a beat from Premier
The public lovesick from real hip-hop and shit
Here today, gone tomorrow, I refuse to quit
It's Stat Quo... and Primo
YEAH!!

[Hook][Intro: King Marie]
So, close
But so, far away

[Hook: King Marie]
I just wanna be a dreamer
I just wanna be a king
I just wanna get lost
I just wanna be me, I just wanna be free
I just wanna be (X3)

[Verse 1: Game]
Put on my Dre Beats when I don't wanna hear the world talkin'
The walls closing in, the studio feel like a coffin
But I resurrect myself every time like I'm Jesus
Rather walk on water in the streets niggas dying for Yeezy's
Niggas sleeping outside for them J's
Know how it feel to be homeless even if its just for a day
Some of us bow our heads down when we pray
Some of us bow our heads down so you can miss us with a stray
I grew up with DeSean let that young nigga play
Turn to run a slant let the bullet fly Zimmerman's way
I did it Eminem's way, when I was sitting with Dre
It was Aftermath or die then, Busta told me ride in
Snoop told me if you a dragon go spit that fire then
Game of thrones, I made my home inside that lion's den
And all my enemies I don't know where to find them
But me I got like nine in

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
The son of Maya Angelou and Martin Luther
But my daddy was a crackhead, my mom was a booster
Born in the belly of Medusa with the killers and the three time losers
These cops pursue us, thug gangs recruit us
To carry on some torch, they were taught, would improve us
As the system maneuvers, they just feed us manure
They living in paradise, we shoot it out in the sewer
I call myself Stat to remind myself not to be a statistic
As the kush get twisted my consciousness get lifted
We party with devils, digging graves with dull shovels
Diamonds on my bezel my grind on some other level
I'm subtle but won't settle, all black clothes
They say Stat you too ghetto, my pen wrapped in turbans
My bombs, bass and treble, fell asleep in hell
I woke up living my dreams, I'm a rebel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: SAP]
I just wanna be a dreamer, I see all these things with my eyes closed
Woke up to reality, actually in fly clothes
Life is such a gamble, I'm proof that the odds roll
So anything we planning we do it colossal
Hurt people that I know was dreamers, which means that just makes my grind meaner
Let me turn my rhymes into a time machine and remind the people
How dope these lines can be when you're tryna reach the higher league
You seem to bleed through the soul to the choir speakers
I am preaching, to the younger nigga I used to be
And usually it's just inspiration that you can use to be
Bigger than the world in a world where you are user free
But still you live off of so much more than what you used to see
But who the fuck am I kidding, this shit is even new to me (word)
I got with Game, I got in the game, and I could chew a piece
Of this fresh cooked filet, I could eat it every day
But I swear this the beginning, I be dreaming every day

[Hook](Verse)
Fuck being humble, I used to work at MacDonald’s
Frying chicken at churches, serving my niggas combos
I had breakfast with Bono, private flights in Toronto
5 star suites in Milan, just the life of a don
Breaking Bad like Walter, yea now it’s stressin like Jesse
IRS on my ass, Uncle Sam tryin to get me
Oh Lawd, oh Lawd oh Lawd I need liberation
Smoking on chunky fine day and night, it feel like I’m bassin
You see you made that pressure eat you alive
For the sake of my son and mama I had to survive
Either rappin’ or trappin’
Had no time for relaxin’
This my mufuckin passion
I’m so sorry Miss Jackson
That I ain’t
Get a 9-5 after graduatin’ with my bachelors
I was born to make it happen
This in my genes, fuck slackin
Ain’t no thing but chicken wings, see I stay true
When you deep in the grind this how the real wasn’t through

Smoking on stankonia in southern California
Zontre til the death of me, this money is my destiny
So fresh, so clean
Fresh out of Beverly… Hills
Born in the bank, yea I remain a G
MIA with my Haitians and why she smoking Jamaica?
Florida with them Mexicans, my white boys clean up that paper
Yea I suffered some losses, congreagated with bosses
Strippers trickin and flossin
Have a bank account in the coffin
Friends left me stranded, family took me for granted
Got stabbed in my back like Caesar, I ain’t panicked
Hold on, get strong my nigga
I was born for the pro my nigga
Even when I’m gone my nigga
My mind on home my nigga
Get up, get out
Ain’t no bread on the couch
Bullshit ain’t allowed, I gotta rep for the south
Devil putting holes in my boat
You chose to sink or float
I survive just to shine, all you lame niggas hope

On a 1 to 5, hit one or tee, they remind of the low
I got gasoline dreams, red velvet ambitions
Love them jazzy bells, bitch dunk yo ass
This is bouncing and it’s switching
Roll and climb the nerve, flim flam, yelli hoody who
My elevator’s going up now cuz yo boy’s sucka proof
See these haters gon hate
Cuz that’s what haters do
I’m celebratin now, I made this thing a truth

I feel you creeping I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Shorty if you wanna ride you can ride on me
We can bump heads and collide on me
Want beef, damn right can rely on me
To bring that Campbell like Naomi
Just pull that girl and take it on easy
Looking all oiled up and all greasy
Bout that time you stop that teasing
Way that you drop done got me here cheesing
What's funny is that you taking
All my money for real
I'd rather spend it on you
Right now than my homie's bail
And I can see that's what you're made for
And ain't ever been no lame ho
With that booty bought and paid for
Won't move till you on my payroll!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah, Stat Quo! Ahhh!
I love when you do it girl move to it like you're used to it
Drop it down I want to put my thang through it
To the crib we go, go fast and slow
Make it twirl like a stripper slide down my pole
Shorty ass so swole got your boy like whoa
One night with me now she wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no, let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through and tap that hole
Make you lose control and all her girls know
That I hit it right at night, I'm a pro
I only come 'round and get sexual
If she flexible and bisexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if, only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that, murk that, work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine
Stat Quo, YEAH!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yeah, it's Bobby Creek, know'msayin?
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave I can see right through her
So we, dipped out, burn one trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body 8 like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care, listen baby it's a fact that
If you drop back I'mma quarterback sack that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at?

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Intro]
Hello? What up? Hello? Yo I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back...

[Verse: Eminem]
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do you can say good night and bye-bye to them my tunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
(Ay yo yo hold up! Hold up! Bring that back to the top man!)
(Marshall Mathers!)[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools, who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and, now I'm back
Sitting on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never would have thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose to more shows
Haunted you nights I suppose, that's how it go
With time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and

[Hook: Eminem]
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
I, never thought I'd find, someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fucking clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'til you went as far as going and snooping through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And whoulda even knew that, who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and
Reach up onto the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
Ha ha, yeah right bitch
Spend some time with my dick
In most cases - Stat's attitude is "fuck a bitch"
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was diff-er-ent, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic, we suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Trying to play slick, thinking I'mma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feeding you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close, but who coulda predicted to know
Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself, do I love these hoes? NOPE!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Em introduced us, 50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50
Then slid off and left her to kick it wit' me
I complimented her I said, "you have very nice lips"
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin' talking like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yea yea know how many times I done heard that shit?

[Hook][Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, nigga! Stat Quo! Welcome to Shady my nigga!
Congratulations, another nigga out the hood!
I'll vouch for ya, lets go, nigga!

[Hook: Stat Quo] + (Obie Trice)
This is for my bitches and my dogs
Gettin' that cheddar fuck the law
Stay on ya feet and never crawl
STAY BOUT IT!
(This is for my niggas and my hoes)
(keep ya head up fuck ya foes)
(get ya bread up to ya nose)
(Over Crowd It)

[Verse 1-Obie Trice]
My name is O and to the B-I-E
Trife life, entety
Envy me, injuries
Niggas who pretend to be
Gangs-tah, nigga you's a fake-ah
Gettin' money maj-ah, nigga you can hate if it's ya nate-ch-ah (nature)
Never stop gettin' paper though
All that 'cho, just waitin' on a ho
Gotta raise cocoa, put her in grade-A schools where asians go
Amazing, two years retro, and in a vacant home where the aafes sold
Now a nigga's on the road, sellin' out major shows, hate me hoes
Never would have fathomed that
Big lipped nigga from school Craft
Have access to the masses
Now they sweatin' them backstage passes
Try to give a nigga ass, cause I roll with a gangsa style
Where was you at when I was on the ave, tryin' to get cash up/ (BIATCH!)

[Hook]

[Mini Hook] [Olivia Singing]
I am so alive! [Obie Trice-Gotta get that money man, and ain't a thang funny man]
I am so high! [Obie Trice-You rollin' up that skunk, i'm off that crunk juice, punk]
And I spy I feel so alive [Obie Trice-Shit, I gotta get that money man, and ain't a thang funny man]
And I am so high [Obie Trice-Liven up, then hit that ATL on'em]

[Verse 2-Stat Quo]
S-T-A-T-Q-U-O
With the awkward flow from the AT, do
Wrist 'fo too cold, he swole, he roll, fo' sho' he gettin' plenty hoes
Ridin' fled, by my grip
GMM, that's my clique
Fresh fit, new kicks
I'm the shit, might see me wit
Yo bitch, on the strip
Super slick, hate on me eat a dick
Born to get plenty chips
Is he rich, damn right, every day
Every night, motherfuckers can't see me, bibi
I made this look so easy
Signed with E & D the recipe, how can you not love it
Tipsy off that hennesy, and other types of bubbly

[Mini Hook] [Olivia Singing]

[Verse 3-Obie Trice]
Obie keep a couple hoes, tokin' on that okie-do
Dick up in they ass so them hoes know they gotta smoke
They know O, ain't for jokes, thats fo' sho
So they try to hold on, as long as possible like a rodeo
I mean that that dick do so much damage
That Obie's not that average, so you gotta pardon me, i'm so savage
Gotta lot of bitches wantin' marrage
What bitch who? horse in a carrage
No bitch thats not obie's status
Gotta know my apparatus
Pimp, no food stamps, no pampers, no lips
Strictly prophalactics inside these oversized mag-anums
When i'm dickin' down these actresses then
Cut'em like John Singleton, in a matress askin' him when they seein' him again
