[Intro]
I got the new world in my view
On my journey I pursue
I said I'm running, running for the city
I got the new world in my view
I got the new world in my view
On my journey I pursue
Lord said I'm running, running for the city
I got the new world in my view

[Verse 1]
They ain't got no muscle, no hustle
No backbone, I stand alone
Not tripping, just saying, I'm different
Ain't hanging on the coattails of the next man
Passport in my left hand, thinking that you are next
Heck, hope you ain't holding your breath, man
Cause I'm out here, I'm hungry, I don't play around, trust me
Ain't hexed my drive since my Honda Civic got rusty
And my girl said she loved me, it's funny
Just thinking back, study hard for that 9 to 5
Like I thought that I'd be good with that
I was dreaming, still dreaming, spoil it on me like Willie Beaman
Still performing like Al Pachino, we stuck around in tuxedos
With my peoples, we growing up 'stead of seeing others slowing up
Tint squad, we throwing up, every time we showing up

[Hook]
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with you now
They don’t wanna give it up
We gon' make it out
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with them, yeah
They don't wanna give it up
We don't make them ask it

[Verse 2]
It don't get no greater, feel like I'm on fire
Feel like I'm Johnny Storm, feel like I'm volatile
Explosive, get close enough to notice
Your girl act out of character when she see me approaching
Ain't pouching I'm just saying it's nothing
You punching above your weight, I'm something
She ain't seen no substitute in that A team
That's B.A., Baracus, that BS, that whackness
Get no play in my axis, make 'em jump like AJ Hackett
Guarantee you in these boots they couldn't walk one mile
I really need to go and hang it up like a drunk dial
So behind the times they should probably rock a sundial
Shattering their dreams, I could make Big Pun smile
Music from the soul, don't need them to help me
If they fiending for the flash, they should take another selfie
Said I'm running, I'm running like Mo Farah so dapper
Swear the whole world could go against me, it don't matter, man

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm on the chase
Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place
We ain't got much to lose
I wanna taste
Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place
We ain't got much to lose

[Hook]I'm in zone, yea

Stay prepared for the up and downs, life is like a see-saw
Some say it's a bitch, man I couldn't agree more
One minute you're on top, then you're in the ER
One minute she wants you, then she wants to leave

All I can do is take the good with the bad and keep on
Gotta work hard, gotta give the fans the mean songs
Give these programmers more shit that they can sleep on
Give these biting cunts more shit that they can feast on

Money come and go out your life like the seasons
People do too sometimes without a reason
And it kind of seemed wrong when they took his life
Should of killed this dude, he's a fucking dick right

And maybe get some insight from Jesus, Allah, Jehova
Some will pray on Sunday some will spend it hungover
Whether drunk or sober, hearts is getting colder, globe is getting warmer
Maybe thats some karma for real

[Hook]
Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Most people all talk, no action
Over that shit and numerate it to a fraction
They be on the internet having little word wars
Typing in their 2 cents acting like it's worth more

Tell you how to surf, when they've never touched a surfboard
Dissing Tiger Woods when they're fucking even worse whores
You get the urge wanna go and call them out
Making you just as bad as them by all accounts

And what it all amounts to ain't shit
Working at a slave ship hit by the same whip
As the person that you're arguing with
While the people that you arguing about all remain rich

Say laters to this try focus on your own life
Then you see haitians with no home no lights
Make you grateful for what you have
But got to make you wonder if you really are giving what you can

[Hook]
Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Ricky Gervais]
We all wake up and we go "oh, I ache, I'm not 18 anymore
You know, I'm thirty ni- you know, I'm in my thirties, I'm not-"
But so what, at least I've got my health. And if you haven't got your health-
If you've got one leg, at least I haven't got two legs missing
And if you have lost both legs and both arms, just go "at least I'm not dead!"
I'd rather be dead...

[Hook]
Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh[Hook: Ruby Frost]
Easy, what you want
Could be another thing, it is a power of its own
Easy, what you've got
One minute it is here, and then another it is gone, oh
And higher, and higher, I'm going on a limb
The wire, the wire, is growing very thin
And you can call it, but I'm never gonna wanna leave
The wire the wire, though it's giving up on me

[Verse 1: David Dallas]
It's time to knuckle down
No time to run around, acting crazy its real
Nothing Fugazi until I'm Swayze in ghost
I'm trying things that seem fucking crazy to most
As kiwi kids it ain't in our nature to boast
So we be playing things down we be making jokes
In case we choke rather make out like we didn't try
Than bare the shame that we built a plane that didn't fly
Livin' lies, man if only we could live a little
The end might not be great but it was good in the middle
You may get chastised but the work you did outlives you
And if you did it from the heart know that they'll forgive you
May nobody forbid you from this first step
On a high wire it could be your worst yet
It could be your best i walked on it once or twice
Thought i'd stumble to my death
Though I feel it getting thinner
I'm still standing on the edge

[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Dallas]
Yeah, attracted to this life
Or the facade of it
Ain't what it seems, still I wanna be a part of it
I carry some scars from it
You never know if you can carry a film if you've never been the star of it
Put a couple large on it, going for the Oscar nom
Thought I'd be happy with the Emmys then you got it wrong
I had to leave 'em behind although we got along guess the trains leaving today
You're either off or on
Dunno if I got it wrong I live with it though
Play some good defense
Stick with it though, best shape of my life
I'm sick with it though and up on the main stage
I bought tickets though and I can't quit the show
Though I know its such a long way down, been such a long way now
That I've forgotten who I used to be
Now doing this is the only thing that's true to me[Verse 1]

Know the boy D-Double do it all day
Get the messing with his tracks, no foreplay
Seems simple now but it wasn't always
Used to sit up in the Pap High hallways
Teacher put me there saying that I talk to much
I thought I knew it all but I never knew much
I come to school late because my form room sucked
And we hang out by the canteen all through lunch
Young teen with a pac(men)tality
No dream I can make reality
All I care about is popularity
Trying to pass Jessica trying to get a touch
And a Mufti day try them with some new Chucks
Try them with some new Nikes or something
They didn't give a fuck about assignments or nothing
Didn't make music even though I loved it
Scared to try , high to shy get busted(?)

[Hook: Che Fu]

So I sit on the sideline
Despite in my time
If I could be in their shoes
The things that id do
But wishing won't get you know where
Dont be scared to go there
If you sit in my wake
Do it the right way
(yeah ya)

[Verse 2: David Dallas]

No I wasn't in the first fifteen
Wasn't in the choir, Never learned to sing
Couldn't play an instrument or pluck a string
Or the little rich kid whos dad bought him a car
A regular dude fading in to the background
Never took center stage, didn't really stand out
I remember school TalentQuest
We would hang out see this other dude rap
Then he'd be the man around E block
For like the next two weeks, scoring all of the chicks
While these Diggas my mom bought, are falling to bits
And I'm off in detention, for ignoring Mr. Smitts
And this bitch mocked me in class for having big lips
It was a hard knock life for a kid
Till I realized that a life isn't lived
If you're worrying about what other people might think of it
Don't sleep on this little boy's raps because he might be a hit

[Hook]

[Hook Extra: Che Fu]

Dont let it go by
There ain't no reason known why
Youre waiting around
You could be a star
Just watch from a far
Just stop waiting around

[Verse 3: David Dallas]

School finished did a little bit of growing up
But it wasn't like music was blowin' up
Shy as ever figured out I had to grow some nuts
And put my self out there, so they know whats up
And yeah I was pretty scared what they might say
They FENZ at it and say its bad in a nice way
Or I wasn't doing it the right way
But there ain't no right or wrong
Got one life to live and it ain't that long
So you gotta stay strong, gotta stay on
Another day sittin', wishin is another day gone
Another day doing dishes, or just mowing up the lawn
Coludve been another day that another star was born

[Hook]

[Outro: David Dallas]

Dont be scared man
Dont worry too much about what people are going to say
Because at the end of the day
The only person who still thinks about that stuff is you
Ya know?Verse 1
278, you already know
It ain't really much to look at but it's home
Used to bus from the old bar which was to go
Into town rolling through Otahuhu depot
Thinking how we ended up here
Yeah no secret theres some people doing tough here
Could be rough here, if your parents come here from an island
In the hope of a better life for the child and an education
But they ain't got time to keep an eye on 'em
They workin' every day, they won't even see retirement
School don't teach you to deal with this environment
Another poly kid left to his own devices
And you look at what they reinforce
When they talk about us doing crime, playing sports
Standing in the dole line, or in the court
Think it don't affect us all?

Hook
Look at boys from the Southside
If you looking from the outside
Some scared to death when they see us
Cos every 10/7 they featurin'
Boys from the Southside
But we represent it with pride
When you feel you come from the bottom
Til you reach the top, ain't no stopping 'em
Boys from the Southside

Verse 2
It's about time, all the people talking shit now
Figure out why, this town is so influential
The real melting pot, immigration central
Culture, our knives be so instrumental
But still we never acting like we too damn special
Don't ever let nobody say we all just criminals
Round here it ain't all that simple

Raised there, struggle city a place where
A population, whorey five slash amazing
Most of 'em work 9 to 5 to pay rent
Go to church and sing songs and pray for better days
Better pay and a better location
The kids choose sport over education
And dream that one day the All Blacks take them
Somewhere, exposed to the drugs and the gang life
Think it's cool to get involved, end up in the can right
Got a lot of teens pushing prams before they see life
Cos their parents did the same thing so it seems right
Seem right to say the same, a product of pride over law so
When they got my back like the tat on my torso
That's why I give back, ask where my awards go

Hook 2:
To the schools in the Southside
If you're looking for me outside
Some scared of death when they see us
Then they talk shit when they leave
Like the boys from the Southside
Are good for nothing so fuck 'em
Give 'em no chance just cuff 'em
If it was up to the cops and the judges
The boys from the Southside

Verse 3
Would be outlined
Shot on sight
Here we got crime in the area
If you got shine then it's any up
Only cos we broke tryna get our accounts right
What's going in our minds, six words
How we gonna get by
I dont know exactly
But we ain't gonna wait in the dole line

Yeah 267 landed a aeroplane
Back when my parents came
From the islands
With a Bible and a pair of J's (yeah Jandals)
Trying to set a better way to get our educa-
Tions that we found street smarts and a free pass to the green pastures
Around these parts we were blessed with the big heart
That can see past all the eat asses
Aw, what you thought I was gonna talk
All about walking with gangs where the drugs be
How about I touch on how
David Lange ran the country, right where the thugs be
John Walker might run at the tops, long distance
Scott Dixon on the track now
Rather a hand up than a hand down
All my people stand down

Hook:
When I'm back out the Southside
Black white with the brown pride
Even yellows part of the picture
The boy all ups a perfect mixture
Here up out the southside
Everywhere this shit til the death
Walk with my head held high to the sky
My T-shirt say Southside til I die
The boy from the Southside

The bodies outlined with an aura
You can see it so clearly
I mean it looks like a (?) dairy
Or a Scorpians home crowd cheering
Or a Otahuhu mums eyes tearing
Not when the sons graduated from OC
26 to the 27 to the 29 of the 09 that's where the home be[Verse]

Been with me through the worst and the best
Swear on this beat in my chest
I'mma be there in a sec if you call
Give you my all
I stand tall, cause you make me believe
Even when it's dark, I can light it up
Nothin we can't achieve
And I've been breathing these sighs of relief
When I was feelin my chance was blown
My team lets me know I'm not alone
I feel stronger than Kanye, because of you
And I'd take a million more L's to get the W
And when I get it, betta believe that I'mma smother you
Covet you, what's mine is yours – know how your brother do
Just to show you I owe you and nah this ain't no other dude
Never change, never strange, round you I'm so comfortable for real

[Chorus x2]

So when you see me put ya hands together
If you really down with me I'll be your man forever
When you feel a little weak I'm right here remember
Let these people talk, they can be mad forever, ever

[Verse]

I never, knew I could feel this way
We don't reveal or say, but even the coolest exteriors can get peeled away
Under certain situations, feelin ya limitations
Man it seem like god couldn't overcome the shit I'm facin
I'm cavin, never sayin that it's your help I need
But you came and, saved a brother who thinkin selfishly
I failed to see, all sad feelings temporary
And like fine wine.. the shit gets better with time
So shine baby shine, do this for you as much as me
Rewind baby wind, what we've been through will make us kings
And this game got valleys and peaks
Walls, barriers, seas
I ain't scared to fall cause I know that you carryin me

[Chorus x2]
So when you see me put ya hands together
If you really down with me I'll be your man forever
When you feel a little weak I'm right here remember
Let these people talk, they can be mad forever, everAVerse]
Gimme that mic fool, lemme get a few things off the chest
I remember them, student days put me to the test yes
Actually you could say, that I put myself through it
How could I be helpful to mum if I ain't sail through a
Tertiarty institute, older brother, sister who
Did it, so you ain't shit if you ain’t in the livin room
With “bachelor” on the wall, this plaque is awarded for
What ? I don’t know shit.. back chillin on the wall
Outside of the guidance counsellors office
And he sittin askin if I know, what I’m really wantin out of life
See I don't Know what I want to do or pursue
I just want to make moves with the crew to hit

[Hook]
Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time
When we hit the Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time

So you gotta reach for that money
Keep receipts for that money
They gonn’ leach all that money
When you least need it, but we

Hit the Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time

[Bridge]

[Verse]
Year 00, now I’m outside in the big bad world
Tryna make some dollars maybe I could bag a bad girl
What, what you wanna do ? still don’t really know
So just grabbed the university brochure and I chose
Somethin at a whim, I.T? Yeah, I like computer games
“but I heard their pay got lower since Y2K?”.. fuck it
I suck at economics and accounting, so BCom is out
B Bursary cut down all the choices, ain't no medicine or engineering for me
Now the only small problem is the fees
Cost 3 and a half to 5 over 4 years
Yeah its steep but you shoulda tried to save before you’re here
You gonna need money for text books on top of that here
Here’s a discount card for Shads cheapen up your beer
Don’t fear, if you ain’t got no money little Dave
Here’s a student loan form, you can sign your life away to

[Hook]
Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time
When we hit the Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time

So you gotta reach for that money
Keep receipts for that money
They gon leach all that money
When you least need it, but we

Hit the Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time[Verse 1: David Dallas]
Yeah, yeah, I'm high upon a new wave of confidence
I'm trying to ride it to a few different continents
Known in the country that I'm from but anonymous
To most of the populous and dominant
Awkward places, I'm from New Zealand and I'm use to seeing different faces
And they don't ever turn the radio to different stations
I gotta do it though cause Mum's getting sick of waiting
When I was young she used to tell me "Have some fucking patience"
But she loved the baby boy, raise the bar like I'm on roids with my game playing with the joysticks
I'm grateful for the voice I've been given
Big boy now my purple whip about to have all of the sort of bugs flicking
...sippin' vodka soda with the twist in
...Jamiroquai plying I don't say it should be different it's still hip hop in the vein
Smurnoff in the brain, always been a cool dude I'll let you know if you can say

[Hook]
I'm kicking back, feeling good on a Friday
Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way
Know that I stay
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
I'm in a good mood, don't mess in my high, things are looking up
You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Bitch I’m caught up in a daze, caught up with these polices again
Bitch, got these swisshers and these vehicles we chiefin up in
That’s why they hate
Custom colours, has my niece end up on 6's
If you ever tryna' find me, I prolly' be water whippin'
Cookin' up and cuttin'
Open up baggy, stuff em' like muffins
Out of dope, but joy yo prices ain't in my budget, so fuck it
I stuck em' up, and got on the highway
Freddie Gibbs get fried, like everyday is Friday
In the place I reside, I keep that iron cause them goons gonna' be lurking
Keep my dough spot popping and my boost phone twerkin'
Put me on the licking and anybody move, I'ma' murk em'
Knock em' out their shoes and give their ass the blues, that's for certain
Bitch, you purpin' n' you flirtin' with death, if you fuck of mine
For your shit to walk up and take your life, in this life of crime
In this life of mine I've tooken' away some; put my life on the line
Agents ask me for a statement, I decline

[Hook]

[Verse 3: David Dallas]
Yeah I'm sayin'
It’s all, they can never talk me down, deeply rooted in the ground
Way I spit it's so profound, know the sound like some shit you heard before
But it ain't everyone's a ... now but I'm using different paint man
I'm using different ink for the story, this is guts this is glory
It's the rush of performing, It's the slut when you're horny
It's the feeling that you get when you wake up in the morning
All that feeling that you get when the sun's dawning on another day
And you ain't seen your life another way
Working at the same job for next to nothing pay
Plugging away it's the dreams trying to hold this shit together
While the worst tuck in away, the same sick
Struggling it ain't no fame, one you looking back
But fuck if you ever ... try to ... from that
So why you see it like a vintage car
You put your all in your writing, I once ... you can rise
You talk about it with your friends as a symbol of a hard work
This is all of me sewing there looking that doing lenses
... it's probably right ... and my voice is so committed

[Hook][Intro]
Tint squad
Another fire & ice hit dog
Now I'm flying, about the lift-off

[Verse 1]
Sitting up at Harlem, eye of the hurricane
I hear back in NZ they callin' me the fuckin man
First one out of my country doing it in this manner
Make a lot of dudes green and mad, call them Bruce Banner
Couple screws loose, I could probably use two spanners
Girls come at me with stereo from the left and right
Two channels, you think you could live this life
But really could you handle leaving everything you know behind
If you knew that you might not make it over there
Might get ridiculed
Might struggle to make the ends meet and get a little food
Might have to go home with your tail between your legs
And hear that you were dreaming
Thinking you could make it over there, yea
If you with that, then we cut from the same cloth
Against all odds like Apple til it pays off
A lot of dudes say they would but they straight soft
Call me Phil Ivey, pulling cards if we face off
I'm about to take off and so is this girl here
I'm talkin' my career, she's talkin' her ???
Guess that deserves a beer, tell her to sip it baby
Don't really have time to kick it lately, I'm gone

[Hook]
I'm never going back, caution's in the wind
Give a fuck about the odds bro, I play to win, yea
But these people got no idea what I do
That's why they couldn't walk a mile wearing my shoes

Couldn't lace 'em up, couldn't make 'em look good
Don't nobody wanna bad movie when the book's good
But these people got no idea what I do
That's why they couldn't walk a mile wearing my shoes

[Verse 2]
A little bit of knowledge is a bad thing
Best you know the girl if you're gonna buy the damn ring
This the type of life to have to flippin' like a handspring
Or stretch your patience like a motherfucking hand string
I just do the damn thing, I don't really talk about it
Plowin' dudes off that pull these other people, walking around
Now I'm really pointing out that shit
You thinking an opportunity falls out the sky and you catch it?
You dead wrong, gotta be headstrong
Questions I get asked now are way too important for me to get wrong
I got my future at stake, the future estate
It's all about timing and this biz caught me two minutes late
Livin' out of suitcase for too many days
And miss the comforts of home in too many ways
But I make my own luck, because I've seen too many pray
And when it comes time for the bills, I have too many unpaid
Still just a simple man, buys like a histagram
Handsome motherfucker, take picture Instagram
Habitual line stepper, push it to the limit man
Damn, gotta line up to kick again, it's over

[Hook]
I'm never going back, caution's in the wind
Give a fuck about the odds bro, I play to win, yea
But these people got no idea what I do
That's why they couldn't walk a mile wearing my shoes

Couldn't lace 'em up, couldn't make 'em look good
Don't nobody wanna bad movie when the book's good
But these people got no idea what I do
That's why they couldn't walk a mile wearing my shoes

[Outro]
Couldn't walk a mile, couldn't walk a mile in these (3x)

If you ain't what you claim to be, better watch what you say to meI don't want the world, I want you!
One man band, walk to my own drum
Call me self-centered but it takes one and no one
Guess I had a one track mind from the start
Trying to make these songs get better at my craft
Get upon the charts maybe get a couple plaques
And in the process might break a couple hearts
Part of the game tho I said you told me
But things changed and I'm not the old me
Learned a few tricks of the trade
Learnt that I don't wanna be alone at the end of the day
Had to hit you on the phone everytime i was awake
Can't do it on my own, really need for you to stay
Tho you hear me say it alot
I'm busy doing this step further, and make it to the top
Since thay never expire, but for you i'd drop it all in a sec cause there is none higher

[Hook]
Pull the rug from underneath me, take away all that I made
Feel like all I need is you, for me to see another day
Pull the rug underneath me, take away all I possess
Feel like all I need is you, all I need is you
Cause I know you've seen, that the boy got big dreams
You might think that the only thing i serve is me
But I hang up my boots, make a promise to you
Cause the truth is I don't want the world, I want you!

Yeah! it don't come around often something like this
See, I think about the old me, there's nothing I miss
Sure, I had a good time along the way
Ain't living for the past tho, I'm living for today
Tryna make the best of all i can for me and you
And tomorrow's all good if I'm seeing you
Nah I'm never living you behind
A little bit of fame couldn't keep you from my mind!
Different time zones! still you keep me on the line
Checking out my watch sleep in my eyes
So don't be surprised if I show up by your side
Trying to talk about some plans
Get on one knee hope you offer up your hand
Trying to make you understand, I put nothing above you
Nowadays you're the person I look up to
World full of noise, I'm just tryna cut through
Thay can take it all, but I'm not giving up you!

[Hook]
Pull the rug from underneath me, take away all that I make
Feel like all I need is you, for me to see another day
Pull the rug underneath me, take away all I possess
Feel like all I need is you, all I need is you
Cause I know you've seen, that the boy got big dreams
You might think that the only thing i serve is me
But I hang up my boots, make a promise to you
Cause the truth is I don't want the world, I want you!
I just want you baby!
I don't want the world, I want you![Hook: Buff1 & David Dallas]
We got our eyes on success, mind on our goals
Making ends meet that's how the money folds
On the road doing shows, when it comes to how it goes we the pro's
We gotta stay level headed yeah, vision in the clouds
So world wide so we make our cities proud
Yeah we make our cities proud
And we want the finest things we allowed

[Verse 1: Buff 1]
Got a lot on my mind, need a lot in my pocket
Mike E gave me a shot and I shot like a rocket
Now I'm popping with models no sir rocking my bottles
My main thing so grown she be rocking my scado
You're just toddlers that follow whatever rappers say
Well I'm a rapper I say go to school and graduate
Hey if it's an ends to a means
If you got another plan man stick to your dreams
I know we all can't afford tuition in a school system like the ? fool wishing
But just know that success comes in the mind first
Shoot for the stars with guns blazing like Wyatt Earp
No matter the turf or the country that I rhyme
In that like mind this shine like high priced diamonds
And if you're realising what the nice life is
You can get us in the city for the right prices

[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Dallas]
My head to the asphalt, sipping on Jack though
Impressing chicks that ain't ever been to a rap show
She's trying to be down, she saying I got a mad flow
I see right through her I ain't trying to be sad though
It's all good though, we don't discriminate
She bumps George FM on the dinner dates
Dates swear deuces all into Real Estate
But this shit right here they can't imitate
It's the Bad Boy thing like Puff and B.I.G had
Can't You See, didn't Total sing that?
Really off the hook and I ain't gonna ring back
This retro classic's something to bring back
Always on that '80s shit, that some ladies shit
Me and Buff on that crazy shit
Aim high for the type of cash you can buy Mercedes with
In fact people in the ? that's for real

[Hook]*Liam Gallagher*
Because they obviously think they're too big and they obviously think they're bigger than the bands and fuck 'em. if they're not prepared to give you a decent sound so they can go and suck my cock

Chorus 2x
I feel like Oasis in 1995
Getting so wasted
Saying what’s on my mind
You should embrace it
Fuck all the fake shit
Telling everybody we're the best
Into their faces

*David Dallas*
I am feeling like Liam and Noel
Laced my Adidas' on strong
Never been scared to commit when everyone's feet getting cold
Me, I'm not worried at all, believe on my own talent
Not sharing the spotlight with them, I got no manners
Dudes are just no challenge, not striking, no balance
Either their beats whack or their rhymes all flow so average
I'm leavin' them like blur ??? shattered
You are hearing me killing shit, stop watching me toe tag it
Tryin' to be bigger than Lindsay Lohan's coke habit
So when I hit the stage your girl throw her clothes at it
You should take notes damn it, jammin' this Lennon and McCartney
Fuck all the false modesty, media can't harm me
Sayin what I wanna say, aiming for the top spot
Don't leave me for having everything that they have not got
Understand the reasons why they have to try and cock block
Supersonic of this gin and tonic, I do not stop

Chorus 2x
I feel like Oasis in 1995
Getting so wasted
Saying what’s on my mind
You should embrace it
Fuck all the fake shit
Telling everybody we're the best
Into their faces

*Tayyib Ali*
Okay, I'm popping is crazy, niggas say that I am loco
Now I'm fresh in SoHo, them ladies snappin' my photo
Hit the gas on a ride, they wanna act like I told you
I'll put my key in, we'll be eatin', couple spins and it's over
Yo, I will be getting it in, all my Philly shit chillin'
Yeah I grind by the hour but I've been hot for a minute
I'm just out for the day, puffin' and playing
Spending this money, we're doing the same
Crushin' the game, your girlfriend, she leaving ??? see her again
Yeah. That's something I can't control and there's one thing that I know
(what)
I am always on the roll, trying blow
Yeah I'm ten steps ahead, niggas better catch up instead of beefing for the bread
This shit ??? and I don't even try hard
In a good position so I got to pay my part
That young nigga from Philly you got your style from
Nineteen but I need thousands

Chorus 2x
I feel like Oasis in 1995
Getting so wasted
Saying what’s on my mind
You should embrace it
Fuck all the fake shit
Telling everybody we're the best
Into their faces

*The Kid Daytona*
The rap version oasis, crowd surfing on stages
Raging with machines, got my beats from a basement
Places that I grace my presence with
Outside American show me love, though I'm a ???
Left a print on my hand
???
Roll my name graffiti on a tram
Come and greet me when I land
Of this cloud I'm presently on
Every morning thank the heavenly lord
??? could really think of any
Now that she left ..
Smoking a cigar .. on a show
.. anywhere in the world ..
Shout out to D dot Dallas, an MC, that's how we stylin' from NY to AZ

Chorus 2x
I feel like Oasis in 1995
Getting so wasted
Saying what’s on my mind
You should embrace it
Fuck all the fake shit
Telling everybody we're the best
Into their facesDavid dallas (verse 1)

Yea if you come from where we come from
No we dont ever run from
Gettin money in a lump sum just to pay it back later
If the family need a favour then it ain't nothin major
Paper changes hands quicker then a dj hits the fader
Thats just how we do how we grew hard to understand
That as a sour youth mum explainin that you ain't allowed to choose
Your family's your family they gonna look out for you
Still a samoan boy dont forget about your roots
Growin up in AK where they dont forget their rugby boots
Didn't play much five-eighth i would play way more kurupt
And snoop play way more mobb deep boom boom say hey all my people who
Been goin against the grain but dont forget bout why we really do
What we do where we came from got our names from
People i lay next to in the ground when my day comes
Chance to make my music a gift for me that they brung
Think i ain't proud then you mistaken uce

David dallas (hook)

Thats just how we do how we're raised island roots auckland ways
People overseas wonder if i'll ever change
But i came from the future
Today is tomorrow
Thats why what ever we do
Then the world gonna follow (3x)
Celebrate it with my fam
Feel like we just hit the lotto
The world gonna follow (2x)
Man i came from NZ my today is their tomorrow

David dallas (verse 2)

I got dem laid back island genes
I dont need no drama
In my ie lavalava listenin to dear mama
With my peers sippin lagers reminiscin on the years
Made a tears that we shed for the departed disappeared
So for real rod see you when i get there
I still got some things that i need to tackle bout to get my headgear like im Thurston or Kronfeld man im certain
If things round here were perfect
Feel i'd be half the person
I was birthed in Middlemore for a reason
On any day in auckland could see all four seasons
So we're born believen the sky ain't the limit its just somethin to react to
Things are lookin cloudy now but the sun will crack through
Umbrella packed too you can read it like im tattoed
Proud of where im from it pulls me back like
A lasso laugh how we used to pay for sky before the rent
This that hamo that palagi pito saute aukilagi shit

Hook (2x)[Verse]
Ooooh, what a night this eve
With the homies Jordache and Aaron on the beat
It’s the C-O-N I, ain't come to play around
Steady tryna think, of a place we can take it now
Take it real slow, tryna be respectful too
So I just suggest it to you like
Do you wanna come sit over here and chill
See I got a friend that’ll serve us drinks until
He gets off, I kinda think that you’d be best off
Riding this thing out, there’ll be less cost
For you, and for me I get the bonus the best view
But I put the onus against you, no stress tho
You can make your mind up, what you wanna do
I’m doin me with this heineken, till the night is done
But theres no denyin I like your company
[Hook x2]
Can I get ya name and ya number say
Can I get a smile on ya face I’d pay
For a drink or two just get to know me
Don’t leave, no no no you gotta indulge me
[Verse]
Take a sip, go ahead
Nah I won’t take advantage if it go to your head
I’m opposed to that red wine
Just a little bit of that for me is bedtime
Won’t get ahead of myself
I’m tellin you i’m in for the long haul
Till the fat lady, singin the encore
On tour ? oh you really wanna know
See I don’t think you do, you just really wanna show
That you ain’t no, no no young h-o
Tryna hook up anything that’s in the place tho
No you ain’t gotta worry bout that
Cause if I thought it, I wouldn’t really sit around and chat
So just sit around and lap
The attention up, and don’t worry ain’t nobody gotta mention us
That ascension buzz cause we on the up and up
So when you see me lookin maybe you could pucker up
[Hook x2]
Can I get ya name and ya number say
Can I get a smile on ya face I’d pay
For a drink or two just get to know me
Don’t leave, no no no you gotta indulge me
[Bridge]
It seems you’ve been playing around
Tryna figure out, how I get down
But you know, know
It’s sweet if you stay right here
You got no idea
But I’ll show you though, I hope you know
[Hook x2]
Can I get ya name and ya number say
Can I get a smile on ya face I’d pay
For a drink or two just get to know me
Don’t leave, no no no you gotta indulge me[Verse 1]
From the pacific island of Samoa via Middlemore
And still as raw as the day a little boy was delivered on
Deliver non-fiction all real, no silicon
Been sitting on a goldmine the way I been killing songs
Underdog, but ain't trying to play this position long
The top cats is looking weak, but I feel gorilla strong
Ain't kidding dog King Kong ain't got shit on me
Word to Curren$y I'm flying but ain't got weed on me
You can catch me on a long haul
Riding Air New Zealand or Qantas
Me and Che hit the states with no sponsors
And accomplished more than more these fuckhead labels did
Even though they had untold grinds to pay for shit
Pushing trash indie bands whose resume's paper thin
That play South By once then never play again
I play to win, put money on the line I don't have
Then say "fuck it if I fail it ain't so bad"
Being broke, I'd rather take a risk than be a joke
Who thinks he's really living life when he ain't leaving home
I'm trying to see the world they just trying to meet some girls
And get in the club for free for a weekend splurge
See how quick they on my dick when I reemerge
On some Jean Grae shit, they just real gay pricks
D dot D A bitch, say it with authority
People asking what's good, I'm in that minority
You thinking music sucks now, they're in that majority
Ain't in no fraternity they probably in sororities
And we don't even have those where I'm from
People say the clocks ticking down 'til I blow up
I'm a time bomb but
Great stories don't always get told, ask Saigon
I just hope these songs click with people like a Nikon
Ironic, ’cause for that I need for them to click the icon
Hit the ‘Save As’ menu button, yeah the right one
Burn a fuckin' CD, chuck it on your Ipod
Play it in your car, this some shit you can vibe on
Shouts to Adidas, it's been a while since I had Nikes on
And anybody else who helped the bro to keep the lights on, yeah

[Outro: David Brent]
Life is just a series of peaks and troughs
And you don't know whether you're in a trough until you're climbing out
Or on a peak until you're coming down
That's it; you know, you'll never know what's around the corner, but it's all good, you know
"If you want the rainbow, you'll have to put up with the rain"
You know which 'philosopher' said that?
Dolly Parton. And people say she's just a big pair of tits[Verse 1: David Dallas]
Ice running through my veins, I’m the coldest
Give me half a chance I’ll be running with it like I stole it
You would notice if you paid attention properly, ain't playing the lottery
I work with better odds, my favorite game is Monopoly
You copy me, get it? Understand I’m a problem g
Ain’t no stopping me or my movement, man, this is prophecy
This is probably the reason they trying to Sarah Connor me
Or Edward Furlong in the sequel, but no apology
You ever hear inaudibly come from my lips
Like Beyonce at inaugurations, ain’t gonna say shit
Won't be no prerecording it either, I just give them the ether
Freddie up on the feature, you should know the procedure
Fool, don't act like you don't hear the chicks singing the song
Y'all made me a believer, out to get it at all costs
Like a young mob boss, go getter, going out like this was V for Vendetta
Trend setter, I'm the coldest

[Hook: David Dallas]
You're drawn to the side
S with the line, through it, bout to fall from the sky
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse at the time
What's the plan? Believe the world is mine
And my mentality is money orientated
Money orientated, anything for the paper
And my mentality is money orientated
Money orientated, anything for the paper

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Fuck the world and everything in it
Driveway full of pink slips, ain't a thing rented
And if we do push that rental then we got them things in it
454 in my motor, work with some change in it
Jumped off that label and started my own shit
Don't need no nigga to hold my dick, bitch, I'm all off my own flip
Say my attitude like Nicky from Casino
I'll probably die buried alive, Freddie Tarantino
Keep a shoe box full of rubber bands rocking dope, I'm racked up
Blue kush and fellatio, I lay back in my 'Lac truck
Every nigga from my hood tryina make 100 stacks plus
Eastside Gary niggas, boy, these actors get wrapped up
All I wanna do is smoke a stoggy and get loaded
And go fuck with my old bitch and my new ho got demoted
But once I whip this dick on her, she might just jump back on it
Got my dough ho and my blow right off the coast of California
Bitch, we robbing, bitch, you holding

[Hook]

[Verse 3: David Dallas]
Money orientated, legacy on my conscience
Long as I did it my way, then fuck it bro, I ain't bothered
Don't bother popping off with the lips
Like dropping the flame in a Molotov mix
Not in your best in-trest, lit fuse d.dot fuckin' flame thrower
Harder than the south beach when King James came over
Painted over your little tags with end to end burners
I've been a quick learner, to win, I went further
Push hard to drive like Sebastian Vettel
Put my foot to the floor so hard that I broke the pedal
Killing everything you think that I made a pact with the devil
Ain't no heart strings that you can pull on so fuck Geppetto
I'm my own puppet master, pour a glass of lager, sitting in mi casa
You ain't in my clasa, you bastards, I fathered your style, my ability
Got you sweating me but I never feel the humidity
My AC is on, nothing in this world that can take me on
So pump your breaks, be gone, I'm looking way beyond
What's within my reach, I'm tryina grow my wing span till I got down some beat
From Auckland City, the new Deli to Gary, Indiana
The world gonna be my oyster and don't come on a platter
If they don't wanna better than I do
Then I'mma keep taking it as long as I'm alive
To try stop me, man[Intro]
I got the new world in my view
On my journey I pursue
I said I'm running, running for the city
I got the new world in my view
I got the new world in my view
On my journey I pursue
Lord said I'm running, running for the city
I got the new world in my view

[Verse 1]
They ain't got no muscle, no hustle
No backbone, I stand alone
Not tripping, just saying, I'm different
Ain't hanging on the coattails of the next man
Passport in my left hand, thinking that you are next
Heck, hope you ain't holding your breath, man
Cause I'm out here, I'm hungry, I don't play around, trust me
Ain't hexed my drive since my Honda Civic got rusty
And my girl said she loved me, it's funny
Just thinking back, study hard for that 9 to 5
Like I thought that I'd be good with that
I was dreaming, still dreaming, spoil it on me like Willie Beaman
Still performing like Al Pachino, we stuck around in tuxedos
With my peoples, we growing up 'stead of seeing others slowing up
Tint squad, we throwing up, every time we showing up

[Hook]
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with you now
They don’t wanna give it up
We gon' make it out
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with them, yeah
They don't wanna give it up
We don't make them ask it

[Verse 2]
It don't get no greater, feel like I'm on fire
Feel like I'm Johnny Storm, feel like I'm volatile
Explosive, get close enough to notice
Your girl act out of character when she see me approaching
Ain't pouching I'm just saying it's nothing
You punching above your weight, I'm something
She ain't seen no substitute in that A team
That's B.A., Baracus, that BS, that whackness
Get no play in my axis, make 'em jump like AJ Hackett
Guarantee you in these boots they couldn't walk one mile
I really need to go and hang it up like a drunk dial
So behind the times they should probably rock a sundial
Shattering their dreams, I could make Big Pun smile
Music from the soul, don't need them to help me
If they fiending for the flash, they should take another selfie
Said I'm running, I'm running like Mo Farah so dapper
Swear the whole world could go against me, it don't matter, man

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm on the chase
Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place
We ain't got much to lose
I wanna taste
Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place
We ain't got much to lose

[Hook][Verse 1]

Know the boy D-Double do it all day
Get the messing with his tracks, no foreplay
Seems simple now but it wasn't always
Used to sit up in the Pap High hallways
Teacher put me there saying that I talk to much
I thought I knew it all but I never knew much
I come to school late because my form room sucked
And we hang out by the canteen all through lunch
Young teen with a pac(men)tality
No dream I can make reality
All I care about is popularity
Trying to pass Jessica trying to get a touch
And a Mufti day try them with some new Chucks
Try them with some new Nikes or something
They didn't give a fuck about assignments or nothing
Didn't make music even though I loved it
Scared to try , high to shy get busted(?)

[Hook: Che Fu]

So I sit on the sideline
Despite in my time
If I could be in their shoes
The things that id do
But wishing won't get you know where
Dont be scared to go there
If you sit in my wake
Do it the right way
(yeah ya)

[Verse 2: David Dallas]

No I wasn't in the first fifteen
Wasn't in the choir, Never learned to sing
Couldn't play an instrument or pluck a string
Or the little rich kid whos dad bought him a car
A regular dude fading in to the background
Never took center stage, didn't really stand out
I remember school TalentQuest
We would hang out see this other dude rap
Then he'd be the man around E block
For like the next two weeks, scoring all of the chicks
While these Diggas my mom bought, are falling to bits
And I'm off in detention, for ignoring Mr. Smitts
And this bitch mocked me in class for having big lips
It was a hard knock life for a kid
Till I realized that a life isn't lived
If you're worrying about what other people might think of it
Don't sleep on this little boy's raps because he might be a hit

[Hook]

[Hook Extra: Che Fu]

Dont let it go by
There ain't no reason known why
Youre waiting around
You could be a star
Just watch from a far
Just stop waiting around

[Verse 3: David Dallas]

School finished did a little bit of growing up
But it wasn't like music was blowin' up
Shy as ever figured out I had to grow some nuts
And put my self out there, so they know whats up
And yeah I was pretty scared what they might say
They FENZ at it and say its bad in a nice way
Or I wasn't doing it the right way
But there ain't no right or wrong
Got one life to live and it ain't that long
So you gotta stay strong, gotta stay on
Another day sittin', wishin is another day gone
Another day doing dishes, or just mowing up the lawn
Coludve been another day that another star was born

[Hook]

[Outro: David Dallas]

Dont be scared man
Dont worry too much about what people are going to say
Because at the end of the day
The only person who still thinks about that stuff is you
Ya know?Verse 1
278, you already know
It ain't really much to look at but it's home
Used to bus from the old bar which was to go
Into town rolling through Otahuhu depot
Thinking how we ended up here
Yeah no secret theres some people doing tough here
Could be rough here, if your parents come here from an island
In the hope of a better life for the child and an education
But they ain't got time to keep an eye on 'em
They workin' every day, they won't even see retirement
School don't teach you to deal with this environment
Another poly kid left to his own devices
And you look at what they reinforce
When they talk about us doing crime, playing sports
Standing in the dole line, or in the court
Think it don't affect us all?

Hook
Look at boys from the Southside
If you looking from the outside
Some scared to death when they see us
Cos every 10/7 they featurin'
Boys from the Southside
But we represent it with pride
When you feel you come from the bottom
Til you reach the top, ain't no stopping 'em
Boys from the Southside

Verse 2
It's about time, all the people talking shit now
Figure out why, this town is so influential
The real melting pot, immigration central
Culture, our knives be so instrumental
But still we never acting like we too damn special
Don't ever let nobody say we all just criminals
Round here it ain't all that simple

Raised there, struggle city a place where
A population, whorey five slash amazing
Most of 'em work 9 to 5 to pay rent
Go to church and sing songs and pray for better days
Better pay and a better location
The kids choose sport over education
And dream that one day the All Blacks take them
Somewhere, exposed to the drugs and the gang life
Think it's cool to get involved, end up in the can right
Got a lot of teens pushing prams before they see life
Cos their parents did the same thing so it seems right
Seem right to say the same, a product of pride over law so
When they got my back like the tat on my torso
That's why I give back, ask where my awards go

Hook 2:
To the schools in the Southside
If you're looking for me outside
Some scared of death when they see us
Then they talk shit when they leave
Like the boys from the Southside
Are good for nothing so fuck 'em
Give 'em no chance just cuff 'em
If it was up to the cops and the judges
The boys from the Southside

Verse 3
Would be outlined
Shot on sight
Here we got crime in the area
If you got shine then it's any up
Only cos we broke tryna get our accounts right
What's going in our minds, six words
How we gonna get by
I dont know exactly
But we ain't gonna wait in the dole line

Yeah 267 landed a aeroplane
Back when my parents came
From the islands
With a Bible and a pair of J's (yeah Jandals)
Trying to set a better way to get our educa-
Tions that we found street smarts and a free pass to the green pastures
Around these parts we were blessed with the big heart
That can see past all the eat asses
Aw, what you thought I was gonna talk
All about walking with gangs where the drugs be
How about I touch on how
David Lange ran the country, right where the thugs be
John Walker might run at the tops, long distance
Scott Dixon on the track now
Rather a hand up than a hand down
All my people stand down

Hook:
When I'm back out the Southside
Black white with the brown pride
Even yellows part of the picture
The boy all ups a perfect mixture
Here up out the southside
Everywhere this shit til the death
Walk with my head held high to the sky
My T-shirt say Southside til I die
The boy from the Southside

The bodies outlined with an aura
You can see it so clearly
I mean it looks like a (?) dairy
Or a Scorpians home crowd cheering
Or a Otahuhu mums eyes tearing
Not when the sons graduated from OC
26 to the 27 to the 29 of the 09 that's where the home beYeah, yeah, yeah!
We gonna make it to the top, it won't be long
So get it right, get it right!
Don’t get it wrong, get it wrong!
We gonna make it to the top, it won’t be long!

Yeah, feeling like today I’ve been to hell and back
Told my girl start cooking dinner and pull out the welcome mat
Can’t nobody tell me jack, radio was hella whack
So I turn that shit off for the drive home
Tape adapter plugged into the iphone
Now I’m up in my zone, feeling like a mother fucking cyclone
I could do whatever I set my sights on
Step through the front door like honey I’m home
See those Nikes on the floor, you reckon someone would buy those?
Grab up all this useless shit, lets log into TradeMe
Get rid of it all babe, can’t nobody cage me
Upper-class dude for a change, bit sick of all this shit
This job these gigs is all the same
But sick of all this pay, going on this place.. I don’t even wanna stay at
I think I go insane, you got a dream you need to chase that
We needa bounce asap, they say you only get one shot
Believe I’m gonna take that, and make that, yeah!

Chorus:
Woah, no more sitting round
Wishing things were different down here
Man, I’m feeling like a change!
It's time to start lookin' round, start lookin' round, start lookin' round!
Woah, no more sittin' round
Wishing things were different down here
Man, I’m feeling like today
It's time to start lookin round, start lookin round
Start lookin round

Yeah, let me take you back a couple years
Way before I met a couple peers, a couple years
Before I knew that rapping could be a career
Met a girl
Type of chick that probably turned some brothers queer
My mates said she was bad news
I wasn’t smart enough to hear
All advice is going in
One in out the other ear
All my cash gone and her hands
On another pair
Of shoes or some food or a subtle hair, color change
She all in my ear, saying music is just fun and games
Telling me to grow up, that all my mates are fucking lames
I’m caught in the middle, drinking booze just to numb the brain
She’s so insecure to something, well and she just complains
Unhappy with, her, life, looking for someone to blame
Too lazy to go get it,wishes she could coast the fame
Claiming she don’t need me
But she’s bluffing like a poker game
It’s insane that I stuck around at all, misery love company
Man, I’m better on my own!

Chorus:
Woah, no more sitting round
Wishing things were different down here
Man, I’m feeling like a change!
It's time to start lookin round, start lookin round, start lookin round
Woah, I ain’t taking no more shit from this bitch
Im bout to exit quick, feeling good today
It's time to start lookin' round, start lookin' round, start lookin' roundYeah

I said it's D dot D A double L A S
She just thinking LMFAO, tell that she ain't well impressed
Cause we ain't on telly yet, ain't getting those spins like
Rihanna or Umbrella yet, so she acting celibate
But I’m in my element, I don’t take that shit to heart
I like proving them wrong just to make myself look smart
They see the future as a blur to me, is looking sharp
My money's on me, you should get in from the start
So we order 4 shots of raw Jäger, while the bottle pours
Think of how it's gonna feel, when you know you got it all
Cause we on the bottom floor, looking at the top and all
People say we crazy, but they just bet on all the balls
They just wish for things to fall into their lap
I’m on a mission for it I won’t sleep and pause until it happens
Baby quit your chit and chatter, yap and kick back and handle the shot
In a couple years you won't believe you meet us in this spot

So you should take a picture, caaaaa chick
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit
And say this... You were down when they weren’t
When no one gave a damn what we did
Here we are, pouring out shots at the bar
Swearing one day we’ll be stars...
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit

So take a flick, remember it in a couple years
When you see dudes, resembling us
Then run and tell your friends that you met us, it was nuts
We poured some drinks and party till the sun came up
See it ain't even a thing, that we ain't being a bang
And I ain’t really no singer, ain't really no king
I’m just a simple man, just tryin' to do really big things
From the land flightless birds, 'bout to grow really big wings
And girl I really do think that truth comes out the more that we drink
Wouldn’t tell you this stuff otherwise I’d probably feel stink
But you caught me on an off day, or is it an on day
Shit, I dont even know its been a long day
Barman pass the bombay, plus one for my lady friend
Make a mental note of this, things won't be the same again
When you see our names again, they gonna be up in lights
Then this here'll be history, for now is just another night

So take a picture, caaaaa chick
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit
And say this... You were down when they weren’t
When no one gave a damn what we did
Here we are, pouring out shots at the bar
Swearing one day we’ll be stars...
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit[Hook: Ruby Frost]
Easy, what you want
Could be another thing, it is a power of its own
Easy, what you've got
One minute it is here, and then another it is gone, oh
And higher, and higher, I'm going on a limb
The wire, the wire, is growing very thin
And you can call it, but I'm never gonna wanna leave
The wire the wire, though it's giving up on me

[Verse 1: David Dallas]
It's time to knuckle down
No time to run around, acting crazy its real
Nothing Fugazi until I'm Swayze in ghost
I'm trying things that seem fucking crazy to most
As kiwi kids it ain't in our nature to boast
So we be playing things down we be making jokes
In case we choke rather make out like we didn't try
Than bare the shame that we built a plane that didn't fly
Livin' lies, man if only we could live a little
The end might not be great but it was good in the middle
You may get chastised but the work you did outlives you
And if you did it from the heart know that they'll forgive you
May nobody forbid you from this first step
On a high wire it could be your worst yet
It could be your best i walked on it once or twice
Thought i'd stumble to my death
Though I feel it getting thinner
I'm still standing on the edge

[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Dallas]
Yeah, attracted to this life
Or the facade of it
Ain't what it seems, still I wanna be a part of it
I carry some scars from it
You never know if you can carry a film if you've never been the star of it
Put a couple large on it, going for the Oscar nom
Thought I'd be happy with the Emmys then you got it wrong
I had to leave 'em behind although we got along guess the trains leaving today
You're either off or on
Dunno if I got it wrong I live with it though
Play some good defense
Stick with it though, best shape of my life
I'm sick with it though and up on the main stage
I bought tickets though and I can't quit the show
Though I know its such a long way down, been such a long way now
That I've forgotten who I used to be
Now doing this is the only thing that's true to meI'm in zone, yea

Stay prepared for the up and downs, life is like a see-saw
Some say it's a bitch, man I couldn't agree more
One minute you're on top, then you're in the ER
One minute she wants you, then she wants to leave

All I can do is take the good with the bad and keep on
Gotta work hard, gotta give the fans the mean songs
Give these programmers more shit that they can sleep on
Give these biting cunts more shit that they can feast on

Money come and go out your life like the seasons
People do too sometimes without a reason
And it kind of seemed wrong when they took his life
Should of killed this dude, he's a fucking dick right

And maybe get some insight from Jesus, Allah, Jehova
Some will pray on Sunday some will spend it hungover
Whether drunk or sober, hearts is getting colder, globe is getting warmer
Maybe thats some karma for real

[Hook]
Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Most people all talk, no action
Over that shit and numerate it to a fraction
They be on the internet having little word wars
Typing in their 2 cents acting like it's worth more

Tell you how to surf, when they've never touched a surfboard
Dissing Tiger Woods when they're fucking even worse whores
You get the urge wanna go and call them out
Making you just as bad as them by all accounts

And what it all amounts to ain't shit
Working at a slave ship hit by the same whip
As the person that you're arguing with
While the people that you arguing about all remain rich

Say laters to this try focus on your own life
Then you see haitians with no home no lights
Make you grateful for what you have
But got to make you wonder if you really are giving what you can

[Hook]
Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Ricky Gervais]
We all wake up and we go "oh, I ache, I'm not 18 anymore
You know, I'm thirty ni- you know, I'm in my thirties, I'm not-"
But so what, at least I've got my health. And if you haven't got your health-
If you've got one leg, at least I haven't got two legs missing
And if you have lost both legs and both arms, just go "at least I'm not dead!"
I'd rather be dead...

[Hook]
Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh[Chorus]
Got enough to go around what goes up ain’t coming down
Baby I’m running it light it up, light it up
Puff that shit, if your girl playing f*ck that b*tch
There's forks in the road, but hands on the wheel won't let it go
Show you how, what goes up
Ain’t coming down, coming down

[Verse 1]
Swear I don’t’ give a damn, eighty five kilogram, 6 foot 2 complex of a little man
Always got something to prove nothing to lose
Dudes just browsing the net for something to do, I’m really not f*cking with you
If Ain’t got no ambition bro then im cuttin you loose, it’s like Chris Brown chuckin the duece..... when they saw YE.. on a suit
Tell your girl come f*ck with the dude
NZ finest, king David bitch, NZ's highness im in harlem now that's NZ minus
Still I’m giving New York NZ-itis
That ill that sick that killer dog, make em all notice the D like im Dilla dog your girl eyeing my D like you been involved, it's Ray Allen for three I can hit it dog
Spittin on it anyone who think otherwise
Why these other dudes stay writing lullabies
Can’t sleep on my shit keep you up at night, I can't cut the lights,would you love it right

[Chorus]
Got enough to go around what goes up ain’t coming down
Baby I’m running it light it up, light it up
Puff that shit, if your girl playing up, f*ck that b*tch
Theres forks in the road, but hands on the wheel won't let it go
Show you how, what goes up
Ain’t coming down, coming down

[Verse 2]
They say I got the hemisphere on my shoulders, now couple dudes acting colder
But I got this rum and cola, so f*ck that I ain't paying no of mine
Extend your arm to shake, i'll extend my arm for a clothes line
I ain’t got no time, music is the slow grind
Cosigns don't mean shit when it show time, sound so hungry dudes thinkin that I don't dine, you ain't busy livin bro maybe you should go die
Sounds harsh but I got friends in hospital beds, who would give it all to have your problems instead
So stop sweating the small stuff all could be yours cuz, im tryin to find a place to rest my head on the tour bus
I do this for all us,shy half cast in the class scared to try but dont wanna come last
Who woulda thought man, mum thinks rappers just talkin'
Yanks mention Oaktown when I say Auckland , nah there ain’t champagne bottes uncorkin', I’m still on the beers with a couple of my horsemen
Still doing the half the things, People just talking, runnin' in the shoes motherfuckers couldn't walk in

[Chorus]

[Verse 3] - Buckshot
The life of a hustler, street survivor I have acomplished constant trials and tribulations my patience, prove...we are an oasis
Face it
Melaton mind criminal crime, peace on my head mean peace of mind when, I don't gotta see no violence, read no violence
Got....no island when I say I stay high in the trees
Eye on my enemies dying to squeeze , see OP see OG's and hope we OD for dope and more cheese, rats in traps they call traps perhaps they all black and back they own fact but, fall back dont fall off, fuck swag when you died and the black bag hauled off
Nine eleven dialing for heaven they wildin milk and honey its funny the devil is smilin’
With a smirk ...jerk .. get it work get it ..

[Chorus]AA
