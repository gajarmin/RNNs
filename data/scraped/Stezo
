It was this girl I met long time ago
Well I was dressed to impress on my way to a show
I had my Balley's clean, my pants were creased
Like Mastercard, I couldn't leave my house without my piece
Put on my coat, started high-stepping down the block
All souped up to go to the jam and rock
My boys pulled up and asked did I want a lift
I said, "Yeah trooper, that would be kind of swift"
So they gave me a ride, I walked right into the place
When I stepped in there, there was this fly girl in my face
I introduced myself, we got acquainted
Told her my name and she damn near fainted
Sat down togther and watched the show
The show was over, and it was finally time to go
So like a gentlemen, let the girl out the door first
Looked at her big boobs, it was about to burst
That really drove me crazy, we walked up her house
She sat down on the bed and took off her blouse
I started kissing her, and then she got sweaty
Looked her eye to eye and said "Honey are you ready?"
So off went her clothes, she was hot as fire
I said, "You wanna do it? Whatever you desire!"
I tried to put my thing in, she said "Hell no"
But if she does anything, she'll have to go low
Jumped up quick, I told the girl to leave
Said said "Why so soon I got to leave Mr. Steve?"
I said, "Honey, I know you're really on fire
And getting burnt isn't my biggest desire"
So she got mad and walked away out the back
I said, "Please sweetheart, won't you please come back?"
She walked out and I slammed the door
And yo that was the last I seen of that whore

	"Girls, girls, girls girls, girls I can't ignore" (Scratched 2x)

"Aiight Ste, on the strength man, you told everybody about the time
You dissed a girl, now tell everybody about the time a girl dissed you"

Well, I called her up the next day
She said "Yo Stezo I have something to say"
I said, "Please, I'm coming over to kiss you"
She said, "Come on, I'm gonna diss you"
Threw on some clothes and jumped on the 3
Got to the spot, some brothers looking at me
Headed upstairs, all eyes were on my pockets
Scoping my rings, my watch, and my locket
Rushed upstairs to use the telephone
Called the girl up, and yo, she wasn't home
Talked to her moms, her moms said she was fed up
Little do you know boy, you've been set up
Slowly but surely, turned around and seen eyes
And then I heard mom yo scream "Suprise!"
Then they pulled out jammies and put 'em to me
Then I thought, "Yeah, they're gonna do me"
Had no place to run, I just jetted
Heard brothers scream, "Stezo, you're gonna get it!"
Jumped in a cab and told the driver to speed
Then I got home and I forgot my keys
Tried to sneak in but the landlord caught me
Riffing so hard that he damn near fought me
Snuck in the back and locked the door
Turned on the tube and cracked a case of Coors

	"Girls, girls, girls girls, girls I can't ignore" (Scratched 2x)[Verse 1]
Extra extra, read all about it
It's me Stezo that has been doubted
I came to make you move and groove and get down
There's no way that the crowd can sit down
Off the record, this is the anthe-num
And if you're dry, I came to damp 'em
Keep dancing, all night's the minimum
To the dance floor, I'm sending 'em
Sweating and regretting that I'm the best
I'm putting dancers to the maximum test
Using and confusing beats that you've never heard
Protect my rhymes cause my rhymes are conserved
I'm your hero, not no zero
Just call me "Stezo the Fly Negro"
It's time to me to earn
So get up, cause it's my turn

[Verse 2]
Keep it to a low tone as I bring it home
This is a jam for the rhyme stone
It's an invention made up by the Stezo
I'm dropping beats on you like playing ceelo
So won't you listen and learn and keep gawking it
While the track is playing you keep talking it
Keep rocking the phone just like a cradle
Leaving you dancers on the dance floor fatal
Now pay attention my friend and let me rock this
With the 18 wheeler you can't block this
It's something crazy for the new '89ers
Whether you're a senior citizen or a minor
Another Stezo-E production making progress
Against another rapper, there's no contest
The way I'm rocking, it's my concern
Pay attention, cause it's my turn

[Verse 3]
Well on your marks, get set, it's ready let's go
Yo I'm the rap master that they call Stezo
Every time I get rhymeing, my voice gets clearer
Come up to front and you start to stare
At me, and yo I'm like acne
I pop to your face so don't try to zap me
Just listen and learn, wait your turn, step off
Or what I'm saying, is that you're really soft
Half to giggle, does it look like I'm joking?
Just like a Newport, all you suckers I'm smoking
I can reach levels from 1 to the 10
You don't believe me? That's on the strength
I do a show, after get respect
And go and pick up my royalty check
Yo when I get it, there ain't no loans
(Why Stezo?) Suckers in the danger zone
Now brace yourself cause I'm about to blast off
Ugly girls, please take the mask off
This is a style that I have learned
Wake up y'all, cause it's my turnSlow down, and yo, let the rhyme flow
And listen to the voice of Stezo
Let me explain the situation that's taught
Blame it on me, yeah, I know it's my fault
For teaching you, how to jam right
Tell you the truth, they need to ban mics
Because, I'm a danger zone
Making beats vibrate right through the bone
Not a doctor, operating
Just a rapper demonstrating
Talents to the people cause they're the facts
Just (Baby break it on down) to the max

	"Baby break it on down"

Let's go, main point, I mean jet out
Rappers, yo, I'm putting heads out
Making MC's drop down to their knees
Saying "More beats please, Stezo-Eaze"
Time after time, this kids getting doper
There's no way (What way?) That you can coper with
The man with the gift
Yo Jim describe me (Swwwwwwift)
It's me Stezo selling records by the rack so
(Baby break it on down) to the max

	"Baby break it on down"

Can you get with this? It's something smooth
Now it's time for Stezo to get in the groove
You've been waiting for a long time, I left you sitting
But now I know a lot of MC's are like shitting
Don't be afraid and alarmed, or just pressured
Keep it on file that Stezo-E is a treasure
I'm dangerous, show-wise I am illegal
Two birds together, I stand out like a seagull
I'm the man, I'm the one, I'm the boss
You call me for a show and I'm a tell you the cost
I'm just a principal, lounging in your high school
So homeboy yo, I just advise you to
Keep it in your skull that I'm phantom fluid
Then you finished the test, then you finally ruined
Remember, this is dope on wax so
(Baby break it on down) To the max

	"Baby break it on down"  (Repeat 2x)

Wham, right in the kisser
There's no way you can diss the
Original rapping king sire
Believe it or not holmes, I'm not a liar
So, let's go, to the show
And see a fly brother with the tempo
Hypen up the crowd just like a coke sniff
Towing MC's away just like a boat lift
Now I'm gone, I'm long, singing a song
Call me the king, without the corn
Listen up, this is a portion of practice
Sticking MC's up just like a cactus
Meaner than ever, never been defeated
Bow down, just like a king I'm being treated
Yo *crack* goes your back so
(Baby break it on down) To the max
