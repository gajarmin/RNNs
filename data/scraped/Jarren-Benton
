[Hook]
You put the codeine in the Sprite
And then you mix it all up
Then you sip it slow
That's how them killas get fucked up
We call it
Lean, Lean
We call it
Lean, Lean (x2)

[Verse 1]
Bada-boom, bada-bing
White cup of lean
Blunt full of green
In the cut as I lean
In a Cutlass Supreme
Fuck with the team
Got her tucked in a jean
I'mma show you what I mean
When I cut a nigga clean, scalpel please
Throw a mu'fucka off the balcony
She don't wanna (gulp) when she give a nigga head
Cause she said that she's tryna watch her calories
It's the weekend
Let your hair down, swallow semen
She just wanna be my girlfriend
Bitch, wake up ho, are you dreamin'?
I got wife and I got children
I don't need you catchin' feelings
What the fuck these bitches sniffing
Cuz you trippin', listen...

Philippine, Billie-Jean, guillotine,Ritalin
Drizzling, Jiggling, Ringaling, Niggaling
Chainsaw blade goes ring-ring
Get a motherfucker for the bling-bling
Bitch I'm on the lean-lean
Girl you on the same thing
Wayne ain't on it no more, let it go, I'mma bring-bring
Chain Flame, get a beat, it's a drink
Gone off of mufuckin' Sprite and Promethazine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lean, on it
'Half Ounce, Quarter Pound', throw it in the bong
Nigga we, on it
You ain't gotta fuck it, you ain't even gotta suck it
Just pull out my dick bitch, breathe on it
I often drift, where was I?
Lean in my cup and I'm feelin' so high
"Dude get the keys to his automobile
And if he can't walk straight then you know he can't drive!"
Lean it, swerve it, please don't let a nigga crash
Shoulda got a cab
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, never woulda been a coulda shoulda
Rip a nigga ass
Throw up in a bag
Eastside, throw it on a map
Cut open a blunt, then I fill it up with hash
If I get the pussy, I'mma put it in a hat
I'mma pull it out her mouth, then I put it in her ass like...

Cocaine, lo mein, propane, Rogaine
Gold chain, no brain, Cobain, Don't mayne
Profane, no shame, slow vein, no vain
No lames, squares and no names
No limit, hit 'em with a tec and a gold tank
Y'all niggas hate cause I'm doin' my own thing
ATLien, finding my own lane
Pop cup full of soda pop and codeine

[Hook][Intro: Hopsin]
All I hear is ladi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dada

[Hook: Hopsin]
Ain't gotta explain myself to no nigga, I don't have to change
Who the fuck I am, dawg, hell nah, that just ain't me
Don't worry 'bout the moves I make, we can really take it there if we have to
All I hear is ladi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dada

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
They calling me the fly guy general, everything is memorable
Marijuana keep me at my pinnacle
Look, lucky me, I got two nougies that's identical
Me stayin' away from all the nicotine and chemicals
Look, I hit my west coast 1-2, cause lyrics do what guns do
Niggas doing what they want to, like this is what it's come to?
Come and witness lives you see me saving
DDT, you break your neck before I break my concentration
Mention the best, motherfuckers better come correct (right!)
Respected on the West, no doubt I'm here to finesse (right!)
Got problems? Hit me direct or get hit with the kill switch
And see, Dizzy go 0 to 100 real quick

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Look, Z to the third, I prefer to observe
Been on the sideline for a minute, now I'm 'bout to emerge
Separated myself from losers tryna take what I earn
Put my faith in this music knowing nothing's easy deserved, I got racks baby
You haven't noticed, I've been working on these tracks lately
Stacking this ammo just in case these niggas act crazy
I got my eyes wide open, putting this plan in motion, plotting how when I'm smoking
Forget about it, your vision's clouded and the truth is shrouded
And bullshit, so, all that gossip, we can do without it
I'm SwizZzleFish, who wants to skinny dip and take a swim?
The water's warm, I promise, darling, take that off and jump on in, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
I'm spitting the illest autobiography, could body your arteries
Name a motherfucker hard as me
I outta be mentioned with the Greek mythology gods
I beat and body the odds, his feet is by the garage
His head inside a duffel bag that's in back of my Dodge
Mr. Benton, ho, I refuse to be pigeonholed, with these imbeciles
A space ace that's been on, bitch, I been gone
I finger these hoes till I get carpal tunnel syndrome
I rap like I don't wanna go back in that basement
Cook up murder material, get blood on my apron
You don't want no problems, what the brass knuckle done
I'm a bully, I don't care to watch these fags guzzle cum
Gat with the bracket that the strap buckle on
Dr. Lecter in this bitch with that black muzzle on
Fuck the industry! Chip on my shoulder, bitch, remember me?
I'm 'bout to murder all my enemies, Hail Mary!

[Verse 4: Hopsin]
Sorry if I come off conceited
I'm dropping killer bars till you niggas all deleted
This lil' microphone, I'm known to eat it
The moment that I succeeded
It was hard to keep the bitches off my penis
Can you believe it?
I been perceived this, a motherfucking omen
Rap Trojan, Hulk Hogan, patrollin'
I ain't here to take no shit from no man
Got a problem with you, I'mma say it, bitch, you know it
I'm Conan, I stroll in
Looking like a monster when I go in
Standing up against me, you got no chance
Tryna play the game without a token, you niggas gotta be joking
This is the reason my niggas the dopest, we on it

[Hook][Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Time is tickin', yeah, it's tickin' away
I waited all my life to say
My misery hates company
I'm at a loss for words, that's a first for me
Silence is golden
Go through the motions
Silence is golden
The same color that my throne is

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, damn, can't believe that my homeboy dead
I still feel shocked like I'm shot in the head
I woke up and cried 'til my eyes turned red
I wish it was a nightmare that I just had
The coroner just put my nigga in a bodybag
And his mama turned away cause she cannot witness that
And I ain't know what to say when I was standin' with your dad
Only thing that I could think was, "Goddamn, this is sad"
Man, we was just laughin' on the weekend
That was your goodbye, guess it just sinked in
No words that I can jot with the ink pen
To describe the way I feel, I guess I'm still grievin'
I wish that I could bring my nigga back
He ain't even know how much he meant to me and that was wack
That I couldn't even express it 'til he layin' on his back
At his fuckin' funeral when I ain't know how to react
Yeah, we supposed to get rich together
God had another plan for you that was better
I send a prayer to your mama and your whole family
Rest in peace, dog, you my homeboy forever
Yeah, I know you livin' in the sky
I wish I had a better way to tell my nigga "Bye"
Make sure you cherish every moment that you spend with your people cause you never know tomorrow they could die
Uh, you believed in me homie, yeah, and for that I thank you
I know you're in a better place, probably up in heaven, crackin' jokes with them angels
Never be forgotten as I'm writin' over violins
I feel alone like I'm on my own island
I think about my nigga every day like I'm at a loss for words as I drown in the silence

[Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Time is tickin', yeah, it's tickin' away
I waited all my life to say
My misery hates company
I'm at a loss for words, that's a first for me
Silence is golden
Go through the motions
Silence is golden
The same color that my throne is

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, damn, there we go, not speakin' again?
Out the front door a nigga leavin' again
I rode around the city pissed off about some bullshit you said
Make me feel like I ain't breathin' again
I get back, and we ain't talked to each other for like two days
Damn girl, who pissed in your Kool Aid?
I apologize a trillion times, make it a trillion-one, but this time I'm too late
Yeah, I guess you fed up with my shit
To get through that cold heart I need an ice pick
The look on your iris, so lifeless, remember them good times we had that was priceless?
Damn, did I fuck you up that bad?
You need space now, I guess I respect that
I'm tryna break through them walls that you put up
But I don't even know where your head at
Yeah, I guess I better let her fly away
It's hard to cope with the pain, I wanna die today
I'll find a fuckin' hideaway to hibernate
I sit and let this liquor wash the hurt like a tidal wave
And oh yeah, by the way
If I could take all the hurt back I'd find a way
I guess I'll pop another pill so I can sleep and let my brains cook
Like I put my head inside a microwave
Yeah, now I feel like a loser
I knew all the wrong I was doin', I would lose her
Now I see the light, amen, hallelujah
But I'm stuck in my shit like I sit in cow manure
World went crashin' when I lost my co-pilot
Ringin' in my head, somebody turn off the sirens
She ain't even talk to a nigga and it hurts so bad
Now all I do is drown in your silence

[Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Time is tickin', yeah, it's tickin' away
I waited all my life to say
My misery hates company
I'm at a loss for words, that's a first for me
Silence is golden
Go through the motions
Silence is golden
The same color that my throne is[Verse 1]
Yea, I’m throwin D’s on the Cadillac
Riding through Decatur nigga, bumping Burt Bacharach
You a fuckin’ liar faggot, never slung a crumb of crack
Bash your fuckin window in
I drag you out your pontiac
Tell your mom the zombie’s back
Fucking hypochondriac
Gag a bitch and shove her in the dryer at the laundry mat
Cokehead insomniac, sipping on some Cognac
Dude this fuckin album sucks I want my fuckin money back
Disadvantage, I’m schizophrenic, these bitches panic
Dickin Janice, I’m poppin Xanax and speaking Spanish
Na la cum la la cum pla, I ain’t say a word
A fuckin’ nerd, I’m riding dirty with the Mossberg
I am awkward, I’m sippin cough syrup
I’m high as a martian in a flying saucer
What up to 808 Blake and Mike Whalberg
I punch through the sheet rock and make the wall hurt
'Teen Wolf', I claw a dress and panties off her
Just got a new Lebaron and the seats is all fur
My brains fried, heart’s gone and my balls hurt
I grab the nine to forty-five and let ‘em all squirt
Mr. Benton, bitches said they sick of him
I’m up at Micky Ds, I get an English McMuffin
You hang around all pigs like you McLovin
I shove a freakin prick inside a fuckin brick oven
You niggas fake like mall cop, Paul Blart
I run you over with the shopping cart in Wal- Mart
Hop out the Subaru, huffing a tube of glue
Your girl ring around my dick just like a hula hoop
Maneuver through the city in a bullet proof suit
I’m strong enough to rip a fucking roof up off a coup
You wanna play 2Pac
I throw you off the roof and run down and catch you
Tell these niggas "Jarren got the juice"
Somebody call the doctor, Dr. Suess or Dr. Ruth
I’m so out of my fucking rocker any fucking doc'll do
I let the choppers loose and then I smoke a rock or two
And spend a hundred grand on a one-legged prostitute

[Hook]
Yea I’m going hard nigga, honey baked
Big say more money, more niggas hate
I blow a couple racks, just took an eighth of coke
Now let me show you what it means to be skitzo

[Verse 2]
Doctor Conrad Murray, Bitch I’m known to kill mics
And meet you in your nightmares, and bash you with a steal pipe
Somebody must have laced this heroin cause I don’t feel right
Just bought my wife a set of Martha Stewart stainless steal knives
Hey, I’m fuckin talking to you dickhead!
Jarren, he's dead he cannot hear you, idiot
Roaming every cities strips and grabbing every pretty tits
Yall niggas playing hookie, mister Benton's really sick
Leave it to Beaver I’m leaving with Beiber with this meat cleaver to his neck
And I’m making him eat ether, kick a bitch in the face cause she’s a dick teaser
Did a song with Satan and that’s a sick feature
I’m not a human being, I’m a sick creature
Run in every church to murder every sick preacher
Stompin niggas to a seizure , smoking every spliff of reefer
A bully throwing geeks off the top bleacher
Fucking skitzo eat the barrel of pistols
I can shit a hand grenade and piss out a missile
Let’s play Operation, I want to see blood drizzle
Let’s make it real official, this saw will cut through a gristle
I’m so extraordinary sleep inside the mortuary
Wake inside the cemetary, dig up every corpse that’s buried
This is so unnecessary, voices in my head, they’re scary
Sick of being crazy, God I want to be ordinary!

[Hook]
Yea I’m going hard nigga, honey baked
Big said more money, more niggas hate
I blow a couple racks, just took an eighth of coke
Now let me show you what it means to be a schitzo

[Jarren Talking]
Yo Jarren, Jarren wake up dog
Come on, yo wake the fuck up man, come on
Come on, Yo Kato, Kato call 911
Man I think this fucker overdosed

[Kato]
Yo Jarren, Jarren
Stop, stop, stop! Chill
Yo, you're just slapping...
You're talking to yourself right now man
I'm trynna study for this midterm...
Fucking Skitzo...[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I eat rappers, save skeleton bones
Welcome to the jungle bitch I ride an elephant home
Get to slapping mother fuckers, get the hell out my throne
Start foaming at the mouth like what the hell am I on
This that DJ Hoppa, Jarren's the new teeny bopper
Face fucking bitches, nice guy wipe the semen off her
Hit the exit bitch, head was my prerequisite
These get to spinning on the Chevy like the exorcist
Lifestyle's reckless, snatch a nigga's necklace
Stunting for my friends like "Watch a nigga check this bitch"
"Hey bitch, you better have my mother fucking money by Thursday"
"I'm sorry mom just go with it, I'm trying to act hard in front of my friends"
Back to murdering wizard shit like Merlin
Stick a javelin through your abdomen fucking nerves of them
Probably didn't occur to them that Jarren's about to murder them
SK will reacquaint you niggas with the earth again
So keep yapping and that gat's squirting
My girlfriend is in the Klan but unaware that she's a black person
Hop on the plane wearing a black turban "I'm a terrorist"
Not a real one idiot, the rap version
A-town's finest, bitches popping out my bathtub like
"The royal penis clean, your heiness"
Moment of silence for my nigga that passed
If I pick this bitch up she gotta fill up my gas
Cut to the chase you fucking if I give you some cash
DJ Hoppa on the beat so niggas know we gonna spaz
Razor blade Benton bitch I wouldn't play with him
And we sharing needles bitch you about to catch AIDS with them

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Crazy thoughts getting lost in my membrane, that's what I get for being outspoken
Observing I can always sense things, speaking how you thinking with your mouth open
It's a party when I'm crashing on the set
So high I'm accidentally ashing on my chest
These MILF bitches keep on asking me for sex
So I tried the shit but I ain't never happy to reflect
Gotta learn to live with regrets
You not giving up the neck, you probably single with a pet
We all know the bitches that be sleeping with a cat
Sneaky bitch got me sneaking out and leaving through the back
If that wasn't an option would you back it up and drop it
Fuck around and trap me in the closet
Stacking like I'm Jerry Stackhouse coming out of college
If you coming out your panties I ain't coming out my wallet
Bitch I'm watching you
Doing that thirsty shit on Twitter gonna be the reason I unfollow you
She say that it's important to me
But good pussy good weed, that's normal to me
You need game I got it bro
Perform to acheive
It was a day contract she been on for weeks
These bitches heating up when they be cold in the streets
Turning bitches out that's older than me

[Verse 3: SwizZz]
See when you show love it gets reciprocated
I see it as flattery when I'm imitated
Invested a couple thou' when I renovated
Turned my bedroom into a studio and orchestrated
My plan to make a living off this rap shit
To pay back more than a fraction
Of what I owe to everyone that help me see it through or make it happen
Won't be long before we cash in, living outward I imagine
Exactly how I planned it
A couple handouts but I tripled what I was handed
It gets quite easy distinguishing who was candid
Some homies lost faith and sooner or later vanished
Damnit, Fuck it, I ain't tripping over spilled milk
So fuck it, when times are hard I'm willing to help
I better myself so I can better everyone else
Around me, San Fernando, Los Angeles County
Just thought I'd mention the home base
Disrespectful niggas get stomped like home plate
Still taking jack shots, ramu, no chase
8 shot in and still ok, it don't stop
Pour another till I'm feeling woozy
Even the bitches acting bougie
Uncapable of starring in they home movie
With a few scenes, a couple in the bed, then backyard jacuzzi
Making additions to two Zs
And we're straight like the face your girl gave
When she lied about being laid
DJ Hoppa let the record spin and rotate
F-U-N-K Volume biatch!

[Verse 4: Hopsin]
This is what I'm giving you, funky shit to listen to
Came up in the underground and now you trying to mimic who?
Ain't familiar with this flavor, homie I'll reintroduce
Taking it back to when S-N-Double O-P had dropped that gin and juice
Give me a minute to
Fuck up your mental with a pencil over this instrumental that’s how a menace do
I'm launching missles, it's simple to cripple
I got a bite like a pitbull, that's why they love me and they ain't feeling you
My life is a tightrope that I walk carefully
So many bitches on my dick I need therapy
My girl walking out I'm trying to grab her screaming "[Sarah] please
You said you loved me I thought you would be there for me"
I lift the bullshit then Hopsin makes the parodies
My man's so famous he could hook me up with a pair of jeans
And a gangster rap shirt with a snapback
It makes my past easier to laugh at
If you a hater then you need to get your ass slapped
You don't wanna see me cross your path like a black cat
I'm everything that your ass lacked
FV nigga and that's that
I call names, if you respond that's a fat trap
Remember me the ugly fucking nigga with the mad rap
A sinister's what I've been known to be
And you know I'm about to kill this shit with Hoppa on the beat[Produced by M16]

[Intro]
Oh my fucking god
Oh my fucking god DANIEL
Turn the fucking nigger music off
TURN IT OFF

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, I'm an Apex predator, I murder my competitors
I stick a Wu-Tang sword inside of ya retina
Pre-leaded yeah I guzzle regular unleaded gas
Strike a match, spit fire, mu'fucka burn in hell with us
Inhaling dust, I rip off an elephant's tusk
Irrelevant fucks, you want a war against us
We just tore this bitch up
Get the coroner I slaughter ya
My dick don’t discriminate, I pork a big slut
We've created a monster!
The son of Lucifer come to ruin ya, put the Ruger
To ya thermonuclear get that new career
Take your fucking head as a souvenir
Wake up in the morning; what the fuck am I doing here?
I'm the shit in the booth, take a poop in here
Aluminum bat now got his fucking Lumineers
Fuck brakes we don't stop keep moving here
Fuck swag, yeah bitch my whole crew is weird
Yeah, you couldn't fathom my pain
I hated being me, I was mad at my brain
All the hurt that I felt, made me sad and insane
Look back like God I was glad I felt strange
Fuck trying to change for you faggot ass lames
Or you fucks who wouldn't let me get a stab at this game
Now it's FV bitch and I'm back for revenge
'Bout to make you mu'fuckas feel the wrath of my pain

[Hook]
I can't eat, I can't sleep
Why should I give a fuck about what you believe?
If I don't eat, then I don't breathe
They gon' let me in this bitch
God damn I'm about to
Go off (3x)
Until they let me in this bitch
Go off (3x)
And they gon' let me in this bitch

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Yo bitch in a dress, I'm about to make a mess
Cutthroat, throw up fuckin' snap like a neck
I pull your card out, and stick it back in the deck
Bought a ticket to your show to throw trash at your set
Get bapped with a left if you step like a -- frat dude
Tell me why your older sister has a -- tattoo
Of a zodiac, stamped on her lower back
Perhaps she swallows cum and sucks cock like a VACUUM!
Right? Right, I hit it on the mark
Cuban, I’m going off like a broken car alarm
Feta, Gouda, Cheddar, Provolone, Parmesan
'Til we after that cheese no pizza; Papa John
Like Hakeem Olajuwon we gon' rap it up the ladder
'Til we posted like a status bringing hell to all you faggots
And pussy niggas thinkin' braggin' enjoy the fuckin' baddest
Compete in the pageant and I’ll move to Cali and start acting
Made a mistake and had to find myself
Remind myself, fame ain't wealth
Pain don't last, learn to adapt and it's hard to fail
I can give a fuck 'bout no one else
Loyal to the fam and the team we built
Still I rise, what up 'Pac
If I fall, be a very long drop, yep

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Hey Mr. Benton I came here to rip shit
Got the whole neighborhood waitin' to get this
Niggas better run, it ain't safe in the trenches
It's going down like I'm paying Satan a visit
Wack ass swag niggas, they get suspended
Don't play with the wicked, my hate is intended
I’m in the bathroom, gettin' brain from a midget
She got a fat booty but her face is horrendous!
Yeah, you rap but we the realest who have done it
If you want us on a track, then we killin' you up on it
Like we took a fucking javelin and ran it through your stomach
This is Swizzle, Benton and Hop, we figured you would want it
Dizzy in the clouds, too high to rap now
FV turn it up I like the track loud
You gettin' out of line, we provide the smack-down
I’m so motherfuckin' hyped I could pass out, WOAH
I remember when I was the nigga chillin' in the background
Considered a wack clown, gettin' turned down for deals
Livin' up in my mom's crib with a sad frown
There was days were I wanted to give up and just crumble
But I didn't do it, I just stuck to my hustle
I learned if you want to turn heads in the world
Then you can't give a fuck, go nuts 'til they love you!

[Hook]

Until they let me in this bitch
And they gon' let me in this bitch[Produced by Don Cannon]

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
It’s Jon Connor, the people’s rapper
Uh, look, ey, start with a dream, young and naïve and then they grow the ambition
Fucked up conditions, put my mom’s in a better position
See I’m the future like a psychic prediction
I’m from the school of hard knocks, shit I did life in detention
I’m from where niggas get shot down, dreams get shot down
Wish the hood would let us live but all we heard was “block out”
Now I’m further than what they believed I’d achieve
‘Cause Flint niggas don’t even want you to have dreams when you sleep
Low expectations, no expectations, know what you facing
Fuck the odds I proved you can get up from under a basement
I been with scandalous bitches that will take you for granted
Roll with scandalous niggas only taking advantage
People take your kindness for weakness, taking you through the ringer
It’s a gang bang, life is a bitch and it’s not a pre-nup
Life is dirty, shit box dirty, and we’re playing clean-up
Go through the Ike & Tina, before the Martin & Gina
I play follow the leader and I done swam with the sharks made it out the Aquafina
Niggas turned into leeches, turned these swamps into beaches
My people saying "Eureka!", niggas pretend, they hate you, they despise you, they ain’t you
Niggas is full of shit that’s why they probably empty
God promised a feast how you gon’ tempt me with Denny's
Niggas and bitches rats, stay away from mickey's and minnie’s
I fend for this city, when I ain’t have a friend in this city
Adding in your two cents? I’ll show you what to do with them pennies, look
My intellect been a wreck, crash course on this real shit
In Flint, every day is a Virginia Tech, fuck rating on the internet
Fuck what popping off in comments, pop off in public
My niggas is into that, Jon Connor AVM, Aftermath, best in the world nigga!

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Uh, Jarren Benton, half-man, half-tyrannosaurus
I wasn’t born I was thrown out a spaceship in Atlanta in an abandoned forest
The Grizzly bear trapped Goldilocks in a pan of porridge
I call my name and you’re fuckin’ scared you can’t ignore us
Go get a damn thesaurus, the preacher, the son of God
Only way you fuckin’ with Mister Benton, no façade
I put a man in the desert sand, that’s no mirage
I go gambit on niggas and pull your poker cards
I go loco mark open heart surgery, with no power tools
A fuckin’ monster, I will devour you
I’m Cujo and cocaine with rabies in them
These kids dying like Casey Anthony babysitting
I’ll fuckin’ fuckin’ rip  your tonsils out
And throw your dead corpse in a tool shed in my uncle’s house
I got love for Lil' Boosie but free Mumia
These niggas signing like three-sixty deals for two New Kias
Shit, TLC got a Rav-4
You might catch me in a Prius with a bad whore
I snatch a rapper out the sunroof of a Jaguar
You ain’t a spitter, then what the fuck do you rap for?
Niggas like “I ain’t a rapper, I’m a trapper”
Then stay inside the trap or get eaten by the fuckin’ master
Of ceremonies, it's hip hop, with a gold rope and a pair of ponies
Can't grab a bitch by the ponytail ‘cause the hair is phony
Moving from African Gods to Amistad
These niggas going broke is still stunt in they momma’s car
It’s FV twenty-one-four the summer’s ours
And you a bitch in a woman’s skirt, son of a coward
The fireman, I extinguish these niggas out fast
I grew up off of Red, Em, Goodie Mob, and Outkast
I keep the Wu-Tang sword propped on the front seat
That’s your favorite rapper? To me that nigga just lunch meat
Jarren Benton, Rest in Peace Jahmal Pryor

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
Uh, Let me talk my shit
Bands in my pocket so I walk like this
Just spent 80 grand when I bought my whip
Lou told me to lease it but I bought my shit
And I came in the game like LeBron James
First the money, and the fame, then the broads came
See your clique, fifty deep, but they all lame
Young nigga stacking books like a card game
They like “How the fuck is he a freshman?”
Young nigga spitting better than the veterans
I need the cover, why the fuck I gotta sit with them?
The whole world know these words ain't compared to him
Uh, yeah the kid’s so cocky, feeling like Ali
Niggas can’t stop me, jackers wanna rob me
Opps wanna pop me, that's why I keep a lil’ bro right beside me
I’m from the Chi, shit real in this motherfucker
Fuck around, get killed in this motherfucker
Paranoid, I can’t chill in this motherfucker
Can’t leave without the steel in this motherfucker
These niggas keep saying “Don’t trip”
Climbing to the top, I just hope I don’t slip
Niggas sending threats and I never been a bitch
So I’m steady buying guns, youngin feeling like tilt
Lil’ Bibby I’m the same old pimp
No more Ramen Noodles, just lobsters and shrimp
I could be in jail tryna talk through them vents
Or running from the cops, probably hopping a fence
But, I’m in the drop with the tints
Flow so sick it don’t make no sense
Niggas be mad I don’t take no pics
Chain so froze I could take your bitch
But I don’t even need ice though
And this that eighty-four mic flow
We don’t rap beef, my squad a little psycho
Plus these rap niggas suck like Lipo
I ain’t forgot about the old me
Straight off the block now I’m ballin’ like Kobe

[Verse 4: Troy Ave]
Troy Ave, with the classic feel
Bands be racking, major without a deal
I’m that nigga, if you got eyes you could tell
You’re seeing me rise, you're seeing me with XX-L
Putting on for my city and I’m doing it well
So much style I should be down with The Stylistics as well
This like BIG and Jay, Troy Ave hit after
I represent the streets, I ain’t these weirdo rapper
Self-paid nigga came from whipping the batter
Hit the bank they like “Who is this young stacker?”
HP, PSB, HE, double-L yes, oh baby, yeah, it’s me
Ho spillers, smooth skinner, dope dealer
Mad niggas be out in New York, my buzz iller
I’m an ill nigga, Dungarees by Hilfiger
As a lil’ nigga coming up, now I’m bigger
In the dope game, then these fraud niggas with rap names
I’m named after my block, Troy Ave mane
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, still in this street thang
We’ll be at the Barclays, Nets vs. Heat game
Man, where these other niggas seats man?
Man, these seats ain’t cheap, man
These other niggas weak, man
Talking ‘bout they proud of me
Pay attention to my moves but I style for free
These bum nigga styles ain’t no style to me
Dickriding never been transportation, B
Powder, Troy Ave biz, we reckless
New York City shit, uh huh[Hook: Pounds]x2
1 for the money
2 for the bass
3 for them boys with the (whoo) on they waist
1 for the money, 1, 1 for the money
2 for the, 2, 2 for the bass

[Verse 1: Pounds]
Look
P the commissioner
Best since Christopher
Put it on your head like conditioner
You should hit the minister
I'm-a put the ?
Get sick of a bitch
Twister her
Like 26 kick flips to the face
Grand finale shit, 100 quick clips with a chase
I'm the reason for cheese, please be the cash cow
?
Higher than some 3 dollar seats in the bleachers
I'm a beast so I sleep with the creatures
Rap about them highs and the blow, I don't care man
I put you in the sky for the low, like air train
Hop up in the booth and go Anthony Hopkins
I don't give a shit with your family watchin'
It's all hip-hop, the blood trickle
Oh my ?

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Allergic to fake shit
D's on the spaceship
God's favorite son, yet I'm caught up in the Matrix
Dr. Benton here to give the game a face lift
I'm off of the chain like I escaped from a slave ship
I...don't...like
99.9 percent of y'all faggots on the mic
Fuck what you heard
If you ain't the Neptune then more than likely I ain't fucking with you nerds
I'm gone off the syrup
And I am not referrin' to Aunt Jemima nor Mrs. Butterworth
I got a white bitch I call Lindsay Nohan
Cause when she sucks dick the bitch uses no hands
Oh man!
What a feelin'
I'm high as an alien and dancing on the ceilin'
I'm gonna make a billion...
Dollars, so when I'm in the dirt I can have something to leave to my children
Cowabunga dude
Whores, they adore me, but bitch you only love me because of my cool
"What you up to?"
No good
I'm straight from Decatur but I'm not so hood
I'm more-so psycho
More like Michael...
Myers, Jarren Benton bitch, I'm on fire
Sucka ass niggas, she call me sire
And I won't stop rocking until I retire[Intro/Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Ok fellas this is it
We got together to play our kind of music and so far nobody's let us
Well we're going to play it tonight whether they like it or not
We're going to do all our good numbers tonight, every single one of them
We'll start with 1 O'Clock Jump

[Hook]
Ballin'
Talk is cheap, the bodies start to fall in
Rumors rappers are leanin on the wall again
Going all in, watch me put the pause in
What your man got, dawgs out there banging like Bangkok
Smoke clears we leaving off the main lot
Time's up, when the bass drop

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
You don’t hear me though
See your little bitter comments on the videos
Your peers and your ears bumping my material
See me, yo I’m the shit just in general, what [?]
They’d shoot me, I’m made you look
Never lying, landmine in my ramble
Crunch time on the grind got the line hooked
Fat dime think I’m lying got them all shook
You ain’t all that, 150 shows a year what you call that
Couple bad bitches groping on my ballsack
Fuck a fiend that could, pussy sipping cognac, haters fall back
1 O’Clock I’m getting the dope spot
The person with the pack raising the cap to smoke guap
Fiends is steady coming, the money it won’t stop

[Bridge]
We got together to play our kind of music and so far nobody's let us
Well we're going to play it tonight whether they like it or not
We're going to do all our good numbers tonight, every single one of them
We'll start with 1 O'Clock Jump

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
ATLien extraterrestrial
I'm in this bitch like I don't give a fuck, I've got an extra pair of testicles
I fuck your bitch then fall asleep on the couch with my draws and the tv on
That afternoon I killed you first, then cut up the corpse with Stevie Stone
Life in the jungle wasn't shit that my mama could teach
Should've used a coat hangar to kill me when I was a fetus
Go eat a Snickers cause you rappers just bitches and beavers
Fucking cupcakes, faggots with feminine features
I never trust women and reachers
I'm not a human being, I'm a different creature
I love ratchet bitches, belligerent skeezers
After I beat the pussy up then we getting some pizza
I'm pimpin' bitches with telekinesis
After your mom give me a blumpkin I'm nailing your nieces
Fuck your thoughts, to hell with your thesis
After we take the organs out then we mail them to Jesus

[Bridge]

[Hook]x2

We're going to do all our good numbers tonight, every single one of them
We'll start with 1 O'Clock Jump[Hook]
30000 feet, 30000 feet, 30000 feet

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
30000 feet, bitch I’m up in NASA
I’ve got prostitutes and cocaine, it’s a party in mi casa
She just wanna dance so she gives me head to Kesha
Do the dougie on my dick and when she finish I don’t kiss her
Ridin’ down the street with your baby sister
All white everything, I call that shit Hitler
Hoes say I’m jewish cause I do not tip the strippers
Even though I probably stiff her, I still take her home and stick her
Hello bitches, Jarren’s home, now what the fuck is dinner
Teenage Mutant Niggas, we don’t fuck with Master Splinters
And blame it on rats, bitch I got rest
And if that pussy gives applause, that mean that bitch has got claps
Ridin’ in a Lac, sippin’ on some yack
Gettin’ fucked by Lisa Turtle, told that bitch to call me Zack
Kato on the track, and yeah this beat’s a maniac
Bitch act like you on quantum leap and bring that ass back
I don’t fuck with AFLAC, bitch you know it’s Geiko
My nigga Elz Jenkins movin’ weight just like it’s lipo
Don’t us make pop the trunk, we got them sawed off rifles
Bitch I’m 30000 feet but don’t fuck with me cause I’m psycho

[Hook]
30000 feet, 30000 feet, 30000 feet
I said y’all niggas underneath
Bitch I am 30000 feet, 30000 feet, 30000 feet
I said y’all niggas underneath
Bitch I am...
We be in the stars at the Mars with the Martians
We be in the stars at the Mars with the Martians
30000 feet, 30000 feet, 30000 feet
I said y’all niggas underneath
Bitch I am 30000 feet

[Verse 2: Elz Jenkins]
We like the best in east Atlanta
Niggas talkin’ otherwise, then move ‘em to Savannah
Pinky ring looks like I can summon Captain Planet green
Diamonds and the other one like the Green Lantern
Drug dealer psycho, come with all that fake shit
Put you in your place like a real estate agent
Rock it cliff fool
And I’m quick to spare mine
Push your wig back, Flo Rida’s hair line
My side bitch be hatin’ on my main bitch
I don’t get it cause these bitches suck the same dick
Promoters put me up, I bring ‘em out nigga
And I don’t gotta wear a chain like a house nigga
Cook the weed and cook the yay’
Smellin’ like I cooked today
All I see is hard white, like a fuckin’ X-Ray
30000 feet, I can tell the jets hate
Snuck it trough the airport
I’ma sell the jet yay’
You broke hoes barely get you cup fill
So fly they swear my closet down at Hartsfield
Lookin’ for you bitch, knees is by my feet
Jarren brought the pills, now I’m 30000 feet

[Hook]
30000 feet, 30000 feet, 30000 feet
I said y’all niggas underneath
Bitch I am 30000 feet, 30000 feet, 30000 feet
I said y’all niggas underneath
Bitch I am...
We be in the stars at the Mars with the Martians
We be in the stars at the Mars with the Martians
30000 feet, 30000 feet, 30000 feet
I said y’all niggas underneath
Bitch I am...[Produced By: Kato]

[Intro]
K-K-Kato on the track, bitch

[Verse 1]
I prayed for my enemies, I told the lord to bless the both of us
Papa threw the deuces, but fuck it, I never hold grudges
My worst fear is to die broke
Life in the jungle would rip the horns off a rhino
Music always been a part of us, mama was never hard on us
I was always worried when she had to ride the MARTA bus
Started drinking young, cause them Koreans never carded us
Young and black, but they didn't give a fuck and it was obvious
Lifestyle of a dope boy is simply captivating
To niggas turning Master Splinter on the affidavit
I'm jewish with the bread, every dollar's calculated
These niggas sideways, this nine'll get them calibrated
I'm just a dreamer asking God to shine a little light
These niggas soft and they'll probably die in a pillow fight
I'm smoking hashish out of a silver pipe
I told that bitch to run the jewels, word to Killer Mike
Promethazine and Sprite on ice, when I ain't feeling right
I ain't concerned about vices, bitch, I'm just living life
These hoes gon' let us cut, just like a kitchen knife
I'm on that kryptonite, I break them when I flip the dykes
I eat beats and then I spit the bone, a pistol's chrome
Catch me in the old school, bumping Vic Damone
Mister Benton home, niggas get to falling back
Cash rules everything and nigga, I want alladat

[Hook]
Fuck the world, bitch, I want alladat
Cash rules, nigga, gimme alladat
I ain't playing, I want alladat
Kicking down your door, bitch, gimme alladat
I want alladat, nigga, gimme alladat
I want alladat, nigga, gimme alladat
I want alladat, nigga, gimme alladat
I want alladat, nigga, gimme alladat

[Verse 2]
Name a nigga in my city that can fuck with me
Besides the OG's, y'all pussy niggas is weak
Nightmare On Elm Street, put these niggas to sleep
Old frog ass nigga, I dare you faggots to leap
Lame ass niggas can't walk in these pair of shoes
Jump out airplanes and shoot at coupes, while I parachute
High as a paratroop, old school like a pair of Troops
Rappers wear a suit, cause this bully gon' bury you
I'll disable y'all, niggas agitated like the cable off
Southern niggas spilling hot sauce on the tablecloth
Think the god's soft, then this K about to break them all
Pussy ass niggas getting jealous cause we taking off
Imma feast, got your bitch cooking quiche
Hundred grand at my nigga's grave, may he rest in peace
Kick game like a priest, I told you, I'm sucker free
Politic with rich Jews, while spilling wine on a fleece
Toast to tomorrow I'm sipping wine on a beach
I rhyme like a beast, the nine inside the Caprice
Garbage ass nigga, your fucking lines is weak
And you can lose life if you fuck with mine, capiche?
I've been this way, show you how the switch blade, penetrate
I fuck hoes, that look like Gabourey Sidibe
I stuff bricks in a pillow case and hit your face
These narcotics got me feeling, like I sit in space
Cash rules everything around me
Money over bitches, told these lame ass hoes to get around me
Eastide killer, I came from DeKalb county
A-Town's royal, you motherfuckers should crown me

[Hook][Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Earth to Mr. Benton
Man these pills got me feeling like the Earth is missin’
And you so pussy you can birth an infant
And I’m here to spoon feed you fuckers something different
Zone 6 lunatics we will bury you
I’m so fuckin’ high I need a spacesuit and parachutes
Supermarket knife attack
Put a hit out on the booth, now show me where the mic is at
Battlestar Galactica
These niggas ain’t real they’re like Avatars and Dracula
Haters wanna shoot me out the sky like Galaga
Soaring out the Earth with your bitch in the passanger
These niggas ain’t read homes
They are on romanic get aways with Bishop Eddie Long
Welcome to the Terradome
And I am no neurologist but your bitch gives me hella dome

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
And I am feelin’ so fuckin’ rad
Totally awsome dude, the best feelin’ I’ve had
I bet they wonder what we smoke
They wanna travel where we go
But you should know we don’t need no woose
Propose a toast cause we’re on top now
I’m up in Mars with the top down
They wanna travel where we go
Put that flame up to that killer, let it smoke
We don’t need no woose

[Verse 2: Aleon Craft]
Mothership Decatur blasting off-off
To another galaxy with a pretty ass Martian break her off-off
It licks her soft, inside her jaw
Travelling through wormholes folding space to a brand new world
Then it’s back to the Earth, Cadillac no skirt with paint like a brand new curl
Yeah, that thang tripping, energy’s constant, no beginning
Bitch I’m a monster, mic’s on ripping
My shit be bumping, eardrum bleeding
Kush platform, no babysitting
I transform, supreme new being
I go hard, I can pitch nine innings
C.C. Sabathia
You don’t really want me after ya
East ATLiens kinda throwed off
We settle like traffickers
Soundwaves and decibels
Hack in the brainwaves, tappin’ the mainframe
Girls go crazy, make ‘em wanna hit that flow, drop low and back it up
Haters just pack it up
Pinch my cheek I’m mess it up
Too far gone, I’m an astronaut
You’re not doper than presrciption durgs
Alien crafts, spittin’ sky rap
Solar system fly, Google sky map

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Same shit different day, the planet still orbitin’
Marty so fly I’m pullin’ hoes in my DeLorean
Where we’re goin’ we don’t need woose
Just a gas mask, oxygene and some weed smoke
So fresh, so clean, I’m an Outkast
Eastside, ain’t hit a nigga, doubt that
When I pull up in the Chevy with the bass beatin’ heavy
Tell me what you motherfuckers know about that
Yeah, Jarren John Rambo
Suicide bomber suck a nigga, yeah I plan to blow
Cram a dick down your nana’s throat
Bitch if you sick then I’m the motherfuckin’ antidote
Bullshit walks and money flies
The industry is a bunch of fuckin’ robots like Johnny Five
Honey hi, I’m home, and they wonder what I am on
And I’ve got so high I’m blown
And they wonder where I have gone
Right here in the twilight zone
My spaceship flies up long
Here all I need just two turn tables and one microphone

[Hook][Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I done risked my life for this so fuck some
Lame ass fuck nigga saying he ain't feeling me
That shit just made me stronger
So keep on shooting bitch you ain't killing me
I still wake up worried like fuck it
Any minute everything could come down crashing
And it's back to them bullshit 9 to 5s
And them niggas behind your back laughing
Like, where the fuck did I go wrong
Fight suicide thoughts like hold on
I don't ever wanna go back when I felt insecure
And so low y'all, I went so strong
Too much pain I need an oxicodone
Left for dead in the cold, no coat on
Brain was so gone, that was so long
Couldn't get a break no Turbo Ozone
Same old slow song we all dance to
Some die young, didn't get a chance to
Live their dreams, just a bullet from a 9 millimeter
Going in your head like shampoo
Get going, still fight the same phobia
Don't let this fear paralyze and keep holding you
One day you wake up today through shit
Tomorrow these unloyal fucks will get over ya
Live great for my kid's sake
Spit pain over mixtapes
And you find out who your real friend
Cause when shit gets tough and them niggas turn away then that shit's fake
Last year I had to shed a few tears
Lost a good friend, had to pour a few beers
Why when everything goes right
Niggas find a way to fuck it up, still waking up with new fears

[Hook: Hemi]
And everytime you hear me I'm trying just to wind the clock back and keep my 15 minutes of fame
Knowing every second that the clock ticks a million other people trying to take my spot and get in the game
This is all I've ever wanted and it's all I know so I gotta hold on
I gotta do it for my family, I can't let them down, I'm so afraid to fail, but they think I'm so strong
But I got Atychiphobia
I ain't come this far to fall
I got Atychophobia
No I ain't come this far to fall
I got Atychophobia
The world's all watching, the world's all waiting
And I don't know why I'm so afraid
But I got Atychophobia

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Break down when the clock stops
Hot on the downhill movement
What the mother fuck have I been doin'
Everybody got their own illusion
Stop watch as my life fades
Hopscotch and run tirades
Till the lock pops and I fly straight
I'mma stock shots and run sideways
I'm made in the ice age
Don't cross blades on an off day
Cause I rock stages, not cosplay
These fake fucks are off Broadway
Stock shades on my face of course
Time melts into the base and morphs
To the great divorce and I pray for more
That's just a countdown faster than [?]

[Verse 3: Bernz]
Why these bitches standing in line for their new phones
I’m scheming, and plotting, and working my options, and burning my new wrongs
Repping the fam and cooking the ham we hotter than two suns
They know who I am but the fans that'll have me on record broke out of the group homes
With some new [?] in Miami the Cadillac's two toned
No time to be wasting, my homies are famous
We never look back, we make new songs
The music is strange and the singers are dangerous
I'll never grow old and the clock will be painted
I'm feeling immortal and popping like Orville
We all got a phobia, gotta disorder that wastes us

[Hook][Verse 1: Nino Bless]
The government lies
And the hood stay blind
Every south-side in a city is a ghetto
And a dollar's only printed into debt so from the womb you already owe the devil
Wait thats too complicated? Okay, eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Teenie-weenie minds think they're fresh cause they are buying clothes
Polo, oh shit! I ain't mean to go there like when Romo throws a pick
I go solo, like jackin' some homeless folks I am so in a coma, Ebola sick
No, your cancer cells love Coca-Cola soda
Hold up, man shut the fuck up with this bullshit (Sorry, try again)
Versace, Versace, before I couldn't sneak in the cracks were too tiny
But since I've been rhyming so godly they done dilated like an iris on Miley, Cyrus on Mollys
I just embody, Tyson's prime with a karate, black belt
These raps is felt and hit ya chest like having some sake with fish & wassabi at a hibachi
I am captain insomniac, fact, never sleep no
So its by default, Nino's alarm's on beastmode, co-co-copy (whoa)
And in the name of Heaven, I am chasing this wealth
I could escape from the gates of Hell but can not escape from myself
Christ was a carpenter, Nino is a harbinger of the evolved
Got your attention like a swastika stickered yamaka by the bar at a bar mitzvha, fuck ya'll I'm iller
Raw beats through my yamahas stoke this hard spitter, got me all lit up
And this flame got some in awe and probably made Dilla turn to God, like THATS God...Zilla, dog
I am still all that and a bag of the baddest piff mixed with acid hits
Got a bitch so bad she ain't never been on Santa's list, she's only not sucking dick when I have to piss, (I wish)
My wifey won't ever be fond of that rhyme
Thats just a line unless we break up mañana then maybe that line was a sign
(Fuck you Nino!) Just said that so I can do a song with her
2 bisexual girls as roomies, that's word to the ghost of John Ritter
Check the thermometer,somebody temperature's high blame Jarren, I'm hammin
I'm bout to go into his grandma's basement take that gun from her lap and start blammin'
(Blat blat blat blat)

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
I'm throwin' Ds on that Delorean
This weed that I'm chiefing on came from Oregon
I need it man so I hop inside the El Camino, then I crash that bitch inside the fucking drug emporium
Fuck you and your metropolis, I'll put the gun in your esophagus
Y'all lames ain't real, these fuck niggas fake acting like they move rocks like a fucking archaeologist
Nigga please, I'm a disease, go get a priest, ain't a fucking human being baby I'm a beast
I'm bout to put a hole in your capris, I told you hoes I'm cheap I'll take a bitch out for a milk shake like Kelis, capicse?
I'm laying on the beach with a bitch, she 'bout to suck the dick til I'm sleep
I wake up, hit the pussy to some Keith Sweat
I'll introduce you rappers to your maker like hello, have you met yet?
I wake with the TEC by the headrest
I'll punch a nigga then I take his necklace
Hoes say that Jarren you a dog, when they throw the pussy at me they be like nigga catch, fetch
Bitch bring it back like the Fresh Fest
I'll put you on the top of that guest list
Mr. Benton coming for you rappers when I catch you motherfuckers I'm-a leave a nigga head-less
God throwing ice to nicest on this mic devices, I'm high trying to fight these vices
Head in the vice grip, I'll leave you lifeless
I ain't got it all someone off my light switch
I eat a rapper's brain and wash it down with Pellegrino, in the Philippines smoking dope with Filipinos
I do a drive-by in an old Grand Tarino, throw a hand grenade out the window with my nigga Nino[Chorus: Geek]
I see an angel
Walking beside me
Asking me if I would like to come home
Would like to come home (4X)

[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
Have you ever heard the sound of 100 Choppas
Bussin at you from every angle
Make your body freeze like a statue
Hack you
And then Kurt Angle
Slam you like pissed off police
That’s what happens when you put IDK on the beat
This is a brief warning, bitch don’t push me
If there’s a fight I start
You a 12th round rookie
I’m the kid who faked bomb threats to play hookie
You the type that’s born hermaphrodite and keep the pussy
Pussy
I’ll fuck up your whole life
Soon as you find out that I’m fucking your whore wife
I walk inside the room, tell your daughter to hold tight
And if the hole tight
I still give her the whole pipe
That was my other side talking, He sort of lost it
Because the side that he’s trying to follow’s inclosed by caution tape
He’s dead, He’s dead
I have no head
My frontal lobe is hanging from a noose of thread

[Chorus: Geek]
I see an angel
Walking beside me
Asking me if I would like to come home
Would like to come home (4X)

[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
I hate positive beings that try to make thing seem
Like everything’s okay
When the reality stings
Like 40 rounds from a K
Shut up your face before I cut off your head and use your brains as a display
I like eating ice cream
The thought of
???
Excites me
The thought of killing innocent tourists and leaving their bodies in a forest to rigamortis right before I sightsee
Makes me content
Its the way that I vent
One time I torched my landlord for asking for rent
I had a bad day
He came at the wrong time
Approximately a minute after Satan called my landline

[Skit]

[Chorus: Geek]
I see an angel
Walking beside me
Asking me if I would like to come home
Would like to come home (4X)

[Verse 3: Ryan Lee]
Dear insanity
Who’s the man in the vanity
Ego big as a manatee
Manically eating anchovies
In the midst of calamity niggas panicking
He’s as cool as the pillow he suffocated your family with
He’s frantically trying to better humanity
He loves fuckin so fuck it he’s profanity
And no scantily clad women
He had been in
Still suppressing memories from when they dads went in
And he’s gross like flatulence
If niggas think they gassed up let the match commence
Until he opens up the hatch
Get the rachet
And like a pool shark, he’s walking out without a scratch - he wins
He’s been insane
His personalities clash
He feels like he martin pain
He looking in the mirror
I think he’s looking at me
Apparently he makes his appearances in a beat
Sincerely
Ryan Lee

[Skit]

[Verse 4: Jarren Benton]
Reverse the fucking Coupe
Then I shoot at you through the sunroof
I cut back on my drinking
One line of coke and just one brew
Show you the art of war with a oyster knife
This ain’t Sun Tzu
Tell ya momma to come through
We can kick it like kung-fu
Come on bitch you tripping
Really I promise I’m not that deranged
These rappers are lames
Okay I’m reloaded
This Gensu
Will make you drop out of your brain
Fuck ya Maybach
Bitch i got a propeller plane
On top of my Honda Accord
I hover through earth
I have one hell of a day
The kick on this AK is crazy
BBBBRRRRRAAAAAAATTT
Damn
One hell of a spray
I’m Tony Montana and Hellen Leshae
Put 2 in ya face, put you in a grave
A bad mix of narcotics has got my bitch pukin’
I like white sluts that suck dick for fig newton
My music influencing heroin usage
And if you dumb enough to do it fucker you’re stupid
Its like the mind of leatherface meets George Lucas
Kidnap Ke$ha then I beat it till the whore stupid

[Verse 5: Jay IDK]
I’m the type to tell a bitch to suck my dick inside a church
And if she ask me why, I lie, and say its in a bible verse
I’m the worst
I think I'll probably carjack a hearse
Run up to a senior citizen and jack her fucking purse
Pursuing a rap career wasn’t in my plans, ho
Plans, ho
I would have been just fine
Running round trying to slash thoughts asshole
I think I need a shot just to kill the pain
Fuck a shot I need an automatic block to my brain

Bitch I’m a drinker and driver
Conniving thief and a liar
Aspiring pervert conspiring a way to spy on Mariah
When she comes out her attire
I’ll beat my dick till its tired
And when she turn around I’ll jump up off the tree that I’m hiding in
After that never rap again
Thats the reason I came in this rap career
To get a physical look of Mariah's rear
Messiah is here
You tired of fear?
Drink a bottle of tylenol till you start to feel
Ahhhh
Tired, you hear?
ByeBig Rube

I have thoughts within thoughts
Conscience inceptions perceived through the conceptions of fights I've been for
The battle of freedom raged as I waged against the tyrannical mechanics of the architects of my enslavery
Not just body and mind, but economic status
So I dreamed of this apparatus to immortalize my determination and petrify my anger
Convey the emotions of a nation, terrorized from constant danger
Not a hero but a truth sayer, not a politician, a preacher, magician or soothsayer
Merely a dreamer with the muse of rhythmic inscription
A talent that many perceive is said to be a gimmick of encryption
A seamless spring of seemingly meaningless strings of useless info
For those that crave nothing more than the tales of abuse to some nympho
Or perhaps, the epic saga of the million dollar necklace
How you ride huge rims, make cocaine swim and then end up in jail for being reckless
Rarely, can I respect the oblivious nature of ignorant fables
I will not sell my soul or lose control, reel up with my folk and still put food on my tableHook: [Jarren Benton]
Woke up and I feel just like a billion (bucks) x3
They gone hate, but we don't give a billion (fucks) x3
I'm in VIP I'm with a billion (sluts) x3
Everyday I feel just like a billion (bucks) x3

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Uno, dos, tres, leggo
Y'all sucka ass niggas soft like Jell-O
Pull up in the Trans-Am, nose on the whole gram
Of the white girl nigga, Jay Othello
Kick a nigga door for the k-i-l-o
Blunt full of kush make a nigga feel mellow
Sayonara to the bad guy to the .45 in the SK muthafucka say hello
Hello, hi, me I'm high, mesmerized by neon lights
Bitch you know I'm throwed off, doctor said I'm not right
Got a white bitch but shes not bright
If the bitch'll blow a nigga for his Snickers then imagine
What the ho would do for a Klondike!
Feelin' like a billion
And then I'm about to kill again
He's on his own island bet them niggas think I'm Gilligan
No resilience I'll pop a nigga, drop a nigga Heath Ledger nigga
I'ma pop a little pill again
What up to my homie Ned Fresh up out the pen again
I shove a muthafucka's head right inside the ceiling fan
Leave a pussy nigga shaking in his Timberlands
D-d-d-d stuttering and tr-tr-tr-tr-trembling
Wake up feeling like a billion bucks
Bitch get to steppin' if you don't fuck
I need a ho to give me futuristic head
Blow me in the space ship, call the bitch, Aeon Flux
Fall off in the club with the heat on tuck
This my year y'all be on suck
Gone off that Charlie Sheen that tiger blood bitch we goin' nuts like

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Okay Jarren, dog I know they scared
When they see me and you together man it's so unfair
The way we killin' these rappers I bet there's no comparin'
Not a fan of they music I hate the clothes they wearin'
And I'm so embarrassed, at the state of my city
Cause everybody rep they hood in the white boy spot
But when they really in the hood, try and tell 'em where they from
They be lookin' at 'em like, "Boy, stop!"
But not me I'm from the north side, feeling like a billion
I'm a Slumerican, honkey-town affiliate
I'm with a resilient, bitch who let me drill her
Afterwards she call me up and say she never wanna chill again
It's too unsafe, my crew untamed, the shit true
My black friends always rob my white friends
My white friends get drunk and start fighting each other
And when they bloody they be like, "Are we tight man?"
And this red light, damn, and this ain’t sharp rap
Drop that shit on the internet when I see you
I'ma tuck my hair inside of my sock hat, cock back
And swing at your jaw, SMACK, somebody better tell him to fall back
The southern hip-hop's Josh Koscheck, prob'ly got a weapon in the Octagon
I'll stop you while my Jimmy Scotts is on
What you thought, come on, it’s my time man your watch is wrong
I’m gone, I’m on a whole 'nother playing field
My name is still buzzin' the fuckin' streets are watchin'
Rollin' up the Sour Deez in the Cut' Supreme
I could spend this cream in the Neiman Marcus
Lookin' clean, you are steamin' -- heap of garbage
You could scheme, homie I’ma be me regardless
People talk a lot of shit, ‘cause I’m an easy target
Eatin' xani bars, drinkin' Thompson, it got me feelin' like a billion...

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Flints own, Flintstone, made this buzz on his own
You ain’t on ya grind, but I stay on mine
So what y'all do? Piss, moan
Y'all niggas real fake, my nigga's Bill Gates
Killin' the industry what a difference a year make!
I’m here for your ear sake, you wanna hear great?
You fuck outta luck, I can hear the mirror break
You niggas so basic -- fly
The 'Stairway to Heaven' yo it lead to my basement
Based in the fucking basement it’s amazing
The Matrix that I haze 'em can't save ‘em
Hits give ‘em Canseco on site, I’m a psycho when I write tho like a rifle
Took all of my rivals, I swear that I bless every track (yup)
Hand on the Bible
Backyard, H squad
I came out the hood nigga just like y’all
Love how I stand on my own two feet
But the haters they pray that I just might fall
Nah, never that, I drop classics, nigga, gimme that
See how my name buzz on the internet
If it’s me against the world then I’m winning that
See? Look, my niggas struggle like five in the bank
You bullshittin' like five in the tank
See I, grind for mine, I earn my shine
So I ain’t got another nigga to thank
Moe Cleaves gave me game at a young age
Say niggas only read what's on the front page
And I know that’s true, so he looked me in my eye and say
"Do what you gotta do to make sure that’s you!" Connor...

[Hook: Jarren Benton][Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, Jarren Benton nigga
Nigga this hard work, hard work
My grandma taught me, "put God first"
And these fuck niggas and my negative words
They wouldn't show me love, I spit a hard verse
You feel the pain inside of my art, worst
So much failure, felt like my heart burst
I came to eat, fuck the horderves
The bully's home, I'm at the [?] nerve
So where the fuck were you when I was hurting?
Success was looking so uncertain
I couldn't afford a fucking christmas day for my daughter
Nigga, I was worthless
Like God what the fuck is my purpose?
Stressing make a nigga feel nervous
I wash away the pain, no detergent
I'mma hit it with the motherfucking bourbon
So fuck you and your lame ass comments, nigga
You don't know me from a fricking comment, nigga
I'm going hard for my nigga Slow, rest in peace
I'm drinking till I vomit liquor
I'mma get richer, I'mma die trying, I'mma die grinding
Kill yourself with a hot iron if you hating nigga
I'm about mine, on Cloud Nine like Jesus nigga
I'm jet skiing on the English river
Counting paper till my fingers shiver
Down Grey Goose like I don't need a liver
Beat it nigga, I'mma chase the rest, cause I ain't high enough
I'm going in till my time is up
But if you think this shit just happened over night
And we ain't paying dues then you blind as fuck

[Hook: Locksmith]
I believe in me, I believe in me
Success is all I see, man it's all I see
I believe in me, I believe in me
Success is all I see, man it's all on me
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off none of these niggas, it's all about
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off none of these bitches, they choosing on
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off what they be saying, they waiting on
Me, me, me, me
My future is all that I see, sheesh

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Yeah and I pray to God as my witness
See I've harbored a sickness
I see life as it is
More than just money, cars and some bitches
I put fright in my peers, so it might come off as auspicious
Such delight when I veered, it was all a conscious decision
Never been a path I would take but mine
Dealing with the past is a waste of time
Nothing you remask can replace what's dying
Whether you adapt, it's a state of mind
Whether you react like a faceless mime
Put it on your back and embrace a [?]
Never been a nigga with a limited vision
I had a mission, I was fishing, but I ain't confined
Fucked in the game would've lost my footing
Things that I did seem so off putting
Had to learn quick if you wanna earn it
Then you have to let go, anyway, that's pulling
Sake for the friends and the hoes you fucked
Till it sinks in, then it slows you up
Whether you're embedded or forget it, you [?]
You can never tell when it's so abrupt
People be talking, the evil is scoffing
With me in the coffin, I meet with the moffin
I what they causing, I leave 'em in caution
I know that they wanna keep me in the margin
I'm paying no mind, cause they mind is corrupt
I divided it up, I know time and discuss
See? I never been trapped by a label
So why would I label my music?
You blinded as fuck, see?

[Hook: Locksmith]
I believe in me, I believe in me
Success is all I see, man, it's all I see
I believe in me, I believe in me
Success is all I see, man, it's all on me
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off none of these niggas, it's all about...
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off none of these bitches, they choosing on...
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off what they be saying, they waiting on...
Me, me, me, me
My future is all that I see, sheesh

[Verse 3: Futuristic]
I came in the game and I'm making a lane
My friends acting strange and they saying I changed
The fame that you claim is perception
[?] that's reckless, progression is what I maintain
I remade the name that they bang in my state
Then I moved to LA, oh my God, they can't wait
To act like they running a city
Without me, when you in a place only I can create
My girlfriend, I left her, I'm missing her face
But how can you cope with this amount of space
She knows all these bitches is after this nigga
She's so insecure, I can't help with the pain
She knows that I'm making this money
I could fly her out, but I bought me a chain
And bought me a whip and bought me a studio
Swear that my next album gon' be insane, sheesh
I believe in me and that's all I believe
I got tunnel vision, promised success is all that I see
I know that I can be anything and that's all Imma be
Seven shows in seven states and I did it all in a week
You weak, sending emojis with winks
I'm laughing cause you can't compete, don't speak
In case you don't know, I been 'round the globe
And you barely been on the street, I'm trying to eat
Go Micky D's when I tell you I'm trying to double my cheese
If you think you fucking me, I'm like a black girl
All I say is "nigga please"[Verse 1: Adamite]
Ugh yea round and round I go like the fucking merry go
So quick I turn the Holy Ghost into holy smoke, Holy Smokes!
Look at that nose on Pinocchio, my dick got the same curse thats why I lie until I blow!
Whoah! Speaking of blowing yes I'm blowing smoke, like a train or locomotive, welcome to the magic show
I'm not a dummy, yes I'm eating with a full tummy, thanking Mickie D associates like thanks Honey, Hahaha Yea
Thanks for the money, drive away in the getaway car while the bass bumping, We cracking up like Humpty Dumpty
But wheres the wall, lights flashing like who & the fuck done went and called the law
Poppin' smarties & Adderall in the backseat, the cop says your under arrest I say who me?
He says yes sir your under the influence, I pulled my hand back slap him like bitch you been stupid

[Hook: Adamite]
Now sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
JARREN BENTON, I chug a pass through and slap you
Doing doughnuts in the parking lot, I hit the median spun out & broke the axel
Deranged lunatic, I walk the block in a speedo, Anchorman 2, I smack you with a bean burrito
Throw a rock up at the sky and accidentally hit an alien, chilling with Australians
Get head from an Israelian, whore I take it out her ass & skeeted on her cranium
I spazz like a Tasmanian, my dick is like titanium, Yea, I bully rappers like Debo
Catch me in the isle at your local Home Depot, stick to the G-Code, shoot at your peep-hole
Gotta big ego, I don't like sharing needles but I will if I have to, Niggas know that cash rules
I got my GED by crashing parties at your Grad-School, mad screws loose inside of my head
I woke up with a dead whore inside of my bed

[Hook: Adamite]
Now sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe

[Verse 3: Adamite]
Jarren! I thought we learned not to fuck whores
Now your laying next to her lifeless & dead corpse
The cops will think the intercourse was more than likely forced
Aww fuck it she opens her legs up more than a door
I panic & run around in a fucking circle
Drop my glasses, jinkies, I'm the white version of Steve Urkel
I can barely move & yea I got an attitude, I just need a bowl of Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup
Glaucoma, mixed with a strange aroma, appeal to the senses, about as appealing as a coma
I'll tear through you like a zombie on some bath salts, don't blame Adamite or Jarren I swear it's not our faults!
No, its not our fault, it's not our fault, it's not our fault, I swear to you it's not our fault!

[Hook: Adamite]
Now sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I punch pussies, fuck sluts, and rob faggots
Pop pills with Uncle Phil and Bob Saget
Sneak [?] inside movies through Rob's jacket
Cut classes to fist whores with small asses
The glue huffer
The used rubber
Your mom stuck up her
'Fore we hit the meth and a few uppers
I cut a ear off cause I ain't feeling y'all
You the cum that's sprayed on Jake Gyllenhaal
I stay billin' all
You squat in cars
You jocking balls like a homo
Can't stand po-po
Only fuck with Spittz, if he dies I'm solo
Obi Wan Kanobi, the Beatgods logo
Haters like "oh no!"
Chuck Norris  dojo
Karate chop a nigga for stealing my mojo
Bitch, take a photo
It'll last longer
Two Cialis pills
My dick is mad stronger
The go realer
The ho stealer
Even white supremacists, they cheer for me
They like "go nigger!"
Watch for them hip-hop robots
It's 6 o'clock, I'm out, your mom's cooking stove-top

[Verse 2: 4ize]
The stove-top cooker
The hookup on your hooker hooker
The buy my CD and get one for free over-looker
The clean
Vigilante
Machine
Origin born with a skeleton, a wolverine
Rap's a [?]
This I command
Lord, a war with military contraband
In Chi-Town
I park the Hummer in an alley
Cause niggas hold guns like the governor of Cali
So I have to find her
And get to her
Before they kill her
My bullets are silver
They bust when I murk werewolves and vampires
4ize throwing snake heads in the campfires
The coup de gras
The lyrical, super ritual
Yeah, cause mercy's for the weak and the pitiful
I give [?] to the devils and the demons
When I loathe the wretchedness of these heathens
And choke on the foul stench of the wickedness
Behold the wrath of God unlimitless
Did rain down fire and brimstone
Weapons of mass destruction in my Sprint phone[Hook: Rock City]
Get fresh 7 days of the week and
Live life everyday as the weekend
That's what we call, call bubbling
Call, call bubble, call, call, call bubbling
Make getting money look so easy
I don't know about you but we eatin'
That's what we call, call bubbling
Call, call bubble, call, call, call bubbling

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Pay attention ladies and gents, it's Jarren Bent
Remember waking up nights feeling like I was shit
Feeling inadequate
Couldn't bring home the bacon
Baby mama bitching
The bread wasn't bakin'
Like a retired doctor I had no patience
Lord show me a sign cause I am sick of waitin'
I'm anticipatin' to get out the situation
Feel like I'm living in hell right next to Satan
Wait, wait, oh, woah, no, this can't be life
All the struggle, all the pain, no this can't be right
It's when I start believing in me
Like a bird soaring through the sky I'm feeling so free

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
What don't kill me only makes me stronger
Baby I'm a motherfucking east side monster
Beast in this game, you can hear his hunger
Growl in his stomach, I came from down under
I do this for Gia
[?] America's nightmare
Family counting on me, I'll be right there
Can't lose
Can't snooze
Greedy like two Jews
Nieces, nephews
Jarren to the rescue
I'm special
If you hating on me, God bless you
I hex you
Negative energy couldn't pierce through
Coming soon to a record store near you
Light years past y'all, looking out my rear view
I'm bubbling

[Hook][Vinnie Paz - Verse I]
Your liver taste exquisite with Chianti
The uppercut is so vicious that it could lift a donkey
I pop pills and cop kill, the visions haunt me
Kill him then bring him back to life and forgive a zombie
Load the shotty up and hit him in the prison lobby
The closest thing you got to pussy is doing bitches laundry
Youz a sucker, motherfucker, and that should alarm me
You ain't carrying hammers, you a fictitious army
Y'all make Drake look hard bodied, that shit appall me
And my money astronomical like Dennis Garvey
Unless you want your fucking head shattered, get up off me
I'm about to break fool on you, catch a hommie
Pull the motherfucking biscuit out catch a body
Italian luxury and I ain't talking Maserati
The fist hit you dead in the chest the kamikaze
The flying monkey is Ozbourne like I was Ozzy

[Jarren Benton - Verse II]
All I need is one mic, three syringes and two rocks
I rap like I got Pac's dead corpse in a shoe box
I'm a retard, Jarren stay on that stupid shit
So disrespectful I slapped Christ off his crucifix
I go to your funeral punch the eulogist
Papa used to tell me that rapping ain't fucking lucrative
That's foolishness dad, you sound ludicrous
Fuck your opinion goddamn it we 'bout to do this shit
Boxcutter hooligan
Look what this blade would do to him
Fuck a fifth of Henny, I could chug a whole pool of gin
Kill him then I stand over his body then I shoot again
Fuck coke, get high off of pesticides and fumigants
I'm an animal, I grew up in the pits of hell
I'm strong enough to punch through the ocean and fucking kill a whale
Scalpels and all sorts of assortments
Bitch, I'm a pimp I can sell shit to a toilet
So scram with your faggot ass
Don't make me let the semi blast
Fuck a gun, don't make me pop the trunk and pull out Vinnie Paz
Y'all some homos, rappers talking 'bout finny bags
Keep the conversation brief but we ain't talking clinic ash
Just read a shitty comment now my day is ruined
You 'bout as gay as a B2K reunion
I'm an innovator give a shit what they were doin'
Rotting flesh pollutes my back yard so now my neighbors movin'
Adidas on my feet, it's never Reeboks
Hops'll say he dropping his album right after Detox
I'm into bestiality, getting head from an Ewok
You niggas got it fucked up like a blood trying to C-walk
I throw you off a tree top, in a Chevy bumping Pete Rock
Bitch I'm off the wall just like fucked up Sheetrock
Doctor Lecter, I eat you rappers get Ethered
Been the shit since Papa skeeted me out his urethra[Intro]
Yeah
Roc N Mayne what up man
What we gone do on this shit right here
I'mma come up with a fly ass hook
I really ain't gone say shit on the verses
Still put these sucka ass niggas in hearses
By the way, I finally sucked my own dick
Leggo!

Snap

[Verse 1]
Live from my grandmama's basement
Camp Crystal Lake, muthafucker I'm Jason
Illuminati membership card, Free Mason
Nah literally free my homeboy Mason
Freebasing, be patient, that's what they telling me
Party for my nigga Ned, he just beat a felony
That be that good shit, my nigga Dizzy mailing me
Lean got a nigga on cruz like Penelope
Need therapy, stressed, don't worry me
Big dick Benton, AKA, Ron Jeremy
When you give me brains, handle my dick carefully
Who the fuck care to be the loser? Bitch marry me!
Suit & Tie shit like Timberlake
I fuck you and then I put your dead body in a lake
Eliminate, disintegrate, sipping on gin and lemonade
Bitch I been a renegade, way before Em and Jay
Whores sick of hearing 'bout Jarren like Kim and Ye
I put a wack rapper on a dinner plate
I penetrate a nigga with ninja blade
I'm 7:30 whipping in a 10 to 8
I'll be there in a minute bitch you finna wait
Lil' Debbie nigga, yeah we getting cake
Drunk driver whipping on the interstate
My girl say her period is really late
I got a home abortion kit, we finna get it straight
Just kidding bitch, good news, that's great!
I hope the president don't ban the fucking AK
My shit wasn't registered anyway
And that's Ice Cube's, fuck niggas like you!

[Hook]
Some of my niggas sell dope
Some of my niggas, they broke
Some of my niggas smoke weed
Some of my niggas snort coke
Some of my niggas, they made it
Some of my niggas they won't
Regardless y'all my niggas, we gone roll
Just like Cadillacs and Chevys

Cadillacs & Chevys (Yeah!) x7

Snap

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they say I sound like Eminem
Mixed with 3K, y'all ain't offending him
Your hoes swing from my balls like a pendulum
If you don't like 'em my nigga get rid of them!
Gon' get to killing them
I'll help ya hide the bodies, I ain't feeling them
I'm high like helium
I'm trying to gross one billion, my kicks reptilian
I'm tryna fuck Christina Milli-an!
Or Millian, phenomenon, I ain't tripping I'll even fuck Chaka Khan
With nothing but a stocking on, y'all niggas ain't eating like Ramadan
You ain't bussin' not even with a hundred guns
Fuck a fat bitch for a honey bun
I'll fuck a nerd down at Comic-Con
Never know the kind of shit that I be on
You be hanging with the maricon (faggot)
I be strangling the microphone, I used to play the xylophone
Macaulay Culkin bitch yeah I ride alone
Yeah bitch I'm in the zone, yeah bitch I'm blowing strong
I'm tryna get it like I'm Puffy Combs
I'm tryna fuck and then she going home
Top gun, welcome to the danger zone
I'll stomp a niggas teeth out with Wranglers on
Pussy ass nigga, gon' get your hating on
And if you know the fuckin' words bitch then sing-a-long!

[Hook][Intro: Jarren Benton]
What up Dizzy?

Jarren, Benton. [scratching noises]

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, fuck these niggas, I don't trust these niggas
Pull the knife out the AK, and cut these niggas
Put the knife back on the AK, I throw the AK away, I get the nunchuck and nunck these niggas
I am, out of my mind, Jarren, you gon' really sniff all of those lines?
Where the fuck were you when I was out on my grind?
Stress bout to blow my brains out of my spine
Insane in the membrane, sick with the pen game, y'all niggas been lame
Frickin' faggot, gagged and fucked in the ass like the Gimp did Ving Rhames
Eastside tyrant, little bit of vibe when I flee from the sirens
I hit a nigga in the leg with a tire iron, and crack him in the fucking skull with a fire hydrant
I'm a beast, I'm a god, I'm a killer, I'm a pimp, and I walk with a limp
You're a geek, you're a lame, you're a bitch, you're a fag, bitch you talk with a lisp
Like "Hey Dizz, pull your dick out, all we wanna do is party"
Meanwhile, I'm with your fucking baby mom at the drive-thru at Hardy's
She say "Yeah, I thought you were ballin'", bitch you see the Hardy's at Arby's
Bougie ass trick still let a nigga hit, so I fucked her in the back of an RV
What up to my nigga named Dizzy, hoes throw the pussy at a nigga like a frisbee
Hatin' ass niggas gon' hate, better load up the guns, till the pussy ass niggas come kill me, feel me
Chop ya, body up, put it in my locker, freeze it, cook it, put it in my pasta
The chopper go 'brah' in your mouth like binaca, drop ya, call the fucking coroners and doctors
Duct tape and rape ya, As-Salāmu `Alaykum, killers from Jamaica, they gon' let you meet your maker
Funk Volume bitch, we don't need a fucking major, Mr Benton sickest motherfucker from Decatur

[Hook]
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
Okay, they let me loose and I'm at it
Bitch I’m noose neckin' this rap shit
Got a gang of hoes on my matress
You a bitch nigga, you manson
Man I'm too much for you niggas
I could murder you on yo own song
Give my flow some turbo
End up breakin niggas like O-zone
Kill a nigga quicker than a mili to his temple
Drag his fuckin' body beneath the 2 cylinder
You too weak, and me I’m too villainous
Ain't shit safe bitch I ain't through killin' it
Bitch I'm hard as I do claim, bitch I'm harder than you claim
I get on anybody’s song and make that shit part of my food chain
Boom, bang, bang, boom, bitch back, back better gimme some room
I got a wild mind, I'm on a million shrooms
Codeine cups look like a million prunes
I'm ill, and I want it, those two deadly components
Anything I'm in, I always win
Can’t even picture havin' opponents
Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
They done fucked up, fetch the bong
Remix bitch I'm extra on
I’m rollin weed, overseas
Funk Volume bitch we finna set the tone
Can’t trust 'em, fuck it, put em' in a bucket
Wanna see my dick so you could hug it?
Came a long way for niggas to fuck with me the long way
Independent on the motherfucking budget
Man I’m never putting this mic down, right now it's my lifestyle
Change your lives on a high cloud, I got marijuana all in my white owl
So the hoes wanna hit it, niggas get to witness the bitches that really groupie for a livin'
I’m at the show, she at the front, now she at the hotel trying to get the motherfuckin' business
Hold up, hold up, why everybody on my dick?
Is it cause I rip songs, hit bongs, with hit songs and niggas wonder how I'm getting on like this
Damn, find another lover
Can't trust 'em cause we tired of each other
Brother, Las Vegas will never have another
Tell XXL want the motherfuckin' cover[Intro: Jarren Benton]
Yeah
It's a dedication bitches
Outkast
Jarren Benton
Jawz Of Life
My nigga Stanza
Let's go
Niggas get jacked like Daniel
Something I can handle
Come on
I told you that bitch ain't dead nigga

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Listen
This is my story, this is my song
And to the pussy niggas don't attempt to try this at home
My brain's gone
Mama I ain't coming home
See I done fucked around and slipped into the unknown
I get the weirdest feeling that we are not alone
I think they listen to us when we on the telephone
I'm up late night like I'm on a telethon
Performing open heart surgeries on microphones
Death to the negative niggas and [?]
Who say that they don't understand the shit that I be on
That you don't understand God, life's hard
I try to touch a nigga's soul through his iPod
Then I jog
Through opticals
I done seen shit through my opticals
Nigga pain was an option though
But yet sky's still the limit
I am Jarren Benton, not a motherfucking gimmick
Never been shot
Never slung rocks
Try to give the people hope through the form of hip hop
Rip my heart out my chest and put it on the pad
And give it to the world motherfucker that's swag

[Hook]
Do you know what bring rats, mice, snakes up out they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, hip hop's alive

[Verse 2: Jawz Of Life]
And doing quite well
If it died it done reincarnated through JOL
Hell
I've been on my feet I mean I've been in my shells
Before flip phone sales
Before toothpaste was gel
Before [?] mall had a store called Zales
Before you told your sister "I'm-a tell"
My throat provided hope
To the blind man I'm the braille
To the deaf I'm the hearing
Aid for the listenin'
We've been on a mission
Since Jesus went fishin' with Peter
Kicking peppers cut 'em up with egg after Easter
On the tater salad watch me [?] want it but she got me instead
A real King like Don
Or Juan
With dream
Regime
With dungeon but still my team

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stanza]
When I'm diving off the highest diving board, no splash
In the square I circle you Urkels, I whoop your ass
The blackjack Johnson
Tyson with the tattoo
I make you bitches suck my johnson
This is the interview
Now there are ten of you on top
Your rhymes compared to mine
Are tennis shoes and I'm flyin'
The blocks you say are old are the ones I call home
So you're lyin'
I'm a lion
And you're fucking with my pride
Now it's on your popcorn nigga
The same song I couldn't manage [?]
Now my arm strong
Go Goliath and David at the same time
The only guy stopping me is me
I put the slingshot down
Samson with no hair
Been lying to niggas don't go there
I bible niggas just to show no care
This is the new basic
I am Stanza
You should hate me

[Hook]

[Outro: Jarren Benton]
I feel like
All these close minded ass niggas in my own city
Won't even let your boys in the game right now
It's a whole different part of the south that got some shit to say
You know what I'm saying
No disrespect to the rest of y'all niggas
But we ain't just snapping in traffic
We got some real motherfucking shit to say
But we can't be stopped
You know what I'm saying
That's all I got to say[Hook]
I never been a punk bitch I ride with a shotgun
They know I got guns so tell the fuckers come get it
???
I'mma stand right here where I am so ay motherfucker come get it
Get it (x6)
Motherfucker come get it
Get it (x6)
Motherfucker come get it

[Verse 1: Trayne]

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Got a semi automatic
In the cut a hole cera
One time a mara
Put a fucking hole in your Porsche panamera
Terra
Drop a n*igga off in the sahara
Leave a nigga shaking like Shakira
Two twin Glock 45s caught a mothercking ??
Kill a nigga then I change clothes
I’m back on the block with a Spanish guitar and a sombrero

Put him in the trunk
Put him in the dump
Get him in the head with a sawed-off pump
Throw a chansaw at the nigga
Let the alligator get him
Cut him up I put his body in the swamp
Gotta get it baby hey I’m starving
Take me to your leader im a deranged martian
Kick down your fucking front door
With no mask just a gun and a hoodie like im trayvon martin

Beg your pardon?
Look here bitch you know what you startin’?
Pull a switchblade out my wrist
Kick a nigga in the chest
Tell a motherfucker bitch this sparta

Stainless steel
Klick klack aim and kill

Yo Spittz you know what fucking kills me?
When I be hearing motherfuckers saying
Yo I had a fucked up day
My day this, my day that
But nigga I'm like shut the fuck up nigga
Nobody had a more fucked up day than me, you know what I'm saying?
And I ain't bullshitting about this, this some crazy shit
So y'all sit back, bring out the popcorn, and listen, alright?
Put the children to bed, pop two pills, take a couple shots to the head
Sit back and listen
Check this shit out

[Verse 1]
Uh
Raised in Decatur
Hung around skaters
Stomp a nigga out with my Charlie Brown gators
Your mom said I raped her
Cause I duck taped her
And she woke up next to me passed out holding a razor
I'm on some bad pack shit
Sick of this rap shit
Sick of being stuck in this Atlanta traffic
Hop out of my car
I walk to the bar
Order Hangar 1 in a real big jar
I spit a couple bars
I met a bitch with SARS
We huffed a tube of glue until we started seeing stars
She took me up to Mars
I met a guy named Charles
With two wooden legs and some nasty war scars
I went back home and popped two Pop-Tarts
That's when I heard a voice saying Allāhu Akbar
Open the front door and there's my homie Clyde
I said what's up and gave him a high five
Maybe we'll get high
Maybe we'll sky dive
I looked at the clock and it's a quarter past five
My nigga's acting weird
He started scratching his beard
I started getting scared cause ooze dripped from his ear
His mouth started foaming, his eyes turned red
I grabbed the kitchen knife and stuck it in his head
He passed out dead
I grabbed him by the legs
Drug him outside and stuck him in a tool shed
Went back to the house
And sat on a couch
Watched Golden Girls marathon until I passed out
Woke up the next morning with drool on my chin
It's a new day and I do this shit again
I know what you're thinking, he's a fucking liar
I hope he freaking dies, goes to hell and burns in fire
The moral of the story, there is none dammit
I'm a dope rapper and my name is Jarren
I vouch for myself, this guy's sick
The fucking Beatgods, they make hits
If you got a label please sign me quick
But first you got to find me and suck my dick
