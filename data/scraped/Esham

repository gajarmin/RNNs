You don't know me I'm the unholy soley time patrolly
I clock crazy credits and don't rhyme for rollies
Still bustin at the police know least one of my bullets
Will hit my enemy in his face when this trigger, I pull it
I'm twisted like a psychopath, I write my rhymes in blood
I don't got a DJ cause I a-cut him up
They won't let me on MTV I'd beat up Carson Daly
And remind Eminem of DiAngelo Bailey
Hailie's in a coma, Hailie's in a coma
I smell the aroma, of a dead body
Chemi-cal imbalance Chemi-cal imbalance
Chemi-cal imbalance Chemi-cal imbalance
Drugs, thugs, slugs, niggas get plugged
At a early age up in Detroit, nigga what?!
Hustla, get yo trick on
Ho, tell em who dick you want
Shit! I'mma lunatic in this bitch
I wanna blow my own head off, Kurt Cobain style
I think if I was dead I'd be better off now
Chemi-cal imbalance Chemi-cal imbalance
Chemi-cal imbalance Chemi-cal imbalance[Parliament-Funkadelic sample (from "Maggot Brain"):]
"Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time
For y'all have knocked her up
I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the Universe
I was not offended
For I knew I had to rise above it all
Or drown in my own shit."

"Mother Earth is pregnant ---" x6
"Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time"

[Esham]
Why would you want to make a life in this world we live in?
Love ain't worth a dime, so then you nothin to give him
The baby had no father, he ran out on the mama
So raise him as a cannibal to be like Jeffrey Dahmer
Your life is really worthless: you live, and then you die
You're gonna die, and bodies rot and then you wonder why
And then you live in doubt:
Can you live or live without?
The facts you know, you can't afford to feed another mouth
Your head is steady spinnin
The Devil's steady grinnin
While you was steady sinning
From the very first beginning
Is it a boy or a girl?
I think I should be feral
You should terminate it, because it's a lousy world
Your life is on the line
You're out your fuckin' mind
You gotta do it soon, cause you're runnin' outta time
It's just another embryo attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though

[Esham]
The baby's premature
The mother is a whore
Contemplatin suicide, so what you waitin for?
I think I heard it kicking, but that's a normal state
Jam a hanger in ya asshole until your water breaks
You better use some caution
Givin' yourself an abortion
Death's the only way to solve a suicide solution
So here's my contribution
My suicide solution
You play the game of death, but then you can't win or lose it
You wonder if you want this
Or should you kill the fetus?
Life is just a waste, so then you oughta just delete this
"Problem to society"?
Society's the problem
My suicide solution is a .38 revolver [gunshot]
I'm your problem solver
Your life is full of horror
Some are born today, and some will die tomorrow [girl screams]
Vaginal tissue's torn
Your pussy's kinda worn
I think I oughta warn you if you're having a new boy
You're in your own perspective
There is one contraceptive
Your EPT is positive
So you can't let that baby live
It's just another embryo attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though

[Esham]
The planet's really fucked
So now you're kinda stuck
You should have thought about it before you busted the nut
It is a lousy world, I live a lousy life
I think I oughta stab ya in the stomach with a knife
Or push you down a flight of steps
Until you fall and break ya neck
Did a little damage
Can you manage a miscarriage?
Life is not a choice, death is the alternative
Or should you let it grow up in this fucked up world that we live in?
These are the consequences
Add one more to the State Census
Born to die in poverty, so tell me, what's its sisters?
It's just another embryo attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though

"When another number girlfriend comes along, he'll think of ME when he fucks her!" (Repeat till fade)[Verse 1: Dice]
I'm hanging like scrotum sacks
Doing drive-bys in Cadillacs
Smoking niggas while they smoking (unintelligible lyrics)
Niggas getting wet up like stamps
I'm blowing out brains quick as I'm blowing out amps
It's like nasty ass no good hookers
I got bullets ripping through car doors, hundreds of subwoofers
When I was a little boy drinking Hi-Cs
I was murdering Capricorns, Libras and Pisces
I sees my neighborhood sewed up, hold up
Got slowed up, enemies get dropped for showed up
Pitbulls gets blown up with no delay
I blew away my next door neighbor's Bouvier
Careless, greasy motherfuckers like spare ribs
In Detroit sticking up stores owned by Arabs
Before I was born twice, from knowledge to torn
I smoked a nigga for blowing his horn
Chaotic, never nervous
Smoking a nigga of the Internal Revenue Service
While some niggas I know be flipping keys
I be flipping them motherfuckers at Mickey Ds

Deep, deep below...through the muck and the snow
Fear is found below...through the muck and the snow

[Verse 2: Esham]
Woke up sweating bullets
My vision is Brillo
Sleep with the .357 up under my pillow
I have dreams of bullets coming up at me in my direction
Tied down to the bed for my own protection
Institutionalized, I metamorphosize
Into Jesus, tied down and I'm crucified
The devil burns me
Holy water makes my skin blister
He slit my wrist cause I'm a Suicidalist
I seen many faces of death
Dead men don't sing no songs
No singing at my funeral
Visions of my burial
Closed casket, six feet, born dead at birth
How much is my life worth
If I'm under the Earth
Psychiatric treatment, therapeutic, help me dispute it
It's coincidental what goes on in my mental
I have cravins' of black ravens on my tombstone
So you can sleep if you can
I'm having dreams of a dead man

Dead men don't sing
Dead men DO dream
About being alive
You know, all the way live

[Verse 3: Dice (freestyle)]
Word is born
Then I storm
With the wickedness
Come get with this
Deranged nigga with the 12-gauge
I be jacking all you niggas while I'm macking, yeah
Too many styles I have like a crab on my nuts
I scratch like maestro with cuts
But nobody knows my style so I don't give 'em no time
To learn 'em, bitches I burn 'em
With syphilis
I kill your mama and your mistress
Don't dis this
The Dice is in this bitch so don't miss this
Cause I be freestyling, wilding like a mongoose
Fuck with the rhyme I got more juice than O.J. Simpson
No glimpsin'
Bad nigga, rough nigga, rhyme nigga
Fuck around with me I'll pull my rhyme trigger
Oh shit RLPs coming down with that old school shit
James, suck my dick
Hey yo Dice is in this joint now
And it's fucked up, nobody knows about being fucked up
But when I want to get stupid I get lazy
Bitches be sucking my dick and I nut in their mouth crazy
So check it out baby I Swayze like Patrick
Fuck around with me, I'm fucking fat bitches on mattresses
Who wanna fuck with the team
Esham the Unholy, Dice and the...

[Outro: Razzaq]
Insane, gore Razzaq Rahim

As the sky turns grey
Niggas roam through the night
As the rain fall upon us
Lightning strikes like a bullet to the temple
The fog gets thicker, RAAARGH!
Mothers screams for their life or death
Breaths is tooken, by another man

At war!
We're at WAAAAARRR![INTRO: DEADBOY]
Yeah!
Let me get one of those big motherfuckers and shit in there
You know what I'm saying?
I'm back in this bitch!
Just like Ice-T, you motherfuckers should have killed me last year!
Yeah, in the house with my motherfucking brother Esham
You know what I'm saying?
Getting a little too much power for these motherfuckers!

[VERSE 1: ESHAM]
Sick in the head
So I tried to kill a priest
I'm thinking of excuses
Instead of killing me
The Symptoms of Insanity's got me going psycho
Friday the 13th just like Michael
If I get wreck
Then I wreck when I wreck it
When I mic check
1, 2 when I check it
Looking for excuses just to get ill
How many cops can one man kill
Many, plenty, all if any
A penny for your thoughts
But death is what you bought
From a public enemy, public figure
Not your regular nigga
Like a rusty razor but I'll faze you like a taser
Think of Malice Green
And then I get Deja Vu
Then I get voodoo wicket
Slide a rusty razor across your throat then I stick it
Shit goddamn, goddamn shit
Suck my dick when the heater goes click
And by the way, fuck you man
Goddamn, you better murder me man

[HOOK]
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)
You better murder me man
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)

[VERSE 2: ESHAM]
You better murder me man
Before some nigga get hurt
Let a nun suck my dick in the back of the church
Another one bites the dirt
When I put in work
Shit, you're talking to an expert
The Tazmanian Devil
Black Devil
That Devil you don't know
And don't want to know
Cause I'm kind of like a head hunter, jack
Chop it off and I'm gonna, black
You know I want to, black
Can't no, ain't no if, ands, or buts
When my dick swings low
I'm dropping my nuts to the flo'
Slap a ho, and let her know
Lick the hairs on my nuts
Or better yet my afro
Big nigga, cooped up gorilla
And like Ice-T, I'm a fucking cop killa
Motherfuck the Ku Klux Klan
You better murder me man

[HOOK]
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)
You better murder me man
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)

[VERSE 3: ESHAM]
Redrum redrum
Murder murder murder
Standing in my way
Then I got to hurt ya
Never get happy
Hair always nappy
You'll get slapped, G
Unholy pappy
Visions of bloody bodies
Bloody bodies of vision
My mind and suicide
Head on collision
I vision an incision
Some psycho decision
Psychedelic funking
Slam jam dunking
This is do or die
So I'd rather be dead
Cops get outta line
Off with their heads
I flex the text
And break some fucking necks
Me and a nun had sex
And special effects
Make me crazy, mad, boy I'm fucking bad
You couldn't even had all the problems I've had
Psycho sick, suck my dick
Abracadabara, black magic
Voodoo wicket, wicket voodoo
Scare you, go boo
Funky doodoo
I'm wicket, standing with my gat in my hand
You better murder me man

[HOOK]
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)
You better murder me man
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)

[OUTRO: DEADBOY]
Yeah, bitch!
How the fuck you going to kill a dead man, motherfucker?
Don't you know I've been dead, motherfucker?
You nigga!
I'm the motherfucker that gave you eyes, bitch!
You seeing through my eyes, motherfucker!
You know who I'm talking to, bitch!
This is Deadboy, motherfucker!
When you try and creep bitch
I'm going to get your motherfucking ass![Talking]
Pill me for my addiction
Feel my prescription
Try everything, I've tried everything
Check this shit out

I be that Egyptian who need a prescription (So what's poppin?)
Pain pills, feel my addiction
I'm caught up in the mix and plus I need fixin'
This is fact not fiction, bitch, why you bitchin'
Take a listen witcha ears and close ya mouth
Wash it down wit' some water before ya pills fall out
In the darkness I hear somebody call out my name
When I think about the past all I see is the flames
Angels try and save me but I'm crazy
They say 'Follow me' but I can't fly wit' these broken wings
And 'Tongues' are spoken things
Don't know what they mean, nightmares that I'm a dope fiend
Insomniac, I don't sleep, I can't dream
The voices say 'Follow me' the pills say 'Swallow me'
I gotta migraine, dead brain cells
Amphetamines flowin' through my veins takin' me to hell
Can't you tell I'm in another dimension
Can't you tell I'm in another dimension
Hell on earth and I got a life sentence
The only way to get to Heaven's repentance

(Chorus)
[Jill O'Neil]
Pill me for my addiction, feel my prescription, baby
[Esham]
I'm ya pain killa [2x]

I'm a pain killa, a game killa
The one you come to when ya need the same killa
Footprints in the sand walkin' witcha
The shadow behind you who can getcha
Thoughts of suicide run through my mind
I think about murderin' murderers all the time
I close my eyes and turn into vapors
Smokin' blunts in the Bible papers
My mind travels at light speed
'Cuz I speed in the fast lane swervin', my eyes bleed
Now let me tell you what I need
Pussy, pain killas, pills, and weed
Maybe a world without greed
Until then, all my words you must heed
And do believe, alter ya mind state
You'll never find fate, you'll never find love, you'll only find hate
Wait, for goodness sake don't act fake
And baby, these pills relieve my headache
From the cemetery I watch the dead wake
Enough dope to make all the feds shake

(Chorus) [4x]

Enemies wanna kill me up, pill me up
And squeeze they triggas 'till they slugs fill me up
Now, who wanna try me, crucify me
Wanna assassinate the holder of ya fate
'Cuz you'll do anything for the dopamine
Ain't no hope it seems for another dope fiend
O.D.'in in the dope house ya be in
Layin' dead witcha eyes open, forever seein'
'Cuz ya pillin', you be pillin'
Pill, pill, pill
Pill me, you just pill me
You just pill me[HOOK]
Some old Wicketshit (for you) (x4)

[VERSE 1]
Midnight's the Witches Hour
And you're outside
Somebody played the Reel Life Product tape
And committed suicide
Trying to save your soul, it can't be done
Unholy to the son of Satan, I ain't the one
Congratulations brothers and sisters who prayed for me
Some slayed for me and still pray for me
I made a rhyme Satanic, it'll make you vomit
And I think I'm the shit
When it comes down to it
You knew it and know it
Satan's poet, your mind I'll blow it
If you ever heard me rhyme for the first time
Hear, it's like a hurricane, stun you like Novocain
Simple and plain, Reel Life Products is insane
Your're fucking with the wrong one
Listen 'til the song's done
Fuck around and be on the wrong end of a gun, son
You're listening to insanity
But that's just the man in me
I said I'm Esham and you said, "How can it be?"
I'm a psychopathic, automatic
Reel Life Product, pro-static
Fuck it

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
I'm the automatic, funky motherfucker named Esham
Champs and chumps, step up and get some punk
Playing around with me is like playing with a rattlesnake
I shake, and bake, and break the fake
E-S-H-A-M
I'm him, not one of them
Reel Life Product's grim
A schizophrenic motherfucker future's looking dim
A R-E-A-L
A L-I-F-E
A P-R-O-D to the U-C-T
Reel Life Product's what I spelled out, very seldom yell
Some record selling suckers, dope we sell
I have the mind of the Devil
The body of Lucifer
Give me a mic and watch me get loose for you
Convince a motherfucker that suicide's the way
Another homicide, I'll live another day, I lied
I said I was the Unholy, cause the preacher told me
Living in Hell all my life and the Devil molded me
Into his own image, read the Scriptures
I'm Satanic, fuck ya'll bitches
Fuck it

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Holy God, fuck the joys
Here comes Reel Life Products and the Devil's noise
You can't escape it
You might as well tape it
And listen, and listen until it's your favorite
The speakers are smoking
Niggas choking
I'm provoking
No joking
Motherfuckers hoping
That I get off the mic and shut up forever
But that's a dream that'll never come true, never
I'm insane, it's hard to maintain my mentality
If you keep listening you'll have the Devil's personality
Fuck it

[HOOK]

This is my song (for you) (repeats)We are gathered here today
On this sorrowful occasion
To say goodbye to the dearly departed
In other words, the nigga dead
Whether or not you can survive death
That's the ultimate test for your ass, ain't it?
So far, don’t nobody we know have passed the ultimate test
Least of all this nigga laying here
Cause this boy wasn't shit
I’m gonna tell you that right off
I saw him kicking his mama’s ass over there on 47th Street
And if you think we gonna bury you with them diamonds and shit on
You got another thing coming
I’d like to introduce the boy’s woman, ho, bitch
I don’t know what she was
She’s laying over there in the booth
Say girl, what you doing?
Well, don’t sell no pussy in here
If you do, I want a cut
Shit, your fault the nigga dead"Today boys and girls we have a special speaker in the house tonight
And he's gonna teach you about life and death"

I was born a God damn failure
Dropped outta school, let me tell ya
Found me a nickel and lost a dime
My whole life story came true in a rhyme
I don't know what the fuck was on my mind
I tried suicide 4 or 5 times
Tried to take a razor to my wrist but it didn't work
And it seems I'm the only one that's gettin' hurt
Now I gotta bullet in the chamber, dripping sweat
I decide to play a game of Russian Roulette
Click, click, click I guess I loose I didn't win
So I decide to do it again and again
Now it's gettin' borin' cause I keep on loosin'
I guess I'm kinda cruisin' for a bruisin'
Then I take a knife and put a 6 in my head
3 times then I say I wish I was dead
Blood drippin' off my forehead
And then I'm lyin' in my deathbed, but I'm not dead
I gotta headache so I'm gettin' somethin' for it see
I take some Tylenols, about 23
So what you wanna follow me
I got 13 ways to commit suicide

Who would like to hang from a tree?
"I would I would," then listen close to me
You get some sturdy rope and put it 'round your neck
Tie a real good knot, or the shit won't work
It's best to put it in a noose
Just incase you have second thoughts you can't get loose
Now we're at number 6
This a real goody no special effects or countertricks
Tie a big rock to your foot no mistakes
Then jump your ass in a deep lake
Get yourself some gas, then drink that shit
Then drink some more, then you smoke the cigarette
Or better yet, get real drunk and take a real long drive
On the freeway down the wrong side
Brother you're bound to make a hit
It's like lettin' a pitbull suck a dick
So if you wanna follow me
I got 13 ways to commit suicide

Now we're on number 11
Did you know suicidalists didn't go to heaven?
'No where they go man?" take another guess
Matter fact take another suicidal test
This is what you do man
Go jump your monkey ass off a real tall building
And then you live through that one
You get reincarnated mean you get to come back son
But I seriously doubt that
Cause you been tryin' to kill yourself you don't give a shit about that
All you wanna do is die
Maybe motherfuckers kill themselves but don't know why
But I know why I'm teachin' you this
"Why?" Should you have to kill yourself, you don't miss
To prevent a miss, you put a gun in your mouth
And blow your fuckin' brains out
Fuck your mommy, fuck your daddy, nobody cares
Look how they treated you over the years
What you oughta do is kill them then you
A suicidalist dream come true
So if you wanna follow me
I got 13 ways to commit suicide[INTRO]
Yeah, I gotta let these niggas know once again
There ain't nothing wicket like this here wicket, Wicketshit
You know what I'm saying, yeah
So if you didn't catch it the first time
I'm going to hit your ass up like this
Two times on your ass

[VERSE 1]
One nine nine four
I'm out for the dough
Fuck a ho
And bitches can't fade me like an afro
My flow is wicket, some doubt what we say
The Unholy, Black Devil, Kunta Kinte
I'm down with NATAS and that Blaz4Me
And niggas can't see me in 3D
I'm coming at your ass straight from the East side
And I'm in the belly of the beast, right
Niggas don't know the time
I'll put a gun in your mouth
And let the taste blow your mind
Sleepy niggas awake
You're faker than a silicone titty with the shakes
I makes more bounce to the motherfucking ounce
And Esham's how it's pronounced, bitch
I hit the switch
Cause I got that shit hooked up
And my shit's pure before it's cooked up
Mo' money, that's what it's all about
Young hoes, it's all about dick in your mouth
Unholy nigga with the Reel Life crew
We talk about real life shit we been through
Fuck the Reverend, 187 and fuck Heaven
Cause the Wicketshit will never die
I'm doing it 24/7

[HOOK]
I do it like this ya'll, a like this ya'll
I do it like that ya'll, a like that ya'll
(I'm doing it 24/7)
4x

[VERSE 2]
More niggas getting served
Cause I'm twice as nice with the verbs
I don't believe in God so fuck what you heard
This ain't no gimmick
So don't mimic my style of rappin'
Niggas can't fuck with my Fleetwood mack, and
Plus I'm phat and
All of that and this and mo'
I'm quick to take your ends and dis your ho
No singing at my funeral
Just a little something I thought you should know
If your pussy stink, you need some douching ho
As I choose my flow up
My mind to blow up, to make you throw up
Jacking my dick and so what I make it nut, but uh
You better watch the shit as I kick it
My shotgun said Blaz4Me
I'm still wicket, as I stick it
Straight up your ass, and pass the J
Niggas from Detroit don't play, hey
You better raise up
And watch me blaze up
Another cigarette
How hard can another fucking nigga get
I'll whip a clip out if you want to trip out
And shut your mouth Reverend
Cause my dick might slip out, uhhh
I don't give a fuck about Heaven
Cause the Wicketshit will never die
I'm doing it 24/7

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
I got a suicidal problem
My problem solver is a revolver
My mama wants me to get therapy
I don't involve her
Cause I'm wicket
I like to kick it like no other
James Smith, yeah that's my brother
I know you heard of him
We like to smother suckers
Unlike them other suckers
We cause a ruckus
Make the police want to buck us
So fuck us, if you want to try
Some nigga said I was dead
But the Wicketshit will never die
I'm coming straight from the cradle to the grave, ya'll
And motherfucker, I could never be a slave, ya'll
I pack a gat and that's for real though
But see I'm nice with my hands
And plus these fucking steel toes
I thought you knew it was just like this
I'm down to the end cause I'm a Suicidalist, yo
Where all my peoples at, East or the West side
North side, South side, homicide
It don't matter, ain't no thang to me
Cause it's all in D-E-T-R-O-I-T
I stay true to my city
Now ain't that a pity
I chopped off a gangsta ho titty
My attitude's just like Frank Nitti, shitty
All 24/7

[HOOK]

[OUTRO]
This goes out to all my niggas
That's true to the motherfucking city, yeah
And ain't nothing, nothing wicket
Like this here wicket Wicketshit
Ya'll still don't know[Esham]
I know this bitch who like to suck on dick
I call the ho magic cause she's a trick
Now this bitch I knew fucked my buddy
Even though the pussy was wet and bloody
I never ever once thought about fuckin the ho
It seems like a dick always stuck in the ho
She's an undercover freak, like a nigga and his thang
Payin top dollar just to pop that thang
Oh no, the bitch got a fatal disease
She can't keep dick out her ovaries
She like a nigga with money just a project ho
How many dicks can one ho blow ?
I think I seen her after church suckin on the preacher's dick
Every Sunday night, gettin two dollar licks
See bitches ain't shit on planet earth
Make your balls turn blue like Papa Smurf
And if you bitches don't know I'm tellin you so
And if you givin up the pussy like that, you just a 2 dolla ho

[Hook]
What do we get for ten dollars
A two-dolla ho
Bitch don't front you just a two-dolla ho                    6x

[Esham]
Bitch so saditty, actin all pretty
Niggas don't know bloods comin out your titties
Now I respect hoes that respect they self
But I can't fuck pussy that's bad for my health
Just like Jackie, bitch so tacky
Hit her with the Kriss Kross call me daddy mackie
It's alot hoes out there playin dike
Bitch, I ain't goin out like Mike
Better raise up off these nuts and get a grip
Cause in the 9-4, bitch don't trip
Two-dolla, can't holla straight checkin a ho
And I don't give a fuck about respectin a ho
Cause if you a dog, you gon bone
Fuck that pussy then leave it alone
And if you a ho, you gon follow
Dicks and nuts and learn to swallow[VERSE 1]
Listen cause this is the sound of a crucifix
The U-N-H-O-L-Y is now in the looser mix
Unholy is inside of me so I get homicitis
The unholy poetry is for all the Suicidalists
I'm just another brother from D-E-T-R-O-I-T
I pack a Smith & Wesson cause I don't know Karate
I ain't no punk nigga, pulling triggers is my thing though
Give myself an afro, never sported a Kangol
Niggas I strangle, they don't wanna tangle
Fuck a priest cause I mash and mangle
I'm taking it to the top, I'm making 'em drop
They thinking I'm not
I'm shaking 'em, baking 'em, kicking 'em, sticking 'em
And always keep hitting 'em
Until I get rid of them, I'm picking up the microphone
To kick the funky D-O-P-E, E is on the microphone
I had to make it funky once again for my opponent
I left the stage full of blood stains cause I was on it
The U-N-H-O-L-Y: Esham, you never knew I
Could kick it so wicked, inflict pain, do I?
Of the U-N-H-O-L-Y, hell I kick a lot of titles
But this is for all the Suicidalists

"My father was a priest, cold blooded, he's dead"
"Then heard the demon screamin' as his body bled"
"My father was a priest, cold blooded, he's dead"
"Poured on the holy water, 'bless the dead' is what I said"

[VERSE 2]
Some say I'm the son of Satan, but they're relatin'
Bodily harm, some waitin' for the storm
That I bring when I sing, it's a gathering of people
The U-N-H-O-L-Y so check out the evil
Knievel, not his [???] that the wicked poetry funk
Esham's the soul that I'm projecting huh?
I'm like a deadly disease, three hundred and sixty degrees
Of the U-N-H-O-L-Y so fall to your knees
Death is all around, the sounds'll pound down
And drive you insane, until it busts your brain
I'm a head banger, a Acid Rap singer
Coming on stage putting up my middle finger
Saying "fuck it" and grabbing my balls
All the MC's in the house got shit in their drawers
Cause I'm the scarer, a one man terror
So never compare a sucker with me cause I run 'em like mascara
So no need, to tell you my title cause you know what my title is
This is for all the Suicidalists

"I looked into her eyes and she was scared as hell"
"A homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies"
"Dreaming of the people I dismantle"
"To stop her nerves from jumping I just cut her to bits"

[VERSE 3]
Death is the penalty if you're ever caught biting me
Some say I'm insane but it's my split personality
The groove is just wicked, it's wicked so it makes me shake
I thought this time I'd make a rhyme and do what it takes
To suckers trying to copycat I'll have to get my gat
And bust you in the head for trying to steal my Acid Rap
Esham's here just for this verse
The U-N-H-O-L-Y rocks it much worse
Rock and roll, heavy metal hip hopster
Word After Word 'til the break of dawn, brother
Fucking A, as I play
To the rhythm that I just kicked today, I'm going to sway
And keep on kicking it for the ones who buy this
The needle's on the wax for all the Suicidalists

"I'm a ho so I do it like a G.O."
"I just educate minds to reality"
"Oh shit damn that's a no-no"
"So you weak ass hoes keep dreaming""Assholes, bastards, fucking cunts, and pricks"

The black devils back and gotta step into the mix
The brand new rhymes and the 6 6 6
I shipwreck shit, shit gets wrecked
When I hit the set what the fuck you expect?
PO be a motherfuckin' but a two timin' bitch
I'm not a crossover, don't plan to switch
I rob the rhythm like I was a witch
Nine dead bodies throw 'em in the ditch
You wanna try me out to come and test my style
I'll cut 'cha head off and throw it in the pile
I'm versatile, the voodoo child
Don't sweat the technique, but peep the tech style
Gettin' wicked cause I'm raisin' hell
Doin' just as well to bust a brain cell
The unholy, shup, man
6 6 6 and a mic in my hand

(CHORUS)(repeated)
6 6 6 and a mic in my hand
6 6 6 and a mic in myyyyy hand

The U-N-H-O-L-Y flow for the track
Cut your head off and fuck you so I know where you're heads at
Might slip n slide yo and if it's not a wet one
After I bust my nut on George Jetson
And leave no doubts
I'll put my foot up in your ass and kick your fuckin' pussy out
I'm not a romantic, I leave 'em panting
I'm a psychotic, lunatic, pschitsophrantic
I gotta tattoo of a dick on my foot
So when I kick you in your ass I'll be fuckin' you up too
Roll wit me, roll wit me
If I chopped off your head the police'll come and get me
I gotta ax for all the new jacks
When I swing I know where your heads at

(CHORUS)

I'm the mister with the musical mad shit
Mannick depressant, but it's still kinda bad shit
I can get funky too
Or break me a good car like a honkey too
But I'm no white boy
I'll slit your throat in the middle of the night, boy
Killers don't talk, but stalk the streets
I'm like a cannibal cookin' some dead meat
I'm down with RLP
25 preachers in a church couldn't save me
I roll like a maniac
Some say I'm insane for that, rap brainiac
Listen to the funky drummer
Or listen to the screams of the victims of Jeffrey Dahmer
Plus you don't understand
You can't kill a dead man

(CHORUS)

(repeat)
6 6 6

(CHORUS)[Intro]
Rude Boy sittin pancaked on 23s
Clown love to Chicage Juggalos
We underground like Blaze (My Dead Homie)
And yours
We dead, we dead, no wait a minute......we don't die
We don't die. We Dead

(Violent J)
Maybe I like bloody, murder music
You know shit like "Stab Your Fuckin Eye"
Maybe I like eatin shit like Tylenol P.M.s
Cuz 5 or 6'll get you high
Maybe I like punchin people I don't even know
I knock 'em flat up fuckin out (PAHH!)
Tuck some money in they jacked with a note that simply reads
"I had to let some anger out" (Sorry)
Maybe I only hang with weirdos, and hoodlums, and junkies
I keep 'em by my side
Maybe mama doesn't understand a friend is hard to comeby
SO I keep what I find
Maybe I got 2 felonies, tattoos on my neck
And I always pain't my face
Can I still date your daughter I mean I think I outta
I like the way she taste

(Chorus) 2x
Ain't YO Bidness, how I act
Ain't yo bidness, don't get slapped
Ain't yo concern, what we do
Less you want yo, face slapped too

(Violent J)
Maybe I don't' even like you but I gotta front
Cuz your a record label guy (Mother fucker)
What if I dragged you by the hair into the street
And beat your ass, put a boot up in your eye (PUH! BItch)
Maybe I would rather fuck a Missy Elliot
Before a Toni... "Braxton"
Maybe I would rather fuck a Macy Grey
Before a Janet... "Jackson"
Maybe I don't' have no self esteem
SO I like to pick on everybody else
Maybe when I was a boy, underneath my shirt
I had bruises and welts "Oh" (It's OK)
Maybe I was hungry, bottom barrel poor
And my mom was always sick
Maybe I'm lyin, I'm just tryna find and excuse to be a dick
I'm a dick-dick
Maybe i'm upset that you left me
I'll hang myself right above your bed (YOu Should Try Suicide)
From the ceiling fan, so i'll be swingin when you walk
I, I might kick you in the head
Maybe I got 7 therapists, I been committed
But my manager got me free (Double A Y'all)
18 Pills a day, I get so dizzy and high
Sometimes I can't even see (I gotta sit down)

(Chorus)

Come through ya town, put it down like a parade
See I come from Detroit and it's all about Dylan
When I Black Jack five dollas stacked to the ceiling
In my V12 'Boomin' Words' straight from Hell
Blaze green all day, tell me what do ya smell
Bump the beat up in city heat, double-oh-7
East side I ride, AK-47
You can get a lap dance for less than 20 dollas
Playas in my city known for poppin' they collas
The styles that you runnin' 'round wit' is ours
You and them 'Shady' suckas is nothin' but cowards
Bang ya brains in the dirt, make ya go bezerk
If you rap wit' Emily, your ass gon' get murk
I'm the E to the S to the H-A-M
If I wasn't then why would I say I am
Pull a jack, sell a sack 'cuz the babies need similac
You remember that rollin' in a Cadillac
You wanna' battle rap, I swing the battle axe
Chop ya head off until Hailey go tattle that (da-da)

(Chorus)

[Heather Hunter]
All night everyday you can have it ya way
I gotta clock my pay from Detroit to LA
Ok, it's Heather Hunter not the 'Number 1 Stunna'
In the Collady Fair, fast as the Road Runna
The bitches they speak about, the freak of the week no doubt
Ya man was late for dinner 'cuz he was eatin' me out
I get it on like that 'cuz I was born like that
Ya man jacked off to my porn in fact
'Cuz it's too hard to mack me
I be 'Cummin' on America' 'Action and Jack me'
Cream on, Heather Hunter, twice as nice
Screw the right thing and watch the ice bling
So tell me how you want it, push or pull
2Pac was ridin' me on a mechanical bull
It's all I think about, when I be puffin' on a blunt
Plus I give head like a Shaolin Monk

(Chorus)

[Kool Keith]
I used to pick up a pan
My friend keep a CD in the van
People to win you can
NATAS back now, suckas don't slack now
No time to act now, me on the East Side
Rollin' the E ride, girls can come slide
Into the dark room, emotional heart room
Bass can bang-boom, X and mushrooms
Hotels paid for, freakin' in all the rooms
Girls, booties get live tonight, spread the lap dance
Y'all get high tonight, ladies in love
On my jock, and cry tonight, suckas say 'Why tonight'
Pick up the hotline, baby, you think ya fine
I'll putcha first if ya wanna be the girl of mine
Wine and dine, puffin' chronic, crime
Move ya curse, grab ya purse
Me and E shootin' fireworks
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-fireworks

(Chorus)

[Heather Hunter Talking/Moaning][Intro:]
Yeah woke up on the wrong side of the bed
With all these voices in my head
One of them said

[Hook]
It feels like I'm taking steps closer to my death
Today I just might have inhaled my last breath
What was I think smoking wet in cigarettes
The only explaination is
I'm trying to kill myself
It feels like I'm taking steps closer to my death
Today I just might have inhaled my last breath
What was I think smoking wet in cigarettes
The only explaination is
I'm trying to kill myself

[Verse 1]
Cahin blunt smoking my thrid eye open
Would fly back to heaven but one of my wings broken
Hoping God forgive me holla if somebody here me
Only send my blessings when the demons ain't near me
October 30th must be devil's night
So turn down my mic and make sure my level's right
The suicidal note I write, I recite they mind
They trying to stop me from living life with all they might
I spit that potent pass it, I make too many classics
Plus I'm the poison for all you fucking rat bastards
So follow me into a suicidal flow
Spit it suicidal just like this
Suicidalist

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I lay thee down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
Please lord for heaven's sake let me just get that cake
If not then give me the ingediants and I'mma bake
I can make the earthquake I can make the Earth shake
Done him in the worst way killed him on his birthday
The more I drink the more I think I'm heading for cremation
But if I blink I just might be in a bloody situation
I lived a hard life in the fast lane, hard pains
Winning big money from the devil in the dice games
Everything on the line playing with my life man
You win you live, you lose you die
It's kinda frightning

[Hook][Intro]
Uh, yo..
A thug changes, and love changes
And best friends become strangers
A thug changes, and love changes
Yo, uh..

[Verse 1]
Can it be, that I stayed away for too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Baby ain't no need to pretend I ain't actin' live
I'm like a young ass Michael from the Jackson Five
HEE HEE! But you don't feel me
The industry for years been tryin' to kill me
Me, and my niggas stay in the cracks like roaches
Always runnin' from the raids when the cops approach us
Man my style is just too ferocious
Been spittin' potent dope for years, that's why I overdoses
Now I'm gonna tell you how it all began
Before Eminem, before all of them
I'mma tell you how they tried to play me
How my city betrayed me, made me fuckin' go crazy
Made me carry the AK in the back with my bay-bays
Yeah..

[Hook]
This world's so cold, I'mma let you know
You can't get away with tryin' to steal my flow

[Verse 2]
In '88, I set up shop before Detroit had shock
Kid Rock never rode a bike down my block
Remember Homey The Clown?
And that's about the time ICP put it down
Detroit's most wanted, K-Ice and Maistro and Smiley
I was at the Disk, spendin' bank with Gregg Riley
Even though we was movin' units every day
Still gots no love or radio play
Maybe because I won't pay payola
Known in the streets for movin' yoca cola
Me and my brother, tryin' to get up out the ghetto
Take care of my mother, cause I love her
It was no Hip-Hop Shops or freestyle battles
Only a city full of snakes that rattle
Remember, sugar is sugar and salt is salt
If they didn't sell records, it's not my fault
I used to watch the scene with Natt Morris
I dedicate this to Detroit, now I'mma sing the chorus

[Hook]
So high, you can't get over it
So high, you can't get over it
So low, that's why I'm holding it
So low, that's why I'm holding it

[Verse 3]
Boss up, a real soldier learn to take orders
So his game is still pulled through in the fourth quarter
I know you can't believe that you've all been decieved
It's like a girl sayin' her hair real but it's a weave
Feminem is a style, She-Twelve is an age
She lives across 8 mile, but still can get gauged
KKKill the fetus, please believe this, word to Jesus
I got niggas with the blowoff in they freezers
Facts is facts and fiction's fiction
If you can't take the heat, stay up out the kitchen
I remember droppin' Hellter Skkkelter
Before Devil's Night, I could've burned down the Shelter
We was bumpin' Awesome Dre
Representin' Detroit way before you met Dr. Gay
All my underground niggas up at c Notes
Open mic, spittin' wicked shit that we wrote
There wasn't no East to West Coast
Just Awol, Rap Mafia, DJ Eazy B and Los

[Hook]
This world's so cold, I'mma let you know
You can't get away with tryin' to steal my flow[VERSE 1]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
A suicidal brother must take a fall
Can I talk for a second to myself
Can I talk for a second to myself
Can I look into my eyes, for a second
Take a second look into my eyes
I'm not surprised at what I see
I see you staring right back at me
So I'm going to take a chance
Take a razor to my wrist
Take a rest
Take me a razor from the medicine chest
But I hesitate to take myself out my misery
I got to get my head together
Or whatever
I'm going to do
I've got to do it right now
Cause I'm a Suicidalist and I know how
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money
So "Elizabeth, I'm coming to join you honey"
Can I get Wicket
Get Wicket, can I get
I'm losing my mind
I can't take this shit
I think I'm going to do it
Going to do it man I think
I bet by tomorrow dead bodies might stink
13 Ways how to do it man I know
But if I got to go, I guess I got to go
I'm still dreaming about death
And every day is like dead
I got a screw loose and a hole in my head
Tick-tock and you don't stop
Fuck the motherfucking cops
Man, I'm thinking all this crazy shit
I grip my dick
Damn...

[SEGUE TO NEXT TRACK]Shaggy...

Slappin ninjas on their hiding spots

Take my hand bitch, come along, it ain't that far
Welcome to the Bizzar!

I say all the institutions have failed us
The Church has failed
The School has failed
The Government has failed
The Home has failed

(TNT)
Up early Sunday morning
(MASTAMIND)
I'm about to do some dirt
(ESHAM)
My Bible's kind of bloody
Shotgun put in work
(MASTAMIND)
I heard my heater talking to me
He was talking to me saying, "Blaz4me"
(ESHAM)
And my mad mind flipped kind of drastically
(TNT)
Buck, buck, buck goes the shells
(MASTAMIND)
That's quicker than you can tell
(ESHAM)
I'm sending a nigga to Hell
(TNT)
Don't say shit when I blast on your dome
(MASTAMIND)
Cause my nickel plated chrome got a mind of its own
(ESHAM)
He wants me to wet them, so I let him
Talk me into putting them slugs right in you
(TNT)
Damn, I'm talking to the gun in my hand
He wants me to understand
(ALL)
My shotgun said, "Blaz4me"

[HOOK]
I'm going to fuck this whole town up
Blaz4me
I'm going to fuck this whole town up
My shotgun said,  "Blaz4me"
I'm going to fuck this whole town up
Blaz4me
I'm going to fuck this whole town up

[VERSE 2:  ALL]
(ESHAM)
Now I'm running down the street with a gun in my hand
My shotgun said, "Can we murder a man?"
(MASTAMIND)
I hear voices in my head telling me to do things
Once I see a cop then I start the shooting
(ESHAM)
It's routine
Every day I hear shots in my ear
I wish they'd go and just disappear
(TNT)
I see the blood squirting
As I do my dirt and
Niggas getting killed so you better call it curtains
(MASTAMIND)
A bloody mess
I'm going out my mind, I find
Myself talking to my shotgun all the time
(TNT)
It's kind of crazy but the more I stop and think
(ESHAM)
Hey yo it's time to get my dick out the sink
My shotgun said, "Blaz4me"

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3:  ALL]
(MASTAMIND)
My shotgun said, "Blaz4me"
So I blast, right
(TNT)
It's the middle of the night
I feel a lot of hype
(MASTAMIND)
I had a dream
I had a bad dream, now it's real
(ESHAM)
It said, "Wake up, motherfucker and pass me the steel"
(MASTAMIND)
Let me peel
Thou shalt not kill, but I'm ill
(TNT)
Cops on my heels, got me running through the 'ville
(MASTAMIND)
They got a gun to my head, then my gun said
(ESHAM)
"Blast quick, or get your ass kicked 'til you're dead"
(MASTAMIND)
Yo, bet your ass
I'll be blastin' that ass like an assassin
(TNT)
[?] 'em off the Earth in a devilish fashion
(MASTAMIND)
I don't give a fuck, so you better duck
When you're coming at me
(ESHAM)
Peel 'em back, G
(MASTAMIND)
My shotgun said, "Blaz4me"

(Paper....Gotta have that Paper...)
(Paper....Gotta have that Paper...)
(Paper....)

[Verse 1]
Gotta get that feddy cuz I need it, that's why I stay heated
Jesus save me, throw me down a bundle
Wrapped up like a football, bet I won't fumble
Stumble, I'm lying in the jungle, serving my "Bo-Jumbles"
A killer where my gun blows, but I stay humble
Watch 'em all crumble, "Baller" like "Motumbo"
Riding with a bumble, beats causing rumble
Hoes try to beat a nigga like a bongo
Mixerman cook 'em in a pot like gumbo
Specially when your pesos coming so pronto

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gotta get some purple is what I'm smoking, that' why I stay choking, locc'n
English broken, all this papers got me open
Get more papers all I'm hoping
No need to say a word to papers, spoken
Freezer frozen when I'm posing
Passion, cameras, flashing lights and action main attraction
Paper make everything better best believe it, and I love to receive it
Billionaire baller status, the chief is still breathing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Gotta have that mucho de nero, and when I got it its to querdo
Errday, allday, baby girl what you say I can't stay
We can play I don't pay, keep me right around the way
We can ride around the today, AaaaYo. HeeeyHo
Wake up get ya cake up...bake up
Only thing that matters in this life is paper, everybody got they own price for paper
Chips with the dip grims when ya get more paper then ya even know what to do with
So let me get right to it

[Hook]

[Outo: Kid Talking]
Dadda we gotta get all the paper
That's right
So we can have that lure jet
And we can be on MTV Cribs with the mansion and the swimming pool
This Lil' Tey Tey representDetroit listeners out there
You'd better be sure to stop by at the Galaxy Club
Where there's a freestyle, super fresh contest going on tonight
If you got the skills you better get yout hip-hop ass on down here
We got DJ Clueless on the wheels of steel

[Esham]
Mortification is my next demonstration
I'd ask you for a lite pumpin' gas at the station
Here's my situtation
I hate many people
So I hear no see no say no evil
Just like Knieval
Leave you headless bloody mess
Like you was ridin' a Ducati
Ladidadi broke every bone in your body I'm not sorry
I'd probely murder you
Voices tellin' me do what he say
Kill a DJ
Fuck what he play
Mayday Mayday
BOOM! BOOM!
Blood's all over the room
I fucked yo bitch
Like a witch with a broom
Doom's
Day
Murderers say
All y'all must pay when the buckshot's spray
Who wants the challenge me
Grab the mic and bust yo raps
But then I'm just gonna grab my strap
And just commence to bustin' caps
Leaving bodies piled up
In freestyle clubs(fuck)
You better make room
BOOM like what

[Hook: repeat 2X]
WHAT! y'all make room!
When we show up
BOOM BOOM BOOM
WHAT!

[Violent J]
Killaz run up in this bitch
Start bustin' off shots
Hittin literballs, lazer lights and people on the top
I'm looking for the dj
Cuz he don't see it my way
I'm bout 2 blow 'em out his head
?????? some A.B.K
I'm like a molitov cocktail
Breakin' on your wall
I'm setting shit off
I blow your lid off
Your body falls
You don't need aluminoliam
Leavin' blood everywhere
And I'm aiming for the head n hair of everybody their
I'm like a grasshopper
Quick to jump I'm spreading my wings
You say the wicked shit will die
I say you faggots seeing things
And all you bitches know I'm gangsta
Don't ask me to dance
I might straight panic pull the gat
And blow your pussy out your pants
It's the wicked shit It's E n J
It's hotter than Hell
And every Devil's Night we hunt them down
And slaughter D-12
I take the moosegun and shut your blood and blow it out your back
Turning face to camera
Where your hatchets at
Throw 'em up y'all

[Hook]

[Esham]
Make room
Guess who comin in
Grab my gun again
They told me he was one of them
So I done him in
A killers on the hunt again
Smoke my blunt again
Fatality finished him I win again
Repentance my vengance
So I'm not sentanced a hundred years
It's burning my ears and blood is mixed with my tears fears
My styles get rid of theres
Drive-bys in wheelchairs
All you see is smoke in the air
Cuz we don't care

[Hook]Esham - BOSS UP lyrics

Hook:
Boss up
Don't get me crossed up
We like to drink the sauce up
Toss money at the bar and floss up
Boss up
Y'all know who's the nicest
I'm from Detroit, player
I don't care what the price is

Verse 1:
I don't wear Nike Air force ones no more, baby, I'm sorry
My sneakers cost nine hundred dollars and they made by Maury
My shit's ridiculous, got gold in my toilet stool
And bitches wanna swim with diamonds in my swimming pool
"He's so cool!"
When the girls see me, they all drool
Because they know that I'm the one that's breaking all the rules
My mink coat's so long, you can mistake it for carpet
You got purple kush up in that blunt, homie? Just spark it
If twenty-six's ain't on your truck, you should just park it
Because you're out there like that department store, Target
I bought the Beatles catalog back from Michael Jackson
Then called his ass a child-molester right before I slapped him
Then sold the shit to Paul McCartney, then I double-taxed him
The chrome Desert Eagle convinced him - and relaxed him
Christina Aguilara came over, did me dirty
I told Beyonce stop trying to give me Jay z's birdy
I know you purdy, but go get me an ice-cold Pepsi
Then get your ass in this hot tub with me and Lisa Marie Presley
Hook:
Boss up
Don't get me crossed up
We like to drink the sauce up
Toss money at the bar and floss up
Boss up
Y'all know who's the nicest
I'm from Detroit, player
I don't care what the price is

Verse 2:
I walk on rose petals, my feet never touch the ground
Got two bitches - one to wipe me up, one to wipe me down
I sleep with three women all night, it's like a hardcore porn
They got me shaking in my bed like Ozzy Osbourne
I got the power
I'm pissing golden showers
The ho that wipe my ass say it smells like flowers
Is that necessary? Me and Hallie Barry in a bubble bath
Just got back from Germany, I'm jet lag

Hook:
Boss up
Don't get me crossed up
We like to drink the sauce up
Toss money at the bar and floss up
Boss up
Y'all know who's the nicest
I'm from Detroit, player
I don't care what the price is

Verce 3:
I got four hundred acres in the city on the East side
Police, they work for me, deliver donuts and pizza
I pay Maria Carry to come and sit on my toilet and sing to me
When I'm in the tub, and dry my booty when I'm done
I got three helicopters and I rent them out for videos
So rappers can front and try to boss up like me, I suppose
I got a pit with platinum slugs and a doghouse, with an escalator in it
You's a hater, admit it
I did it, I made it
You hate it, can't fade it
Murdered a bitch with my bare hands and only got a fine and paid it
Bought the jury each a bently, after the trial I took it back
Here I come! Look at that! Where my fucking hookers at?
Had a private jet, but I sold it to the Soviets
As boss as it gets, for real and flossing all hits
I'm underground, undetected, much respected
Never rejected, my downfall - don't expect it

Hook:
Boss up
Don't get me crossed up
We like to drink the sauce up
Toss money at the bar and floss up
Boss up
Y'all know who's the nicest
I'm from Detroit, player
I don't care what the price is[Mastamind]
Uh Uh, Oh, Whassup
It came to this now huh?
We gotta cut mothafuckas like this now right?
Uh uh, what? what? hey yo hey yo hey yo

[Mastamind]
Everytime I come around niggas look at me up and down
What the fuck now? Do I gotta get buckwild?
My stress is at its all time high
I'm just not impressed, with softees actin hard I gives a fuck less
Do I gotta open his head up somethin surgical
Take em vertical, never tatum while the verse is full
Oh no! We gotta bleeda, bitch meet the reaper
The devil ain't got no love for you, me neither
You don't want a nigga like me to see ya, keep a heata
The way my demons want you dead wouldn't wanna be ya
Joke's up, the G loc's up, so what shut up
We gon' see how tough you be when we roll up
Talkin more shit that a critic would til we visit his hood
Break his limbs chop him down, split his wood
Time out, get him out the game anyway
Fuck what anybody say, I can live with the fame
I came to master the game and dish out pain
You can't weather the storm get out the rain
All my killaz chant, die die
Dat all my killaz in the van, bout the murda ride
And strive, when we collide ya better be somewhere inside
Keep screamin fo yo life can't look a demon in the eye

[Esham]
You, you, you too light in the ass to try to step in the ring with a heavy weight
I'm bout to kill you, I give you a shot at the title but you must be suicidal
Who's ya idol punk? Who's ya idol? You wanna piece a this?
You can't handle this scandulous shit
Brain surgery you better murder me I need some therapy
For those who never hearda me you need a lombotamy
Gotta be in ya head like purgery, purgatory
Concocted the evil rhyme inside the laboratory
Pimped Boomin Words From Hell way before D-12
Tell me your favorite white rapper act like a female
Bitch, slit ya wrist like ya dumb wife, Kim
Scribble my name on the wall, I love E-S-H-A-M
Choke a psychiatrist, choke the mic in my fist
Chokin off the bomb smoke his therapy says my therapist
I sniffed through much 'cane, wanna kill too many people
So I hafta hear no, see no, say no motherfuckin evil
Brain surgery open ya head up wake the dead up
Never let up till ya wet up when ya fall down never get up
Brain surgery open ya head up wake the dead up
Never let up till ya wet up when ya fall down never get up

[Shoestring]
Come peep my skills and operation
Stick it in yo brain, a mental patient
Lookin in yo mind, bitch you still cryin
Open up yo head and hit that line
I tap them nerves and it makes you wiggle
I kill more brains than Dr. Giggles
So call us up if its urgent
Dr. Kill Kill, yo fuckin brain surgeon
Dr. Kill Kill, yo fuckin brain surgeon
Dr. Kill Kill, yo fuckin brain surgeon[Hook]

I only see you in my dreams then I get this feeling again
And every time I close my eyes it starts all over again

[Verse 1]

I wake up
Go to sleep back out on the streets
I live in my car I can’t go far
You thinking I’m a star
Homeless phoneless a dog out here boneless
Foreclosed on my home man I thought I owned this
Reality is I’m just a slave lock me up if I misbahave
Want financial freedom
Niggas look at us like we dumb
I lost my job I lost my kids I lost my wife and the crib
Everybody wondering what we did
But I ain’t do dick this life’s just a bitch
The world just a toilet and it’s full of shit
Going round and round
Fuck the police coming straight from the underground
Bang was the gat sound
You need to slow down

[Hook]

I only see you in my dreams then I get this feeling again
And every time I close my eyes it starts all over again

[Verse 2]

I dream about my house on the beach instead I’m living on the streets
I sure is hungry my stomach growling I need something to eat
I need something to eat, I’m hungry
I’m skinny and bony, I’m lonely
I wish somebody would just give me a coney
No mustard and onions
Can I get some extra cheese please?
Can I get some extra cheese?
Can I get some extra cheese please?
Chilli cheese on chlli cheese and a large chilli fry to go

[Hook]

I only see you in my dreams then I get this feeling again
And every time I close my eyes it starts all over againYou don't know me I'm the unholy soley time patrolly
I clock crazy credits and don't rhyme for rollies
Still bustin at the police know least one of my bullets
Will hit my enemy in his face when this trigger, I pull it
I'm twisted like a psychopath, I write my rhymes in blood
I don't got a DJ cause I a-cut him up
They won't let me on MTV I'd beat up Carson Daly
And remind Eminem of DiAngelo Bailey
Hailie's in a coma, Hailie's in a coma
I smell the aroma, of a dead body
Chemi-cal imbalance Chemi-cal imbalance
Chemi-cal imbalance Chemi-cal imbalance
Drugs, thugs, slugs, niggas get plugged
At a early age up in Detroit, nigga what?!
Hustla, get yo trick on
Ho, tell em who dick you want
Shit! I'mma lunatic in this bitch
I wanna blow my own head off, Kurt Cobain style
I think if I was dead I'd be better off now
Chemi-cal imbalance Chemi-cal imbalance
Chemi-cal imbalance Chemi-cal imbalance[Answering machine]
(beep) Then you know what you can do
You can be a couple of pleasers
And take some tweazers
And bust every hair on my nutsack
Paste em to your back
Then jump on the E-Track
And suck my dick exactly where it's at....HO
(beep)

[Old record plays]
Jay fuzz the clown

[Low bass starts in background]

[Verse 1-Violent J] (crowd in parentheses)
Hey, Hey it's the wicked jokers
And we're coming to the valley and we'll smoke ya (choke ya)
Kick the clown in the forehead and I'm juggling juggling your head
(Jed) You big fat redneck mounty ass hick
I'm a city slicker and I'm come to the valley and I'm gonna hit ya
And ya know the carnival's gonna get wit' ya
Oh, I meant as well mention, that I come from another di-men-sion
You never seen nothing like this boy (Magic acts of pain and joy)
Please don't try to come and get me
Because I pack a French curler with me
And them punks are gonna have to take me out quick
Because I can do a double-flip you fat piece of shit
Picture that (that) packing a magic wand and a top hat
Because some gotta stop or the wicked clowns are gonna chop, chop

[Hook]
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop [X2]

[Verse 2-Violent J]
Detroit air is toxic, my eyeballs popped out they sockets
And fried in the streets like a sick em
[Sound of popping and a splatter]
(stick em, pick em)
Break em off something from the smokestack
I've been breathing all my life so I'm dying anyway
I'm nothing but a radiation freak show
My arm fell of and it bounced on the floor
Carnival land up the alley (alley, alley)
Then we landed in Sunny Valley
(Jumpin up and down on a richies head)
And now I'm gonna jump till he's finally dead
(Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump)
They got no love yet we got control
They'll never touch my funky soul
Street top all extra top
Now we can run or we can walk
Either way some gotta stop
Or the wicked clowns are gonna chop, chop

[Hook]

[Verse 3-Esham and Violent J]

[Esham] Wicked Clown, Wicked Clown
[Violent J] What's up comes down
[Esham] Before my nuts go soft juggle em around
[Violent J] Bitch wanna join the carnival circus
Grab my ding-a-ling and jerk and jerkus
[Esham] I gotta catch these carnival thrills rudeboy (*mixed*)
New born babies heads I drill
[Violent J] Chills, thrills, bigots writing wills
An axe to the forehead usually kills
[Esham]
If this ain't hell, I can't tell, hang my body on a cross with some
Rusty nails
If I juggle then call me a juggla, I'm a nap rubbla, voodoo smuggla
See I got the symptoms of insanity, I'm down with J from the ICP
I'm down with him and he's down with me
So if we gotta chop see H-O-PE

[Violent J]
Running down the block someone hit me wit' a rock
And my brains all over the street
But I'm a wicked clown and I'm up and down all over this Esham beat

[Esham]
So, so, so if I gotta chop, then I guess I gotta chop
If I chop, then I gotta chop, chop

[Both]
But you could never stop sucker, you could never drop
Wicked clowns cause you know we love to CHOP, CHOP

[Hook] (x2)

Got to be funky

[Hook]
All the muthafuckin' drugs in the world can't heal these sick little boys and girls
X4

[Verse 1]
Vicodin, Codeine, Dimethyltryptamine
At the Methadone clinic trying to get some Morphine
Crack fiend, Caffeine, trying to stay clean
Making false promises to Narcotics Anonymous
Get so schizo, doctors get rich, yo
Off mental illness
Writing prescriptions
There's no solution then
For these hallucinogens
Just a hooligan rockin' to Max Julien

We all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine

Propofol, Demerol
Man they want to kill us all
Just like Michael Jackson, and get us off the wall

Chemical imbalance, eat your molecules
Forensics, drug tests, and hair follicles

Get it in, Ritalin, tell me what he did again
Oh no, he on that crazy shit again

Pill, pill, pillin' him
You know they killin' him

That's why they just keep refillin' him

[Hook]
All the muthafuckin' drugs in the world can't heal these sick little boys and girls
X4

[Outro]
Life is not a video game
You can't push reset
When you get killed in real life you die
And it ain't no comin' back
