[Hook: All]
Back to the grill again, the grill again
(Repeat x6)

[Verse 1: MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the car, parked it
Big fat blunts, if you got it then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the 70's and brothers got on grins
Cause they can step to some sisters and say "Slap me some skins
"Honeydip," and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the grill

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewing
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what did you know
SO many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like sasquatch (Not!)
And George Bush gets enough props
Well, anyway, I'mma slay slay lay
Pull a ho around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me a part of history
Kicking em in the grill

[Verse 3: Nas]
Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhoea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that y'all) That y'all, kick em in the grill

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks ?ya naughty? fakes, steady rate h
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of "The Dialect, The Derelict"
The murder licks, Vanilla kicks alive on the crucifix
Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell more record bums
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're humming
The door rings, yo I'm coming
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guiness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gewn to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious
Rapper dapper snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill

[Hook]

[Verse 5: MC Serch]
So here's a true and false, tell me if it's factable
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G I'll put you in a tree like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a bar called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but gave it back cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say "Yeah I fucked your moms"
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill

OneAdapted from a chapter in the Jay-Z biography EMPIRE STATE OF MIND: HOW JAY-Z WENT FROM STREET CORNER TO CORNER OFFICE. Published by Portfolio/Penguin. Copyright (c) Zack O'Malley Greenburg, 2012.

“That deal was the most fucked-up deal that I’ve ever seen or heard of,” says Michael Berrin, better known as MC Serch of 3rd Bass, with an intensity that makes me think he’s about leap out of my phone and into my office. “I came to Jay-Z with the automobile industry in my back pocket to do a Shawn Carter edition vehicle that he approved, only to have the automobile industry basically shoot it down for fear that he was a bigger star than the car.”

Just as he’s about to explain what happened, Serch is interrupted by the blare of a cell phone (the ringtone, fittingly, is Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind”). When I press him for more details about the vehicle, he tells me that it was going to be a “Jay-Z Jeep” painted “Jay-Z Blue.” Then he starts to say something else, but stops short.

“That’s really a Marques McCammon question,” he says. “I haven’t spoken to Marques in a long time.”

***

Jay-Z’s ability to make money by attaching his name to products is one of his greatest strengths as a businessman, and it’s especially important given the ever-declining numbers in the record industry. In 2012, the year after Empire State of Mind went to press, he pulled in $38 million—less than one quarter of which came from album sales. Over the past few years, Jay-Z has shilled for Reebok, Hewlett-Packard, and Budweiser; in the wake of my chat with Serch, it was clear that Jeep was slated to join that list until something went wrong.

Finding out what happened to the Jay-Z Jeep starts with Jay-Z Blue, a color dreamed up by Jay-Z and marketing guru Steve Stoute. A decade ago, they approached industrial designer Adrian Van Anz with the idea of creating a shade to trademark as Jay-Z’s own. Van Anz, creator of the vodka-cooled computer and jewel-encrusted iPod, happily obliged by creating a reflective, silvery medium-blue color with a dash of platinum dust. “Gave it a little bit of my personality,” Jay-Z reportedly joked. “I’m known for platinum.”

“Jay-Z Blue is a license for corporations to get Jay-Z in the building,” Stoute told Rolling Stone in 2005. “Cars, laptops, lots of different things. I got deals lined up like you don’t understand.”

The Jay-Z Jeep seemed to be the car in question. But after three months of pestering industry sources and trying to reach Marcus McCammon, I wasn’t getting anywhere. And so, on a sunny spring day, I found myself at the front desk of a nondescript office building in San Diego, paying a surprise visit to my last hope for clarity on the Jay-Z Jeep.

“I’m here to see Marques McCammon,” I tell the receptionist brightly.

“Is he expecting you?”

“Well, no.”

Five minutes later, a stocky man in his late thirties ambles in and introduces himself as Marques McCammon.

“The skinny,” he says, “is this.”

He lowers himself into a seat across the table from me.

“I was in the process of having some discussions with Jeep … They were trying to skew a little bit younger, they were getting ready to launch the Jeep Commander, the first seven-passenger Jeep to hit their portfolio. It was supposed to be the granddaddy of the Jeeps, the most luxurious.”

McCammon’s first conversations with Jeep and parent Chrysler took place in late 2004, as part of his job at American Specialty Cars, a company often hired by Detroit automakers to make quirky-looking models like the throwback pickup Chevy SSR.

Hoping to secure a contract from Chrysler to produce a souped-up version of the Jeep Commander, McCammon asked the well-connected Serch what it would take to get Jay-Z to lend his name to the vehicle. “Serch was like, ‘Yeah, it’s gotta be the top of the line, it has to be the best of the best,’” McCammon recalls.

McCammon took the idea back to the executives at Mopar (short for “Motor Parts”), the automobile parts and services arm of Chrysler. With their blessing, he would have Serch reach out to Jay-Z and start the process of agreeing on terms and picking specs for the vehicle. But getting approval from the Chrysler brass proved to be tougher than McCammon had anticipated. “I probably went to four different executive-level meetings with directors and VPs inside of marketing at Chrysler,” he says. “I spent most of the time just trying to break down the stereotypes or the misconceptions of Jay’s evolution as a person.”

McCammon persisted, arguing that a Jay-Z Jeep would be the best way to rejuvenate the brand’s image. By the beginning of 2005, he’d prevailed upon Chrysler’s executives and Serch had convinced Jay-Z’s camp to take a meeting in Detroit. The duo started brainstorming the vehicle’s specs: butter-cream leather seats, twenty-two-inch chrome wheels, and a digital entertainment system preloaded with all of Jay-Z’s songs. The color? Jay-Z Blue.

According to McCammon, negotiations for Jay-Z’s up-front fee were to start at $1 million, plus up to 5 percent of every Jay-Z Jeep sold. With its impressive list of specs, the vehicle would have retailed for about $50,000, in the neighborhood of what a normal Jeep Commander would cost with all options included. The initial run of one thousand vehicles was projected to earn Jay-Z $2,500,000 in total—and exponentially more if it enjoyed the mainstream success that McCammon and Serch expected—all for simply lending his name to what was, quite literally, a cross-promotional vehicle. Says Serch: “It would have been a home run.”

The week before Jay-Z was set to fly to Detroit to seal the deal, McCammon called Chrysler to confirm. But in the days after McCammon convinced the company’s executives of Jay-Z’s legitimacy, there had been a reshuffling of management. The new boss didn’t want anything to do with Jay-Z, a former drug dealer, despite appeals from McCammon.

“We kind of got brushed off,” McCammon recounts. Serch puts it less diplomatically. “The automobile business is run by elitist white men who are very scared of losing their power, who would rather see the whole thing crumble and fall apart than to give up their power.”

***

In January of 2007, just two years after the collapse of the Jay-Z Jeep deal, General Motors hosted a gaudy gala on the eve of the North American International Auto Show in a gigantic tent on the shores of the Detroit River. A procession of celebrities, including Carmen Electra and Christian Slater, escorted new vehicles down a brightly lit runway. But the star of the show was the man who emerged from a GMC Yukon—none other than Jay-Z—who received a seven-figure check for his efforts.

Like its conceptual predecessor, the Jay-Z Blue Yukon never made it to the streets. But that doesn’t mean Jay-Z’s dealings with Detroit were a failure. Yes, Chrysler backed out of the Jeep deal, and GM never planned to actually sell a Jay-Z-branded vehicle. But in the end, Jay-Z was paid a heap of money to simply walk out of an automobile.

Perhaps by that point, he’d decided there wasn’t a future for Jay-Z Blue anyway, and the Yukon deal was the best he could get. As Warren Buffett has said, “Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.”

Jay-Z was wise not to spend too much time on the latter.

This episode, we talk the best of old-school NYC life and hip-hop with two folks who know it better than almost anybody.  MC Serch is best known for his work with 3rd Bass, but has also executive produced classic albums (including a little one called Illmatic), hosted TV shows, and more

Blake "KEO" Lethem is a true hip-hop Renaissance man.  From being an influential graffiti artist to arguably the first white rapper to designing album covers for the likes of MF DOOM, Blake has seen and done it all, and shares much of it with us here.  We talk nightlife, stardom, graffiti's TRUE relationship to hip-hop, and that time Hammer put out a hit on 3rd Bass.

What I've showed you now three different times, on this stage, is when they approach you - BANG, zero to sixty

Danielle's Mom: And see thing is we never approached him he always approached us

David: No, no, no I'm sick and tired. I'm tired, I'm tired, okay? (We all have!) I've been through hell, I've been through back

Alesha: We all have

Serch: No, let him talk, no

David: Let me talk, I've been through hell, I've been through back, I'm trying to see my kids regardless, the money I make all goes to my kids, I've been homeless, I've been homeless with my daughter, I have been sleeping in tents, I have not had a real home and the reason why I have to jump in jobs is because I can't concentrate when I'm constantly worrying about my kids

Alesha's Mom: Start wearing a rubber!

David: See what I mean? The fu... what's that supposed to mean!?

[Chatter]

Serch: Listen to me, that's not helping. What you just said isn't helping

David: It's like this, real talk. I don't care what anybody says, what matter at the end is my kids. What I'm angry about is that I don't see my kids and I've done everything I can, I've been jumping cities because I'm trying to find the best route to go, I'm going in college, I just got my Phlebotomy certificate. I have 2 weeks of college left. McDonald's flippin' burgers ain't cutting it, because you take 243 dollar check, granted that's going to go to my kids how am I supposed to have a home myself and be able to to support the one I have myself at home, granted I'm worrying about kids in different place but what about the one that is at my house!

Serch: David listen to me, you're dealing with a lot of conflict and a lot of pain , and it's hard to learn to be a man when you don't have a man in your life. So you have a lot of misconception about what being a man is and I feel you, I feel your pain, and I understand, and all I'm trying to say to you is that if you really want to move forward the change that has to be made is how you communicate. I'm going to help you outside of the show, I'm gonna get you counseling, anger management counseling, I'm gonna put you in charge of big brothers, I'm gonna get you a mentor program, what you're not learning is that the love for your children can't be manifested in your anger towards your baby mamas

Danielle's mom: Work on gettin' himself better

Serch: And you have to stop provoking him

Danielle: We don't do anything

Serch: And I respect that, I'm not talking about that

Danielle: No! It's the fact that okay maybe if he got more responsible and was a better person and not cuss me up and down. Maybe then and when he could prove himself to be a better man, then he could see my son.

Serch: Okay but here's the thing, you saying that to him, here...

Danielle: No that shouldn't make him -- I've told him! I don't know how many times, I can't tell you how many times I've told him this

Serch: But here's the thing, you are provoking this

Danielle: No! I'm trying to tell him - look...

Serch: NO! You've told him, I've heard it, you've said it a hundred times, I heard you!

David: And I'm tried of hearing it

Danielle: And I'm not tired of you running up and down cussing me and threatening to take me to court?

Serch: So listen to me, doing a favour, David, we're gonna move forward right now.I want you to look at your baby mommas and say "I will never cuss you out again"

David: I'll never cuss y'all out again


[Audience applause][MC Serch]
Once again, this is your brain
This is your brain on drugs *egg starts frying*
This is your brain on social narcotics
Any questions?

Do you sell drugs (No) Do you carry drugs? (Never did)
But you ain't talking about the drugs inserted in the crib
Of the mind of the youth, young and trying to adapt
To the circles and hurdles and the craps, it's on map
Get the backslap and the "Everything's all right" lecture
Then in school BAM! sit 'em right next to
Mister David Duke, triple K white Aryan
Who tells you pops told him that you were the lesser man
Because of drugs that were put into the books
By the crooks of culture, the truth has a mother's looks
Who blesses and loves every single day
Words from Papa triple K and 66 right way
Take the troops here Mr. "Only Way to Stop It"
I ain't checking for the crack, I'm worried about the social narcotics

This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)

Grumble grumble growl, toss and tumble, ow
How's he living kid (Foul!)
Spoon-feeding is deceiving because I need a fork
And if white people are superior I was delivered by the stork
Taught me that I was superior
Others are inferior, but what's important is the interior
Goddamn it, don't blame it on Janet
The nation got rhythm, but the rhythm ain't good
Not in my neighborhood
But will that change the devilish global way of thinking?
Homeboy, as fast as the eye starts blinking
But I'm just one man, one man one sister one brother one cousin
That helps another, to change change a place and change a pace
So the rats don't win the rat race
Cause every time a clock goes "tick" another falls vic
To the social narcotic

This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)

[Fatal]
Yo social narcotics, a dangerous way of life
Talk to the young which will now deal with strife
Parents teaching their kids to be racist
So they grow up tricking, show hate to some faces
The side effects get me real vexed
Seeing people trying to flex case they got a color complex
Innocent children I see stay addicted
Getting high off of hate, that's why pain stays inflicted
To another color, it's a black and white fight
In Fatal's sight, that's why I gotta enlighten
The blind minds of those that fell in this harsh reality
A social abuse that attacks the mentality
Cause race against race only brings friction
Pain and infliction, cause that's the addiction
Those that fall victim now walk around headless
Cause the drug that they took made them an addict to prejudice

This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)

[MC Serch]
This land is your land, this land is my land
From the streets of Compton to the Brooklyn island
From my people in prison to the Red Fern projects
This land was made for you and me supposedly
You never taught me true history
We killed the Indians and showed it as a victory
Original man, pilgrims saw him as a caveman
Convert to be Christian or become a slaveman
Indian brought the corn and the bread and in return
We gave 'em muskets to the head? Damn
Right back to the have-nots
Now in '92, lowered to be mascots
The Redskins, the Indians, the Atlanta Braves
What if we called the team "The Atlanta Slaves"?
Brothers would have a field day
Don't you understand now we got to turn the right way?
Cause every time a clock goes "tick" another falls vic
To the social narcotic

This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)MC Serch: There was a writer in my neighborhood, a female writer that went to Art And Design named "Too Cute". She used to get up on the C lines. She - Julie Shrenk is her real name - I used to love her black book. She had a great black book, and she'd have Lee and all these others... And I was like, you know, I need to find a name. I was a real inquisitive kid, so she was like, "Why don't you write 'Search'? You're always searching for..." And I was like "Alright, cool." So I used to write S-E-A-R-C-H Search, and then one of my birthdays, my man Kevan Moore got me a nameplate belt buckle. The difference between the 5 letter nameplate belt buckle and the 6 letter nameplate belt buckle was like $35. Crazy, mad dough. So he got me like the 5 and tried to squeeze in an "A" to the S-E-A-R-C-H and I was like "Nah, that don't look right", so I took it out and just had "Serch". That's how the "A" came out of "search"[Hook: All]
Back to the grill again, the grill again
(Repeat x6)

[Verse 1: MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the car, parked it
Big fat blunts, if you got it then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the 70's and brothers got on grins
Cause they can step to some sisters and say "Slap me some skins
"Honeydip," and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the grill

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewing
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what did you know
SO many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like sasquatch (Not!)
And George Bush gets enough props
Well, anyway, I'mma slay slay lay
Pull a ho around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me a part of history
Kicking em in the grill

[Verse 3: Nas]
Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhoea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that y'all) That y'all, kick em in the grill

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks ?ya naughty? fakes, steady rate h
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of "The Dialect, The Derelict"
The murder licks, Vanilla kicks alive on the crucifix
Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell more record bums
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're humming
The door rings, yo I'm coming
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guiness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gewn to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious
Rapper dapper snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill

[Hook]

[Verse 5: MC Serch]
So here's a true and false, tell me if it's factable
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G I'll put you in a tree like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a bar called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but gave it back cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say "Yeah I fucked your moms"
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill

[Hook]"This is probably the most challenging record
You have ever put on your turntable.."

[MC Serch]
The facts, the facts get fried like your eggs scrambled
Truth until it falls off the ledge lays dead or vexed
Tennis feds(?) need the last price, gassed ego
He don't show or know about the last nights and days
Of a brother who went for his
My land built on hatred and sent to kids
Ice Cube killed his own and it was square biz
So if I say fuck you to a jew, you know what time it is
Of my own kind but not of my own mind
Came to America but became blind
Chased from the four corners of the earth
But over here it's alright, at least your ass is white
So sit down and mingle with the devil over supper
The only difference between us and a brother is the color
Instead of hittin the last nail in the coffin try to pull it out
And find out what the hard but true is all about

[Chorus]
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
So hard.. but so true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true

[MC Serch]
Hard, what?  Truth sometimes too hard to be true
So I'ma make it stick like glue
Too many times too many crimes get backed up
Case comes up, oops!  Switch all the facts up
Three kids rape a sister at St. John's
And become graduates, instead of cons
Instead of washin drawers or be somebody's whore
College wack buffed and polished and they kept the doors closed
Jail time (yeah?) Wasn't even fazin 'em
Probably one of the fathers gave the school a gymnasium
Korean kills a girl and claims insane, and gets a pardon?
Bring her honor to the court of Nickerson Garden
And get a lifetime sentence of the bent over
Tell a fool, tell a friend and then sent over
Hollow point slugs made of nothin but lead
The hard but true is takin you straight to the head

[Chorus]

[MC Serch]
Reggie McBride, yeah..
Asalaam alaikum to a Muslim
Shalom alaikum is the same to a Hebrew
Peace akeem, akeem peace to a Zulu
Tell me what's the difference why you riffin what's the point of view?
Universal greeting is the same
The game is three-sixty it don't matter what the slang
Gangs of thugs carry slugs use the mind as a Glock 9
Wake the ones then shake the ones
Then make the ones come into the daytime
And spark the mark labelled X
And knowledge the text
Use the wit not as a whip reload the clip then shoot from the hip
Cause yo!  This is some ol' next shit
One circle, one hurdle, one jump
One nation under the groove, and then over the hump
Of racist dogs, that keep barkin in the street
Serch'll bring the hard but true to your feet, complete!

[Outro]
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but yo, it's true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
So hard.. so true
The hard but the true

Yeah Wolf & Epic, cool
Ay you, ay you ay you, ay you ay you
Ay you, it's hard but it's true
Ay you, ay you ay you ay you
It's hard but it's true, you hebrew or you jew
Your christian, your muslim, your islam, your brother, your sister
It's hard but it's true.. peaceSo y'all thought I was comin back with some old R&B huh?
Check it...

Here it, comes!
Yo, here it is or there it was
But where was it when you need it?  Because
You fall to the waistline when you waste rhymes
Serch got it flowin when it comes to fat beats and basslines
I heard the rumors and the fables
Remove them like the tumors on the tables
Boomers for the willing and the able
So turn to the next page in your manual and flim-flam, all over the jam!
Chill, Lounge
Kick your ten little toes up at the edge of this
Razor blade and save your spade
As the groove plummets you to another dimension
May I just mention
This is a map, it's for all made for climbin
And you're stuck to your grip like an aluminum sidin
Hiding in the back is for crumbs
And here it comes!

Hit it off
Kick it off
Hit it off
Here it, comes!

B-boys, decoys will try to destroy
Deploy the truth in black hoods and black boots
Caps get rocked only when they're fitted
Lyrics get dropped only when they're lifted
So swing to the swell up, the vo chords run amuck
Whatup?  Whatup?  I got mine and you got yours
War's a factor, we'll perspire
And someone in the crowd yells, "Fire! Fire!"
"We don't need no water, let it burn, yo, burn, yo!
"We don't need no water let it burn...." so it burnt
Learn your lesson well, if I don't then I guess you get gelled
Swell, heads go down like the sun
And here it comes

[Hook]

Fiddle-fee, fiddle-fie, fiddle-foe, fiddle-fum
I smell the blood of an English
Muffin, huffin and puffin
Sellin his soul, J-E-L-L-O, ya know?
Roll with the squad who makes back flips stack
Hits upon this so play at your own risk
Tisk, tisk, tisk, ya shoulda used Wisk
Now you shouldn't appeal to be a Biff
Insist that your motor's on scramble
Enter the beats and enter the sample
Ample flow is created by the years and tears
Of crews and blues, perched on the front stoop
Checkin for the bass loop
So the troops roll out and the tows are paid, set and done
And here it comes...
I said here it comes![MC Serch]
Here it comes!  Yo here it is or there it was
But where was it when you need it?  Because
You fall to the waistline when you waste rhymes
Serch got a flow when it comes to phat beats and basslines
I heard the rumors and the fables
Remove them like the tumors on tables
Boomers for the willing and the able
So turn to the next page in your manual
And flim-flam, all over the jam
Chill, lounge - kick your ten little toes up
At the edge of this razor blade and save your spade
As the groove plummets you to another dimension
May I just mention
This is a map, it's for all made for climbin
And you're stuck to your crib like aluminum sidin
Hidin in the back is for crumbs..
And here it comes!

[Chorus]
Here it comes, HERE IT COMES? (repeat 8X)

[MC Serch]
B-boy decoys will try to destroy
Deploy the truth in black hoods and black boots
Caps get rocked only when they're fitted
Lyrics get dropped only when they're lifted
So swing to the swell of the vo-chords run amuck
Whatup?  Whatup?  I got mine and you got yours
Paws are backed up with perspire
And someone in the crowd yells, "Fire fire!"
(We don't need no water, let it burn yo, burn yo
We don't need no water let it burn...) so it burnt
Learn your lesson well, if I don't then I guess you get jelled
Swell, heads go down like the sun..
And here it comes!

[Chorus]

[MC Serch]
Here it.. comes, here it.. comes
Here it.. comes, here it.. comes
Here it.. comes, here it.. comes
Here it.. comes, here it.. comes!

Fiddle-fee, fiddle-fie, fiddle-foe, fiddle-fum
I smell the blood of an English.. muffin
Huffin and puffin, sellin his soul
J-E-L-L-O, y'know?
Roll with the squad who makes backflips stack
Hits upon disc, so play at your own risk
Tisk, tisk, tisk, shoulda used Wisk
So now you sit and appeal to the Abyss
Insist that your motor's on scramble
Enter the beats and enter the sample
Ample flow is created by the years and the peers
Of crews and boos, perched on the front stoop
Checkin for the bass loop
So the troops roll out and the tolls are paid, said and done
And here it comes...
I said here it comes!

[Chorus]

Hit it off, kick it off.. hit it off, kick it off
Hit of off, kick it off.. here it - comes!
Hit it off.. kick it off..
Hit it off.. here it - comes!

[MC Serch]
Aiyyo dumb shoutouts on the remix tip to my man T-Ray
Once again comin up with the fla-VOR!
Anton Koschanski, on the drums (word)
On the guitar (word) on the two-four (WORD!)
With his feet on the floor (WHAT?!)
Givin mad shout outs out to my peoples in Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
To my peoples in Queens (Queens)
To my peoples in the South Bronx (South Bronx)
To all my peoples in Brooklyn (Crooklyn)
To all my peoples in L.A. (L.A.)
To all my peoples in Canada.. (Canada)
To all my peoples in Europe.. (Europe)
To all my peoples in Sweden.. (Sweden!)
To all my peoples in Israel (Is-ra-el)
To my peoples on the moon (On the moon?)
To all my peoples on the sun (Yo, you're buggin)
To my peoples with the weebles, that don't fall down, ha ha ha!
(You're buggin kid!) Peace!
Here it comes, here it comes?
Here it comes, here it comes?
Here it comes, here it comes?
Here it comes, here it comes? {*fades out..*}

I'm in a funky way, I'm in a funky way!
{*laughter as song ends*}Parties all around start checkin for the substance
The context you suspect, but I expect
When Serchlite hits the break..
.. headache, BREAK FOOL
With the groove that's strictly metropolitan
Past go, I'll let you go again the pen emulates
What's heard from the four wheel
And Babyface ain't never seen this crazy whip appeal
Sealed with the hits and blow cause I got hits to go
Fists to flow Michel'le Michelle-low under the mistletoe
I let my missle go, yo
Hands get pound, when it comes down to slick rhymes
No respect in the deuce cool I'm vickin mines
Burnished in New York kids that rolled diesel
Kids swoll big like they were shootin up an AIDS needle
So cling to your mom's memories, calamity's a remedy
To recollect childhood memory lane
Envision, the picture, the frame
The beat that rumbles into the brain
Stains grim gloom carefree feelin, up a buildin cap peelin
Slash from the unwillin blastin off, passin off
To the prevention, locked in detention
Wielding fiends, your dome starts STRETCHIN
To hit the hot spot, and stomp hysterical
The groove that makes you thank God for miracles
Pinnacles are peakin there you find Serch..
.. hittin heads until the head hurts

Migraine, motherfuckin migraine
Migraine, motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine

Rhythm rung gets designed for the kind
That's the deaf the dumb and blind seen here and stated with that
And if you're not gonna hit that, let me rip that
Rhythm hit the rhymes, we give 'em, we leave 'em
Then we'll ghost to the most so the concrete is secured
To endure, three-hundred and sixty-five days of the unsure
Is the way the crumb comes clompin
That's why these boots were made for stompin
Comp is little to none, when the riddle is sung
When who is rappin no beats gets paid
The answer as he gets sprayed by the kids who survived
The playground, of the steel
Who used a fat and funky, as a sort of shiv
Deal to the crew that rolls in batallions
If water was slaughter I'd have to order by the gallon
Pestacides killed the pests, the rest are out the back
Like sweats so jump out the projects, out the building
Out your condo, out your crib, out your co-op!
And let me rip the hip-hop again
Oh shit, Skeff Anslem, he gets props again
Let out the grunt, let out the funk, from out your trunk
Feel the bass and let it PUMP PUMP PUMP

Migraine, motherfuckin migraine
Migraine, motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine

I ain't got no DJ, but that's alright
I ain't got no dancers, but that's alright
I ain't got no choir, but that's alll-riiiiight
All I got left is the mic..
.. SO STRIKE UP THE BAND MAN, as I command man
Float up the damn damn, wash away the flim-flam
Knick-knack quick wack paddywack, give a dog a stick
Then hop off my dialect quick
To the throat I choke, I I need a Coke
Cause I got somethin in my throat.. AHHA-AHEM!  Better?
Let no one get no one up gassed here
On the throttle catch a back of a forty bottle
Models can't roll put a toll into the parkin meter
Crowds around two kids in a four seater
Pack attack crunch from the boom
To give a brother ROOM, TO BREATHE, LEAVE
And pull the card our your sleeve, you're free to roam
As the beat hits the head until you gets home

Migraine, migraine motherfuckin migraine
Migraine motherfuckin migraine
Migraine motherfuckin migraine
Motherfuckin migraine migraine!
Motherfuckin migraine migraine!!
Migraine motherfuckin migraine migraine!!
MIGRAINE? MOTHERFUCKIN MIGRAINE MIGRAINE?!
MIGRAINE! MOTHERFUCKIN MIGRAINE!!!Wait a minute, I'm white!
I can do whatever I'm white
Yeah, I can do whatever I'm white
Yeah

[Hook:]
When I'm in Detroit
I run red lights
The cops don't mind, it's aight
They say, "You can do whatever, you white."
Baby, I can do whatever I'm white, yeah
I got me some clothes, I dress real whack
Bright white pants and a fanny pack
I can dress however I like
Baby, I can do whatever I'm white, yeah

Anything I want I can buy a couple stocks and
I sit outside and I drink some red wine yeah
And the cops drive by
And they shout, " @#!*% yeah"
Cause you know that the cops don't care, yeah

[Bridge:]
I love me some hockey
I need me some hockey
Frisbee's aight
But it ain't no hockey
Buy me a retriever
And listen to Reba
I can be a stay at home dad
Yeah

[Hook]

Any time I want, man
I can go golfing
I can go jogging
Ride on my moped
Ride up to the lake front
In my Dodge Neon
Do me some fishing
And some jet-skiing
Grab me my keys and
Head out to the skate rink
Got my roller blades and
A camcorder taping
I can wear my shorts up above my knees
And I always pay my blockbuster fees, yeah

[Bridge]

One[Intro Skit]
[Karl] Hey what's going on, I'm Hot Karl, I'm here to see VP Serch
[Receptionist] Go right ahead, the door's open
[Karl] Thanks a lot, I'm gonna walk right in there
[Serch] Karl, what's up man, how you doing man?
[Karl] What up, it's good to see you, Serch-
[Serch] Listen, I got somebody on three, hold on. Sheila...
[Karl] Okay-
[Serch] What is- ayy, Dre! Wait, I can't hear him, where's he at?
[Karl] Hey Serch, I thought of some new material-
[Serch] Listen, hold on one second John, I know, I got you, hold on
[Karl] Okay, alright
[Serch] Where's he, in St. Barts? With the family? Alright, listen: I'm gonna call him back and-
[Karl] Oh, that's dope, Serch, I see that-
[Serch] Yo Karl, just give me a second bro
[Karl] Oh
[Serch] Dre, I'm gonna call you back. One

[Verse One]
[Serch]
It's my man Hot Kizzle, take a load off, have a seat
How you feeling, big dog?
[Karl]
Well, good, I think...
[Serch]
Listen, congratulations, I just heard you got signed
[Karl]
I had to stop by, you were my favorite back when you rhymed
[Serch]
Well that was a long time ago, when the rhymes were more slow
KDAY was on our radio, and rappers didn't make dough, but yo
[Karl]
Creatively I really wanted to discuss-
[Serch]
Listen, I been thinking of a formula ever since you signed with us
[Karl]
Oh, a formula, like Serch's D.O.C.-
[Serch]
Now listen! Don't you get snappy with me
[Karl]
I was joking-
[Serch]
Now sit down, we gotta break it down, how to make you sound
First we'll put some freestyles into college underground
Put out two white labels, then two CD singles
Combine 3rd Bass choruses into two-line jingles
Put you on alternative, sold-out tour
Pop your collar! Triple platinum, maybe four!
[Karl]
Wait, hold on Serch, I'm not dissing, but are you listening?
I'm hip-hop and I thought you were too, your point I'm missing
Are you taking my vision to abuse it?
I seen that shit before on Suge Knight's "Behind the Music"
I remember "The Cactus Album", you were a trend-setter
Now you've sold out, you're like 2000's Jerry Heller
[Serch]
Jerry Heller? Let me tell you something, that kid got cash
[Karl]
Sorry, I'll pass, even I know Cube got stuck in the ass
[Serch]
Yep, he got cups filled with stacks, cribs filled with plaques
George-Karl, give it a chance!
[Karl]
Who, me in shiny pants, doing a dance?
I can already hear those "sellout" chants!
[Serch]
No, "sold out", twenty thousand seats in advance!
[Karl]
No thanks, I'll stay underground and bust a B-boy stance
I'm 'a stay true, even if my idol thinks I'm a joke
And I'm a keep it real
[Serch]
Yeah, you're gonna keep it real, alright
[Karl]
That's right, I am 'a keep it real!
[Serch]
You're gonna keep it real broke!

[Hook One]
[Karl]
It's all about the art of hip-hop, no matter if it sells
[Serch]
It's about that Carson Daly and that TRL
[Karl]
We should talk about my thoughts and ideas, gimme the chance to
[Serch]
We should talk about recouping that money we just advanced you
[Karl]
We should talk about the love and the history from the parks
[Serch]
Yes, "106th & Park", number one on their charts
[Karl]
Man, you, got it all wrong, you see, that's not where I'm from
[Search]
Listen, hip-hop is a business, stupid: don't act dumb

[Verse Two]
[Serch]
See, I can understand your dilemma, you're struggling to hold your soul
But after all that struggling: you need to let it go
Free your mind and the dough will flow, it won't be far behind
Just think about the platinum mountain, I've got knives to climb
I'm feeling a little hesistant; you're being obstinate
Credibility of cheddar
[Karl]
I think I'm lactose intolerant
All right Serch, I see what you see, just another white MC
Able to be packaged into cute little CDs
I'm not another gimmick, don't sell me off my image
Don't assume my marketing until my material is finished
Cause no matter what happens it's about my satisfaction
And without a plan B I'll be assed out like Toni Braxton
I'm hip-hop 'til death, what are you insane?
Imagine me with all gold teeth and huge platinum chain!
[Serch]
Hmm... platinum chain, matching fronts
Featuring Cash Money and Manny Fresh, yes Karl, anything you want!
[Karl]
Come on Serch, I was joking!
[Serch]
I'm choking off the cash I'm 'a clear
Karlito, Eminem ain't got shit on you this year!
[Karl]
Aw, listen to this cat, pigeonholing me in rap
Imagining me 'getting jiggy' just to equal SoundScan stats
In fact, G, this could start some beef
I'd rather quit rap than have an R&B joint with Tyrese!
[Serch]
Ah! Hot Karl, another brilliant idea!
Quick, let me call Tony Money and start getting the single cleared!
[Karl]
Ahh dude, are you joking? What are you talking about?
It's becoming obvious why Pete Nice kicked you out!
[Serch]
Don't get it twisted, I left first!
[Karl]
Well, Mr. Big Executive needs to finally get his ego burst!

[Hook Two]
[Karl]
It's all about the art of hip-hop, no matter if it sells
[Serch]
It's about that Carson Daly and that TRL
[Karl]
We should talk about my thoughts and ideas, gimme the chance to
[Serch]
We should talk about recouping that money we just advanced you
[Karl]
We should talk about the love and the history from the parks
[Serch]
Yes, "106th and Park", a free ride on your jock!
[Karl]
Man, you, got it all wrong, you see, that's not where I'm from
[Search]
Listen, hip-hop is a business, man: don't act dumb

[Verse Three]
[Karl]
So I came in here to talk, sit down, and show respect
But I haven't been able to get out one word yet
[Serch]
Karl, you're not listening-
[Karl]
No, listen to me! I was able to get this far
Able to pursue my passion without being a pop star!
[Serch]
Karl, you're not-
[Karl]
SHUT UP! Right here I finally wanna get rid of ya
Burned up in your office like Puffy after Nas's video!
[Serch]
Sheila, get Stoute on two-
[Karl]
Oh, like what's he gonna do?
I'm not a thug but Hot Karl's gonna RUN RIGHT THROUGH!
[Serch]
YES!!! Big Karl, that's what I'm talking about!
You came in an underground MC, but now look how you walking out!
Now you understand my boy, you're ready for the plan
Here's your first advance Chachi, a hundred fifty grand

[Karl]
Yo, that's a hundred fifty G's? All cash?

[Serch]
That's a hundred fifty thousand dollars, Karlito. A hundred fifty G's, can we go to the club now?

[Karl]
Yeah, let's get jiggySerch: We're back and dealing with some really intense baby-mama drama. What I've showed you now three different times, on this stage, is when they approach you - BANG, zero to sixty

Danielle's Mom: And see thing is we never approached him he always approached us

David: No, no, no I'm sick and tired. I'm tired, I'm tired, okay? (We all have!) I've been through hell, I've been through back

Alesha: We all have

Serch: No, let him talk, no

David: Let me talk, I've been through hell, I've been through back, I'm trying to see my kids regardless, the money I make all goes to my kids, I've been homeless, I've been homeless with my daughter, I have been sleeping in tents, I have not had a real home and the reason why I have to jump in jobs is because I can't concentrate when I'm constantly worrying about my kids

Alesha's Mom: Start wearing a rubber!

David: See what I mean? The fu... what's that supposed to mean!?

[Chatter]

Serch: Listen to me, that's not helping. What you just said isn't helping

David: It's like this, real talk. I don't care what anybody says, what matter at the end is my kids. What I'm angry about is that I don't see my kids and I've done everything I can, I've been jumping cities because I'm trying to find the best route to go, I'm going in college, I just got my Phlebotomy certificate. I have 2 weeks of college left. McDonald's flippin' burgers ain't cutting it, because you take 243 dollar check, granted that's going to go to my kids how am I supposed to have a home myself and be able to to support the one I have myself at home, granted I'm worrying about kids in different place but what about the one that is at my house!

Serch: David listen to me, you're dealing with a lot of conflict and a lot of pain , and it's hard to learn to be a man when you don't have a man in your life. So you have a lot of misconception about what being a man is and I feel you, I feel your pain, and I understand, and all I'm trying to say to you is that if you really want to move forward the change that has to be made is how you communicate. I'm going to help you outside of the show, I'm gonna get you counseling, anger management counseling, I'm gonna put you in charge of big brothers, I'm gonna get you a mentor program, what you're not learning is that the love for your children can't be manifested in your anger towards your baby mamas

Danielle's mom: Work on gettin' himself better

Serch: And you have to stop provoking him

Danielle: We don't do anything

Serch: And I respect that, I'm not talking about that

Danielle: No! It's the fact that okay maybe if he got more responsible and was a better person and not cuss me up and down. Maybe then and when he could prove himself to be a better man, then he could see my son.

Serch: Okay but here's the thing, you saying that to him, here...

Danielle: No that shouldn't make him -- I've told him! I don't know how many times, I can't tell you how many times I've told him this

Serch: But here's the thing, you are provoking this

Danielle: No! I'm trying to tell him - look...

Serch: NO! You've told him, I've heard it, you've said it a hundred times, I heard you!

David: And I'm tried of hearing it

Danielle: And I'm not tired of you running up and down cussing me and threatening to take me to court?

Serch: So listen to me, doing a favour, David, we're gonna move forward right now.I want you to look at your baby mommas and say "I will never cuss you out again"

David: I'll never cuss y'all out again

MC Serch: Yeah

KEO: Classmates, homeroom together, 1980? Is that 80?

MC Serch: Yup. I used to follow him around like a puppy dog

SameOldShaw: Nice. And you had some other notable classmates who passed through the school at that time, right?

MC Serch: Yeah, a lot

KEO: The whole Kangol crew

MC Serch: The whole Kangol crew

KEO: Which was Slick Rick, Dana Dane, Al, Omega, Lance Romance, Kool Alski... Those guys were incredible

MC Serch: Jay Cool from the Fresh 3 MC's...

KEO: The Fresh 3 MC's were probably the first guys from Music and Art to have a record deal

MC Serch: F-R-E-S-H fresh fresh fresh, yo that's fresh!

KEO: All the top graffiti writers went there. Mackie was a big influence, was a graffiti writer but also a great drummer who went on to do the Cro-Mags, HR, Bad Brains... What was that group?

MC Serch: David Scilken, who put together the Beastie Boys, the Young and the Useless

KEO: Sure, sure. All those cats were there. Dave Skilken used to write graffiti. I knew those dudes, um -

MC Serch: May he rest in peace

KEO: Yeah, rest in peace. Uh, incredible jazz musicians like...

MC Serch: Sean F. Green

KEO: My best friend that wrote metro, RTW, great graffiti artist - his father was Ron Carter, the bass player. His name was Miles Carter. And I think he was responsible for introducing a lot of the older jazz heads to hip hop, because originally there was beef. The old jazz dudes were like "yo, they're stealing our records". And that's when Stetsa made that response record. And I think Miles was the one that like, got that whole jazzmatazz thing rolling, introducing his father to Q-Tip and Low End Theory and all of that. He's been out in Paris with John Lun doing incredible art. Just everyone there was a fucking star.KEO: It got lumped together. I think famously like, you know, Henry Chalfont's voice on this documentary is saying "There are four elements of hip hop... They're rocking the mic, rocking the floor." You know, initially, graffiti was first. By 10 years before, you know, Kool Herc's first party or whatever. So, dudes in graffiti listened to all types of music, and hip hop came from all forms of music. It came from rock and Afro-cuban and flower children and gang bangers and fuckin' Black Panthers all coming together in this melting pot of New York. And you know, West Indian DJ culture coming in. So I look at hip hop as being a sub-genre or an off shoot of graffiti, other than graffiti being a part of hip hop, because all of the original DJs - Grandmaster Flowers, he wrote Flowers. He went to Erasmus High School. He was a graffiti writer first and foremost. Famous graffiti writer. Herc - famous first generation graffiti writer. All these cats were in graffiti first. And graffiti had a certain way of dressing, a way of talking, a way of competitiveness... You were out to burn the competition, it was all about style and you were battling all the time. And that carried over into everything they did. The graffiti writer DJ - he DJed in a certain style to battle and to burn other crews, right? No other musical genre calls another group a crew. That came from graffiti. No other musical genre really focuses on the competitive battling the way that graffiti does. You hear about it in blues a little, "cutting heads", whatever, but for the most part that came from graffiti writers. So when they dance, they dance aggressively and competitively, and they talk about "you bit my style" - that's all graffiti. That's where all of that comes from. Calling yourself a name like Flash or taking on a pseudonym, or King so and so, Master-this, came from graffiti. The whole attitude, the style, everything. So while some graffiti writers had no interest in hip hop, when it became called hip hop, others invented itSameOldShawn: What would, say, a typical night at the Latin Quarter be like for each of you guys around, circa, mid 80's?

MC Serch: I mean, for me, it was making sure you had the flyest gear. So it was taking your check money and going to the Colosseum. And if Coca Cola had the new shit out then you'd buy some Coca Cola shit. If not then you were checking for some Benneton shit. If it wasn't Benneton shit then you were just going for some Jordache or some Bosco jeans. Then you'd go for some Lottos or you'd go for some Alessi's, you know, get your outfit right. You'd hit the LQ at about 9:30, 10. Cuz' you didn't want to get there too late cuz' it would get crazy outside and they would start fights and everything. Paradise made sure and Lumumba would make sure that if you got there early he would slide you in.

KEO: Rest in peace Lumumba.

MC Serch: Yeah. So you'd get a slice of pizza right quick at the corner, real quick get some pizza, and then you'd dip in and Fat Raoul was the opening DJ so Fat Raoul would be playin'. You'd be chillin'. Then you'd be in the LQ til about 2. You'd see everybody, everybody would be in there. Red Alert would come right after he was on at Kiss and he would DJ for about 2 hours. The whole Violator crew - Chris Lighty, God bless the dead, Darrell, and all those dudes. You'd see everybody. LL would come through, Just Ice would come through, KRS would come through, Ultramag would come through, Stretch and all the dudes from the dances... I.O.U. dancers would come through, Shake and all that. Then, you'd go from there to 155th, The Rooftop. Cuz' the thing was, you could go to Union Square but typically you'd go to Union Square on Saturday cuz' Union Square and LQ are open at the same time and close at the same time, so really unless there was a show, and you'd do half the time at LQ and then you would hop the train and just go down to 14th St., but usually what I would do is head uptown. Because Starchild would be rocking that roller rink til like 4 o' clock in the morning. And people would usually get on and do shows at about 3. So then you'd go up to The Rooftop, do everything, all of that, then go to 145th and Lenox, go to the after hours. Then you'd be there until 12 o'clock in the afternoon. You'd be either smoking woolas, playing dice, listening to music...

KEO: Talking bout the Uptown Garage?

MC Serch: Yup

KEO: When it was upstairs?

MC Serch: Yup. And then you'd go home, sleep it off, and do the same thing the next night. There were different little things like Thursday night was the Red Parrot, so you'd go to Red Parrot because Shante might be doing a show or Juice Crew might be doing a show... That was a little more grown and sexy; they really didn't like jeans and sneakers. Had to get a little grown and sexy. Or if you really wanted to get on some freak shit you'd go to Garage on a Wednesday night with Larry Levan and really get on some watching clue you know, dusted out of your mind... Or you'd go to Union Square where you'd literally be like - it's these two levels that you look down on, there was this balcony, and then the DJ booth was over here and Funkenklein would be there, God bless the dead, and Faith and BMOC and all these dudes from downtown. And if you stayed downtown after 2 you'd go to Save the Robot or go to The World, because they were open til like 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. That was the rotation.SameOldShawn: So he actually put a hit out on you guys, right?

MC Serch: Yes. He put a hit out on us with Mike Concepcion and the Rollin' Crips in LA. $50,000 bounty

SameOldShawn: How did you find out about that?

MC Serch: We were flying to LA on our way to our album release party. Louis Burell - one of the Burell brothers - called Def Jam's office to talk to a woman named Carmen Asher-Swanson, and was like "Are the 3rd Bass guys going to LA?" And they were like "Uh, yeah, they're on their way to their party." And he said, "Good; they're dead" and kinda hung up the phone. No one kinda understood what that meant, so Russell gets put in the mix with it. And basically has to find out what's going on. So they call Eric B, and Eric B says, "Let me make some calls." And sure enough, Eric B finds out through his connections that yeah, there's a hit out on us. So we're in the air, we're on our way to LA. They got to piecemeal all this together. Lyor had a guy that used to do security for Run DMC who worked at Rush. His name is Big D; he's from LA. They put him on a plane, like they sent him to JFk to get on a plane immediately. By hook or by crook, they find out that the guy who's in charge of the hit is this guy named Mike Concepcion, God bless the dead. Mike was already paralyzed from the waist down due to gang violence, but he was still that dude. They get Mike on the phone, and they said, "Listen, Mike, we're from Def Jam. We hear there's a hit out on 3rd Bass." And he's like "Yeah, yeah. My man paid me, it's on and poppin'." And they're like, "Can't happen. Gotta avoid that from happening. How do we avoid that from happening?" And Mike said, "Well, because you called we won't kill them but we'll break their legs from the waist down so they can still do television." And again it was like, "Well, we need them unscathed. How do we make this happen where they're unscathed? We can't have anything violent happen." So that night - the next night was the American Music Awards.

So Mike says, "Well, I'm working on this project called We're All In the Same Gang, trying to, you know, anti-violence thing for Capitol, I'm having a hard time getting distribution, maybe you can help me find a label for it. Eazy-E's on the project; Hammer's on the project; all these people are on the project. Maybe you can help me. Oh and I want to sit next to Michael Jackson tomorrow night at the AMAs." Um, so they're like, "We'll call you right back." So they call Donnie Einer, who at the time was the chairman of Columbia who was distributing our record, and they said to Donnie, "We need your tickets for the AMAs." And he was like, "No." And they were like, "No, no, no, you don't understand. We need your tickets so this guy can sit next to Michael Jackson..." Explains it to Donnie and Donnie says "Fine." So they call Mike Concepcion and they say "No problem, you got it, you're sitting next to Michael Jackson at the AMAs. But we gotta make sure that nothing bad happens to these guys, nothing at all."Once upon a time ago, long before commercialized
Beats became sysnthesized and little girls were mezmerized
There was one mic and one light in a hip-hop shack
And you moved the masses or they moved you out the back
Slack with the skills and you'll never pay the bills
Buying up the brands with the octaginal frills
But when a brother flexed, we called him the Flexor
Beats were the melody, lyrics were the texture
Rhymes were webbed and the Serch light got stuck in
So follow for the record or keep keep on truckin'
Maybe you need the method of finding what the vibe is
Recollect the whole nine just like the Prince of Tides did
Playing what's funny with Muhammed, Tip, and Phife
It's keeping it alive, not a dive from the live
But the dead so selector rewind
To the scenes that are imprinted in my mind

Recollect, the recollections, recollect
The recollections, recollect
The recollections, recollect
The scenes from the mind

Swing with the groove that got you swinging from the rafters
808 state for the kids to the gafflers
Make an impact the community can check for
And if you're on the legend tip, nuff respect for
Coming back to the crew and not to every but T-shirt
Every lunchbox, wack record, don't give a damn
Fan club, yabba dabba doo dud
You can make the fattest record yo, and still be crud
Brothers want to keep you in the heart where the home is
Where the dome is and definitely where the microphone is
Serch knows the one light is bright and don't stench and
Don't bend, so friend, I'll send the flowers to
The funeral home of the hip-hop devoured by the
Mass appeal, you get the seal of removal
Not approval, cause only Woodsy Owl gives a hoot
So nice casket nice suit
Loot can be got for the long haul by the six recs
Down the road and you can still hit the long ball
Out of there, over there to the spectators in aisle nine
Who ain't heard Quest when they told them "Check the Rhyme"
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
As I recollect the scenes from my mind, flute time

Recollect, the recollections, recollect
The recollections, recollect
The recollections, recollect
The scenes from the mind    (Repeat 2x)

Back to the mic to the stand to the light
]From the globe to the lobe to the inner ear so all night
Different tracks can be heard in different arenas
For the clubs, the heads, the rides, the Beemers
Somebody starts checking for the fact Serch is long gone
So I rip clubs from LA to Strech Armstrong
Along the tribal road we lose parts too easily
So I say peace to Eric and Beasly
Bobbito and the '97 street crew
Sec Lover, my brother Honululu
Which and proper Tom is the call for the firm grips
Serch fixes his rhymes, shoots 'em on the sperm tip
Milky is the flow, I hope it stays protected
A&R gets respect for being more selective
Cause gone are the days of the deaf, dumb, and brain dead
And I close the book on the scenes from the head

Recollect, the recollections, recollect
The recollections, recollect
The recollections, recollect
The scenes from the mind    (Repeat 2x)[MC Serch]
Once again, this is your brain
This is your brain on drugs *egg starts frying*
This is your brain on social narcotics
Any questions?

Do you sell drugs (No) Do you carry drugs? (Never did)
But you ain't talking about the drugs inserted in the crib
Of the mind of the youth, young and trying to adapt
To the circles and hurdles and the craps, it's on map
Get the backslap and the "Everything's all right" lecture
Then in school BAM! sit 'em right next to
Mister David Duke, triple K white Aryan
Who tells you pops told him that you were the lesser man
Because of drugs that were put into the books
By the crooks of culture, the truth has a mother's looks
Who blesses and loves every single day
Words from Papa triple K and 66 right way
Take the troops here Mr. "Only Way to Stop It"
I ain't checking for the crack, I'm worried about the social narcotics

This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)

Grumble grumble growl, toss and tumble, ow
How's he living kid (Foul!)
Spoon-feeding is deceiving because I need a fork
And if white people are superior I was delivered by the stork
Taught me that I was superior
Others are inferior, but what's important is the interior
Goddamn it, don't blame it on Janet
The nation got rhythm, but the rhythm ain't good
Not in my neighborhood
But will that change the devilish global way of thinking?
Homeboy, as fast as the eye starts blinking
But I'm just one man, one man one sister one brother one cousin
That helps another, to change change a place and change a pace
So the rats don't win the rat race
Cause every time a clock goes "tick" another falls vic
To the social narcotic

This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)

[Fatal]
Yo social narcotics, a dangerous way of life
Talk to the young which will now deal with strife
Parents teaching their kids to be racist
So they grow up tricking, show hate to some faces
The side effects get me real vexed
Seeing people trying to flex case they got a color complex
Innocent children I see stay addicted
Getting high off of hate, that's why pain stays inflicted
To another color, it's a black and white fight
In Fatal's sight, that's why I gotta enlighten
The blind minds of those that fell in this harsh reality
A social abuse that attacks the mentality
Cause race against race only brings friction
Pain and infliction, cause that's the addiction
Those that fall victim now walk around headless
Cause the drug that they took made them an addict to prejudice

This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)

[MC Serch]
This land is your land, this land is my land
From the streets of Compton to the Brooklyn island
From my people in prison to the Red Fern projects
This land was made for you and me supposedly
You never taught me true history
We killed the Indians and showed it as a victory
Original man, pilgrims saw him as a caveman
Convert to be Christian or become a slaveman
Indian brought the corn and the bread and in return
We gave 'em muskets to the head? Damn
Right back to the have-nots
Now in '92, lowered to be mascots
The Redskins, the Indians, the Atlanta Braves
What if we called the team "The Atlanta Slaves"?
Brothers would have a field day
Don't you understand now we got to turn the right way?
Cause every time a clock goes "tick" another falls vic
To the social narcotic

This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)Adapted from a chapter in the Jay-Z biography EMPIRE STATE OF MIND: HOW JAY-Z WENT FROM STREET CORNER TO CORNER OFFICE. Published by Portfolio/Penguin. Copyright (c) Zack O'Malley Greenburg, 2012.

“That deal was the most fucked-up deal that I’ve ever seen or heard of,” says Michael Berrin, better known as MC Serch of 3rd Bass, with an intensity that makes me think he’s about leap out of my phone and into my office. “I came to Jay-Z with the automobile industry in my back pocket to do a Shawn Carter edition vehicle that he approved, only to have the automobile industry basically shoot it down for fear that he was a bigger star than the car.”

Just as he’s about to explain what happened, Serch is interrupted by the blare of a cell phone (the ringtone, fittingly, is Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind”). When I press him for more details about the vehicle, he tells me that it was going to be a “Jay-Z Jeep” painted “Jay-Z Blue.” Then he starts to say something else, but stops short.

“That’s really a Marques McCammon question,” he says. “I haven’t spoken to Marques in a long time.”

***

Jay-Z’s ability to make money by attaching his name to products is one of his greatest strengths as a businessman, and it’s especially important given the ever-declining numbers in the record industry. In 2012, the year after Empire State of Mind went to press, he pulled in $38 million—less than one quarter of which came from album sales. Over the past few years, Jay-Z has shilled for Reebok, Hewlett-Packard, and Budweiser; in the wake of my chat with Serch, it was clear that Jeep was slated to join that list until something went wrong.

Finding out what happened to the Jay-Z Jeep starts with Jay-Z Blue, a color dreamed up by Jay-Z and marketing guru Steve Stoute. A decade ago, they approached industrial designer Adrian Van Anz with the idea of creating a shade to trademark as Jay-Z’s own. Van Anz, creator of the vodka-cooled computer and jewel-encrusted iPod, happily obliged by creating a reflective, silvery medium-blue color with a dash of platinum dust. “Gave it a little bit of my personality,” Jay-Z reportedly joked. “I’m known for platinum.”

“Jay-Z Blue is a license for corporations to get Jay-Z in the building,” Stoute told Rolling Stone in 2005. “Cars, laptops, lots of different things. I got deals lined up like you don’t understand.”

The Jay-Z Jeep seemed to be the car in question. But after three months of pestering industry sources and trying to reach Marcus McCammon, I wasn’t getting anywhere. And so, on a sunny spring day, I found myself at the front desk of a nondescript office building in San Diego, paying a surprise visit to my last hope for clarity on the Jay-Z Jeep.

“I’m here to see Marques McCammon,” I tell the receptionist brightly.

“Is he expecting you?”

“Well, no.”

Five minutes later, a stocky man in his late thirties ambles in and introduces himself as Marques McCammon.

“The skinny,” he says, “is this.”

He lowers himself into a seat across the table from me.

“I was in the process of having some discussions with Jeep … They were trying to skew a little bit younger, they were getting ready to launch the Jeep Commander, the first seven-passenger Jeep to hit their portfolio. It was supposed to be the granddaddy of the Jeeps, the most luxurious.”

McCammon’s first conversations with Jeep and parent Chrysler took place in late 2004, as part of his job at American Specialty Cars, a company often hired by Detroit automakers to make quirky-looking models like the throwback pickup Chevy SSR.

Hoping to secure a contract from Chrysler to produce a souped-up version of the Jeep Commander, McCammon asked the well-connected Serch what it would take to get Jay-Z to lend his name to the vehicle. “Serch was like, ‘Yeah, it’s gotta be the top of the line, it has to be the best of the best,’” McCammon recalls.

McCammon took the idea back to the executives at Mopar (short for “Motor Parts”), the automobile parts and services arm of Chrysler. With their blessing, he would have Serch reach out to Jay-Z and start the process of agreeing on terms and picking specs for the vehicle. But getting approval from the Chrysler brass proved to be tougher than McCammon had anticipated. “I probably went to four different executive-level meetings with directors and VPs inside of marketing at Chrysler,” he says. “I spent most of the time just trying to break down the stereotypes or the misconceptions of Jay’s evolution as a person.”

McCammon persisted, arguing that a Jay-Z Jeep would be the best way to rejuvenate the brand’s image. By the beginning of 2005, he’d prevailed upon Chrysler’s executives and Serch had convinced Jay-Z’s camp to take a meeting in Detroit. The duo started brainstorming the vehicle’s specs: butter-cream leather seats, twenty-two-inch chrome wheels, and a digital entertainment system preloaded with all of Jay-Z’s songs. The color? Jay-Z Blue.

According to McCammon, negotiations for Jay-Z’s up-front fee were to start at $1 million, plus up to 5 percent of every Jay-Z Jeep sold. With its impressive list of specs, the vehicle would have retailed for about $50,000, in the neighborhood of what a normal Jeep Commander would cost with all options included. The initial run of one thousand vehicles was projected to earn Jay-Z $2,500,000 in total—and exponentially more if it enjoyed the mainstream success that McCammon and Serch expected—all for simply lending his name to what was, quite literally, a cross-promotional vehicle. Says Serch: “It would have been a home run.”

The week before Jay-Z was set to fly to Detroit to seal the deal, McCammon called Chrysler to confirm. But in the days after McCammon convinced the company’s executives of Jay-Z’s legitimacy, there had been a reshuffling of management. The new boss didn’t want anything to do with Jay-Z, a former drug dealer, despite appeals from McCammon.

“We kind of got brushed off,” McCammon recounts. Serch puts it less diplomatically. “The automobile business is run by elitist white men who are very scared of losing their power, who would rather see the whole thing crumble and fall apart than to give up their power.”

***

In January of 2007, just two years after the collapse of the Jay-Z Jeep deal, General Motors hosted a gaudy gala on the eve of the North American International Auto Show in a gigantic tent on the shores of the Detroit River. A procession of celebrities, including Carmen Electra and Christian Slater, escorted new vehicles down a brightly lit runway. But the star of the show was the man who emerged from a GMC Yukon—none other than Jay-Z—who received a seven-figure check for his efforts.

Like its conceptual predecessor, the Jay-Z Blue Yukon never made it to the streets. But that doesn’t mean Jay-Z’s dealings with Detroit were a failure. Yes, Chrysler backed out of the Jeep deal, and GM never planned to actually sell a Jay-Z-branded vehicle. But in the end, Jay-Z was paid a heap of money to simply walk out of an automobile.

Perhaps by that point, he’d decided there wasn’t a future for Jay-Z Blue anyway, and the Yukon deal was the best he could get. As Warren Buffett has said, “Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.”

Jay-Z was wise not to spend too much time on the latter.

Uhh, c'mon now.. come come now..
C'mon now.. can you dig it?
Uhh uhh, c'mon now.. come come now..
Yeah, c'mon now.. can you dig it?

[MC Serch]
I've seen times change, watchin the rhymes change
From good to bad to worse from worse to hearse
Why is it the hearse makes all the papes?
I know you're mad phony y'know like counterfeit tapes
Hit one, strip one, rip one to the bad boy and ya find
There ain't nothin there no more
You're blowin smoke up, where there ain't no sunlight
And I don't need KFC to show me how it's done right
I rip mics I grab mics I wreck mics until I'm hoarse
And when I can't rhyme I'll go home and read The Source
Peace to the streets the thugs the vandals and the hoods
You dig it, you dig it, you dug it?  Good

[Chorus]
Then c'mon now.. come come now..
You've got to c'mon now.. can you dig it?
C'mon now.. come come now..
C'mon now uhh.. can you dig it?

[MC Serch]
Diggin the vibe cause the vibe is what I'm diggerin
Triggerin samples bigger sounds Serch must begin again
Did what I had to dig, a tractor-trailer and a rig
Cannot get this big; your voice is foul - stop smokin cigs
And put your life back in order
Met Chantelle at Taco Bell and made a, run for the border
Saw all the dust and ma and pa doowops is who I trust
And some old school kid tried to come back but his lyrics were all rust
And mustard ketchup, sauerkraut and relish
Sell this crap I like to rap but hey yo that's my fetish
Kick the smoooooth style - I hope that y'all can get it
And if you don't you dig it you got it come on and kick it

[Chorus]
C'mon now.. come come now..
C'mon now.. can you dig it?
C'mon now.. come come now..
C'mon now.. can you dig it?

I'm hip to the dig, I'm hip to the dig
I'm hip to the dig, I'm hip to the dig
I'm hip to the dig, I'm hip to the dig
I'm hip to the dig..

Dumb shout out to my man Ken Kesney on the 24Serch slut for the quick view, but then I come back to dick you
Down, down, down, get up
When will you learn that when you try to flip
First you have to learn the role, calm control
Then bust combust, explode, blow your load
But on yourself call for help? Who come for help on a crumb?
No one, nada, zero zilch
Try to see this, you'd better but on some stilts, son
Serch will find the one, but the one you found was me
Go plug the puffed head til it's all empty
Plenty plenty more when I come pull your card, what?
Good vibrations only when my dick is hard
So if your booty ass lyrics don't get to me, the stench will
Copy my shit like that, use a stencil
Potential, can't get a piece of this rock
When I go pop pop pop, Simon says "Stop"
Begin, begin, weak blends, weekends, the stunts in sequence
Can't find the move or the groove for the weekend

Scuds get drop and Serch stops all the madness
Yeah right, like you was ever gonna have this
Nonsense, square the sense and add a comma
Begin with a coma, look what I've shown ya
Ain't no use, so don't try and play cool, bitch
Stomp out the kids in blue jeans and Goose Woolridge
Bitch is a duck with six feet at all ends
And on your deathbed your girl's fucking your best friend
Show signs the time troop dismiss the her
Cause when the bitch plays softball, she gots to go
So don't try to chuck, you get the knuckle for the peeping
My crew starts leaping with the groove for the weekend

Served in straight sets cause you rhyme like you got Torret's
*gooo boy guaaaaahhh* You're next!
Complex diagrams of rhymes to flex
A man go and use the cracks to sharpen the hex, sex
Still come back and get served in straight sets
Domes get sent to the pipe
Cause I'm the baddest white boy to ever fucking touch a mic
Like it or not, I don't care about the Hammer
But he'd be my bitch if me and him was in the slammer
So, handle the Kibbles and Bits and rap starter kits
Get blown to bits for the weekend and that's it

That's all that's it for the weekend, that's it *what?*
That's all that's it for the weekend, that's it *what?*
That's all that's it for the weekend, that's it *what?*
That's all that's it for the weekend, that's itSerch s*** for the quick view, but then I come back to dick you
Down, down, down, get up
When will you learn that when you try to flip
First you have to learn the role, calm control
Then bust combust, explode, blow your load
