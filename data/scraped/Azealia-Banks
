[Hook: Childish Gambino]
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night (x2)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day you call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me
That "A" on my chest like adultery
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, nevermind
It was time, number nine, lies
Feline with a deathwish
E-vite didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we were destined

[Hook: Azealia Banks & Childish Gambino]
See now I don’t wanna see an era (no), an era (no), an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
(You and me)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Fireworks)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Oh, all the stars)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Super moon)
Maybe it's the last night

[Bridge: Azealia Banks]
All that I have
All I don't have's the future
Take on my soul
All night

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
They godless, denied us
But we don't give a damn about the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the truth then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, never know fear
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress the only thing that will last
3005, the year that we fear, only God will survive
To be alone is alive

[Hook: Childish Gambino & Azealia Banks] (x2)
See now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night (x5)

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
(She got that body, oh me oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY) (x2)
GPOY (x6)
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY

[Ad-libs: Childish Gambino]
I've been thinking about you[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
I’m so cold I’m dripping icicles
I go and take your man that nigga Might miss you
Spent his whole commission on my neck and ear
To stand around me need to have ya winter gear
Pay me coats and benz's and that berg-ice
That’s why I do not feel these bitches, Frostbite
Grown money, ever since a youngin' made my own money
You broke honey, and they call me Banks, cause I can loan money
Colder than December, my diamonds on Anna Wintour
So that’s fly ice in my life
I don’t see no limits so i strive and I shine twice
I ride around and get it, just listen for a minute
That was only one thought let me finish...
Competition Imma beat 'em so relentless
Ima be legendary when I end this
They rise when I arrive in this
“All Hail The Supreme Ice Princess!”
Tell the carriage, hurry up and come and get me
Tell the haters run along you can miss me
Hollywood you can go and A-list me..
I like a shot of hard whiskey..

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey & Azealia Banks]
Feelin' it, I'm feeling a change
I'm feeling it, in the air
I’m feelin' it, I'm feeling a change
I'm feeling it, in the air
So let me in!

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Her motives is frozen
Giving chill pill to them polars
Corrosive, the coldest, city is a tundra
Stay focused, No wonder, - Frigid princess come from
Cold cash and them ice chunks, Stone frost in my Celine pumps
Rolls-Royce, snow white-ups
Colder than December, diamonds on Anna Wintour
These glaciers glamour and glisten
Antarctic, it's like a blizzard, my jargon (is)
“fuck you i’m frigid”
Cool it down or get avalanched
Igloo’d cold-cased and bodied
And ice-cubed up in the lobby
Bitch, white fox, peep the opulence…
Ice box the coolest confidence
Isis-Queen, the Icy-Witch
Winterfresh in that whitey-Benz
Shimmering Aphrodite
Winter-wonderland body so frosty in that bugatti
Porcelain-Snowflakin’ Papi , popsicle in ya pocket…
I’m polarizing ya profits
I freeze ‘em, flip ‘em, and rock it
Cocoa a-la mode, who’s frozen from head to toe
Ice-grillin’ the status quo
Cold-killer so now you know

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey & Azealia Banks][Intro]
Remy Boyz, yeaahhhh

Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
Got 50, 60 grand, 500 grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go

[Hook 1: Fetty Wap]
And I get high with my baby

[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
She came whipping that cake for the hustle
Ey, she cooking that steak in the oven
Got pies on the side I can bake by the dozen
Give a shake to them bitches in front of it, it's nothing
Bando, bomb shell, miss ?? who mix well
Fish scale, hopping out that V-12, this female
All about them eagles
Queen flips, I'm on regal
She sells seashells, hydro with that pyro
Getting money, getting it right though

Contraband for survival, you light though
Bobby got his eyes low
Ready for that pop, though
Is that so?
Anything for that guap flow
We got drugs, you got us

[Hook 2: Azealia Banks]
And I get high with my baby

Macaroni, boy, you're only blinding me
And I told the squad like every nigga signed to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
I'm like "hey, what's up, hello"

And Imma need you to cook a baby

Look at the thighs on her
Oh, I wanna ride on her
And we in a coupe goin' crazy
Go to Venezuela, that's a getaway vacation
She the trap queen, she cook it

You a pussy, so I took your bag
If you get money with your baby say "yeaaahhh"


[Hook][Verse 1]
Look, niggas really wanna beat they chests, for B-A-N-K-S

So since you vanilla men spend

Hey, I’m the liquorice bitch

No issues picking money over ha-ha, ya beige in her
She just wanna see the best in Greece with some gentlemen and check these beats in the sun
He just wanna see the wet-wet weave when I’m swimming in the West Indies
Then I sit up and catch these breeze
Sip a little bit of Rum & Ting, nigga

[Verse 3]
These bitches know that I be on that black girl shit
That black girl pin-up with that black girl dip
Put that black girl spin up on ya whack girl tip
Ain’t official till it been up in that black girl kit
Pick out ya mans and attack real quick, I’ma hit him with that venom and that rap girl hip
I slip out the denims, know that black girl fit, get that Remy in a did and hit that black girl switch
Bitches better tan for the summer, and for the haters, quit that chit chat, and get ya paper

The cherry-melange bitch verbatim
When I speak about your face in the clam with the flavors

And stimulate her
Take a lick up on my genital, then sit to savor
Do ya man’s and his licorice interest a favor

Came in the game with a beat and a bounce
Never for the fame, my feet on the ground
Cloud number nine, headed to the stars
Maybe I ride with my mic in my bra
Maybe I recite in the raw the appetite for life and the hunger for the more
The island of Manhattan
I was Born in New York, city never slumbers
I would always dream but never sleep to the hundreds
Cocoa want the cream in abundance
Million dollar baby you can get it if you want it, what

And that I am that young sis the beacon
The bitch who wants to compete and

-You know what your bitch become when her weave in
-I just wanna sip that punch with your peeps and
Sit in that lunch if you're treatin'
-Kick it with your bitch who come from Parisian

Hey I can be the answer
Finna step up the game like a dancer
Boy if you a Soulja, call me commander
You rappers wanna be friends? Call up Chandler
Roll up to your joint and smoke whoever in it
I ain’t talking Mary Jane, who gon save ya by the minute?
Leave your dreams crushed wrecked diminished
It’s the misfit, the robust reject he’s still living
Shit talkers talkin’ no time to intervene
All I be doing is screaming Fuck you like Cee-Lo Green
And I ain’t going nowhere baby
I’mma be right here
It’s Hip-Hop’s bastard baby
I’mma be right here
So keep on hating baby
Cause I’mma be right here

Ayo AB, I’mma get em

[Verse 2: Young Marone]
Ain’t stopping till I’m poppin’ as the chronic topic
Boy you floppin’ and I’m rockin', that’s that common logic
Got em locked in
As an idiotic hostage
Bars turning em to products of neurotic convicts
Yeah I’m blazing it up
Aiming at engravin' my name on the cup
Misbehaved and it’s blatant, I don’t give a fuck
Inflaming the game with flames, kuntbrigade wassup?
Got that homer flow
That means I’m all about my dough
It’s in my genes to rap tight like women’s clothes
Give em vaccines, I think they been diagnosed
With that marone syndrome
Chasing my dreams, feel like I’m getting close
Spittin’ that dope, make you overdose
I’ma motherfuckin’ nuisance, information disclosed
Man I’m feeling unstoppable
My time’s optimal to feel irresponsible
Call up the constable, tell him he’ll be facing a bigger obstacle
Cause I’m the problem I’m unsolvable
Make ya dance, till ya get hurt, in your abdominals
It’s impossible, these rappers beating me? That’s improbable
It’s Hip-Hop’s bastard baby but I’m rap adoptable

[Bridge: Azealia Banks]
Ayo, I heard you're riding with the same tall, tall tale
Telling them you made some
Saying you're grinding but you ain't going nowhere
Why you procrastinate girl
You got a lot, but you just waste all yours and
They'll forget your name soon
And won't nobody be to blame but yourself yeah

[Hook: Azealia Banks]
What you gon' do when I appear
W-when-when I premiere
Bitch, the end of your lives are near
This shit been mine, mine

But back to the subject
What ya’ll expect, tell X I run shit
Tell Lazy Jay, I got him a message
R.I.P. to the beat, an instrumental death wish

[Hook]We gon' do something
That yo've never heard before!

[Verse 1]
These public pool bitches
Ain't really mermaids
Private beach Malibu, nigga!
Weave up in the shade
How do you? Hardly figure
That you that other wave?
She party pretty
She party plenty
It's like everyday
Documentary, will film the picture
It’s a fantasea
Get another, pitcher (of) liquor
Off that tanqueray
Okay, celebrate, let's celebrate
That aquababe, sashay
Boulevard, Runway
Bitches, witness bitches
They've been afraid
These nigga's bitches be bitches
They smellin' of fish and eggs!
She sell the bigger, the bigger
Difference gave it all away
Seashells on my two ta-tashies
See she got it up on display
Hooray!

[Verse 2]
We knockin'
Got it poppin' like a parade
Your opinion is just a option
Fucker what you say?
I'm looking like, I look right
Niggas look-a-ways
I pop 'em, clap 'em, cock 'em, blam 'em
Let the choppa spray
The brolic Madame
The chunky clunky, 3-8
Trust me you don't want that
Rusty, rowdy piper, okay?
Okay, okay, huh?
(Okay, okay, huh?)
(Okay, okay, huh?)
(Huh? Huh? Huh?)

[Verse 3]
Cinnamon: gentlemen
Want that kind of taste
I be killin' 'em, killin' 'em
Like murder everyday
When Azealia
The AB is on display?
I hit you, split you
Lift you, dip you
Get up out the way
The niggas is swank
My bitches is stank
All these chickens
Out for dollars
All they get is the franks
The linens is blank
The middle is pink
He gon put that snorkel on
We gon dip in the tank
I focused
I floated out the bluest ocean
To splash on your set, honey
Get the ships in motion
Bitches seasick
These bitches be opposing
Bitches see me
Yes, these bitches be all open
You don't want it
No you don't really want it
I'm drownin' all on my haters
And surfin' the moment

(Swimming in all this paper)
(Back, strokin' hundreds)
(Swimming in all this paper)
(Back, strokin' hundreds)

[Verse 4]
The chitter-chatter
Don't really matter
You silly rabbit
That could get'cha
G-get'cha get'cha
Your carrot splattered
All linens, fabrics
I'm diving backwards
And livin' lavish
Aqua-fancy
She get it, splash it
Then dip it back in

Ha, ha[Hook]
Hi, hi, alright, hey, alright
Why ya been running your mouth

When I don't mention ya, and I heard way of word, when I was in New York, NY

I, I, I know you'd might like to be up in her world
Wwould ya, smile and wave when you sight her?
And try to say hello, tell me you mean no harm
Let's ride and let's go under..

[Verse 1]
You know I spit slick game, slick game, to the brothers
When I hip pop slang bang-bang for the summer
I’m the twist, - slick dame they say you the son of

So they nick-nick name-named me your mother
If the fifth pop, prey, pray for your butter
You in tip top shape, shift-shape nigga run it
Lil sis skate(s), straight, straight to the coven
Little witch pop, Jupiter queen
Your bitch make hits never do it for free
I can’t take that risk, never 2 out of 3
I took the blue out the sea
And put the blue in the weave
I did the bam dance nigga then it blew in the breeze
And Word to you and to me I get the blue and the cheese
If you a big shot nigga I’m-a sue ya, believe!
I spit the truth and believe
I'll Hit your tooth with the nin
Little witch pot nigga, nigga who could it be?

Late night
Coming down Broadway
Niggas ain't stuntin'
They riding the four train
These niggas ain't fly, got wings like always
You’re finger-fuckin' the pussy
Lickin' it all day
Niggas on me cause my position is real sweet
Niggas on me cause all my fabrics cost change
He ain't stylin enough to be ballin
Kobe Bryant, Odom, Ray Allen, and Paul Pierce
Combined in one frame
Part of my water, but this my wave
You take orders like a chicken sauté
Tartar sauce on the fried fish I ate
Bitches tried to shimmy my shake
Bitches try to Diddy my ma$e
Who runs the city, I'll break both legs
Best thing going, y'all bitches is okay
Bitches on the wrong course, this my lane
Proper, proper all my propaganda
Puffin with some Rastas
Puffin better puff a shot
Whistle for my masters, coke headed models
Dope on arrival, visa is en casa
Been in Bahamas
Eating all this chocolate
Tell me Willy Wonka-Wonga
I'm a Mac Truck
And you niggas are Tonkas
Niggas act up then it's gorillas and their armours
Get clapped up nigga you can get applauded
Stitch you back up, get you fitted in your garments
It will be me on the roof with the harness
Just AZ I don't need no accomplice
Better roll deep with little GG, CC, we we
I'm a bust a nigga and gun him in his pee pee
Niggas better hide their little brother when they see me
All these niggas riding with they cholos till the heat squeeze

Are you an Aquarius? You act like an Aquarius

[Verse 1]

You know my liberty ain't?? clean and my ghetto fancy
If your man spits the digits, I'mma spend his damn change
I'mma vamp with the ribbon and the little panties
When I pound?? to the rhythm and these bitches can't breathe
And she a lead, she a damn champion
Do the dance for you nigga like a damn banji (ha)

[Hook]

It's little little bam-bambi
I know all these bitches really can't stand me
Can't stand me (x4)

So bang it against the wall
No one wants to see you fall down
The repetition kills you (x2)
Put your hands over your eyes

Do you guys do drugs?
Well, you should try it, I bet you'd really really fuckin' like it...[Intro]

(Pretty in the face and) A bitch look plastic (x2)

[Verse 1]
What up, I fucks with all things monetary
My urge for the dough is involuntary
I need that cream like Ben and Jerry
I'm so caked up in the commissary
Used to eat mad chips at the front of the ?
Now I stack mad chips at the front of the ?
And I got mad clips at the front of the Jeep
So don't get caught trying to sample the cheese, huh
Nacho like you can't have lactose
I stay with new shit like assholes
Smoke that weed, get buck like rascals
Niggas wanna pop, put them up like tadpoles
Who's that? Who's me? You already know
Ms. Banks, 18, all about the dough
Mocassins, zooted jeans and polo
Frank hat, 151 logo
In Soho, eyes low from the loco
Cause I hit that swish like a chokehold
Y'all just clowning, niggas straight Bozos
Still cherry lounging? Man that's an old flow
??
A bitch don't dance? better do it for 5 g's
Niggas stay frontin' like their clothes worth somethin'
Well that looks like H&M to me
Run around town talking about a triple beam
And they getting cream and they got the nina
Done coined a misdemeanor
Felony money, that's my demeanor
I keep this cash like my eyelashes nigga, long and pretty
I get flyer than the next bitch do, and I never had to put one brick in the womb

[Hook]
(Long weave, lipstick) I-I be on that Barbie Shit (yeah!)
(Pretty in the face and) A bitch look plastic (x4)

[Verse 2]
That bitch own a pair of sixes, but I own a pair of fives
And my Nudie jeans look better than her Levis
Bitches steady hating, anticipating and waiting
For conversation, they wanna come chill with the dope bitch
Long weave, lipstick, I be on that barbie shit
Got a pack of swishers and a bag of purple ??
I like freaky-deaky shit, so a freaky bitch (keep uh...)
Big dick niggas at the top of my buddy list
Won't sex till ya lick my clit and tell me where the money is
Dumb birds, just occurred they get no words like sign language and shit
We just pull up in the whip
Cock that 4-5th like I'm missing one finger, bitch
That last line was clever
Duck, Duck, Bitch, get down like feathers!
A-Z-E-A-L-I-A is G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Clap on a nigga like Ay Bay Bay
We'll pull the trigger out in broad day
So y'all bitches better watch where the fuck you look and what you say

I like to masturbate when a nigga just came
And it's just tight lame if he don't give brain
Procrastinate and play with the nipples
Touch it in the middle then pop it like a pimple
There's no debate, gotta do it, impress
By the right index in that pink flesh-
Yeah, nigga, im a vet
Learned how to get wet when I turned 11
Late night robin bird was heaven'
I got a little porno obsession
Now I got skills in the trade like stefan
If you got skills, we can trade like best friends
But I don't mind going solo, no homo, but I cum better dolo

Took batteries, and came in purple

Hit it up with a silver bullet
Turn up the pinky, that bitch is freaky

But I will not suck a tit like her
Lick a clit like her, cause I prefer
To get stuffed up like animal
And let a nigga eat like cannibal
Wax that ass like candle do
And gimme my spread like cancer do
Yeah, you better follow my format
Or get back to the steps and doormat

Yank my weave and scream my name
Say my name like a Ray-Ban frame
Keep that stiff like John McCain

Tell me what bad boys do
I'm a bad girl, if you into that one too
My American Dream in jeans all blue
Keep it cool like crushed ice cubes
It's you felonious in a foreign coupe
In the blue range across my view
Better crush like my cunt too
Ain't 'nough said about his moves
A real tough one, sometimes two
Bet you fine about lifetime sunshine boo
(Say you remember!)
Bananas and bow ties, whips and handcuffs
Tied down the club like living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bodies all around, put it down like an
Anchor
(Say you remember!)
Hardcore bottles
Try more than just anger
Passion like fever
Hot like Jamaica
Real rude boy, no problem for later
Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper
Truth be told he's locked down with his flamer
Really like his flavor
Wanna slow dance with the devil
Click-lick, the look of an angel
Took a small chance with a rebel now my flesh is amazing
Now we shooting them lasers and laughin' at haters

Gangsters not dead I raise 'em

I get the *shots* like high fives
Leave your *boy* hanging out on a clothes line
Play peek-a-boo through a slit like blinds
And seen his little meat like chicken pot pie
His chicken pox eyeballs fall underneath
Up stack street time to retreat
Meet me in the middle hit the door like road runner
Change my screenname and phone number
Hit your dick with the duce like pop
There ain’t a buck that keeps enough to make *bullet* Okay *gunshot*
Bang, I’d rather *toilet flushes*
Through the bladder
Now pop quick like handsoap lather
No cigs excuse, no niggas on my block
Your condom fit like a skittle in a sock
I haven’t had a tater tot since I ate school lunch
So you can eat the *broken glass* while I face these blunts

[Interlude] (x4)
Oooooooh, Yeah!
(Oooooooh, Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Starvin' Marvin *broken glass* to pull me
Sweeter than ya lass I’ll be your teacup and you know we gotta *gunshot*
Before we gets to feed herbs
You follow, I’m the leader
You Tamera I’m the Tia cause I *gunshots*
You stuck on, dumb dumb! *gunshot*
Better make me *gunshots*
All I want is *broken glass* and then some
And umm…
A set of (gunshot) rings, and them
Excuse me? (gunshot)
Look, pardon me
My bitch is beat like card 3
Make a *gunshot* feel sauced like it’s hard to be
Ya *Broken Glass*
Don’t bother me
Too strict like year-long Halloween
Pull up to Banks like Collard Greens
Broke ones won’t get no far to me
Cheap is what I find hard to be

[Hook: Mr. Vegas] (x2)

[Interlude] (x16)[Intro]
(Damn nigga damn, took a chance on ya, double and dipped again)
GO!
You could do your dance
Take a chance with your lover like this began!
Sing

[Verse 1]
I want somebody who can take it apart
Stitch me back together make me into who I wanna be
But all you ever do is sit in the dark
Dealing with the Devil, you ain’t never ever gonna be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I’m born to dance in the moonlight
I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow
White lies, I don’t wanna be around anymore
I’m through giving, I’ve got to go....

[Chorus]
Am I chasing time?
Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Am I chasing time? (time)
Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)

Check my watch, I had the future in my pocket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)
If tomorrow drops, I had my time right in my locket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, nigga, damn
Took a chance on you, double and dipped again
And, scram, nigga, scram
Hit your mans up and tell ‘em to get the van
And reminiscing can't
Bring it back to the cabin in Michigan
But man, this the plan
Say goodbye to your lover cause this the end

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yo, get lost hit the highway, freeway
We've been off-course like the wrong-way relay
Need me a boss, you’re a constant delay
These the kinda thoughts I've been having for three days...
Feel like you’re more of a homie
Please, you don’t even know me
You think I’m starting new relations
I’m just departing and need my space and
Time to myself, ventilation
No time for you, I lack the patience
And you’re like, “Girl, how you do that?"
My attitude is bitchy but you already knew that...
And since we can’t get along
I think we should both move on
(GO!)

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus][Verse 1]
Champ in the buil', and what the deal?
This about to be another jam on the reals
You could dance if you with it with ya gams on stilts
But ya can't can't slip up on her dance floor
She'll steal your man if she meet him, and ya man toss chips
Went to France and Ibiza, hundred grand for the trip
When I land, I get greeted with the Lamb on the strip
Little Bam swiped her Visa for the glam and the fit
Damn lil' diva you the champ, you the shit
You the glamour, the glitz
You a vamp, you a witch
Listen up my nigga you a fan, you a trick
You be amped to the spits, with ya mans in the whip
And heard ya rich, heard ya rich nigga rich
Heard ya clique hit a lick and ya stick to the bricks
And if it splits, get ya cran and ya tips
Put ya hand on ya dick, take a gander at this

[Hook]
Hi, ribbon up my mind, open up my eyes
Realise this, and show me show, show me, one time (ay ay)
Ride, a lift in your ride, the look in your eyes, I like it
So won't ya show show me, one time? (ay ay)

[Verse 2]
I'm everywhere you can't go, I'm everywhere you wish you could
I'm stitched-ed up in that Van Vogue, my weave long and my pussy good
I lift it up and I tip it slow, that chocolate body, that tootsie roll
That flirty Hershey, lawd' a mercy, do it to me, don't hurt me, hurt me
Roly poly, float ya boatie, dick get up - it's so swolly swolly
Swollen swollen, he holding, he packing pack
And I'm throwing back, and I'm counting racks while he lick the crack
If he acting up then he getting slapped
If I pop the truck then he getting clapped
I'll pop ya rump, and I'll split ya back

[Hook]
Hi, ribbon up my mind, open up my eyes, realise this, and show me show, show me, one time (ay ay)
Ride, a lift in your ride, the look in your eyes, I like it
So won't ya show show me, one time? (ay ay)

[Verse 3]
Can I get that?
Can I get that whip?
Can I take that trip?
Can I get that grip?
Can I split that chip with my bitch pack?
Where my rich cats?
Where ya keep that ship, when ya hit that strip?
And ya hit that sand, in the sand, get a tan on ya six pack
Where my bitch pack?
Where ya get them clothes?
How you make that roll?
How you make that dough?
Sip it slow, sip it slow, sip it, sit back
Quit the chit chat, 'fore I grip that 4, and I lift your soul
When I lick that, go nigga go nigga...

[Hook]
Hi, ribbon up my mind, open up my eyes, realise this, and show me show, show me, one time (ay ay)
Ride, a lift in your ride, the look in your eyes, I like it
So won't ya show show me, one time? (ay ay)
