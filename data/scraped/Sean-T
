[Verse 1]
Guce nigga, back out of jail and still fiendin'
California dreamin' wild with Gators
Westside pullin' capers
Big boss when we push off the purple and sippin' on yac
Now I made ya bitch wanna be like how you act, I'm all that
Still hurtin' from the heart, from the block party to the park
I keep it real with my niggas from the start
They never came to see me
I'm steady bustin' like I stepped on these motherfuckers love me
Better guard ya silk dog, I got my wealth
The front cover of a murder dog, we all hogs
Spot full of cock, bitch niggas get blue balls
It's sick that you should fuck with a real West Coast nigga
Fuck that scrilla, imagine that
Real run around, we'll run around
Have you ever heard of a get paid G
Hoggin' ballin' they one piece to the streets, it's dir-ty
The police thinkin' they know about me and how I did it
They mad cause everything we talk about we did it
Pull a mob trifecta, soldiers ready to wreck ya
Bitch niggas that snitch or go to jail that mafia gonna get ya
Hitters with wigs, bustin' with zigs
We subject the closer we get
My holster to chest, ya left wet

[Verse 2]
I fuck with three hundred a week
I keep thuggin' and lovin' the shit that I speak
Hungry starvin' and searchin' lurkin' workin' for pops
Young nigga have us some big fat knots
Hate to be with or without it retaliate with ya plate in my hand
Now who's the man with the master plan
I dump, spin-off and get away with the quickness
Shot off ya mama's house, stole ya dope, fucked ya bitches
Ain't no thing to a boss
To be a boss a playa costs
To take from ya wrist and take a loss
I take and toss you toss it back
You don't wanna catch a heart attack
Bust, huss and get em' back, nigga

[Hook x2]
I thought you knew what we came fo'
Give up the money and the dough before ya brains blow
That's how it is, ain't no love in this biz
I did it all for a reason if so it would've never been did

[Verse 3]
Yeah we ghetto platinum so back up nigga we hot scorchin'
I'm in this game for strictly the fame and the fortune
We full force up in the rap industry so take caution
Man it's the Gamblaz and the DPG
With Guce Corleone so man I'm claimin' GOP
And ain't gon' ever stop my nigga we invest in this shit
Lyricals techs that get you wet when I spit it
Y'all nigga done did it y'all fuckin' with made niggas
We block mobsters and unstoppable we can't be beat
Y'all wanna see us nigga meet us on the street
At any time or place in beef you can't sleep
I'm the number one contender makin' y'all meet defeat[Verse 1-Daz]
See I'm in it just for wit it
And I'm in it for the long run
Hang out the window lil' lower just for fun
I catch it all of ratch get feeled get called up
The shit I spit how shit get caught up
Get rid crow bar before a person 14-5
The shit niggas gotta do try 2 get high
As time fly by so quick so fast
The dollars is big cash as I stacks my dash
I burn some hush wit some indo hang my rain out the window
Bullets flying just like missiles we the dawg
We mob type shit when we guiling we blast
As the job and then we dump him and slide him

Chorus: Daz

Its just the street life
Thats how we live as a kid
Hoes,in drop top benz, having major ends (x2)

[Verse 2-Telly Mac]
(Its just the street life)
We breakin' out no matter what we keep it high tech
Flossin' on some benjamin' shit ready to strike, Mah niggas bike it
C-B yours and all your babys all the homies is crazy poka face
Like Patrick Swayze
Burner glooves, black beanies they can't see me
America's nightmare white flags and treaty
Cause' dust this we can't trust us they busk us
Pimps and hustla's trapped in they clutchus

Chorus (x2)

[Verse 3-JT Da Bigga Figga]
We knew, (Its just the street life)
For real loc so you gotta hustla bitch make ends
Don't fuck with no fake friends, you ride until the end
You claim to be the realist but you came to pretend
Drink piss thought I was rich cause I was willin' in Benz
Rolls royces, and date weed feelin' the hen(hen)
And plus I rolls wit the squad drinkin' mob mend(mob mend)
And plus a thug niggas thugged out niggas ready to play hard
Pullin' your J-car still ridaz like Jay-R
Ready to bust like a A-R, hang wit the way 4
Leavin' anything movin' scarred, We Westcoast stars
Spittin' million dollar porno's for ours
Who the fuck wanna star not me I gotta get it
I represent it, still stick to getting riches
The world is endless nigga dis is how we livin'
The street life (thats how we live as a kid
Hoes,in drop top benz, having major ends)

Chorus (x2)

Fade to EndUhh, uhh, gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, it's gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, shit I'm livin gangsta gangsta shit
Yeah

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm from Compton, Compton, Murderville
You heard these niggas is gangsters, and they kill
Rob and steal, my niggas will peel at will
For real they real, niggas gon' feel this steel

[The Game]
Walk with me through the ghetto where the packs get sold
And them niggas sellin the work ain't half as old
As the fiends and the hippies, same ones smokin since the 60's
Everybody yellin gimme, gimme
Every nigga in the hood, one hand on his jimmy
Other hand grip the semi, c'mon walk with me
Every ten houses, one got 'caine for sale
And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell
And you can get that stainless steel
Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real
When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring
And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine
Keep a +Mac+ on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans
QB in the hood and I'm far from Queens
The boys in the hood is always hard
So come through and get smoked like a Cuban cigar

[Hook]

[The Game]
I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell
And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverand, a dime for a witness
Only +Church's+ in the hood sell chicken (ba-KAW)
Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses
You fuckin with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone
Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up
In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggas to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin about if y'all seen where..

[Hook]

[The Game]
We drug dealin, but niggas is squealin (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stooooooood?
I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood
Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggas ball, some niggas do what we do
And other niggas sing for Cash Money like TQ
The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin to get these jewels
I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2

[Hook]Uh, uh yeah uh
Just another one, just another one
Uh uh, check it

[Verse 1]
Never touch mine, breakin' ya hustle
Watchin' ya crumble over punk shit
Runnin' ya mouth, now you in trouble
Got ya whole click sittin' there hot
We at the spot
Feed the money counters into the block
And at the top is an old lady
Matchin' Mercedes, servin' her husband
Cause the homie's crazy
Bought up and drunken
Straight thuggin' and trees burn
Weed clouds get distributed
Eyes turn red palms sweat
When niggas hit the shit
The AC on, CD knockin' and it's the Gamblaz
Ghetto platinum, stuck in some shit
You know we handle em'
They still talkin' still hustlin' still musclin'
And takin' over, catchin' your queen
With no smugglin'
She told it all
Checkmate like Mac Mall
We all ball, we dogs
With no plaques on the wall
We independent on some other shit
Movin' them boxes
Cause it's cash on delivery
The safe in the closet
We still lovin' it

[Verse 2]
I wanna get riches, flip sixes, and own a condo
Blowin' Bom though cause the niggas is some smokers
In the Gamblaz shack with craps, and scraps for poker
We stock brokers, we trained just like Wall Street
I look at all my competition this war meets
The Gamblaz, we ghetto platinum and y'all weak
Though I sit back blow off Rap City all week
Seein' garbage ass rappers that think it's all sweet
It's deep, better watch the Gamblaz we on creep
The first to leap, get sweeped beneath the feet
Man I treat the world to million dollar rhymes and lines
About thugs movin' dimes and carryin' loaded nines
Fatal times and crimes keep fuckin' up my mind
I'm blind and still livin' life on the line
Read the line status, hits to hits in my defense
I don't wanna get penned to the fence and get rich
Everyboy say I'm takin' a risk to get rich
Tryin' to flip off a million dollar dissin' and shit
Splittin' sections to fractions, perhaps it's for actions
They got me bringin' pain like the tractions, what happened

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, yo
More money to get, O's to flip, hoes to break
Clockin' loot from state to state movin' major weight
Like cargo, breakin' em' off something hardcore
We all roll, to have big money is what we ball for
In and out of lanes countin' my cash
With a blunt on my lips and ounce of my stash
We bounce fast up the block, tuck the Glock then skat
Rockin' raps won't stop till my pockets fat
I'm out to profit in this game till my time is over
I spend my spare time hustlin' and grindin' doja
Fuck exposure just show me the cash up front
We mash punks and shoot lyrics like we blastin' pumps, what

[Verse 4]
Smoke, smoke, smoke till I can't smoke, smoke, smoke
I fucks a ho till she can't fuck no more
In it been gettin' it like lobster and shrimp
I don't know why I'm a hell of a pimp
I strive with a limp, flip the gift and get swifted
On my mama, I'm a fool I get with this
I don't admit, fuck all y'all ya crew's small
All the funky funky girls just ball
Flip my dick in her jaw, fuck the law
Diggy Daz the shit straight breakin' the law
Tell me, tell me, tell me who's number one
That nigga Daz, all these suckers get done

[Verse 5]
I been thugged out since day on, also pays to come
Dues been done paid, blocks been done sprayed
Ya whole click can't fade one nigga in my crew
Paper bound is what I represent cause money I pursue
I ain't takin' losses dog while niggas crossin' game
Live for money fuck fame and all my life I endure pain
I ain't no lame so don't try to play me for no jokes
Weed smoke and Hennessey got me easy to provoke
Turn to music top my folks, Vicky, Tera, Macy
I got it sowed from BK street to the A-V-E
And y'all hatin' me cause my riches steadily stackin'
I see ya whole crew standin' sold bushes out there with em'
Here we go like a phantom but I'm backboard tweezed
Me and the Fig and the Gamblaz flip to L-I-V-E
G-O-P bitch[Hook: repeat 2X]
Real gangstaz stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply cause I'm mad at you

[The Game]
Y'all niggas see me when I'm come through; and ain't no denyin
That them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin like the streets is mine
Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin mine
And I won't stop bustin 'til them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga

[Hook]

[The Game]
Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
That'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that
Niggas thinkin I retired my Chuck, put the gun back in the holsters
Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through
Droppin all y'all niggas with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with that pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up
Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggas next to each other how I do 'em in line

[Hook]

[The Game]
Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook then I'm bringin the chrome
If I die then I'm leavin a clone; but if I live
Through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig
When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey
And ain't nuttin to do a driveby in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'mma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it
Think this shit a joke? Bet the S-5 pink on it

[Hook]Yeah uh, let me speak on it (Yeah, yeah)
Like this

[Verse 1]
Livin' my life on the streets nigga, completely a hustle mission
It's do or die, no doubt we tryin' to get it nigga
Read about the slick Gambinos
Keepin' it locked on both sides of the globe, sunshine is no
It's kind of crazy in these streets
Where killers will grab the heat
Nigga listen to the shit that I speak
Y'all know the outcome, from Filmore to Third
It's crucial on every turf
They ride and skird off
Until the next day they plot and let the gats burst off
I've seen it with my own eyes
A witness to this sick life
Where niggas will kill to flip some vice
Or a Vette, Viper, or Lex to floss around the West
Shit I'm nothin' nice so out on these streets keep a vest

[Verse 2]
I'd rather ball than be on these streets hustlin' for mine
It's dirty out here so I'm only trustin' the nine
And I'm knownin' this money ain't worth my freedom
My homie caught a case back in 88 and ever since I ain't seen him
I live the life of crime, affiliated in this dangerous times
Where you either bangin' rhymes or sellin' dimes
And jail time ain't nothin' new to thugs
Movin' drugs, takin' it one time and duckin' slugs
Fuck the love cause it ain't none and never will be
Ya shake my hand call me ya man but probably wanna kill me
I still be one of the realest to spill it
And all that shit that you talkin' about doin' I been did it

[Hook x2]
This is playin' hard, involved in the streets
Bailin' from bars, street stars playin' for keeps
Bullin' pants saggin' straps under the seat
Hustlin' instead of gettin' caught in all the beef

[Verse 3]
I stay tucked on my way to the block
The gunshots keep the turf on hot
Crack rocks and fat knocks
All the homies in the jeans ya tryin' to get it
Better keep ya cabbage man them niggas be tryin' to split it
Dirty ones, dirty thugs and then niggas
Head full of drama and everybody wants vengence
Smokin' on blunts and conversatin' over E's
Sippin' on Seagrams cup and plottin' on some G's
Moves get mad, crews get sprayed and the bodies get left
Every fuckin' move you make you gotta watch ya step
And the streets is like a time bomb, know the facts
Never speak business about murders and pullin' jacks
With the shake of the dice you ballin' or either broke
If ya stay in the drama might live or get smoked
Cause it's fifty-fifty, laugh now cry later
And funkin' is for keeps and they comin' back with the sprayer

[Verse 4]
It gets low, we keep it locked until we sittin' on top
But I'm the chief of the squad, callin' shots
It's nineteen-ninety fever
It's Tha Commissiona, representin' the Gamblaz
But confidentialy we goin' platinum
We feel the truth until the world listen up to hear the real
Cause it's for certain we keepin' it locked and holdin' it down
It's definetly not a get rich quick scheme
That's official, it's our time to shine we takin' over
It's one of the many, I'm playin' by my own rules
Constantly I'm tryin' to stick and move
Avoidin' the block, providin' for the rest of the fam
And I'm a made man
That's why I'm tryin' to execute this major, master plan

[Hook x4][Verse 1]
You niggas is half pipes, get zero and a half mics
I'm on red eyed flights, tryin' to get shit right
Partners gettin' killed by each other it makes no dollars
It makes no sense that we can't holler
Like to test game, yeah niggas is pawns
Just pieces to the puzzle that'll never respond
We blow Bom by the pound
Seventeen reasons to have seventeen rounds
Might have to down some clowns
Try to get around the shit
If I gotta sell dope nigga, I'm tryin' to flip a thousand bricks
So I can stop the bullshit, we can count some chips
Try to buy our way out this shit

[Hook]
Think smart not hard, don't drop ya guard
Think smart not hard, don't drop ya guard
Think smart not hard, don't drop ya guard
You can have cars, bitches, houses, women
Think smart not hard, never drop ya guard
Think smart not hard, never drop ya guard
Think smart not hard, never drop ya guard
You can have cars, bitches, houses, women

[Verse 2]
Every day I sit and think how I'ma make things better
Constantly flip and zip a stack of dope, gettin' my cheddar
You know the basics, tryin' to be mobbed out and famous
And I'm already livin' a life that's dangerous, fresh hall-of-famers
That's why a nigga don't fuck with strangers, I stay G'd up
And I'm serious about my fetti, don't make me go an and kill sweeper
Them niggas don't wanna see us, that's what them haters holler
But I'm tell ya boy this neighborhood something like Mr. Rogers
Niggas wanna be hard and niggas wanna have riches
Niggas wanna have cars and niggas wanna have bitches
That's why I stick to the script, I stand tall and do a lot
Make smurk play my part and ain't gon' let my guard fall, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nothin' to laugh about, something to smash about
You won't make it to the top if you have doubts
A half bounce, get wins takin' losses
Snakes come across us
I slice they necks with di-a-lect
Ride for self, that's out M-O
In the M-O-E where we trip on something little
Niggas losin' they mind, goin' broke losin' they grind
Goin' soft and square and combine
Behind the times, nigga you need to catch up
Stackin' paper to the ceiling is how you rep up
Creep up from the bottom tryin' to reach the top
Fuck the hate, ya squares need to learn a lot
You can get ya face cracked and ya can't replace that
I was on the wrong path, made it to the straight track
Tryin' to ride something fat like sweater
G-O-P, C-D-P no one can do it better

[Hook][Hook: The Game + JT]
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles

[JT the Bigga Figga]
They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V.I.P
Street smarts is crucial for young niggas in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin twice this way
Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the {?} name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga

[Hook]

[The Game]
I got guns, guns, guns, guns
Guns all over the club
We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggas don't want beef with me
Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin to the sound of the Game and JT

[Hook]

[JT the Bigga Figga]
But you can't come with the rest of her friends
Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends
Make rounds from the back of the Benz
With the {?} that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend
The things we go through I'm beatin ya brains
Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game
While they knockin on the do' I get deep in ya dame
Gotta charge you a G just for speakin my name

[The Game]
I'm not eatin your chocha or payin for the coach ma
I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma
6 in the mornin, you stretchin on the sofa
Singin "Ain't No Nigga" like Foxy Brown and Hova
I fuck 'em dogstyle with Billys and Novas
With or without chaffeurs, I make 'em fuck the both of us
You know what it is, the gangster's back
And I keep my banger at where my chain hang at
I'm ghetto

[Hook] - 2X[Hook ×2]
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't...

[Verse 1: The Game]
Amayah wake up baby
I know you're sleepin, but daddy's home now
Pictures gettin old, my lil' girl lookin grown now
Your moms said you're talkin on your own, walkin on your own now
Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers
I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin
Smilin at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin
God how can somethin so beautiful come from me?
After the gunshots thought you was done with me
But I know I'm livin now, why you made me put the guns down
Pick up the mic, start rappin for a living now
My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth
My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay
Tryin to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin
I know she love me cause ya look just like me
Day you came into this world I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here

[Hook  ×2]

[Verse 2: Blue Chip]
Yo, yo, you see this rap shit I do it for you
And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now, cuttin the game, stoppin the bullshit
Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick
Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son
My girl moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard
Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar
Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga
Takin your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms, that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it
Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song, don't cry

[Hook  ×2]

[Verse 2: The Game & Blue Chip]

[Game]
Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'mma let your moms school you
Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin to you

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, you see these niggas out here, have you stressin by the hour
Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards

[The Game]
Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together
The world is ours, and you're my flower

[Blue Chip]
If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that
Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback

[The Game]
And I ain't sayin sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar

[The Game]
And I will leave you with this, my lil' angel, daddy loves you
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, switchin handles like you breakin a zone, candy paint Impala
On the Golden Bridge, bouncin on chrome

[Hook ×2][19 second instrumental to open]

[The Game]
Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters
Got niggers' trying to 'Kiss the Game Goodbye' like Jada
Get your shit pushed back like Jada's CD
I'll put your brains on that Kenwood TV
So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog
And the Game behind the Desert is a nightmare dog
If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog
I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on
Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know
If 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet
But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs
Got niggas Harlem Shakin like the new G. Dep
Tryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet
Better have that Glock stuffed tonight
I'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it
A block bust tonight

[Hook 2X: The Game]
Getting American Money Easy, all I know
The Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough
It's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out
Shots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts

[The Game]
Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain
The more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggas ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggas die for this
The Game the reason all these niggas on that "Cali Love" shit
Compton niggas get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Comin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

[Hook]

[Young Noble]
Aiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointin fingers at them niggas, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out
Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there
N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese
I got niggas out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggas out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass
For a long time if you ever fuckin with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud
We killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard
You the type of motherfucker standin next to the God
The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets
Young Noble and the homey Game flamin heat, c'mon

[Hook][The Game]
I'm from Compton where them guns bust, watch Poppa George pop
Cats tellin jokes at them car games
Seen big face hundreds, handle the rock like Nate Archibald
What?  This nigga only sixteen
And I wanted to be, just like him, middle school fightin
Any nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?
You want beef with me?  Now I let the heat speak for me
No more talkin, just outline chalkin
Nigga Witta Attitude from birth, "100 Miles and Running"
Gunnin bustin shots like fuck the cops
Notorious for burnin blocks, weavin in and out of traffic and chop
Game the young Robin Hood of the block
Steal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggas rock
Second comin of this black Alfred Hitchcock
Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
Ten shots to your spleen, let them violins sing

[Hook: Blue Chip] + (The Game)
Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game, young'uns runnin with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin the game
When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man
(And I look good, from Compton to Brooklyn)
Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure
(Dead presidents is all I represent)
('Til y'all met me y'all niggas ain't met gangsta yet)

[The Game]
Fast cars, money and muscle, the hustle I was brought up in the 80's
Gangbangin, dope traffic, shit get crazy
From where niggas grow up hard like dicks raised
Them hustlin guns like Knicks players, we got mouths to feed
'Til they put flowers on me, moms kiss my cold cheek
In that pine box, I'm buyin rocks, eyein cops
Fuck a cell block, the young kid makin it happen
Who you think got them fiends runnin back like Bo Jackson?
I'm a gangsta, what else could I say?
I'm ahead of myself like it's Y4K
2Pac, Scarface, N.W.A
Taught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play
Keep fo' snug in the waist or pay a thousand to have 'em
Niggas in the street move faster than, Michael Jackson's album
But the shit don't really matter to me, we get better G
Bet the four slow 'em down like PCP

[Hook]

[The Game]
Real gangsters never talk shit, handle they business
Fuck the dry snitchin and bitchin, niggas die when them bullets fly
Who fuckin with him, ha?  Not a nigga alive
End up dead in that 5
He got no sympathy for them dead guys, friend or foe
Watch that chest cave in, what that vest savin?
Make it sloppy for the autopsy, leave my enemies in a frenzy
On the frontlines holdin a 9
Everyday a new chapter, my own niggas plottin on me
Tryin to hit me but they won't get me, feel the semi first
Fuckin with my dough, is the worst way to go
Y'all know, niggas cry when them bullets burn slow dummy
In and out of spots watchin my money
If one dollar come up missin bodies start to come up missin
No one too heavy for the Expedition, piss on your corpse
Watch your soul shiver, throw him in the river, bitch nigga

[Hook][Hook: repeat 2X]
Real gangstaz stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply cause I'm mad at you

[The Game]
Y'all niggas see me when I'm come through; and ain't no denyin
That them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin like the streets is mine
Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin mine
And I won't stop bustin 'til them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga

[Hook]

[The Game]
Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
That'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that
Niggas thinkin I retired my Chuck, put the gun back in the holsters
Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through
Droppin all y'all niggas with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with that pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up
Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggas next to each other how I do 'em in line

[Hook]

[The Game]
Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook then I'm bringin the chrome
If I die then I'm leavin a clone; but if I live
Through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig
When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey
And ain't nuttin to do a driveby in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'mma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it
Think this shit a joke? Bet the S-5 pink on it

[Hook][Intro: Trae]
You know
I never did understand why they always told me to smile
Shit
It ain't too much shit I gave a smile for
Real talk
Yo still a asshole by nature
Peep game

[Verse 1: Trae]
I remember comin' up able to love nigga watchin' niggas fuck over
They over sea I kept it reala
But bein' real ain't really always what niggas make it to be
I never thought we'd make it and I'd have niggas hatin' a G
I got enough shit that I deal with on the day to day
Penitentiary's the life after death don't seem to go away
Even though I never know the outcomes it's always safe to pray
And try to do my best to understand he write a rhyme away
I got a call from Mr. Rogers just the other day tellin' me he by my side
I'm like what the fuck you talkin' 'bout 'til he told me Lorna died
It fucked me up so much I couldn't even go to the wake
But if her family called I'm gon' make sure that they straight
It's like this part of my life I live is damn near mastered
The more people I love the more they get took away faster
Sometimes I feel I talk to God a lil more than the pastor
Prob'ly been livin' to make sure my son never become a bastard
I've never been the one to quit I've always been the leader
But I feel this world is like a bitch and I know I don't need her
If I ever had this I never took the time to meet her
So I feel a frown across my face the only way to greet her
In the process of bein' Trae I missed out as a child
Prob'ly cuz reality must stop
And they told my cousin death before he thirty after checkin' his pile
He damn near 28 so how the fuck am I supposed to smile shit

[Styles P]
I don't know my nigga
I ask myself the same shit everyday
How the fuck am I supposed to smile
Life's real over here though
Y'know

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Styles don't smile
The hood too foul
The lil niggas is wild
Men lost trial
Hit 'em with some numbers he ain't eatin' doin' chow
He ain't even sleepin' he been thinkin' 'bout his child
It's real fucked up but he won't see him for a while
Same bullshit try'na get you a money pile
You don't see the reefer or the jail doors locked
I keep a tech with the air holes cocked
Now I don't wanna shoot or get shot
But Pinero's not
Gon' fuck with these fuck niggas or air those Lox
It's real hard to sleep when its money on the mind and
Murder on the mind
Puffin' on the dutch with a fist full of iron
Somebody mom cryin' cuz somebody boy dyin'
It's the same ol' shit
Wait till the funeral
Same ol' trip
Crack money rap money
The same ol' grip
As Trae could've smiled out in Texas
Livin' reckless
If the cops gon' get you but niggas'll leave you breathless
Shit I'm a winner
More like a sinner
Try'na make it to dinner
Then live after breakfast
Y'know

[Styles P]
Trae
S.P
How the fuck are we suppose to smile
Man
Answer me that
Maybe I'll fuckin' smile
Y'know

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Nothin' to smile about
These lil niggas is wildin' out
Do somethin' to 'em they dialin' out
Everybody lookin' at you like you foulin' out
Every hood everywhere that's what it's now about
The shootas is half your age
Give you half the gage
Daily news half the page
Known as a thug now he ain't just fly
Couple months in the group home in DFY
Truthfully what could have been pended but never did
And he slid
As a youthful offender cuz he's a kid
Problem is
The person he shot was connected
He comin' home thinkin' he's sweet and don't expect it
Big but he's still young
To him it's still fun
360 waves new gear blue steel gun
They say you ain't promised tomorrow
They got the drop and hit him right in his head with a hollow[20 second instrumental to open]

[The Game]
Who really the best rapper since 'Pac got killed
I done answered that question when I copped my deal
Ask yourself when the Game is comin, after next summer
I predict my shit'll drop before the next Howard homecoming
Now who in the runnin, no one, ask the niggas who want it
I got a four-fifth and it just like me, it stay gunnin
Me and my niggas stay blunted fogged up in the 600
Guilty as charged, blunts in the air, guns in the doors
It's written, Compton niggas never run from the law
Plus we get Monopoly money with hotels and a board
So I'll never see a jail, and I'm allergic to bars
Can't sit behind 'em or drink at 'em, so we travel with ours
Poppin Crist' in the 6, like we drivin through Mardi Gras
Thinkin 'bout beads and titties as I roll through the city
And I keep 16 in the clip, and I let 'em all go
Like the Lakers did Ellie, Atty and Nick, huh

[Hook]
When shit get thick, niggas start dyin
Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga
We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent, cause
When shit get thick, niggas start dyin
Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga
We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent

[Sean T]
No garbage, we smoke molta, move big cocoa
We off the train tracks like the great space coaster
We hit real big and consistant like Sam Sosa
Prepare for war, like United States soldiers
Lock tight and rock right like grey eight oz's
I'll be hittin up spots, in them flip Range Rovers
Before you even try to play, foolish all over
Empty out yo' pockets, turn everything over
We ball out cursin yeah we keep it the sickest
When we roll by the quads in them Z-66's
Big spittin, grip kitten, that big face greed
Always dirty never clean but we live like kings
Legendary like Sting, it's a history to follow
But not known for stingin known for gettin off hollows
Shoot me a glass of Remy, nah fuck it the whole bottle
And watch me act bad and take off, full throttle

[Hook]

[JT the Bigga Figga]
I'm from a batch where it ain't no cut, we all in
36 on a triple beam scale for meal
Duffle bag on my shoulder my route, through the back of the jet
To bag up baguettes and everybody know it
I'm the iceholder makin the cut, never breakin 'em up
My favorite color is rainbowed up
Ain't a coke dealer, but I got bricks for cheap
Hit the lab for a fo' day block, we got heat
You niggas can't compete when I walk in the streets
We Get Low, and there's no idea with the info
It's a rule of thumb, let them dudes a come
I'm cruisin some, 20 inch shoes and some
I'm in the widebody XM-5, all my snakes is live
We check your five, the spot where the tec dies
And everybody gotta holla the name
It's JT from the Fillmoe streets to CPT[The Game]
Who the illest hub dawg you know
Peelin slugs at your mug, dealin drugs in front of the projects
My projects, more scatter, more street
Makin room for more drama, more hustle, more heat
I can show you how to get, American money easy
It's the gangster, all motherfuckers envy
Leave all semi I tote, clips empty
Foes tempt me, I'm seein no penitentiary
Crime scene clean, shells, no prints
Flee the shootout, X-5, no {?}
It's meant for me to survive this gangster shit
Meant for you not to be livin, food for the pigeons
It's rules I'm givin, new lessons for the street
This jungle I'm from B don't breed no weak
Lames that don't know the game please don't speak
You get killed, want me peeled, I'm showin no {?} nigga

[Hook: The Game] + (Sean T)
Every nigga out there claimin to be the illest
I don't know if y'all know let a nigga know I'm lost in the stipulations
Niggas hatin, everybody waitin for the outcome
Whatever happened to just to rappin?
(Mic graspin, freestyle flow flashin)
(Rippin up tracks and, doin the thang)
(What'chu niggas know about Sean T and the Game?)
(Who's the illest?)

[Sean T]
I'm off the rack like slabs of ribs, I want it big
I ain't fuckin with kids, I'm after six digit things
Fuck the rings and the tribulations, constant playa hatin
This crimin-al lifestyle, keeps me animatin
Let's turf talk before you niggas thuggin it up
It don't matter if you Crip'n, or Blood'n it up
Dallas Squad blooded it up, smashin on sight
But he hoppin on haters like BMX bikes
Fuck around with the Squad see unbearable sights
We takin gangster shit to the maximum height
But I'm mainly into bubblin, fat grip doublin
Big heads I'm lovin 'em, you feelin me y'all
Leavin the envious in awe cause I tremendously ball
I'm supported by the Game so you know I won't fall
I'ma execute my options, keep wettin my paws
And come out unscathed with no scratches or flaws
Who's the illest

[Hook]

[The Game]
They say "Game, you rappin like you from the East coast," meet toast
Gun jammed in your throat, forgot that you spoke
Game got the streets woke young'n, same nigga got the coke runnin
Introduce the new fiends to smack
Pops told me when I was younger, you can't live like that
So I don't listen to pops nigga I listen to Kool G. Rap
Went from hustlin sacks to heavy weight, shufflin crack
Kids and preachers know me, young Game the O.G
Ask the reverand kept the church from fallin, young'uns from starvin
I'm the project like Marcy or the Nickerson Gardens
Comfortable dawg, Compton to Harlem, any city ghetto or hood
Kick back, blowin, listen to Marvin
Get head, count dough and just sit in the apartment
AK in the sofa, I'm the illest, who come closer
To the late ones or great ones fightin over a crown
Get shot off that throne, who the illest now, huh?

[Hook]

[Sean T]
Some say the gangster mentality is dead, imagine that
When fools pullin straps out with infrared
We're livin in a time of plagues and corrupt life
When homies in the circle end up all trife
Tryin to shine bright, but lookin all dim
Meanwhile I stay sharp like a ballpoint pen
I see the smirks and grins but I just laugh
Cause I'm gettin lucrative loot, endless math
If you only knew the half of it, you wouldn't hate
But niggas just pig and talk shit behind Jake
Man you cain't knock the hustle, I ain't fin' to be greedy
I want an exit out the game kinda like Paul Vitti
I'm tryin to slang CD's in cruise control
Instead of sellin illegal pharmaceuticals
Should I ask for your advice?  Like you would know
Fuck it, I'm out to get it, I'm a fool for dough

[Hook][ VERSE 1: JT The Bigga Figga ]
We play hardball, runnin these streets in different routes
Make the paper count, stuffed in the couch, we got clout
All I talk about is cheddar-chasin, we in the Jets
In a parking lot in a bubble goose rockin a vest
So we mean-muggin, whole trunk full of goodies
Burner gloves, Timbos, Levis and the hoodies
I'm in and out of B-210, juice & gin
Crack the window when you smokin them bidi's, pass the Hen
Overdrive in the passenger side, my niggas ride
For the westside, 415, ????
By the look in his eyes, you never been around the block though
Bustin off rounds or crack dealin to keep it hot tough
Dancin with the shift, get skirtin, illegal motion
Stoppin for the cops and it's curtains, so keep coastin
When they dust for prints ain't no punks in this
And if they ever bring the drama get the pumps for this

[ Chorus: Cosmo ]
We ain't got shit to lose but much to gain
We young thugs who done felt much pain
Drug dealers who touched caine
Stuck in the game like 'fuck fame'
Makin weak cats tuck they chains
Ain't nothin changed

[ VERSE 2: Killa Tay ]
I serve a punk quick like Serena and Venus
Foul language, broken English, but my style's the cleanest
I was born on the East but I reside on the West
Officially Supernatural, so I ride to the death
Express my plans to my fans, put my spirit in lyrics
Eternal threats after a mic check, let the whole world hear it
They call me Mister Mafioso, the one and only
Runnin a mob, gettin the job done, no love for the phoneys
I'm representin WCM to the fullest, my nigga
Pullin strings like a trigger, posted up with the stigma
I lay my hat somewhere in ???? protectin my family
My homies ain't understandin me cause they live in a fantasy
I got deep ties and I'll keep wise, respect from the West to the Eastside
These gees ride just to put it down in my British Knights and my Levis
But now we all O.G., livin casual, ready to travel
Ain't no equal to this God Mob crew, who wanna battle?

[ Chorus: Cosmo ]

[ VERSE 3: Cosmo ]
We livin in the last days where gats spray
Hittin cats from blocks away
Crooked cops tryin to stop the pay
They think we rockin lley
Tryin to monitor the ways that we operate
Cause we won't cooperate
We stay large, we break jawbones and get our ball on
On the block hustlin dope till it's all gone
I'm almost all grown, I got a .380 Beretta and it's all chrome
I know I'm all wrong for all the thug livin and drug dealin
I put my ears to the streets but all I'm hearin is these slugs peelin
When they come killin ain't no words fo'
All you seein is beanies, black pistols and herb smoke
Dirty money wrapped in rubberbands
Young killas dyin over scrilla, I heard he went out over a hundred grand
Penitentiary cells blocks
Is full of young thugs who ain't got no choice but to sell rocks
I know my future was planned for me to succeed
I'd die to see my homie G-Spot and mama live free
A lotta suckers wanna get me, plottin on seein me
Dead, got they Glocks aimed for my kidneys

[ Chorus: Cosmo ][Verse 1]
Sittin' fat on twenty inches, yeah and kickin' the flow
I used to be in the corner on my five point toes
Wrote raps with meaning, flashback to my younger days
In the summer, wanted her number but then she turned away
She turned the channel see my face on the screen
Now she havin' visions about replacin' my queen
Brought up the cream but she wouldn't see a nickel see a track
With comps on the big in the middle
Tryin' to fit em' now because of my fame
Y'all need support keep lovin' the name
Pushin' the Range with a dot in the six
I'm heavy in the mixed and you coughed on my tit

[Hook x4]
We balled out, we grind out, we shined out
And when you see me on the tv then you find out

[Verse 2]
What they know about court life, locked down on titaniums
Saved a pocket full of them yays because they payin' em'
That's nothin' balled out shined out we big timin' on some other shit
Collectin' them faces they fit us fine
It's no surprise we pullin' up in the best
All leather with the wood grain rest, nothin' less
Confess we used to solve it all but gangstas know who we are
Playstation it's connect in each and every car
Gold teeth and French braids or the full fades
Bring it all together and bibble cause we all paid
Over-nighters on airplanes get the red-eye
Face to face negotiations and we keep it better
Now dig this, you say you wanna get the cheddar
Face to face negotiations and we keep it better
And all money ain't good money
You can't tell on the streets we determined to make mail

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Shhh, I get with it no problem, hundred G's I got em'
Five hundred Benz on twenty lone pros and drop em'
Livin' life me and my wife sittin' on the hill and we plush
Hey never enough and enough ain't enough
I bubble up and flip my fetti and double up
Like automatics and gauges and tech nigga is what's up, ha
I bring nothin' but that Southern Cali, Northern Cali gangbang
Mentality, so when you try to come battle me
Hit the game up with diamonds, you love the way they be shinin'
And I keep on grindin' that's when the 4-5 blindin'
Worried and nervous and nervous as fuck
I ai't got no license I ain't givin' a fuck
If you ain't got no money stay the fuck away from us
You see me in my Caddy lookin' clean as fuck

[Hook x4]Uhh, uhh, gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, it's gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, shit I'm livin gangsta gangsta shit
Yeah

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm from Compton, Compton, Murderville
You heard these niggas is gangsters, and they kill
Rob and steal, my niggas will peel at will
For real they real, niggas gon' feel this steel

[The Game]
Walk with me through the ghetto where the packs get sold
And them niggas sellin the work ain't half as old
As the fiends and the hippies, same ones smokin since the 60's
Everybody yellin gimme, gimme
Every nigga in the hood, one hand on his jimmy
Other hand grip the semi, c'mon walk with me
Every ten houses, one got 'caine for sale
And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell
And you can get that stainless steel
Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real
When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring
And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine
Keep a +Mac+ on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans
QB in the hood and I'm far from Queens
The boys in the hood is always hard
So come through and get smoked like a Cuban cigar

[Hook]

[The Game]
I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell
And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverand, a dime for a witness
Only +Church's+ in the hood sell chicken (ba-KAW)
Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses
You fuckin with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone
Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up
In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggas to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin about if y'all seen where..

[Hook]

[The Game]
We drug dealin, but niggas is squealin (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stooooooood?
I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood
Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggas ball, some niggas do what we do
And other niggas sing for Cash Money like TQ
The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin to get these jewels
I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2

[Hook][20 second instrumental to open]

[San Quinn]
Drama is real, like not wakin up
I'm breakin up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
If you kill it no more standin on that corner like a stop sign
Everytime you spotted they call it shot time
Not at the gym but in the grim reaper's hands
You important if a bullet hits, injure your plans
This is not an adventure, but a full-time duty
If you seen how niggas hit the club, they pullin out uzis
Sometimes bruisin and grazin, mostly takin
No more sleep for the shooter, no more of that hangin
No mo' trustin hoes you ain't know fo' ten plus
No mo' smokin with the homies, no mo' late night clubs
Cause the victim, is ready to stick him like a mousetrap
I'm 'bout to rap, you better be 'bout peepin out cash

[Hook: The Game]
If there's blood on my Nikes I done murdered a nigga
If the stash spot smokin I done murdered a nigga
San Quinn got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggas
We take this beef shit further than niggas
Streets are shady, the Game got curtains for niggas
All-of-a-sudden-ass killers never heard of these niggas
Have your whole family cryin a river, we'll murder you niggas
We take this beef shit personal nigga

[The Game]
I ain't met a nigga yet could fuck with this rap vet
I'm the realest since I came in the game on Kam back
Rest in peace to Mausberg, gotta live with that
Keep the M2 on my hip, I live with that
Eat with that, sleep with that, come get me
Four-fifty put somethin through your son Easter basket
Six in your truck, get you each a casket
Put termites in your box let 'em eat your cabbage
A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic
Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active
If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes
But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic
Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail
Cops on the payroll so me and Quinn live well
And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well
Shotgun got mo' punks than shells

[Hook]

[The Game]
See the Escalade got 'em runnin downhill, snowball niggas
We throw vapors out of truck windows, blow our figures
Suede corners out the sunroof, the fifth or the Ruger
Broad daylight, blow the windows out of your Cougar
Move in the S5, plus my, leather dust fly
Spark up a dutch, Game put niggas in a coffin too much
Turn niggas kids into orphans too much, In God We Trust - nah
Keep the fifth close like Starsky & Hutch
Your daughter cryin it's just {?} tuck, but so what
Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts
Have you eatin soup for months, broken jaw, lick your shit out of straws
I guess I got that same ol' harm
I ain't for play, the Game is raw
Specialize in death jackets, here try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese cause if you owe me
Guns O-U-T, we all gon' squeeze

[Hook][13 second street fight instrumental to open]

[The Game]
Death before dishonor
Ride with weap' up, cause niggas tryin to dent my armor
Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
Could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
Cause I play for the Bucks, and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back, like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

[Hook - repeat 2X]
Steppin out of Chevies with heat that's heavy - that's president
Bullets flyin for them dead guys - that's president
Led meltin inside your wig - that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin - it's all president

[Telly Mac]
Aiyyo I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block
High-tech collaborations with the Gamblaz and Blacksox
Drillin 'em killin 'em if we ain't feelin 'em nigga
If Sticky Fingaz need some music straight stealin it nigga
Shinin, in big trucks, big will in it nigga we climbin
To the top and we sealin it nigga
So back the fuck up, my niggas act the fuck up
So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the fuck up
Jacked the fuck up, beat up bad and clapped the fuck up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line, and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin
Roll in 600's, Beemers and 'llacs
We a team of cats, with the pens and gats
That fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached
We fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached

[Hook]

[The Game]
It's Telly and young Game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin
Lle or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop

[Telly Mac]
I'll stay in the spot, wearin a crop and coppin ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth

[The Game]
And you don't want it when the stainless out, what the game about
The bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggas can't stop us dawg

[Telly Mac]
So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards and y'all really the niggas that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that

[Hook] - to fade w/ Digital Underground ad libs[21 seconds of ad libs to open]

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Exclusively, ridin on them deuces G
Talkin 'bout what your gameplan used to be
They got us choppin up game through the fog and smoke
We came a long way but still we got so far to go

[Verse One]
Yeah I know I got 4 to go, so with these bars I flow
At a pace for the papes I thank y'all should know
I lace it properly for property, it really ain't no stoppin me
And plus I'm tryin to get my money on like Monopoly
Politickin economy, if I could be a made nigga
Smokin on e'ry nigga, balled out paid nigga
Keepin it real, I'm still deep in the field
Deep with the skills for the bills
I got the million dollar mouthpiece with no gold grill
I bring the thrill like Will Clark
I will bust I will spark and flame in the booth
You blind you shoulda saw it when I came in the booth
I serve the thunder, that shit that'll brang in the roof

[Verse Two]
My niggas, stack riches, mack bitches
Blow fast Swishers with my folks, act vicious with my folks
Sav livin with my vo-cals, Outlaw like my nigga No-ble
Fuckin bad bitches at the hotel
There's nothin to a boss, man we live it up
Smash for the cash and respect so when we mash niggas give it up
I got no time for that fake shit
Jersey to the Bay niggas thuggin even bitches thinkin they sick
So nigga basically the world is a ghetto
Play a nigga out his scratch, he gon' be twirled in a meadow
I keep it real with niggas that be true to me
There's nothin you can do to me
My crew is deep and real niggas rule the streets

[Hook]

[Verse Three: The Game]
Lace your Timbs, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the desert, if you a gangster or not
I give a fuck dawg, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit
The more pain the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggas ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggas die for this
The Game the reason all these niggas on that "Cali Love" shit
Compton niggas get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Pull it hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

[Verse Four]
It's time for me to shine, life on the grind, life on the line
Feelin like I'm runnin out of time
It's now or never, chasin this cheddar 'til things get better
These streets got me hungry as ever
Can't stop can't change, young Sav stuck in the game
Everyday we gotta hustle and slang, struggle and strain
To bubble, weed plus the 'caine to juggle
Organize the brains and muscle

[Hook]

[Verse Five]
You {?} like Sammy did Gotti, told 'em we kamikaze
Like those whiteboys ain't heedin the robbery
Told 'em we ride around in them cars on them big wheels
In the killing field makin 100 bills on the P-700 Pirelli wheels
Marshall Faulk in to ball again in this day to day scrimmage
'Bout the spinach this game is relentless where we livin
Niggas'll 32 round ya, kick you on the ground
After they down ya, sneak ya and plot ya, Heckler & Koch ya
Got ya body bein scrutinized by a flock of doctors
Still an unsolved mystery, statistically, history
A Get Low nigga victory by fuckin with my credibility[Verse 1]
They say they want me locked up or dead in the dirt
They got me ballin' spendin' dollars tryin' to get me off erk
Cause me and my cold click we come real shit, we got to work
And money ain't a thing, we dealin' with change and them first
And at the worst can get I lost a punk bitch
I dumped that the folks tryin' to get at some bullshit
Who said we gay, who said us niggas don't play
Menace City and the PB niggas is a un-soft case
And if ya niggas got something to say
Bitch ass niggas we don't play
Say it in my face, if it's negative talk game
And positively I let the Glock ring man
We don't bang, we get bitch niggas out the lane
Before the next motherfuckin' lane cross game
Or try to sprinkle salt on these young niggas name
That's why we makin' a statement, fuck everything

[Hook x2]
In Fillmoe, Fillmoe we don't play
Fillmoe it goes down every day
In Fillmoe, where every man stacks pay
Fillmoe, only the strong survive man

[Verse 2]
It's time for action, my main focus is only the stackin'
Stuck in this ghetto habitat without a way out
We ghetto platinum and no doubt ya get addicted to the street life
Hustlin' heavy tryin' to duck and dodge from three strikes
Caution cause niggas is shady from here to Boston
Sometimes flossin' talk shit behind ya back often
I spit the truth in every line that I speak
It's hard times nigga, get your's cause I'ma get mine completely
From city to city and coast to coast
We man-made ghetto stars that y'all bitches wanna toast to
Y'all can't even come close to, we larger than life
Don't dare to step up to this squad here, it's lonely after midnight

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
It's all hypee, knowin' these suckers never liked me
Rather see me in a jail cell with a federal indictment
Nigga, copyin' mafia on my own two
When I come through ride for the West, we all up on you
Ya whole crew, hate and despise when they look through the eyes
Of this real one, rushed through the dirt and pulled him out
And that's for real son
Never be at rest and that a lesson
When the beef hit and when ya get that ya get the blessin'
That's round talk, when shit get thick we see who sticks
And half of the click jump ship and straight split
Ice in the grip, they sell you out of yo location
Ya set back, wakin' ya up with home invasion

[Hook x2]Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Shit nobody knows, knows, knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
See nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
We got game for sale

[Verse 1]
How I do it, I put this spunk right into it
Act like I never knew ya, blast and run right through ya
Bust ya in the head with something
Bet ya my nigga we ain't playin'
Break the safe and start payin'
I got whatever ya need, big faces
For dollars I'm chasin' if I want it I take it
Ain't no mystery or no myth when I'm takin' ya shit
And you'll be history just dead in a ditch
Young Daz the assassin I hold it down for my crown
Huh, I lay it down for the whole Dogg Pound
How that sound, a nigga playin' me out
Ya get pound with no doubt we bustin' ya mouth
Young nigga

[Hook]
All I wanna do is put my hands on some dough
Reach in my pocket and everybody on the floor
See around my neighborhood nobody knows
What niggas might do to put they hands on some dough
All I wanna do is put my hands on some dough
Reach in my pocket and everybody on the floor

Peep game

[Verse 2]
On a street train pushin' my thoughts, we got hustle
For the right price hittin' the lab we got buckles
Tech notes, look at me slow with face won't
Project game travel to city
We take over ya mind frame
Do some things ya can't did
We made men, complete with cash ya can't spend
Mind balls, but not that mind ya used to
The new crew, hard knock life we too cool
We made that, we call strikes from way back
And take that, cell phone calls they can't track
Face slaps, see this shit from roof tops
When the drought here, can't outrun the two cops
The foot work spot and move we cop them dues
Keep the big face in they socks and shoes
Raised by old timers and laced with old game
Bait and switch partner and take the whole thing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey yo, hey yo
All I wanna do is put my hands on some Benjis
Drink Remy Martin until it's empty
Slap twenty-twos on the Bentley
It's niggas like you who been tryin' for centuries
We'll still touch em' like Ren and Stimpy
The train still rockin' big body Benzy in a frenzy
Pocket full of stones like Pimp C on ya ten speed
Don't tempt me, niggas layed up with the semi for ten G's
I'm simply rock for the block and penitentiaries
It's red dream shit and "Thug Lord" shit
Take them niggas to park quick, make em' forfeit
This the ayatollah, the number one spot holder
Glad ya Glock sewed up, take the rap and it's over
Told ya I'm the tightest motherfucker upon em'
Dustin' em' all and fuck y'all niggas suck balls
And I buck y'all with my niggas Ball and Daz dilly
Fingerprint the mac milli and slap his ass silly

[Verse 4]
I was a ho wet dream, a broke bitch nightmare
Serve her game before we start the affair
Mac usually never bless no squares
Suckers say yo prayers and have mine when I get there
Plus I use a M-5 for you to get yo live
Mr. Jesus ho gave yo about loot
Niggas bossin' for that chastity and game too
Cops dis and out front y'all few
That's out, so every motherfuckin' sentence count
I shook the game butt naked and made it work my route
Make my name taste like a Glock nine in ya mouth
Make a name, hang out with Roger Trout boss game, 535 stash
Independent and Mac owned, I leave the sahde trees alone
Man I'm about to have this shit sewn
Dillinger and Yuk and nigga now I'm three
Cut up and smash on they ass with no apology

[Verse 5]
I got heat for you niggas, speed for you niggas
Thought I couldn't come with official game
It ain't for play, I ain't playin'
Take the dollar squad name
I split duck and hit toke and take this to the brain
Fool I do the damn thing, I bust so tremendous
So what's at stake for those that fake and hate
Old niggas have to deal with little
Followin' fetti trails I head to the ghetto
Doin' dirt in the gritty ghetto
It's young T-Bone stackin' P
I bet a grand, standin' next to me is Samuel C
I'm Everclear a hundred proof and I'm hard to drink
My Ph is like ya throwin' a case
This game is for sale

Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Shit nobody knows, knows, knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
See nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
We got game for sale[Verse 1]
I'm from the home where the niggas push tapes out the trunk
And make movies with they lunch money filmin' out trucks
Independent rap movin' tapes like crack
Got em' hooked on this West Coast rap, we got stacks
Adapts and M-P-Cs and mic chords
Thug shit, something we on and fight for
Bring it all together and start with group ten
All the homies on the block is my distribution
Cheap for staff, keep the heat and cash
No matter the situation hit the gas and dash
We got it locked door, copped mo' niggas from the block so
You can't fuck with this, we got scripts

[Hook]
All I wanna do is put my hands on some dough
Reach in my pocket and everybody on the floor
See around my neighborhood nobody knows
What niggas might do to put they hands on some dough
All I wanna do is put my hands on some dough
Reach in my pocket and everybody on the floor

[Verse 2]
Show me right, I don't know whether rhyme or write
Then hit you with the shit ya don't like
Me and my nigga's game be trunk tight
We down to blast on sight
Hit a nigga with the infrared light
So when we see his family we know it's on on site
It don't matter, young nigga get down evry night
Holdin' bitch nigga wifey up for the right price
Give me a couple of cakes and I'll the bitch escape

[Verse 3]
All I wanna do is get rich, stack my chips
Slap a bitch if she think that shit sick
Only fuckin' with niggas that keep it real in the game
I ain't fuckin' with you suckers tryin' to hate on my name
It's simple and plain, I'm sick in the brain
Quick to explain, you know, I don't give a dang
I'ma ride this motherfucker till the wheels fall off
I'm a hustlin' bitch that can't take no loss

[Verse 4]
And it's Kurupt, the real close, nigga become ya folk
When ya fall out over dope money and coke money
Ain't shit funny, niggas kill for the quick money
It's real in the shady world of fake and falsey
Nigga don't dare to cross me I'm a jewel in the game
And you's a fool in the game without a tool in the game
End up catchin' a slug to the brain
I warned you once
Now them same niggas that's plottin'
Is them same niggas you smokin' blunts with
Hope you still while I'm sick of this shit
I spent a lot of nights tryin' to plant blunts for a lick
Couldn't go through with it cause of a guilty conscience
Many mobsters say they real but they really imposters
Money I don't got a lot of, a lot of
Get ya money and try to do right in the game
Ain't about to the gang
Walk up out of the game, we make mail nigga
For the right price we got game for sale nigga

[Hook](Verse 1)
(Killa Tay)
Whoever took the wrong path, 28 havin long cash
Tired of goin past my baby boy growin fast
Look in his eyes I know he ready to ride
With homicide on his mind cuz ain't no peace to find
I'm on the front line battlin demons with verbal weapons
With my heat release I see 'em runnin for protection
No question, I do the checkin with perfection
I stay clockin G's got the trees for the section
Incredible not, that nigga Sean T lace the beats
And now we comin with enough game to change the streets
And I ain't trippin off the fame it's all the same to me
I need my money cuz nothin in life came for free
I used to life the thug life and pack a chrome
Hustled 24/7 'till my sac was gone
Little kids on my block gettin blasted on
But it's a cold world baby and we all shady
White man tryin to tell me I'm crazy and lock me up
Got me fucked up with both hands cuffed
Feelin stuck, 'till my heartbeat cease I'm reppin C-Fold
Nothin to live for, so much to die for livin the life of a psycho

(The Commissiona)
Until I speak of the truth I feel a mil ticket's gettin closer
The Gambino's nigga we certified souljah's
I been laced in the game back in the late 80's
And now it's the year 2001
Some crucial on frontline, tryin to stay away from one time
Ridin off into the sunset
You taught your whole dealy and come to the game tryin to compete with us
Or ride with us we leavin niggas speechless
Speak in the heat of all speeches
We 30 deep in this game, we hustle hard and got G's to gain
Make a large amount of paper nigga larger than life
Behind this click nigga The Commissiona I got geez to get

(Chorus X2-JT The Bigga Figga)
I got geez to get, P's to flip
Turned off my phone cuz it's hot as a bitch
I know they watchin on the block but I couldn't beleive
When the homies try to tell on me

(Verse 2)
(Cosmo)
We makin moves, my team too strong we can't lose
Head up against the world take a walk in my shoes
And you gon' see why I act this way
Gettin Low with some real G's stackin the pay
I'm wakin up fresh off the flight, still hung over from last night
Nothin on my mind but the grind and gettin my cash right
And my vision, I got plots and plans for multimillions
So I can go cop a new Benz when I get the feelin
Makin a killin, off this here rap that I'm dealin
With my cash stacked up to the ceiling
I'm gettin money rockin more bottles and gold lynch to hang to my balls
Dip in act flip stacks to pay for my dogs
That got lost in this cold life
I got tired of workin cold nights and hangin on the block with no fight
I'm thinkin that I might get, slapped and jacked
Facin 25 to a L what type of life is that
I know the shit wasn't meant for me
I'm Young Pachino born floss on you bitches, ballin with Gambino's
Who got nothin to lose
Grabbin my dick, flippin off the world clutchin my tools, make ya lose

(JT The Bigga Figga)
This California lifestyle was dope by the Pound
My nigga wild when it's high profile
We through the aisles, checkin for Beamer's and Benz's
Searcher in this, for the right one took a strike 'em it's kinda nice son
Cuz we the tight ones, collar poppin to get the pesos
Sacks of dego, stack the cheddar just like the Lego
About to take ov'
We need to reach for your profile and, platinum medallion
Steppin out spaceships with stallions
Next turn your eyes glance up at the bosses
Niggas is cautious, of these hataz they see us flossin
Camouflage my souljah's sit in a garage
Tinted, my niggas in it with 2 more guys
I got the mind of a hustler, a tongue of a pimp
Keep my mind on my money gotta ride for the click
We certified from the rap game known to keep it crack game
West Coast Mafia nigga sittin on stacks mayn

(Chorus X4-JT The Bigga Figga)
I got geez to get, P's to flip
Turned off my phone cuz it's hot as a bitch
I know they watchin on the block but I couldn't beleive
When the homies try to tell on me[Intro]
(We gangsta daddy!)

[Verse 1: Sean T]
(Yuh!)
I'm sippin on that 'notiq the color of Hulk man
And the blueberry smoke got a nigga twerkin
You niggas is perkin - so you doin it big?
You roll deep but when I see you it's just you and your kids
I roll sick, my rims feel like helicopter propellers
And my pockets run deep like a Mercer teller
Haters trip when they see the whip dippin by
The paint on it change like the I-95
I'm just Clyde, without the Bonnie, I got the hollowpoint
Heat for you niggas and the po' for the mamis
Sean Gotti, I'm puttin an end to camraderie
I'm lettin off heat, 'til them eyes get watery
Some gon' ricochet, some gon' hit, y'all gon' get 'em
Fluids gon' disperse out like refreshin club serum
I'm deadly as bite venom but I'm far from a snake
I'll hit you up on your birthday while you cuttin your cake

[Hook: The Game]
We gangsters nigga; you see the cars, the whips
The chains, the fuckin broads we with
We gangsters nigga; we'll come through your hood
A hundred deep and empty the whole clip
We gangsters nigga; we got guns for the beef
And my niggas'll put you under the street
We gangsters nigga; so you better watch what you say
'Fore I empty the whole Glock in your face

[Verse 2: Sean T]
Streets is tough, but ain't no hopscotch lines on the ground
Just burner shells, and police siren sounds
Niggas know who I am in the town; it ain't a circus
But it might as well be, cause you know I'mma clown
I'm a terrain boss, I know most niggas envious dawg
And if a nigga owe me change you better give me it dawg
If you feelin like you wanna leap, make like a frog
You niggas lame, transparent like Wonder Woman's plane
I'm a stunna in this game, a federal figure
Blowin doj' in the hummer, 50 K on my fingers
I'm like a NASCAR winner poppin Mo' and Bill{?}
D-Squad don't give a fuck about nobody else
I pull a {?} to contain your whole, clique for hours
The end result will probably be, pinewood and flowers
So I'll advise you deduct your QP's and powder
We gangsters and we jacking cowards (yup!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sean T]
S.T. nigga D-Squad, G.G.D
Don't get it twisted motherfucker yeah we do creep
We ride out thug, shit we don't die
We lay low like mechanics tryin to fix up rides
A lot of cats say I'm sick in the head, when I anger it's on
Poodles gon' be up missin or dead
I chop haters up, like an old-ass sample
Or creep through your village, like Stallone in "Rambo"
I'm like piranhas on red meat, I'm on you niggas
You afros? Then I guess I got to comb you niggas
So break bread, when you see me dawg hit the flo'
I'm like a nigga off the X, unpredicta-ble
Imitators always hollerin how gangsta they is
But got about as much courage as the Lion in "The Wiz"
Shit I'm into pullin shanks on you fake Jake cats
Me and my burner hold it down man we go way back

[Hook](Verse 1-JT The Bigga Figga)
You talkin big like you feelin the Figg
You at the crib where the safe is in
You got a jig with a half a wig
Can't even stop when I coast on dubbs
Baby boo's tryin to mug, half gone off the scrubs
With a phone full of bugs, I'm doin my thang
And I gotta get my cheddar cuz I'm true in the game
Been iced up, wrist's is froze, switch the clothes
Another Esko, with them chips exposed
I'm a bay cat
Nothin but grindin to get the money on this late night shit
Big timin it ain't funny
Quit, playin games or get out of the range
Cuz I'm tryin to do the thang, and you wanna do the same

(Chorus X2)
(LaJoi) Don't even try to clown
(JT) I know you want a boss like me
(LaJoi) Don't even come around
(JT) Comin through on dubbs
(LaJoi) Cuz I ain't tryin to hear it
(JT) We'll see

(Verse 2-JT The Bigga Figga)
You know you want a real one game and all
When you stopped me in the parking lot at Macy's mall
With a sack full of Rocawear bag at your clothes
And my peanut butter Timbo's be makin me slow
Exchanged numbers for the first time you got your chance
And you been 7 months, without no man
Put my number on the back of your hand I got ghosts
To the spot where we cookin them beats I got dough
Far from bein broke so the time was spent
Every time gettin bent, have a shoppin event
You like gettin laced, with the finest of thangs
'Till you wanna start arguing and playin them games

(Chorus X2)
(LaJoi) Don't even try to clown
(JT) You know you want a boss like me
(LaJoi) Don't even come around
(JT) Comin through on dubbs
(LaJoi) Cuz I ain't tryin to hear it
(JT) We'll see

(Verse 3-JT The Bigga Figga)
You let your acts be your reason for treason you sold out
On my 30 day tour you couldn't--hold out
Gettin--blowed out, with quarters and eighths
In a boat on a lake, with a cat named Jake
Is that the fate of this union goin tic-for-tac
And you told my little brother that you gettin me back
For all the dirt that I done now you cut your losses
Now you pickin and choosin from the rest of the bosses
Never thought you would take it, to this extreme
When you used to be the draft pick, on my team
Keep it clean, surprised when I got in deeper
Now since you actin up I don't need you neither

(Chorus X4)
(LaJoi) Don't even try to clown
(JT) I know you want a boss like me
(LaJoi) Don't even come around
(JT) Comin through on dubbs
(LaJoi) Cuz I ain't tryin to hear it
(JT) We'll see
