[Verse 1: 2-low]
Cover your dome or feel a motherfucking Glock
The rugged child is in the house, I'm letting off shots
Biggity bang biggity bang, hit the motherfucking deck
I'm down on this track and I'm abouts to get wreck
I'm coming like a hustler, never coming buster
Blasting on you hoes screaming, "Die, motherfucker!"
Never showing mercy cause that shit is for the weak
I rhyme with my Glock and knock a nigga off his feet
A young nigga, shorts as I figure
Step up with that bullshit, I'm a greet you with this trigger
Blasting on you hoes and let you know how it feels
Bucking with the 5th ward will get your motherfucking dome peeled
Motherfucker bring it on

[Verse 2: Seagram]
It's the Seagster, the major leagster
Bitch deceiver, nigga life-reliever!
Oakland hustler, never been a busta
Make way for the nine-trey, I'm coming motherfucka
Straight from the 6-9, the final line village
Doing more damage than a Exxon spillage!
Uh, coward, and that's that
I'm known to pack a gat and put heads on flat
No rehabilitatin' my trigga'
Take a nigga out the ghetto
But you can't take the ghetto out the nigga
Ain't nothing changed since the 70s
I'm hellbound nigga, my life ain't never been heavenly
Never slippin punk no, a nigga don't lag
Game tight replace a nigga's Nikes with a toe tag
His zoom, his ass, his zigga I'm the founder
Stacking up bodies like Jeffery Dahmer
Oh, here comes the flow, watch me as I tip toe
To a nigga's window, with my M 6-0
Putting motherfuckers out their misery
And watching the murders reenacted on Unsolved Mysteries
Trick, coward lame pussy ass faggot
Six feet deep is where you sleep with the worms and the maggots
Nigga's can't harm me, Rap-A-Lot army
Coming like Desert Storm, you've been warned
But if you still want some, nigga, bring it on!

[Verse 3: Too Much Trouble]
Too Much Trouble done sewed up the tracks
Bitches not playing like they win or get smacked
By some young niggas that's down to break a bitch
The Nickel Nut and the Band-Aid Bandit

Yes the Nickel Nut pimping ten different sluts
You've encountered slavery bitch I don't give a fuck
That better turn some tricks, a suck a lotta dicks
And come with my money or they get their ass kicked

Geto got hoes on the stroll making my bank roll
But when we tangle bitch, I run with foes
Cause all about the pen, ain't talking about the pussy
I'm talking about the paper, so bitch shake your money maker

It's the pimp pimp pimpin, you're simp simp simpin
Your bitch chose me now you're wimp wimp wimpin
Nigga you was wrong when you reached for your chrome
A slug to your dome, bad news done beat you home
You think we was acting about making but you're wrong
We in a pizzimping and its on so bitches bring it on

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah! (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!

[Verse 4: 5th Ward Boys]
Bring it on motherfucker, here I come with this damn thang
Boom boom boom, and I'm about to make freedom ring
5th Ward Boys coming hard for the nine trey
I'm down with them Geto Boys so make my motherfucking day

The 5th Ward Boys on the motherfucking set
Putting a slug off in your chest
Cause you didn't wear the bulletproof vest
Nigga, ratta tat tat to your temple
Shit is real simple, busting up domes like a pimple

Jump if you want, nigga, and I'm a have to hurt ya
Murder after murder after goddamn murder!
Yo I'm taking niggas to the promised land
With little Bushwick, Scarface, and the goddamn peter man

Lets rock stupid fuck is fucking it up with Double O, life is stuck up
For the ten flow, so what you wanna do, ho
Yeah, cause we're checking mo motherfuckers, parking mo motherfuckers
And killing more motherfuckers than any one of you motherfuckers

While your ho sleeping let's get it on
And get your fucking wig split, fool-ass nigga, now bring it on

[Verse : Odd Squad]
I can't see your ass bitch, so you'd better watch your bust or
Take that from a blind handicapped motherfucker
Smoking weed and steadily downing that Schlitz Malt Liquor
If you wanna step and get done, cause I'm that nigga

Well it's me that nigga D (Who?)
That fat square twister, the one who fucked your sister
I made her pussy blister, got a dick in the side of my pearl white Lac
Keep my weed in the front and my brew in the back
And my heat up under my seat ready to put the lead on ya
So punk motherfuckers try to test me if you wanna

Cause we're smoking that weed, feeling fine
Got me a 40 and a fat-ass dime
Smoking that weed, feeling fine
Got me a 40 and a fat-ass dime!

[Verse 5:Ganksta N-I-P]
A weed-smoking motherfucker, plus I kick doobies
I'm the one that told that nigga to go insane in that Luby's
Ganksta NIP is fucking your daughter, G
I wake up every morning screaming, "Somebody slaughter me!"
Step in my path, your ass is void
Cause I'm an aerodynamic, satanic, schizophrenic android
Your mind ain't deep enough, cars can't creep enough
Dead bodies complaining we too loud, they can't sleep enough
Attempted murder, I didn't mean to hurt her
I hadn't ate in two years, I just wanted a cheeseburger!
A bulletproof vest won't protect your chest
A whole body is hard to digest
Once I flex, count the next
The hardest I won like recreation of Malcolm X
So bring it on, I'm ready to slaughter
Sitting in church, drinking a 40 of holy water

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah! (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!

DMG bring it on

[Verse 6: DMG]
I've been a victim of society
They got me fucked in this whole shit
Niggas running up with M-11's and some mo shit
It seems to me they wanna start something
But I'm a let this motherfucking 9 break em off something
My homie panicked cause he never thought it'd come to that
Miggity Mike serving em soft from these niggas gats
I guess it's like guerilla warfare
Now grab your gat and load your clip and go for deaf until you make it there
And if you don't then grab your nuts, duke
Cause that's the only way these niggas living in the 9-deuce
More murder by killings and slayings, some shit
You fake on your tool and find your homie dead in a ditch
Now the fucking water's getting hot
Homie after homie after homie's getting shot
And niggas are overlookin the joys of life
.357 with them hollow point shells in the midnight
Check it: first I walk up on him like I know him;
Then, I let me conversation start to ho him
Yo, I never debates the way I handle my business
Cause niggas always be fucking shit up well it's time to handle they
Business
He's peeping out my missile as I stand straight
So now it's time to make his ass like a crushed grape
Come check a nigga gun for his get sound get click
Yo, you shoulda brought it on

[Verse 7: Mr. 3-2]
3-2 comin at ya, comin at ya
Don't make me pull my shit and have to cap ya
With my Glock, I make it go "pop," it's a 17 shot
So a nigga gon drop, a nigga gon drop
You heard me roll a fatty
Now I'm at the window of your cocksucking caddy
So what you wanna do? It's about that time
Pop pop pop goes the weasel in my nine
Uh, where your nuts at nigga? You'd better let em hang
Cause we can get it on, ho, it ain't no thang, uh
Mo murder mo motherfucking merrier
Cause I be one of the roughest niggas from the hardcore area
So quit running your mouth, bitch, you know you can't fade this
Rap-A-Lot south shit
It's the 3-motherfucking-2
So bring on your motherfucking crew bitch, we can get it on

[Verse 8: Big Mello]
Strapped assassin, ghetto gladiator
Leaving a path of destruction like the motherfucking Terminator
Lurking the streets of hardcore, stalking like a predator
17 shots to the chest made his clothes wetter than mine
Cause the nine'll hit your ass every time
Got my motherfucking b-mo, going straight for the dome
Wig-splitting nigga with the finger on the trigger
Sinister, symptoms of a motherfucking killer
B-I-G to the motherfucking M-E
Double L-O's not a motherfucking ho
But a cutthroat, smiggity smoking niggas like dope
Now bitch don't choke, cause the dick's down your throat
Getting my blast on, nigga get your ass on
Riggy run your ass home cause I'm a bring it on, homes!

[Verse 9: Scarface]
It's the return of the motherfucking dreadlock
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas headshots
You don't wanna fuck with me, I ain't that motherfucka
I mean that average, run-of-the-mill ass nigga
You hoes better recognize this nigga that you up against;
Mista mista Scarface ain't that nigga to be fucking with
So lay it down niggas, bump it down or feel the pressure
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's known for taking drastic measures
Quick to rip shit and leave a motherfucker twitching
So niggas make a run once my rifle starts spittin'
Round after round after motherfuckin round
So bitches lay it down, I shut em down, I shut em down!
Screaming for vengeance I swear that I meant this descended
Surrender suspended cause, niggas, I meant it
Calm like an Islamic brother from the Nation
Still got the mind of a motherfuckin mental patient!
I got the chrome to my own dome
But I'm a give you one before I take it home, motherfucka, so, uh

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah (Repeat 3x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!A tisket, a tasket, a bloody, bloody basket
Cut his head and ate his leg, now he's in a casket
A tisket, a tasket, N-I-P and dope he did it
He tried to get smart so we ripped out his heart
Cooked it and we split it

Sick in the head, bloodshed in a ant bed
You want a new leg? Give me some needle and thread
So I can sew you one - cause I'm in it to win it
My horoscope said I'mma die in 20 minutes
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm worse than Freddie
You can't kill me cause I'm dead already
Egypt E is the motherfucking shrink(Damn right!)
After 12 o'clock my blood turns hot pink
Nah, you weak-ass hoes can't [???]
A thousand dead cut-up elephants in my luggage
Fuck with a psycho, you end up dead
Those who didn't live, drowned in a turtle's head
A twelve gauge is my only protection
Every bullet shot has a different infection
Woke up this morning with a dead dog on me
So I thought, "Huh - baloney!"
If a nigga run up I don't care if he pushes
Fuck around and find his ass somewhere dead in some sticker bushes
Mess with N-I-P you must be tired of livin
Cut off your head - mmm, Thanksgiving
If you wanna live, your ass better beg
People say I'm crazy cause I go with a cow's leg
Don't run up - cause I kick like Bruce
I wanna and I'm gonna trade heads with a moose
Ganksta N-I-P with the psycho voice
Some say I'm insane cause I married a dead horse
It's Christmas time - Happy New Year G
A dead pig's head makes a good-ass Christmas tree
Kill a nigga for a measly-ass nickel
Frozen blood on a stick, equals strawberry popsicles
Fuck up and watch your Black neck bend
Dead men, making rounds cutting throats with a violin
I ain't gon' lie I feel like killin' my niece
A bird's leg woke up dead with his head in some fish grease
Ten died yesterday, ten just died
Ten died today - now this football's on layaway
You said I was weak, yeah, point blank told me
Tied a needle to my dick then my grandmother rode me
It ain't another nigga in this world can match this
I feel like swimmin' in rat piss
Fuck with N-I-P - I ain't no actor
My twelve daughters died from talking shit to a tractor
I'm getting pissed from the blood I threw up
Barely snapped my fingers and Jupiter blew up!
Hoes, they love me, they say I'm a pleaser
I woke up dead in a cat's leg screaming "Caesar!"
Quick to break your motherfuckin' spine
A dead goat got pregnant and said it was mine
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm down with the Mob
Cuttin' off heads was my last year's Summer job
Blame it on TV - then put it on the map
This is a horror movie rap

A tisket, a tasket, you ain't gon' believe me
It ain't N-I-P's fault that he got crazy thoughts
Blame it on the TV
A tisket, a tasket, you might think I'm sick
If you don't like what I write, you can suck my di-ick
Bitch![Verse 1]
A psycho ass nigga, I'm dissin' your crew
If you don't like the way I rap, tough shit nigga fuck you
It's time for a murder, I'm finna' kick ass
Breast feed newborn babies with unleaded gas
Blood gushin' out your head, it's getting thicker and thicker
Pour some chocolate on your arm so it can taste like a Snicker
Push your ass off a building, check to see if you're dead
Blast back a second blade, plus I'll sharpen your fuckin' head
I'm strapped with the uzi, so get ready to die
Catch a nigga' while he sleep and strike a match in his eye
I'll sneak in your house and kill your ass for fun
Check to see if you're still sleepin', burn a hole in your tongue
Bloody bodies in caskets, the measure are drastic
Dead babies in my house suffocated by plastic
Think you can beat me? You gotta' be jokin' ho...
Threw a brick in Houston, Texas, broke a window in Tokyo
Your sister stole my money, that's alright, I'ma slam her
Catch that bitch by herself, and beat her the fuck up with a hammer
Throw your daughter in the air, hope that bitch break her leg
Be nice and help her up and kick her dead in the head
No bullshittin', you must be smokin that rock ho
Snatch some meat out your stomach so I can make me a taco

[Chorus and Break]
You'll bleed from your head to your toe
That's how it is, when you fuckin wit' a psycho
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]

[Verse 2]
A mothafuckin' psycho...I need to be dead
Took the knife out of my neck and ate the meat out' my own head
Necks and throats, bein' brutally torn'
Arms and legs dipped in blood taste good with some popcorn
I'm mentally psycho, insane with a triple-six
Six hundred dead cat heads screamin' in a crucifix
Yo I'll be damned if I don't get no respect
Drunk a pint of goat's blood, then I died in a squirrel's nest
Yeah
You mothafuckas' said you think that I'm soft
That's why you' bleedin' with a thousand dead rats in yo' fuckin mouth
To kill a nigga' is a chance I can't pass up
After hitting you wit' a stick, naw' don't fall...get yo' ass up!
Some say I'm crazy, some say I'm a crook
Cut up his body so damn bad, the flies said "UUUHHN!?"
I won't stop shootin' til' somebody gets shot
A bunch of bloody cut off fingers, anybody want red hots?
I won't sweat, but then I'm a threat
Here's a bullet for you, and your child that ain't born yet
You mothafuckas' still tryin' to diss
Beat a nigga' in his chest til' his stomach say "Fuck this!"
A violent nigga, stickin punks like paste
Ho, I'll slap yo' ass so hard my hand will go through yo' fuckin' face
Marriage -
Me and yo' mama getting married soon...
After I fuck her I'ma kill her at the honeymoon

[Chorus and Break]
You'll bleed from your head to your toe
That's how it is, when you fuckin wit' a psycho
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]

[Verse 3]
This is a mothafuckin' WARNING
A damn red alert
Squeeze yo' neck with some pliers til' I see blood squirt
I'ma crazy mothafucka', smokin' punks is my joy
You don't really wanna' fuck with me boy
Flashbacks from Panama makes the gangster elite
12 O'Clock I'm out searching for some good looking brains to eat
Growin' and showin', steady
You talkin' shit to me? You must don't know who you fuckin' with
See what I'm saying; Ganksta Nip means "DOOM"
Mercenary plus a ninja, rifleman in a courtroom
Throats on a kite, got intentions to fight
Bodybags in the street, dogs eat good for a week
Bitch I'll shoot you in your face, you think I won't do it?
Charles Manson, Freddy Krueger, makin' babies drink lighter fluid
Yeah I'ma gangster, I ain't got time to be mushy
Keep yo' bitch out my face cause I might blow up her pussy
Graveyard in my bed, only when I get mad
Arms and legs in my closet, heads and throats in my trashbag
Talkin' that shit, you'll get beat with some switches
Blew up a convalescent center cause I hate old bitches
I try to be cool, but y'all won't leave me alone
South Park lunatic, with the mind of Jim Jones
I'm hard to beat, favorite food is raw meat
Two-Hundred blenders in my head, crushin' heads like pigs' feet

[Chorus and Break]
You'll bleed from your head to your toe
That's how it is, when you fuckin wit' a psycho
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]Psych Daddy, can me and my three friends come and play with you
Tonight?
Oh yeah, you and your three friends can come play with me
Tonight, and you and your three friends can come pay with
Tonight, you know what I'm sayin?
Big Syke, you know what I'm talkin about
Erotic, exotic, and a little.....psychotic

[Verse 1]
Picture a room where a con lives, it's dark inside
Newspaper clippins on the wall, from vics that died
Blood everywhere, you can tell the psycho went through
He had darts in their faces up to number fifty two
Psycho Uh, stalkin niggas, butcher knives stays handy
He would sit inside the park, and laugh and give kids candy
They say he was weird, but the bodies he killed
He always scratched off the names of the people he killed
Real slow, Pysch torture style, pass me the scissors
And cut off microscopic pieces like a mirror
Terror screams, let me know the spinal was crumbled
By the gestures they made and the words that they mumbled
Maybe I can slice a throat when I'm ready
It takes practice, training to keep a nail gun steady
You should yell when it clicks, cuz blood finna seep
And bring a hundred thousand mourners and children to weep

[Chorus] X 8
Erotic and exotic
And a little psychotic

[Verse 2]
Graveyards in my slaughter house (.?.)
Mutilation and bacteria to straight cats (?)
You can bet that yours is full of healthy humans and mice
Kinda lookin like a fleshy big pot fulla rice
Twenty people dead, strangled, uh that's my hobby
When I die you think I'm dead, but I really switched bodies
I'm standing there, watchin, they put him in the ground
Blow a sweet when it's over, I'll go kill downtown
Cops don't understand, they thought he was bluffin
They say the officer went crazy when he murdered a dozen
Other cops and didn't (?) cuz life ain't fair
They put his body in the chair, but his mind wasn't there
Soul snatcher, got cha, hit him with a heavy right
Hold him, hug him, hit him with a heavy pipe
Burn him, scorch him, you can bet the people saw it
Leave him there for thirty minutes, you'll see the birds (?)

[Chorus] X 8[Verse 1]
Put in your quarter
Now it's time for a slaughter
I can move the joystick and watch him murder his daughter
Psychopath Liu Kang, he'll leave you for dead
But Mortal Kombat will let you cut off arms and legs and heads
Now you's a killa, even if your enemy's bigger
Fatality means you get to finish the nigga
Playstation, watch for what you're facing
But you can go play Sega
But I'm gonna go get Raiden
But you can go get Sonya Blade, she's a woman
Ice cold nigga Sub Zero, now he's coming
Psycho NIP, uhh game master, I'm lyrically insane
There's some good and some evil in those video games

[Hook:] X 2
Put the quarter in, now you're on your way
Push one player, then you start to play
You must keep it real when you're tryin to win
Game over nigga, you can play it again

[Verse 2]
See I'm the man that took control
And I'm the one you'll be dealin with
Every person that you kill, see you'll really be feelin it
Healin quick, uh it's like you have a new life
Perfectly in great condition, but there's a new knife
Now it's adding, then you gon subtract one
Then you go attack one, then you go collapse one
Now you're shootin fire and ice, bullets servin em all
I'll teach you how to play Psycho NIP and murder em all
You gotta start from the bottom and rise to the top
Fight hard with combinations, finish him with a Glock
Uh, game master, I'm lyrically insane
You got some good and some evil in them video games

[Hook] X 2

[Verse 3]
Now it's a challenge, hopin that your ass ain't afraid
On stage, front page, Johnny Cage had a gauge
Move somethin, act bad, this game had a trigger
(..?..) take no shit and didn't fall none of them niggas
Hold em up, JB, funk psycho ass swing
Enemies all perish from a Scorpion's sting
Cuz I'mma Toys R Us kid, the psych ain't bumpin
Everybody plays the game while they smokin on somethin
Uh, go get your niggas, now you're feelin sorry
Psycho NIP posess the souls of a thousand dead warriors
Uh, game master, I'm lyrically insane
You got some good and some evil in them video games

[Hook] X 3Nip: Yo Triple Six pass the motherfucking amp....
Nigga, everybody else wanna get fucked up too
Triple Six: man, hold up man
	I ain't even hit the motherfucker good yet
Nip: Well go on hit the bitch one more time.....

It starts off in my house somking amp
Feening for blood like a motherfucking vamp
I kept hittin' now my brains on fire
I felt like stuffin' motherfuckers in a dryer
So I take my last puff, then I shot my motherfucking
Next door neighbour for good luck
I jetted to the car, strapped with a fork and a 20 legged chainsaw
Im rollin' down the block, that' s when I saw this pussy ass cop
Pissed in his car like I said in "slaughter"
Bannana clips (gunshots) to his daughter
He pulled his gun, I reached for my axe
And drew "texas" in blood on his motherfucking back
I wasn't through, he said I was soft
Flashbacks from walking town cut his motherfucking legs off
Jumped in the ride then I fired up another square
Slowed down tokin' had me pulling out my fucking hair
Stopped at a store to get a 40
Something in the air said: "it's time to get naughty"
I got pissed, and took me a beer
(tripple gunshots) down with the cashier
She died in my violent capure
(what happend next??) Then tripple six raped her
This nigga started screaming for heaven
He tried to run but he died on isle seven
Now it' s time to break camp
Fucking with that motherfucking amp

Triple Six: ohhh nip, man, I'm fucked up man, here man, take this
Nip: ohhh me too .. I fenna kill a bitch...

Back on the block sounds messing with my head
Even before some amp eyes blood shot fucking red
So I drive to a burger king
Looking real motherfucking mean
Thingking about a hearse
Shot the people in front of me, cause I wanna order first
*may I help you brother??*
- (triple gunshots) help that motherfucker!
Cut out his heart then he felled to his knees
It' s tasty like a whopper with cheese
Saw some people at a table eatin'
It' s halloween, time for trick' a' treatin'
I walked over then the little boy got scared
He kissed his mother then he gave me his fucking head
She got mad and hit me in the chin
So I stabbed her in the neck with a 20-foot stick pen
A little girl kicked me dead in my chest
For 20 days I was kicking her in her fucking breast
I tried to stay calm
Trading urin samples out a motherfucking arm
Her daddy, he thought he was hard
I went insane put her pain out his spinal chord
I had visions of a lamp
Fucking with that motherfucking amp

Nip: Damn Triple six, this is our last amp square!
Triple: for real man?
Nip: hell yeah
Triple: alright, look...

Rolling once again with the amp controlling me
I wander west, the fuck's coming over me
I hit the now it' s time for a _________ ??
Driving on the sidewalk hitting people
I saw this little sweet ol' lady
*nip you gonna kill her??* - yeah, maybe
She started walking across the street
Fenna get her motherfucking ass beat
I blew my horn, she shoulda been listening
Hit her ass so hard, her head rolled to Michigan
Innocent bystanders dead course I dropped one
Like Scarface said: - "I pop one"
I kept hitting, and kept getting mean
Shot every motherfucker I saw under 13
There got the cops, it' s time for death
Loaded up the 12 guage, and I killed myself, fuck...[K-Rino]
Yo, there was a war in South Park
Two o'clock of daytime the sky was dark
No joke, I'm running through blacks smoke and dirt
Saw Point Blank on MLK looking hurt, he said..

[Point Blank]
Dope fiend set me up
Now I'm backtracking myself to see why I done fucked up
Bet, K-Rino, get the gat for me
I don't think I got the nuts, I wants you to dispose of me

[K-Rino]
Blank, you better think before your life crumbles
What you want me to tell Nip? (On a fear, no trouble)
Aight, man, let's get this shit straight
What tool should I use?

[Point Blank]
I prefer the .38 to the dome cause to bad dreams I'm prone
I'm tired of this world, Lord I'm ready to come home
I can't handle it, I'm so afraid I might damage it
So I drop to my knees and use it to my advantage
K, it's funny to think I was making a lot of money
Fell in love with dollar signs and I guess it growed on me
But in reality I fucked up a lot of minds
Destroyed braincells, now I'm losing mine
I'm on the edge and I'm 'bout to jump off
So I'mma sacrifice myself and take it as a loss
It was was hard to choose but I chose the bullet
K, you supposed to be my nigga, now pull it[*gunshot*]

[K-Rino]
So I bailed out and my pace sped
Running full speed while my chest and my face bled
Death busy didn't know exactly
Who I was cause he charged me with his gun pointed at me
Saying:

[DBX]
Boy, what the fuck is wrong with you K, thrusting up on me like that?
But aiyo, take this TV, Eyque's parked in the back
Boy you be flipping on all the shit
We'll have so much shit I'll have an entertainment centre in my bathroom
I heard explosions, screams and shootings
We ran here for ammo, saw keyboard pianos and ended up looting
Perfect timing like Rain Man and my main man
Came up with a game plan to steal that van, you coming or what, man?

[K-Rino]
So we ran to a shack, ten brothers broke us down with a sneak attack
From trying to fight them off, I felt a bone of my fist cracked
They tied us to some dynamite, I thought we would lose out
Till Murder1 came and blew the fuse out

[Murder1]
Murder One fear no danger
My main lady, the 380 taking out motherfuckers
Hanging in South Park car watch me and Guess
Some young punk pulled a gun to Guess' chest
(Then what happened?) I remember I was packing
I felt like Clint Eastwood but smiling while I'm capping
Yo, you know how the story goes
Mining, women, cars, booming system, ______ and foes
See, like trouble follow me
Another funeral, another brother made history
A cop came and accidental
A gunshot, I looked up, it was A.C. Chill

[A.C. Chill]
Gunfire, gun smoke, motherfucker's neck broke
But I be fucking face he choke
In South Park it gets dark, I find a sharp dart
So I stuck it in a fool's heart
Cause they tried to blow my hood up
But as fast as they step up I gotta light their ass up
And that was why and still why
I had to let motherfuckers live, now I gotta let them die
Because it's my responsibility
To shoot a motherfucker in the face if he fuck with me
A.C.'s the name you should remember
Cause I can make it hot as fuck, middle of December

[K-Rino]
So we jumped on the back of A.C. Chill's truck
Riding full speed and both of the wheels stuck
Time to pack up, load the Mac up
Went to Hiram Clarke and scooped Greek for some back-up

[Greek]
The only one drafted from hard hitting Hiram Clarke
Strapped, under my arm is a rabies infested shark
Jumped in the truck, now we headed back to South Park
It's up to me to keep this shit from spreading to Hiram Clarke
Made out a plan to stop every man in cold blood
Cop in a ____ stand drowning in the rhyme blood
Riding down Reed Road, that's when we seen them coming, shit
Nothing but lip syncers, we slaughtered their ass quick
Synchronized my watch to see how fast I can be, quick
To go against the Greek you got the mind of a flea tick
Try by the mic and die by the mic says it all
My last words with eighty gats pointed at me, "Fuck y'all!" [Gunshot]

[K-Rino]
K.O. was knocking out suckers
Nip was jumping off buildings clothes-hanging motherfuckers
I told them both to run fast
The terrorists showed up with both their faces in one mask
Grimm and Egypt-E showed up
They rode up in their ride, hit the breaks and it blowed up
Some suckers tried to get some
Here come The Beholder, I told him to bring the bomb

[The Beholder]
K-Rino, you know I got 'em
So I beat 'em down and drop them cause I don't give a fuck about 'em
As I stalk the streets of South Park
I'm ripping rappers apart cause dead men don't talk
You up against a bad guy who's up to no good
And this man wears a hood
So when I step up, step back
Cause I'm fully prepared to go all out cause I'm all that

[K-Rino]
I ran over to a phone to call C-Rock
Stepped in the booth, tried to break but the door was locked
Yo, and the place filled with gas, Ganksta Nip broke the glass
And pulled me out before it choked my ass

[Ganksta Nip]
What's up, K? What's up with you?
The seven serial psychopath South Park psycho to the rescue
You aight? Wake it up
And just for that I fiend to start fucking the country up
Piece by piece, a limb by limb
The night is dim, to live chances are very slim
Ganksta Nip, the Lord of Darkness
Now I lay me down to sleep in my holy South Parkness[Verse 1: 2-low]
Cover your dome or feel a motherfucking Glock
The rugged child is in the house, I'm letting off shots
Biggity bang biggity bang, hit the motherfucking deck
I'm down on this track and I'm abouts to get wreck
I'm coming like a hustler, never coming buster
Blasting on you hoes screaming, "Die, motherfucker!"
Never showing mercy cause that shit is for the weak
I rhyme with my Glock and knock a nigga off his feet
A young nigga, shorts as I figure
Step up with that bullshit, I'm a greet you with this trigger
Blasting on you hoes and let you know how it feels
Bucking with the 5th ward will get your motherfucking dome peeled
Motherfucker bring it on

[Verse 2: Seagram]
It's the Seagster, the major leagster
Bitch deceiver, nigga life-reliever!
Oakland hustler, never been a busta
Make way for the nine-trey, I'm coming motherfucka
Straight from the 6-9, the final line village
Doing more damage than a Exxon spillage!
Uh, coward, and that's that
I'm known to pack a gat and put heads on flat
No rehabilitatin' my trigga'
Take a nigga out the ghetto
But you can't take the ghetto out the nigga
Ain't nothing changed since the 70s
I'm hellbound nigga, my life ain't never been heavenly
Never slippin punk no, a nigga don't lag
Game tight replace a nigga's Nikes with a toe tag
His zoom, his ass, his zigga I'm the founder
Stacking up bodies like Jeffery Dahmer
Oh, here comes the flow, watch me as I tip toe
To a nigga's window, with my M 6-0
Putting motherfuckers out their misery
And watching the murders reenacted on Unsolved Mysteries
Trick, coward lame pussy ass faggot
Six feet deep is where you sleep with the worms and the maggots
Nigga's can't harm me, Rap-A-Lot army
Coming like Desert Storm, you've been warned
But if you still want some, nigga, bring it on!

[Verse 3: Too Much Trouble]
Too Much Trouble done sewed up the tracks
Bitches not playing like they win or get smacked
By some young niggas that's down to break a bitch
The Nickel Nut and the Band-Aid Bandit

Yes the Nickel Nut pimping ten different sluts
You've encountered slavery bitch I don't give a fuck
That better turn some tricks, a suck a lotta dicks
And come with my money or they get their ass kicked

Geto got hoes on the stroll making my bank roll
But when we tangle bitch, I run with foes
Cause all about the pen, ain't talking about the pussy
I'm talking about the paper, so bitch shake your money maker

It's the pimp pimp pimpin, you're simp simp simpin
Your bitch chose me now you're wimp wimp wimpin
Nigga you was wrong when you reached for your chrome
A slug to your dome, bad news done beat you home
You think we was acting about making but you're wrong
We in a pizzimping and its on so bitches bring it on

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah! (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!

[Verse 4: 5th Ward Boys]
Bring it on motherfucker, here I come with this damn thang
Boom boom boom, and I'm about to make freedom ring
5th Ward Boys coming hard for the nine trey
I'm down with them Geto Boys so make my motherfucking day

The 5th Ward Boys on the motherfucking set
Putting a slug off in your chest
Cause you didn't wear the bulletproof vest
Nigga, ratta tat tat to your temple
Shit is real simple, busting up domes like a pimple

Jump if you want, nigga, and I'm a have to hurt ya
Murder after murder after goddamn murder!
Yo I'm taking niggas to the promised land
With little Bushwick, Scarface, and the goddamn peter man

Lets rock stupid fuck is fucking it up with Double O, life is stuck up
For the ten flow, so what you wanna do, ho
Yeah, cause we're checking mo motherfuckers, parking mo motherfuckers
And killing more motherfuckers than any one of you motherfuckers

While your ho sleeping let's get it on
And get your fucking wig split, fool-ass nigga, now bring it on

[Verse : Odd Squad]
I can't see your ass bitch, so you'd better watch your bust or
Take that from a blind handicapped motherfucker
Smoking weed and steadily downing that Schlitz Malt Liquor
If you wanna step and get done, cause I'm that nigga

Well it's me that nigga D (Who?)
That fat square twister, the one who fucked your sister
I made her pussy blister, got a dick in the side of my pearl white Lac
Keep my weed in the front and my brew in the back
And my heat up under my seat ready to put the lead on ya
So punk motherfuckers try to test me if you wanna

Cause we're smoking that weed, feeling fine
Got me a 40 and a fat-ass dime
Smoking that weed, feeling fine
Got me a 40 and a fat-ass dime!

[Verse 5:Ganksta N-I-P]
A weed-smoking motherfucker, plus I kick doobies
I'm the one that told that nigga to go insane in that Luby's
Ganksta NIP is fucking your daughter, G
I wake up every morning screaming, "Somebody slaughter me!"
Step in my path, your ass is void
Cause I'm an aerodynamic, satanic, schizophrenic android
Your mind ain't deep enough, cars can't creep enough
Dead bodies complaining we too loud, they can't sleep enough
Attempted murder, I didn't mean to hurt her
I hadn't ate in two years, I just wanted a cheeseburger!
A bulletproof vest won't protect your chest
A whole body is hard to digest
Once I flex, count the next
The hardest I won like recreation of Malcolm X
So bring it on, I'm ready to slaughter
Sitting in church, drinking a 40 of holy water

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah! (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!

DMG bring it on

[Verse 6: DMG]
I've been a victim of society
They got me fucked in this whole shit
Niggas running up with M-11's and some mo shit
It seems to me they wanna start something
But I'm a let this motherfucking 9 break em off something
My homie panicked cause he never thought it'd come to that
Miggity Mike serving em soft from these niggas gats
I guess it's like guerilla warfare
Now grab your gat and load your clip and go for deaf until you make it there
And if you don't then grab your nuts, duke
Cause that's the only way these niggas living in the 9-deuce
More murder by killings and slayings, some shit
You fake on your tool and find your homie dead in a ditch
Now the fucking water's getting hot
Homie after homie after homie's getting shot
And niggas are overlookin the joys of life
.357 with them hollow point shells in the midnight
Check it: first I walk up on him like I know him;
Then, I let me conversation start to ho him
Yo, I never debates the way I handle my business
Cause niggas always be fucking shit up well it's time to handle they
Business
He's peeping out my missile as I stand straight
So now it's time to make his ass like a crushed grape
Come check a nigga gun for his get sound get click
Yo, you shoulda brought it on

[Verse 7: Mr. 3-2]
3-2 comin at ya, comin at ya
Don't make me pull my shit and have to cap ya
With my Glock, I make it go "pop," it's a 17 shot
So a nigga gon drop, a nigga gon drop
You heard me roll a fatty
Now I'm at the window of your cocksucking caddy
So what you wanna do? It's about that time
Pop pop pop goes the weasel in my nine
Uh, where your nuts at nigga? You'd better let em hang
Cause we can get it on, ho, it ain't no thang, uh
Mo murder mo motherfucking merrier
Cause I be one of the roughest niggas from the hardcore area
So quit running your mouth, bitch, you know you can't fade this
Rap-A-Lot south shit
It's the 3-motherfucking-2
So bring on your motherfucking crew bitch, we can get it on

[Verse 8: Big Mello]
Strapped assassin, ghetto gladiator
Leaving a path of destruction like the motherfucking Terminator
Lurking the streets of hardcore, stalking like a predator
17 shots to the chest made his clothes wetter than mine
Cause the nine'll hit your ass every time
Got my motherfucking b-mo, going straight for the dome
Wig-splitting nigga with the finger on the trigger
Sinister, symptoms of a motherfucking killer
B-I-G to the motherfucking M-E
Double L-O's not a motherfucking ho
But a cutthroat, smiggity smoking niggas like dope
Now bitch don't choke, cause the dick's down your throat
Getting my blast on, nigga get your ass on
Riggy run your ass home cause I'm a bring it on, homes!

[Verse 9: Scarface]
It's the return of the motherfucking dreadlock
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas headshots
You don't wanna fuck with me, I ain't that motherfucka
I mean that average, run-of-the-mill ass nigga
You hoes better recognize this nigga that you up against;
Mista mista Scarface ain't that nigga to be fucking with
So lay it down niggas, bump it down or feel the pressure
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's known for taking drastic measures
Quick to rip shit and leave a motherfucker twitching
So niggas make a run once my rifle starts spittin'
Round after round after motherfuckin round
So bitches lay it down, I shut em down, I shut em down!
Screaming for vengeance I swear that I meant this descended
Surrender suspended cause, niggas, I meant it
Calm like an Islamic brother from the Nation
Still got the mind of a motherfuckin mental patient!
I got the chrome to my own dome
But I'm a give you one before I take it home, motherfucka, so, uh

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah (Repeat 3x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon![Hook x4]
"Dem laws is tryna lock us up for the whole century"

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
How come y'all like to bother people on the black folk side of town
We can't even throw a block party without y'all tricks coming around
Everyday all they wanna do is hit you hard
What you looking for? I don't sip no bar
Ripping up seats in my brand new car
Damn, man, y'all taking this shit too far
Preposterous, just cause of who I am I get harassed
I just ask ya for ya badge number and damn you wanna blast
Tryna shatter me and break me like a hammer to some glass
Then slam you on the grass, even with that camera on the dash
Mr. Gram of potent hash, my homegirl Pamela had stashed
Flunked an exam from ghetto class a first day amateur could pass
He was mad because we had bang and was jamming it on blast
I should have ran cause I don't think his fat ass stamina could last
They might follow from your door to Mexico
Hope your gun accidentally go off and shoots you through your own ass like Plaxico
In 59 pieces of your vest will blow
These police giving took-out everyday, keep harassing, you'll be the next to go

[Hook x4]
"Dem laws is tryna lock us up for the whole century"

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
These pigs used to wanna peel you. "What you mean used to? They still do"
Make no mistake cause you living the ghetto these police is out to kill you
The whole department's racist, pull you over in the darkest places
When they walk upon you pull your piece and let it spark in their faces
Go to the courthouse, everyday the same replay
Satan in the form of the cops, the judge and the DA
The truth is most black people are lacking info
They never knew about the Willie Lynch Letter or Jim Crow
They want you dead or locked up so they keep coming hard
Bloodshed, they never bored, they'll shoot you in your mama's yard
We having a party, we done sewed up the whole block
What's the occasion? A racist cop just got his ass popped
Yay! Some of y'all might think this just a song
But this gon' keep on happening till y'all learn to leave us alone
The next stunt will make the whole hood go crazy
What kind of coward will use a taser on an old lady?

[Hook x4]
"Dem laws is tryna lock us up for the whole century"

[Verse 3: Point Blank]
Fuck Dem Laws (Fuck 'em) Tryna lock a nigga for a whole century
Put a nigga in jail and don't give a damn about what he plead
They'll take your cash, strip your ass, finger print and take your belt
Make you bent over and cough, goddamn I ain't got nothing else
First of all I'm in this bitch and I really don't even suppose to be
I was at the club chilling and two motherfuckers lied on me
Now I'm fighting the case, pin a lawyer and I still got bills on my back
I got caught up in some bullshit, real talk, nigga I do this
I suppose I should write my judge a long letter
And tell her I ain't coming back and she owe me 50 stacks
And my daddy always told me, "Never-never get scared, nigga
Look 'em in their eyes, stand strong, you a man, nigga"
So fuck it, two tears in the bucket
All of the DA's, prosecutors and judge can suck it
Can't water cask for fucking killer
Ready to murk, every five-o nigga, for reala

[Hook x4]
"Dem laws is tryna lock us up for the whole century"[K-Rino]
Yo, this goes out to all these perpetrating MCs in South Park who don't know who the real South Park pioneers are
This is for you, suckers
Run up!

[Verse 1: Ganksta NIP]
This dimension is psychotic, no chance to escape
I psychopathically summon visions of vehicles being raped
Quick to daze ya. If that don't faze ya
I'mma travel back through time; then I'mma spiritually re-raise ya
Mirror reflecting horrible sculptures
Of planets disappearing and reappearing in other cultures
Demonic air pollutes [?]
Projecting visions of dead bodies with living split wigs
Evil cuts when six, with the sight sound
Every man is a twix
Women and children get [?]
So much destruction I changed my views
Rewind time: Now reality is new news
Acid, hurricane, rain, heavy screams from pressure, pain
Pistol is punishment prosecuting your first name
Ganksta NIP is a curse
Psychotic demon, I'm imprisoned in this universe

[Hook: K-Rino]
One dimension of a Universe
Leader of the SPC, I am the first
A lyrical curse will make your weak rhyme burst
Better hope that you die cause if you live it gets worse (kick)

[Verse 2: A.C. Chill]
I'm a brainiac about to attack
You thought cause I'm dark-skinned
That I can't win—Fuck that!
You best listen if you call yourself dissin'
Mess around and turn your back and find your whole fucking head missin'
A nigga was tripping out. It ain't hard to pick him out
He's the only fool with his insides sticking out
When I provoke, your back bone will be broke
You started all of this shit to get your goddamn ass smoked
Bended the rules, got kicked out of school
My psychiatrist diagnosed me as a damn fool
Rose from the bottom. Rough lyrics, I got em
After a battle, my opponent shook my hand, so I shot him
A.C. Chill on the loose
Lyrics kicking like Bruce
I put this razor on your ass and drink your blood like juice
I'm such an abyss, when I ball up my fist
I knock off half of your motherfucking head, and I still missed

[Hook: K-Rino]
Two dimensions of a Universe
Leader of the SPC, I am the first
A lyrical curse will make your weak rhyme burst
Better hope that you die cause if you live it gets worse

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
In my verse nobody stops or drops me
Picture yourself the victim of a telepathic autopsy
Life is a jail I've been trapped by the powers
But mentally I served twenty years in three hours
First I lyrically fought ya then lyrically brought ya to death
Electrocution Chinese Water Torture truth
Nobody's deeper than K-Rino it's true
To think about me for a minute takes a month and a half to do
Brain psychology, verbal technology
Cracked a rapper so bad I made his shadow wanna follow me
So go buy a pen. You'll lose if you try and win
I'll die, resurrect, die and resurrect and die again
Verbal destruction brother watch that building burst
He tried to steal second base and got killed at first
My record's 99 and 1 in a rhyme
Nah trick, I didn't lose. I beat myself one time
Because I'm

[Hook: K-Rino]
Three dimensions of a Universe
Leader of the SPC, I am the first
A lyrical curse will make your weak rhyme burst
Better hope that you die cause if you live it gets worse (kick)

[Verse 4: Dope-E]
What is a terrorist? Here is the definition
So listen as I explore in my one dimension
A lyrical commentator, pro-black manipulator
Government hater, into violence, Al Qaeda
Yeah, I'm fifty deep as if I was sleep
But as soon as I try to doze off, I get a beep
Time for the motherfucking grand finale
Ain't neah motherfucker finna ban my rally
Lyrical gift kicks knowledge uplifts so quick, shifts
From style to topic subject, I drop that shit
Highly intelligent, enormous vocabulary
Never [?] although sanity varies
Barely dare me, I don't care, G, I share, see
I got six bullets for you, three for the bitch I'm marrying
I bomb your ass with a nuclear
I got a black double-breasted three-piece suit for ya
[?] the gat, put it in his back, and make him back up
Dimensions of terror just struck

[Hook: K-Rino]
Four dimensions of a Universe
Leader of the SPC, I am the first
A lyrical curse will make your weak rhyme burst
Better hope that you die cause if you live it gets worse

[K-Rino]
Yo check this out man
Yo A.C
All these young motherfuckers out here, nine, ten years old
When I started this shit, the Coalition running shit, but yet they wanna front
Run up!(If you don't like the way I rap
Talk shit)

(If you don't like the way I rap
Talk shit
Nigga)

(If you don't like the way I rap
Talk shit
Nigga, fuck you)

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
Boom, this topic is catastrophic, targets are gunable
K-Rino's torture mile is unrunable
Time for death, nothing material is worth this wealth
The Earth itself with soon rebirth itself
Can it be? K is a seed, nature's planted me
Fantasy, its power is the brain Allah granted me
Masterpiece, Original Point-Blank gets mastered
O.P.B. stands for 'overrated punk-ass bastards'
So they run, they know them have to run
They never stand a chance against the dangerous one
I'll beat them down to dirt, either with bullets or my hand
Cause either way I chose, them hoes could never withstand
So I just pull out the Black Book and you'll see the fall of em
A million ways to die, they'll get all of em
OK-Rino you know you'll win it
They talked that shit for a year, but the fight only lasted a minute
Hoes, door number one has a gun
Door number two has your crew getting hung
Door number three has the S.P.C. clique
In a room making your sister suck everybody's dick
So fuck you!

[Verse 2: Dope-E]
That's it, I'm sick of these devil tricks
You call me a nigger, you get your motherfucking skull slit
Devils running away, but they get caught, we won't let it pass
I'll catch ya, if it takes me goin to the grave and stabbin yo ass
First, I'll take your wrist and cut it
Your blood, blood, blood, I love it, love it, love it
Tricknowlodgy steady tryna war with me, slaughter me
Drainin with my hands, I'll skeed blood from your artery
The game gets hot, I set your ass afire
When you step to the 10year vet musical scientist never will I retire
Gaining respect one way or another
Sayin lyrics, layin tracks I'm comin up and bringing brothers
Music is what I do, music is what I love
All praise is due to Allah above
A message to you suckers, ain't doin nothin for the cause
And when revolution comes, your ass gets scared and you pause
I handle my business, S.P.C. ain't no sloppy click
The law searched my car and found a kilo of floppy disks
Cause sellin dope is a risk, so I rap pro-black
And I act how I wanna motherfucking act
Fuck you, bitch

[Verse 3: Point Blank]
A lotta niggas wanna know my identity
Well, my identity is Point-Blank, bitch, so don't fuck with me
I hope you didn't get confused
When those punk-ass other niggas tried to step in my shoes
Who knocked them hoes out the box last year?
In '91 I 'sposed to die, well, how the fuck I'm still standin here?
I don't know what you heard, but I never left
And never got my clique, cause I took care of my damn self
I wish them hoes tried to rush me
And I'mma kill the youngest member in they muthafuckin family
I get respect everywhere I go
I even took a picture killin myself, but they don't hear me though
I'm in a world of my own
Still stick my head under guillotines, and bad dreams on prone
So you better hold your ground up
Cause when I frown up, bitch, I will fuck your town up
You N.W.A/Ice Cube-wanna-be's
Fuck that reel to reel talk, and come get you some of these
Oh, don't tell me, are you scared of the S.P.C.?
Or is it the fact that they kill and die for me?
Fuck you, bitch, with your broke-ass record label

[Verse 4: Ganksta NIP]
Yo, chill Point-Blank, he didn't mean what he said
Dope-E, don't chop his leg, Deuce-Twice, don't chop his head
Lil' Fry, don't cut his throats, Lye, don't feed him to the goats
I just heard some thunder, use his skin for a raincoat
DBX, don't cut his heart, EyeQ stop makin faces
You'll get your turn, use his flesh for the horse races
AC-Chill, stop burnin down his house
K-Rino, stop burnin down his spouse
Tec-9, don't stab his girl, Brain-Dead, don't slice her ear
Triple X, stop visualizin cups for blood-thirsty Ill Bill
X Man E, don't follow his sister
She's only 4, don't you think that her parents will miss her?
Jay, don't bust his lip, throw him through the doors
Take down the dynamite attached to his open pores
Niggas, watch yourself when the S.P.C. creepin
Klondike Kat, scratch his eyeballs out while he's sleepin
Lizac, don't squeeze his face with the pliers
PSK, you and 38, won't y'all stop makin hair fires
Ganksta NIP is hard as a tank
Click-click-boom-boom at bitch-ass Original Point-Blank
Bitch

[Outro: Gangsta NIP]
Yo, you know I know who the real one
Bitch-ass, trick-ass nigga, it's your boy NIP
Straight up, nigga
Whenever your bitch-ass crew, nigga
Whoever, whenever, wherever's clever
Bitch
Fuck you

Bitch-ass Point-Blank
That fake-ass Point-Blank
When we see you, your ship's gonna sink

In any weather

BitchA tisket, a tasket, a bloody, bloody basket
Cut his head and ate his leg, now he's in a casket
A tisket, a tasket, N-I-P and dope he did it
He tried to get smart so we ripped out his heart
Cooked it and we split it

Sick in the head, bloodshed in a ant bed
You want a new leg? Give me some needle and thread
So I can sew you one - cause I'm in it to win it
My horoscope said I'mma die in 20 minutes
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm worse than Freddie
You can't kill me cause I'm dead already
Egypt E is the motherfucking shrink(Damn right!)
After 12 o'clock my blood turns hot pink
Nah, you weak-ass hoes can't [???]
A thousand dead cut-up elephants in my luggage
Fuck with a psycho, you end up dead
Those who didn't live, drowned in a turtle's head
A twelve gauge is my only protection
Every bullet shot has a different infection
Woke up this morning with a dead dog on me
So I thought, "Huh - baloney!"
If a nigga run up I don't care if he pushes
Fuck around and find his ass somewhere dead in some sticker bushes
Mess with N-I-P you must be tired of livin
Cut off your head - mmm, Thanksgiving
If you wanna live, your ass better beg
People say I'm crazy cause I go with a cow's leg
Don't run up - cause I kick like Bruce
I wanna and I'm gonna trade heads with a moose
Ganksta N-I-P with the psycho voice
Some say I'm insane cause I married a dead horse
It's Christmas time - Happy New Year G
A dead pig's head makes a good-ass Christmas tree
Kill a nigga for a measly-ass nickel
Frozen blood on a stick, equals strawberry popsicles
Fuck up and watch your Black neck bend
Dead men, making rounds cutting throats with a violin
I ain't gon' lie I feel like killin' my niece
A bird's leg woke up dead with his head in some fish grease
Ten died yesterday, ten just died
Ten died today - now this football's on layaway
You said I was weak, yeah, point blank told me
Tied a needle to my dick then my grandmother rode me
It ain't another nigga in this world can match this
I feel like swimmin' in rat piss
Fuck with N-I-P - I ain't no actor
My twelve daughters died from talking shit to a tractor
I'm getting pissed from the blood I threw up
Barely snapped my fingers and Jupiter blew up!
Hoes, they love me, they say I'm a pleaser
I woke up dead in a cat's leg screaming "Caesar!"
Quick to break your motherfuckin' spine
A dead goat got pregnant and said it was mine
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm down with the Mob
Cuttin' off heads was my last year's Summer job
Blame it on TV - then put it on the map
This is a horror movie rap

A tisket, a tasket, you ain't gon' believe me
It ain't N-I-P's fault that he got crazy thoughts
Blame it on the TV
A tisket, a tasket, you might think I'm sick
If you don't like what I write, you can suck my di-ick
Bitch!Crooked cops
Crooked cops
See how they drop
See how they drop
They pull me over to check my ride
I pull out my nine, and three of em died
I promised to never let one slide
The crooked cops
Bitches

Kill a crooked cop
Mi say mi killin a crooked cop
Mi killin a crooked cop
Now watch em drop
Now watch em drop (2x)

Yeah
'93, peace to the streets
The cops will soon be deceased

I'm havin thoughts of Rodney King, so I gotta click on a crooked cop
Decisions have been made, they ass gotta drop
Get your Glock, no warnin shot, if you punks try to block
Hollow points to they hand's joint, they turn into flesh lop
Yeah, them muthafuckas think a psycho is jokin
Crooked cops on the loose, fuck a truce, bust they head open
Check it, in '93 they gotta raise out the hood
Or feel a million .380s blazin like firewood
Once upon a time on the M.L.K.-strip
Five-o started harassin, brought that shit upon Ganksta NIP
That nigga was full of weed. and ready to blast
H.K., 50 rounds, two cops down from the near crash
Rolled up, they tried to make a psycho fold up
But hold up ( *shots* ) the Tec had shit sowed up
Yo, jetted fast after the blast with the mask
66 of em died, trick didn't even have to ask

Now buck em down
Mi say mi killin a crooked cop
Mi killin a crooked cop
Now watch em drop
Now watch em drop

Mi want to kill a crooked cop, cause they beat me down
Real niggas gather up and run they ass out of town
They have no muthafuckin business rollin in our hood
The next time you see a cop, fuck the punk peckerwood
Pop-pop with the Glock, the Tec-9 sounds
Keep on fillin up the clip until they fall to the ground
And when he fall to the ground, take two steps back
Then take your knife, chop his head with a axe

Fuck em, they ain't shit, they got nines, we got nines
They have a few good men, we have black, strong hood-long lines
Of gangsta-ass murderers, ex-cons
Three-time-losers, pull out your fire arms
Field niggas hyped up, and ready to win
Clear the streets with the Uzis, break our o.g.'s out the pen
Round em up, now we think on the same level
Let's put our minds together, now let's click on the fuckin devil

Now buck em down
Mi say mi killin a crooked cop
Mi killin a crooked cop
Now watch em drop
Now watch em drop
Now watch em drop
Now watch em drop
Mi killin a crooked cop
Now watch em drop
Now watch em drop

S.P.C

We got to make these cops raise they ass out of South Park
It's getting worser every day by day, so they kill us after dark
But if we get our minds together we can overcome
So every nigga old enough, go out and buy a gun
Muthafucka

Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot to kill
All those crooked cops
Load up your x-can and spray, spray, spray
And we'll make they bitch-ass drop
Muthafucka
They aren't really know if we click that they ass cannot win
( *shots*) ...with the Tec, and you'll never have to worry about em again

Mi killin a crooked cop
Mi say mi killin a crooked cop
Mi say mi killin a crooked cop
Now watch em drop
Now watch em drop (2x)

Now watch them hoes drop

S.P.CAsaalm-alaikum, brother [Name] X
(Well, laikum-asalaam, blackman)
Brother, I've been having -
Psychic thoughts, revelational visions lately
I want you to tell me what you think about em
(Well, go head, brother, you are the original man)

[Hook]
Psychic thoughts are what I conceive
Are they true or am I full of bad weed?
You place the judgment, you make the decision
But even so, death is my ambition

[VERSE 1]
I'm the South Park psycho, I'm hoppin, muthafucka, I'm pissed
So I unleash the dragon, fire burns through the broke wrist
Yo, psychic psychology, devil's gonna die
Hold up, a vision is comin, unknown creatures fly from the sky
Fuck this fired-up, I feel I'm linked with this weed
I keeps sayin 'terror', so terror it is indeed
Focus your view points, or you'll be dead
Devil's babies die early, curly, sharp axe to the head
Comments from a murderer, my thoughts are sinister
Cursed by a priest, pastor, illusionist minister
A spiritual magician, master of tricks
With wizardry, witch, more graphic thoughts of a crucifix
Yo, plus a sniper, sudden death, cranium claws
Flyin' is dangerous, airplane sabotage
I mirror the messenger, I'm sent from beyond
As time sets back, the hourglass wouldn't respond
Flashes of heatstrokes, this is an order
It's comin to a time where court judges is camcorders
Yo, Ganksta NIP, a mental warrior brought
Comin soon: genocide, but first beware of the psychic thoughts

[Hook]

[VERSE 2]
Real soon, bitch, you're gonna see tragedy
Violent winds at 300 miles per hour, sacred savagery
Lives are uncounted for, let's even the score
Psychic thoughts of different mammals comin up from the ocean's floor
Powerful gun sounds all across the globe
Tires are now extinct, niggas drivin jets [???]
Death to the maximum, it seems like a dream
Infrared practice butcher knife, stump on a laser beam
Mental hypnosis, I meditate, that's how
I see the ozone layer's bout to drop any minute now
You know I'm a psycho, I come from the premonition
Of thoughts of genocide from the beast-like competition
Yo, them muthafuckas make them South Park niggas clown
It's going on three years, the law has been shut down
To all devils, I'm talking to you
The war in South Park has finally come true
(NIP, what you was doin' when all that was jumpin up?)
Crooked cops, I was personally pumpin em up
Ganksta NIP can never be caught
3rd eye insight, knowledge visions of psychic thoughts

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Revolution is hyped up, niggas causin casualties
_Faces Of Death_ ain't no movin no more, now it's reality
Human destruction, SPC done broke records
Bodies fallin off of buildings every 19 muthafuckin seconds
Serious sex thoughts, pussy is blades
Over half the population on earth, they done caught AIDS
A major catastrophy, terrible weather
Winter, spring, summer, fall, all combined together
Dimensions of darkness, but is there a light switch?
Children can't handle it, some are havin night fits
Niggas whippin ass, in Allah we trust
But to strictly be real, them devils killin a lot of us
Hold up, wait, we killin em suckers
We can get em, nigga (*blast*) we done took over this muthafucka
And after that, no more signs of the beast
In the year 2000, you're gonna experience peace
Among brothers, no more devils to show up
By the year 3000, the world's gonna blow up
Yo, Ganksta NIP could never be caught
To enforce I dive into psychic thoughts

(America, Farrakhan is warning you today
Goddamnit, you're either gonna change or die
Young black men no longer lift every voice and sing
But you lift every damn fist and swing)[Verse 1]
A psycho ass nigga, I'm dissin' your crew
If you don't like the way I rap, tough shit nigga fuck you
It's time for a murder, I'm finna' kick ass
Breast feed newborn babies with unleaded gas
Blood gushin' out your head, it's getting thicker and thicker
Pour some chocolate on your arm so it can taste like a Snicker
Push your ass off a building, check to see if you're dead
Blast back a second blade, plus I'll sharpen your fuckin' head
I'm strapped with the uzi, so get ready to die
Catch a nigga' while he sleep and strike a match in his eye
I'll sneak in your house and kill your ass for fun
Check to see if you're still sleepin', burn a hole in your tongue
Bloody bodies in caskets, the measure are drastic
Dead babies in my house suffocated by plastic
Think you can beat me? You gotta' be jokin' ho...
Threw a brick in Houston, Texas, broke a window in Tokyo
Your sister stole my money, that's alright, I'ma slam her
Catch that bitch by herself, and beat her the fuck up with a hammer
Throw your daughter in the air, hope that bitch break her leg
Be nice and help her up and kick her dead in the head
No bullshittin', you must be smokin that rock ho
Snatch some meat out your stomach so I can make me a taco

[Chorus and Break]
You'll bleed from your head to your toe
That's how it is, when you fuckin wit' a psycho
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]

[Verse 2]
A mothafuckin' psycho...I need to be dead
Took the knife out of my neck and ate the meat out' my own head
Necks and throats, bein' brutally torn'
Arms and legs dipped in blood taste good with some popcorn
I'm mentally psycho, insane with a triple-six
Six hundred dead cat heads screamin' in a crucifix
Yo I'll be damned if I don't get no respect
Drunk a pint of goat's blood, then I died in a squirrel's nest
Yeah
You mothafuckas' said you think that I'm soft
That's why you' bleedin' with a thousand dead rats in yo' fuckin mouth
To kill a nigga' is a chance I can't pass up
After hitting you wit' a stick, naw' don't fall...get yo' ass up!
Some say I'm crazy, some say I'm a crook
Cut up his body so damn bad, the flies said "UUUHHN!?"
I won't stop shootin' til' somebody gets shot
A bunch of bloody cut off fingers, anybody want red hots?
I won't sweat, but then I'm a threat
Here's a bullet for you, and your child that ain't born yet
You mothafuckas' still tryin' to diss
Beat a nigga' in his chest til' his stomach say "Fuck this!"
A violent nigga, stickin punks like paste
Ho, I'll slap yo' ass so hard my hand will go through yo' fuckin' face
Marriage -
Me and yo' mama getting married soon...
After I fuck her I'ma kill her at the honeymoon

[Chorus and Break]
You'll bleed from your head to your toe
That's how it is, when you fuckin wit' a psycho
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]

[Verse 3]
This is a mothafuckin' WARNING
A damn red alert
Squeeze yo' neck with some pliers til' I see blood squirt
I'ma crazy mothafucka', smokin' punks is my joy
You don't really wanna' fuck with me boy
Flashbacks from Panama makes the gangster elite
12 O'Clock I'm out searching for some good looking brains to eat
Growin' and showin', steady
You talkin' shit to me? You must don't know who you fuckin' with
See what I'm saying; Ganksta Nip means "DOOM"
Mercenary plus a ninja, rifleman in a courtroom
Throats on a kite, got intentions to fight
Bodybags in the street, dogs eat good for a week
Bitch I'll shoot you in your face, you think I won't do it?
Charles Manson, Freddy Krueger, makin' babies drink lighter fluid
Yeah I'ma gangster, I ain't got time to be mushy
Keep yo' bitch out my face cause I might blow up her pussy
Graveyard in my bed, only when I get mad
Arms and legs in my closet, heads and throats in my trashbag
Talkin' that shit, you'll get beat with some switches
Blew up a convalescent center cause I hate old bitches
I try to be cool, but y'all won't leave me alone
South Park lunatic, with the mind of Jim Jones
I'm hard to beat, favorite food is raw meat
Two-Hundred blenders in my head, crushin' heads like pigs' feet

[Chorus and Break]
You'll bleed from your head to your toe
That's how it is, when you fuckin wit' a psycho
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...]
[A raging psychotic, psychopath talkin']
[...ain't playin with y'all...][K-Rino]
O-R-I-G- I-N-A-T O-R
Describe K-Rino and N-I-P
Burying new jacks, beating them blue/black
I stack a rapper anatomy higher than two shacks
In the meantime K is throttling minds
Move fast you couldn't catchup if you was a bottle of Heinz
Still spitting about 24s, hoes and bitches
Man you washed up like former dirty clothes and dishes

[Hook: Ganksta NIP]

[K-Rino]
I execute in 3D, the poltergeist in the TV
Invisible hand that slaps you when you turn off the CD
You're bye bye poppa the second you try to step to me
Tight game included, these nuts are sold separately
Systematically quick and graphically seal the fate of them
Me and Gangsta NIP beat a hundred and eighty-eight of them
Hourly accosted with dangerous diagnostics
Took the ransom money and still murdered the hostage

[Hook]

[K-Rino]
We travel land that stand for the Dandy Atlantic span
Lyrical Taliban, South Park, Afghanistan
You signed a contract now you think you're fly
But you lost your damn deal before the ink could dry
I'm in the room calculating all the rap fatalities
On a three-way phone call with my other two personalities
I ain't holding back on the drama they needed
Send your punkass home crying, "Mama, they cheated"

[Hook][Verse 1]
Put in your quarter
Now it's time for a slaughter
I can move the joystick and watch him murder his daughter
Psychopath Liu Kang, he'll leave you for dead
But Mortal Kombat will let you cut off arms and legs and heads
Now you's a killa, even if your enemy's bigger
Fatality means you get to finish the nigga
Playstation, watch for what you're facing
But you can go play Sega
But I'm gonna go get Raiden
But you can go get Sonya Blade, she's a woman
Ice cold nigga Sub Zero, now he's coming
Psycho NIP, uhh game master, I'm lyrically insane
There's some good and some evil in those video games

[Hook:] X 2
Put the quarter in, now you're on your way
Push one player, then you start to play
You must keep it real when you're tryin to win
Game over nigga, you can play it again

[Verse 2]
See I'm the man that took control
And I'm the one you'll be dealin with
Every person that you kill, see you'll really be feelin it
Healin quick, uh it's like you have a new life
Perfectly in great condition, but there's a new knife
Now it's adding, then you gon subtract one
Then you go attack one, then you go collapse one
Now you're shootin fire and ice, bullets servin em all
I'll teach you how to play Psycho NIP and murder em all
You gotta start from the bottom and rise to the top
Fight hard with combinations, finish him with a Glock
Uh, game master, I'm lyrically insane
You got some good and some evil in them video games

[Hook] X 2

[Verse 3]
Now it's a challenge, hopin that your ass ain't afraid
On stage, front page, Johnny Cage had a gauge
Move somethin, act bad, this game had a trigger
(..?..) take no shit and didn't fall none of them niggas
Hold em up, JB, funk psycho ass swing
Enemies all perish from a Scorpion's sting
Cuz I'mma Toys R Us kid, the psych ain't bumpin
Everybody plays the game while they smokin on somethin
Uh, go get your niggas, now you're feelin sorry
Psycho NIP posess the souls of a thousand dead warriors
Uh, game master, I'm lyrically insane
You got some good and some evil in them video games

[Hook] X 3[K-Rino]
Yo, there was a war in South Park
Two o'clock of daytime the sky was dark
No joke, I'm running through blacks smoke and dirt
Saw Point Blank on MLK looking hurt, he said..

[Point Blank]
Dope fiend set me up
Now I'm backtracking myself to see why I done fucked up
Bet, K-Rino, get the gat for me
I don't think I got the nuts, I wants you to dispose of me

[K-Rino]
Blank, you better think before your life crumbles
What you want me to tell Nip? (On a fear, no trouble)
Aight, man, let's get this shit straight
What tool should I use?

[Point Blank]
I prefer the .38 to the dome cause to bad dreams I'm prone
I'm tired of this world, Lord I'm ready to come home
I can't handle it, I'm so afraid I might damage it
So I drop to my knees and use it to my advantage
K, it's funny to think I was making a lot of money
Fell in love with dollar signs and I guess it growed on me
But in reality I fucked up a lot of minds
Destroyed braincells, now I'm losing mine
I'm on the edge and I'm 'bout to jump off
So I'mma sacrifice myself and take it as a loss
It was was hard to choose but I chose the bullet
K, you supposed to be my nigga, now pull it[*gunshot*]

[K-Rino]
So I bailed out and my pace sped
Running full speed while my chest and my face bled
Death busy didn't know exactly
Who I was cause he charged me with his gun pointed at me
Saying:

[DBX]
Boy, what the fuck is wrong with you K, thrusting up on me like that?
But aiyo, take this TV, Eyque's parked in the back
Boy you be flipping on all the shit
We'll have so much shit I'll have an entertainment centre in my bathroom
I heard explosions, screams and shootings
We ran here for ammo, saw keyboard pianos and ended up looting
Perfect timing like Rain Man and my main man
Came up with a game plan to steal that van, you coming or what, man?

[K-Rino]
So we ran to a shack, ten brothers broke us down with a sneak attack
From trying to fight them off, I felt a bone of my fist cracked
They tied us to some dynamite, I thought we would lose out
Till Murder1 came and blew the fuse out

[Murder1]
Murder One fear no danger
My main lady, the 380 taking out motherfuckers
Hanging in South Park car watch me and Guess
Some young punk pulled a gun to Guess' chest
(Then what happened?) I remember I was packing
I felt like Clint Eastwood but smiling while I'm capping
Yo, you know how the story goes
Mining, women, cars, booming system, ______ and foes
See, like trouble follow me
Another funeral, another brother made history
A cop came and accidental
A gunshot, I looked up, it was A.C. Chill

[A.C. Chill]
Gunfire, gun smoke, motherfucker's neck broke
But I be fucking face he choke
In South Park it gets dark, I find a sharp dart
So I stuck it in a fool's heart
Cause they tried to blow my hood up
But as fast as they step up I gotta light their ass up
And that was why and still why
I had to let motherfuckers live, now I gotta let them die
Because it's my responsibility
To shoot a motherfucker in the face if he fuck with me
A.C.'s the name you should remember
Cause I can make it hot as fuck, middle of December

[K-Rino]
So we jumped on the back of A.C. Chill's truck
Riding full speed and both of the wheels stuck
Time to pack up, load the Mac up
Went to Hiram Clarke and scooped Greek for some back-up

[Greek]
The only one drafted from hard hitting Hiram Clarke
Strapped, under my arm is a rabies infested shark
Jumped in the truck, now we headed back to South Park
It's up to me to keep this shit from spreading to Hiram Clarke
Made out a plan to stop every man in cold blood
Cop in a ____ stand drowning in the rhyme blood
Riding down Reed Road, that's when we seen them coming, shit
Nothing but lip syncers, we slaughtered their ass quick
Synchronized my watch to see how fast I can be, quick
To go against the Greek you got the mind of a flea tick
Try by the mic and die by the mic says it all
My last words with eighty gats pointed at me, "Fuck y'all!" [Gunshot]

[K-Rino]
K.O. was knocking out suckers
Nip was jumping off buildings clothes-hanging motherfuckers
I told them both to run fast
The terrorists showed up with both their faces in one mask
Grimm and Egypt-E showed up
They rode up in their ride, hit the breaks and it blowed up
Some suckers tried to get some
Here come The Beholder, I told him to bring the bomb

[The Beholder]
K-Rino, you know I got 'em
So I beat 'em down and drop them cause I don't give a fuck about 'em
As I stalk the streets of South Park
I'm ripping rappers apart cause dead men don't talk
You up against a bad guy who's up to no good
And this man wears a hood
So when I step up, step back
Cause I'm fully prepared to go all out cause I'm all that

[K-Rino]
I ran over to a phone to call C-Rock
Stepped in the booth, tried to break but the door was locked
Yo, and the place filled with gas, Ganksta Nip broke the glass
And pulled me out before it choked my ass

[Ganksta Nip]
What's up, K? What's up with you?
The seven serial psychopath South Park psycho to the rescue
You aight? Wake it up
And just for that I fiend to start fucking the country up
Piece by piece, a limb by limb
The night is dim, to live chances are very slim
Ganksta Nip, the Lord of Darkness
Now I lay me down to sleep in my holy South Parkness( *phone rings* )

It's time to mix 5th Ward, South Park and 69th Curbs
And really let a muthafucka know

(Action speaks louder)
(Action speaks louder than words)
(Action speaks louder)

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
Roll em up and I smoke em
Tried to break, so I broke em
Busted his ass in the head, that's when I grabbed him and choked him
I'm on revenge, a psychopath, the master of wreckin shit
Comes back with a body blow, hittin hard as a fuckin brick
Don't fuck with the mastermind, I'ma tell you like that
Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll still you with a bumper jack
Better yet grab a bat, apart from the pack
Then commence to beat on your head to the muthafuckin fact
I'm ragin like Manson, I'm a muthafuckin thriller
Friday 13th's my birthday, so I was a born killer
Brought up as a trouble kid, devious shit's what I shoulda did
Mom had an abortion with me, but a nigga lived
I don't fear losin life, cause life just lost me
Shadow of death keeps followin me and I can't get him off me
2 years of my life were spent in a mental health
I'm a treath to society, then again to my fuckin self
I'm losin my fuckin mind, my veins begin swellin
'Kill that muthafucka!' I hear voices in my head yellin
Me get caught in a cross, that's absurd
Your head is a tennis ball and I'm about to serve

(Action speaks louder)
(Action speaks louder than words)
(Action speaks louder)

[ VERSE 2: Ganksta NIP ]
Bodybags in the bushes, see, I tried to tell em
I just hope pretty soon that somebody smell em
My lyrics get deeper and deeper
Mack 10, 12-guage, Tec-9 plus a Street Sweeper
Nigga, Ganksta NIP's in the house
Time I see a mouse automatic spaghetti sauce
Been poor all my life, so I reach for the sky
I regret I was born, I can't wait till I die
And leave blood on the curtain
Fatal thoughts of death, suicide is certain
I kill for a quarter, lyrics deep as the water
Peace to Rodney King, I got they ass in slaughter
Insane is what I am
I'm like Silence of the muthafuckin Lambs
Ganksta NIP ain't no bragger-boaster
Migraine headaches made me sleep in a toaster
Step in my face, I'll commence the hittin
( *3 shots* ) 9 milli ain't bullshittin
Down with Seag from the 69th Curbs
Tell em, Triple 6 (action speaks louder than words)

(Action speaks louder)
(Action speaks louder than words)
(Action speaks louder)

[ VERSE 3: Willie D ]
Well, first of all..
I shock em and clock em and pop em and drop em, flop em, then I mop em
In they muthafuckin tracks is where I stop em
Unless you down with a bloody nose
Save the cussin and fussin and pointin fingers for them hoes
Talk is cheap, I catch your ass on the sneak
And hit you everywhere but under your feet
Think it's a game when it ain't
I'm lettin you talk, but bitch, I'll knock yo lips off
And get ready for your kinfolk
Your little sister be the first one to get smoked
Then I grab your grandma by her weave hair
And whip her old ass with that wooden leg she wear
I'm from the bloody 5th and that's it, trick bitch
You don't know who you're fuckin with
I break this 10 1/2 so deep in your ass
That you'll be lookin like a faggot on the rag
I'm goin for bam like Scarface and NIP
What they leave of your ass Willie D gonna rip
All of that muthafuckin talkin is for the birds
I do this ( *shots* ) cause action speaks louder than words

(Action speaks louder)
(Action speaks louder than words)

[ VERSE 4: Seagram ]
Time to be accounted for the all-words spunk
Counterfeit gangstas, pranksters and chumps
Talkin real loud in front of a crowd, dare ya
I show your punk ass, nigga, better than I can tell ya
Signin checks that your punk ass can't cash
Got your album cover full of punks wearin ski masks
Who ain't never felt froggish, you won't leap
Barkin like a bear and bitin like a flea
Busters, straight suckers, muthafuckas
Donald Goines-readin-ass wanna-be hustlers
It's Seag from Oakland, the one who lays order
Quit lyin to kick it and make a run for the border
Willie D, Bushwick, Scarface and Ganksta NIP
Gave me the tip on the niggas yappin lip
Too Black hooked me, Lil' Jay booked me
Shakin em, breakin em, makin and takin em fakin fuckin rookies
And all that loud shit, nigga, don't start
They'll find your ass chopped and stuffed in a shopping cart
Fools awake and give praise to the dark lord
Bring on the chalice, voodoo dolls and the oujia boards
Straight from the alleys of Cali, 69th Curbs
Is actions spizzeaks lizzouder thizzan wizzords

(Action speaks louder)
(Action speaks louder than words)
(Action speaks louder)Yo check this out, the Black Godfather's gonna take over the whole motherfuckin' world, see what I mean? Yeah, gangsta scene. In South Park, of course...bitch. Peace to the Terrorists

[Hook]
Ayo (I'm the Godfather) [x4]

[Verse 1]
South Park is where I started making money G
I packed a 9 millimeter and dared any bitch to fuck with me
Slanging them rocks and them keys
Left at least 50 dead niggas hanging from trees
Cuz in my hood we don't play that
Gank my dope they'll find you bleedin' with your motherfuckin' skull cracked
A nine is my best friend
Inside my closet at my house it's packed full of dead men
I see a punk ass cop I don't like
Hollow point, point blank range exploded in his wind pipe
40 grand in 30 minutes jack
Pushing kilos and kilos making my motherfuckin' pockets fat
I'm a nigga causing harm
Come short of my money, it'll cost you an arm
The book of slanging dope I'm the author
You better not fuck with the Black Godfather

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The FBI wants my head so they watch me
But my money's still coming, man them hoes can't stop me
Ain't down with me you get one chance
One chance only, you snitch, call the motherfuckin' ambulance
You know what happened to the last nigga snitching
They found his wife's head cut off, laying in the kitchen
His son was found dead with a cut up face
[Dope-E] What about his little girl?
[Ganksta NIP] She got smothered in a suitcase
Another hit somebody's ganking my shit
Break out the nine and shoot til they motherfuckin' head split
Chop 'em down and yell timber
And if you can't get them, get their family members
Too many hits I'm losing business
So I get some new connections, solo, without a witness
80 grand a fucking day
I'm clocking 20 grand on a motherfuckin' bad day
The Godfather, niggas can't ignore me
I got so much clout, I got niggas that'll die for me
Cuz I'm the Black Godfather
Had a nigga bumped out cuz he was short a fuckin' quarter
I kill niggas for sport
I shoot my own momma if she come up short
The book of slanging dope I'm the author
You better not fuck with the Black Godfather
Or I'll kill your ass...

[Dope-E]
Look look look, lemme tell you something nigga. You never learned my lifestyle of living. I started from nothing. Ain't nobody give me shit. And ain't nobody help me get shit. So you can't tell me shit. Anyways, you don't know where I'm at, cuz you ain't been where I been. Do you understand where the fuck I'm coming from?

[Verse 3]
They say I'm destined for hell, but so what
I got money in my pockets bitch, I don't give a fuck
You can say what you wanna say
But if I pull out my gun, "Please don't shoot!" is what you're gonna say (ack!)
You hoes steady talking that shit
You can't get the police, cuz they're on my payroll bitch
A crazy-ass dope man
Rollin' with Scarface, the Terrorists and the Peter Man
People say I shouldn't have said this
They'll find their family shot up, in the living room headless
When I'm mad niggas get lit up
"Godfather ain't shit!" [gunfire] Nigga get up!
I don't play when it comes to my dope
Ask that nigga they found dead laying with his neck broke
I'm going to hell yeah, that's how I figure
But while I'm on earth, imma be a rich nigga
So I slang and slang, always packing a gun
Before I die I'll pass the business to my son
And then I'll teach him the ropes
Cuz a nigga can't get shit unless he slang dope (Word)
Selling kilos and carry a trigger
Before you die kill at least 300 niggas
The book of slanging dope I'm the author
You better not fuck with the Black Godfather(CHORUS)(4x)
"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
Why I live so wild"
"Here's what they think about cha"

Proceed with caution, take heed
The cops are always tryin to make a young playa bleed
So wet them motherfuckers cause they do talk shit
We been gettin slaughtered, so Rodney King whaddant new bitch
Devil, watch the Psych get nifty
Make no mistake it was a reflection of the sixties
That when niggas got beat down in the slavery days
But now in '96 we call it bravery days, check it out
So many motherfuckin murders and jacks and
So many motherfuckin burglars with gats man
Hell town, call it horrible Houston figure
Space shuttle blew up busta NASA got the money nigga
What's really happenin' fool, the youth don't mean shit
"Why does the devil lie?" It means the truth don't mean shit
The media molds us, the government controls
The judge and jury, plus the jail house holds us
Much love for my niggas that's been locked for a long crime
G la ma B.C. been locked for a long time
Ganksta NIP a brother that's known to be hype though
When I die, I'm goin out shootin a cop and goin out like a psycho
In this crimewave

(CHORUS)

Life is a jungle I'm ready to slaughter
You see this bitch, don't let her kids sink in the water
I give a shot to the battered lives
I give a shot to the battered wifes
There's a picture in my mind of some niggas that mob
There's a picture in my mind of banks gettin robbed
Ok I'll start lootin at the Shrubstown Mall
You got some money cause I just don't close my Audi y'all
Yellow tape wasn't enough for the red line
Nigga hide that banana clip to the AK you know its fed time
If you shoot a devil, would you keep steppin?
They couldn't convit you if they couldn't find the murder weapon
A stolen car, plus the music is gone
Dark black 'Lac tight white interior, car phone
Drop top bumper kid plus fifth wheel grill
Surround by sound wasn't handy Randy sing a song his ass got killed
So make the devil respect us
The same thing that happened in L.A. is gonna happen in Texas
Punk nigga let me start this shit
Flip the script, psycho NIP, conjur Moses here to part this bitch
Against the psych situation is no win
Peter Jennings, have you ever had a nigga kick yo door in
Schools in white hoods, are so so big
But schools in the black hoods, man look what they did
But in reality I'm really goin crazy
Food stamps and recards, they makin us lazy
Cities are bein ripped these soldiers are brave
And pray to God that I would not become a victim of this crimewave

(CHORUS)

Some niggas sell dope to support their child
Some niggas sell dope to support their material style
Across the street I heard a vicious hollar
Two people murdered for under less than a hundred dollars
I heard the cops been actin' a fool around the way
Jump out boys hit seven houses in one day
In South Park we keep they ass in suspense
Time you see 5-O you time another nigga hittin the fence
Back in the days she gave the busta spark
Stupid motherfucker didn't know he robbed Rosa Parks
Check game devil, what is you hawkin about
Harriet Tubman freed the slaves so what the fuck is you talkin 'bout
Psychotic rapper let me show you how to be
It's beats like this that bring the psych shit outta me
Shit, peep ya boy as I come from the heart
David Copperfield could not perform the bullshit tricks in South Park
Then you know about the Psych Ward, the sinister legion
Billboard rap artist the southwest region is bein
Takin over by a genius crock
The people are in a trance the crime rate won't drop
Nigga until the cops drop

(CHORUS)

The crimewave won't stop until everybody drop[K-Rino]
Yo, you can give a man a brain, but will he think?
I give him water like the rain, but will he drink?
I hit the punk with everything but the kitchen sink
The Universe is like a chain, I'm the missing link
Every time I open up my book
I'm reading with my eyes but I used my eyes to look
Seeing with my intellect I travel to the deep
My brain draws a picture even when I fast asleep
Sketching, like an architect, a building made of thoughts
Comprehending wisdom years before it's even taught
Talent makes the master kick a rap or even scene
The writer metamorphosize into Stephen King
Time is running out but I won't let 'em see the clock
Decipher spirit codes and the take the form of kilo rock
Conditions make me realise that niggas coming soon
Got hype in outer space and rode around across the Moon
Vocally I'm powerful, I catapult through space
Words disintegrate across a tonne of toxic waste
Physically as well as mathematically precise
Yesterday a psychic called and asked me for advice
K-Rino is too aerodynamically equipped
Witness a rage he stage, niggas pages ripped
Vocals I dissimulate the victim like they're slow
The slightest touch is equal to a thousand Tyson blowsI have one question for the whole wide world
Is, do yaw like scary movies?
It seems to me yaw do
Freddy and them, I'm jealous of them nigguz man
Know what I'm sayin? For real

Guns cocked, a nigga dropped shot in his head
It don't stop til his body rocked shot in his leg
Hold him down on the ground
Then we all take turns
And you would think we were squishing on worms
I'm on that dip nigga nip nigga gotta an AK
Watch me hypnotize the earth make em do what I say
And make the good people rich
And the others don't bother
Make the evil start killin up there mothers and fathers
And fuck America, now the psych is steppin on toes
Bill Clinton got at least twenty-seven more hoes (yaw don't believe me)
Short ?? take a life, an eye for a brain
While cats in the mortuary seem untamed
Kinda scary, Sleepin by them graveyard bones
Its just the way they just sit in the tombstone
Crooked cops the brutality would stop
If we all came to gather and just did like Pac, and bust

Do you like scary movies (yes) 4X

And I'm the psychopath ready for war
And I'ma let the nigga go if his keys in the car
Everyday mind state I call it psych mentality
Set it straight, Norman Bates is the psycho reality
Casualty, nigga thirsty for blood
Two pit bulls locked up, one just bled like a flood
Break 'em up let 'em go again give him respect
I saw 'em LOCKED in the same spot twitching his neck
My bad attitude I'm not in the mood
Searchin, for a body so the birds can have food
Nigga, drag him down the street
Til his ass says please
Concrete hurtin when its scraped to the knees
Do You Like Scary Movies
I'm switchin to psycho
The darkside... Freddy, Jason, Michael, and chuckie
Candy man, Leather Face young g
These killas will never die cause they live throw me (nigga)

Hook 4X

I see brains hangin, it went throw a phase
Some of yaw take notes
While some of yaw graze
The rest of yaw muthafuckas just form one line
Psycho club showin love and you can have some of mine
Don't try to play me at my show or think I'ma ho
Don't make reenact movies at my muthfuckin show
And start bustin like a psychopath, reloadin clips
Newspaper read 22 slaughtered by NIP
The psycho in side of me conceals itself
But the moment that there's drama it reveals itself
A new man understand with a whole new plan
D-E-A-T-H my man
The sound of a body part popped like a pistol
And most chain saws cut straight to the gristle
Keep dancin, movin, the beat sounds groovy
Don't trip muthfucka you done seem a horror movie

Hook 4X

Hell yea
Hell yea we love 'em 4XPsych Daddy, can me and my three friends come and play with you
Tonight?
Oh yeah, you and your three friends can come play with me
Tonight, and you and your three friends can come pay with
Tonight, you know what I'm sayin?
Big Syke, you know what I'm talkin about
Erotic, exotic, and a little.....psychotic

[Verse 1]
Picture a room where a con lives, it's dark inside
Newspaper clippins on the wall, from vics that died
Blood everywhere, you can tell the psycho went through
He had darts in their faces up to number fifty two
Psycho Uh, stalkin niggas, butcher knives stays handy
He would sit inside the park, and laugh and give kids candy
They say he was weird, but the bodies he killed
He always scratched off the names of the people he killed
Real slow, Pysch torture style, pass me the scissors
And cut off microscopic pieces like a mirror
Terror screams, let me know the spinal was crumbled
By the gestures they made and the words that they mumbled
Maybe I can slice a throat when I'm ready
It takes practice, training to keep a nail gun steady
You should yell when it clicks, cuz blood finna seep
And bring a hundred thousand mourners and children to weep

[Chorus] X 8
Erotic and exotic
And a little psychotic

[Verse 2]
Graveyards in my slaughter house (.?.)
Mutilation and bacteria to straight cats (?)
You can bet that yours is full of healthy humans and mice
Kinda lookin like a fleshy big pot fulla rice
Twenty people dead, strangled, uh that's my hobby
When I die you think I'm dead, but I really switched bodies
I'm standing there, watchin, they put him in the ground
Blow a sweet when it's over, I'll go kill downtown
Cops don't understand, they thought he was bluffin
They say the officer went crazy when he murdered a dozen
Other cops and didn't (?) cuz life ain't fair
They put his body in the chair, but his mind wasn't there
Soul snatcher, got cha, hit him with a heavy right
Hold him, hug him, hit him with a heavy pipe
Burn him, scorch him, you can bet the people saw it
Leave him there for thirty minutes, you'll see the birds (?)

[Chorus] X 8[Chorus: repeat 2X}
Gotta get out of the game, I gotta get out of the game
I gotta get out of the game of slangin' the caine
I gotta get out of the game, I gotta get out of the game
I gotta get out of slangin' muthafuckin' caine

[Dope-E]
I try to get out, but I can't stop
I knock on wood and pray I don't get popped
Nigga livin' lifestyle, don't try to do me
Tha cops made a bust so my dope I had to chew it
I almost blew it, damn dat was close
So I relocated to anotha post
I can't get caught, I've been in jail too many times
Can't get legit jobs so I swing to get mines
I'm in it to win it, if ya gank me I get ya
And two weeks later they find ya floatin' in a bayou
Yo' family, they're cryin', awwh it's too bad
You've been laid in muddy water, eaten by crawdads
This posse found out it was me so now they're after me
A bunch of pussies, they offend to fuck wit me
Cuz then I'll have to shoot 'em, the splatter fleshes drama
Do it mafia style and kill all these fuckin' mamas
King of the kingpins collectin' a payroll
You fuck me and I shoot ya, then cement ya ankles
Cuz I got a rep for takin' no shit, bitch
A serial killa some ya can't fuck wit
And hoes love a dopeman wit money
But all they get is this black pipe cause I ain't no dummy
They track a bro while he up and dis 'im when he down
That's why I cum in they ass, laugh and skip town
"No way cuz the game's here" so many dispute
Bitch get out my face, I'll pull yo' hair out by the roots
Yo' boyfriend owe me money, if ya love 'im betta tell it
I wants my muthafuckin' shit before I kill 'im!

[Chorus]

[Ganksta NIP]
Fuck gettin out, my reputation astound
If my money ain't legit, yo' mama's heart gets ripped out
Ya wanna gank me but ya ain't slick
"Come short one rock?", Oh man naw, ya fiend to die, bitch
It ain't funny, ya think I'm a ho?
.357 to yo' head, why U ain't laughin' no mo'?
Now it's too late, bitch look what ya did
Now here's a [bang] to yo' head, [rat-a-tat-tat] for yo' grandkids
Cops try to control me
It takes 852 jail cells to hold me
Dis Nip? Oh, fuck I'ma dis ya
A Uzi in my hand, yo' family gon' miss ya
I ain't the one to be fucked wit
9mm holopoint cappin' yo' ass, bitch
That crooked cop, he must think that I'm soft
I might start by shootin' up his muthafuckin' house
Got a kilo in my trunk wit sum lead
Mac-10 infrared scope aimed at a cop's head
Niggas geekin' and kidz geekin' too
"Just say no", Bitch fuck you!
The Godfather, I'm alwayz scopin'
Got them bitches in my bed wit their pussy wide open
A nigga snitched, he fucked my connection
They found parts of his daddy's head in every direction
Here come the jump-out boys, let 'em jump out
I'll get the Uzi, Dope-E ya get the bomb out
And let's blast in the dark [rat-a-tat-tat]
36 crooked cops just died in South Park

[Chorus]

[Dope-E]
Creepin' down the street there wit no caine just the other day
There go that nigga who owe me money, I yell "Hey!"
He heard my voice so he bailed down the street
Cuz he know his ass is fiend to get beat
Over the head wit a lead of a gun, teach 'im don't run
That's the way a nigga be slangin up in Houston
Hey yo, Nip, grab the pipe, get yo' back and a gat
[gunshots] Watch his guts splat, fuck it and that's that
Keep my finga on a trigga steady watchin' my stash cash
Gotta move fast cuz cops be watchin' my black ass
See I ain't got a pity over anotha brotha
I'll kill yo' bitch ass and I'm serious than a muthafucka

[Ganksta NIP]
Dope! (Whatta?) Get the muthafuckin' scope
(Got it!) Don't stop shootin', the twenty niggas crawl
Takin' no shit while I'm slangin'
Gank me, they'll find yo' muthafuckin' lil' girl's throat hangin'
Drugs related killings, cops don't bother
16 die from the hands of the Godfather
Lettin' ya know I ain't down for braggin'
Call 911, fuck it, call the meatwagon
You'll die fuckin' wit my dope
Like that nigga they found dead bleedin' wit his neck broke
Slangin' caine ya can never fail
But me and Dope-E see yo' ass in hell, bitch![Ganksta Nip]
Gee Bob, If I wouldn't have went inside of that Luby's guy
I would still be alive guy
If I was, that guy David Koresh guy
Which is me? What I did I'd still be alive
Charley Manson, I'd still be alive. You know what I'm talkin bout?
Peep this game, there's no way you can escape, death
So the only way you can escape death. You gotta do good

[Verse One]
It don't matter what your name is
Push and you shove
You know death is promised to us from the man up above
Ain't no way you can stop it
So God be with ya
Your life will flash in front of your FACE
Went the reaper come get cha
Remember when you were alive you said that things will change
Six feet deep, your in the casket talkin bout things feel strange
Ain't nobody gon' heal your we celebrate when we kill ya
And if you got up out that casket, would nobody come near ya
But if you walked up to me and tell me you didn't sin
I might just gon' insane and cut your brain and kill you again
Psycho Nip Psychopath, J-Slash with the tracks
But when you die, your soul with fly, there's no more comin back

(Hook)

No matter who you are
Even if you are a star
If you drive a nice car
Of if your house is made of straw
You'll get the graaaveyard
You can't escape the graaaveyard

If you can't take it no mo'
Cause you dont have no cash flow
It don't matter don't you know
If you are rich or if you are po'
You get  the graaaveyard
You can't escape the graaaveyard

[Verse Two]
Shoots you in the head if you try to take mind
I don't give a fuck I don't mind dying
You know nuthin but money stays on my mind
Psych Ward nigguz gon' pack the nine
Psycho Nip makin history, and I know these haters are feeling me
I heard you talk about killing me but you'll die first you would live to see
The enemies run from the Psych Ward crew
Real home boys, I might have two
If you get mad hit the brew, keep this in mind that i will kill you
Anybody kills I'm busting lead, lady screamed out somebody is dead
Paramedics came the person bled
Messin with the Psych you'll keep losing your head
[??] brothers that are down with it, use the ??? brothers that drown with it
Taunt the Psych I'm bound to hit it, drop your gun I'mma clown with it
You can't escape J-Slash with the tracks
But when you die your soul will fly, there's no more comin back

(Hook)

Ay, you know what I'm sayin?
I got much love for the South side
Much love for the north side, east coast, west coast, midwest
I got love for the veto's
Know what I'm sayin? It's all love
Ya'll muthafuckas better out there better get ya'll life together
Cause if ya'll don't... It's a new millennium (it's a new millennium)
And we gotta make sure man, we're in the right mind state
Cause the wrong mind state, can get you caught up in judgment with God
And that leaves, and that leaves, to a quick, deathHolograms - 11x

OK motherfucker, I'm pissed to the max
A Texas typhoon horror 30 blade torture axe
Bitch ass devil, its murders I'm bringing 'em
A reborn foot soldier, thirsting for craniums

Psycho, catch my drift
I'll come up to your kids,click-click and conjure a quick death
Rip out your face cause I take shit serious
He said something about my mama, by that time I'm delirious

Bring on the spirits, I'm a spiritual man
Sacrificing the devils, ???, so lets join hands
All praise to psychos,eating flesh is a hobby
Holiday inn homicides,hundreds of heads in the lobby

Surgery, the surgeon said lets go
He saw the corpse and said dont call me for this shit no mo'
Peel his cap back, this bitch nigga want to riff
Only on my command, we throwing his motherfucking ass up off a cliff

Rough slice from a knife, hold him up
Paramedics were scared, the coroner said I'll roll him up
Niggas that oppose me, you fought out this jam
Of evil spiritual illusions with ghostly physical holograms

I'm having holograms! - 4X

Watch as the Psyche destroys like a flood
Even though my pen writes in black
It seems like it writes in cold blood
For the pain that they give
Time I change my voice, white people die if they want to live

Now as I wake up the dead
I grab him by the face and ??? into the back of his head
Its crushed, like the butcher do meat
Manic depressive monster inside my mind ready to be unleashed

Death is like transforming a rhyme
Appear holy spirit in the form of Dr Psyche-instein
This is something I couldn't dodge
Look at all those astronauts flying there to peep the Gods

This is serious, my brain is a jail
Walking through the tunnels of my mind is like walking in hell
I had this talent since birth
At this moment right now Farrakhan is the wisest man on earth

Movies, seen one came around
Ink pen so evil, it weighed a thousand fucking pounds
Hes the sheep, disguised as a shepherd
Gun already loaded, we could get up in that mangy leopard

Step with the quickness,the deuce-five is dissing you
Duck from the bullets but the javelin ain't missing you
Pissing you off, scrape up the blood from the floor
Tidal wave came so quick it soaked up 50 people or more

Now do I make myself clear?
East and West coast murder rates so high I feel it down here
So many styles and then
When the constitution was wrote that was death from an ink pen

I'm having holograms - 5x

(NIP talking)
A hologram is just a state of mind. You see a
Picture thats really not there. Or is it really???

(NIP-evil voice)
Demented voice, demented style
Step to the devils demented chosen child
One by one all devils get dropped
Split open my chest
Squeeze my lungs until my heart stops

Pyscho ass nigga watch this fool go left
Somebody mutilate my body so I can show you it heals itself
Raging beast, raging beast
Blow up the elementary I'll bet we have peace-Kill

Enemies died, that is no lie
He dissed the coalition, ammunition Lil Frye
High off this weedGanksta Nip is not a sucker(?)
A psyche ward in 96 dead from an inkpen motherfucker

I'm having holograms - 5X (holograms) 14x
