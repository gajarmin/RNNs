[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyyo, you betta flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumping like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if the crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go BOOM BOOM, and yo' guns go pow-pow
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shottie smoking
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to getting nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy don't make it thirty-six
Step to this you're good as gone, word is bond
I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]
So put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn
C'mon put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it on represent put it on, C'MON!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothing from Big L but a loss chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast the shottie
Got more cash than Gotti, you don't know, you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Ha ha, you'se a funny nigga
I flows so one of my shows, wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leaving competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catching wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo it's a must that I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]

[Bridge: Patois Chatta]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead, from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moet not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangster lean I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm putting rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
Cause I be hanging in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slamming, I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town, and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
Cause we put it on, adi√≥s, ghost I'm gone[Intro]
Who y'all talkin to man?
Uhh
Check it out, check it out
This here goes out
To all the niggas that be fuckin mad bitches
In other niggas cribs
Thinkin shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on your ass, hahaha
Live niggas respect it, check it

[Verse 1]
I kick flows for ya, kick down doors for ya
Even left all my motherfuckin hoes for ya
Niggas think Frankie pussy whipped, nigga picture that
With a Kodak, Insta-ma-tak
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
Sweetness, where you parked at?
Petiteness but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that, I'm fuckin with you
The bitch official doe, dick harder than a missile yo
Try to hit, if she trippin disappearin like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a connivin stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'm a peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Television's, Versace heaven, when I'm up in em
The shit she kicked, all the shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressin me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playin gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112, CD blast, I was past
She came twice I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, sayin "I'm smokin on home-grown"
Then I heard her moan, "honey I'm home!"
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad I know he won't like this
Now I'm like, "Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him, arm, leg."
She beggin me to stop but this cat gettin closer
Gettin hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, uhh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, "Honey bring me up somethin to drink!"
He go back downstairs more time to think
Her brain racin, she's tellin me to stay patient
She don't know I'm, cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will though, I probably chill though
Even though situation lookin kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, "Gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope."
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin off some love potion shit
Flash the heat on em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, "Don't blast here's the stash
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!"
Nigga pullin mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggas on the cell
"Bring some weed I got a story to tell, uhh"

[Outro]
Yo man, y'all niggas ain't gonna believe what the fuck happened to me. Remember that bitch I left the club with man? Yo, freaky yo. I'm up in this bitch playa this bitch fuckin run them ol Knick ass niggas and shit. I'm up in the spot though. One of them six-five niggas, I don't know. Anyway I'm up in the motherfuckin spot. So boom I'm up in the pussy, whatever whatever. I sparks up some lye, Pop Duke creeps up in on some, must have been rained out or something  because he's in the spot.

"Stealing runs rampant in Harlem
Gambling runs rampant in Harlem
All types of evils and uhh, vices that tear apart our community
Run rampant in Harlem"

[Verse 1: Big L]
The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin poems to have them faggots diggin hoes like Reverand Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps til they head splits, then break em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin Tecs, because I be stayin vexed
Some nigga named Dex, was in the projects layin threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin
I'm chokin enemies til they start turnin pale
Satan said I'm learnin well, Big L's gonna burn in hell
Front and get scarred cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a thievin' squad, and none of us believe in God

[Hook: McGruff/ Big L]
(McGruff:) Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
(Big L:) Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

[Verse 2: Big L]
I got styles you can't copy bitch, it's the triple six
In the mix, straight from H-E-double-hockey sticks
Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up, they said a real man
Won't hit a girl well I ain't real cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price, I'm the type
To snap in heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, cause hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit, strictly, little kids
Be wakin up cryin, yellin, "Mommy Big L is comin to get me!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big L]
I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be runnin up
"Can I get your autograph L?" No bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge; just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread pretzelhead
'fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

[Hook]Intro:
It's the number one crew in the area

[Verse 1: Big L]
The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense
Gettin' men lynched, too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all ya new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still gel me without a motherfuckin' LP

[Hook]
It's the number one crew in the area
"Known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard"

[Verse 3: Microphone Nut]
Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
I'm giving these ladies something they can feel cause I'm real
Ya man get outta line and it's kill kill kill

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Party Arty of Ghetto Dwellaz]
Yo you step up and you'll get played like the small fry
I'm throwin' niggas off the roof said you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around you'll be a dead man
I get hype tonight's the night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal, eatin' people
Not Jeffery Dahmer I'm the sequel, head or gut like Illegal
So what cha want?
Yo I'm strapped with the gats step up plap plap
I'm leavin' caps in your back fool
I rip tracks wanna say peace to hip hop
A nigga disagree bring it on and get dropped
I get wreck I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the Tec smokin' niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how I'm gettin' jewels
I say big up big up it's a stick up stick up
I stick and move

[Big L:]
And that's how we do. So I.U. grab the gat and let loose

[Verse 6 Grand Daddy I.U.]
Yo rat tat tat I got the gat cocked
Nigga we ghost man a punk?
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
I'm shootin' up like the west is
Fuck suggestions
I'll blow out a niggas intestines
Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
Cause you're marked for death[Intro: Jay Z]
How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong, nah mean?
How can a mutha fucka go round and hate a nigga
He never even met that he dont even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Y'all dont even know every day I'm living with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?
I try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars...Lucky me

[Hook: Karen Anderson]
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I hate all girls with ulterior motives
That's why I'm 20+ years old, no sons no daughters
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
Hear the hate in my voice right? I hate that you noticed
Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
Hate a nigga like that faggot, get your own
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome
Knowing one day Im'a have to flip, c'mon
You know the shit don't stop 'til the Cris' don't pop
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock
I'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact
It ain't no turning back. Bring It On
Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
Steady looking for flaws through us.... Lucky Me

[Hook: Karen Anderson]

[Bridge: Jay Z]
Since I was 4 years old, I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that I've arrived
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Nigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly
But I know any type of success breeds envy
I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hem me
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny
But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up
Don't grieve for me my art remains
Like a dart from the speaker to your heart
Spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal
Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life
Though I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife
Next time you're thinking heist better be precise
Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here
I have no regrets even though I won't see grow
My godson Boogie, Sonny and Remo

[Hook: Karen Anderson]

[Hook: Jay Z][Verse 1: The Game]
June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She eight centimeters, my lil' man 'bout to fall
Scuffin my Air Forces, runnin through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feelin reborn, like a Bed-Stuy breddern
My first born, Dre I'm bout to have a Bad Boy
Family in the lobby, see my nigga Church, whattup
Shit, I left the camcorder in the truck
Runnin through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweatin
I swear to God every minute's startin to feel like a second
I see hell starin down the barrel of a Smith and Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a lil' hash in it
Spread my wings, if only I could fly
Why fight to live homey if we livin to die?

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
But in the end I hope you'll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming, your day is coming
I tell ya, and when it comes just keep it running
Running, just keep it running, I tell you

[Verse 2: The Game]
They say every time somebody die, a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screamin at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yellin for the doctor to come
All I can remember was Lemaze class, breathe baby
One (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)
I see the head, Doc bustin through the door
He between the legs, he see the head, it's my baby boy!
11:46 the head out, she screamin makin crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach foldin like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feelin like Mariah Carey, all these butterflies
Voices singin to me sound like Teena Marie
I'm callin niggas on tour
Jayo tell Spinz I just cut the umbilical cord
11:57, a soldier is born
And he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Caron

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]

[Verse 3: The Game]
I wanna thank Dr. Aswork and Nurse Teresa
For bringin my baby boy to life, you birthed a Caesar
And my baby momma Alyska, for pushin out a ten pound
Four ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose ears eyes chin, just like your daddy
I'd die before you grow up and be just like your daddy
Or your grandfather; call Uncle Zeb
Tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm poppin Crist' wit'cha godfathers
Baron Davis and D. Mac, Darrius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71
With my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Erin Wright, T'yanna, and Lil' Pun
Lowridin, bangin, "Ready to Die," track #1
If I bust five times, and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun
One

Doin' a 100 on a highway
Fast cake, I do it my way
Fast cake, I do it my way
Head to toe labels on deck, do it the fly way

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Predatory glory feastin' on endangered species
I take a shit right after birth a million dollar feces
Fuck ya habitat, it's really where your ratchet at
My ego is so lethal that a ? will try to damage that
So Queens that you can feel me
So dope that you could deal me
Do a donut then I hop up out the Benz
Still in the hood like ATM's that give tens
Crime infused paragraphs with expensive pens
Now we chasin' ends my niggas need extensive ends
Refined thug salary, fine rug gallery
Purchase courtesy of the street, real niggas proud of me
Strategize always think wise but never cowardly
Powerfully shower me with the finest different designers
Leanin' back were shinin' like we drivin' in recliners
It's your highness the flyest, so acrobatic were manuverin'
Catch me freak dancin' in the club, I got the Ruger in

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The kings portrait laid inside the hand car frame
Hung over the fireplace admired by the peasants
Present some evidence for things you mention in your sentences
I'm devilish, the foot is like a leather fish
Smoke wax like a Brazilian salon
Stand on the corner after three in the morn'
All thermal on, your money shorter than a gerbil's arm
Fuck around, throw a gerbil in your mom
Yo change the channel put the Ninja Turtles on
Arrange the battle, blaze the saddles
Bust your motherfuckin' ass in basketball wearin' sandals
Gun at the side by the love handles
Bring me your face so I could fuck it hard
Then do a 720 in the mustard Saab
The bitch touched my hair said I must be god
That bitch touched my hair said I must be god


[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Deluxe fresh, hop out the Lex flexin' ya ex
She's left stretched properly sexed fuck it I'm blessed
Checks comin' in, street money movin' at the same time
Gain shine whenever my feet step on the concrete
Seated outside drinkin' wine chewin' on conch meat
While cops heat corners and streets, we in the bistro
Thinkin' that ? don't fuck around I'll let my heat go
Cuban linx hand made, nigga I'm clan paid
Fuck a couple ratchets got lost to my man Rae
Seven thousand feathers in a eagle
The one I lost didn't have none but it was evil
Niggas try showin' fake love, but they be see through
Deceitful, my people
Still the same crew from back then
Sellin' drugs out the hoopty with a black Mac-10
Unique ringtones, obscure trap phones
You wack rap clones never had a backbone

[Hook]Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

[Verse 2: Terra]
Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

[Verse 3: Herb McGruff]
For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

[Verse 4: Buddah Bless]
Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

[Verse 5: Big Twan]
Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

[Verse 6: Killa Kam - Cam'Ron]
Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

[Verse 7: Trooper J]
I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

[Verse 8: Mike Boogie]
I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

[Outro: Big L]
True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew
Word upSeen it all

See you, my nigga

I seen it all

I see you, my nigga

[ VERSE 1 ]
I seen God, I seen bitches get hard
Old ladies get robbed, I seen Master Farrad
I seen niggas' wifeys slide with ball players
See my room - in different wallabees in all flavors
I even seen my dreams come through
I seen coke on triple beams and fiends come through
I seen big willies in every city
Seen 13 year olds split phillies
And spit nine millies, I seen a million
I seen niggas jack beats and make a killin
Niggas keep it real and still flop
I seen niggas' moms keep it real and buy krills on the block
This shit is real on the block
I seen Dapper Dan every week in '88
Trigger on the V-I, just the other day
One love, my nigga, seen L pass away
Now I want the cash today
Don't stash, just pass to Dre

Ghetto dimes catch the monster and shook niggas snitch
I seen niggas blow and forget where they came from
(I'm the same one)
That seen two die from the same gun
I seen my nigga lace this track from scratch
Buckwild, this shit is fat, where ya at?
I seen my friends turn to enemies
I seen peeps turn to memories
I even seen who shot Kennedy
I seen model chicks, they ate dicks
I seen the matrix
I seen the feds take flicks

They rocked em in bed
I seen N.O. niggas rockin the feds

[ VERSE 3 ]
I had a dream, I seen my girl on her knees
I seen myself cock the Desert Eeas'
(And ready to squeeze) I seen dead dopefiends
With needles in they arm
I seen your mom at her prom, she was the bomb
I seen big Porter get robbed out
No doubt, I seen my pops get puffed out
Ice and get duffed out
Another issue I gotta touch on
I even seen the President blow trees and get his fuck on
I seen niggas married and divorced
Pregnant chicks carried and flossed
Jesus carried a cross
I seen the statue carry the torch
On some sixth grade shit
I seen brains on the pavement
I seen foul niggas turn flagrant
I seen wild niggas turn agin
What a bitch
I seen buster bitches pimp pimps
And dimes fuck for free
None of y'all get a dime (if it's up to me)
Just like a chickenhead (wanna go and suck your teeth)
Just like Aretha (wanna come and fuck with me)
(Never) I seen jail, I seen bail
And I ain't goin back, so they can keep bail
Time to bounce with this female

Seen it all

I see you, my nigga[Cormega]
Your depiction of a thug nigga, is fiction
Your words hung my nigga lines were drawn
You sided with the judge I ain't a hater
I don't love squellers thats me
You have the audacity to talk like you real
Nigga you fold under pressure, my life is real
You sold your soul to detectives I could get you murdered
But you dying a slow death denying you told yet
The truth came to light you a fake nigga
You helped the D.A.'s case my nigga
Fuck your life I hate the side of your face nigga
Only a fake nigga would respect you
You went against the cause and signed papers
The signatures yours thats that bullshit pardon me
?Sammy the bullshit? take the stand betraying the fam
Should have kept it real you put your fate in ya hand
I guess thats the way it was planned

(Hook) [Cormega]
There's a a thin line between love and hate and you crossed it
You had respect around the way and you lost it
If a coward dies a thousand deaths how you gon' live?
Nigga you get no love

[Cormega]
Death before dishonor
You sacrificed your breath so respect a nigga power in jail
I get you hit up in the shower
I'm a real nigga I walk the streets with pride
I'm the truth, you living a lie
You a part-time prosecuter, full time ?hosa?
I right rhymes with great'ness you write statements nigga
And think the streets don't know
Tssk, yo it was all good just a week ago
How could you live with being the D.A.'s witness
And knowing ya names associated with snitches
You could pray for forgiveness I'mma fact you a stool pigeon
Ain't nothing you can do nigga, might I mention
Only a bitch would snitch to get a lighter sentence
Take it like a man nigga like official prints and cornbread nigga
I'm a warrior you deserve a bullet in ya head nigga

(Hook)

[Cormega]
Uhh, I'm tired of you coming through like snitching justifiable
I once admired you, you rap bastard
Ain't no need to explain you not my man
Everytime you give me five I wash my hands
What nigga, M-E-G-A bitch tell the D.A. bricks
I move in three days not including the grindin
What polluted ya mind was it alluded time
My words are exalted yours ruin lives
You a disgrace to ya race I'm true to mine
All my doggs doing time, know before I side with the law
I rather ride with the fours and deprive you of your, coward exsistence
You probably send ya momma to prison to beat a sentence BITCH!

(Hook)Artist: Capone-N-Noreaga w/ Tragedy Khadafi
Album: The War Report
Song: Black Gangstas

[Tradegy Khadafi]

Niggas scared to pull a hit
For shit, my team will know a bitch sniff a pyramid of a dollar bill, she will, 97 to the hill
Get ill, do your thing, I ain't mad at you son
It's how you feel...

[Noreaga]

Yo, blood scene, bloody my vision can't see
Straight off top, me ral and Mussolini
Was tied up, connect thinking that we wired up
Once these ropes get cut I'm getting highed up
Slow it down, you moving too fast
Kid it's the halves, you ain't know
It's illegal life shit, big bloody cash
So what you do, in due time, come back in view
That's why niggas can't relate to L.A., they stick you
Let's laundrymat this, revolution this Iblis
Keep the world in fits, my clique avoid death list
Black gangsta, 2 5 I co-perfect this
CNN, iced out piece, italian necklace
Stef bauer, you and L, yall work the hour
We all dirty, like the clique don‚Äôt take shower
There's more to get, hit the fuck up, taking power
100 channels, turn station, operation 140
Earthquake would bring glory
Noreaga, but for short just call me Nore
Catagory, point-blank end of the story

Chorus

[Capone]
Never sweat D‚Äôs, I let trees blow
Get bent on benches, hopping the fences
Here they come in long trenches, crack
Chase 'em, lace 'em, let the chef bake 'em
Jake, taste 'em, take 'em, wonder where we make 'em
Roll dice, and break 'em on the street corner
Betting stacks, holding packs,
Hoping police don't run deep on us
Peep the third floor shade that never rises
For Jake, I hold weight, plus gats in greater sizes
Bullet proof down to my Nike's now we the livest
Survivest, open offa' lah contact, combat
Twisting yer cap, and listen to rap
Postion to mack , to blow out your back
Ho's across the map, foe's eat a dick in fact
I'm a score, flip more raw than Dominique Dawes
Yea flip that

Chorus 4x

Yo black gangsta, where they at, where they at
Queensbridge and Iraq[Verse 1]
Back in the days was kinda crazy, kid I started out with nothin'
Wasn't livin' like Thanksgiving, I was turkey without the stuffin'
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the poorhouse
Say mama caught the drama, she would bleed tryin to feed 4 mouths
Wasn't rockin' Girbauds, I barely had clothes, and when it snowed
And temperatures droppin' below zero, you know I froze
No CD's, a black and white TV, a seat is a rubber tire
With a hanger for the antenna, turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin' in my cabinet, but cans of Raid
I'm knockin' on my neighbor's door
To borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid
I wasn't freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped, I'm trippin'
Cause my winter coat got lost buttons
And zippers that wouldn't stay zipped
I never remembered ?, the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black, I had kit-kats on top of crackerjacks
Walkin' the streets, with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldn't speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin' humped from the stunts, I always struck out
The ones you like says take a hike if you can‚Äôt pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world

[Hook]
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, youknowhatI'msayin? I'm blowin' up in the world

Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, yeah...

[Verse 2]
It seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back
"Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road Jack"
Black, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona
With a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin' than Tony Roma's
In order to get straight, I gots ta to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin' down on the corner slangin' fat rocks to bottles
With the black tops, for cops got my shorty watchin' my back Hobbes
Makin' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton & gucci
Hoochies callin' me boochi, while they smooch me, givin' up the coochie
Now I'm a felon, started sellin' and splittin' melons
I started gellin', to tellin' police just cause I was swellin
Hangin' out on the corner playin' cee-lo, rollin' for half a kilo
Yo you'll never see G-low a-goin below
Yeah, straight gettin' fortunate,  as long as fiends was torchin' it
It started gettin' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin' it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
Cause business is drugs is gettin' too risky
So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch up tramps diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, "It's a Demo"
And started chillin' in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin', no time for pages, sportin' gold chains and rings
Clockin' money and fame, nothin' changed, I'm still the same
Just spendin' 20's and 10's at women pullin' on my linen
And grinnin' cause I was winnin' in this game from the beginning
The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills
I turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos
Though my dough used to be low, now I puff on cigars and blow Mo'
So catch a flashback, of a G. Rap track, attacked, like a head crack
That's smack, through your cap, with the lead black
And here's a new cut, for pooh-butt, rappers hangin' from off my
Two nuts like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G. Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's witcha girl
Straight up kid, I'm blowin' up in the world

[Hook](Hook)
Checkin' my style, return to zero
Checkin' my style, return to zero
Checkin' my style, return to zero
Got zeros checkin' my style
Checkin' my style, get gunned up and clapped quick
Zeros get gunned up and clapped quick
Checkin' my style get gunned up and clapped quick
Typical ignorant rap shit

(Verse 1: Johnny Napalm)
Explosive, Napalm dropping off
With a waterfall full of tomahawks
Put them into ya, like the Taj Mahal
Leave them with obituaries and a monologue
I'm critically acclaimed, and lyrically insane
Flow through the conscious, get the feeling in ya brain
All in your head, rearrange your cortex
Stay in your lane, strain on the brakes then floor it
Oughta leave the streets, don't speak your piece
Throw frags at them, backtracking through the frequency
Easily a deity in the modern day
But really, a legend like Dr. Dre
Nasir, Big Poppa, Lamont, and Jay
All my congregates, before and after
Immortal rapper born to dominate
Only built for Cuban links, some rocks, and chains
Not today, I'm built for a purpose
The skills in my verses, can put real niggas in the hearse
And fuck mass appeal to suburban
I'm a lyrical machine concealed as a person
To bust a rhyme, yelling "fuck a nine
To five," At fourteen, I'm above your time
This luck of mine is not for the faint of heart
Who's your top 1, nigga, name me off

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Johnny Napalm)
Might get your wig pushed back tonight
Meet your afterlife when I attack the mic
Scrap and fight MC's with a tactical knife
Destroy all rappers in sight, better grab for a rife
Take this L when you get boxed in the ring
I'm the prodigy of Nas and Rakim
But probably, the coming of the God MC
Drop and cease, land on the side of me
Lock and squeeze, put 5 in your chest
9 and the Wes', then he died on the steps, 2
My 16's like a lethal weapon
Heat seek selection, screaming bring the rest in
Enter 36 chambers of elimination
Endangered, doomsday's been initiated
Sinister ancient flows, and mission statements
Status: Napalm started shifting, shaping
To a griffin, dragon, destroy the masses
Wait a minute, make them listen
Won't be in celebration when I hoist your casket
Deploying fragments of my voice in static
Not yet, keep these in your conscience
Drop knowledge like the second Mohammed
Lyrical prophet, protect ya neck
When I flex, best expect it's a bomb threat

(Hook) X2[O.C.]
Yo, fuck having my neck dripped, with jewels that don't mean shit
This man behind his rhyme is the nigga that's slick
Licking my thumbs, counting papers from my street-smart wigs
In the club we ?hub rows? taking some flicks
Pushing the same whips niggas got with platinum stacks
Two LP's far from gold, you people think I'm selling crack
Nah, they see me living with a smile on my face
And if you see me in the spot I'm down low in the place
Sipping my liquor, Remi Martin running through my liver
Sucking, all in and feels, the shit tastes bitter
Having fun, for that particular time and date
I feel I'm almost to the point, so I calmly skate
Fuck all the broads, fuck all the cats who appluad my name
Who wouldn't give me no love if I wasn't in the game
I'm full of suprises, analyze the all wise
Ricarders protect my eyes when I'm dipping
On the BQ my Benz see through
Fuck tints, I'm live nigga, and so is my people
Half of me is godly, the other half is evil
So if it comes down to it, I'm strapped and we do it, feel me

[Jay-Z]
Love is life and life is love
Real live niggas and bonafied thugs
Career criminals with ice-grilled mugs
Not afraid to shed blood to bleed, I believe because (Repeat 2x)

[O.C.]
Yo, I try to live my life right, Earth is like the tree of life
Tempted by the forbidden fruit of my face, I want to take a bite of it
It looks sweet, making my mouth water, then I thought
Of a foul thought of filming somebody daughter on camcorder
She of age but her mind's in the cage
Fuck my man and my man and my man, for no wage
Savage cause, Devil's got me locked by the balls
Inside my soul, good and evil fighting a war
Mixed feelings like Remi and cranberry a man
How will he fall if I shoot him dead where he stand?
I'm thinking like Charles Manson, dreaming of Marilyn Manson
Praying over my grave, deep with the klansman
Roots of evil coming in shapes and forms
I cannot identify what's right or what's wrong
All I know is sometimes I fiend for dough, fiend for clothes
And fiend for hoes backstage at my shows, uh

[Jay-Z]
Love is life and life is love
Real live niggas and bonafied thugs
Career criminals with ice-grilled mugs
Not afraid to shed blood to bleed, I believe because (Repeat 2x)

[O.C.]
Yo, life is full of lessons that we all must learn
Take head and pay attention cause of drastic turn
Can be just around the corner, waiting coming dead on
In the pit, so how ya living in the path you're on
It's in the cards being dealt, I want the best for me
It's Love, Hell or Right, O.C. has a destiny
To be the best that I can be, that means giving my all
I'm too intelligent and bright to be taking a fall
I'm 20 some odd years old, young, black, and I'm fars
I'm living to see some grandkids and die of natural cause
Retire somewhere living in the Keys of Fla
Sipping on Coors, all in happy, spitting tobacco from my jaws
The price of hard living, hard work, granted you're given a chance y'all
Succeed and advance far
Taking advantage, opportunities is right in your face
Avoided unless driven to murder was the case, uh

[Jay-Z]
Love is life and life is love
Real live niggas and bonafied thugs
Career criminals with ice-grilled mugs
Not afraid to shed blood to bleed, I believe because (Repeat 2x)[Verse 1]
Like the dead end kids, we used to play in the streets
Never worryin about grief, football spelled relief
Ronnie Ritney was the coach for us
See he taught us to play, almost every single day, OK
Now on Evergreen was Larry and Mike and Lon
My cousin Boo lived there too just to name a few
With Sha-rone, he's bad to the bone, Boo's little sidekick
And a badass mouth, he used to feist it on Harmon Street
With Zach, Leo and Ed
Me Jody and Boop by June, Rocky and then comes
Tommy and Cedric, Lamont and Greg, unique in our own right
At times we'd fight, but that's a-ight
Still, not realizin we had love, it showed
When we played, no phony charades against
One another, now while I write this song
It's like some are still alive and a couple are gone

[Hook (4X)]
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why

[Verse 2]
As kids, you're overlookin death
It didn't seem important or serious, it just seems curious
It was about, wakin to a bowl of cereal
Cartoons on Saturday's, karate flicks, and like
Ridin your skateboard, or bicycle
And went as deep as Killa Joe on the corner drinkin Ripple
Plus, Puerto Rican kids on the block were cool
We got along, we all knew right from wrong
By far, we got a dose that life was hard
A Spanish we were close with, was killed by a car
Shocking, Alberto was hit, on the block and
Death was spontaneous, his moms was clockin him 'cross the street
He just received an award
For Little League baseball like an hour before, plus
He didn't even get to see the summer set in
Dyin all young at the age of seven
It opened up my eyes small that the flesh was weak
As a kid, thinkin shit like that was mad deep, peep it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now when somebody is gone, that's when you realize how close you was
How close you are.. like a star
Real deep it takes time to heal
And still from time to time you wish you could find the way to forgive
And let him know you forgave
But they can't feel six feet deep inside the grave
What's left, but attend his wake, believin if it was you
He'd do it for old time's sake, damn
I'm disturbed, by the news when I was told I was sittin
Knowin damn well Boo ain't bullshittin
My life flashed like big bills of cash
And good times we had, now it's all so sad
One of my childhood pals hit the road
When you take, to the streets, then you die, by the code
But in this case, who knows what went down?
Bottom line is wishin that he still was around
Now he found a spot in my heart, or should I say lobotomy
Mike, know you're trapped inside of me
And every other brother in Bushwick
Who rushed to your side thick, all down with the click
Yeah, God Bless he laid to rest
Call him Mike Boogie, that's what describes the nigga best

[Hook]

We're born to live (4X)

"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!

Verse One: Grand Puba

Now as I blast off with my curricula, comin perpendicular
Watch me kill it when I spill it, top bill it, shine like acryllic
Actions manifest with the strategy of chess
Hit you with more retardedness than the seed born from incest
Since the scrotum I was that brother
Ripped a hole in my daddy's rubber
Swan dived into my mother
Left behind a thousand others
Caught one cat sittin in the egg, tossed him out he slid down the leg
Born months later, I come ridin down the escalator
The doctor tried to smack me but I caught him with a two piece
My pops said, "Son you did it right, aww man my shorty tight"
Then he passed the brother a mic and ever since my flow been tight
Come on -- you gotta be kidding me if you think Brand Nu' lost a step
And if you do go get a late pass cause you cats done overslept
Over two thousand emcees attend school at Haji Prep
Brand Nubian brothers, A alike, B alike, plus we see/C alike
Cause ain't nuthin but that blazeness when these brothers touch the mic

[Jamar] Now who comin with that hot shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
[Jamar] Who about to rock shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!

"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
[Jamar] Who about to rock shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
[Jamar] Super splashy with that head knot
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!

Verse Two: Lord Jamar

The rap legend, never pushed a Legend, gripped the mic
With my bredderns, like Kryptonite we steal your powers
Like Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos we come back
To reveal the seventh seal, the drum track's the soundtrack
For war -- hardcore righteous, the nicest
Comin with advice that's priceless, to help the crisis
It was felt by some, you wouldn't like this
Now we got you strung like you sniffin that white bitch
Flippin the tongue, even at a high pitch, we run
Shit like diarrhea, we burn that ass like gonorrhea
You learn your past through the eyes of the overseer
Me, I earn my cash tellin the truth
They wanna make a felon out of every black youth
My nigga Stick Man got the cracked tooth, steady yellin
In the booth, we got big plans to make loot
Waitin for the seeds we plant to take root

"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!

Verse Three: Sadat X

I'm here seven nights a week, no charge, and for
Two drink minimum, the Wild Cowboy number one
With them C-Town and Manhattan street pose
To they dancers on Thursday's for all the lost souls
Laid out in bed she offering, don't want the pussy
Fell for the hype but now I wanna stretch her
Cause her convo is slow, there's a lot of shit she don't know
But she young and firm, she'll learn
We hit them niggas in the middle of the month, check day
And in a future life I will probably pay
But who's to say, cause I'm right here today, and death to spray
You wanna get some smoke see my man Jose
You want somethin stronger got to wait a little longer
From the Harley Houses to the Brasley Houses
To my City Park youth throwin rocks off the roofs
And my sons downtown, they don't give a fuck
Let the flames off from inside of the truck (BLOW)
My OT pipeline will stop your lifeline
Make your wife blind and best in your lifetime (no doubt)[Intro]
(It's nineteen ninety now and there's certain individuals
Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle)

October 26
It's Nineteen Ninety Now, motherfuckers

[Verse 1]
So here I am, in the spot you probably wish you was
It's a few haters, but damn if I ain't getting love
You see my fan base, you see them quoting bars
You see them bringing up my name saying "He goin' hard"
He took some time to make an album
Now he's back in effect and motherfuckers wanna out him
A lot of rappers got my face on they dart board
But they don't start war cause I'm the hardest of the hardcore
Tin-man don't need foil, metallic, exo-skeleton when heat boils
Leave you in the sun till your meat spoils
The beat boils, Buckwild bakes the heat rocks
While you soft though, I'm pulling back the crossbow
(And y'all know)
The game's saturated and crowded
But you don't hear us bitching, instead we did something about it
Made an album with the same ingredients as many classics known
The golden era rap fans who love echoing saxophones

[Verse 2]
A concept first of it's kind
Imagine if we combine me, with the murderous rhymes and tracks from a earlier time
(oh yeah)
In the climate of rap where heads are lost
But over here we stay focused and make exactly what we want (yes)
Buck ain't just Diggin' The Crates (nah)
He dug straight into the shoe boxes of floppy discs
And found some jewels so I can rock the shit
Shout out to James D.L. for havin' a vision of a magical wizard castin' angry spells
Aimin' these shells at the state of rap music
Trying to change the people and trying to change they view of it
The faggot art nerds will say we're not progressive
But they don't realize this album is a highly focused weapon
Cause we'll get the props and my rep will grow bigger
My name everywhere will make these hoes bitter
And any and all attempts to stop my movement
I swear to God you'll have brain damage from head contusions

[Verse 3]
So my challenge to jealous rappers and wanna-bes:
Make a record better than Ninety Now then you can talk to me
And you can talk to Buck but he ain't working with you
Cause he made an album with me stating facts that mostly dissed you
When flipping the flim flam, call yourself a big fan
But never spend a dime on the music, you'se a bitch man
So if I gotta sell crack to get rich
Well, I'm cooking up the fish scale and rock it like it's Ishmael
Either that or get my stage so mad amped up
Busting black hammers with choreographed dancers
I am the answer to every whack rappers demo song
Cause I am the fresh maker like the fucking Mentos song
October 26th a renaissance begins to work
Doin' shit so big I take one step and fall off of the Earth
We on a motherfucking murder spree
Give constructive criticism and I'll give you reconstructive surgery

[Interlude]
Yo, Buck, we gotta give 'em one more man
Throw your L's up for this one
Rest in peace Big L, yeah

[Verse 4]
Yo, listen, it don't take fear to fear us
You fuckin' with an evil spirit that don't appear in mirrors
You wouldn't want to be a fly on the wall, I'm grabbing a swatter
Swing it harder than the kick back to a Magnum Revolver
Yes I'm just awful, a God not a phony
Menage with your wife and I bought your daughter a pony
Officers know me as "That's that motherfucking guy"
Shoot a pec or a thigh, don't mean shit if you a muscle guy
My guns are more than a friend
On time at your door with a nine and a .45 at a quarter 'till ten
I seal Navy Seals, seen a whole army's intestines
And choked enemy soldiers till they had Barney's complexion
One harmless suggestion is get your speech right
My scrap napkin verses smoke what you took a week to write
You like butt cheeks tight, it ain't hard to tell
You been through more manholes than Donatello and Raphael

FaggotUh, uh
What (mothafucker)
The fuck y'll want
D.I.T.C
Nigga what
Shh
Y'll niggas is creeps
Straight up
Yo'll, laying in the cut type nigga
What!

[O.C.]
Strangers I don't trust
Peep out the scenery so I can adjust (coo)
Once was a foo
'Til I learned the rules, the hard way
Peace by jukes, I was shook
Got slept, nowadays I'm keeping it stepped
But it ain't to the point that I'm rocking a vest
I'm in as well, shit, 'til I die
Till then I'm staying fly
On the reg staying out of the red
Blood, sweat with no tears
Fuck having fears
Two thou's dead on, i'm meeting it dead on
Millennium, many dumb to the fact
You clap that Mush shit I'm a bust right back
For realer, live nigga, see it in my eyes
If ya, test my strength I'm a give you a surprise nigga
Some what the quiet type
I'm not the cat in the party that will start the fight

Chorus: repeat 2X

It's just champagne thoughts (thoughts)
Man made to floss (word)
Vanity or lust (lust)
Greed makes more
Lets stick up the bank and make off with it all (all)
Pick up and start where the others left off

[O.C.]
Doing what I gotta do at any cause
Knowing life is short
Give or take a few blows with knots to show
Sometimes you make friends especially when
The ends play a part out of nowhere
Skins at the bar
Sucking up
Champagne is just like shit
Attract wanna be wives, nothing but flies
Anybody applies when you stink like dough
Many take a sniff when they walk past O
Or walk past 'Ness to L, Diamond or Buck
A.G and Show, that nigga Fat Joe
The ones giving head figure it count for dead
Prez pays offs, deep throat my crew you gon' stay whores
Goin' in spots like swat, my entourage stepping through free of charge
Everybody watch bouncers clout the VIP
A space reserved for the whole D.I.T.C

Chorus 2X

Yo'll Yo'll  (over last 2 lines of chorus)

[O.C.]
I got G's on mind Cream to blow at times
Weed smoke once in a blue, it's something to do
Whip around one deep in my LS4
Shorty nose open wide like she sniffin' it raw
Got a low crossed out, buckwilin' is a no, no
Rap name O.C, Mush Shine be my M.O
Just to find the means in the end
When it's all set it s done, with a crib and keys to a Benz
Twin 9 Berettas serial scrape the letters
Wherea keep 'em tucked inside the wine leather
Cyanide thoughts make shots ring off
Sabotage with a snitch who decided to talk
Greedy niggas get snatched by the Rico laws
Then the murder one stuck, when it rain it pours
Young cats with cigars inside our jaws
Young black entrepreneurs read about us in Forbes

Chorus 3X (with ad-libs)

D.I.T.C, niggaIntro/Chorus:

C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down (4X)

Verse One: El Da Sensai

C'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
Where kids get wreck and, the beat's bound to pound
We're strollin through the industry B, see we gotta be
The next shit that kicks, cause brothers ain't got it
In this rap shit, ain't no time for the dilly-dally
Pally throw a match in the Gasoline Alley
Blew up mad spots, kids were jealous for the props
See the shit never stops Hobbes, just lookin for my dillz-knot
Styles we make, never fake, broke breaks in every crate
Old freestyles and dirty ass copied-over tapes
Notified that, the Artifacts never slack
While crews is on stage wack, we just play the back
Now, the flip tripper ripper slits ya wit da mixture
All crews, who never paid dues, watch it 'fore I get ya
Cause nowadays, it's da ways, of the underground
But they're wack now, so c'mon wit da git down

Chorus

Verse Two: Tame One

You know the stacks, if not, then ask some niggas who heard of me
The half on the Artifacts of Jersey
Cause brothers be buggin not givin love to the nuccas
Sayin fuck us, cause we be shinin brighter than the suckers
Shootin me prison nobody listens to your dissin
Cause yo my shit's legit and as a lyricist I'm hittin
The high note, so why don't, I smile when I take pictures
Cause now that I rock I got more niggas on my jock than bitches
I just wanna do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
But biters and backstabbin rappers don't even like us
But props due, peep The Source RapPages and the Billboard
And read about the tours while you be flappin your jaws
I freak techniques, cause talk is cheaper than beepers from Broad Street
Punks pop junk, Tame and Da Sensai leave em all beat
So peep how deep my technique freaks and how my shit sounds
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

Chorus

Verse Three: MC El, Tame One

Hold up, you rap sucker duck, buck, the track's rough enough
To prove a point, that the niggas is the joint
Magazines where we're seen, now pop the tape in your deck
I got the Heavy Ammunition cuz I'm Flexi Wit Da Tech
Niggas, can't believe the Artifacts acheive
Got, tricks up my sleeve so bow down on your knees
Yo, we ain't got the same lame, ordinary plain game
Put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
So bring submission to the rap recognition
My right hand is itchin from the shit that I'm scriptin
So pass the baton, to the next runner up, Tame
I give a pound so, c'mon wit da git down

Aiyyo, word to my grandma's tampons, I drop bombs, but since
Our demo tracks had gaps some said my fat raps was half-assed
Watchin others rock and clock we shocked em like a robot
With our props, so now the Notty Head Niggas got more knots yo
My pockets are lumpy chump, my drunk style is trunky dunk
My disc in crisp, put funk in funk like Humpty Hump
Cuz I'm comin from the underground I'm down wit da git down
MC's who used to diss us, get pissed cause they ain't shit now
The Artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
The days of gettin slept on, are dead because we keep on
Peepin these weak MC's, who cheese with their bologny
Cause they're phony as fuck, and couldn't pull shit off a tow truck
So yo bro, now you know my flow so go and sit down
Or c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

Chorus 2X[Verse 1: Papoose]
I was born in a human body, I‚Äôm deadly and dangerous
The way I decrease life quality is outrageous
But you don‚Äôt gotta worry, I‚Äôm not contagious
I‚Äôm genetic, I travel through your family for ages
I could live in yo daughter, I could live in yo son
If you smoke cigarettes, I could live in yo lungs
I can develop in yo stomach and be that small
But I grow to the size of a basketball
Now you can ignore me and try to pass it on
You‚Äôll be a statistic, in the casket gone
I could be a sharp pain that you feel in yo spine
I can be a brain tumor on the back of yo mind
I‚Äôll even be in yo food if you eatin that swine
Don‚Äôt go to the doctor so you never catch me in time
I done cause some strong men to lose they strength
Even cause some pretty women to lose they breasts
Only God know the cure and to whom he bless
Is the chosen, he choose the best
I‚Äôm a physical enemy, here to bring miserable treachery
I can affect him, her, they, you or them and me
But one small woman gotta checkup randomly
They burn me out of her body with chemotherapy
If you come late I‚Äôll deflate your energy
Take all of your hair and erase your memory
I can shorten your life if you livin it long
Even took a black queen named Vivian Strong
If you don‚Äôt go to the doctor that mean you support me
The only way to stop me is to catch me early
And gangstas who think I can‚Äôt get in y'all body
I even claimed the life of mobster John Gotti
Have you had a checkup? If no is your answer
Then let me introduce myself, my name is cancer

[Hook x2: Erykah Badu]
He rides to it
Don‚Äôt stress a lot
Put protection on
If he‚Äôs in your home

[Verse 2: Papoose]
The prettiest woman out here blows long in the wind
Even sip when she wasn‚Äôt soft as her skin
Teeth look like ivory, pleasant as a beach
Breasts like 2 watermelons, ripe like a peach
On the outside, sexy as can be
But on the inside she‚Äôs infected with me
She be up in every neighborhood, dead on the street
Give you her phone number, give you head in the V
And she don‚Äôt like condom, she sex it for free
So if you ever met er get tested for me
Every single day I add names to my dying list
My epidemic is strong as an iron fist
You should check your body fluids, that‚Äôs where I exist
Can travel through saliva, I hope you like to kiss
You can‚Äôt get rid of me, you can cry and wish
It‚Äôs no denying this, science says
He says I was born in Africa, but he‚Äôs a lying bitch
I was born in the laboratory, my father‚Äôs a scientist
You can‚Äôt contact me if you walk in a bathroom
Or if you talk to your classmate in your classroom
You never see me coming, I‚Äôm smooth as a jazz tune
Not airborne, I pass moves
But you should make sure they clean the needle when you getting them tattoos
I‚Äôm the reason the word positive means bad news
Idiotic if you don‚Äôt believe in me
Even took a great rapper named Eazy-E
If you have a lot of sex you should have some condoms
Cause you could live with me, ask Magic Johnson
I enter your body with only one assumed mission
That‚Äôs only to break down your immune system
Become sick easy cuz you not immune
And I can pass over through every open wound
So make sure you put a Band-Aid on your cut
Before you shake another man‚Äôs hands sayin wussup
I‚Äôm physical and visible, you can‚Äôt feel me
Medicine, I‚Äôm invincible, you can‚Äôt kill me
AIDS is my name, don‚Äôt get it wrong
It stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)

[Hook x2: Erykah Badu]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
This drug addict named Raj is infected with my evil
Got some new dope he wanna try with his people
He said go ahead and try it, it‚Äôs some brand new diesel
That‚Äôs when I found myself travelling through a needle
Don‚Äôt even know what he getting into is a shame
Tied his arm up and pump me right in his vein
He had a lot of women, was living to play his life
But he was married, he took me home to his wife
Now she‚Äôs a carrier who carries on with me
His wife had a baby, the baby was born with me
And I hope that you wouldn‚Äôt take this song silly
A lot of people infected, it‚Äôs a strong pity
You got a jimmy hat? Then you should put on jimmy
Let‚Äôs protect ourselves, we should all, really
I‚Äôm tryna live long, won‚Äôt you live long with me?
Suburbs to the city, sing this song with me

[Hook x3: Erykah Badu]Intro:
It's the number one crew in the area

[Verse 1: Big L]
The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense
Gettin' men lynched, too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all ya new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still gel me without a motherfuckin' LP

[Hook]
It's the number one crew in the area
"Known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard"

[Verse 3: Microphone Nut]
Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
I'm giving these ladies something they can feel cause I'm real
Ya man get outta line and it's kill kill kill

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Party Arty of Ghetto Dwellaz]
Yo you step up and you'll get played like the small fry
I'm throwin' niggas off the roof said you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around you'll be a dead man
I get hype tonight's the night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal, eatin' people
Not Jeffery Dahmer I'm the sequel, head or gut like Illegal
So what cha want?
Yo I'm strapped with the gats step up plap plap
I'm leavin' caps in your back fool
I rip tracks wanna say peace to hip hop
A nigga disagree bring it on and get dropped
I get wreck I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the Tec smokin' niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how I'm gettin' jewels
I say big up big up it's a stick up stick up
I stick and move

[Big L:]
And that's how we do. So I.U. grab the gat and let loose

[Verse 6 Grand Daddy I.U.]
Yo rat tat tat I got the gat cocked
Nigga we ghost man a punk?
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
I'm shootin' up like the west is
Fuck suggestions
I'll blow out a niggas intestines
Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
Cause you're marked for death[Intro: Malcolm X]
"Stealing runs rampant in Harlem
Gambling runs rampant in Harlem
All types of evils and uhh, vices that tear apart our community
Run rampant in Harlem"

[Verse 1: Big L]
The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin poems to have them faggots diggin hoes like Reverand Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps til they head splits, then break em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin Tecs, because I be stayin vexed
Some nigga named Dex, was in the projects layin threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin
I'm chokin enemies til they start turnin pale
Satan said I'm learnin well, Big L's gonna burn in hell
Front and get scarred cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a thievin' squad, and none of us believe in God

[Hook: McGruff/ Big L]
(McGruff:) Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
(Big L:) Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

[Verse 2: Big L]
I got styles you can't copy bitch, it's the triple six
In the mix, straight from H-E-double-hockey sticks
Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up, they said a real man
Won't hit a girl well I ain't real cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price, I'm the type
To snap in heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, cause hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit, strictly, little kids
Be wakin up cryin, yellin, "Mommy Big L is comin to get me!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big L]
I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be runnin up
"Can I get your autograph L?" No bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge; just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread pretzelhead
'fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

[Hook][Hook]
Don't trust anyone
(Ain't no one we can trust)

[Verse 1]
I wanna take it from star's and scrapes by high bars and gates
To stars and papes, hungry niggas that starve relate
Money-getters sniffing yards of yay
Honey-hitters getting charged all day
R.I.P. to B.I.G and Marvin Gaye, cause life's beyond critical
So I can't be seen wich means I'm non-visible
Son your aim with a firearm's pitiful, you hit the wrong man
And left his moms miserable, criminals using this moment to show
What we distributing is potent
My ludicrous slogans be having shortie's uterus open
I keep my pay collected and stay connected to get niggas
To play my record and my name respected is the main objective
I'm leaving foes crushed with no points on a doughnut
I'm so nuts niggas that play heroes I give em cold cuts
Adolescents packing Wessons with solid crack professions
He die from the mack's agression instead a black depression

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Well if you thinking what I said was soft, once the lead bust off
I'll have you running like a chicken with his head cut off
You're number one opponent, make sure them guns is loaded
Before you find your sons extorted and unsupported
If I'm not firing, I'm getting higher than
Mothafuckas is better off retiring and playing violins
Or idling, you're admiring my style cause it's quite vicious
Smack bitches like niggas smack niggas like bitches
Doing time for crime they facing, now your mind is wasted
For tryna shine with diamond bracelets
Mad flavour, the bag lacer, take a pull of this
Shit have you feeling like a dragracer
Notice me, you ain't supposed to be attacking
It global and locally I mastered it, lyrics is vocally immaculate
Niggas is totally inaccurate, packing iron for wreck
A lotta these brothers is dying bets
But son, imagine having lions for pets
Smoking cess, fucking any bitch you try to sex
I'm thinking long term, more than just bying a Lex
I want the livest connect with each man in my fam high as the next

[Hook][Sample]

[Verse One]
[Celph Titled:]
The sound of my voice'll make stab wounds
Barber of the universe leavin' planets with half moons
I have assumed that those who choose to make rap music
Have no talent at music, so me and Vinnie came to grab ya head and put a gat to it
[Vinnie Paz:]
I bring the .45 Glock and the .38
AR-15 send their body to the pearly gates
Me and Celph ain't makin' happy music, this is purely hate
Tobe Hooper in this muthafucka cousin, saw his face
[Celph Titled:]
And when we holdin' the Tec, we'll put a hole in ya neck
Leavin' you with a permanent T-Pain vocal effect
I ain't a flossy dude, sippin' Mo'
But if I was, I'd pop the cork off in your bitch's asshole (Let 'em know)
[Vinnie Paz:]
That's how the ho get treated, she get the smut treatment
Toss her out the whip, leave her on the rough cement
Celph and Vinnie will deliver an abrupt beatin'
And the Walther 9M will leave your guts leakin'
[Celph Titled:]
Your video had the best special effects I seen
Had you in the projects usin' computer blue screens (Nah mean?)
[Vinnie Paz:]
You phony muthafuckas never held a ratchet ever
You was in the faggot bar with Kanye strapped in leather

[Sample-Triggered Hook]
"Boom-kacka-boom-boom, boom-kacka-boom-boom"
"Pow-pow, buck-buck, pow-buck"
"Bang-bang-bang just like the Ricochet Rabbit"
"For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up"
"Boom-kacka-boom-boom, boom-kacka-boom-boom"
"Pow-pow, buck-buck, pow-buck"

"You can suck my dick you little fuckin' bitch or blucka-blucka-blaow!"

[Verse Two]
[Celph Titled:]
I never thought I'd get a bitch pregnant ever
Until my main squeeze gave birth to a baby Beretta
(The more gravy the better), don't holla just yell
It's like the night before Christmas, I can't wait to see hell
[Vinnie Paz:]
I can't wait to see hell either
I'mma run up on the first muthafucka that I see with a rusty cleaver
I ain't a sucker neither, and no one fuck with Vinnie
Fat gut, wife-beater, pasta, I'm a fuckin' Guinea
[Celph Titled:]
I'll smash a mirror, I'll walk under a ladder
I'll let a black cat cross my path, it don't matter
Cause I ain't superstitious and I don't fear nothin'
You talkin' all that tough shit
[Vinnie Paz:]
But you's a queer frontin'
And y'all are snitch but let me tell you somethin', you ain't hear nothin'
I like to refer to my trigger as the fear button
I don't fear nothing either, I just cock the pistol
I like the way the bullet burst and what it do to tissue

[Sample-Triggered Hook]
"Boom-kacka-boom-boom, boom-kacka-boom-boom"
"Pow-pow, buck-buck, pow-buck"
"Bang-bang-bang just like the Ricochet Rabbit"
"For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up"
"Boom-kacka-boom-boom, boom-kacka-boom-boom"
"Pow-pow, buck-buck, pow-buck"
"Yo I'm strapped with the gat, step up, blat-blat!"
"You can suck my dick you little fuckin' bitch or blucka-blucka-blaow!"

[Verse Three]
[Vinnie Paz:]
Ayo we blazin' son
[Celph Titled:]
Like gang bangers with laser guns
My rap verses are curses and scriptures spit with a razor tongue
Nitwit, I play ancient drums
That conjure up demon spirits that appear in smoke out of a pagan's lungs
I'm everything hardcore, complex, original
Ya no want test the disciple of death
C. Titled is fresh like salmon at Red Lobster
And C. Titled's the best at blammin' hammers at imposters
Get ya ass whooped with automatic hazard causers
You can't make tables turn, you got bad revolvers
Faulty guns that go "click!" when you pull the trigger
Mines go "brriddtk brriddtk", it's sick when I pull the trigger
[Vinnie Paz:]
It don't matter how we get down, guns or rhymes
I'm white and raw like the perico chico, tons of dimes
I got a way with wild shit cousin, tons of crimes
Tons of .45's, AK's, tons of nines[Hook]
Every record label sucks dick [x4]
Every record label (every record label)
They suck dick! (suck dick!)

[Verse 1]
Fuck the new clothes, sport shitty jeans, fuck the limousines
When the ho schemes you end up with no beans
There's only 50,000 heads that are true to this
The rest are clueless to what real hip hop music is
Plus the labels think that artists are pathetic, I don't sweat it
If they take the credit I will send them to the medic
The industry will gas your head up, you ain't shit to them, don't get fed up
Cause when you're down and out they won't help you get up
They sit around creating gimmicks, sky's the limit, but to him it's
Nothing, A&R men act like schizophrenics
Fuck the negative reviews, I sing the blues
Cause if I blow up I still lose

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now how can the musicians be the scholars
When they're making less than four percent of six dollars?
Most of the kids that kick a rap just don't deserve opinions, acting like critics
Looking like Richard Simmons, now they're sporting Timberlands
And I ain't trying to be accepted, but it's hectic
When you try to sell you records and your record label don't respect it
Now all these promotional stunts gets me emotional
Not hospitable, I'll never recoup so it's not profitable
And I can end up as white trash living in a trailer park
Eating tuna fish with my Cheez Whiz
"So how you'd get your job in the black music department?"
Since I was growing up that's where my heart went
I won't be going out like Kurt Cobain, or Tattoo
"Da plane, da plane!" jibba jibba jib, Jane!
So if my sales don't exceed the expectations
My relation-ships will be Uzi clips and decapitations
Cause the fact is, technically, I need a vasectomy
No pregnancy, kids got the tendency to be sweating me
So do your own! Them scumbags is making moneybags
In the meantime, your Karl Kanis turn to rags
Cause labels don't know shitty rappers from any rappers
So listen rappers, they only know how to pinch a penny, rappers
I end up bankrupt and penniless, while you remain the rich man
My fist is up your ass to rip your lips off
This ain't the rock and roll era, so how could you know what's worse or better?
Chilling in your polyester sweater
A big advancement doesn't make the move the wisest
Cause Def Jam offered me more loot than Jive did

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And the executives at labels, they about equal to McDonald's workers
They all down to jerk us, trying to keep us poor on purpose
They expect that respect that they don't give, so don't think that it's negative
If you don't want to let a record executive live
Now pretty bitches wind up giving up they butts
But I'm used to busting nuts in stank perverted sluts
Just the thought of getting signed, you masturbated
Can't you see the industry is gold-plated?
"He sounds like Ice Cube, let's sign him!
He sounds like Onyx, let's sign him!
He sounds like that shit that's hitting, let's sign him!"
God forbid I get HIV
I'd be biting people and spitting blood at the entire music industry

[Hook]Uhh, yeah, phenomenon, yeah
[Yvette] Ooooh, yeah, baby far from yours, ohh yeah

Verse One: O.C

Yo, time is most limited I'm back on the scene
O replenishes, potency like four or five Guinnesses
Hennessey's flourishing, O.C.is nourishing
Performin miracles, ill and mad lyrical
What stands before your very eyes is a
One man stand-alone phenomenon
Microphone misery you sufferin, taste my repetoire
In your face like a buck fifty, done with the razor
I'm felt by Aztecs, felt by Asians
Portuguese Lebanese and even Caucasians
Every form of power, they respect my stats
Slap me five, with former leader drink Cognac with diplomat
Retard your whole brigade, cave in your brain waves
(With subliminal messages) makin party people slaves
Ya hit reverse to rewind, and defy my cause
"One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours"

Chorus One: Yvette Michelle

He's no average M.C., with a smile on his face
Though they'll try to bite his style, no one can duplicate

Verse Two: O.C

I be the chosen one, beyond the Moet and Cristal
A son of King and a Queen, therefore ability
For song run in my genetics
I gave ideas to L. Ron Hubbard to write books on Dianetics
FedEx your info, if you wanna show the manager
Mr. Dave make sure give us a good payday too
I was assigned to Earth, on a mission
To spread worldwide my glorious compositions
Notes are like B sharps floatin
Out of my mouth from start to finish til the song diminish
My lyrical energy bring out envy in most MC's
Who listen to O, he didn't know me before
Then you know who I are now, bitin my style
That's a crime to be dealth with but we take it to trial
Verdict is in, the judge know my beef has cause
"One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours"

Chorus Two: Yvette Michelle

He's no average MC, with a smile on his face
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate
He can flow anywhere ya want, he can rhyme any time you say
And he's never ever ever too far, from tomorrow, today

Verse Three: O.C

You may never find a MC well orchestrated like a symphony
Some'll go down in history, some in infamy
The infamy will be somewhat a mystery
As long as my name O.C. live on through infinity
My identity, will ring bells in all facilities
From fans to enemies I'm the antidote and remedy
I'mma philosophize, analyze, no question
If I die I'mma return like Jesus' resurrection
I'm a blessin to the rap game, my claim to fame is when
I dissapear reappear, I put rappers to shame
Plain and simple, in common English, what I distinguish
The meanest lyric flamethrower your career's over
Finesse a mic Casanova, Don Juan or MC
The people need a change, this rap shit is deranged
Yo Raider, flip the fader, let em know my cause
"One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours"

Chorus Two (Roc Raider cuts and scratches the "one thing" sample)
Chorus Two repeats

[Yvette] Never too far, never...
