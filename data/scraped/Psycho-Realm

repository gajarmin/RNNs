[Intro: Mr Duke]
This jam right here is dedicated
To all you motherfucker that ain't right here
You're supposed to be right here with me, motherfucker
You know what I'm saying ?
You know what the fuck I'm saying
I'll catch up with you soon, homies
Ah ah, yeah, we'll catch up to you all
All of you motherfucker
And you know what I'm saying
Cause at the end, at the end we all diiiie

[Jacken]
Sounds like Gods are crying tears of Malathion
Raining over your head to put out the fire
Who desires to die? besides, the suicidal tendencies
Can lead to the eternal sleep
So keep you eyes wide open and alive
Grab your snake and ride to the other side
If your intention is to defy death
I'll tell you now, even the best get laid to rest
We're on our way to the stone garden
End of the road were everybody goes but not forgotten
Frames all rotten souls travel to unravel
Other worlds and big cloud castles
Why do we have these hassles, livin' cautious
Walking the street watching your back?
Your fear's collosus
We conquer souls while ganja rolls
Everybody here's high so the story unfolds
We're on another planet thought, thinking immortal
But the path we're on leads us straight to the portal

[Hook: Jacken & (Mr Duke)]
(Devil's in disguise)
They're coming to claim us
Let it come as no surprise
I stare into the face of death
Cause at the end of their time, everybody dies

[Mr Duke]
This is a time of pain
Warzone for your own gain
I roam the middle with the metal cause I'm insane
Break frames... catch a smoking
Is it gonna earn you a name?
Did you get slain?
Or fall victim to bald knuckle-heads and bad aim
It ends all the same
Every mothafucker right here gotta jump on soul train
Some go up, some go south
Some get stuck in a realm with no way out
Some get to hide, O.D. on drug hits
Dying in your sleep, that's the shit
But lives get took violently
On the streets of a lost city

[Hook: Jacken & (Mr Duke) x4]

[B-Real]
In the stone garden, we keep all the heavenly gates packed
With fresh souls under control, no holdin' back
Look at all these names engraved in the stones
Even the unknown finds his path on his way home
Roam... where the spirits all lie
One of these fuckin' days, even I'm gonna die
And when I do, I'll be another memory
Hanging out with the ones who were there before me
Look out haaa... let me set your soul free
By the Buddha tree, open the gates to eternity
Everybody rise up, open up your eyes
We demise and we're trippin' to the other side

[Hook: Jacken & (Mr Duke) x2]

[Mr Duke speaking]
Yeah at the end, at the end
We'll catch up with you
You know what I'm saying, that's it
We all die then motherfucker
Yeah even if you take me out by now
One of my motherfucker's gonna take you up
And then you'll take him and back and forth and shit
And it don't stop you know what I'm saying
Body rott drop and shit
You know what I mean
Ah ah

This is the endI always wondered what death would be like
Especially when duke died and came back
And said he didn't see light
Was that a glimpse into eternal sleep? no afterlife?
Or promise of hell? the mystery as dark as the night
All signs told me my days were numbered walking the earth
And I'd go out just as bloody as I did on my birth
My mother in pain she's still alive feeling the hurt
But my agony died with me when the weaponry burst
Was it my destiny to lead a caravan in a hearse?
I always thought I'd lead revolutionary victory first
But my enemy caught me slipping and dealt me the curse
Now all my mind could think about is this verse

(chorus)
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I can't sleep like I'm battling meth
The reaper creeps while I'm gasping for breath
I ask the lord to forgive me for debt
When death comes and my soul leaves my body to rest

No angels on my arrival and no light either
This might be the end of the road where life leaves you
Athiest prophecy looking likely firm non-believers
Faith is their robbery loot
Religion cashing out on the dreamers
In the corner of this room I'm looking at my body
It's lifeless from a trife death with holes from a shotty
Most of my limbs rotting, cold? yeah probably
I'm tripping cause I'm in the middle of the spiritual
And physical parting
I wonder if this land of shadows is my purgatory
And wonder why if I was semi-righteous
Did my end have murder for me
When I was young, man, I heard this story
If you don't reach your mission in life
You get a second chance for glory
Is there revival for a common man?
Is that survival for the godly plan?
The bible blueprints the last stand
God and devil armageddon - blast gangs
I reincarnate reborn with a gasmask

(bridge)
I don't think I'm alive I know I died
Didn't survive the enemy gun fire
This ain't hell it's far from heaven
All I remember we was fighting
In the war of armageddon... now I'm
Stuck in a spiritual realm I don't think I'm going to
Either heaven or hell I'm being sent back so we
Can help and get it right this last time
We won't fail

(chorus)"Don't be a good neighbour to her
I'll send a love letter
Straight from my heart, fucker!
You know what a love letter is
It's a bullet from a fuckin' gun, fucker!
You receive a love letter from me
And you're fucked for ever"

[All]
L to the O to the V to the E, love!

[B-Real]
Is the word that I'm thinking of
Sometimes I sit back and try to figure it out
How it can break the strongest man down
To his very last compound
I took a fall cause I went out for the love
That I shared with a woman who didn't care
I tried to give her my all and change my shit up
But she didn't give a fuck about that when she decided to get up
Fuck all the good time, just remember the bad
Fuck me and fuck all the love we used to have
Chillin' at the clubs, your friends and my friends
Hangin' out all night, driving around in the Benz
Fuckin' off all my ends but I can't pretend
Not fell the pain inside, suicide crossed my mind
Every time I heard your name
But I got strong and realized it's all about the game
Now you're all just the same

Chorus: [All]
L to the O to the V to the E, love!
L to the O to the V to the E
L to the O to the V to the E, love!
L to the O to the V to the E

[Duke]
Fuck love, I just can't get enough of your freaky ass baby
Sexy mothafucka, when you walk by and I wanna go for a ride
You hit like drugs, or red wine I'm blind
Drivin' through your world sky high
Flyin' through your town like wind sex triangle
Circles of sin begin, spinnin' I'm happy grinnin'
Sufferin' over pussy I'm fuckin'
He's stuck like a truck and I'm like you
Scandalous slut what's up
Where's your man probably with the puta that says she loves me
My heart grows cold and hard as stone
Time goes by and the last laugh is mine

Chorus[Hook: Duke]
What type of drugs do you do?
And what do you do to get your hands on your shit mothafucka huh??!!
What kind of dirty tricks you do to get yourself fixed?
You're all sick; is it lack of love? or lack of your withdrawal?
Drugs!! I need femine venoms in the system
In order to function in the rhythm

[Duke]
You get hooked to the look of wild vomen
And wanna live in the land of the unforgiven
Habits turn bad once
Individuals make 'em poison rituals
Gotta have it a have it, a habit
Welcome your choices of an addict

[B-Real]
God forgive me for my bad habits
Drug addict needle in my vein, I gotta have it
To kill the pain, you silly rabbit
I dig a hole under the sun to hide from the static
Automatic pressure got to kill it
Give some act-rite juice so I could feel it
Ah, everything is all right
The eye of the needle cries out to the dark side
Looking inside through the outdoor knocking
But society won't let me in so I grab my stocking
Put over my head and get the dough
Cause the needle is my God and smack is my soul

[Sick Jacken]
Paraphernalia in my domain brings conclusion
That I'm using but the question is, am I abusing
Infested in the residence of Pico Union
Drug intrusion, color fusion
Invasion! of your senses maintain relapse
Dilate eye lenses, my dependence on these chemical artifical dreams
Is what makes my habit obscene

[Hook]

[Sick Jacken]
Tinted like the darkest shadows, my mind is cloudy
Subliminal commands will penetrate then I get rowdy
Conditions drowsy, the sedative brings negative energy
I slump down and stay ahead of me
Powerful like metamphetamines my state is altered
This here's no lie hydroponic, chronic
Got you feeling all erotic aphrodisiac, who's got it?
Alvarado maniacs risk prison time buying dimes
When you got the fix get in the mix
There's no denying drug's the only factor
Got me in the rapture making an addict out of you
And proceed to capture your mind

[Duke]
You're mine, choke hold to your whole skull, substance uncontrolled
Who holds straight keys to locks and unlocks key holes
The structure of my trip is unstoppable
I'm 50 hits of the dot all powerful
We go deranged and remain living the last days in the haze of purple micro

[B-Real]
I remember when I was a high school star
Had the prom queen, scholarship, brand new car
It's funny, you never know who your friends are
'til you lose all your sensibilities to the dark
Wanna act right but I'm all wrong; no wonder my family
Don't wanna have nothing to do with me
Humiliation, neglect, no respect
The concept of rehabilitation has been swept
I wish I was clean, a far fetched dream
But what other way am I going to blow off my steam

[All Together]
Heaven's all in this bottle of juice

[B-Real]
Making me feel high

[Sick Jacken]
Making me feel loose

[Duke]
Got nowhere turn to
No one trusts me, I don't even trust myself[Mr. Duke]
Run around downtown, cliques throw down in the mix
Clowns and infinite showdowns
Battle grounds all break downs; world's upside down
Making wicked smiles wicked frowns, we get down
With our own gangster sound
Static kingdoms break you and your manhood shallow
With shanks of venom metal
Rattle fuckin' snakes I'm as high as the stakes
Quarter ounce of weed to the head no breaks home wait
Street wars we get in them
Furious fist on my wrist is gonna get them and you

[Sick Jacken]
Out of frictions comes static causing mad panic
On the streets, the dramatic battles increase
We see more wars, less peace, we're even fighting police
Resulting, they're biggest enemies
Lifestyles of the criminal be wild
You wanna see more action, hold up wait a while
Fist crash giants clash
Putting on the face of the devil mask doing brain bash

[Hook: Mr. Duke]
Look out for the showdown
Crazy in the head locos 'bout to throw down
Look out for the showdown
Crazy in the head locos 'bout to throw down

[B-Real]
Watch out, look out, look out, watch out
For the showdown, you better slow down
Give me fifty feet or better
Keep your eye on the barrel of the beretta
The lead comin' to wet'cha
Spread your body parts all over the continent
I'm a dominant mothafucka, but you're the opposite
Turn around put your hands on the side
Are you aligned by the sunshine on your gun
The outcome: you're just another one soul
Flyin' into the heavens hit by the '57
Ass end scrapping, illuminating the whole block
They all flock in anticipation
You're getting rolled by the dayton
Now I see your hand shaking
You want our of this situation

[Hook]

[Sick Jacken]
Images of war weapons the psycho presence
Blood wettens, stains the curb where you're steppin'
Deadly ground's the home of all showdowns
Come into my kingdom , sirens rattle eardrums
It ain't one on one no more, it' gun on gun
Bullets take the place of fists so what's the outcome
Crazy wars, severe scars
If you're just like me, you're defending what's yours
Taking no loss

[Mr. Duke]
We're heavy duty like tanks
This is my two chrome shanks
Criminal styles point blank
You think my music is crazy like Tony Montana
Fumando marijuana con Santana tomorrow
I might not be alive, so I wanna bring all the enemy's sorrow
I rock the block with the music maniac
Tar back locos seekin' that warpath
Why don't punks be legit, they ell bring havoc in their head
A psycho one will shoot them dead
That's the fundamental to a fucked up mental
Now you got a gun, your life's a psycho realm
My strategy assault battery
Runnin' through your neighborhood in cliques of three
Smokin' in the battlegrounds on wild streets
And wild showdowns, enemy take a look around

[Hook][Hook: Sick Jacken]
Fiend when the leno gets put to the flame
Caps and 'shrooms stems to alter my brain
Drop a few tabs to make me insane
Then lose myself in a realm of strange days
My pusher helps me reach a sick domain
Sober's out of range, it's over, I've changed
Lose yourself and your name in a pile of cocaine
Slave to the drug that slugs all my pain
Pow Wow... [Echoes]
Pow Wow... [Echoes]

[Sick Jacken]
Smoke crawls through the tube of the mask, I take a blast
Faceless figure, you can't see through the clouded glass
Consuming herb gas, let loose the straps and pass
Like inked clowns we laugh
Through ancient indian rites we pow wow at night
With bow wows take full flight
Let the peace pipe ignite insight
Spark the light then invite the right zone
Taking you on the ultimate high
Despite the legal status we find ways to have it
Some to create some simply cause they're addicts
Always at it like drug nymphos, burn info
Memory loss because they puff indo

[Sick Duke]
Hear the tone of my vocal chords and get stoned
On the streets I'm a drug zone, homes
Roam in you head in your psyclone
Sicko mindstate full blown
Come load up the ammo
White paper wraps indo and freaks your weed ho
Let the smoke settle
Deep in the mind of a big time fiend and you'll see
Good and bad times
Your real life scene turns into fields of sick dreams
Using anything to get high sicko
Will you come back or remain trapped?

[Hook]
Fiend when the leno gets put to the flame
Caps and 'shrooms stems to alter my brain
Drop a few tabs to make me insane
Then lose myself in a realm of strange days
My pusher helps me reach a sick domain
Sober's out of range, it's over, I've changed
Lose yourself and your name in a pile of cocaine
Slave to the drug that slugs all my pain
Pow Wow.. [Echoes]
Pow Wow.. [Echoes]

Lose yourself and your name in strange days like drug slaves

[Sick Duke]
Indian style, come with us red-eyed
And there will be no lies
I'm seeing visions
In the desert we were all trippin', I'm stuck
Can't see shit just the next drug hit
'Til I'm dead I'll keep my head lit
Overdoses and greedy ass loads
For those that want to walk these roads
Let the drug settle

[Sick Jacken]
I see in three dimensions no question
Cause I D.A.R.E.D. to overcome drug prevention
Tried to avoid it but I guess I was destined
For mind expansion, the kind to write text in
'Til in peace I'm resting forever getting high
'Til I get the ultimate high in heaven
But 'til then I keep myself bound to the limit
Won't O.D. unless I predict it in lyrics
And when you hear it I've overcome death and don't fear it
I'm one who never smokes simply for gimmick
I speak it, I live it, blaze to enhance my spirit
Calm my nerves so I don't go out and smack critics
We're inked outcasts who inhale grass to get a grasp
Life's a hard task for low class
So we maintain by numbing our brain with pain killers
Some snort dust and others use vein fillers
My crew smokes chronic pillars used to chill us
As long as there's addicts the president remains the biggest dealer

[Sick Duke]
Who's your pusher, baby?
Sick dogs pushing these drugs and dicks in your guts
You get fucked
Drunk sluts act scandalous
Minds get lost and your bodies feel lust
We stay high
Just don't want to be sober, why try?
You run around in the mix of fiends trying to get re-upped
All kinds of good drugs got you fucked up
So now you just need a fix somehow
Call up your dogs and have your pow wowWe came to drop these styles; It's no shock
We rock 'til the cops come and knock non-stop

We come from Psycho Cities and Blocks
We're raisedby gunshots low life in hip hop

Despite the rules I choose to be one of the chosen few
Leavin you confused, dazed and what got you all amazed
How the fuck we could be so blazed?
It takes one block to fill your life with terror
Think of all your bullet holes embedded in your area
Bullet, bullet and in the end, who gets shot
By motherfuckers making hip hop?
We came here to get you high, represent underdogs world-wide
On the hustle leading crooked lives
We don't die, we multiply; but we divide
So how are we gonna survive?
You got your role, I got mine; dont cross paths
Cause an intersection's just another form of clash, we crash

Due to violent environments, crimes terrorize rhyme events
I'm bringing the streets to the stage, rockin your front page
L.A., street families are crumblin we legacies
There must be some type of way out of this pain
Said the joker chain smokin weed train
Take aim stop random cappin, shoot a hootah captain

Chorus:

We came to drop these styles, it's no shock
We rock 'til the cops come and rock non-stop
Do you rock or do you get locked in fights with Glocks?
The Psycho Realm's spraying out your box
We come from psycho cities and blocks
We're raised by gunshots and low life in hip-hop
Do you rock or do you get locked in fights with Glocks?
We come from psycho cities and blocks

Will spirits dancing in the flesh accept
When somebody changes the music and the tune is death
We don't dance around bonfires
We get stoned, tripped or wired
In memory of those expired
My people's exodus results in prejudice
You ask us why, in poverty, we become terrorists
Now let me tell you this: we don't choose to tote gats
And sellin on the corner is to avoid tax
If you gun talk or hip-hop there's too much division
So find a new mission or it'll stop
We do our thing, talk slang, live on fast lanes
Some do it for money, and others for the fame
You're out playin games dangerous with high aim
How long will you maintain before you get slain?

Clearing the mind but my soul is mad
Tendency to act real bad
Come across me don't c.o.m.e. out at n.i.g.h.t
Yeah, we the fuckin crazy youth from the streets freely
You see me Pelon Psyclone delivering a metal rainstorm

Chorus[Intro]
Let's go!
Space Pyscho Realm shit
I know ya'll hating!

[Hook x2 - Abidiel]
Soy un boxeador de la calle, tira y no falles
Puede ser que mi veneno te desmaye
Lo de vivir en la calle es el detalle para hacerlo como yo
Para hacerlo como yo será mejor que ensayes

[Planetary]
Yo, I called Sick Jacken and told that nigga I'm sick of rapping
He told me to find all the hatahs plan and get the clapping
I'm sick of yapping I told Cynic let's get the mashing
We on the flight to LA squeaking in the ratchets
Security on me like its 9/11, you betta find the Reverend
Call your fam up and try to find a blessing
No time for stressing only maculate versions
You niggas bitching put your tampons back in your purses
Shit, if Psycho betta buck down we matching the wages
We collide wit the unit and put it back in your faces
Nigga, back to the basics, I'm lacing my Chuck Taylors
Who proposed to the game, now I'm getting my tux tailored
I treat every stage like the Garden of Eden
I'm the serpent in the trees that'll stop you from breathing
The vocal, pato loco from Illadel to Acapulco
The local is locked; time to lick a shot to rock the global

[Sick Jacken]
And I read the puto thru my recital it's suicidal
Accu cycle banks so heavy that we ruin idols
And I ain't fucking wit this new arrivals
Man I been leaking off and on since the days of the unit rhinos
You rival the pussy I'm cocky they push me
I'm vynl who said, there ain't no future for minor whino
I wanna leave shit stained in the rap game
So I got a sick as clique wit the wrath of Kane
You know the name Psycho's run it like its nutting mayne
Where the million bald heads looking like fucking gangs
Worldwide symphony killing spree wit a guillotine
The shit is getting sick after clicking up wit the Philly team
My heroin rap keeps stem going back for the trap
I tap a vein, Jacks is the insane brain of the camp
We run shit like when Hussein reigned
It's the art of execution and we shoot you sane

[Hook]

[Duke]
Yeah, you can still catch me out in the streets, blazed up
You know we deep and keep running them up
I try to chill so we put the guns down
But the streets got us by the balls
Shit, it's hard not to gun out
Police keep hunting us down, they after me
Fucking swine, they ain't got nutting to offer me
We pirates in all black, bagged wit big gats
If they want some we can leave 'em rightfully stance
So that's what the fucks up (What's that?)
I keep wilding like I don't travel about the world getting my cocked sucked
I try to cool out, my goons go out, they repping that shit
The SS gun and burn down the house, take ova the place
We here for good, the shit could get scary
Like 2012 we just ain't ready
We all need to learn not sit around ready to die
Fuck that, we gonna replenish the Earth

[Crypt the Warchild]
We spit a venomous verse your head will just burst
From Pekoe to Puerto Rico we protecting our turf
So be easy you're dealing wit Made-men
Who do dirt dolo and lyrically spray gems
Digital mayhem thru the G-5 and monitors
Rhyme writ, hieroglyph you can't follow 'em
Mind spit designed sick, I start marketing
Mic booth set on fire, who let the arson in?
Your man got a froggy feeling you betta talk to 'em
Pipe bomb filled wit glass to leave 'em sparkling
Right psalms build to last watch me inside of them
Vomiting, street crash you faggots modeling
You run way bitch, walk I keep 'em wobbling
That gun play let you talk who keeps you swallowing
Blood mugs filled to the top it don't belong to him
That's why they're raising their arms singing the song wit him

[Hook][Hook: Duke]
What type of drugs do you do?
And what do you do to get your hands on your shit mothafucka huh??!!

[B-Real]
Making me feel high

[Sick Jacken]
Making me feel loose

[Duke]
Got nowhere turn to
No one trusts me, I don't even trust myself[Sick Duke]
Cops are found dead and to no surprise
And get classified wasted no lie
They come and invade the wrong life
And only the strong survive so they die
They rest at a place of violence
And 5-0's get broke like codes of silence
Sirens flood the scene with blood
They come firing
We crooks get thrown big books
And hooked with a life sentence
Hunted mental stress on these LA streets
Permanent like inks on flesh, shit
We blast off the big guns
'Til blankets of death have wrapped everyone
Homeboys and the law abiding
Get stuck full of holes they're dying
Don't let the wild bullet
Conspiracies hit the target
Befriend the whole system
Or you too will be found dead

CHORUS (x1)
The code of the streets means anything goes
Against these wars with street fleets
Wanted by many
These sick-ass cliques ain't touched by any
Law enforcement
The code of the streets

[Sick Jacken]
The masterplan don't include us so they shoot us
Supply weapons, coke, crack and buddha
Keep track of who took the bait through computers
Enslave and regulate the 'hoods through the juras
We're all victims as the plot thickens
Better recognize the big plan clock's ticking
Stricken by the plague no sign of us saved
Satan is the ruler of the modern day
We fight angelic wars where my block attacks yours
Numbed by the drugs that are sold on street stores
Everybody out here walking around in a daze
You can't find your way out the maze through purple haze
And while you're lost you're desensitized with force
Through violence that's televised in spite of the cross
Through news and other media we see homicide
So murder and death are now part of our daily lives
All of a sudden you're gunning blasting's just a game
Join a gang run with them destroy your own plane
For a name, fame and crumbs you're dumb
You're feeding right into the conspiracy the outcome is death

CHORUS (x1)

[Sick Duke]
And anybody else that enforce the law
Gets broke the fuck off
We fight with them
How many men get sent to destroy the violent movement?
Oppose government
The code of the streetsWe dominate but feel the pain from bullets my carnales take
Out of state soldiers join us to form a conglomerate
It's out of hate oppressed revolt from feeling that they gotta take
All the weight so we go to war to find another way
Intercept opposite forces entering our sick vicinity
It's killing me how wars that make no sense last an infinity
It's silly shit how a city gets mentally unfit
But really it gets worse when buildings set the scene for murders script
I know you heard of this crisis and what the price is
High stress amplifies the need for all your vices
But steer clear cause we're here in fear they're
Taking over everything and so we fight the war years
Fierce weapons speak for each side through open forum skies
Some die when bullets pierce the skin exploding inside
We provide a dream for our team look past the war scene
Dethrone the king gain control reign supreme
Aim high for your street regime
Look for unseen enemies hiding in the smoke screen

The town I live in got daily death so we're numb to feeling
Blood spilling got my whole block concealing
If cops come frisking we're felony risking
Catch 22 system either way you fall victim
The stage is set up the script is written so we get wet up
Now think about who dies when we let the lead out
We're killing family tragically
The enemy dividing those fighting against it weakening our infantry
We caught on to your big plan
Separate us into street gangs
Infiltrate the sets put some battles in effect
To distract from your dirty outfit, yeah

We rock the block that you got locked
Caught in a battle with crooked-ass cops
Heat we feel on crazy
Gang infested LA streets
We see the red concrete stains
And street platoons feel pain
Real soon times will change
And you will see the truth that we claim
Aim your sickness this way
In sick games we reign insane
There's only one way to explain
And now you lay to die with broke frames

Enemies of the state take center stage
And watch the rules we violate
Now we recall and fall
For all sins of life and break the law
There's many us dangerous
Plenty of you want war we fight any
We walk the paths all lost
And bring LA P.D holocaust
Anybody gets rocked the truth
First your ass gets rocked and then shot
We see through the plot
City street teams get broke down and then got
Rot in ditches dug
To get filled up with government bitches
We see the police
And train to kill the brain of the all terrain beast
Work done by street families
Make us and the state enemies[Chorus]
Don't talk about crimes that you saw
You don't want to get mixed in the war
Hell, you are crazy
If you think there could ever be peace
With the streets and the police
Forget about the faces you saw
This inflicts the casualties of war
Hell, you are crazy
If you think there could ever be peace
With the streets and the police

[Verse 1: Big Duke]

Wicked smilling, illuminate the stage
Right before the raping ballad
Lyrically an assassin, dashing
When the cops feel they crashing
Shot, kill, play tearial slash
Who am i should blast? L.A. pigs that are rats
Hands in the bag, pull a fat stash from the pocket
And I higher than a NASA rocket
Black and white as you shake to pray
Fuck around and live the next day
Okay, when I'm rolling in the streets of the huero
Window down like a pero
When we're in the dragon belly
Fucking police wanna fade me

[Chorus]

Don't talk about crimes that you saw
You don't want to get mixed in the war
Hell, you are crazy
If you think there could ever be peace
With the streets and the police
Forget about the faces you saw
This inflicts the casualties of war
Hell, you are crazy
If you think there could ever be peace
With the streets and the police

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]

The thrill is gone from childhood
To surviving rough neighborhoods
From shattered innocence to militants
For instance may become deliquents
Caught up in a realm of smoke
Like a stick of burning insence
Smelling the aromas of death and its evident
Your life is in his hands
Your faith in god is irrelevant
If he decides to pull the trigger or to not
If he decides to tank, take your bank
That's the end of life
You best throw this episode
Nothing you can do
Cause every criminal is from the same crew
And the cops dont give a fuck about you either
They look at gang activity
And play-follow the leader
Temptation rules over for drugs and money
Your blood goes colder
Now you are the metal piece holder

[Chorus]

Don't talk about crimes that you saw
You don't want to get mixed in the war
Hell, you are crazy
If you think there could ever be peace
With the streets and the police
Forget about the faces you saw
This inflicts the casualties of war
Hell, you are crazy
If you think there could ever be peace
With the streets and the police(Hook)
I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine

(Jacken)
They say there's goodtimes and badtimes
Well let me talk about the good in the hood
Cause this might be the last time I get to say my piece
I might decease
Cause the bad do to take over sometimes, kapish?
We're from the home of the killer bees
Where nine millis be peeling these caps
Filling these gaps some civillians get taxed
The feelings you catch from killing these rats
Happen sometimes but mostly we just chill and relax
Women we mack
Full time hustlers, money we stack
Six deuce
One broad in the front and four in the back
Two if You're fat
In your own car follow the pack
Got some jack in my lap to hold me back
It's that lust potion
After the bottle they look like a model
Otherwise one of the homies will do me the paro
My crew's motto let's get some naked time baby
If not we'll drop you off and we'll see you tomorrow

(Hook)
I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine

(Jacken)
I'm that rolling stone that roams the streets stoned
Unless you got some money for me leave me alone
It's my life and I live it, too short for a loan
So I can't do it your way, I stick to my own
Block parties, backyard boogies, and mozy wozies
Alcohol, music, hoes, and homies
Girls that hold me and love me
Think the world of me
Beautiful women that don't give a fuck if I'm ugly
I got more time than money, homes
You know the song
If you think that they're getting dough from me
You're dead wrong
Those that play games get clowned my games strong
They get the L.D. then we move'em along
To the next pink the next drink
The next joint gets my eyes chinked
Who gives a fuck what you think
It's in the name of fun that's how my game is run
And I'll be joking and toking till my days are done

(Hook)
I like to have a good time
Joke a little, Toke a little
Drink a little wine[Immortal Technique]

Somebody talked shit to me in L.A. and never lived
Cause brown roll deeper than red or blue ever did
I got bullets that'll rip through your ribs
More painful than watching R. Kelly piss on your kids
Here's the ultimatum mothafucka
Give me that *ASCAP*
Or give America Biggie and 2Pac flashbacks
Some niggas don't think the Underground is grimy and dirty
'Til they find your body on a fucking highway in Jersey
I fire rockets at generic topics
Your lyrics don't hold weight
Like two-dimensional objects
Cause jail culture didn't give you that fitted hat
To memorize a ghostwritten shit verse and spit it back
I won't let your wack rhymes redefine lyricism
For a whole generation with their fathers in prison
You live inside the image of an Era that's gone
Like government officials trying to justify Vietnam
I'll leave niggas traumatized like they momma died
And they was responsible for the driveby homicide
And I don't market revolution, I live it
What you think cause you fake everyone else is a gimmick
Jealous bickering, industry slaves, the nerve of you
Like a child prostitute born into a life of servitude
Until we murder you making the red carpet burgundy
The Psycho Realm and the streets were I prefer to be

Well its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it

[Sick Jacken of Sick Symphonies]

You're on some bullshit tracks I spit them full clip raps
While most of these 'gangsta rappers' are some full fledge rats
The real Gs stay strapped in full combat
What you see in the videos is full on acts
The streets don't believe you homie
Armaggeddon in the rap game is coming and we lead the army
Rock 'Terror Tape' out of your sounds
Got hostages in pink, this is what they call hip hop now
I keep that metro shit out of my whip
Man that dummy rap is thru, making money is about to extinct
You know the radio is trying to kill rap with that shit
The only thing dying is the DJs when the K spit
We'll hit his CEOs and blow up A&Rs
Im taking your chips like crashing your game of cards
This is how I eat holmes I will give you bars
And take the life of these stars for the state of ours

Im from the city of fallen stars the home of bangin hard
Waitin for them at the Radio City Hall to snatch em out their fuckin cars
Expose em for what they are: narcs, jakes, snake informants
Feeding us horse shit, blaze up all of them
They say hip hop doesn't exist
Rappers talking hard dressed up like punk rock kids
Pumped up by some corporate endorsement dead corpses are voiceless
No one hears ya homie, ya little fame is over
We'll send little homies for closer like bankers cuz you owe us the mortgage
For exploiting the lifestyle that many died, jailed up for storage
Leaving most of us hopeless homies radio focused
What we're building got em all afraid
Gimme the K I'll be honored to ignite the flame
That'll burn down the game, whats fame? Keep it..
A movement.. a sonic war, motherfucka you sleepin

Sonny:
Now i'm tired of makin' all these other mothafuckas money
While they sit back and leave it all up to sonny
It's been a long time i've worked for these lying pieces of shit
Now i'm trying to make my own grip
For so long, i've been number two
Fuck that. i got to break of and make my own crew
Im tired of being held back and lied to
Like a vato with no respect see what i do
Jakin' the old fool and takin' over everything
And every mothafucka with 'em gotta die too
It's time for a change of power
I planted two gaurds on the watch tower

(dialogue)

Joaquin:
Im the vato's right hand man, main man, gato
And when he goes out, im takin' over the scam
I ran a little block for tax, everybody for static control
Now i hold a position for sure
Over those who roll they get in my way they lay
Im a hole tryin' to tamper goal
Tryin' to move in like this cuban thinks it's his spot
But ther's no room for the two at the top
Word is he's tryin' to serve this organization
For the unnotted service
The boss is getting nervous
This is my chance to advance; im getting cynical
This guy being alive makes the situation critical

(dialogue)

Gus:
Why am i being shacked in chains
They claim i am wanted murderous assist man
At first i thought it was a government scheme
Sticking me at the center of the crime scene
It seems i've been held for, being helpful
In a homicide; why'd they try to give me life double
When i was made(wasn't i made) untouchable
By my family?give my life to crime committe
Now in a time of need, you're saying fuck me
What makes you wanna play me shady
I protected your life, now im offered as sacrifice
To the law with no ties at all
When the boss dies, he whole kingdom fallsArtist: Psycho Realm f/ B-Real

Joaquin:
It's seven and a half sharp this things about to start
My whole crew's being torn apart
By a spark of the greed cause everybody needs
And if you're in the way they spray you bleed
The bad breed punks like sonny with dreams of running
The whole show trippin' off control and money

Sonny:
It's close to the time all my soldiers are in line
It's my motherfuckin' time to shine
All my soldiers are outside waiting for my sign
Big roller hostile take over
I won't hesitate to blow his old ass and be mero mero
You can't teach and old perro new tricks
So when i give you the signal take 'em out quick

Joaquin:
There's a knock on the door, it must be sonny
Watch him and his clique empty your clip if they trip
Yo, sonny, come inside i'm glad you arrived
Have a seat and the boss will be right with you in five

Sonny:
What? fuck that shit. i ain't got time for this
I got buisness to take care of with jesus, bitch
Get him out here in a hurry
And get the fuck out my face before you get buried

Gus:
I kicked down the door he thought he was dead
Lead staring at his head, this is what he said
Gustavo... it's nice to see you, huh
I said why the fuck did i get sacrificed?
You sold my soul to the devil
Now im livin' life at a strange level
I come back for the big payback
You don't wanna catch the bullet back so step back
Bring your arms around slow from the front to the back
Don't try and move quick don't try and move too fast
Revenge already calls for the gun to go blast
You don't wanna die for this pig ally
I plan for 15 years to kill this man

Joaquin:
And i'll have to be the one to fuck up your plans
It's on; they set it off my crew bare arms
Everybody in the scope gets smoked tryin' to fuck with the don

Sonny:
Fuck it. i'm going for broke let the gun smoke
Fill the room put jesus in his fuckin' tomb
I'm mgoing for mine and he's going for his
I'll piss on your grave and kill all your kids
Fuck all of youI always wondered what death would be like
Especially when duke died and came back
And said he didn't see light
Was that a glimpse into eternal sleep? no afterlife?
Or promise of hell? the mystery as dark as the night
All signs told me my days were numbered walking the earth
And I'd go out just as bloody as I did on my birth
My mother in pain she's still alive feeling the hurt
But my agony died with me when the weaponry burst
Was it my destiny to lead a caravan in a hearse?
I always thought I'd lead revolutionary victory first
But my enemy caught me slipping and dealt me the curse
Now all my mind could think about is this verse

(chorus)
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I can't sleep like I'm battling meth
The reaper creeps while I'm gasping for breath
I ask the lord to forgive me for debt
When death comes and my soul leaves my body to rest

No angels on my arrival and no light either
This might be the end of the road where life leaves you
Athiest prophecy looking likely firm non-believers
Faith is their robbery loot
Religion cashing out on the dreamers
In the corner of this room I'm looking at my body
It's lifeless from a trife death with holes from a shotty
Most of my limbs rotting, cold? yeah probably
I'm tripping cause I'm in the middle of the spiritual
And physical parting
I wonder if this land of shadows is my purgatory
And wonder why if I was semi-righteous
Did my end have murder for me
When I was young, man, I heard this story
If you don't reach your mission in life
You get a second chance for glory
Is there revival for a common man?
Is that survival for the godly plan?
The bible blueprints the last stand
God and devil armageddon - blast gangs
I reincarnate reborn with a gasmask

(bridge)
I don't think I'm alive I know I died
Didn't survive the enemy gun fire
This ain't hell it's far from heaven
All I remember we was fighting
In the war of armageddon... now I'm
Stuck in a spiritual realm I don't think I'm going to
Either heaven or hell I'm being sent back so we
Can help and get it right this last time
We won't fail

(chorus)"Don't be a good neighbour to her
I'll send a love letter
Straight from my heart, fucker!
You know what a love letter is
It's a bullet from a fuckin' gun, fucker!
You receive a love letter from me
And you're fucked for ever"

[All]
L to the O to the V to the E, love!

[B-Real]
Is the word that I'm thinking of
Sometimes I sit back and try to figure it out
How it can break the strongest man down
To his very last compound
I took a fall cause I went out for the love
That I shared with a woman who didn't care
I tried to give her my all and change my shit up
But she didn't give a fuck about that when she decided to get up
Fuck all the good time, just remember the bad
Fuck me and fuck all the love we used to have
Chillin' at the clubs, your friends and my friends
Hangin' out all night, driving around in the Benz
Fuckin' off all my ends but I can't pretend
Not fell the pain inside, suicide crossed my mind
Every time I heard your name
But I got strong and realized it's all about the game
Now you're all just the same

Chorus: [All]
L to the O to the V to the E, love!
L to the O to the V to the E
L to the O to the V to the E, love!
L to the O to the V to the E

[Duke]
Fuck love, I just can't get enough of your freaky ass baby
Sexy mothafucka, when you walk by and I wanna go for a ride
You hit like drugs, or red wine I'm blind
Drivin' through your world sky high
Flyin' through your town like wind sex triangle
Circles of sin begin, spinnin' I'm happy grinnin'
Sufferin' over pussy I'm fuckin'
He's stuck like a truck and I'm like you
Scandalous slut what's up
Where's your man probably with the puta that says she loves me
My heart grows cold and hard as stone
Time goes by and the last laugh is mine

Chorus[Verse 1: Cynic]
These lames they all trick n ride
With them I don't really vibe
I rather study character
Then drink & try to socialize
My pockets is alright
I got my own fucking high
Got my own bitches too
So homie keep passing me by
It's never personal, I'm telling you why
Cuz I been around the world
And everywhere is the same lie
I been around the world, not everywhere is the same high
If the homies smash your girl
Guaranteed she's gonna tell you bye
These broads love me, cuz I gave 'em the knowledge
I teach 'em things
In a couple months, they gonna learn in college
Explain, create your stories
While she slurping & vibing
We talking religion, science, astrology
Big bang theory, while she moaning & swallowing
She knows I'm from the streets, so she thinks I'm astonishing
I love life, I live it with no limits
When it's all said & done, will they be there when I finish
(when I finish, when I finish)

[Hook]
Yo, I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
You hit like drugs, sexy mothafucka
So we can never be a couple hun
Yo, I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
You hit like drugs, sexy mothafucka
Fuck love, all I got for ho's is hard dick and bubble gum

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
Yo, I lay back in the cut like..
The world is mine, and all I need is one mic
One bottle and one broad, I Just might
I still like to live the single life some nights
Only problem, bitches come back when its done right
Tell 'em what they wanna hear
Verbal skill is dumb nice
Spit in her mouth while digging her out
Dick in the trout
The broads dig it, cuz I'm big in the south
Empty promises, no games
I just can't be honest
It's fuck love
Groupie Puss thrown at the artists (damn)
What am I to do?
When she make it hard
Just one thing to do, stick it in her orifice
I make 'em feel like I love 'em for just a bit
And always lose, when we start to play just the tip
Had good times and got busted a grip
It's your fault cuz you trusted the dick
You're mind fucked bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
I bet I'll fuck that bitch
Even though she looking at me, like I ain't shit
Look I got more confidence then I got hair
What chu think you a dime bitch? pft I don't care
You can stand over there, thinking you too good
We drinking Hennessy, so you think that we too hood
Like we just some thugs, who ain't about shit
But before you start to judge, let break down your outfit
50 dollar shoes with your 50 dollar dress on
Homemade manicure, nothing but some press-ons
Smelling like the perfume on sale at Sephora
40 Dollar bag but you paid more for it
These Forever 21 broads, ain't about nothin'
That's why they ass will be forever looking for husband
You see 'em mind fuck 'em
Break down their self-esteem
Then build em back up and have playing for your team

[Hook]I'm from the family Sick Symphonies underground crowds are into me
Got out the industry cause the label became my enemy
It wasn't meant to be the machine was just trying to censor me
Didn't do it for Sony so they ended up releasing me
Independent no longer locked down for an infinity
So my vicinity remains true to my identity
Sick Jacken exploiting the sound verbal attacking ear drums
From where you're standing you'll catch the rapping
Music Of The Mask infiltrate past blast out your loud speaker
Haters get ass we get the last laugh like Bloodstone
Look at the picture tell me what's wrong
Earthquake weather turned LA into a flood zone
We dry it up come with the raw when we transmit the rhyme network
Psycho Realm that's my conecta

Sick fucks backing the music with drugs
And now we're taking over the scene we're straight thugs
Hit the exit move the package as we get it
Sick dogs push in the gates and invade it
Moving the revolution through using
All kinds of musical forms of confusion
You win the area battle raw fusion
And fights that light up the night and spell ruin
For street teams caught in youth groups of two's and three's
Means they're shooting soldiers into the county

Radio alerting the streets reach those available
Decide which way to go and which not we move unfadable
Unbreakable underground sounds will be invading you
There's nothing you could do we're breaking through

We move through kingdoms of violent silent weapons
Employ those firing
We're dying
While the puppet master's jerking strings smiling we're fighting
In the street ring not even defying the plan
They set the money bait and we're biting
We document images on song using vocal print
On how you get prepared to go to war against the monument
It's always been and will always be crooked government
Controlling the streets running shit while we're gunning it
Die on it bleed with more numbers than we succeed
Statistics recording the growth of the bad seed
Moving through streets packing my piece watching for peace disruption
And the corruption on the police don't cease
Is there an ending before decease?
Or is death the only exit buried and then released?

Moving through streets we see enemy forces
We drop multi bombs and then flee
All competition will reach defeat
And targets in my mission will die technically
Physically bringing you storm it's on
'Til the end of the war has been won you've been warned
Swarm with the strength of destructive psyclones
And police crews get introduced to straight harm
Abused cause you want me to lose
They're to protect and serve but never to follow the rules
Street soldiers refuse
We come in the midst of hate with the fate then you're through

Radio alerting the streets reach those available
Decide which way to go and which not we move unfadable
Unbreakable underground sounds will be invading you
There's nothing you could do we're breaking throughThe simplest shit ain't plain to see
Chaos floods the life on these streets
Took a wrong turn on burned concrete
And now the enemy dies for free
Real young guns are kept firing
And the clowns that are holding it down are smiling
We kill our own and bring sirens
And act out the ultimate plans of fighting

Chaos serves as smoke repeated hoax to screen
We lose control confused in the midst of staged scenes
Media invented unrelented reports presented
Often enough to make us think our world's tormented
Sentenced by the momentous news of feuds we side and choose
Use weapons and step in the trap we lose
Pick up wars designed to scar and kill ours
All because the broadcast flashed ghetto stars
How much television you watch you tube whores?
Keep score and wake up or they'll do it some more

Crazy times and wild headlines
Document the city routine with hard rhymes
Blinded street teams clash
And push our message across the news flash
Baldheads are sick minded
And anyone who crosses the path is found dead
Through TV set nonsense
We sit and fit as the face of violence

(CHORUS)
We roam the streets all lost
And get caught up in a world of chaos
Survive or defeat concrete jungle
Ex-out the weak order out of wild streets
We roam the streets all lost
And get caught up in a world of chaos
Survive or defeat concrete jungle
Ex-out the weak order out of wild streets

They keep order by making street corners gang borders
Beating down king and setting the theme for riot starters
Cop quarters can't maintain the disorder
So they call the National Guard to come strike harder
Rolling deep headed for Florence and Normandy where all you see
Building on fire chaos on Roman streets
Hope is cheap sold by the local thief relief from the common grief
Served on a platter shatter your smallest dreams
Pig chiefs are referees on gladiator fields
We're too busy dodging the sword truth stays unrevealed
Sealed all filled in the federal cabinets
Classified order through chaos for world inhabitants
Can you survive these real hard times?
Wild confrontations of mine, well, alright
We go to the streets at night
And fight in the sick-ass side show of mine
We play the government role
And straight up fuckin' smoke the rival
We plan you will fall
And leave you wasted on arrival

CHORUS (x1)[Hook: Sick Jacken]
Fiend when the leno gets put to the flame
Caps and 'shrooms stems to alter my brain
Drop a few tabs to make me insane
Then lose myself in a realm of strange days
My pusher helps me reach a sick domain
Sober's out of range, it's over, I've changed
Lose yourself and your name in a pile of cocaine
Slave to the drug that slugs all my pain
Pow Wow... [Echoes]
Pow Wow... [Echoes]

[Sick Jacken]
Smoke crawls through the tube of the mask, I take a blast
Faceless figure, you can't see through the clouded glass
Consuming herb gas, let loose the straps and pass
Like inked clowns we laugh
Through ancient indian rites we pow wow at night
With bow wows take full flight
Let the peace pipe ignite insight
Spark the light then invite the right zone
Taking you on the ultimate high
Despite the legal status we find ways to have it
Some to create some simply cause they're addicts
Always at it like drug nymphos, burn info
Memory loss because they puff indo

[Sick Duke]
Hear the tone of my vocal chords and get stoned
On the streets I'm a drug zone, homes
Roam in you head in your psyclone
Sicko mindstate full blown
Come load up the ammo
White paper wraps indo and freaks your weed ho
Let the smoke settle
Deep in the mind of a big time fiend and you'll see
Good and bad times
Your real life scene turns into fields of sick dreams
Using anything to get high sicko
Will you come back or remain trapped?

[Hook]
Fiend when the leno gets put to the flame
Caps and 'shrooms stems to alter my brain
Drop a few tabs to make me insane
Then lose myself in a realm of strange days
My pusher helps me reach a sick domain
Sober's out of range, it's over, I've changed
Lose yourself and your name in a pile of cocaine
Slave to the drug that slugs all my pain
Pow Wow.. [Echoes]
Pow Wow.. [Echoes]

Lose yourself and your name in strange days like drug slaves

[Sick Duke]
Indian style, come with us red-eyed
And there will be no lies
I'm seeing visions
In the desert we were all trippin', I'm stuck
Can't see shit just the next drug hit
'Til I'm dead I'll keep my head lit
Overdoses and greedy ass loads
For those that want to walk these roads
Let the drug settle

[Sick Jacken]
I see in three dimensions no question
Cause I D.A.R.E.D. to overcome drug prevention
Tried to avoid it but I guess I was destined
For mind expansion, the kind to write text in
'Til in peace I'm resting forever getting high
'Til I get the ultimate high in heaven
But 'til then I keep myself bound to the limit
Won't O.D. unless I predict it in lyrics
And when you hear it I've overcome death and don't fear it
I'm one who never smokes simply for gimmick
I speak it, I live it, blaze to enhance my spirit
Calm my nerves so I don't go out and smack critics
We're inked outcasts who inhale grass to get a grasp
Life's a hard task for low class
So we maintain by numbing our brain with pain killers
Some snort dust and others use vein fillers
My crew smokes chronic pillars used to chill us
As long as there's addicts the president remains the biggest dealer

[Sick Duke]
Who's your pusher, baby?
Sick dogs pushing these drugs and dicks in your guts
You get fucked
Drunk sluts act scandalous
Minds get lost and your bodies feel lust
We stay high
Just don't want to be sober, why try?
You run around in the mix of fiends trying to get re-upped
All kinds of good drugs got you fucked up
So now you just need a fix somehow
Call up your dogs and have your pow wow[Big Duke Spanish Intro]
Para toda la gente!
Lo que va pasar aqui
Son recursos de el nuevo mundo
Todo se tiene que arreglar aqui
Por que aqui nadie me manda!

[Verse 1: B-Real]
I got mad visions, pictures and premonitions
Of war drums and suicide missions
Prosecution, execution, revolution, mass confusion
All over ready for war, I'm a soldier
Nightmares of cross-airs, concentration camps
And electric chairs marking you with the stamp
Prepare yourself
Am I paranoid? why in my dreams, have I seen
The whole world destroyed?
Civilization raped, ain't no escape
Situations escalate in the date of 2001
Revelation, or is it just my imagination?
Invasion dreams reoccuring
I can't explain it
But it's the same one everyday

[Big Duke Spanish Battle Cry]
Ustedes quieren siguir viviendo?
En esta pesadia?
Que las authoridades nos quiten todos los derechos
Y las posessiones

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Televisions trackers citizens massacres
And cashless systems
The new order with no border renegades
To rule over the new age Malaise
Picture the gray haze consuming the world
This dream never goes away
I wish I knew the meaning of all this
Cause the pieces of the puzzle just don't fit
(Get out of that fox hole soldier!
Step back!
The enemy is upon us! Arrgh!)
[Verse 3: B-Real]
Premonitions of war cloud my every thought
Battles fought, won and lost a holocaust
Always the same ending, don't ever change
But I refuse to believe we all go down in flames
I wake up in the middle of combat
From the attack of the bomb killing on impact
Disintegration over the whole nation
And overseas victory to our enemies

[Big Duke Spanish Outro]
No te rias!
De la calle federal la libertad civil
De toda la gente aqui de nosotros
Esto no va parar hasta que no consigamos la justicia
El mantenimiento
Y la educaccion
De nuestra armada
Es importante para mantener todo
Todo aqui en orden
No la orden del nuevo mundo
La orden del nuevo mundo, no!
NUNCA!!We came to drop these styles; It's no shock
We rock 'til the cops come and knock non-stop

We come from Psycho Cities and Blocks
We're raisedby gunshots low life in hip hop

Despite the rules I choose to be one of the chosen few
Leavin you confused, dazed and what got you all amazed
How the fuck we could be so blazed?
It takes one block to fill your life with terror
Think of all your bullet holes embedded in your area
Bullet, bullet and in the end, who gets shot
By motherfuckers making hip hop?
We came here to get you high, represent underdogs world-wide
On the hustle leading crooked lives
We don't die, we multiply; but we divide
So how are we gonna survive?
You got your role, I got mine; dont cross paths
Cause an intersection's just another form of clash, we crash

Due to violent environments, crimes terrorize rhyme events
I'm bringing the streets to the stage, rockin your front page
L.A., street families are crumblin we legacies
There must be some type of way out of this pain
Said the joker chain smokin weed train
Take aim stop random cappin, shoot a hootah captain

Chorus:

We came to drop these styles, it's no shock
We rock 'til the cops come and rock non-stop
Do you rock or do you get locked in fights with Glocks?
The Psycho Realm's spraying out your box
We come from psycho cities and blocks
We're raised by gunshots and low life in hip-hop
Do you rock or do you get locked in fights with Glocks?
We come from psycho cities and blocks

Will spirits dancing in the flesh accept
When somebody changes the music and the tune is death
We don't dance around bonfires
We get stoned, tripped or wired
In memory of those expired
My people's exodus results in prejudice
You ask us why, in poverty, we become terrorists
Now let me tell you this: we don't choose to tote gats
And sellin on the corner is to avoid tax
If you gun talk or hip-hop there's too much division
So find a new mission or it'll stop
We do our thing, talk slang, live on fast lanes
Some do it for money, and others for the fame
You're out playin games dangerous with high aim
How long will you maintain before you get slain?

Clearing the mind but my soul is mad
Tendency to act real bad
Come across me don't c.o.m.e. out at n.i.g.h.t
Yeah, we the fuckin crazy youth from the streets freely
You see me Pelon Psyclone delivering a metal rainstorm

Chorus[Mr. Duke]
Run around downtown, cliques throw down in the mix
Clowns and infinite showdowns
Battle grounds all break downs; world's upside down
Making wicked smiles wicked frowns, we get down
With our own gangster sound
Static kingdoms break you and your manhood shallow
With shanks of venom metal
Rattle fuckin' snakes I'm as high as the stakes
Quarter ounce of weed to the head no breaks home wait
Street wars we get in them
Furious fist on my wrist is gonna get them and you

[Sick Jacken]
Out of frictions comes static causing mad panic
On the streets, the dramatic battles increase
We see more wars, less peace, we're even fighting police
Resulting, they're biggest enemies
Lifestyles of the criminal be wild
You wanna see more action, hold up wait a while
Fist crash giants clash
Putting on the face of the devil mask doing brain bash

[Hook: Mr. Duke]
Look out for the showdown
Crazy in the head locos 'bout to throw down
Look out for the showdown
Crazy in the head locos 'bout to throw down

[B-Real]
Watch out, look out, look out, watch out
For the showdown, you better slow down
Give me fifty feet or better
Keep your eye on the barrel of the beretta
The lead comin' to wet'cha
Spread your body parts all over the continent
I'm a dominant mothafucka, but you're the opposite
Turn around put your hands on the side
Are you aligned by the sunshine on your gun
The outcome: you're just another one soul
Flyin' into the heavens hit by the '57
Ass end scrapping, illuminating the whole block
They all flock in anticipation
You're getting rolled by the dayton
Now I see your hand shaking
You want our of this situation

[Hook]

[Sick Jacken]
Images of war weapons the psycho presence
Blood wettens, stains the curb where you're steppin'
Deadly ground's the home of all showdowns
Come into my kingdom , sirens rattle eardrums
It ain't one on one no more, it' gun on gun
Bullets take the place of fists so what's the outcome
Crazy wars, severe scars
If you're just like me, you're defending what's yours
Taking no loss

[Mr. Duke]
We're heavy duty like tanks
This is my two chrome shanks
Criminal styles point blank
You think my music is crazy like Tony Montana
Fumando marijuana con Santana tomorrow
I might not be alive, so I wanna bring all the enemy's sorrow
I rock the block with the music maniac
Tar back locos seekin' that warpath
Why don't punks be legit, they ell bring havoc in their head
A psycho one will shoot them dead
That's the fundamental to a fucked up mental
Now you got a gun, your life's a psycho realm
My strategy assault battery
Runnin' through your neighborhood in cliques of three
Smokin' in the battlegrounds on wild streets
And wild showdowns, enemy take a look around

[Hook][Intro: Mr Duke]
This jam right here is dedicated
To all you motherfucker that ain't right here
You're supposed to be right here with me, motherfucker
You know what I'm saying ?
You know what the fuck I'm saying
I'll catch up with you soon, homies
Ah ah, yeah, we'll catch up to you all
All of you motherfucker
And you know what I'm saying
Cause at the end, at the end we all diiiie

[Jacken]
Sounds like Gods are crying tears of Malathion
Raining over your head to put out the fire
Who desires to die? besides, the suicidal tendencies
Can lead to the eternal sleep
So keep you eyes wide open and alive
Grab your snake and ride to the other side
If your intention is to defy death
I'll tell you now, even the best get laid to rest
We're on our way to the stone garden
End of the road were everybody goes but not forgotten
Frames all rotten souls travel to unravel
Other worlds and big cloud castles
Why do we have these hassles, livin' cautious
Walking the street watching your back?
Your fear's collosus
We conquer souls while ganja rolls
Everybody here's high so the story unfolds
We're on another planet thought, thinking immortal
But the path we're on leads us straight to the portal

[Hook: Jacken & (Mr Duke)]
(Devil's in disguise)
They're coming to claim us
Let it come as no surprise
I stare into the face of death
Cause at the end of their time, everybody dies

[Mr Duke]
This is a time of pain
Warzone for your own gain
I roam the middle with the metal cause I'm insane
Break frames... catch a smoking
Is it gonna earn you a name?
Did you get slain?
Or fall victim to bald knuckle-heads and bad aim
It ends all the same
Every mothafucker right here gotta jump on soul train
Some go up, some go south
Some get stuck in a realm with no way out
Some get to hide, O.D. on drug hits
Dying in your sleep, that's the shit
But lives get took violently
On the streets of a lost city

[Hook: Jacken & (Mr Duke) x4]

[B-Real]
In the stone garden, we keep all the heavenly gates packed
With fresh souls under control, no holdin' back
Look at all these names engraved in the stones
Even the unknown finds his path on his way home
Roam... where the spirits all lie
One of these fuckin' days, even I'm gonna die
And when I do, I'll be another memory
Hanging out with the ones who were there before me
Look out haaa... let me set your soul free
By the Buddha tree, open the gates to eternity
Everybody rise up, open up your eyes
We demise and we're trippin' to the other side

[Hook: Jacken & (Mr Duke) x2]

[Mr Duke speaking]
Yeah at the end, at the end
We'll catch up with you
You know what I'm saying, that's it
We all die then motherfucker
Yeah even if you take me out by now
One of my motherfucker's gonna take you up
And then you'll take him and back and forth and shit
And it don't stop you know what I'm saying
Body rott drop and shit
You know what I mean
Ah ah

This is the endBig Duke Chorus (x1)
Time is short and my life is sick
That's how it is man look at this shit
You get abused by street platoons
Hit you like wind and what-cha gonna do?
We break circles of enemies blocks get shot with defeat
They say no drive-by's on the street
So mutha-fuckas run rival sweeps

[Verse 1: Big Duke]

Sick platoons flood the streets of Los
Like a sick typhoon
Mutha-fuckas drive by world wide
And everybody you and I know dies
The only guarantee in life is death your last breath
Come when your famo least expect it
Soldier run wild in your song
Red dawn strikes your back in dead 'nam
Your mind's flipping but the scene's dead calm
And your whole world's thrown and wrapped in psyclone
Alright ride through the city like that
Pants, T-shirts are creased and stole gats
LA undercover shoot to kill
Child of the streets run wild in war fields
Scheming on pigs that start shit
Guilty treat us all dirty filthy

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]

The streets are flooded with budded corrupted minds running
Those who can't cut it
Leave the hoodlum studded ghetto wondering what is
The excuse or reason for high treason
In blasting season leaving one of your color bleeding
Repeating never stopping body dropping
'Hood rocking window glocking zone shocking
Defending pavement attacking, facing arraignment
Jail's enslavement shackled for justice to the plaintiff
When the charges stick that's it you get hit with some bid
For what you did prevent and rid some kid of his chance to live
Cause of the block he lives in
Not giving a fuck just trying to win your block ribbon
Glock driven joining street platoons like it's some fashion
Going out of style so you catch it for some action
It's no joke homeboys get smoked, poked, cause they provoke
Locked on dope no hope for growth that's why we're broke
Short pocket street criminals fail to lock it but crime sky rockets
So where the fuck is the profit?
Maybe in hands of those who supply drugs and weapons
Let's take that shit back by forming neighborhood connections

Big Duke Chorus (x1)
