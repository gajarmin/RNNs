[Verse 1: Grieves]
Last time I wrote a song like this I was drunk off the last words out of your lips
And what a world –
You were always looking for attention, I was holding on to my abandonment obsession
In hindsight –
I was just as ignorant as you were, blinded by the "you" word combined by the sutures
Good-bye to the cruel world, you had to be out, and I caught you with another dudes -–-- in your mouth
Goddamn little lady, how’d you get so cold?
How’d life teach you all the little tricks you pulled on me?
Hopelessly passionate, openly act as if everything is all my fault – no sacrifice
Nah, I should’ve seen it from the start, red dress laying on the floor in the dark
You were everything I wanted but nothing that I needed
My sexy little piece of shit demon, leaving

[Hook]
I used to say that I loved you
I used to act like a fool
But now I hear that you’re wondering, if the girl I run with
Is treating me cool –

You fucking gotta be kidding me
Look at all that you did to me
Why the hell would you be wondering who’s kissing me now?
[x2]

[Verse 2: Grieves]
Last time I had a thought like this I was locked in my room with a bottle in my fist
What a world –
I was trying to pick apart the pieces, even moved to Cali with you, living by the beaches
Egregious –
Made a dude want to find Jesus, huddled in bunker with nothing but canned peaches
If I was a weaker man I would’ve broke down, the second I caught you getting your sex around town
God-damn, what a hell of a ride, Cinderella got drunk and started spreading her thighs
The fairy tale’s over, after telling me lies – became a rock in the belly of the reason we fight
Yeah, I should’ve seen it from the jump, I should’ve shut the door on your face and called you a -–-
Everything I wanted, but nothing that I needed
My sexy little piece of shit creampuff, biatch

[Hook]
I used to say that I loved you
I used to act like a fool
But now I hear that you’re wondering, if the girl I run with
Is treating me cool –

You fucking gotta be kidding me, look at all that you did to me
Why the hell would you be wondering who’s kissing me now?
[x2]If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy

[Verse 1: K.Flay]
My daddy was an asshole
At least I think he was, never knew him well enough
He developed quite a habit, bit the dust so a cause to be nuts I got hell of ones
And whether that’s even relevant
Well I don’t know for sure, but I’ve been so disturbed
And I’d like an explanation
For the havoc in my life I’ve been creating
My friend said the reason I’m alone’s I’m a bad girl
Got a knife in my arm
But the scar’s in my bones guess I better with deal with that first
Say, say I what I want when I don’t even know, then apologize after
Seems like the pace of my mistakes keeps accelerating faster
And I find that when the sun has set, I beg for more and more punishment
Getting tough again looking for a cure, some kind of medicine
Like a way fix it, but I’ve found that really nothing can

If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy

[Verse 2: Eligh]
You don't wanna fuck around with my mind
Cuz my mind is a dangerous vine
To find yourself intertwined with or aligned with
Kinda fine but the man is kinda twisted
Is it my fault or is it salt up in the wound
That's been there since the womb
The world is my time gauge
I feel prime rage rise from the rib cage
When I'm feeling jealousies, I hella breathe
To bring a freeze to your bones
And leave you on your knees and all alone
You get the perfect view of the tattoo
On the back of my neck when I lose my love for you
I hover over, love is like a poltergeist
I will haunt your life and make you feel again
I feel the feelings of a mad man and when I can't rant
I leave a mess behind and call the HAZMAT team
I need a vaccine
I'm crazy and I know it
Pass, clean it out, I got some residue
I'm not the perfect man I'm telling you
He's hella cool but he got issues
If you choose to make that move
Make sure you bring some tissues girl
Wish you well on this escapade
I learned my lessons way before today

If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy

[Verse 3: Grieves]
No doubt about it baby I'm a blind mess
With buzzard flying circles over my head
Try to deny for a minute that I said
It's a above me waiting patiently for my death
Bet your shrink would have a field day with me
Blame it on abandonment issues
Or something tragic that happened when I was sixteen
Close the door, stop poking around
Float fine in the waters where the hopeless drown
So stop fishing, all your gonna get is just a sunken boot
A bunch of garbage I discarded from my troubled youth
Heavy tension then there's something I suggest you walk away from before it tries to get you too
Young thing felt love would make a valiant stand
Put a calm in my life with a valium can
A grown man with a stone in his hand
Is not built for a glass-hearted delicate land

If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy[Intro]
Operator here's my dime
Connect me please
I know that she's at home

[Hook: Kno]
It's four o-clock on a Sunday morning
Who the hell is calling my phone?
Waking me up I'm stretching and yawning
If you had any sense you'd leave me alone

[Verse 1: Natti]
Wee hours of the morning and word is bond
I’m in jail I need bail. Again, the word is bond
Not James in a tux with olives draped on my cup
With a dame all on me with healthy letters to cup
So what up?
Can you free me ‘fore my prints get back?
And they run em through the system and realize that I'm black
All I remember was the stripper then I faded to rack
Said her name was December than she sat on my lap
"Merry Crimmuh"
Liquor and higher power my witness
I thought fleeing The People was just a matter of fitness
With all these nice drinks, compliments of Dennis
Whoever the fuck that is
"Dennis is this!"
Two middle fingers up
"Dennis is this!"
Dennis tab maxed out on titties and fifths
Whoever the fuck Dennis, is Dennis is pissed!
Cus I don’t think that dude we was drinking with was Dennis at all, fam!

[Hook: Kno]

[Verse 2: Grieves]
Ha, Yup
Im aware it’s four in the morning
But I just wanna tell you im drunk and im kinda horny
I know it gets annoying, but I been losing my grip
Every woman I talk to I treat like a fair piss and it’s a bitch
Mainly cuz I now consider you one
I wanna let you go, but every time I seem to screw up
Now that’s the problem with the space that you occupy
It’s going great and then the thought of you would cross my mind
A box of wine and a carton of coffin nails will
Convince me now would be a great time for hate mailin’
Like "Hey bitch! How the hell have you been?
Remember me? We were dating and you slept with my friends!"
I just thought that I’d remind you in case you ever forget it
And train yourself to believe that you're not a terrible wretch
Ha
You broke my heart into like a million pieces
So here’s another dim-litted picture of my penis

[Verse 3: Murs]
Whoa!
What the fuck is going on Grieves
You saved my number under the wrong name in your phone?
Is that a picture of your...?
I'ma pretend I didn't see that
All that rain got you suicidal up in Seatt...ohhhhh
You had to much to drink again
Whiskey and a cellphone ain't never gonna be your friend
You booze you lose, homie you been warned
You better off using your cellphone to watch porn
Grab some lotion & a napkin
Jack off then pass out
All these drunk texts'll have you fucked off and ass out
I hope you black out before you do anymore damage
I checked your timeline, homie...why you Tweetin in Spanish?
I understand if this is what you gotta go through
But when you sober up I got some screenshots to show you
Grieves, bro trust me
And you gonna be hella happy that all of them texts didn't go through

[Hook: Kno]

[Outro: Grieves]
Ooh! Ahh!
That's the angle
*click*
She's gonna love that one[Intro]

[Verse 1: Grieves]
I was in the second grade when you pushed me out the
Third story window to the bushes down below
Breathing in the cold
As I tumbled through the vines' thorns smiling at my throat
I, I saw the devil in you that day
Looking down at me with that face
Smiling like you would have hid my body in the basement
Body in the Basement
But you got something that the world's been running from
For way too long and it's a sick twist
A nervous little twitch
Dragging the razors across my wrists
And you got something that the world's been trying to hide
You're cyanide
Cause the only thing you told me was
They'd never find my body in the basement
Body in the basement, no

[Hook: Grieves]
Every time I think about you know I go crazy
People ask me about you
I don't know what to say
Cause I don't know who you are
I wonder if it's even possible for you to escape this
Keep on asking about you
They don't know what to tell me
They don't know who you are [x2]

[Verse 2: Grieves]
I was listening through the wall when you met your monsters
Heard'em break the closet door and take you away
Hoping you would change like the color of the moonlight
Bouncing off the rain
I, I heard the devil in you that day
Watch the world around you cascade
Laughing like you would have fed your family to the serpent
You got something that the world won't talk about
They walk around it
It's deep sleep, crawling in the street
Pushing the bayonet into me
You got something that the world keeps trapped inside
You aconite
Cause I watched you turn around
Go and try to feed you family to the serpent
Family to the serpent whole

[Bridge]
These words won't break on you I know
I've done my best to help so many times before
These words won't break on you I know
I've done my best to help

[Hook][Verse I]
Born blind in the winter with an empty head
The snow covered up the Camry, the whole house slept
Drawing pictures in the bed, waking up and racing down the stairs trying to catch my breakfast
Was so simple, superman, trick or treat, wet socks
Bike rides in the summer to the best spots
Could've sworn I was king with the best odds
Running 'round with the dogs in the backyard
Growing, never knowing what the past done
Living life like the mystery of packed lunch
Getting whooped in the playground, scratched up
Coming home after school on the last bus
Back then it was all about laughs
Hit the corner store for the new Fleer packs
Mom was a religion and happiness was a fact
It’s a shame how the time goes past
Moving so fast

[Bridge]
It’s like I’m moving at light speed
Slow Down

[Hook]
You need to slow down every once in a while, sometimes
To see how the world goes round
You need to slow down every once in a while
Cause you don’t know, you don’t know
You don’t need to go so fast

[Verse II]
Things changed and the pops job got an offer
Packed up moved out down to Colorado
Sunshine, clean air, not a lot of problems
That’s when I discovered Pogs and Tamagochi
Time passed and the friends found punk, yeah
Or whatever man, a lot of it was junk, but we loved it
Made us feel cool, little dumb kids, running 'round just for fun doing dumb shit
I was lighting all my candles at both ends
Warren Lake getting drunk with the friends
I was trying to stay positive, even though I pretended it helped, cause back home I was lacking a happy ending for all
Saw a lot of tall trees fall in the name of an addiction
My sister taught me to follow
I cracked, cleaned up and the bags packed, and swore that I would never go back
Moving so fast

[Bridge]
[Hook]

[Verse III]
19 I decided I was done with it
Hit Seattle with a head full of drum rhythms
Falling in and out of love with these young women
Thinking they can make a change in the blood given
Nah, I was too young to face it
Working two jobs still thinking I could make it
Local all-star still singing from his basement
Finally got a shot and I’ve been working every day since
Found love in the city where the Angels fly
Put a record out with Joshua, and made our climb
Came home after two years playing our rhymes
Just to find my little Angel was no more mine
Parted ways with a friend, it was not easy
Made a leap to the future and got queasy
Started working on the things that had lost reason
Now I’m sitting with a pad, moving so fast…

[Bridge]
[Hook]I don't believe in cutting corners
Own it like a scar on the face
Stand tall whether taking the gold or in last place
Not really the one to give God praise
But if you got the gospel then tell me how it taste

Hallelujah

Biting on the bullet for strength
I'm a long distance runner sucker
I'm in it for length
It's not a matter of whether or not you can play
But a scale of if you give a fuck enough to make a statement

Lay it down

[Pre-Hook]
Separate the men from the mice
Another body under halogen lights missing its life
Wondering what the hell would make you think that
You could judge another person for loving something so much it hurts the stomach

Living by the blood in my neck
With a bullseye tatted on the back of my head
I never spoke it how they wanted it to be said
So they left me for the winter and the wolves

[Hook]
Tear me into shreds
Rip me into bits
Tear another page out
Punch me in the ribs
I can smell the poison on your lips
Whatever it is I'd be willing to bet
They want to get inside my head

Tell me how it is
Sitting in a tower with a rifle and a list
I can see the razor on your lips
Whatever it is I'd be willing to bet
You should have held your breath
[/Hook]

I don't believe in sitting down
Take it like a knife in the back
You burnt out into nothing after striking the match
I've never been the type to follow the pack
So if it's true you got the answers
Then why the hell you so mad then?

Another holy ghost laid script
Clipped the wings off of my words
And buried the shiv
They want to pick apart the passion in my ribs
I invite them
Cause I don't run away from shit

Lay it out

[Bridge]
Separate the guns and the flowers
The minutes that go into all these hours
And I bet if you were given a smidgen of just the tip of the ice berg
I've had to struggle with you
Wouldn't act so sour, maybe not

Livin off the fruit of my stress
With a size twelve boot heel stepping on my chest
Didn't do it how they wanted it to end
So they threw me to the winter and wolves

[Hook] [x2][Intro]
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Now the dark days are gone and the bright days are here and my sunny side shines

[Verse 1]
Come on man, not your same old shit
I’ve been living steady wobbling on the edge
Chasing life around in circles trying to decompress my head
I feel it get intense, choose to break my bread and spread it around
Take my every single thought into this pen and jot it down
Cause it’s the truth to me, you should see
It’s all that ever helped
Held my shattered world together when I knocked it off the shelf into the blackness
Tripping over broken hearts and homes and getting close enough to turn that kid inside of me to stone
And I’ll admit it, cause I was never taught to give it up
Sailed an ocean full of drug addicted misincouraged blood
Without a paddle
It took a lot of faith to fight my battles and tackle a couple of habits I never thought that
I’d have to
But did, bottle the water under the bridge and toss another written page of my history to the wind
When it blows, cause all of this disaster has lead me home and left a lot of room for me to learn to grow
Yeah you are not alone

[Hook]
Grab hold of yourself, I know what it’s like to get blown away
I know you, that
You’ve done your dirt and you’ve dug your graves and it feels like it won’t be saved
I say grab hold yourself and face those days when you feel like it always rains
I’ve seen the sunny side of hell, that which I never
Thought I’d find for myself
Never thought I’d find for myself

[Verse 2]
Not your same old song
I’ve been writing on a mirror with a razor blade
And chased away the devil in my brain that played me like a spade
Cause day to day, painted jaded faith issues a shade of gray
And cowered, hid behind emotion just to play it safe
A pawn, slowly turning victim to my wrongs
I had to wake up all alone to finally figure out my wants
In the house of haunted love the past will keep me warned and explain me
Even if you’re listening through the storm
I found a purpose and if you heard this then sit it down
Pick its brain until it opens up and redirects the sound
The conductor, frozen thunder rumbling through the ground
With a perfect little twist of that suited armor
And crown
You created, built for denying it
Hiding the cuts and bruises due to the self-inflicted bone crushing anxiety
I’m with you, so understand that all of this within you
Has chiseled you a flower out of stone
Yeah you are not alone

[Hook]Tell me with your back against the bottom
There's somethin' 'bout these days that got you caught up
Toss another empty bottle to the bay
What did you say, what did you do
When life came crashing down on you?

I should have seen it when you broke down
Stop and listen, and stop acting like you don't have a position
Cause I could see it from the jump when I kissed you
And feel it through the walls that you constantly put your fist through
You're pissed, but you ain't gotta fight like this
Life isn't worth a dime with a knife-sliced wrist
Spent a whole bunch of time trying to write your list
But the (last thing's allowed?) to make you bite your... lip
Little girl, little love, little hold my head to the ground in the mud
Little I'm not comin' back up 'til the whole sky falls down on top of me
And breaks my trust
Now run, and think about it all
Think about the last chance given and the first round fall
And if that can't get you back to where you start
Just call, and meet me in the place where we always are

Tell me with your back against the bottom
There's somethin' 'bout these days that got you caught up
Toss another empty bottle to the bay
What did you say, what did you do
When life came crashing down on you?

I should have seen it when I came back, yup
I shoulda...
Cause you don't see the things that I really wish that you would've
No you don't make the effort I really
Thought that you could've
To unlock the cage where you put us
And take another stab at it
Fly fishin' for the catch
With my heart tied onto the only line that you cast
And if I don't sink this raft right now
I'mma float down the river 'til my
Last breaths, gasp
Yeah, little lock, little key, little drop my boxes of thoughts into the sea
No, I'm not comin' back out
'til the whole world stops in its tracks and admits its defeat
For good
Back to the shackles, back to the comfort of the things that
Attack you
And make you cold
I'm over tryin' to make this home, so just go
And leave me in the place that we'll always know

Tell me with your back against the bottom
There's somethin' 'bout these days that got you caught up
Toss another empty bottle to the bay
What did you say, what did you do
When life came crashing down on you?[Hook: Helen Chance]
My baby just cares for me [x2]
But he's never there for me [x2]
Baby it's killing me, that I may have to leave, go

[Verse 1: Grieves]
A friend of mine once told me when I was out on the road
That you have an artist inside you and you cannot be controlled
And any way that you choose it, it's gonna show
And if anyone tries to limit you, you need to let them go
Now I'm having trouble trying to find an even medium
Between trying to chase my dreams and providing you with your needs
And yea there's a fine line between it
Love colliding in battle over the use of it's meaning
And now you label this as my fault, talk with your friends
Like you've been living with the ghost of the man you go to bed with
And I need you to understand that what I've been blessed with
Is more than an investment, and isn't here to test you please
I know this is not expected, at times you feel neglected
And our love is a death wish, but I know one way to say it
I love you and wish for you to stay, I heard you saying things like

[Hook: Helen Chance]
My baby just cares for me
My baby just cares for me (I heard you saying things like)
But he's never there fo me
But he's never there for me (I heard you talking like)
Baby it's killing me, that I may have to leave, go (heard you wanna)

[Verse 2: Grieves]
There's nothing more painful than failing at love
Pack your whole life up and cover in dust
Baby I feel the tension in between us is growing stronger
And your faith in me is diminishing into nothing at all
And that's disappointing because I sacrificed a lot for you
Never did I lie to you and stray from the truth
Huh, and still you look at me and treat me as the bad guy
Giving me those sad eyes, every time I ask why
And if that's our past time, then why do you put up with it
And why are you in love with me if you can barely stomach it
It's fragile, and I know I'm distant and bashful
Hit the road for two months and didn't even ask you
On the real, I shouldn't really have to
I've dreamt of this for years, and I'm gonna take it by the handful
And now I gotta try and choose between the two of you
Seeing you hit that door is like watching you at my funeral saying

[Hook: Helen Chance]
My baby just cares for me
My baby just cares for me (I heard you saying things like)
But he's never there for me
But he's never there for me (I heard you talking like)
Baby it's killing me, that I may have to leave, go (heard you wanna)

[Outro: Grieves]
How would you expect
Close your eyes and make this better
Now for better
How would you attempt
To change the weather, when it's raining and our hearts still let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go[Verse 1: Grieves]
We used to fly around the world in a cardboard box
Now you're waiting for the bus trying to fit in with the flock
Different socks, on one hand you've got a wild imagination
And on the other, is man against the clock
It never stops, we used to look up at the clouds
And see shapes now the only thing we see in 'em is rain, it's not the same
Cause after all the giant dragons disappeared
The only battle left to fight was with your chains, cut 'em loose
I liked it better when our dreams were real
We respected what it was to feel
Nobody ever put a limit on the things that that made the littlest of kings
Seem strong enough to cut through steel, grip the wheel
It's a windy little road you paved
It's a shame you had to lose that light
Cause if it wasn't for the blanket fort walls and the bumps in the night
You'd be nothing but a string without a kite

[Chorus: Grieves]
You're not the astronaut you used to be
Ain't it shame that you couldn't keep the starlight in your eyes?
You're not the hero that you used to be
Fading away until you're falling out the sky

[Verse 2: Grieves]
We used to sail around the world in a porcelain tub
Now we fill it to the brim and try to wash away the mud, it isn't us
In one world you got a wide-eyed adventure in the other
Is a person giving up, it never jumps
We used to play connect the dots with the stars
Now we try to make a connection in bars, it's getting hard
Cause after every little planet's been exploded
It's impossible to find out where you are, I take it home
I miss the feeling of a brand-new start
What it meant to be a child at heart
No matter how it was explained it always felt like if
I wanted to I could've built a city in my own backyard, disembark
You don't have to be a kid to believe or see potential in a pile of leaves
If it wasn't for them deep sea dives
Or the whisper from the trees you'd be
Nothing but a want without a need

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Slug]
I remember you were stuck in a half-empty cup
You studied the sun like it was meant to touch, got to clutch
It's not enough to escape like the duck's
Cause they always come back to the muck
Struggle from a brush with luck so we could judge your guts like
"You still on that such and such?"
They can cut the budget but the puppet struts
On two crutches over drums that rush like busted nuts
It's too much now, you want to strike like
The light without the thunder, wonder whatcha doing uptown
You delivering nothing but love
But can't seem to catch a dream when fishing from up above
I don't believe that there's a bad bet
Cause everybody's gonna breathe that last breath
But the things you write, got wings for life
It's the freedom flight, that's how we sleep at night

[Chorus]Woke up in a cold sweat
Alone where the ghost slept
I never thought I was the type
I would have took the frost but I must have made it obvious
Cause every time it happens I'm the one who gets the bite
Fading like the lights on the last bus out of here
Kicking up dust disappear into the night
Nothing lasts forever
But judging by the weather
I'm starting to get a sick feeling thinkin' it might
And I don't want to fight you anymore Benjamin
It's a plague
A lose-lose situation in a maze with a crazed man chasing the kid in me with a blade
That's too proud to ever admit he's afraid
So pile the rocks on me
I don't know what to say
The whole worlds' watching but I don't think they relate
I was right where I landed
Simple and plain
Another victim of the sickle and the flame

The flame blows out
Won't ever see it coming
Funny how
This is all I ever wanted
Was the price you paid
When you try to cross a river without drowning

Fell asleep with my bones cold
Blowing smoke through a froze throat
Trying to focus on the flash
I would of grabbed the whip
But they must have seen me coming
Cause no matter what I do I always seem to catch the lash
Painting with the ash left sitting at the base of what I used to be pretty familiar with as home
I don't know if fate's trying to kill me
Or teach me how to grow
But either way it's got me feeling hopeless
And I don't want to climb this tattered up rope anymore, man
Sick of thinking I'ma fall
The Devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he never existed
And mine was a broken crystal ball
Looking at the shards trying to figure out the future with a bloody hand holding it together from the base
Funny how the butterflies flapping in my stomach finally figured out a way to make a valiant escape
We talk about the coals and the bats
Choking on the facts
Fighting with the current to our backs
Nobody ever promised me tomorrow more than anybody told me I would die before I ever made it back
And even if I had
It's only a matter of time until it catches up with me to loosen up my grasp
Everything I've done in the name of being strong always seems to come around and try to kill me where I stand

The flame blows out
Won't ever see it coming
Funny how
This is all I ever wanted
Was the price you paid
When you try to cross a river without drowningUnrealistic, my beautiful addiction (x2)

Eligh:
She infects my brain like nothing else
An addiction I cannot kick on my own I need some help
I stand on the peer with the fishing rod
And bait, to attract that perfect mate, my health
The tax, in a search, so I sit back, relax
Do not need feedback while on my perch
I light my torch and abort that mission
Often take it right back up the evening after
Misses me, you silly babe
And in the back of my mind you still ?
To an unrealistic I woman in ?? fate
I grade my effort B+, jesus
Can't save me from these nuts, I'm crazy, baby
Take a tip from me stay away from me
Cause I'm only out for one thing that's music, lady
Now let a shady one night binge ???
Baby just for now you might be just my style
But you're not the one so don't get stuck on the thought
Of us cause I'm in love with the dream and
Inception implanted by lust supreme
She's ???? too and a virgo with a gorgeous smile
And beautiful lips ???????
??????
Sits so intelligent my best friend and my advices
Taken with a grain of salt ????
I adore women and women adore me

You're my beautiful addiction
????? to these fictions
Though it's lust never thought it could mean this much
You're my beautiful addiction (x2)

Grieves:
I've been living the impossible dream
And found that most of the attention I'm getting Isn't appealing
And look, how the hell did you think I would've reacted
To women writing numbers on a napkin telling me I can have it
Talkin' up a one night stand with a girl that only sleeps with bands
And baby I can't stand it cause I was never raised to be a rock star
Always thought love would be an anchor when I lost heart

And I don't seem to be the kind of type, who want's to pack it up and have that life
But if you ask me right
Then maybe I would take that chance
And stop running from the flames to dance
But lately I can't stand it
The fans with the motives to fuck
And all these devil headed women ????
When I ??? to my mama she's askin' me if I'm nuts
And wondering why I'm always associating with sluts

And it hits me, this is not the life I wanted
????
I payed the price I'm gone
And I don't know if I'mma ever find it
But I'll never see the sun until I climb it
I set my sights

You're my beautiful addiction
????? to these fictions
Though it's lust never thought it could mean this much
You're my beautiful addiction (x2)Eligh:
Unrealistic, my beautiful addiction
(X2)
She infects my brain like nothing else
An addiction I can not kick on my own I need some help
I stand on the pier with the fishing rod and bait
To attract that perfect mate my health
The task, in a search, so I sit back, relax
Do not need feed back while on my perch
I light my torch and abort the mission
Often take it right back up the evening after
Misses me, you still evade
In the back of my mind you still equate
To an unrealistic woman of mystic fate
I grade my effort B+
Jesus can't save me from these nuts I'm crazy
Baby, take a tip from me, stay away from me
Cause I'm only out for one thing that's music lady luck
Now fuck a shady tuck away one night mends
Baby just for now, you might be just my style
But you're not the one
So don't get stuck on the thought of us
Cause I'm in love with a dream
An inception, implanted, by love supreme
She's tattooed, and a Virgo
With a gorgeous smile and beautiful lips
And a Leo, and a tom girl, and a Pisces
Who switches sips like Dionysus
So intelligent my best friend
And my advice is taken with a grain of salt
In acceptance of all the vices
I implore I adore women and women adore me

Your my beautiful addiction
And a strangers to these fictions
Love or its lust, never thought it could mean this much
Your my beautiful addiction, beautiful addiction
Beautiful..

Grieves:
I been livin' the impossible dream
And found it most of the attention I'm gettin' isn't appealin'
Look, how the hell do you think I would have reacted
To women writin' numbers on a napkin?
Tellin' me I can have it
Talkin' up a one night stand
With a girl that only sleeps with bands
And baby I can't stand it
Cause I was never raised to be a rock star
And always thought that love would be the anchor when I lost heart
But I don't seem to be attractin' a type
That wants to pack it up and have that life
And if you ask me right, then maybe I would take that chance
And stop runnin' from the flames that dance
But lately I can't stand it, the fans with the motives to fuck
And all these devil headed women only in it for blood
When I'm going to my mama she's askin' me if I'm nuts
And wonderin' why I'm always associated with sluts
And it hits me, this is not the life I want
And you are clearly not the wife I want
I paid the price I'm gone
And I don't know if I'm a ever find it
But I'll never see the summit 'till I climb it
I'll set my sightsI guess it started when the lights went out
And everybody started running round in circles tryin' to figure it out
I could feel it
Wedged in my ribs it felt freezin'
As my cold air blew out
Dance through the evening, paranormal
Slowly being called to the green
Where the ghosts gather nightly and sell the devil their dreams, observe
Hails from the other side of the curb
Hold the concrete notepad
Scribble down my words in the limelight
This is what it's like to bleed ink
Put yo fingers in it paint me a picture of what you think
Make it beautiful and make it look like love
Make it hang from the heavens
Make it break my trust
Make it real, make it dangerous
Make it out of the rust and make it passionate and impossible to touch
It's forever, slowly resurrected from the dust
When you understand it's everything inside of you, it's us

[Hook:]
You're all I've ever known
Sewn to my sleeve, you always got me running home
Handful of roses
You're my blood and brittle bones
My soul, an open throne
You're all I know

I've spoke a whisper in the dark one night
Watch it take form in front of me and mimic my life
It seemed natural especially watching it's last breathe like poetry
Watch as it clung to it's own chest with a smile
Made out of broken pieces of tile
You can see the thoughts running, chase em around for miles
If you want it, people say that old road is haunted
If you travel on it long enough you'll never get off it
You believe it cause everything is skewed when you see it
Then you process automatically, think that you feel it
And automatically sticks to the brain when the truth of it
Is standing outside, playing cards in the rain
You will never beat the game it plays
You can only turn around and lick the blood from your own switchblade
It's forever, slowly resurrected from the dust
When you understand it's everything inside of you, it's us

[Hook]The night is like a blanket that's suffocating the fire
With a bow to the string and a note from the choir
I believe, and that's about as far it goes
When you've been riding on the wings of a bloody murder of crows
Hold it all out, throw it into the wind
Let it lay down the line where the drama begins
Because if everything is covered and teetering on a whim
You can harmonize the sound of it's insecurity's hymn
When it's played, yeah, stripped down and shaved
Shipped off to battle in the shadow of the day
And if anything is salvaged from the battered up remains
You can sew it to your jacket and compensate for the pain
When it hits, when it speaks
Lick the blood right off of it's teeth
You'll grip those sheets in attempt to hide
And figure out that you've been running from the feeling of never leaving alive so

Hide, sleep with the lights on
You feel like you can be at peace with the lights on here
So cover up your face, and fight away that taste
That makes you want to run and hide, hide, hide
And sleep with the lights on
You stand up on your tiny feet when the night's gone here (Night's gone here)
When the night's gone here

Swallow that lump inside of your throat
Open up the closet and push aside all the clothes
You believe, and never needed more to be said
To leave you scared of that little gap between the floor and your bed
So you jump, leaping over all over your options
And retreat right back to that bed we call a coffin
To sleep, never actually getting a wink
Due to all the little devils that dance around in your dreams
And attack you, pull you under the bed with their hands
And take away the chance of you ever making a stand
And if anything actually ever went as you planned
That you could retrace the steps you ran
But only if it hits, if it speaks
You could fight it to the death in the streets
You'll grip those sheets in attempt to hide
And figure out that you've been running from the feeling of never leaving alive

So hide, you'll stay awake
So hide, we all know that you'll stay awake

Hide, sleep with the lights on
You feel like you can be at peace with the lights on here
So cover up your face, and fight away that taste
That makes you want to run and hide, hide, hide
And sleep with the lights on
You stand up on your tiny feet when the night's gone here (Night's gone here)
When the night's gone here[Verse 1: Grieves]

My whole life, I've been staring out the cracks
Slipping words amongst the people that get close enough to grasp it
You're looking at me like another broken glass
Getting closer to the edge with our emotional attachment
And, maybe you won't see that all of this around you
Is a simple web of lies that was designed to make you soundproof
That's exactly why I scream like all the proud do
And slam against the gates with my music until I plow through
I see the smiles and your frowns
And you feel like everything in your life is nailed to the ground
I see you speak with the same distaste in your mouth
While everything breaks you down to the bottle trying to drown yourself
I guess there's no hope left
All the ships are leaving port and the wine is smelling like death
You can smoke it 'til there's holes in your chest
'Til you're breathing out your last cold breath
I wish I could've told you

[Hook: Grieves]

All your demons, are gonna getcha
And all your demons, are gonna get you
And all your demons, are gonna get you
And all your demons, are gonna get you

[Verse 2: Grieves]

And this [?] is full of them
From the bar to the booth
Leave the guitar in the corner and stray far from your roots
Never, thanked your father for infecting your youth
With a healthy taste for violence and 150 proof
And, all you ever learned from life, is an ice pack
Is good to stop the swelling and for chilling down your pint glass
Every evening as you open up your night cap
You drink yourself away like it's the only way to fight back
I can show you how I feel and what it does to me
And how I look you in the face and see what has become of me
And, I'm a product of your liquid courage company
That drowned away your sorrows before you knew that they were running free
So, breathe in, and breathe out
Blur the space between us and constrict me when I reach out
And break the mirror so you never have to see out
And know that you were talking to yourself
I wish I could've shown you

[Hook]

[Bridge]

It's the bottom of the bottle
It's the bottom of the bottle

[x10]

(You hit the bottom of the bottle
It's the bottom of the bottle
You hit the bottom of the bottle
It's the bottom of the bottle)[Hook]
I can't breathe... in this place...
I can't breathe... without your face
I can't breathe...
I need you here...

[Verse 1: Grieves]
We're all stars, patterns of circles around the nature
Substitute the journey with our unintended laughter
Detached from society, reality kills
And I should close all the windows while my sanity builds
We all planned to be real, but this what’s left up out the program
Dancing on the avenue with distorted hate and romance
It goes fast, and God will lead the way from hell
Living inside the world created feelings which I see in myself
But it told meet me after darkness, nah
And it told meet me and the end of what I've started
I hold strong gripping the facts of what I've given
Interests bringing my system to the rhythm
I'm swimming, but I don't feel the water all around me
All I hear is waves, crashing and pounding
I'm drowning, slowly I'm sinking into the future
Tide drags back in the past, therefore my views is
When skipping amongst the sewage we're giving the rods
So we're ripping apart the blueprint to living with God
Is its visual introduce me to all of my thoughts
Cause I could swear to y'all I saw it
Visions of happiness inside of object that's molding my dreams
I try to love life passionately holding my means
But it don't show what I see and it don't slow for the speed
And it don't know that it's me, my lips won't roll to the speech
It feels like lost in a world, that we were meant to be a part of
Member in the darkness from my second floor apartment
Like father love me and teach me and lead me with understanding
All I get is silence when I ask it about sadness
It's entrapment, those lackin interaction
Don't consider it lonely cause it has them in their passion
I'm impassioned, so the empty does excite me
It's just the thought of dying alone that's leaving me frightened
It's us

[Hook]
I can't breathe... in this place...
I can't breathe... without your face
I can't breathe... I need you in my place...
I need you... in my place...

[Verse 2: Grieves]
It's over, it has been, laughing at my resistance
You act as if me leaving this place is gon make a difference
I'm living and giving every effort to make this love build
Still I siting silence every morning till the sun fills
The cracks of aluminum shade above my window
I still feel your presence and smell it upon my pillow
So now what? Oh you want to let it go
You want to run into this sun and leave me shovelin snow
I'm not down with the fact that I can't see what lies ahead of me
Every moment closer brings another empty memory
Life is not a lesson if you never let it teach one
Been skipping class for so long that we don't feel we need one
I reach into my feelings, speak em so you can feel em
I leave an open mind too, but I think amongst the reruns
It's sad, ink upon the paper makes it better
Ink is on the paper, sin in every single letter
I'm a rhymer, a lover, another person to others
A thundercloud in the upturn of breaking this off
I try to take it to thought, put it back to what I'm livin in
And I feel like I'm a victim of this circle we spinnin in
Lust trapped around us and we feel it trying to break us
We feel it as it takes to our decisions trying to pray us
To break up, pause button in our relationship
To hold up, maybe I'll be back, but wouldn't wait for it
Game, not okay, it hurts my brain
It breaks my heart and every single thing I'm trying to maintain
But it's the same things breaking me down, making me step up
The same scenes raced in this town that makes me fed up
It hurts, and honestly I have to let you know this
And I don't give a damn if people laugh at me for showin it
It's real. It's a part of me that's part of you
It's a part of our surroundings and everything we do
It's love. Indescribable by any lyric
Undeniable feelings achieved to words and you seen it
And if you just don't need it right now, you need to tell me
So I can stop wasting my wishes inside this well, we
Fill with change, but it just seems to take the sense out
Ripples of reflection of the vision that we set out
I etch clouds, and try to simulate the purpose
I think about your reasons for leaving and how it hurts us
But helps it. But I don't understand what it is
I know I truly trust you, so I guess I'll cast my chips in
So get it, cross the distances to your happiness
Find the things you need, but never let them block the path you skip
I'll never forget you, I know you'll never forget me
I guess its true, the things you love most you got to set free
Set free, set free... Just gotta set it free...
Peace

[Hook]
I can't breathe... in this place...
I can't breathe... without your face
I can't breathe...
I need you here...[Verse 1]
As simple as I am I got a puzzle for a heart
Laid it on the table in the living room
And rummaged through the parts
The child in me is running through the yard
While the man that I'm supposed to be is searching for a breath in the cigar smoke chokin'
Drying out my eyes like the desert wind
Drunk, taking shots at the moon with an empty pen
I got a feeling that once it gets to the end
I'll be buried neck deep in this shit with no friends, go figure
Life's been a freak show
Learn to hold a knife at a young age and bleed slow
Following the keystrokes
Leading to my words
Is a trail most traveled by a part of me
You would label disturbed
But it works
Living with the plague
Marching to the beat of my bones getting thrown into the lake
They sink heavy like a thought made of lead
And fall slowly to the depths
If I could find a better way to make you see what I've been thinking
I would probably just paint a fucking picture
They say it's worth a thousand words

[Hook]
Hold on
There's something in the basement
Chained to the furnace
Underneath the stairs
So close I can taste it
Climbing up the drain pipe
Trying to get a breath of air

Oh god
The only way to face it
Is gonna leave the whole world
Thinking that I'm crazy
So close I can taste it
Trying to find a way to take away my breath of air

[Verse 2]
I carve it all into the clay
Walking monument of my mistakes
Living off the rain checks
Written in the fray
The artist in me wants to play
While the person I'm supposed to be is trying to figure out if I'm okay
A scapegoat with a flamethrower
Burning up the tall grass
Growing like a tumor on his gravestone
I got a feeling if the same old motherfucking shit keeps happening
I'll be dead before this game's over
Great, I'm in dark water and diving
Trying to find peace in the deep I reside in
It keeps finding a better way to remind me
That anywhere I go it'll be right there behind me
Fine with it, pressed to the page
Leaking like a wide open cut from a thrust of the blade
It falls heavy like a bus from a broken bridge
And keeps me watching from the ridge
If I could find a better way to make the jaws of it release me
I would probably just bite my fucking arm off
They say it happens in the wild

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I start shaking when it awakens inside of me
They tried to tell me it was a panic but they lied to me
Got me thinking I was fragile and incompetent
And tried to build a road around that avalanche on top of me
Failed, laying on a bed of rusty nails
Trying to distribute the weight enough to balance out the scales
I lost heaven the second my ship sailed
But survived long enough to tell the tale

[Hook]They all look the same

Capitol Hill boys that look like Capitol Hill girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like Capitol Hill boys

You came home like you were not there
You were not not there
I do not like that sort of thing, not at all
Not at all

Capitol Hill boys that look like Capitol Hill girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like Capitol Hill boys [x2]

You have long hair, and yours is short
But coke is what both of you snort
Your pants are loose, your pants are tight
You both don't eat, and you're both white!

But I can't tell you apart
No, I can't tell you apart

Capitol Hill boys that look like Capitol Hill girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like Capitol Hill boys [x2]

Are you Amy, or David, or Jamie
Or Seamus, or Lacy, or Hazel, or all of the above?

And I can't tell you apart
No, I can't tell you apart

Are you Amy, or David, or Jamie
Or Seamus, or Lacy, or Hazel, or all of the above?

And I can't tell you apart
No, I can't tell you apart

Capitol Hill boys that look like Capitol Hill girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like Capitol Hill boys [x2]

I love them all

Capitol Hill boys that look like girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like boys

The Mexicans call a potato a papa
But you can call me a potata [x2]
Because I'm a potata![Introduction]
Close your eyes
You will see

[Verse 1: Grieves]
Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
I feel weathered, but feel like I've been driving forever
Showin' up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
I've been better, but all things pass
This life is taking everything away but you're provided with your past
So fuck it--I stick to having dreams on the road
But until this dream is done I'm gonna keep my eyes closed
And breathe, breathe when it snows
Breathe when I'm forced to live a life with a person on a phone
Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin'
Leave with the seasons
Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
Cause after the show when the last star shines
I can make this all better when I close my eyes

[Verse 2: Deacon The Villain]
I'm in another zone where troubles gone
Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
A place where life is easy for everybody else
I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
But we don't know it where we don't show it all
For life ain't protocol, under sky, over law

[Verse 3: Natti]
I'm in another space where all the food is good
And there's enough for everybody in my neighborhood
Where all the grass is blue, where we don't know 'bout green
Cause money ain't a thing I pinch myself it's not a dream
Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldn't mean a thing

[Hook]
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
You will see

[Verse 4: Geologic]
Between climbing and finding it not worth it
Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
I'm so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
I think of home when I close my eyes
So done with the smokes and fries
Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
Drinks I shouldn't drink, things I never write
Cities I never liked now it's like aight
Got merch table weirdos, bros who want to cypher
Girls who want to fuck, but not vice versa
My work is love no complaints I'm fine
Its been a long night can't wait to close my eyes

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
I dream of an industry ego-less
And free from the modern chains with these chains we're so deep in love
Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
Dreaming a publicist wasn't 2 G's a month
And where it's not about numbers and math
And I was content with really just a couple of fans
And my happiness wasn't relying on tours and a van
Merch sales, iTunes, MySpace and a band
With the front, front row stadium packed
And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
And scream at them "Look at me now, look at me man"
Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
Fuck being humble, humility is a step in the past
I woke up and realized it was a dream
Wide awake in the rap game, but life I'm asleep

[Hook]Here I am sittin' on top of the world
With nothin but a bottle of
Gin cause it makes me smile when (ha)
All your little prayers fell
Cause you shoot your words like a torpedo
With the light that shines in front of
You silly little fool of a pawn
You can't control the boat that you're on

It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the weather at all
It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the level you're on

You gotta funny way of begging for help
Screaming at the skylight
Blinded with your fist in the air
Blinded with your fist in the air
And you can't change the world by
Blowing smoke for fate
You stupid little fool of a pawn
You can't control the boat that you're on

It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the weather at all
It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the level you're on

Can't take it away
You can't take it away
I got a point for you all
(na na na na na)
You can't take it away
You can't take it awaaay hey
(ah ahh, na na na na na)

It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the weather at all
It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the level you're on[Intro]

[Verse 1: Grieves]
I guess I'm sick of feeling like I oughta
Pack my bags and go
It's all i've ever known
It's all that keeps me focused
It's all I've ever needed
Was someone to believe in me
When the stars fell outta my skies it wasn't you
And I wish that you could be that one for me but baby it ain't right
That we would fuss and fight until the day turned into night
But still you call me up and tell me how you want to do me just one more time
But I've walked the line and though I'm fine out here alone

[Hook]
It's all my fault then why
You keep calling me up
I keep wondering if it's even worth the trouble we go through
To try to prove
Oh you're gonna be the death of me
Uh huh yeah you're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
You're gonna be the death of me

[Verse 2: Grieves]
I guess I'm sick of feeling like I gotsta
Take one on the chin
Fake your silly whim
Oh it kills me you never notice
Cause all you ever wanted
Was someone to be a part of
Those silly little games you play it wasn't me
And I bet you think if you snap your little fingers I wil run right back to you
But honey that ain't true and it has to prove itself tonight
And if you dont get the simple fact that you and I ain't good together lady you ain't grown
And it's gonna be cold out in that big ol' world alone

[Hook]
It's all my fault then why
You keep calling me up
I keep wondering if it's even worth the trouble we go through
To try to prove
Oh you're gonna be the death of me
Uh huh yeah you're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
You're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
You're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
You're gonna be the death of me
Death of me[Verse 1]
I'll take a breath of that concrete
Step into the jungle with a gleam
And move like it's trynna kill a dream
Cause I don't' have a bone left in me
That'll loan death pity when the grass I'm growin don't green
Ode to the screams
Bouncing off the glass of the storefront window when the reaper walks past
We don't have a grasp on the future
So the past that we're used to
Is all that we ever want back
Running with the axe
Trynna chop the whole world down
Trynna fight your little trip to the ground
Cause you don't wanna see the truth
Of the last breath made when the smooth song plays to the silence of sound
Yeah you will be found
And whether or not you want it to happen
I can guarantee it will go down
SO stop with the fighting
We're all kind of frightened
But I don't see the purpose in trynna cheat death

[Hook]
I'm so sick of this pace
Running around in circles trynna skip his blade
You cannot hide from forever
Inside from the weather
On the day you planned escape
He'll find you down and out, high and dry
Leave you face down dead in your ways
I can't go anywhere
Everywhere that I turn, I see you're all that I know
I know [x2]
Everywhere that you go...
Everywhere that you go...
Everywhere that you go...
Follow...

[Verse 2]
I see it all from perspective
Floating on a dark cloud casted over fear of the view of where death is
Live by the setlist
Never say die with a fist in the air till the world stops spinning and we're breathless
Damn, running from a natural advance that'll end with you lyin where you stand
And I can see the fear in the end of it
But never had ran
Cause never dying doesn't seem to be a plan
SO I live for the moment
Never let the dark cloak change me, or make me be a person that I'm not
Cause if I'm gonna die now
Then I'd rather die proud
For the fact that I went out and gave it everything I got
Name in the rock
Rose on the ground in the grass that'll grow in the soil of my plot
When I laid down to rest
Carving in the stone or a crest
Never cheat life to cheat death

[Hook]
I'm so sick of this pace
Running around in circles trynna skip his blade
You cannot hide from forever
Inside from the weather
On the day you planned escape
He'll find you down and out, high and dry
Leave you face down dead in your ways
I can't go anywhere
Everywhere that I turn, I see you're all that I know
I know [x2]
Everywhere that you go...
Everywhere that you go...
Everywhere that you go...
Follow...[Intro]
Operator here's my dime
Connect me please
I know that she's at home

[Hook: Kno]
It's four o-clock on a Sunday morning
Who the hell is calling my phone?
Waking me up I'm stretching and yawning
If you had any sense you'd leave me alone

[Verse 1: Natti]
Wee hours of the morning and word is bond
I’m in jail I need bail. Again, the word is bond
Not James in a tux with olives draped on my cup
With a dame all on me with healthy letters to cup
So what up?
Can you free me ‘fore my prints get back?
And they run em through the system and realize that I'm black
All I remember was the stripper then I faded to rack
Said her name was December than she sat on my lap
"Merry Crimmuh"
Liquor and higher power my witness
I thought fleeing The People was just a matter of fitness
With all these nice drinks, compliments of Dennis
Whoever the fuck that is
"Dennis is this!"
Two middle fingers up
"Dennis is this!"
Dennis tab maxed out on titties and fifths
Whoever the fuck Dennis, is Dennis is pissed!
Cus I don’t think that dude we was drinking with was Dennis at all, fam!

[Hook: Kno]

[Verse 2: Grieves]
Ha, Yup
Im aware it’s four in the morning
But I just wanna tell you im drunk and im kinda horny
I know it gets annoying, but I been losing my grip
Every woman I talk to I treat like a fair piss and it’s a bitch
Mainly cuz I now consider you one
I wanna let you go, but every time I seem to screw up
Now that’s the problem with the space that you occupy
It’s going great and then the thought of you would cross my mind
A box of wine and a carton of coffin nails will
Convince me now would be a great time for hate mailin’
Like "Hey bitch! How the hell have you been?
Remember me? We were dating and you slept with my friends!"
I just thought that I’d remind you in case you ever forget it
And train yourself to believe that you're not a terrible wretch
Ha
You broke my heart into like a million pieces
So here’s another dim-litted picture of my penis

[Verse 3: Murs]
Whoa!
What the fuck is going on Grieves
You saved my number under the wrong name in your phone?
Is that a picture of your...?
I'ma pretend I didn't see that
All that rain got you suicidal up in Seatt...ohhhhh
You had to much to drink again
Whiskey and a cellphone ain't never gonna be your friend
You booze you lose, homie you been warned
You better off using your cellphone to watch porn
Grab some lotion & a napkin
Jack off then pass out
All these drunk texts'll have you fucked off and ass out
I hope you black out before you do anymore damage
I checked your timeline, homie...why you Tweetin in Spanish?
I understand if this is what you gotta go through
But when you sober up I got some screenshots to show you
Grieves, bro trust me
And you gonna be hella happy that all of them texts didn't go through

[Hook: Kno]

[Outro: Grieves]
Ooh! Ahh!
That's the angle
*click*
She's gonna love that one[Verse 1: Grieves]
And in come the strings
Playing my patience like a note that I never had the guts to sing
I've been living with your lies
Cause my life don't feel quite right unless I'm swelling from the honeybee sting
And look at what you bring me, girl
Nothing but drama, holding on strong to making me feel your woes
How long can we go until we're nothing but a pile of bones?
Stand tall in the cold, right?
You tell me that it's over
And show me what it's like to have a stomach full of sulfur
And loving you has taught me to keep a hand on the holster
In case I gotta shoot a couple holes
But what the hell do I know, huh
Yeah,I don't know shit unless I'm hanging off the curve of your lips
I've been looking for an angel like you since the devil in me
Made it obvious it doesn't exist

[Hook: Grieves + Budo]
How, how will I figure this out?
Under tow dragging you down
Beneath the comforts over that love I gave you drowned
I'm freaking out
Speaking with your name in my mouth
And I don't wanna live without you
I just want to clear your clouds
Away, away, away

[Verse 2: Grieves]
And into the fake smiles
Walking 'round like a stray child
Trying to find a quiet place to sleep
I don't know if you can feel it in the air when you step into the street
But I've been finding it a little hard to breathe
And look at what you brought me, girl
Nothing but pain
Spending my money for a walk in the rain, I'm drained
And never wanted this to be the outcome
When I can never trust you and all I get is "how come?"
Why, after everything I gave you
You can share it with a stranger every time I went away
I've been lied to before girl
I see it in your face that you don't care about the broken heart I taste
But what the hell do I know?
I know the world will go blind if I open up the cage of my mind
I've been running from an angel like you
Since the devil in me showed me heaven's not a bottom line

[Hook: Grieves + Budo]
How, how will I figure this out?
Under tow dragging you down
Beneath the comforts over that love I gave you drowned
I'm freaking out
Speaking with your name in my mouth
And I don't wanna live without you
I just want to clear your clouds
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away

[Hook: Grieves + Budo]
How, how will I figure this out?
Under tow dragging you down
Beneath the comforts over that love I gave you drowned
Speaking with your name in my mouth
And I don't wanna live without you
I just want to clear your clouds
Away, away, away[Grieves]
Say something
Nowadays I'm all ears
Screaming out over the speakers
Breaking eggs with no fear
Made a name as a stranger that painted his pain on a mirror
Stared straight into the eyes of it and faced it for years
Like (ayyyyyyy!) I feel I caved a lot of principles
Emptied a drinking problem in a melting pot of little girls
Like huh, at least I'm honest in my music
Hard to be confident talking 'bout my losses and bruises
But break it down how I know it would never let it control me
Exploded emotions out of my broken soul is important
So, groove with it
I gotta lotta time to brew in it
22 stitches young buck payin' dues, Listen!
I got a itch in my system thats fixin' to stick to the rhythm explicit of when I'm livin''it
With words I can touch the sky in its face, open up wide, let go with the power to fly away, go-

[Hook]
I refuse to stay
In the middle while I sacrifice my fate
Baby I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fly away x2
(yeah yeah)
I hold my culture on the table to see
(eh eh)
Been told that the truth will set you free

Yeah come on, yo

I brought loose of the change just to put a solid fist up
To drip though the distance to whither the prison
Within this I'm alive
And I surprised a couple of people
Been stuck in the slums of the past without a vision to reach to
And thank God for the music
And gettin' addicted to it
For killin' the shit constrictin' me to grip to its uses
I've been down
And thats the single reason that I get up
Its the love of my life the motivation when I get stuck
Stop, and open up your eyes for a second
You wanna see life's limits you should try and dissect it
Never knew about the power that could line a sentence
'till I implied it inside of the part of the mind that invented
Like (microphone screetch)
And I don't need to try to be different
I'm fine with the life that resides inside the bars of the written
Because with words I can touch the sky in its face, open up wide let go with the power to fly away, go-

[Hook]
I refuse to stay
In the middle while I sacrifice my fate
Baby I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fly away x2
(yeah yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah thats right!
HA HA HAIf you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy

[Verse 1: K.Flay]
My daddy was an asshole
At least I think he was, never knew him well enough
He developed quite a habit, bit the dust so a cause to be nuts I got hell of ones
And whether that’s even relevant
Well I don’t know for sure, but I’ve been so disturbed
And I’d like an explanation
For the havoc in my life I’ve been creating
My friend said the reason I’m alone’s I’m a bad girl
Got a knife in my arm
But the scar’s in my bones guess I better with deal with that first
Say, say I what I want when I don’t even know, then apologize after
Seems like the pace of my mistakes keeps accelerating faster
And I find that when the sun has set, I beg for more and more punishment
Getting tough again looking for a cure, some kind of medicine
Like a way fix it, but I’ve found that really nothing can

If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy

[Verse 2: Eligh]
You don't wanna fuck around with my mind
Cuz my mind is a dangerous vine
To find yourself intertwined with or aligned with
Kinda fine but the man is kinda twisted
Is it my fault or is it salt up in the wound
That's been there since the womb
The world is my time gauge
I feel prime rage rise from the rib cage
When I'm feeling jealousies, I hella breathe
To bring a freeze to your bones
And leave you on your knees and all alone
You get the perfect view of the tattoo
On the back of my neck when I lose my love for you
I hover over, love is like a poltergeist
I will haunt your life and make you feel again
I feel the feelings of a mad man and when I can't rant
I leave a mess behind and call the HAZMAT team
I need a vaccine
I'm crazy and I know it
Pass, clean it out, I got some residue
I'm not the perfect man I'm telling you
He's hella cool but he got issues
If you choose to make that move
Make sure you bring some tissues girl
Wish you well on this escapade
I learned my lessons way before today

If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy

[Verse 3: Grieves]
No doubt about it baby I'm a blind mess
With buzzard flying circles over my head
Try to deny for a minute that I said
It's a above me waiting patiently for my death
Bet your shrink would have a field day with me
Blame it on abandonment issues
Or something tragic that happened when I was sixteen
Close the door, stop poking around
Float fine in the waters where the hopeless drown
So stop fishing, all your gonna get is just a sunken boot
A bunch of garbage I discarded from my troubled youth
Heavy tension then there's something I suggest you walk away from before it tries to get you too
Young thing felt love would make a valiant stand
Put a calm in my life with a valium can
A grown man with a stone in his hand
Is not built for a glass-hearted delicate land

If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
If you wanna be my baby, get ready for some bullshit
Cause I’m like fucking crazy, fucking crazy
