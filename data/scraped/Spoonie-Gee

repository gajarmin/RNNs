You say
One for the treble
Two for the time
Come on, y'all, let's rock the -

( *whistle* )

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Funky beats, y'all
Then you rock 'n roll
Then you roll 'n rock
And they you rockin to the beat that just don't want you to stop
Cause I'm the S to the p-double o-n-y
The one MC who you can't deny
Cause I'm the baby-maker, I'm the woman-taker
I'm the cold-crushin lover, the heartbreaker
So come on, fly girls, and please don't stop
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, wanna hit the top
And young ladies, rock on

Say I was drivin down the street on a stormy night
Say up ahead there was this terrible fright
There was a big fine lady, she was crossin the street
She had a box with the disco beat
So I hit my brakes, but they're not all there
I missed the young lady by only a hair
And then I took me a look, I said, "La-di-da-di"
A big fine girl, she had a hell of a body
Then she looked at me and then she started switchin
So I took my key out of the ignition
Got out the car and kept my mouth shut
Cause my 20-20 vision was right on her butt
I caught up with her, I said, "You look so fine
I swear to God I wish you was mine"
She said, "Hey boy, you're Spoonie Gee"
"That's right, honey, how did you know me?"
She said, "Spoonie Gee, you're all the same
And everybody who disco know your name"
I said, "Come on baby, it's not too far
We gonna take a little walk to my car"
Once we got to the car, then we sat in the seat
And then the box was rockin to the funky beat
And then I looked at her and pushed the seat back
Turned off her box and put on my 8-track
And then I started rappin without no pause
Cause my mind was just gettin in those draws
And then I got in the straw, we started do it to the beat
And started doin like this, started doin the freak

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Cause I'm a man's threat
And I'm a woman's pet
And I'm known as the mamsel's joy
And I'm a man who fights on the microphone
And who all the people enjoy, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on

Say I was breakin and freakin at a disco place
I met a fine girl, she had a pretty face
And then she took me home, you say, "The very same night?"
The girl was on and she was outta sight
And then I got the girl for three hours straight
But I had to go to work, so I couldn't be late
I said, "Where's your man?" she said, "He's in jail"
I said, "Come on baby, cause you're tellin a tale
Cause if he comes at me and then he wants to fight
See I'mma get the man good and I'mma get him right
See I'mma roll my barrel and keep the bullets still
And when I shoot my shot, I'm gonna shoot to kill
Cause I'm the Spoonie-Spoon, I don't mess around
I drop a man where he stand right into the ground
You say from Africa to France, say to Germany
Because you can't get a man tryin to mess with me
Cause I'm a smooth talker, I'm the midnight stalker
I'm the image of the man they call the J.D. Walker
If you're gonna be my girl, just come along
And just clap your hands to my funky song
I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't gamble neither
And most people call me a woman pleaser
Cause I keep their phone numbers on the shelf
I go to make love, and then keep it to myself
So no one's gonna know what I'm doin to you
Not your sister, brother, niece, nor your mother, father too"

And take that y'all
And don't stop
You keep on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
Young ladies rock on
Fly guys
What a big surprise
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, don't take no mess
]From the north, the south, from east or west
Cause everybody knows MC Spoonie Gee's the best
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock, rock, y'all and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot
And then you rock and roll
And then you roll and rock
And then you rock to the beat that just don't wantcha to stop
Cause I'm the S to the p-double o-n-y g
I'm talkin about me, MC Spoonie Gee
Rock on, y'all

Keep on to the shill shot
Rock on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
Don't stop the funky beat till the break of dawn
Young ladies
Young ladies

Cause I'm the cool-crushin lover, goes on to supreme
And when it comes to fine girls I'm like a lovin machine
It comes to makin love, I do the best I can
Cause I'm known from coast to coast as the sixty-minute man
It comes to makin face, I got the macho class
I have all the fly girls shakin their ass
So for all you fly girls who wanna be loved
Check me out, cause I'm the highest above
I'm gonna call you up and give you an invitation
So you can see the way Spoonie Gee rocks the nation
One time, for the mind, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Funky freaks, y'all
Yo go hip - hop - a hip-hip a hop
And then you're rockin to the hip, and then you're rockin the hop
And then you on and on and on and on
The beat don't stop until the freaks are gone
And rock on y'all, and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot

And for you sucker-sucker dudes who commit a crime
You wanna do bad, but don't do the time
I say you wanna be dissed and then you wanna be a crook
You find a old lady, take her pocketbook
And then you steal your mother's borrowed money on the sly
You can run, but you can't hide
When the cops crashed through, your face turned pale
I'mma tell you a little story about the jail
Cause see, in jail there's a game and it's called survival
And they run it down to you on your first arrival
They tell you what you can and cannot do
But if you go to jail, watch yours for a crew
Cause when you go in the shower, he's pullin his meat
And he's lookin at you and say you look real sweet
And at first there was one, now ten walked in
Now how in the hell did you expect to win?
I said you better look alive, not like you take dope
And please my brother, don't drop the soap
And if you get out the bathroom, and you're alive
Just remember only a man can survive
In jail of course, cause when you're doin 15 years
You got no ??????, you just have a warden
????? no ???? a corner
?????

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on to shill shot
Like a lime to a lemon and a lemon to a lime
I keep the funky beat, I say I pass the time
And like lemon and lime and like a lime to a lemon
A MC could attract all the women
Cause I'm Spoonie Gee, and I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
So just clap your hands and just stomp your feet
And just rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
To the funky, funky, funky, funky beat
The beat that makes you get up and pat your feet
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock on, y'all
Till the break of dawn
I say you do the Spank or the Patty Duke
Either one you want, you gotta get up and do
The rock-rock and you don't stop
I say I jumped the turnstyle for summer day
And then I seen the guy, and then I fled away
And then he pulled his gun, but he did not shoot
So come on everybody, let's Patty Duke
Cause I'm livin well, and I'm ready to dance
Come on girl, let me show my romance
I'll let you see the way how I rock the mic
Cause I know damn well that I could rock all night
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on, y'all
You go rock and roll
And then you roll and rock..[ All ]
We rock, and don't stop
Well, it's the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
With no strings attached, no bags of tricks
This is the way we get our kicks

[ Treacherous Three ]

[ Special K ]
I'm Special K, I'm on display
I rock across the USA
[ L.A. Sunshine ]
L.A. Sunshine, I rock your mind

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
Remember me, MC Moe Dee

Young ladies fight without a doubt
[ All ]

And if you don't believe us
You should check out how we rock for you
And if you don't believe us
You should check out how we rock for you

[ All ]
DO IT!

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Moe Dee, you got a lotta class
Well, rock a rhyme and make it fast

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
The super scooper, party trooper
Man with all the super-duper
Disco breaks, have what it takes
A man who never makes mistakes
A rapping lord, I'm not a bore
The baddest man you ever saw
The money-making, earth-quaking
Man who gets the party shaking

[ Special K ]
Undefeated, never beated
Never cheated, but succeeded
If I need it, you believe that
Rhymes are guaranteed
Wheeling, dealing, women-stealing
Casanova booty-feeling
Understanding, reprimanding
Rocking, knowing that's demanding

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
No complication, stimulation
Man who's gonna rock the nation
Lime rhyme, battle time
My opponent, he's all mine
I'm not the baddest, not the maddest
When I'm win I am the gladdest
No beginner, not a sinner
On the mike I'm just too bad

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, I'm always clean, I'm not too mean
The baddest man you ever seen
The finger-popping, non-stopping
Man who gets the party rocking
I'm so vicious and bodacious
To the young, cause I'm delicious
Good loving I always make
I always do with no mistake

[ Kool Moe Deee ]
And I'm very, very, very, very
And my favorite flavor's cherry
Oh my God, it's fame and glory
But I never tell a story
The only time I'm on a mike
Because it's something that I like
To be assured the rhymes are lure
I always keep some sets in store

[ Special K ]
The bad, bad, superbad
Never sad, always glad
Not a day you find him mad
Ain't nothing I never had
Sleek, sleek, so unique
Guaranteed to move your feet
So every time I play the beat
Ladies get up off their seat

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The wheeling, stealing, double-dealing
Man who rocks it on a feeling
Give you more of rhymes galore
I shoot my shot, I always score
Girls on my jock and on the lock
The man who rock around the clock
I never date, I never wait
The man who set the people straight

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well I'm Spoonie Gee, as you could see
I rock the whole society
I always rock, as you can tell
I rock with all the clientele
Finesse is do you know I will
I keep the people staring still
Eyes swollen, rhymes tolling
Coming out this microphone

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
Remember me, MC Moe Dee
The man that's at the t-o-p
A ladies dream the way it seem
When they see me, their eyes are gleaming
I'm so shocking when I'm rocking
Bound to get your fingers popping
Have no doubt, I turn it out
Cause that's a party's all about

[ Special K ]
Equal sharing, always caring
Man who rhymes with all the daring
Satisfaction guaranteed
Giving you just what you need
I'm Special K with all the planning
Known to be the most outstanding
When I look into the mirror
Knowing there's no one sincere-er

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
A ???, that'll do it
I don't need some disco fluid
Ball-playing, girl-laying
On the mic I'm rhyme-saying
MC who rock viciously
Satisfaction guaranteed
Or you'll get your money back
Believe me, girl, it's not the wack

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, I'm indeed the one that leave
With any girl I wish to see
That make her smile and never frown
Cause I'm the man who get on down
Have everybody feel they face
And give their tongue a taste
Don't try to make em scream and shout
Just show em what it's all about

[ All ]
Treacherous Three as you can see
[ Special K ]
Special K
[ L.A. Sunshine ]
Sunshine
[ Kool Moe Dee ]
And Kool Moe Dee
[ Spoonie Gee ]
And don't forget MC Spoonie Gee

[ Special K ]
For MC's who bite
The fast-talking rhymes
They're gonna feast
So get ready to eat
Moe Dee's the originator
So you might as well starve
Cause you can't catch this fast beat
(Hit it, Moe)

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
Hey, diddle-diddle on the fiddle
Cause the cat is in the middle
Will he rhyme or will he riddle
Does he want a tender victual
Have a lot, may be a little
Low cause he can feel his middle
And an ocean full of lotion
Cause it's like his magic potion
But my notion's that the potion
Work itself up like a motion
When you're catching Superman
And you don't seem to understand
Instead of high he's in the aisle
???
But the cat was found missing somewhere on the line
The only thing he hears being deaf because of Kool Moe Dee
??? walkin ??? whether talkin on the street
Whether north or south or east
Whether human or a beast
I'm so full of disco (power)
It ain't a MC that I can't devour
In a hour talking fast and he goes sour
Moe Dee, the disco tower power
So take a deep breath, get a drink of water
Special K, you can say it, but make yours shorter

[ Special K ]
Well, I'm so sincere, just sincere
The baddest MC of the year
Say it low, say it loud
Say it special, say it proud
Taking every year in hell
I weigh the highest on the scale
When I rock I take a bow
Sunshine, come on and show 'em how

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The girl-teasing, woman-pleasing
Take a girl, others freezing
Got the heart to play the part
I'm not too sweet, I'm not too tart
We're rapping to the funky beat
The kids all chowed like us like a treat
So come on then and get a taste
Believe me, girl, it's not a waste

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
The super-rhyming, fascinating
Faster rhyme originating
Number one when I'm creating
Number one with no debating
If you look up on the rating
You will see that you're degrading
And you're only commentating
And that gets to be frustrating

[ Special K ]
Yes, for real, we are the deal
And on the mic we use our skill
The latest greatest, no one hate us
Take us home, we're gold-plated
Rapping raw and never bore
And always keep you on the floor
And rock and roll and take control
And rock until we're grey and old

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The law-abiding, never fighting
Girls around are never hiding
Pain-enduring, love-ensuring
Cool, calm, and most alluring
Constant on the jock
The man who make the party rock
I gratify and satisfy
Girl, just say, just say good-bye

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, I'm letting you know I am a pro
Just give me a mike, I'm on the go
[ Treacherous Three ]
The three MC's that never freeze
That rock you on down to your knees
[ Spoonie Gee ]
Like Earl the Pearl that shocked the world
Spoonie Gee attracts a girl
[ Treacherous Three ]
We're cool and calm and have the charm
Young ladies say we mean no harm
[ Spoonie Gee ]
S-p-o-o-n-y Gee
[ Special K ]
S-p-e-c-i-a-l K
[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The S-u-n-s-h-i-n-e
[ All ]
Moe Dee, all the way, y'all

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
To the South, to the West, to the East, to the North
(Come on, Moe Dee, yeah go off, and go off)
Well, I can shock ya and amaze ya
Then I hit ya, then I daze ya
Either way I'm gonna faze ya
But I never ever praise ya
Cause that is your own behaviour
And of course it's in our favor
And since you're on the jock, you can choose your favorite flavor
If you don't know what's the matter
We can serve ya on a platter
And for your delight, well, we can add a little batter
To the south, to the west, to the east, to the north
Come on, Special K, and go off, and go off

[ Special K ]
Cause we're a top organization
And we're here to rock the nation
We need cooperation to perform this devastation
Have you swinging, have you swaying
On the mic, and I'll be saying
No more joking, no more playing
We rock with no delaying
To the South, to the West, to the East, to the North
Come on, Sunshine, go off, go off

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
Say rag-tag, garbage bag
Other MC's know the half
With no permission they all listen
Get their rods and they go fishing
To the bottom of the pod
And bite our rhymes no matter how the party people know we rock
So they can stay all on the jock

[ Special K ]
To the South, to the West, to the East, to the North
Come on, Moe Dee, go off, go off

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
And to the D-a-n-o B
Well, Dano B is at the t-o-p
The Superstar, as you can see
The slicker, quicker, magic tricker
On the mixer there's no one quicker
Any sign of magic tricks
There's no man quicker on the mix
Go by the name of the Superstar
So young ladies (ho!) from near or far
Whether you're high-class or rather bourgeois
Whether you live close, or you live far
Whether bus, by train, or even car
You better come and check out the Superstar
It's Dano B, deejay for me
You say cause my presentation when I'm in the nation
Causes total fascination and a total jubilation
With your cooperation and your participation
Don't give no complication, check out acceleration
Talking faster every second
Other MC's now I reckon
You will wanna bite and chew
Sit back, listen, what you do
Get your pencil, papers and pad
You listen to me like I was your dad
Gonna write the rhymes down to 'Rhymes Galore'
Better tally it up like it was a score
And when it comes to the fly girls, all the things you were taught
You see a pretty young lady, but have second thought
Because her face is on, but her body ain't so hot
Now maybe you should have her, or maybe not
Well, if you rather have a bunch of ??? upon a ???
??? cause she's just a freak
No way that you can reach your peak
On a girl who conversate
And make sure that her head is straight
But when she don't participate
The other girl is not too late
Take it light, because you're blue
Think about it, what you do
Think about it like a man
And someday you will understand
Sex-sex-sex is the law-law-law
When a guy gets a girl on the floor-floor-floor
He sticks his information into her communication
And for further information try the Board of Education
The Army, the Navy, United States Nation
Let's rock, y'all, and don't stop
Ya keep on and shock the house
[ All ]
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
(Spoonie Gee's gonna...)
(Special K's gonna...)
(Moe Dee's gonna...)
(Sunshine's gonna...)

(Easy Lee's gonna...)(Shoop)

(My-my-my girl)

Well, let me tell you 'bout a girl who's finer than fine
She used to be somebody else's, now she's mine
All the fellas said, "Spoonie, don't mess with that"
But it's been a year, and I still go by to see her
It ain't the perfume, well, it's just her
She got the greatest respect for me
She calls me Mr. Gee
And I reply, so fella, hey
No need to try, so you might as well stay away
You spend your money on my girl winin dinin
You're never gettin her back, so ain't no sense in me lyin
To you, what I'ma do? Well, our star did not tell
I took her out one night and I rocked her well
Now she's my girl

Now she's my only girl and you know that's true
But personally it was the right thing to do
To her, cause she was so fine and I was so kind
That when I asked the young lady, she said she didn't mind
Doin what I want, as long as it felt good
Well, you know without a doubt I did the best I could
When I wanted to leave, she wouldn't let me out
For some unknown reason told her friends all about
Me, she even said I was the best she had
But it could not be, if you didn't treat her bad-
Ly now you pretend that you love her so
Tell my friends that you want the girl back, but no
Way, gave her diamonds, I gave her pearls
And not to mention that I gave her my love
And that's why she's my girl

Now I'm the type of guy to make a girl feel good
And in return the young lady does the same, well should-
N't she? One hand washes the other, both wash the face
And as a matter of fact she's tas-
Ty, keeps my feelin like I never did before
My favorite words to the girl is 'more
Please', keeps me smilin, she keeps me feelin
Man, so good, if I was sick, she'd be my healin
My friend, my girl, soon to be my wife
And then she'll be mine for a life-
Time, for now she's my girl

Now sometimes we fuss, sometimes we fight
But we make everything alright before night-
Time, no fussin, no time for fightin
There's plenty good lovin, she's so excitin
She's got me doin things that I never did
Like flushin that stuff like a little kid
But no bedtime stories like Jack & Jill
Takes two to get a pail of water, be for real
If I climb any mountain, it'll be for fun
Not in order to get water, cause to me that's dumb
Without a stop I reach the top, and I won't fall down
Only to get busy if a girl's around
Now that I told you all about my girl
As you can see MC Spoonie Gee's the only one can do it
You say 'what?' well, I say satisfy
That pretty young lady, if you don't believe me try
It, with my girl[ VERSE 1 ]
Now you called my house and you said "come over"
Your mother and your father are gone, and you're alone with Rover
Your dog, but now you're frontin
You said if I come you'd give me somethin
So don't start playin around, cause I'm serious
Girl, what did you call me for, cause I'm curious
Now did you call me just to look in my face
Now I know I ain't come just to take up space
Because the night is right, and the stars are bright
So come on, soul sister, why don't you do right
And just take if off, I mean everything
Hurry up, pretty mama, so that we can swing
Now I don't smoke, and I don't get high
But if I say I don't love, well, that would be a lie
Cause I do every chance I get
But if I don't, I won't fall, I won't fret
Cause I'm no fool, I got plenty of sense
So I'll just be cool and have patience
So when you make up your mind, please let me know
Cause when you give me the green, that's when i'll go
So please, pretty mama, don't hesitate
And entice me nice and cooperate
Now you tried the rest, now try the best
But when time come, girls, don't you fess
And just take it off, and I mean it all
Cause I'm big time, baby, and I ain't small
Now undo your hair, untie your shoe lace
And after you finished, I want you to face
Me, now baby, don't get scared
Cause I'm not like the other guys, so don't compare
Me, tender loving care's all I give
And if possible, girl, well, I would like to live
With you, but if I do it ain't everybody's business
Secretly is just how we got into this
So take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
And like ??? baby, until the last drop
Cruisin down the street in my SL
When I peeped this girl who was built very well
Her face was beautiful, body was fine
Well, how did I know? Cause I was cruisin behind
Her, looked at my car, looked at me
Then she asked me my name, I told the girl Spoonie Gee
But I didn't wanna out-play my hand
So I talked so that she could understand
Me, she was definitely the move
I only said sweet things that would soothe
Her, opened up the door, and she got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told her: "Take it off!"

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now I met this girl at Amusement Park
She was good to go and it was after dark
But you can guess, fellas, what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time
Baby, instead the girl asked me my sign
And I said, "Why?" and she said, "Never mind"
Cause when the time comin it's you I'm thinkin of
A sign will make a difference on how you make love
To me you make me feel so good as a man
Ooh baby, you're sweet as cotton can-
-dy, if I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and you'd be my wife
So let's take a ride through the tunnel of love
Because you know what I'm thinkin of
Come on, baby, just take it off

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I met this girl on the French Riviera
She said, "Spoonie Gee, I'm gonna go wherever
You go, when you're on tour or when you're chillin
Cause if you're able, Spoonie Gee, I'm willin"
I said, "Pretty mama, that's okay with me
So pass a glass and we'll sip Chablis
And in a half hour you'll be emblissed
When I give you a big french kiss
And then you wanna take it off"I'm the godfather... of rap

Well let's get this straight, there's no contest
So now you people know don't have to guess
I'm not tha king of rap, not lord, not prince
I was a young kid rapper that I've been rapping ever since
I was just a young bub, I didn't care what mc's did
Before ??? cause I'm the godfather

I caught silly young ladies, two just chilled
They never said no to me - always say that they will do
Whenever I want them to - when I confront them to
Watch where ya're walkin', or just might browl to
I never rule them, I only school them
But if they ever try to fool me
That's when I foo them
I'm tha godfather

Long time to be chillin', just to make money
I rapped on stage, check my voice for your honey
Cause I'm rappin', and I'm not stoppin'
MC baby, who love stand hip-hopin'
So don't tease me, just kiss me
If ya already had a pimp, ya gonna miss me
I'm just a brother so what's upsaid
Cause it's a pretty ladies, I mean top like this
Ya know I'm the godfather

They say that I'm an mc some say that I'm a proud
I changed my style people just didn't know it yet
I had to tell them I might kill them
You mess with me I'm sick your ass then swell them
Woah like on the phone, I'm 'bout to take charge
At the station for the new car in my garage
They want to cruise me, they don't move me
See my bankroll they want to try to use me
But I'm no fool never losin' my cool
But for me to darkness I make the young ladies drool
I'm not braggin' tellin' you what I'm about
Young ladies no babies and marriage bout
But if you insist you can't convince your house are mine
Night or day we'll be fine
So let's get with it, so that I can't hit it
After an hour or two me and you can just quit it

I'm the godfather

There's no need to be smokin' when the fire is out
So take your hand off your hip and let's work out
No leanin' on the wall no standin' around
So are you ready (for what ?!) for the beat in me now
Because people can't see me so people want to be me
Pretty young ladies want L Blue Spoon
The beat so fair so ate 9 o'clock in the morning
If they're playin' they'll call the cops cause I'm the godfather

I'm the godfather

You got rockin' beat no stoppin' beat
Some roars have things pumpin' beat
All the rest of my time Jerry knows my side
I'm so dip that's why I keep all girls in your mind
I'm not dedicate this at the top of this
Say cool you bring, don't break the rules if you wanna get this
Respect me brother rapper recorded on the show
Ya could stare, cause I don't care it's just long you know

I'm the godfather

Now you be jumpin' your heart will be thumpin
Intendin' rappin', swearin' hip hopin'
Off your face, all know the place
Easely scatty standin' in pace
Don't stand around, your face road in my clan
This is the season no prisonner can't get down
So get all the world, let's up these words
Boogie down to the beat just give it to y'all
No need to get hot money dispenser
You can't have a good time cause it's so danger

I'm the godfather...of rap(Mighty mighty)

Now
I'm gonna tell you a little story 'bout a man I like
He goes by the name of Mighty Mike
Tyson is his name, boxing is his game
Well, he's the greatest, goin straight to the Hall of Fame
He don't float like a butterfly or sting like a bee
But he's the hardest damn puncher you'll ever see
He don't stick and move, he don't weave and bob
But there ain't a heavyweight that can do his job
He do damage to your body, do work on your head
You wind up flat on your back like the canvas was your bed
Well, you can dance around, or you can go toe to toe
But if you fight Mighty Mike, he's gonna lay you low

Mighty Mike
(Mighty mighty)

Well, he's the king of the ring, knows how to do that thing
And he'll knock your butt out just like it ain't no thing
He'll pop you, stop you, then he'll drop you
You wanna know who's gonna win? Sure not you
Well I'm takin bets, 10 and above
I haven't lost a bet yet ever since I discovered

Mighty Mike
(Mighty mighty)

Now my friends keep tellin me, my girl keeps jealin me
She seen Mike fight and got excited, then fell on me
Now I don't know what it is, but maybe you do
When Mike fights, it's just like voodoo
No matter what you do, you'll always lose
I'm not the preacher, but I've got some good news
About Mike

(Mighty mighty)
Mighty Mike

(Ladies and gentlemen
The undefeated
Undisputed
Heavyweight
Champion of the world
Iron Mike Tyson)

He's very soft spoken, but the man hits hard
Don't sleep on him and don't drop your guard

Cause he'll pop you, stop you, then he'll drop you
You wanna know who's gonna win? Sure not you
Well, I'm takin bets 10 and above
I haven't lost a bet yet ever since I discovered

Mighty Mike
(Mighty might)

Go put your best dress on, girl, and look real pretty
Tonight Mike's fightin at Atlantic City
Got my white Tux on, chauffeur's outside
A Caddy stretch limo's gonna be our ride
When we get to the fight, well, we won't be beat
As we watch Mike fight from the front row seats
Now I can't look into the future, I can't tell how long
The fight will go, but this I know, and I won't be wrong
When the bell rings and the deal goes down
Mighty Mike will still be wearin his champion's crown
He's Mighty MikeKick it for me one time, Ted

Now that's it

I like that

(Give it up)
Just kick it

Yeah

Now alright

(Give it up)
Do it

Now I'm 'bout to do my thing

Are you ready?
(Give it up)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Now my girl ain't callin, yet she ain't fallin
I went to the park with the boys and was ballin
And on the bench some other fellas was chillin
Puffin and smokin and tootin and illin
She breaks my heart and tears it all apart, it
Makes me so mad, I feel like startin
A fight, I want her bad, I need her so much
I'm in love, and I'm all shook up
She says she wants to keep me
But yet she's tryin to cheat me
Whatever I had, the girl's always tryin to beat me
I bought whatever, I checked or cashed
The truth of the matter is we just won't last
But I'll keep on trying, and this I'm not denyin
Cause I love you girl just that much, and I ain't lyin
Y'all
She's my honey, my sweet butter cup
I'm in love - and I'm all shook up
Hm-hm

Hm-hm

(Give it up)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now she's not a abused child, but sometimes she can be wild
She wears the best when she dress and has a Colgate smile
A sexy kinda lady, got skin just like a baby
She'll be my wife for life, no if's, no but's or maybe
Top-notch stuff, how dare you call my bluff?
She'll astound, to come down you need a cigarette to puff
She looks so good, well, all I know is she makes me
Feel so good, it's like heaven she takes me
Don't know what I'ma do, but I'ma get it done
She's got me so mad, cause she keeps me on the run
She has an attitude, she can be nice when she wanna
But you can bet your bottom-dollar this girl ain't gonna
Make me or break me, she might shake me
But all she do is just make me
Mad, she wants to boss me, and yet she cost me
But in the end she'll say that she lost me
Which is a lie, but I love her really
Like a snake, ooh, the girl is deadly
But she's my honey, my sweet buttercup
I'm in love - and I'm all shook up

I'm all shook up
Hm-hm

(Give it up)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I wanna knock on wood
Cause lately she's been good
And she's been doin all the things that one day I wish she would
She gets up in the mornin, she fix my food
She walks around the house in the naughty nude
But it's too late, that girl I couldn't take
Cause I was for real, and she just was fake
But she's my honey. my sweet butter cup
I'm in love - and I'm all shook up
Hm-hm

Oh yeah
Hm-hmm

(Give it up)
Kick it, Ted

(Give it up)
Now that's it

Ooh, feels so good
(Give it up)

(Give it up)
Yeah, I like that

Yo, change it up a little bit
Change it up a little bit

Yeah

Now that's what I'm talkin 'bout

Gettin funky

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Moe Dee, you got a lotta class
Well, rock a rhyme and make it fast

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
The super scooper, party trooper
Man with all the super-duper
Disco breaks, have what it takes
A man who never makes mistakes
A rapping lord, I'm not a bore
The baddest man you ever saw
The money-making, earth-quaking
Man who gets the party shaking

[ Special K ]
Undefeated, never beated
Never cheated, but succeeded
If I need it, you believe that
Rhymes are guaranteed
Wheeling, dealing, women-stealing
Casanova booty-feeling
Understanding, reprimanding
Rocking, knowing that's demanding

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
No complication, stimulation
Man who's gonna rock the nation
Lime rhyme, battle time
My opponent, he's all mine
I'm not the baddest, not the maddest
When I'm win I am the gladdest
No beginner, not a sinner
On the mike I'm just too bad

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, I'm always clean, I'm not too mean
The baddest man you ever seen
The finger-popping, non-stopping
Man who gets the party rocking
I'm so vicious and bodacious
To the young, cause I'm delicious
Good loving I always make
I always do with no mistake

[ Kool Moe Deee ]
And I'm very, very, very, very
And my favorite flavor's cherry
Oh my God, it's fame and glory
But I never tell a story
The only time I'm on a mike
Because it's something that I like
To be assured the rhymes are lure
I always keep some sets in store

[ Special K ]
The bad, bad, superbad
Never sad, always glad
Not a day you find him mad
Ain't nothing I never had
Sleek, sleek, so unique
Guaranteed to move your feet
So every time I play the beat
Ladies get up off their seat

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The wheeling, stealing, double-dealing
Man who rocks it on a feeling
Give you more of rhymes galore
I shoot my shot, I always score
Girls on my jock and on the lock
The man who rock around the clock
I never date, I never wait
The man who set the people straight

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well I'm Spoonie Gee, as you could see
I rock the whole society
I always rock, as you can tell
I rock with all the clientele
Finesse is do you know I will
I keep the people staring still
Eyes swollen, rhymes tolling
Coming out this microphone

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
Remember me, MC Moe Dee
The man that's at the t-o-p
A ladies dream the way it seem
When they see me, their eyes are gleaming
I'm so shocking when I'm rocking
Bound to get your fingers popping
Have no doubt, I turn it out
Cause that's a party's all about

[ Special K ]
Equal sharing, always caring
Man who rhymes with all the daring
Satisfaction guaranteed
Giving you just what you need
I'm Special K with all the planning
Known to be the most outstanding
When I look into the mirror
Knowing there's no one sincere-er

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
A ???, that'll do it
I don't need some disco fluid
Ball-playing, girl-laying
On the mic I'm rhyme-saying
MC who rock viciously
Satisfaction guaranteed
Or you'll get your money back
Believe me, girl, it's not the wack

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, I'm indeed the one that leave
With any girl I wish to see
That make her smile and never frown
Cause I'm the man who get on down
Have everybody feel they face
And give their tongue a taste
Don't try to make em scream and shout
Just show em what it's all about

[ All ]
Treacherous Three as you can see
[ Special K ]
Special K
[ L.A. Sunshine ]
Sunshine
[ Kool Moe Dee ]
And Kool Moe Dee
[ Spoonie Gee ]
And don't forget MC Spoonie Gee

[ Special K ]
For MC's who bite
The fast-talking rhymes
They're gonna feast
So get ready to eat
Moe Dee's the originator
So you might as well starve
Cause you can't catch this fast beat
(Hit it, Moe)

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
Hey, diddle-diddle on the fiddle
Cause the cat is in the middle
Will he rhyme or will he riddle
Does he want a tender victual
Have a lot, may be a little
Low cause he can feel his middle
And an ocean full of lotion
Cause it's like his magic potion
But my notion's that the potion
Work itself up like a motion
When you're catching Superman
And you don't seem to understand
Instead of high he's in the aisle
???
But the cat was found missing somewhere on the line
The only thing he hears being deaf because of Kool Moe Dee
??? walkin ??? whether talkin on the street
Whether north or south or east
Whether human or a beast
I'm so full of disco (power)
It ain't a MC that I can't devour
In a hour talking fast and he goes sour
Moe Dee, the disco tower power
So take a deep breath, get a drink of water
Special K, you can say it, but make yours shorter

[ Special K ]
Well, I'm so sincere, just sincere
The baddest MC of the year
Say it low, say it loud
Say it special, say it proud
Taking every year in hell
I weigh the highest on the scale
When I rock I take a bow
Sunshine, come on and show 'em how

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The girl-teasing, woman-pleasing
Take a girl, others freezing
Got the heart to play the part
I'm not too sweet, I'm not too tart
We're rapping to the funky beat
The kids all chowed like us like a treat
So come on then and get a taste
Believe me, girl, it's not a waste

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
The super-rhyming, fascinating
Faster rhyme originating
Number one when I'm creating
Number one with no debating
If you look up on the rating
You will see that you're degrading
And you're only commentating
And that gets to be frustrating

[ Special K ]
Yes, for real, we are the deal
And on the mic we use our skill
The latest greatest, no one hate us
Take us home, we're gold-plated
Rapping raw and never bore
And always keep you on the floor
And rock and roll and take control
And rock until we're grey and old

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The law-abiding, never fighting
Girls around are never hiding
Pain-enduring, love-ensuring
Cool, calm, and most alluring
Constant on the jock
The man who make the party rock
I gratify and satisfy
Girl, just say, just say good-bye

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, I'm letting you know I am a pro
Just give me a mike, I'm on the go
[ Treacherous Three ]
The three MC's that never freeze
That rock you on down to your knees
[ Spoonie Gee ]
Like Earl the Pearl that shocked the world
Spoonie Gee attracts a girl
[ Treacherous Three ]
We're cool and calm and have the charm
Young ladies say we mean no harm
[ Spoonie Gee ]
S-p-o-o-n-y Gee
[ Special K ]
S-p-e-c-i-a-l K
[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The S-u-n-s-h-i-n-e
[ All ]
Moe Dee, all the way, y'all

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
To the South, to the West, to the East, to the North
(Come on, Moe Dee, yeah go off, and go off)
Well, I can shock ya and amaze ya
Then I hit ya, then I daze ya
Either way I'm gonna faze ya
But I never ever praise ya
Cause that is your own behaviour
And of course it's in our favor
And since you're on the jock, you can choose your favorite flavor
If you don't know what's the matter
We can serve ya on a platter
And for your delight, well, we can add a little batter
To the south, to the west, to the east, to the north
Come on, Special K, and go off, and go off

[ Special K ]
Cause we're a top organization
And we're here to rock the nation
We need cooperation to perform this devastation
Have you swinging, have you swaying
On the mic, and I'll be saying
No more joking, no more playing
We rock with no delaying
To the South, to the West, to the East, to the North
Come on, Sunshine, go off, go off

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
Say rag-tag, garbage bag
Other MC's know the half
With no permission they all listen
Get their rods and they go fishing
To the bottom of the pod
And bite our rhymes no matter how the party people know we rock
So they can stay all on the jock

[ Special K ]
To the South, to the West, to the East, to the North
Come on, Moe Dee, go off, go off

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
And to the D-a-n-o B
Well, Dano B is at the t-o-p
The Superstar, as you can see
The slicker, quicker, magic tricker
On the mixer there's no one quicker
Any sign of magic tricks
There's no man quicker on the mix
Go by the name of the Superstar
So young ladies (ho!) from near or far
Whether you're high-class or rather bourgeois
Whether you live close, or you live far
Whether bus, by train, or even car
You better come and check out the Superstar
It's Dano B, deejay for me
You say cause my presentation when I'm in the nation
Causes total fascination and a total jubilation
With your cooperation and your participation
Don't give no complication, check out acceleration
Talking faster every second
Other MC's now I reckon
You will wanna bite and chew
Sit back, listen, what you do
Get your pencil, papers and pad
You listen to me like I was your dad
Gonna write the rhymes down to 'Rhymes Galore'
Better tally it up like it was a score
And when it comes to the fly girls, all the things you were taught
You see a pretty young lady, but have second thought
Because her face is on, but her body ain't so hot
Now maybe you should have her, or maybe not
Well, if you rather have a bunch of ??? upon a ???
??? cause she's just a freak
No way that you can reach your peak
On a girl who conversate
And make sure that her head is straight
But when she don't participate
The other girl is not too late
Take it light, because you're blue
Think about it, what you do
Think about it like a man
And someday you will understand
Sex-sex-sex is the law-law-law
When a guy gets a girl on the floor-floor-floor
He sticks his information into her communication
And for further information try the Board of Education
The Army, the Navy, United States Nation
Let's rock, y'all, and don't stop
Ya keep on and shock the house
[ All ]
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop

So come on, fly girls, and please don't stop
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, wanna hit the top
And young ladies, rock on

Say I was drivin down the street on a stormy night
Say up ahead there was this terrible fright
There was a big fine lady, she was crossin the street
She had a box with the disco beat
So I hit my brakes, but they're not all there
I missed the young lady by only a hair
And then I took me a look, I said, "La-di-da-di"
A big fine girl, she had a hell of a body
Then she looked at me and then she started switchin
So I took my key out of the ignition
Got out the car and kept my mouth shut
Cause my 20-20 vision was right on her butt
I caught up with her, I said, "You look so fine
I swear to God I wish you was mine"
She said, "Hey boy, you're Spoonie Gee"
"That's right, honey, how did you know me?"
She said, "Spoonie Gee, you're all the same
And everybody who disco know your name"
I said, "Come on baby, it's not too far
We gonna take a little walk to my car"
Once we got to the car, then we sat in the seat
And then the box was rockin to the funky beat
And then I looked at her and pushed the seat back
Turned off her box and put on my 8-track
And then I started rappin without no pause
Cause my mind was just gettin in those draws
And then I got in the straw, we started do it to the beat
And started doin like this, started doin the freak

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Cause I'm a man's threat

And I'm a man who fights on the microphone
And who all the people enjoy, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on

Say I was breakin and freakin at a disco place
I met a fine girl, she had a pretty face
And then she took me home, you say, "The very same night?"
The girl was on and she was outta sight
And then I got the girl for three hours straight
But I had to go to work, so I couldn't be late
I said, "Where's your man?" she said, "He's in jail"
I said, "Come on baby, cause you're tellin a tale
Cause if he comes at me and then he wants to fight
See I'mma get the man good and I'mma get him right
See I'mma roll my barrel and keep the bullets still
And when I shoot my shot, I'm gonna shoot to kill
Cause I'm the Spoonie-Spoon, I don't mess around
I drop a man where he stand right into the ground
You say from Africa to France, say to Germany
Because you can't get a man tryin to mess with me
Cause I'm a smooth talker, I'm the midnight stalker
I'm the image of the man they call the J.D. Walker
If you're gonna be my girl, just come along
And just clap your hands to my funky song
I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't gamble neither
And most people call me a woman pleaser
Cause I keep their phone numbers on the shelf
I go to make love, and then keep it to myself
So no one's gonna know what I'm doin to you
Not your sister, brother, niece, nor your mother, father too"

And take that y'all
And don't stop
You keep on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn

And for you sucker-sucker dudes who commit a crime
You wanna do bad, but don't do the time
I say you wanna be dissed and then you wanna be a crook
You find a old lady, take her pocketbook
And then you steal your mother's borrowed money on the sly
You can run, but you can't hide
When the cops crashed through, your face turned pale
I'mma tell you a little story about the jail
Cause see, in jail there's a game and it's called survival
And they run it down to you on your first arrival
They tell you what you can and cannot do
But if you go to jail, watch yours for a crew
Cause when you go in the shower, he's pullin his meat
And he's lookin at you and say you look real sweet
And at first there was one, now ten walked in
Now how in the hell did you expect to win?
I said you better look alive, not like you take dope
And please my brother, don't drop the soap
And if you get out the bathroom, and you're alive
Just remember only a man can survive
In jail of course, cause when you're doin 15 years
You got no ??????, you just have a warden
????? no ???? a corner
?????

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on to shill shot
Like a lime to a lemon and a lemon to a lime

A MC could attract all the women
Cause I'm Spoonie Gee, and I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all

And just rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
To the funky, funky, funky, funky beat
The beat that makes you get up and pat your feet
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock on, y'all
Till the break of dawn
I say you do the Spank or the Patty Duke
Either one you want, you gotta get up and do
The rock-rock and you don't stop
I say I jumped the turnstyle for summer day
And then I seen the guy, and then I fled away
And then he pulled his gun, but he did not shoot
So come on everybody, let's Patty Duke
Cause I'm livin well, and I'm ready to dance
Come on girl, let me show my romance
I'll let you see the way how I rock the mic
Cause I know damn well that I could rock all night
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on, y'all
You go rock and roll
And then you roll and rock..[ VERSE 1 ]
Now you called my house and you said "come over"
Your mother and your father are gone, and you're alone with Rover
Your dog, but now you're frontin
You said if I come you'd give me somethin
So don't start playin around, cause I'm serious
Girl, what did you call me for, cause I'm curious
Now did you call me just to look in my face
Now I know I ain't come just to take up space
Because the night is right, and the stars are bright
So come on, soul sister, why don't you do right
And just take if off, I mean everything
Hurry up, pretty mama, so that we can swing
Now I don't smoke, and I don't get high
But if I say I don't love, well, that would be a lie
Cause I do every chance I get
But if I don't, I won't fall, I won't fret
Cause I'm no fool, I got plenty of sense
So I'll just be cool and have patience
So when you make up your mind, please let me know
Cause when you give me the green, that's when i'll go
So please, pretty mama, don't hesitate
And entice me nice and cooperate
Now you tried the rest, now try the best
But when time come, girls, don't you fess
And just take it off, and I mean it all
Cause I'm big time, baby, and I ain't small
Now undo your hair, untie your shoe lace
And after you finished, I want you to face
Me, now baby, don't get scared
Cause I'm not like the other guys, so don't compare
Me, tender loving care's all I give
And if possible, girl, well, I would like to live
With you, but if I do it ain't everybody's business
Secretly is just how we got into this
So take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
And like ??? baby, until the last drop
Cruisin down the street in my SL
When I peeped this girl who was built very well
Her face was beautiful, body was fine
Well, how did I know? Cause I was cruisin behind
Her, looked at my car, looked at me
Then she asked me my name, I told the girl Spoonie Gee
But I didn't wanna out-play my hand
So I talked so that she could understand
Me, she was definitely the move
I only said sweet things that would soothe
Her, opened up the door, and she got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told her: "Take it off!"

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now I met this girl at Amusement Park
She was good to go and it was after dark
But you can guess, fellas, what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time
Baby, instead the girl asked me my sign
And I said, "Why?" and she said, "Never mind"
Cause when the time comin it's you I'm thinkin of
A sign will make a difference on how you make love
To me you make me feel so good as a man
Ooh baby, you're sweet as cotton can-
-dy, if I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and you'd be my wife
So let's take a ride through the tunnel of love
Because you know what I'm thinkin of
Come on, baby, just take it off

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I met this girl on the French Riviera
She said, "Spoonie Gee, I'm gonna go wherever
You go, when you're on tour or when you're chillin
Cause if you're able, Spoonie Gee, I'm willin"
I said, "Pretty mama, that's okay with me
So pass a glass and we'll sip Chablis
And in a half hour you'll be emblissed
When I give you a big french kiss
And then you wanna take it off"Party

(Did you come to party?)
(Did you come to party-party?)
(Did you come to party?)
(Did you)			(2x)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Well, the time is now, and the place is here
You're not ready till you're sweaty down to your underwear
Not sayin it as a joke, just a bit of advice
Cause when I rap you're bout to be, because I'm just that nice
So dig this, when I'm rappin people start clappin
Get on the dancefloor, and things just start happen
I don't know what it is, but I was tryin to guess
Did you come to party or to start some mess?
Now to me, dancin is a hell of a task
Now I've got a question, do you mind if I ask?

(Did you come to party?)  (3x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now it makes no difference if the people start jumpin
On solid ground, cause the music is pumpin
So if you dare, please, be ready to rock
Yes, the music is on just like popcorn
So don't hold back, because the party is packed
And this beat is dope, now did you get that, Jack?
So get with it, don't quit it, you hear my rhyme, forget it
You're tryina be me, Spoonie Gee, just forget it
Cause I'm the only one that can do it this way
When you see me at a party you will always say
"Yeah, that's Spoonie Gee", and your girls say, "Not hardly"
So what's your name, baby, did you come here to party?

(Did you come to party?)
(Did you come to party-party?)  (3x)
(Did you come)

Let's break it down

[ VERSE 3 ]
Here we go now, dance, you're gonna sweat
But be prepared, because we're nowhere finished yet
I'm rockin, and I'm rollin
The mic is in my hand, and I'm the one that's controllin
Are you done? You better quit
And let me rap a little bit
Cause this is a new hit that I'm makin
And other records I'm breakin
So

(Did you come to party?)
(Did you come to party-party)  (3x)

[ VERSE 4 ]
Now the beat is swingin, I'm rappin, not singin
People on the outside just hangin
Around, for what? To hear the Spoonie Gee sound
To move, to have fun, to get on down
Cause I'm serious, I don't have no time for playin
So listen to my music, as well as what I'm sayin
The music is a part, and the words are too
Together they make you do what you came to
You wanna finger-pop? Well, go head, I won't stop you
Put some music in rap, and then rock you
Cause that's what y'all came here for
But if you didn't, there's the door
Well?

(Did you come to party?)
(Did you come to party-party?)  (7x)

This beat is dope  (3x)

Best believe it[Intro]
Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin'

Badself
Yeah

[Hook]
Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin'
Everyone's got to make a livin'

Badself
Hit man
With your badself
Yeah
With your badself
Hit man

[Verse 1]
Not to kick you down, but he's known all over town
Keeps two or three pretty women around
Stuff you pop out your mouth he ain't takin
He got the dudes on the avenue shakin
Livin on the hill he keeps up buildin and will
Please understand, this man can kill at will
One purpose, he know it's a payday - hey
Now I'm not one for talkin, but there he is, the hit man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Always walkin alone in the street through an alley
He has no one he can call old pal of mine
But he's a man, he uses skill
You're the target, aim, shoot, and you better believe he will
If he's heated, so why don't you beat it
You got no car, then brotherman, feet it
Get out the way and hopefully stay
And once you get there, on your knees and pray
Cause you never know you might see him again
And then they'll have to call your next akin
What a way to go, because of what you didn't know
And after all this you may say 'So
What?' What? I'mma tell you somethin, please listen
Once you're gone, ain't nothin you could be missin
But while you're livin, there's a lot to enjoy
Don't play with him, he ain't no toy
There he is: the hit man

[Hook]

You don't understand
Hit man
Take it down

[Verse 3]
Another truck was robbed, they called him for the job
This is his livin, brotherman, not his hobby
Well anyway, he had to stop them
Well, as we say Uptown: just lay or drop them
Hang in the street day and night just because
To get a lead on who it was
He asks one brother, and then another
But in the end only to discover
>From all the different leads he picked up
That it was his best friend who did the stick-up
Thought real deep: I have to put him to sleep
His reputation he had to keep
A very cool brother with funny ways
He chilled on the roof four nights and three days
And it bothered me, so I asked him this
He said, "When I'm high, I don't miss
I'm a hit man"

[Hook]

Cause I'm a hit man

[Verse 4]
A soft-spoken guy, and that's no lie
I know it's hard to believe, so please try
Cause if you underestimate him it'll be doomsday for you
So tell the sister at the church to pray for you
So that you never ever make the mistake
Cause if you do, just remember your life he'll take
On a far journey with no way back
And no mercy, he don't give no slack
Cause he's a hit man

[Hook]

Hit man
He's a hit manKick it for me one time, Ted

Now that's it

I like that

(Give it up)
Just kick it

Yeah

Now alright

(Give it up)
Do it

Now I'm 'bout to do my thing

Are you ready?
(Give it up)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Now my girl ain't callin, yet she ain't fallin
I went to the park with the boys and was ballin
And on the bench some other fellas was chillin
Puffin and smokin and tootin and illin
She breaks my heart and tears it all apart, it
Makes me so mad, I feel like startin
A fight, I want her bad, I need her so much
I'm in love, and I'm all shook up
She says she wants to keep me
But yet she's tryin to cheat me
Whatever I had, the girl's always tryin to beat me
I bought whatever, I checked or cashed
The truth of the matter is we just won't last
But I'll keep on trying, and this I'm not denyin
Cause I love you girl just that much, and I ain't lyin
Y'all
She's my honey, my sweet butter cup
I'm in love - and I'm all shook up
Hm-hm

Hm-hm

(Give it up)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now she's not a abused child, but sometimes she can be wild
She wears the best when she dress and has a Colgate smile
A sexy kinda lady, got skin just like a baby
She'll be my wife for life, no if's, no but's or maybe
Top-notch stuff, how dare you call my bluff?
She'll astound, to come down you need a cigarette to puff
She looks so good, well, all I know is she makes me
Feel so good, it's like heaven she takes me
Don't know what I'ma do, but I'ma get it done
She's got me so mad, cause she keeps me on the run
She has an attitude, she can be nice when she wanna
But you can bet your bottom-dollar this girl ain't gonna
Make me or break me, she might shake me
But all she do is just make me
Mad, she wants to boss me, and yet she cost me
But in the end she'll say that she lost me
Which is a lie, but I love her really
Like a snake, ooh, the girl is deadly
But she's my honey, my sweet buttercup
I'm in love - and I'm all shook up

I'm all shook up
Hm-hm

(Give it up)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I wanna knock on wood
Cause lately she's been good
And she's been doin all the things that one day I wish she would
She gets up in the mornin, she fix my food
She walks around the house in the naughty nude
But it's too late, that girl I couldn't take
Cause I was for real, and she just was fake
But she's my honey. my sweet butter cup
I'm in love - and I'm all shook up
Hm-hm

Oh yeah
Hm-hmm

(Give it up)
Kick it, Ted

(Give it up)
Now that's it

Ooh, feels so good

Yeah, I like that

Yo, change it up a little bit

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Funky beats, y'all
Then you rock 'n roll
Then you roll 'n rock
And they you rockin' to the beat that just don't want you to stop
Cause I'm the s to the p-double o-n-y
The one mc who you can't deny
Cause I'm the baby-maker, I'm the woman-taker
I'm the cold-crushin lover, the heartbreaker
So come on, fly girls, and please don't stop
Cause I'm mc Spoonie gee, wanna hit the top
And young ladies, rock on

Say I was drivin' down the street on a stormy night
Say up ahead there was this terrible fright
There was a big fine lady, she was crossin' the street
She had a box with the disco beat
So I hit my brakes, but they're not all there
I missed the young lady by only a hair
And then I took me a look, I said, "la-di-da-di"
A big fine girl, she had a hell of a body
Then she looked at me and then she started switchin'
So I took my key out of the ignition
Got out the car and kept my mouth shut
Cause my 20-20 vision was right on her butt
I caught up with her, I said, "you look so fine
I swear to god I wish you was mine"
She said, "hey boy, you're Spoonie gee"
"that's right, honey, how did you know me?"
She said, "Spoonie gee, you're all the same
And everybody who disco know your name"
I said, "come on baby, it's not too far
We gonna take a little walk to my car"
Once we got to the car, then we sat in the seat
And then the box was rockin' to the funky beat
And then I looked at her and pushed the seat back
Turned off her box and put on my 8-track
And then I started rappin' without no pause
Cause my mind was just gettin' in those draws
And then I got in the straw, we started do it to the beat
And started doin' like this, started doin' the freak

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Cause I'm MC Spoonie gee, I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Cause I'm a man's threat
And I'm a woman's pet
And I'm known as the mamsel's joy
And I'm a man who fights on the microphone
And who all the people enjoy, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on

Say I was breakin' and freakin' at a disco place
I met a fine girl, she had a pretty face
And then she took me home, you say, "the very same night?"
The girl was on and she was outta sight
And then I got the girl for three hours straight
But I had to go to work, so I couldn't be late
I said, "where's your man?" she said, "he's in jail"
I said, "come on baby, cause you're tellin' a tale
Cause if he comes at me and then he wants to fight
See I'mma get the man good and I'mma get him right
See I'mma roll my barrel and keep the bullets still
And when I shoot my shot, I'm gonna shoot to kill
Cause I'm the Spoonie-spoon, I don't mess around
I drop a man where he stand right into the ground
You say from africa to france, say to germany
Because you can't get a man tryin to mess with me
Cause I'm a smooth talker, I'm the midnight stalker
I'm the image of the man they call the J.D. walker
If you're gonna be my girl, just come along
And just clap your hands to my funky song
I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't gamble neither
And most people call me a woman pleaser
Cause I keep their phone numbers on the shelf
I go to make love, and then keep it to myself
So no one's gonna know what I'm doin' to you
Not your sister, brother, niece, nor your mother, father too"

And take that y'all
And don't stop
You keep on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
Young ladies rock on
Fly guys
What a big surprise
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, don't take no mess
From the north, the south, from east or west
Cause everybody knows MC Spoonie Gee's the best
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock, rock, y'all and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot
And then you rock and roll
And then you roll and rock
And then you rock to the beat that just don't wantcha to stop
Cause I'm the s to the p-double o-n-y g
I'm talkin' about me, MC Spoonie gee
Rock on, y'all

Rock on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
Don't stop the funky beat till the break of dawn
Young ladies
Young ladies

Cause I'm the cool-crushin lover, goes on to supreme
And when it comes to fine girls I'm like a lovin' machine
It comes to makin' love, I do the best I can
Cause I'm known from coast to coast as the sixty-minute man
It comes to makin' face, I got the macho class
I have all the fly girls shakin' their ass
So for all you fly girls who wanna be loved
Check me out, cause I'm the highest above
I'm gonna call you up and give you an invitation
So you can see the way Spoonie Gee rocks the nation
One time, for the mind, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Funky freaks, y'all
Yo go hip hop a hip-hip a hop
And then you're rockin' to the hip, and then you're rockin' the hop
And then you on and on and on and on
The beat don't stop until the freaks are gone
And rock on y'all, and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot

And for you sucker-sucker dudes who commit a crime
You wanna do bad, but don't do the time
I say you wanna be dissed and then you wanna be a crook
You find a old lady, take her pocketbook
And then you steal your mother's borrowed money on the sly
You can run, but you can't hide
When the cops crashed through, your face turned pale
I'mma tell you a little story about the jail
Cause see, in jail there's a game and it's called survival
And they run it down to you on your first arrival
They tell you what you can and cannot do
But if you go to jail, watch yours for a crew
Cause when you go in the shower, he's pullin' his meat
And he's lookin' at you and say you look real sweet
And at first there was one, now ten walked in
Now how in the hell did you expect to win?
I said you better look alive, not like you take dope
And please my brother, don't drop the soap
And if you get out the bathroom, and you're alive
Just remember only a man can survive
In jail of course, cause when you're doin' 15 years
You got no, you just have a warden
No a corner

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on to shill shot
Like a lime to a lemon and a lemon to a lime
I keep the funky beat, I say I pass the time
And like lemon and lime and like a lime to a lemon
A MC could attract all the women
Cause I'm Spoonie Gee, and I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
So just clap your hands and just stomp your feet
And just rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
To the funky, funky, funky, funky beat
The beat that makes you get up and pat your feet
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock on, y'all
Till the break of dawn
I say you do the spank or the patty duke
Either one you want, you gotta get up and do
The rock-rock and you don't stop
I say I jumped the turnstile for summer day
And then I seen the guy, and then I fled away
And then he pulled his gun, but he did not shoot
So come on everybody, let's patty duke
Cause I'm livin' well, and I'm ready to dance
Come on girl, let me show my romance
I'll let you see the way how I rock the mic
Cause I know damn well that I could rock all night
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on, y'all
You go rock and roll
And then you roll and rock(Mighty mighty)

Now
I'm gonna tell you a little story 'bout a man I like
He goes by the name of Mighty Mike
Tyson is his name, boxing is his game
Well, he's the greatest, goin straight to the Hall of Fame
He don't float like a butterfly or sting like a bee
But he's the hardest damn puncher you'll ever see
He don't stick and move, he don't weave and bob
But there ain't a heavyweight that can do his job
He do damage to your body, do work on your head
You wind up flat on your back like the canvas was your bed
Well, you can dance around, or you can go toe to toe
But if you fight Mighty Mike, he's gonna lay you low

Mighty Mike
(Mighty mighty)

Well, he's the king of the ring, knows how to do that thing
And he'll knock your butt out just like it ain't no thing
He'll pop you, stop you, then he'll drop you
You wanna know who's gonna win? Sure not you
Well I'm takin bets, 10 and above
I haven't lost a bet yet ever since I discovered

Mighty Mike
(Mighty mighty)

Now my friends keep tellin me, my girl keeps jealin me
She seen Mike fight and got excited, then fell on me
Now I don't know what it is, but maybe you do
When Mike fights, it's just like voodoo
No matter what you do, you'll always lose
I'm not the preacher, but I've got some good news
About Mike

(Mighty mighty)
Mighty Mike

(Ladies and gentlemen
The undefeated
Undisputed
Heavyweight
Champion of the world
Iron Mike Tyson)

He's very soft spoken, but the man hits hard
Don't sleep on him and don't drop your guard

Cause he'll pop you, stop you, then he'll drop you
You wanna know who's gonna win? Sure not you
Well, I'm takin bets 10 and above
I haven't lost a bet yet ever since I discovered

Mighty Mike
(Mighty might)

Go put your best dress on, girl, and look real pretty
Tonight Mike's fightin at Atlantic City
Got my white Tux on, chauffeur's outside
A Caddy stretch limo's gonna be our ride
When we get to the fight, well, we won't be beat
As we watch Mike fight from the front row seats
Now I can't look into the future, I can't tell how long
The fight will go, but this I know, and I won't be wrong
When the bell rings and the deal goes down
Mighty Mike will still be wearin his champion's crown
He's Mighty Mike(Shoop)

(My-my-my girl)

Well, let me tell you 'bout a girl who's finer than fine
She used to be somebody else's, now she's mine
All the fellas said, "Spoonie, don't mess with that"
But it's been a year, and I still go by to see her
It ain't the perfume, well, it's just her
She got the greatest respect for me
She calls me Mr. Gee
And I reply, so fella, hey
No need to try, so you might as well stay away
You spend your money on my girl winin dinin
You're never gettin her back, so ain't no sense in me lyin
To you, what I'ma do? Well, our star did not tell
I took her out one night and I rocked her well
Now she's my girl

Now she's my only girl and you know that's true
But personally it was the right thing to do
To her, cause she was so fine and I was so kind
That when I asked the young lady, she said she didn't mind
Doin what I want, as long as it felt good
Well, you know without a doubt I did the best I could
When I wanted to leave, she wouldn't let me out
For some unknown reason told her friends all about
Me, she even said I was the best she had
But it could not be, if you didn't treat her bad-
Ly now you pretend that you love her so
Tell my friends that you want the girl back, but no
Way, gave her diamonds, I gave her pearls
And not to mention that I gave her my love
And that's why she's my girl

Now I'm the type of guy to make a girl feel good
And in return the young lady does the same, well should-
N't she? One hand washes the other, both wash the face
And as a matter of fact she's tas-
Ty, keeps my feelin like I never did before
My favorite words to the girl is 'more
Please', keeps me smilin, she keeps me feelin
Man, so good, if I was sick, she'd be my healin
My friend, my girl, soon to be my wife
And then she'll be mine for a life-
Time, for now she's my girl

Now sometimes we fuss, sometimes we fight
But we make everything alright before night-
Time, no fussin, no time for fightin
There's plenty good lovin, she's so excitin
She's got me doin things that I never did
Like flushin that stuff like a little kid
But no bedtime stories like Jack & Jill
Takes two to get a pail of water, be for real
If I climb any mountain, it'll be for fun
Not in order to get water, cause to me that's dumb
Without a stop I reach the top, and I won't fall down
Only to get busy if a girl's around
Now that I told you all about my girl
As you can see MC Spoonie Gee's the only one can do it
You say 'what?' well, I say satisfy
That pretty young lady, if you don't believe me try
It, with my girl[ VERSE 1 ]
Now girls call me lover, sometimes the rhyme sayer
I could be president, but I'll settle for mayor
With money in my pocket, girls at my side
Sit back and relax while we cruise in my ride
Not alone when I'm home, even when I'm asleep
If you've never been, girl, please come, cause I'm deep
Never broke one promise, won't break your heart
If you want me, baby, tell me when, so you can start
With Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee

If you're feelin down, baby, uplift I'll give
No frontin, no schemin, only doin the do
And if you play hard to get, you won't get got, it's true
I know Thomas's promises, so tell me your name
You're not sayin, cause you're playin, this is your last game

Can't stop the feelin once I hit my feet
If I order, young lady, want it nice and sweet
Not sour, I'll devour, and it won't last long
Like a weight that's too heavy, so I gotta be strong
She'll be cheating, then weeding her clothes at the door
With the note that I wrote: 'I don't want you no more'
So don't turn around, baby, go straight ahead
Stop cryin, cause you're lyin, what you're sayin is dead
It's Spoonie Gee

So don't ever cross me in no kind of way
And if you come to my house you see a bed to slay
I'm not tryin to be cute, but I admit you're fine
And I can see you and me walkin down the line
Say 'I' and don't lie, say 'do' as well
And if you don't decide, only time will tell
I'm not tryin to run your life, only give an advice
Soon to be you and me, well, it would be nice

Spoonie GeeI'm the godfather... of rap

Well let's get this straight, there's no contest
So now you people know don't have to guess
I'm not tha king of rap, not lord, not prince
I was a young kid rapper that I've been rapping ever since
I was just a young bub, I didn't care what mc's did
Before ??? cause I'm the godfather

I caught silly young ladies, two just chilled
They never said no to me - always say that they will do
Whenever I want them to - when I confront them to
Watch where ya're walkin', or just might browl to
I never rule them, I only school them
But if they ever try to fool me
That's when I foo them
I'm tha godfather

Long time to be chillin', just to make money
I rapped on stage, check my voice for your honey
Cause I'm rappin', and I'm not stoppin'
MC baby, who love stand hip-hopin'
So don't tease me, just kiss me
If ya already had a pimp, ya gonna miss me
I'm just a brother so what's upsaid
Cause it's a pretty ladies, I mean top like this
Ya know I'm the godfather

They say that I'm an mc some say that I'm a proud
I changed my style people just didn't know it yet
I had to tell them I might kill them
You mess with me I'm sick your ass then swell them
Woah like on the phone, I'm 'bout to take charge
At the station for the new car in my garage
They want to cruise me, they don't move me
See my bankroll they want to try to use me
But I'm no fool never losin' my cool
But for me to darkness I make the young ladies drool
I'm not braggin' tellin' you what I'm about
Young ladies no babies and marriage bout
But if you insist you can't convince your house are mine
Night or day we'll be fine
So let's get with it, so that I can't hit it
After an hour or two me and you can just quit it

I'm the godfather

There's no need to be smokin' when the fire is out
So take your hand off your hip and let's work out
No leanin' on the wall no standin' around
So are you ready (for what ?!) for the beat in me now
Because people can't see me so people want to be me
Pretty young ladies want L Blue Spoon
The beat so fair so ate 9 o'clock in the morning
If they're playin' they'll call the cops cause I'm the godfather

I'm the godfather

You got rockin' beat no stoppin' beat
Some roars have things pumpin' beat
All the rest of my time Jerry knows my side
I'm so dip that's why I keep all girls in your mind
I'm not dedicate this at the top of this
Say cool you bring, don't break the rules if you wanna get this
Respect me brother rapper recorded on the show
Ya could stare, cause I don't care it's just long you know

I'm the godfather

Now you be jumpin' your heart will be thumpin
Intendin' rappin', swearin' hip hopin'
Off your face, all know the place
Easely scatty standin' in pace
Don't stand around, your face road in my clan
This is the season no prisonner can't get down
So get all the world, let's up these words
Boogie down to the beat just give it to y'all
No need to get hot money dispenser
You can't have a good time cause it's so danger

I'm the godfather...of rap(It's showtime!)

Once they announce my name and I get out on stage
I'm just like an animal let out of his cage
I can't control myself, I start dancin and rhymin
People on the streets start droppin a dime and
Tellin everybody: "Hey, Spoonie Gee's housin
He got the people in the place jumpin and bouncin"
Up and down, hey, they just don't understand it
How do I get results, my brother I just demand it
It starts with a pen and a paper, then to a studio
With the engineer that says 'go', now you know
This is the place to be

This is the place to be

Now in this game you gotta be a perfect rapper
Be sharp, clean, dressed up, for me I just be dapper
Do what I have to, I make money, but no trouble
But if your head is swollen, I bust your bubble
Cause in this game, with fake MC's it's been polluted
The reason that I'm in it, cause in me it has been rooted
Before I was born Almighty God had a plan
He said, "You're gonna be a rapper, my man"
So - this is the place to be

This is the place to be

I finished my mission, I'm in a higher position
So when it comes to my records, choose to dance or just listen
You'll be excited, could never be bored
I'm givin you a piece of my talent you can't afford
It, so as the clock ticks and the time goes on
I thank God every minute for the day I was born
He gave me a talent, and above all the chance
To rap on the mic, to show you my dance
He wakes me up, then lays me down to sleep
So that I can write a record that can rock to the beat
You're feelin low and need somewhere to go?
You come check me out at the show, you know?
This is the place to be

This is the place to beWell, well, well..
There's that old man again
Runnin around with those young girls
Man, if he only knew how he looked
He look just like a fool

(But you's an old fool)		(3x)
(To the beat y'all)

(You ain't just a fool
But you's an old fool)		(2x)

[ VERSE 1 ]
You give her all your money and all of your time
And at the end of the week you ain't got one dime
To spend; you say you love her, she makes you feel young
But this only proves one thing: that you's a dumb-dumb
'Age's just a number', now gimme a break
She's only 16 and you're 68
Mistake, and plus you're married till death do us part
Soon as you see a young lady, you're ready to start
Flirtin, keep late hours at home and on the telephone
Talkin to the girl while you think she's alone
But she's not, she's with another guy
And if you knew, you'd die
She said, "This is my friend," you said, "How you're doin"
You ain't just a fool, but you's an old fool

(But you's an old fool)		(3x)
(To the beat y'all)

(You ain't just a fool
But you's an old fool)		(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
You're wastin your time, plus you're livin a lie
Because you'll never be able to compete with the other guy
Cause you're much too old, he's much younger
To her you're like drizzling rain, but he's thunder
Now you tell me, who do you think she'll choose
I bet you nine times out of ten you lose
But you can win your wife cause she'll be with you for a lifetime
But you don't want that, you rather ride a baby
Why don't you go home and eat some gravy train
That's dog food, that's what you deserve
If it was my daughter, brother, you would get served
There's no excuse, cause as a man you can fight that
Thank my Heavenly Father I ain't like that
You ain't just a fool, but you's an old fool

(But you's an old fool)		(3x)
(To the beat y'all)

(You ain't just a fool
But you's an old fool)		(2x)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now you told the girl to meet you at a disco spot
You dyed your hair and moustache to get a better shot
When you walked through the door, thought you was cool
Meanwhile behind your back she's callin you a fool
Wearin those old clothes that's older than me
You see, she wanted to laugh, you just couldn't see it
She said, "I'm leavin for business, meet me at my place"
You gave her 50 dollars and a 10 dollar chase
See, you waited all night, preferably into the morning
She came in all rubbled, stretchin and yawnin
You said, "I need some lovin," she said, "It's too soon
But here's a pillow, so you can sleep in the living room"
You ain't just a fool, but you's an old fool

(But you's an old fool)		(3x)
(To the beat y'all)

(You ain't just a fool
But you's an old fool)		(2x)When I went around the block people was lookin at me
My friend asked me why I'm so unhappy
The reason was because you wasn't with me
There to hold, love and to kiss me
But now since you're back from school
Let's go to my house and break a rule, baby
Cause the night is young
And you ain't dumb
So please gimme some
Of that yum yum, baby

You tell your girlfriends that you hate my guts
But if you hate me so much
Why did you kiss me last night?
You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
You put your hand on my knee when I was cool as ice
And jumped up from the sofa to fix me a drink and
The room got heated, and I knew what you was thinkin
Takes two to tango, but not me and you
Cause you're the kind, if it ain't right, you'll sue me
For all of my possessions and my privates too
So the only thing that you can do
Is gimme some yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby

Now you tell everybody that you're not my sweetie
But you're all in one, nice, tall and meaty
So gimme a chance and, girl, you'll see
That after one night, ooh baby, you'll love me
So if you change your mind, please let me know
Because sky is the limit anywhere we'll go
And we'll have a ball, baby, if not have fun
And in the process have a daughter or a son
Don't unestimate me, appreciate me
Cause I been feelin the need for love lately
The night is young and you ain't dumb
So gimme some of that yum yum, baby

You can come to my house, lay down and go to sleep too
It been a while, you'll see what I wanna do
I do it to the left and do it to the right
And if possible make love all night
I want yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby
Ice cream and cherries too
Put all of them together, and it's sweet as you
Not needing to tell me and you
You can't help yourself, so what ya gonna do?
You tell your mother and your father
Sister, uncle and your friend
A couple other people that are not your kin
About the yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby
Yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that - ooh baby

I went around my block, people was lookin at me
A friend asked me why I'm so unhappy
But now since you're back from school
Let's go to my house and break a rule
Baby, the night is young, and you ain't dumb
So gimme some of that yum yum, baby
You tell everybody that you hate my guts
But if you hate me so much
Why did you kiss me last night?

You know what, girl?
It's been a while
Since I had some real good lovin
But I don't know why you give me such a hard time, baby
I admit you're cute
Okay - you're fine
But baby, you're not worth it, man
That's right, I say 'man'
Cause that's the way you act sometime, you know

Yum yum, yum yum
Why don't you give me some
Yum yum, baby
Yum yum
Gimme some
Gimme some of that - ooh baby
