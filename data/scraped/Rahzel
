[2nd child] Bring me some of mah Cheesy Poofs right now!

[Everlast]
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behaving' like they ought to: good
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy
And this is what he said
"Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash
Robbing' old folks and making' the dash"
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, "keep still, boy, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun
He said, "Why'd you hit me?"
The barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
"I'll do years if I pull this trigger"
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good in expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming so he made a left
He was running' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw
Dave, the dope fiend shooting dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, "I need bullets, hurry up, run"
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was shattered
He rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets but still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, "back off or honey here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to move on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
He was only nineteen, in a madman's dream
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good night!

(Beat box by Rahzel till fade out)[Black Thought]
I woke up in the darkness at 12:17...to shots and sirens
Look out the window, peep the high beams
Now they searchin, the cops lookin for the person
That pulled the trigger
Medical figures is nursin the kid that got shot
Some innocent ak that would front
To flip the rock on them at McKean Street block
I tried to tell him to stop cuz yo, it's ghetto red hot
Similar to the blood now floodin his top
I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
And see the shorty wop heart blast out his back
Damn, I'm thinkin it don't cease, it's no more peace
Police level increase, but what the fuck...
It's still crime on the streets
I can't breathe, now what's goin on?
One minute you alive, the next, you're gone
Illadel-P-H-I-A Hell
Bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell
And hit the L, for the niggas who fell
When that could have been prevented
In front of the flat your moms rented
And no one expect that from you, cuz you was timid
Fuckin with them cats from outside city limits
Funny how this whole thing changed, an off minute
Yo, dig it, Panic!!!!!
None of this is ever granted
Drowning in a nightmare, stranded[Intro]
Uhh... Beatnuts! Masta Ace
Gettin cash to trash the place
Take a blast, c'mon, uh...
{"Oh my God"}

[Masta Ace]
Y'all rap dudes are funny, I don't feud with dummies
I don't need no problems, I need food and money
I recall when we used to fool with honeys
That was cute as bunnies with the smoothest tummies
Now we like Brink's tryin to move this money
Run with cast to Ak-man, rude and crummy
It's the chairman of the board and I'm carryin a sword
I look heavy in a Chevy and I'm scary in a Ford
F-150, you should just run swiftly
Unless you nice, you like it you can just come get me
Y'all dudes sweet like cakes and pies
I go together with rap like shakes and fries
And I hate them guys with hate in their eyes
Hopin we fall, can't wait to rise
Yeah, I'm all natural like a case of Snapple
And don't talk shit cause the Ace'll slap you
And don't try to run cause I'll chase and catch you
Put a sharp blade to your face and scratch you (ouch)
What'chu wan' fuck with a ninja for?
I'm like a cornered rat with a injured paw
And I'll bend your jaw and end your tour
Even if I lose the battle I'mma win the war, yeah

[Hook: Rahzel]
"Oh, my, God!"
When Beatnuts and Masta Ace both up in the place
It's like - "Oh, my, God!"
When you can't find your girl, your girl probably up in our face
She like - "Oh, my, God!"
It's mad ways to do it my man, and we doin it hard
We like - "Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh my, my, my God!"

[Psycho Les]
I don't mix weed with yay'
Let's take it to the streets nigga lead the way
I'mma watch you bleed your way into emergency
You're gonna need surgery
A facelift, face it, Psych' is whylin
Like them niggas on Rikers Island
Stab you with a spoon in the lunchroom
Have you hallucinatin {"Oh my God"} like you on mushroom
Head twitchin, like an epileptic
You'll get dropped (like what) like elephant shit
I'm from the home of the Yankees
You not feelin that then yank these, I'm sittin on twankies
You goin nowhere fast like a treadmill
Don't make me have to roll up to your crib and +Meet Your Parents+
Like Ben Still' - you'll get killed
For tryin to be a funny ass (like who) like Ben Hill (ha ha)
I don't, wanna have to run up in your label
And put a hole in ya head like a bagel (blaow!)
From here to Milwaukee
I do it for the kids like Bill Cosby (hey hey hey!)

[Hook]

[JuJu]
It's Big Ju the family favorite
You should just place the name on your forehead and staple it
I'm here y'all, I finally made it
Then I can be really cool to talk to when I'm medicated
One of the game's most underrated
I'm makin a hit, then everybody wanna recreate it
Every due that come through I paid it
So now if you bite this, I'm leavin you decapitated
Came to show you niggas I got soul
Me and the music man together bust out of control
It's a feelin that's hard to hold
Look, even if you pregnant it makes you wanna work that pole
Now tell me y'all, what's really good?
Cause everything I'm hearin on the radio is hillbilly hood
It's evident that I clearly should
Put a fuckin foot up your ass to make the shit understood

[Hook]

You better take your seat in this class
I'm psychic, I know what's really on your mind
Hmmmm, you wanna be fucked from behind
Take a motherfuck from the nine, don't call it a come-back
This goes verbal my spine, dispurse on the back of your dress
I saw your man sittin' downstairs he did look like whoress
Tryin' to call Chris your crew your crew
Why I gotta come down to this?
I'm here on the stage you like fuck Chris
But backstage I say; Yo you said what Chris?
What your tryin' to move you can't move inches
What your tryin' to pull your DJ's are bitches
Takin' you out that's a sin
You see a new trick like Linda
And fell on his dick like Lewinsky
Never try to get me, never try to outwit me
You can be removed like a titty
Now while I put twenty inch grins on my Benzo
What a car to sit, to low, and bend my fender(?)
Yo Domingo in the back, KRS-one, yes the god of rap

I got your mouth wide open, just like the Grand Canyon
I'm Trugoy, to this rap game, I got game
Call me Denzel, with the rap name, I got aim
"He's on FIRE!!" like a coal in a hot flame
Plus my Posdonuses, produces, your prognosis
Kids doin the chronic from coast to coast kid
Death, what the doctor ordered, so say, "Ahhh"
Take you +Three Feet High and Risin+, like De La
C'est la vie, I'm yo' super MC
Got the S on my chest for you to buy my LP
Check the outlets for cassettes and CD
Sam Goody, Blockbustin' up your H M V
Nigga please, ask yo mamma for some cheese
Tell her need some restitution like them Vietnamese
In Vietnam, cause Rahzel drops the bomb
More complex than texts, in your Holy Qu'ran

Chorus[1st child] Uncle Whitey! Uncle Whitey, could you tell us a bedtime story?
[2nd child] Dat's right! We wanna hear a bedtime story!
[1st child] Please! Could you tell us a bedtime story?
[2nd child] Bring me some of mah Cheesy Poofs right now!

[Everlast]
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behaving' like they ought to: good
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy
And this is what he said
"Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash
Robbing' old folks and making' the dash"
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, "keep still, boy, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun
He said, "Why'd you hit me?"
The barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
"I'll do years if I pull this trigger"
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good in expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming so he made a left
He was running' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw
Dave, the dope fiend shooting dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, "I need bullets, hurry up, run"
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was shattered
He rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets but still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, "back off or honey here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to move on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
He was only nineteen, in a madman's dream
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good night!

(Beat box by Rahzel till fade out)[Verse 1]
If I lay low and let the day go it'll slow my payroll
Aye-yo I'm a terrorize charge and slay shows
Ra slay flows go as far as the Barbados
On the turntable sound like tornadoes
My style is performed like tropical storms
Your not to get on the whole spot will get torn
I keep the metropolitan hollering and bring the dollars in
Keep the models following wise as King Solomon
Come slow through the jungle like an animal
Invade any land I go like General Hannibal
From Long Island to Queens light up the New York scenes
All the way to New Orleans and everything in between
Left to go bless a show in Mexico
Next Thing I know it's extra cold I see Eskimo's
Time to rock get it hot soon as I get in there
Spit in they ear so flow they froze and I disappear

[Hook]
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me
It's inherited it runs in the family

[Verse 2]
They said I was a head of my time or either here before
To see the idea clear it takes a year or more
Now times that by the years I reign straight-seven
No hear for four years still multiplied by eleven
The silence's a set back make em regret that
One way to get back is violence and wet cats
But hold your head black or I'll never rap again
Just when I thought I was out they pulled me back in
Now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering
Then I'm a go back to the gat and racketeering
My sabotage is camaflouge and espionage
You ain't havin Ra so don't test the god
I'm takin' all orders I can't afford extorters
I hit em in the head with a hundred dollars in quarters
So warn a friend tell em it's on again
If it's a freestyle bust in a park I want in

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I managed to get paid for a decade now add three years on to that
Perform with a knack yes I was born to rap
The mic Lebanon Teflon don is back
I strike with better bombs and armed to attack
So reload the van go ahead let em in
Every tours a war and I'm on the road again
Suprise a town the place it's live and loud
We vibin' now I go wild and dive in the crowd
Never hit the ground they catch me and carry me around
Then put me right back on stage to shut it down
From New York to Cali, Japan and I-tali
I'm known as the microphone Muhammad Ali
I'm worldwide my brothers be biggin' me up
Keep the girls occupied lovin' diggin' me what
Ain't around when I come to town they mad glad
Like Saddaam they even say I'm the bomb in Baghdad

[Hook]Those haunting rhymes are keeping the time
But they'll never get through to me
It's my party, but I'm waiting for someone to start it
It's my party, there's no one but me in the corner
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?

Now roll it up and smoke it again
Now line me up and snort it again
Now fix it up and shoot it again
I can't believe I did it again

Keep haunting me, taunting me
But they'll never get through to me

It's my party, but I'm waiting for someone to start it
My party, there's blood on the ceiling, the carpet
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?

Now roll it up and smoke it again
It's bottoms up and drink it again
Now fix it up and shoot it again
I can't believe I did it again

I'm readin' the signs, makes me wonder why they're getting through to me
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?

Now roll it up and smoke it again
It's bottoms up and drink it again
Now fix it up and shoot it again
I can't believe I did it again

Oops, I did it again{BZzT, BRRAAAP, TRANZZ-FOR-MATION}

Wait right here, I'll be right back
(Michael's callin .. I have to go)
(Callin the Rick .. I have to go)

[Slick Rick]
Rap battle one two, one two, check it out
All alone, gold song, like Mike Corleone
Get a little ? while in the pen, still hold the throne
Blood is the same for us to spill
I give off the impression it's no thing for us to kill
Around the way with -- street corner game, Pat Sajak
Got kids to feed, you can't stop the paycheck! (Mhmm)
A lettergram said that you're ahead of him
Nowhere on the planet nigga can't rap better than
So know that I'm the flyest, bypass
By you and your tired-ass bow down to my ass
I shit on a kid wanna vic wanted KITT
What's ?? Slick Rick, this one is dead
Life's finished, this rapper ??
Me and Rahzel on the record no cat career finished
Jump in my car, better buckle up
KITT, hurry, get me 'cross town to wreck another club

Chorus: Rahzel and Slick Rick

"For all of y'all, keepin y'all in health (to what?)
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself"
Rahzel, what's my name? {Ehh-ehh, ehh-Slick Rick}
What's the timeframe? {SIX MINUTES TO DESTINATION}
Set the hydraulics {Awwahha, "Ohh my gosh!"}
And the low mileage, make sure the car's polished
Got all the girls screamin just to hear me flow
{Aha-wweeh, "Hereeeee we goooooooo..."}

[Slick Rick]
No not rich, old boy bougie
Car KITT known to get Rolls Royce pussy
In front of y'all opponent, the man be arrogant
Is there some part of "I can slaughter anyone" that all you don't get?
My records, are ??, how dare announce attack us
Jack shit suave more debonaire about your black ass
Slick pose with another gold hit
By self eliminate a motherfucker whole click
.. All assume in the cut
Motherfucker even question if I'm human or not!
Who that swingin in Seacaucus? The gorgeous, of course it's
Thoughtless, c'mon KITT, the King of New York is
And now it's gettin kind of dark, ??
Westside Highway, park by the Tunnel
Bad car horn oinks off the man's points
Walk in, niggas havin a ball off of Rah's joint

Chorus 3X[Intro]
Uhh... Beatnuts! Masta Ace
Gettin cash to trash the place
Take a blast, c'mon, uh...
{"Oh my God"}

[Masta Ace]
Y'all rap dudes are funny, I don't feud with dummies
I don't need no problems, I need food and money
I recall when we used to fool with honeys
That was cute as bunnies with the smoothest tummies
Now we like Brink's tryin to move this money
Run with cast to Ak-man, rude and crummy
It's the chairman of the board and I'm carryin a sword
I look heavy in a Chevy and I'm scary in a Ford
F-150, you should just run swiftly
Unless you nice, you like it you can just come get me
Y'all dudes sweet like cakes and pies
I go together with rap like shakes and fries
And I hate them guys with hate in their eyes
Hopin we fall, can't wait to rise
Yeah, I'm all natural like a case of Snapple
And don't talk shit cause the Ace'll slap you
And don't try to run cause I'll chase and catch you
Put a sharp blade to your face and scratch you (ouch)
What'chu wan' fuck with a ninja for?
I'm like a cornered rat with a injured paw
And I'll bend your jaw and end your tour
Even if I lose the battle I'mma win the war, yeah

[Hook: Rahzel]
"Oh, my, God!"
When Beatnuts and Masta Ace both up in the place
It's like - "Oh, my, God!"
When you can't find your girl, your girl probably up in our face
She like - "Oh, my, God!"
It's mad ways to do it my man, and we doin it hard
We like - "Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh my, my, my God!"

[Psycho Les]
I don't mix weed with yay'
Let's take it to the streets nigga lead the way
I'mma watch you bleed your way into emergency
You're gonna need surgery
A facelift, face it, Psych' is whylin
Like them niggas on Rikers Island
Stab you with a spoon in the lunchroom
Have you hallucinatin {"Oh my God"} like you on mushroom
Head twitchin, like an epileptic
You'll get dropped (like what) like elephant shit
I'm from the home of the Yankees
You not feelin that then yank these, I'm sittin on twankies
You goin nowhere fast like a treadmill
Don't make me have to roll up to your crib and +Meet Your Parents+
Like Ben Still' - you'll get killed
For tryin to be a funny ass (like who) like Ben Hill (ha ha)
I don't, wanna have to run up in your label
And put a hole in ya head like a bagel (blaow!)
From here to Milwaukee
I do it for the kids like Bill Cosby (hey hey hey!)

[Hook]

[JuJu]
It's Big Ju the family favorite
You should just place the name on your forehead and staple it
I'm here y'all, I finally made it
Then I can be really cool to talk to when I'm medicated
One of the game's most underrated
I'm makin a hit, then everybody wanna recreate it
Every due that come through I paid it
So now if you bite this, I'm leavin you decapitated
Came to show you niggas I got soul
Me and the music man together bust out of control
It's a feelin that's hard to hold
Look, even if you pregnant it makes you wanna work that pole
Now tell me y'all, what's really good?
Cause everything I'm hearin on the radio is hillbilly hood
It's evident that I clearly should
Put a fuckin foot up your ass to make the shit understood

[Hook]

{"What's the matter trailer, can't you take a little heat?"}[Black Thought]
I woke up in the darkness at 12:17...to shots and sirens
Look out the window, peep the high beams
Now they searchin, the cops lookin for the person
That pulled the trigger
Medical figures is nursin the kid that got shot
Some innocent ak that would front
To flip the rock on them at McKean Street block
I tried to tell him to stop cuz yo, it's ghetto red hot
Similar to the blood now floodin his top
I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
And see the shorty wop heart blast out his back
Damn, I'm thinkin it don't cease, it's no more peace
Police level increase, but what the fuck...
It's still crime on the streets
I can't breathe, now what's goin on?
One minute you alive, the next, you're gone
Illadel-P-H-I-A Hell
Bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell
And hit the L, for the niggas who fell
When that could have been prevented
In front of the flat your moms rented
And no one expect that from you, cuz you was timid
Fuckin with them cats from outside city limits
Funny how this whole thing changed, an off minute
Yo, dig it, Panic!!!!!
None of this is ever granted
Drowning in a nightmare, strandedI am original DJ Jazzy Jay from
The mighty mighty Zulu Nation
First off, I'm gonna say my name is
Original scratch creator Grand Wizard Theodore

For those who don't know, I started back out in the '74
Afrika Bambata, Disco King Mario
Cool Herc, Grand Master Flash
And you know some of the pioneers
That did it back then, ya know

Hip hop is universal man, it all depends upon what ya do it
Hip hop is like what you call a bastard child of
A lot of different forms of music
I just feel good, that a lot of our bands are like
Are like, recognizing, ya know, the culture

We used to play these beats because
They used to drive us on the dance floor
And people don't really know that as a rock record
Until like the guitars come in and stuff like that

We didn't have no hip hop beats back in the days
We had to take it from everywhere, we can get it from
Its just trying to take it to another level
That what keeps the music new and keeps it fresh

As far as, ya know, rock is concerned man
I think rock is, ya know, a big part of hip hop man
Rock helped influence hip hop
Hip hop helped influence the world

La la la
La la la
La la la

Shh, yeah, hey
Shh, you hear me
Okay, listen

Yo, it's like a triple stage darkness, listen and drift
Every muscle in your skin starts to shake and shift
You can hate the gift but my phrase is dazed
Ya click spray your face when I spit, I mean it
You're just too conceited, repeatin' and repeatin'
You're a thugged out gangsta pimp 'till you believe it

Seems like there's too much 'Pac, we don't need it
I'm cool on your heat, you can keep it
It's not a big secret, this is a game you can't win
You're singin' the same thing
Though we're bringin' the yen
So just close your eyes and pretend again
That your skin isn't as thin
As the skin you're in bitch

Give me a second just to spell it out
So nobody can twist what I'm talkin' about
I don't have to fake anything I feel because
We both know every word is real

So give me a second just to spell it out
So nobody can twist what I'm talkin' about
I don't have to fake anything I feel because
We both know every word is real

Right about now, the funk soul brother
Check it out now, the funk soul brother
Right about now, the funk soul brother
Check it out now, the funk soul brother

I got the skills of titanium, straight to the cranium
Try to play me, and we could go to war like Iranians
The deep cat, I speak rap
As long as the beat phat, my shit'll be off the meat rack

Lord Finesse, don't harass the god
Spit four bars and piss on, like half your squad
So the savage, I don't gay bash
I don't harass if you niggas
Playin' Russian roulette with automatics

See, on the street, I'm top in rank
Three words, when I get the dice, stop the bank
Bet against me, you get your cash to me
My street team, promote nothin' but ass whoopins

Hard headed, handsome boys, the lost niggas
The type that sport the chicks on their arm like John Ritter
The bomb niggas, being stabbing the third
Better play like Jehovah witness, and spread the word

This sky opens wide, swallowing again
Once I am inside, I'm lost and can't pretend
These pictures in my mind are not a part of me
These memories all the time till I can hardly breathe
I can hardly breathe, I can hardly stop the memories

Nothing I can say or do
Will take away what I've been through
What you were is what I've come to be
Nothing you can say to me
Will take away these memories
What you were is what I've come to be

La la la
La la la

{They taught me to look beyond
The superficial at the Handsome Boy Modeling School
One of the things that I look for in a woman is you know, personality
And I look for a sense of humor
And you know knockers, I'm just kidding
Like I said, I, I used to look at a woman
You know, chestal area first}

{I mean, the things that I look for now
Is that I look for a woman with money
I look for a woman with long legs
Whereas before I used to focus on, knockers or}

{Wait one second my illegitimate son is here
Yes, yes son, you want one of these?
Well, you have to go to the Handsome Boy Modeling School
Where you can get one okay?
Okay, daddy's got to work some more now

(I'm honored to be here with the Teacher)
I'm on one knee right now
KRS in the building!

[KRS-One]
Look, retire? Not yet! Out my fire? Not yet!
Your skills higher? Not yet!
You wanna be called kings and 'siahs
But you sing for hire, you free? Not yet!
Face the truth, but not yet!
You blazed the booth but you still ain't hot yet!
Not yet! KRS rhymes next, I'm complex
I came too far to drop bars for Sadat X
BX is on the block yes, this the top set
Some of them others are not yet!
But they act like they got the top rep
Claiming king, but y'all ain't put a thing back into Hip Hop yet
Got checks? We got pockets
Got TECs? We got rockets
You got clubs, we got sockets
You got beats, we got topics
Come in Sadat X!

[Sadat X]
Sadat X and the teacher, it's a creature, a beast of burden
Energy exerting is few, cause rule is
The fool is shot with his own gun
I'm up with the sun in the earliest
It's no more about the burners
You've seen The First 48, murder is rap now
So is smoking crack now, it's a new hustle, new gaffle
You can win a raffle and be a rapper
She's just telling the truth and you get mad and want to slap her
I'm not a banger, never heard me with a real R&B singer
I never had that, but I'm not mad at them tunes
I've been through bitter cold Decembers and brilliant Junes
Black man hold your seed up to the moon like roots
And let 'em digest these fruits, it's good to live on

[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. scratches by Rahzel]

"I blow up the spot"
"I blow up the spot with my man Sadat"

[KRS-One]
Yo, open up your eyes now
Everyone talking bout crime now
It's like we going back in time now
I'm ready to shine now, get mine now
But the more I climb now, I find now
Cats don't want you to rise now
They want to hold you back
By replacing the facts with the lies now
But watch the skills I apply now
I'm gonna be +BIG+ but I ain't +Ready to Die+ now
Why mothers gotta cry now?
Cause some dumb ass kid now is believing in the lie now
What's the lie now? The lie is you ain't gotta try
Cause everybody out getting high now
Why now? Cause you might see Chinese bombers
Flying across American skies now
Man, I'm telling you to rise now
Don't worry about your size now, it's time to get wise now

[Chorus]

[Sadat X]
Now I'ma show you charm and keep you away from harm
And then I'ma throw you something on the arm
I'ma show you pull, show you how to keep your calendar full
With show dates in Europe and the States
Eastern District, one-sixty-first, where the new Yankee stadium
Use has built over the park, it only take a spark
To light the bomb, then I'm off to four Auburn or I'm
Passing the Millbrook projects
The Nine Life Crew, one-five-two
Park Avenue, Grand Pu' to {?}
I'm a problem on all joints, I need all points I touch
Had Rahzel do the Biggie chorus, we loved him that much
See Miss Jacob stayed on the hutch
She can't wait till I stop, she pop myself with the clutch
Sometimes she real tender to touch
I stray, but she don't really hold no grudge

[Chorus][Intro] ]Rahzel]:
30 seconds to respond. 30 seconds to respond to our mind controlling mechanism. 30 seconds to respond to our mind controlling mechanism. We are now controlling your mind. We are now controlling your mind. We are now controlling your mind. Ultramagnetic

Yo. Man verses machine. Rahzel with DJ JS-1 AKA John Stockton. Ultramagnetic

[Verse One] [Kool Keith]:
I be that hype dude, check one for the altitude
Brand new, double K and an alpha mood
I pitch it like that, I switch it like that, you mix it like that
Man verses machine
I did it like that
Super so nice, super so coke, super so ice
The hype is nice as foes go micless for pimp ho prices
Your terrible, switch back
Whether you get smacked
I just did that
Your toy is a Kit Kat, you man can skit skat
With definite wordplay, no chat, hearsay
Style more great than
Style more better than
Style more quotable
Style more veteran
Suckers want the evidence, yep rap president

[Verse Two] [Canibus]:
Can-I-Bus, known and respected for his own method
The U.F.O. records was just the beginning
My muscles are repairin', I'm losin' my hearin'
My spirit still too close for you to come near it
My legacy ends
Again and again and again and again
And 100 more of them
Who wanna contend? You need a 100 more men
My speech starts the planet, multiples of ten
I gain solace every rhyme I deposit
The V.A. gave me supposed combat chronic
?  response recovery
Who beat the blood out the beat, wasn't me
A new man emerged, badly burned
I just put the track back on the Bradley sir
Presto, zuto, tropical storm Ernesto
As told my Admiral West on Dead Zone
Out in Florida, low key
Nah homie, this water fountain right here for aliens only
The commando dosey doe in his ranch home
The boarder sun rise in the valley of the moon
I howl like I mean it
I had me a ? priestess behind the rose wall, secrets
21 bars, Necronomicon Laws
I can't do a chore I'm a danger to you all
23 bars, Necronomicon Laws
I can't do a chore I'm a danger to you all

"You're a slave to my sound waves"

[Chorus] [Kool Keith]:
I'm sendin' brains a bendin'
"You're a slave to my sound waves"
I'm sendin' brains a bendin'
"You're a slave to my sound waves"[Hook:] X 4
I can't stop
I really don't care about those other carbon copies
Don't stop Bobby, don't stop

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm the microphone champi-on
Any stage you get me on or let me on
My ambi-once is one step beyond
Then my song is a correspond with the audi-once
Experi-once the Renaiss-once, my reson-once is really on
Wonder Twin powers activate
Put the tape on, I can take on any shape, form
Size or weight, shape of Activation Voltron
Imagine all the microphones in the world I spit it on
Imagine the next MC step to me gettin' shitted on
You can even ask the girl about the bed we did it on
I hit it from the back to Marvin Gaye's Let's Get it On
Don't get it wrong, give it a thong, she put it on, in uniform
Sippin Don Periogne, Shawn Don, fillet mignon
Long horns stick and move until the cameras come on
Until the cameras are gone from there on, dusk till dawn
Get your grind on, now put your panties back on
Thank you for your cooperation
Rahzel, on your Hot 97 station

Yo, I'm one of the illest vocalists to ever turn the mic on
Let me download my sound, catalog the microns
(Computer noises) Turn your website on
WWW dot transmission d-d-d-d-d-dot sitcom
Got your girl buck naked on the cover, right on
3-d visually enhanced on your cd-rom
EP-rom, erasable, programmable and only
Memory accesible when you're pc's on
We can battle for your soul like Ki Yong Song
We can battle for your girl like Rae Dawn Chong
Yo you're mother's so fat she wears a three piece thong
Made of polyester-cryllic, rip stop nylon
With a skully cap that stretches three feet long
98 degrees outside, with a sheepskin on
I play you and your mom like Donkey Kong
Check this out

(Videogame noises)

[Hook] X 4

[Verse 3]
Yo we got the hottest, wildest fiber optic
Double O 7 James Bond, talkin in your watch shit
Watch this, Baywatch shit
Topless, there's no way you could stop this, spotless
Keep the flame up in the cockpit
(?) on some New Kids on the Block shit
My worse man is nothin' but profit
While you keep secrets and gossip
The Officer, the Gentleman
Chiseled out, President, call me Lou Gosset
This is for the players who pop shit
Frontin like you got shit
PHD, without the doctrate
If it wasn't for break beats, you'd be rhymin over my shit
Often transformin on stage, the Super DJ
2000 beats per minute, with an arcade
Round 1 fight, Street Fighter 3, pro tours with an upgrade
Call the paramedics to fed-ex some first aid
My cahlistenics been magnetic since first grade
We can battle in the doorway or the hallway
We can take the shit to the street, off and on Broadway
We can battle where you buy your cheap ass clothes in front of
Comway
We can battle in the passenger seat of your motherfuckin Hyundai

Well it is just back save it up punch in their mouth
You take a little tribe upon me son
I'm like that alcohol that battled your father, remember I won
Used to beat your ass, now you take for me bash
You better take your seat in this class
I'm psychic, I know what's really on your mind
Hmmmm, you wanna be fucked from behind
Take a motherfuck from the nine, don't call it a come-back
This goes verbal my spine, dispurse on the back of your dress
I saw your man sittin' downstairs he did look like whoress
Tryin' to call Chris your crew your crew
Why I gotta come down to this?
I'm here on the stage you like fuck Chris
But backstage I say; Yo you said what Chris?
What your tryin' to move you can't move inches
What your tryin' to pull your DJ's are bitches
Takin' you out that's a sin
You see a new trick like Linda
And fell on his dick like Lewinsky
Never try to get me, never try to outwit me
You can be removed like a titty
Now while I put twenty inch grins on my Benzo
What a car to sit, to low, and bend my fender(?)
Yo Domingo in the back, KRS-one, yes the god of rap
I got JS on the wheels of steel
You know how we feel, Rahzel hit the real!!

[Verse 1]
It's the human soundwave, straight out your comic book
Sound effects blazin through your rhymin' book
Just imagine, all the time it took, for me to master this
The Art of Noise is hazzardous
Imagine this, every sound from my lips
At my fingertips I levitate the audience
So ask Brooks and Dres who's got the effects
More dark than Mardi Gras, rugged like Gortex
Reach out and touch your whole crew like Nynex
Sprint for the stage cause MC onyx
Flip more connects than your internet
Rhymes is on time, I'm always on-line
Pump this in your Lex coupe, Benz, or Pathfind
Reverse the third verse nigga, then press rewind

[Hook:]
Make the music with your mouth (Rah-Razhel)
Make the music with your mouth (Rah-Rahzel)
Make the music with your mouth (Rah-Rahzel)
You make the music with your mouth
The music with your mouth

[Verse 2]
Yo yo, I'm takin the world by storm when I perform
Arm arm, leg-a leg-a head, watch me transform
(Transforming noises) Decepticons!
Rainin' on your college ass, this goes on
I'm animated, never dorm-ant, so change the format
What I'm strong at, Mortal Kombat, so Cheech and Chong that
(Fighting noises) Heh, brother damn you!
Heh, seems you're pretty good with your kung fu!
Now where's my Yong Fu at, my glass of cognac?
Digital readout with a comsat, but I'm not that smart cat
Let's track back, slick wanna eat that, you want my feedback?
(Computer noises) Now let's delete that
Now repeat that, I'm takin' the streets back like I'm sweep back
Think you could beat that?
I'm bringin the heat back on the street track

(Scratching) Marley Marl bring the beat back!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rahzel, call me Optimus Prime
Third verse, eight bars, ain't no stoppin this rhyme
I did this years ago, I guess I'm ahead of my time
Computerized, that's my mental design
(?) short of Euclid, I'm runnin through clicks with a few tricks
An accoustics, John Woo flicks on some new shit
Heh, all I wanted was some rice cakes!
Rahzel soundwave controllin' your whole tri-state

[Hook with variations, till fade][Aaron Hall]
You know I love you baby.. suga sista
You know I need you baby.. suga sista
You know I love you baby.. suga sista
You know I need you baby.. suga sista
You know I love you baby.. suga SISTA!!
You know I need you baby..

I just got home from off another world tour
I'm outside, in the rain, it's beginnin to pour
Can't understand why you changed the locks on the door
Got all my drawers and socks outside on the lawn
What's right is wrong, we used to make love to this song
Twice as long, especially when the nights were long
Suga even in the dark, or when the lights were on
Sista even in the park, lover my life is gone
I saw the flaws, now we both grabbin for straws
Over some love letters you found, in the top dresser drawer
I'm missin you more, the sweet scent of Christian Dior
Kissin you more, forever pro-missin you more
We need to communicate and start listenin more
Baby from experience, I've been through it before
I found the message in a bottle washed up on the shore
Signed from, Sincerely Yours, I can't take it no more

[Aaron Hall]
No I'll never turn my back on you
I never wanna do you wrong, Suga Sista
No I'll never turn my back on you
I never wanna do you wrong, Suga Sista
Sugahhhhhh Sistahhhh!

Another episode, had the keys to the Yukon
Tried to call her on the celly but she didn't respond
Had my finger on redial now I'm callin her moms
Kept gettin the voicemail now I'm losin my calm
Though she's probably with the next man, wrapped in his arms
Probably caught up in the mix, where she didn't belong
On the topic of trust, misgivings was leading me wrong
On the topic of us, misgivings was treating me wrong
Reading me wrong, now we not getting along
You never miss a good thing baby until it is gone
The thrill is gone, you can hear my heart, spill on this song
Wishin Once Upon a Time could stand still on this song
If the feelings is strong, then a countermove would be wrong
If the feelings is gone, then you know it's time to move on
If the feelings is torn, then I was right all along
If you think that I'm wrong, then pick my drawers off the lawn

[Aaron Hall]
No I'll never turn my back on you
I never wanna do you wrong, Suga Sista (Sista.. Sista..)
No I'll never turn my back on you
I never wanna do you wrong, Suga Sista
Suga Sista, Suga Sissss

[Black Thought]
At first I came to a halt, it was your fault
Had me frozen on the avenue just watchin you walk
Up in your presence I was caught, breath, becomin short
I had to step to this to let you know you had my support
I said, "I'm Black Thought, from out the 2-1-5th
Maybe you heard about the Dynasty I do run with
Me and The Roots done ripped, from Illadel' across the planet
Ya see, we on some shit some find it hard to understand it
But back, to what you all about or how you are at
What type of Science did you Knowledge was your mental intact?"
To converse, at first, let me know you knew the day and time
I had to catch you, mentally makin you mine
While I'm lookin at you, physical chiseled that of a statue
Type of shit to make you travel from Philly to the Big Apple
It feels kind of crazy, reminiscin back through
No need to sweat the backturnin, keep it on the true and actual
As I get into your thought, for all infinity
Shower you in masculinity, reinforcin your sense
Of femininity, bless you with this, the true indentity
Nothin but respect in your vicinity
Since, the Suga Brown from the level of Foun-dation of ground
So together we forever bound
We could make, heavenly sounds like a musical blend
Throughout the bad times and beautiful things, it's like that

[Aaron Hall]
No I'll never turn my back on you
I never wanna do you wrong, Suga Sista
(I'll never turn my back on you, SUGA SISS!)
No I'll never turn my back on you
I never wanna do you wrong, Suga Sista
(Suga Sista, Suga Sista, Suga Sista, Suga Sissss-tah
My Suga, Sista, yeah yeah)
No I'll never turn my back on you
I never wanna do you wrong, Suga Sista {* music and vocals fades*}[Intro: Rahzel]

Download my digital, digital voice stream

{*vocal beatbox until end*}* Rahzel does the beatboxing, Q-Tip does all the vocals

To the beat (echoes)

[Q-Tip talking]
Uh, what, takin' you back
All the way back
On the Rahzel track

[Hook:] X 2
To the beat, and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat (echoes)

[Verse 1 (Q-Tip)]
I let my m-i-i-i-i-i-i-nd flow, like a river
But now, Red and Dead sea constantly I MC
No conspiracy like Pope and Cons-tinople
Makin' tracks by theyself, you know I bless a little vocal
Artistry since constipated
Nowadays we're with Rahzel, we're glad we waited
Now we got you, right in the spot where we want it
And every single negative vibe is confronted
It's kinda ill when you let your music go free flowin
Buildin' on improvised grounds and still growin
People work hard, some wanna escape
But yo we gotta face the music with ease and with grace
Sometimes we look to jams for an inner inspiration
Cause the lyrics and the rhythm are the music vibrations
Makin things gel like a compound equation
Mad sounds culminatin' for one sensation

[Hook] X 2

[Verse 2 (Q-Tip)]
Lights, camera, action, get it on
Watch the beatbox as he lets the sound form
Ain't nobody iller than my man Rahzel
So you other beat machines don't stress and get gel
A very short suggestion is you go and work harder
Give me a Break, my man is phat like Nell Carter
With a brother like the (?) on top with the willy
We the illy, he's phildeplh we the rusaphilly
It's a thunderous move like a herd of elephants
And it sounds real raw cause we in our element
Like natural, never catch these kids on sabbatical
Always up front tryin to give you what you want
You see it's very crucial that we stand and deliver
Always tryin to rise above and be a good figure
And we hopin that you diggin on the rhymes that we wrote
Better get yourself together, let's flow, come on

[Hook] X 4
