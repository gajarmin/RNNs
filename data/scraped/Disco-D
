[Intro-50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm trying to catch me something
A little jux or somethin

[Hook-50 Cent]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse 1-50 Cent]
You wanna spray at me go ahead; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new sig and that old 38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching Dre serve skunk through a hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek with marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, yeah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2-50 Cent]
Who's that peeping in my window - WOW, the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleeping, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming fuck Jake
I'm trying to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at AI peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on the spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low key[Intro]
Don Cannon: Yo Ash!
Asher Roth: What's up man?
Don Cannon: If you could have any cartoon chick, who would it be?
Asher Roth: It's funny you should ask that...

[Verse 1]
Right of the bat I'd have Jessica Rabbit
She's the baddest, I love them tatties
Yeah that chest pressed, in that red dress
And I'm obsessed, yes, yes, with redheads
So Ariel would get it in the shower
Do Beauty with Beast, Eiffel tower
I'd take Jasmine on a magic carpet ride
Then I'd ride her carpet until I made it fly
And Cinderella's better than the step sisters
Gives the best head and is the best kisser
Unless of course she forgot the glass slippers
Then Fairy God Mother is the one to give the dick to
Mulan's punan is oh so sweet
Wake Sleeping Beauty up when I get her in the sheets
I'd fuck with Snow White cause I heard she was a freak
Yo, forget Hugh Heff, I'm rolling with Disney

[Hook]
If you could fuck a cartoon chick, which one would you pick
If you could fuck a cartoon chick, which one would get the dick
Cause if you had a cartoon chick, she wouldn't blow up your phone
I don't need a cartoon chick: I can just draw my own

[Verse 2]
I'd Scooby-Doo Daphney while Betty Boop watched
Told Judy Jetson yo can get on top
Yeah, of course I'd do Wilma but Betty's mad hot
Not Fred Flintstone but I'll make her bedrock
I'd fuck Ã†on Flux and Rouge from X-Men
And maybe Rainbow Brite cause I heard she was a lesbian
Smurfette would get it because of my blue fetish
So that includes Marge Simpson, too, get it?

[Hook x2]

Yo, Dave, you know who else I would do? Louis Griffin
You ever seen that episode when she had that thing, and she was just, like, in nothing, in that picture? Pheww![Verse 1]
Brooklyn we go hard
We on the look for the advantage, we work hard
And if we seem to rough it up a bit
We broke but we rich at heart
Pull ourselves up now we won't choke
It's our time, put the lights on us

War tactics they make me sick
Reel your heart in run away with it
Smile in your face, undermine your back
Got guns for the strength they lack
So if you know another way
You can't look the other way
If you know another way
Tell them so right to their face

[Hook]
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine

[Verse 2]
I pay for what's called
Eccentricity and my wish to evolve
I hear them all say
That I got heart
But not everything that it takes

Taint my mind but not my soul
Tell you I got fire
I won't sell it for no payroll
Let 'em hold me down
I know if I know another way
I can't look the other way
I know another way
I'll tell them so right to their face

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spank Rock]
Entirely, totally
Bring it all together, I want everything
If it's in the spills they had gossip that meant
We can't be poor folks waiting on a trickle with your hands out

I got a life that you can call a luck because it was a duty
You don't mean I ain't payin' dues, you stupid fuck
I'm more of a mind for reaching things that you can't
Just know I'm doing something you ain't
Simple and plain

[Hook: Repeats 2 times][AZ]
Gon' let it ride out
This what the world been missin right here
Best kept secret

[Hook: AZ]
We all evolved from the city of Gods, we all evolved from the city of Gods
We all evolved from the city of Gods, staf Allah, just give me the nod
Get dough, get low, live life, get nice, rock ice, buy cars, buy bikes
Take trips, live rich, eat good, get dipped, stay hood, stack chips, that's it

[AZ]
Sex cars clothes money and murder, from soldier to server
Hood hoppin, hopin the merger rockin
My own pops got me open on bonus, no option
Had a heart problem, copin with murmurs the doctrine
No Cochran, winnin since niggas was woppin
Way when Rakim was knockin
Streets was what it was when, thugs was thugs and
Gun wars galore goin slug for slug and
Jewels drugs and all, niggas love is love
With the crew wall to wall, I'll be bugged above
So beef war, this way too deep to sleep
Niggas keep up, cause certified killers creep
Stole this lady I, drove her crazy
You ask me why cause her man tried to play me
So reload quickly and, you better hit me while
I'm lettin this pretty chick get with me
Steppin with double-oh-seven better make it snappy
No time to do your hair baby, brothers is bustin at me
Blunts and bottles passed, but none on target
They want the God hit, but watch how low I get
Low as Saddam and his pawns so unharmed I'm unarmed
Though I'm calm I could yawn sing a song
I'm the don king of dons
King Kong could bring it on
Word is bond

[Hook] - second half, repeated 2X

[AZ]
Of course it's the kid that cut dope and, never got nauseous
Cooked coke on the comeback, never took losses
With one rap got rich off a "Life's a Bitch" chorus
That Jigga shit, nine-six, sittin with bosses
"Dead Presidents" see, represents we are
All as one, the call has come to Gods
"Street's Disciple" discrete, but it be's just like you
Never off beat, stay in reach of them rifles
Spiteful, no religion, no facelifts no small incisions
No cases pending though I got dawgs in prison
Reckless livin though, rest is like the Mets in them extra innings
Hope niggas respect my dealings if not
Hope not then I, catch no feelings
When you start hearin niggas left, stretched in buildings
Cold killings old villains now surfacing
In yo' vicinities enemies circlin, in sin
Praise I, unfold the untold like De La
No Soul since 12 summers old stayed high
Weed connoisseur, been rocked designer du'jours
So minor, my persona was formed
No flaws it's federal fucker the cells is tapped
No calls from a devil dude, been to hell and back
So know yours cause I could never just, sell you raps
This is my life laid on wax

[Hook] - second half, repeated 2X

[Hook] - first half

We all evolved from the city of Gods, we all evolved from the city of Gods

Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely

[Bridge]
Yo, this one here
Goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, dog
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin, for her I was feenin
So I had to take a little ride
Back tracking on these few years
Trynna figure out what I do to make it go bad
Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin' and I'm so

[Hook]
Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

[Verse 2]
Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right cause
Without you in my life girl I'm so

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one on the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out, baby)
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin me crazy cause I'm so

Minha vida

[Verso 1]
Minha vida sim, essa Ã© minha vida
Vivo cada dia como se fosse o fim da vida
Brindo a casa, a famÃ­lia, e, eu brindo a vida
Com problemas no dia-a-dia, mas Ã© assim a vida
Pra mim Ã© essa vida
Eu meto o pÃ© na vida
O que eu quiser da vida, vou fazer nessa vida
NÃ£o vou ser um zÃ© na vida
Guerreiro, fÃ© na vida
Viva agora, porque vocÃª nÃ£o leva a vida
VocÃª tem uma vida, entÃ£o cuida da sua vida
Ã€s vezes injusta, mas nÃ£o viva tipo "Poxa vida"
NÃ£o reclama
Aproveita, Ã© tÃ£o curta a vida
Vida breve, vida intensa, entÃ£o curta a vida
IrmÃ£o, siga sÃ£o na vida, louca vida
Mas nÃ£o viva em vÃ£o e nÃ£o viva outra vida
Quando eu morrer sÃ³ fale que ele pos a vida
Em cada obra prima que fica viva depois da vida

[Verso 2]
Minha vida Ã© um clÃ¡ssico!
A vida que eu vivo cada dia
Ã‰ uma pagina escrita num livro
Minha vida
Ã‰ um filme que eu dirijo
Entra em cena, meu cinema atÃ© o fim Ã© ao vivo
Ã‰ um clÃ¡ssico!
Minha vida Ã© tipo um quadro
Que eu pinto com a tinta, Ã© tÃ£o nÃ­tido, Ã© claro
NÃ­tido Ã© claro, Ã© tipo a roda de um carro
Que continua girando atÃ© na hora que eu paro
Ã‰ um clÃ¡ssico!
EntÃ£o eu vivo ao mÃ¡ximo
Quero mais que o bÃ¡sico, eu vivo tÃ£o rÃ¡pido
Se o cÃ©u Ã© o limite, acho que eu sou um pÃ¡ssaro
Porque eu voo e faÃ§o shows todos sÃ¡bados, sexta-feira
Entendeu? Brow, Ã© parte do que eu faÃ§o
E falador, o meu flow Ã© acido
O meu palco Ã© um teatro magico
Onde eu mato mc's contra o C4, trÃ¡gico

[RefrÃ£o 2x]
Bem vindo a minha vida
Bem vindo ao meu show
Espero que vocÃª assista atÃ© o fim
Em uma linha fina, eu sinto que eu tÃ´
Sobrevivendo no inferno ouvindo o Senhor
Eu vivo minha vida, ao vivo vou correr
Des' da linha de partida atÃ© o fim
Junto com a famÃ­lia atÃ© o dia que eu morrer
Um dia minha filha, isso Ã© pra vocÃª![Verse 1]
Brooklyn we go hard
We on the look for the advantage, we work hard
And if we seem to rough it up a bit
We broke but we rich at heart
Pull ourselves up now we won't choke
It's our time, put the lights on us

War tactics they make me sick
Reel your heart in run away with it
Smile in your face, undermine your back
Got guns for the strength they lack
So if you know another way
You can't look the other way
If you know another way
Tell them so right to their face

[Hook]
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine

[Verse 2]
I pay for what's called
Eccentricity and my wish to evolve
I hear them all say
That I got heart
But not everything that it takes

Taint my mind but not my soul
Tell you I got fire
I won't sell it for no payroll
Let 'em hold me down
I know if I know another way
I can't look the other way
I know another way
I'll tell them so right to their face

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spank Rock]
Entirely, totally
Bring it all together, I want everything
If it's in the spills they had gossip that meant
We can't be poor folks waiting on a trickle with your hands out

I got a life that you can call a luck because it was a duty
You don't mean I ain't payin' dues, you stupid fuck
I'm more of a mind for reaching things that you can't
Just know I'm doing something you ain't
Simple and plain

[Hook: Repeats 2 times]
