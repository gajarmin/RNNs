Flossed out in the club while most of y'all fakin'
Ain't no mistakin' how we do it so you gotta show me love
Pop the bottle, crack the blunt and now we smokin' on a dub
Sassy bitch, classy bitch might be on some pimp shit
Where my money nigga, no time for games you got's to dip
Cause I'm a regulator, original game playa
Fuck a ho, I'm Mrs. Captain Save A Nigga Day-a
Nigga playa, own stash off the rip
Make my gun "Blocka-blocka" if a nigga trip
Cause I'm the regular, you ain't no competitor
So back up wack trick, you better duck

This unstoppable bitch don't talk it, she live it

You'll be in the jeep takin' off yo clothes (Uh-huh)
Bitch (Bi-atch!!) make a nigga rich or somethin' (Rich or somethin')
I don't give a fuck you ain't in my clique or nothin' (clique or nothin)
I don't like to cake hoes, I break hoes
It's all about the peso's and I make those
You don't know about the hoes I toss
You don't know about the thangs I floss
Welcome to the land where .44's explode on broke hoes
??? I keep every bitch in broke mode

Hook

[Rasheeda]
Got niggas in my grill like - Whoa!!

Quit the flow, don't even ask, then go on with it
Nasty attitude so you know you can't hit it
Just forget it, I got my mind on my shine
Labeled most hated bitch in 1999
Now it's 2-G, got hoes scared to drop they shit
I'll put my foot off in yo ass and I'll stomp that shit
Lock that shit
Hit the spot and rock that shit
I'm on a mission and you wishin' you could stop my shit
My momma told me "Whatever you do, stack the dough"
Don't ever fall behind no playa hatin' ho
And that's for sho', you got's to be the trillest of the trill
Realest of the real, my nigga what the deal huh?

Brush lames out the way like they did on Apollo (Brush 'em off)
Goodbye, adios amigo

{Hook 2x's}

{Verse 3: Rasheeda}
Now where dem bosses who be raising them kids
Pick 'em up and drop 'em off in your soccer mom whips
Ain't nuttin always paying the bills
So I can rock couture fits from Beverly Hills
Gotta keep the hair and nails fresh
Can play any position, but never the mistress
You can work a 9 to 5 or own your own business
Long as you runnin' shit it never easily impress (fo sho)
Stay in control 24/7
Keep it 100 always trend settin'

Sucka wit the big sack nigga better lay it down

Keep the door open, drivin the ave, mami get in
Matter fact, don't ya come without, whoo, bringin ya friends
One shotgun, three in the back, one on my lap

Open ya mouth hun, "we don't do that", don't give me that
Why ya tongue done, say "aaaaahh", fuck it, that's what I thought
I was peepin that since the first time I saw ya
Timed ya walk from therr (there) to the time I parked
So keep ya one eye open for the haters that gawk

Threw on some new shoes, drop the top and skated out

Call me the hero, better yet, the lieutinent
Takin charge of the game, best believe I'm gon' win it
See, it ain't no thing for me to put it down
You jumpin out your draws for this bitch from down south
Now put 'em up, and throw your hands in the air
Now tip the cup, like you just don't care

Hey lil buddy in the orange and blue

I'm starchy when I take em to the Grammy's
And wipe all over your starchy and fantasy
Smell like candy but taste like sweets
Line of the work from paper to grease
Hey mana lese they flirted with diamonds
My diamonds got diamonds so I'm always shining
The crown full of hollasion must be rocking
Ain't all in the can but I sure be stopping
All on the dance floor while I'm pop locking n dropping
Niggas throwin' 100 dollars in your pocket
I'll woo woo wobble on your face, I'm a park it
Diamond is the name and money is the target (YUP)

{Chorus 2x's}This shit was all I knew, you and me only, I did it all for you, still you were lonely
If we could have worked it out, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved and that person has it all
And your just stuck standing there...
I'm gon need you to say somethin baby
Say say somethin baby, say somethin baby
Say say somethin baby, say somethin baby
Say somethin baby, heyyy say somethin baby ohh

[Nivea:]
Wish I could pull you out the game, cause it's the thing that made you change
It ain't the money honey, lend me some money honey
Thought I was your heart before your black card
You told the world about me but you forgot about me
Is it somethin you forgot cause I'm makin it my adamas watch
And it's beatin like my heart goin tic toc, tic toc
Baby look what u done done got me singin this song

[Nivea: Hook]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only, I did it all for you, still you were lonely
If we could have worked it out, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved and that person has it all
And your just stuck standing there...
I'm gon need you to say somethin baby
Say say somethin baby, say somethin baby
Say say somethin baby, say somethin baby
Say somethin baby, heyyy say somethin baby ohh

[Rasheeda:]
Yo I been grindin so long tryna reach the top of mount I want it all
Rememberin the days window shoppin at the mall
Now I walk in the store blow the whistle and ball
This ain't the picture I painted this is not a Warhol
You was supposed to ride with me but you so far gone
Used to be my biggest fan when I was comin up
Then when I blew up u act like I ain't do enough (damn)
I know I'm not home every night I'm dream chasin shoes laced up extra tight
If anybody understood probably would be you, told me to sacrifice do what I got to do
I never thought this meant sacrificing you, did all this hard labor thinkin we'd enjoy the fruits
I could move on but you still gotta piece of me, when you gonna realize I did this for you and me

[Hook: Nivea]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only, I did it all for you, still you were lonely
If we could have worked it out, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved and that person has it all
And your just stuck standing there...
I'm gon need you to say somethin baby
Say say somethin baby, say somethin baby
Say say somethin baby, say somethin baby
Say somethin baby, heyyy say somethin baby ohhC'mon
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate
Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you

[Verse 1: Petey]
I want them 3, to come up here wit me
So I can put em where they 'pose to be
One at the head, one in the middle
And one down by my feet, she keep ticklin me
Neighbors bangin on the wall cause we over here
Disturbin the peace, baby be easy
Rockin the bed so hard we done kicked off
All tha sheets, don't worry we don't need em
A couple hours in the session we done been
Through bout four CDs (about four CDs)
Keith Sweat, Mary J, Brian McKnight, and Jodeci
(They love Jodeci)
By the way look think I need a couple can of energy drinks

Cuz these hoes go vibratin in they coochie

[Hook 1: 2x]
I like the way yo ass be vibratin...

Make that ass vibrate, make that ass vibrate
Make that ass vibrate, shake that shit till you

[Verse 2: Rasheeda]
Bend over and touch ya toes, blow smoke got ya hoes like you blowin dro
Slide down the pole, upside down do it fast or slow
Round here we professionals, get flexible, real sexual
Make a nigga wanna eat it like a vegetable
When he see that ass rise like a buttered roll
Round here we gangstered out, this ain't no titty bar
We let it all hang out
Break bread till the song played out, show that nigga what a real bitch bout
These cats thank they pimpin like Don Juon
But they all played out like the thong song
Get ya money gul, show em what you really bout
Rasheeda reppin fo the ladies in the south

[Both Hookes]

[Verse 3: Petey]
I can fuck, any bitch in here, lay her on the pillow
Crawl up behind her and cram all of it in her
Ride her ass like a bicycle, hold right there
When I move you move, just like that
Just as show as yo ass is fat, there's some 26 inch rims on a Cadillac
Like spinners, sittin on a sixty-seven
At the car show bumpin Funk Master Flex
I ain't met a bitch yet (and yeah) that I couldn't have
All I gotta do is tell a ho who I am
Pull up to the side and get away from them
Doom, Doom, Doom

[Both Hookes]

[Hook 2] - 2XD-Lo

Hm. That's fo damn sure. Hey, cause I'm a BOSS

{Hook: 2x's}

{Verse 1: Rasheeda}
Google me baby, I'm drivin' 'em crazy
Ya gurl so fly you can call me amazin'
Boss chick, that's the motto
We set shit off, we don't follow
We no gargle, we no swallow
Brush lames out the way like they did on Apollo (Brush 'em off)
Goodbye, adios amigo
I ain't stuck up I got a Kanye ego
Gettin' to this money like my name was Nino

I ain't just talk pimp, this what I stand fo
A independent chick who be stakin' them bank rolls

{Hook 2x's}

{Verse 2: Rasheeda}
I got my own house, I got my own car

Won't catch me slippin, ya gurl stay flossaay  (flossaay)

You already know I ain't settling for less
I'm a Boss Chick, so that means I rock wit da best (C'mon)

{Hook 2x's}

{Verse 3: Rasheeda}
Now where dem bosses who be raising them kids
Pick 'em up and drop 'em off in your soccer mom whips
Ain't nuttin always paying the bills
So I can rock couture fits from Beverly Hills
Gotta keep the hair and nails fresh
Can play any position, but never the mistress
You can work a 9 to 5 or own your own business
Long as you runnin' shit it never easily impress (fo sho)
Stay in control 24/7
Keep it 100 always trend settin'
I deliver like UPS
Cause I'm a muthafuckin B-O-S-S

Verse 2: Que Bo Gold

Naw they don't understand

Verse 3: Re Re

You can tell a real nigga from the fake fake
A trill nigga that's down in the cake cake
A hot girl that's clean not stank stank
Some bad weave for somebody
So u took a little drank
So I guess it made u think that you could when u can't
Wit the N with the ain't
Ain't nobody got time round here to playing round
Sucka wit the big sack nigga better lay it down
Comin' through ain't bout that shady shit
Boy I'm mo' dirty than Dusty Rhodes
I drop the beat and rock the flo'
Representing that Que Bo Gold
So don't you try to test us out thinkin' we country wit no skills
Cuz I drop the bass and tame the bass
Put this fire to yo grill

Verse 4: Rasheeda

Well I was born in Illinois okay ah
Raised in Atlanta, G-A yah
Lived in New York and L.A. yah
My nigga I'm da shit no matter where I stay
Cuz, uh, I wuz cut like that, lil buddy i'm stacked like that
From da front to da side to da back, Rasheeda, and I'm tight like that
I ain't never been worried bout anotha
Cutter her buddy, lil buddy I don't studder
9 double lock chrome for the lame lame
Big faces in my pocket not the chump change
Ride the Benz with the wood grain, grilled out, smoke frame

38 pop pop all you haters just stop
Or you gone get dropped

Hook:

D-S-G-B, Pastor damn Troy
Boy you ain't ready
Boy you don't want it
Boy we ain't ready, bitch get disappointed
Shit, all I know is southern blo'd not lower than a dime
From thirty piece to quarter ki we strictly on da grind
No time to spit no evidence, no evidence, no charge
Since they ain't got no evidence

The scars from my hand as I crank up the speaker
Drop the bomb on you bitches, Pastor and Rasheeda
Bitch, do it!!


Hook:

We gon' dedicate this one to the fellas
Y'all know how we like it
And if you don't
Put your mouth to work
Yeah, ladies, check this out

[Hook]
What's up wit' it, you scared
Put my hands on the back of your head
And keep it there
Don't stop
Lick it up 'till the very last drop
And go down
Don't ya want a taste of this georiga peach
Go down
Don't ya want a taste of this georgia peach

[Verse 1]
First thing's first, Rasheeda
Fuck around with no man that won't eat her
I don't need 'em, ain't tryin' to see 'em
Your momma and daddy, I ain't tryin' to meet 'em
Hallmark cards, ain't tryin' to read 'em
Yeah, I can cook, but I ain't tryin' to feed 'em
Ain't nothin' but this vagina Steven
Your dick little, need your tongue to make it even
Slow down, stop speeding
Your 20 somethin', supposed to been done teething
For real, been 20 minutes, has this nigga stopped breathing
I know he down there and I ain't even seen him
Damn, where he at, there he go
I'm a superwoman so I need a little mo'
And I ain't nothin' like your ho
I ain't gon' cuss you out
I'mma show you to the door

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You on the run, got a federal case
I know a place you can bury your face
Yum yum, go and get you a taste
Gotta shake, let it go like Mase
With your tongue I don't know how to act
From the front all the way to the back
It's therapeutic and it helps me relax
I got them goodies boy get you a snack
I dare a nigga to try to act like he don't want to
Hate when a nigga say what he won't do
You're talkin' to a girl standin' on her own two
If I wanna I can do it with my own two
So you gotta work it, do some tongue tricks
It takes dedication, I don't cum quick
So put your shoulders in it, catch a neck cramp
Cause I gotta give it to 'em like a wet stamp

[Hook]

[Bridge x4]
Where he at, where he at
There he go, there he go
Real girls make them boys get low

[Hook](Talking)
2001, we bout to show ya'll how we do it
Once again, this Rasheeda, and I'm introducin'

We can get it on, let me come a lil' closer
Freakin' all night long, makin' love until we're over
???, lemme know what you wanna do
Tell me that it's on, so that we can get it on

(Verse 1)
I been around the world, no more for me to see
I stay on the roll, lifestyle celebrity
My time to shine and it ain't easy as it seems
To do what it takes to keep a nigga on my team
2 Way page me cuz I'm neva at the crib
Just to keep in touch, that's how a nigga gotta live
I know you know how to keep this thang tight
I'm out doin' me, so I ain't with you every night
It's easy to see, baby I meant to be yo wife
But I can't slow down, nigga I got my own life
So get on in, when you fit in, don't trip
I stack the dough, I run this shit, got you lovin' this
Life a luxury, and you wouldn't have nothin' if it wasn't for me
I'm headed back to the States, flight land at 8
Typin' "I miss you too, and I can hardly wait"

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I'm on the next first class flight late night to get to you
Sippin' trippin' offa the things that we can do like...
Whoa... nooo, keep it on the low
Those the thangs I won't let nobody know
First thangs first, how you like to whip?
Platinum CL5, 2002, ???
Be ready to dip soon as my plane touch down
I only got two days, so we gots to lay it down
You know how we do, in the Dirty, we live it up
When I get to the crib, ain't no frontin', give it up
*We're landing in Atlanta* so itz time to crank it up
We get on the round lil' man say back it up
I'm lookin' around, there you are just like you saw
Ain't got no ???, headin' straight to the car
We dippin' my ride that's keepin' da real dub
Rasheeda, believe that you bout to get rimmed up

Repeat Chorus

(Talking)
Back in the A-Town this is how we ride
Me and you stay down cuz we do or die
Everybody be hatin' like we Bonnie and Clyde
Intellecual thug, the only nigga by my side

(Verse 3)
Between me and you let's keep it one on one
Check them hoez on the side before them bitches get done
Got no time for the games, I'm collectin' more change
And flip it to bills so we can take it long range
You know what it is, and how it's gon be
Everywhere that you go, you comin' right back to she
I'm makin' it known for all these hoez to see
They already know that you belong to me
That's why they stay mad, just wishin'
That they could have everything that I own
The thang and the man, my love, my nigga, my hustla team
Niggas ??? we layin', you my ghetto dream

Ya know?
But when they see you outside in your six
Then they wanna holla at you

Girl when I first saw your face
I said to myself
She's like the kind of girl who only looks out for herself
And from the moment you walked up
I peeped your game
Your like the kind of girl who give it up
Because of my name

1 - If you be straight up
About what you want
Maybe we can hook something up
But I ain't gon front

2 - I won't be the one chasin'
No baby
I ain't gon be the on
To fall in love, I can't
I won't be the one slippin', no slippin'
Girl forget it
I won't be the one trickin, no spendin
I ain't the one

Girl when I first heard about you
I said to myself
She'll only hang around
As long as you keep cash on the shelf
She wants to live the glamorous life
But I don't need (a girl like) her in my life

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 (2x)

[Rasheeda]

What you gon do, you really don't know

And when the hit cha they think they gon' get richer
We gotta let the niggas know
Check It out

[Verse 1: Rasheeda] + {Nandi}
I take a minute to get in it, let this game unfold
Who put Atlanta on the map and now we're platinum and gold?
Now who contendin' with these heavyweights (flow for flow)?
Who got yo nigga actin' single at my {sold out show}?
Been in the game runnin' game, nigga {know that}
And seen the tightest to the lame niggas {fall flat}
These streets is watchin' all you paid niggas {so don't chat}
With all them fed time laid niggas {naw, now fuck that}
You won't be rimmed up and hemmed up, nigga, fo' sho
This major paper got you feelin' like you in control
Take a minute, think about it, need to slow your roll
Lost your focus, hocus pocus, you done {sold your soul}
For some small change, mind frame got too swoll'
Before you know it you gon' blow it, nigga {no mo' dough}
For some small change, mind frame got too swoll'
Before you know it you gon' blow it, nigga {no mo' dough}

[Chorus: Bone Crusher] + [Rasheeda & Nandi]
(Bone) Ra Ra Ra Rasheeda don't trust dat ho, don't fuck wit dat bitch

I'm comin after you {blastin wit the clip in da plate}
Do what I gotta do {my nigga makin no mistakes} Yo!
Me and my girls ridin shotgun 'bout 10 deep
Cambleton road game told on da late nite creep
While I'm trippin figgas missin know I counted it too
Now only hoes who was touchin money was da ones in my crew
{Now think about) Is it the bitch in the 6 behind
The one I took under my wing and treated like she was mine
Raised her up {she came up}
I put her flow on fire
Gave her da game and da fame thinkin I could retire

[Nandi]
I had the crew with the downest bitches
They fall in da stackin riches
I knew that I should have listened
To my womens intuitions
But y'all ain't keep positions
Now y'all wanna make decisons
I'll have y'all ho hittin switches
Pidgeons and turns the switches

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Rasheeda] + {Nandi}
Better watch dem ho's who's down wit cha
Plottin' to get cha and when they hit cha
Think they gonna get richer
Picture me {shoppin' sprees} tearin' up da mall
Lil' sista feelin' richer lettin all y'all ball
If you wanna get it got it shawty down for yours
Round trip oversea's on my worldwide tour
You was like my lil homie 2 step behind
Never thinkin' for a minute dat you would scheme on mine
Knew it from the jump should have got it crunk, but still
Had my mind on my shine lettin' all y'all chill
{Now tell me} Who was da one who had you livin' this life
How the hell you gon' ??? gave you the ice
Laced you nigga with my figgas just because he was nice
If I knew then what I knew now I would have thought 2 about it
Doubt it; now y'all ho's is cut
Gonna throw your life away you gotta trick to keep up

[Chorus] - repeat 2X[Hook]
(Jazzy Phae)
Every time we hit the club the shit's off da chain
Better believe it shawty
I'm at the bar callin' yo name
Squeekin', big ballin', flossin'
(Rasheeda)
See me in the club nigga - iced out
Or meet me at the bar shawty - let's ball out
Ohh you's a big money nigga - who goes all out
Well let's do this damn thang till we - fall out

[Rasheeda]
Niggas say I'm too hype and hoes hate cause they flaw
This number one rap bitch spittin' nothin' but the raw
You menstruatin', frustrated, keep yo most anticipated
Flossed out in the club while most of y'all fakin'
Ain't no mistakin' how we do it so you gotta show me love
Pop the bottle, crack the blunt and now we smokin' on a dub
Sassy bitch, classy bitch might be on some pimp shit
Where my money nigga, no time for games you got's to dip
Cause I'm a regulator, original game playa
Fuck a ho, I'm Mrs. Captain Save A Nigga Day-a
Nigga playa, own stash off the rip
Make my gun "Blocka-blocka" if a nigga trip
Cause I'm the regular, you ain't no competitor
So back up wack trick, you better duck
Rasheeda world and I take it how I give it
This unstoppable bitch don't talk it, she live it

Hook

[Jazzy Phae]
This ice tray wrapped around my wrist - Look at me!!
Gettin' hi as hell, drunk as a bitch - Look at me!!
Man I'm feelin' like a million bucks - Look at me!!
Niggas hatin' but I don't give a fuck - Please believe it
I push a Jag 2-G sittin' on some O's (Sittin' on some O's)
Bitches be up on my dick like brand new clothes (Like brand new clothes)
I wanna be seen with you up in the Pocono's (No)
You'll be in the jeep takin' off yo clothes (Uh-huh)
Bitch (Bi-atch!!) make a nigga rich or somethin' (Rich or somethin')
I don't give a fuck you ain't in my clique or nothin' (clique or nothin)
I don't like to cake hoes, I break hoes
It's all about the peso's and I make those
You don't know about the hoes I toss
You don't know about the thangs I floss
Welcome to the land where .44's explode on broke hoes
??? I keep every bitch in broke mode

Hook

[Rasheeda]
Got niggas in my grill like - Whoa!!
Cause I rock a show the club outta Control!!
Boy you want the digits, I told him hell No!!
Cause you got the 4, I got the S-50-50!!
Quit the flow, don't even ask, then go on with it
Nasty attitude so you know you can't hit it
Just forget it, I got my mind on my shine
Labeled most hated bitch in 1999
Now it's 2-G, got hoes scared to drop they shit
I'll put my foot off in yo ass and I'll stomp that shit
Lock that shit
Hit the spot and rock that shit
I'm on a mission and you wishin' you could stop my shit
My momma told me "Whatever you do, stack the dough"
Don't ever fall behind no playa hatin' ho
And that's for sho', you got's to be the trillest of the trill
Realest of the real, my nigga what the deal huh?

[Rasheeda:]
Sometime love feels so good
Sometime love feels so great
Sometime love turns to hate
That's when it's all gone and it's just too late
I thought you was different from them other dudes
I've tried so hard to hold on with you
Yep by a minute I played a fool
I even let you sleep by with a lie or two
See I was your chic I ride for you
If I can't get down to it I ride for you
It took a little time for me to shake you off
Cause night and days I should break you off
Boy pack yo bags, take your game
Go with them lies you ain't gon change
I thought what we had together was so strong
But there are pictures on my phone that prove me so wrong

[Kalenna:]

[Rasheeda:]
Let a slide with the business trips
Got a name of a credit card slip
Man, why you're going out like this
I've never thought I'd have to deal with this
I look back and it all makes sense
Late night hanging out with ya boys
So now you're too drunk to drive home from the club
Why you didn't call me I would scooped you up
But you're sendin out all my calls and voice mails
Where your blackberry at – you get my e-mails
Now you're gonna sit here lie in my face
Shoulda cheated on you and gave you a daze
But I didn't do that I thought real love was better than all that
You the reason women think me ain't shit
You'll never find another real chic like this

[Kalenna:]
Boy pack ya bags

I ain't nothin like ya ho

Show ya to the door, show ya to the door
Show ya to the door, I'ma show ya to the door
I ain't nothin like ya ho
I ain't gon cuss ya out I'ma show ya to the door

[Verse 1]
I ain't pickin up da phone, I ain't answering no emails
You know why and you know the details
Walkin in my door lying in my face
That's why I'm through with ya and you 'bout to be replaced
I asked you about it you act like it was business
But you huggin her and kissin her, walking through Lenox
Yean try to hide it, yean care about my feelings
Game over now its my turn to deal it
No good ass give me all my keys
Don't forget to drop the watch and the chain before you leave (before you leave)
I ain't goin for it see that door now walk
I'll be damned if you leavin in the car that I bought (car that I bought)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't gon fuss, I ain't gon cuss
Imma take ya off my credit cards and burn yo clothes up
Every word out ya mouth be a lie, lie, lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye bye
Let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya
Our only memories gon be a Myspace picture
Cause you erase, your gone, you're dismissed
Understand I'm da wrong one to fuck with
Stop beggin boy it ain't a good look
This chapter here's done, I done closed that book (closed that book)
I hope you happy with dat ho
It won't be long before she show yo ass to the door (HA HA HA HA)

[Hook]

You's a lie, lie lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye, bye (bye bye)

You's a lie, lie, lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye, bye (bye, bye)

You's a lie, lie, lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye, bye (bye, bye)

You's a lie, lie, lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye, bye (bye, bye)Hahahahaha...
Oh we better have some fun with this one, Frost, okay?
This is just entertainment, people
Y'all ready for this?
Okay

[ Chorus 2x ]
Take 'em to the bank, take 'em, take 'em to the bank
Take 'em to the bank, take 'em, take 'em to the bank
You actin Hollywood like yo ass don't stank
Don't hesitate, take 'em, take 'em to the bank

[ VERSE 1: Rasheeda ]
Get in where you fit in, hit him where it hurts
Sometimes it's all about gettin what you deserve
That deadbeat baby daddy shit is for the birds
Givin years of your life and gettin nothin in return?
But stop, all my ladies, can you feel me?
Some we give the benefit, and some we drain empty
Why you think Kim keep havin little Diddy?
If she gotta cash a check she gon' get plenty
Got a question how to get it, better ask Shaq wife
She know how to stash, she know how to give advice
But don't cause too much drama
Or you gon' end up like 50 Cent baby mama

[ Chorus 2x ]

[ VERSE 2: Rasheeda ]
Okay, I gotta take my hat off to Russell
He put Kimora on a multi-million dollar hustle
Speakin of that hustle, the mama ain't trust her
I wonder what that girl Tameka gon' do with Usher (Yeah now)
I heard somebody 'bout to get T-Pain (Shortay)
Now is it me or do Janet got mo' than Jermaine? (Y'all know what this is)
Can't forget about Trina and Lil Wayne (Weezy baby)
She got him for some change and a 12 carat ring
Nelly tried to give Ashanti Brass Knuckles, she ain't want 'em
She rather walk away ownin half of Apple Bottoms (Dirrty)
6 years down, 7 'bout to come up
I wonder if Jay and B signed a pre-nup (It's your boy)

[ Chorus 2x ]

[ VERSE 3: Rasheeda ]
Check it out, just in case your situation different
You better watch out for how Bobby did Whitney
Or Kevin did Britney or J.Lo and Chris
I ain't down with that pay-a-man-alimony shit
Look at Bob J, the first black man with a billion
He had to give his ex-wife 400 million
I bet that's why Oprah ain't marry Stedman
She ain't 'bout to give up half of what she been gettin
It could be a secret like Mariah and Cannon
Hold your money tight cause he still a adolescent
They wasn't lyin when they said we got a secret weapon
That made me realize bein a woman is a blessin

[ Chorus 2x ]He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over
And touch my toes

Them boys in the club always looking for a blockhead
Y'all the same ones givin' up non-stop
So get it right before you step to me rugged
I like them brands, betta rip on them cookies
I gotta have that dough
I like the hit (???) cuz I'm a jazzy...(girl)
This fit that I'm fittin' cost more than them 24s
If you gotta ask, you can't afford what it's hittin' for
I change rides more than some of y'all change clothes
It's so hot, but yet the wrists is so cold
One to the head, two more to get me loose
Once I hit the floor you can blame it on the Grey Goose

He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over
And touch my toes (x4)

Antique jeans with the stones on the booty
Ghetto fabulous in the club, give it to me
I like to lean and pop, I like to jig and stop
It take a lot to get this bunny to hop
Got 'em lined up like (???)
My bank account on the rise, like Wal-Mart stock
Boys get it straight, I know you wanna see me touch my toes
With this mini skirt on, I can strike a fine pose
He droolin' at the mouth like he 4 months old
Here's a teethin' ring to bite, just to keep your grill closed
One thing for certain, two things for sho
I know you wanna see me do my thing on the floor

He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over
And touch my toes (x4)

He all in my ear sayin' I look like a model
Steady poppin' game when he should be buyin' bottles
I ain't a golddigger boy, but I got needs
I'm on some presidential shit and I ain't talkin' bout trees
Girls in my hood like boys with fat pockets
Straight drop game, and he know how to lock it
The new R-class benz, he already knew it
I ain't gotta ask for it, he just do it do it do it
I know what real money look like, and you ain't
Girl, don't never touch them toes 'til you verify the bank
Bottom line, if you wanna play with these toys
Do away with the games and bring the damn noise

He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over
And touch my toes (x4)
