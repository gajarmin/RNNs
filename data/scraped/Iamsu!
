[Verse: 1 RJ]
Huhh look
Niggas rap rich but I been broke
Last night I had a dream bout a kicked doe'
I used to cross state lines just to get dope
Wanna press my line gotta fish for it
I'm all alone in a crowd don't touch me, smoking I'm frustrated
Lie to my girl & she bring it up months later
Nah I ain't a ho i just crush a lot
Ball soft re rock til' I whip the watch
Mustard hit me from the yacht drunk laughing at chop
They said it's grind time a gang of niggas want yo spot
Look, a gang of these new niggas wanna be Pac
That's why a gang of these lil' niggas gone get shot
It's hard to grow up
Niggas ain't fucking with you so what
Sit yo ass down get ya dough up
I don't ever judge with my nose up
Ima blow uppppppp, Oooooh about money on that note
Bitch I'm 100 to the point you get taxed for it
If I ever need ya hand I'll ask for it, until then Ima be on my shit like

[Chorus x2]
Ooooooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you
And I'mma be richer than you, I'mma get rich like
Oooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you, and I'mma be richer than you, cuz I’m on my shit like..

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Ooooh Ooooh Ooh, I'ma be richer than you
Two or three bitches came through, I'm tryna fuck something
I told her back back it up for a Young G
Remember hoes used to call a nigga ugly
Two chains on mouth full of gold teeth
OG Chiefed up, try me n' get creased up
Couldn't make the cut even with a knife on
So bad had to hit it with the lights on
Body like a stallion, I'm finna take her home
She told me keep that shit a secret, just for me to know
She got an ass so fat I gotta hold that
I'ma throw this money on it no tax
You can quote that, sign sincerely yours
I swear I grind all the time make me need it more

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Choice]
And we never going back so I know it's clear
Call to tell her every night so I know it's there
Only find truth in your account and in your mirror
Counting checks cause I'm deaf nigga Kobe stare
Ooh the pussy so tight I had to claim her
Got yo deal on yo side fail call Kramer
Danger, Dying is cheap living ain't free
Niggas is cool but niggas ain't me
AP whippin' the jury til the court come
Get to the millions as a civilian gotta be worth something
I only like bitches who go and find bitches they all getting fined even when they find bitches
10 Summers like a motherfucking shy sentence
You ain't getting business girl stay out my business
Why would they sit and ignore calls from niggas
Don't call us back or broke richer than all y'all niggas it's Razor...

[Chorus x2][Verse 1: IamSu]
Ape shit, I go ape shit on every beat
Took my ass on the road
Sold out every seat
Hip hop is diabetic, these niggas is very sweet
Need a steel casket if you finna bury me
Cause I'm hard, H A R to the D
I'm the God listen to the Lord when he speak
Young Su, no not for super unique
But a double suplex is what I do to a beat

[Hook: P-Lo]
They hatin' on me can't stop
I'mma take it, take it to the top

Like a giant Glock, bitch got high then she made her booty drop
While I watch it like the cops, do the niggas in the hood

Concealing big D, she gon take it like a crook
Just make one thing understood

Word to my nigga double A, everybody's under me
Make bitches come, anda, ¡Ándale!
When I’m digging in that skeezer, no soda – that squeezer

Well it's pretty much illuminated
Ain't it, you niggas hate it
Why you tryna  act like you don't fuck with King Wavy
Why you tryna  act like you don't think that I'm amazing
Super Duper Kyle but I never do the saving
Curly haired girls go ahead go crazy
Had AP English so the flow is never basic
Every time you see my face, just know you niggas have to face it (That sucks)
Please tell your girlfriends and cameras to back up
I make hits to back to back to back up
Super Duper Kyle is really good rapper
Shoot like the nigga name Kyle on the Raptors
Rappers worst nightmare ever since Napster
You ain't really gonna hit it if you gotta ask em'
That's why I don't need to ask em'
Cuz I already know the answer

[Pre-Hook: Kyle]
It's lit, It's lit

In the brand new preme, bape, did hopping out a spaceship
Shawty got a tab on her, I'ma watch her take trips
Hit her with a light, damn
Eight o' clock tab that's a night cab
And I got her rolling off the molly
All about the money
I was off the henny in Ohio, I lost my Versace
Shawty straight from Trini & Tobago
She should have a halo, she my angel, Filipino fuego
Out in San Diego making payroll, every day tho
She can't say no, plus I like her hot potato

Imma take her to the bay tho
Hey I might take her to San Fran
Cuz a young nigga that based

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

Woke up to that paper, that paper I'm chasin'
Peddle to the metal for the cash, I be racin'
Suzy six speedin', no there ain't no replacement
Smoke like a Rasta or Haitian, Jamaican
Girls goin' crazy, they need more security
Fresh up out exotic shadow ready for the jewelry
2015, got my mind on a trillion
I won't go away cause my swag too resilient
Keep the bullshit, I got my own lane
Treat the rap game like the dope game
She know me by my alias not my whole name
She just know the bracelet match both chains
God damn, shot nothin' but the net
HBK, I'mma represent
Don't say shit, nigga cut the check
All I really wanna do is flex
And you know what I do

[Hook: IamSu!]

Pullin' up, double R on the rear, license plate say I don't care
Walkin' round up in Times Square, they said son you a millionaire
And my son a millionaire
Snakes cut no grass so I gas brown drink
Large bank in my LK tank
Fucked around and stripped the breaks
Got Picassos in the safe
Bracelet like a lake, Suzy pump the base

Spillin' bands on my boosts

Real life Dipset, girl I really mean it
Still ridin' round like I'm broke
Still with your girl on the low
Everybody see me on the hype
No (?) bitch, I need it in my life
Pull up to a bumper like a parallel park
Shining so hard you could see me in the dark
Grass cuttin', no snakes in my yard
Hope my haters keep a special place in their heart for me
God damn, shot nothin' but the net
HBK, I'mma represent
Don't say shit nigga, just cut the check

People looking at me like I was chosen
You know the big dog gotta keep dosing
Every day I get it in, shit, I just win
Bitch, I'm 100 grand, ten racks time ten
You kiss ass and I don't follow that trend
Chop on decks, send whoever you wanna send
The realer game, I'm doing charade
If you ain't bringing money to the table you can vacate
You'll be up the whole night staring in the ice box
I'll be making deals buyin shares at the right stop
I'm a cool cat, I don't really like cops
In and out the jail, making bail, bitch, my life hot!

Diamond lane real on it, fast car
Wood on the dashboard, all about the cash board
Make the money fast forward, make it bitch give me that like I ask for it
Treat the hood like Nascar, exotic whip trunk in the front bad boy
Elephants in the room, pretty with pretty goons
Flip the script with direct shots like Beanie Boom
Fuck that where the bitches at
No big buildings but down town is where your bitches go
Little Compton ass nigga with the vicious flow
Niggas careers, bout to do where the dishes go

Tell these straight things I'm about, I'm about riches and bitches
I'm about being the sickest, cause niggas know I'm the realest
Suzzie on the beat he knew I was gonna fill it
He knew I was gonna kill it, I whip chamber it with it
He put me against the best of MVP every time
They want these hot rhymes, they're killing in every line
These niggas rap good, but these niggas really lying
We're seeing these cash money, now niggas is big timing
We're fucking with my cash, man you're fucking with your life
I ain't saying I'm a thief, but a nigga fuck your wife

These niggas won’t hold me back
These niggas won’t hold me back
Check your sources, check your facts
You lames get no respect in rap
I pull up in that extra black
Baddest bitch right next to that
Driver seat she ride with me
I probably won’t text her back
Writing on my iPad, stunting on your jive ads
Niggas broke down on the road, I just drive past
Extra slow, extra smoke
These niggas is extra broke
All about my green, so I always eat my vegetables
It’s that extra special flow
Young extraterrestrial
Young, but I’m professional
Don’t believe me, stretch with no
HBK the gang
I’m so dangerous with all these change I blow
Don’t trip off no bitch
Because these hoes is interchangeable
They know me, every place i go, i be on vacation so
Much like I'm  retired, man
I’m higher than a plane could go
Cliché I know, may I go?
More in debt, stucy sweats
Gold teeth, Olympic 6’s
I don’t taking in  winning steps
I been a threat, since the 6th grade
Niggas get paid in the Rich, moved out
But I still remember it
Too legit, hammer time
Puff hat, camouflage
Run the game, damn I’m tired
Turn me up, amplifier
Hotter than a camping fire
Cannabis to Mary Blige, plenty
Giving fashion tips, slim fits, over skinnies
I don’t wear no griffies, yeah I got a afro
Like the black folk in the 60’s
Tell me if you with me, maybe we go further
Eating niggas beefing, I ain’t never had no burger
Waiting on that merger, finna to get that cake
All these hoes screaming for me,  like a nigga drake
Niggas hating on me
They act like a nigga fake
See a nigga eating
Try to steal off of my plate

[Hook: Rossi] (x2)
My feet clear coming
Drop down, riding round, everyday I hold it down
We don’t do no fronting, now no baking on my drive now
Drop down, riding round, everyday I hold it down
We don’t do no fronting, now no baking on my stop now[Produced by Prophet]

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Don't act like you ain't seen me in this party lookin' right, baby
Don't fight the feelings that you have for me tonight
Cause we're grown, baby, you know it
Want it but you just won't show it
Eyes glued to me like you're slow motion
Got you hooked on my potion, baby

[Hook: Kehlani]
I'ma act a fool with it
You know I had to act a fool with it

Eyes glued to me like slow motion
I got you jumped on my potion, baby

[Hook: Kehlani]

[Verse 3: IamSu!]

That'll take you to the store, tell her "Pick what you want"
So uh, go ahead and act up, Imma throw this stack up
I'm always holdin' down the Bay, that's where I get my mack from
When I hit it Imma kill it, that's fatal attraction
She want a G up in her unit like I'm Curtis Jackson
And I'll teach you how to stunt
Rich city nigga, diamonds in my gold fronts
I'm lookin' at her once and then she rollin' up a blunt
She say she comin' to the Bay and she ain't comin' home for months
Now she goin' dumb
And she know she got a goal every time she come
She wanna turn into a bro, I'ma make her one
And I stack a lot of dough, I'ma make a ton
Money maker do the fool, you know this your one

[Hook: Kehlani](Intro: IamSU!)
Uh
HVK, yeah, you know how we play
Yep, Yep

(Verse 1: IamSU!)
Stay true, plenty changed on the way
But it still HB to the K
I'm from the bottom of the bottom of the bottom
And whatever it is, all my homies whilin'
You could feelin my vision, sayin' I'm on the way
All the way in the New Wap
And though I still hold it for the Bay
Still hold it down for the Rich
Hold it down for my fam'
Tell the world 'bout my movement
Let 'em know who I am
Represent like I should, keep it real to the core
Ho about the money, I'm screaming give me more
I'm peeving down to the floor, I'm buying Jordans for fun
Finna take over the world
And give it all to my son
Telling me I'm the one so I'm second to none
Barely learning to fly, it's only just begun
I'm on like the street lights, so they tell me go in
I learn from my old head, don't fix it if it's broken
My girl so way she soakin', and I want every drop
On my way to the mountain and I will never stop

[Hook: IamSU!]
All I rep is that gang
HBK, yeah, you know how we play
All I rep is that gang
And I can't quit, all i know is gang shit
All I rep is that game
HBK, Yeah you know how we play
All I rep is that game
And I can't quit, all i know is gang shit

(Verse 2: IamSU!)
Came up faster than helium
Too trill, ain't nobody realer than, them
And cook, coke,flow you can call Villimin
Phoney never ever realla feel this is realer than
Young and wild how I hustle
I always knew by the grind just to apply every muscle
And this is what it comes to
Real niggas out the struggle
On the bubble
Tryin' to maintain and just stay about the trouble
On the double
Shit it hard, but really tell me what's easy
Coming where we come from, it was hard to believe it
I seen it in the dream, so I gotta get it by any means

[Hook][Hook: IamSu!]
Came up from the bottom
All I had was grind
For the love of the homies
Put it all on the line (x5)
For the love, nigga!

[Verse 1: IamSu!)
Hold up, got this Bay shit sewed up
Kush rolled up
Young nigga, money grown up
Startin' to think I'm one of the realest niggas breathin'
Open the door and then I let the whole team in
I can turn your boy into the man
I can turn a grown ass nigga 'to a fan
Livin' in the present I won't take this shit for granted
Why it seem like everything works out to my advantage?
Like I said it, then I did it, like I planned it
I go stupid, hear a beat and I do damage
Like Total Impact, send shots and they get sent back
It's HBK for life, the whole crew we intact
Up all night, no rest, you know we workin'
They can't call my next move, gotta update they service
No Metro, on a jet though, finna rock out, Depeche Mode
And I'm constantly chasin' the money you probably find me wherever the check go
Biatch!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Skipper]
Come from rich city by the way
Got that wet too, got the bitches goin' cray
One thing about me, I'mma always get that cake
And I never gave a fuck what a nigga gotta say, okay
Bitch just flew back from L.A
Shorty seen the wave, got her wetter than a lake
I done earned my spot, so you know I'm here to stay
And I guess without a limit I [?]
Better pop that safe when I rock that club
Comin' from the city where they cook a [?]
I be gettin' to the commas, you got baby mamma drama
Hop up out the whip, that shit be clouded like a sauna
Still do it for the love, never givin' up
Even when I'm gone, go beyond and above
Started from the bottom but I never been a scrub
Got the power in my hands like a motherfuckin' plug
Real nigga shit
Skipper

[Hook][Verse]
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
So fuck following whoever decided to leave
God’s be Rocky at the top of the steps
Give everything I have in me, til it’s nothing left
A man’s defined by his words, quiet as its kept
Keep your third eye open, no paying intercept
Son, what’s the meaning of life?
Trying to stick to the code, I’m not being right
Uh, so one can be a sign
Feels like everybody around me is living a lie
Enough water that I could drown in the tears of my eyes
Wanna make the world a little better, before my demise
Feel like the gap is getting longer, the higher I climb
Having to put myself right again time after time
Line after line I’m elevating the collective conscious
Skipped over college, took my tuition, I made a direct deposit
Into the school of hard knocks, Im majoring in my dreams
And now my wallet is so big that it can fit in my jeans
God, family and music, won’t let the shit intervene
I had a dream when I was younger, I was winning that ring
I had to switch up my roster, switch up my mantra
Hard to stay humble when they’re praising you at concerts
Stupid, occupied so I divide up my attention
Thought she wanted me to blow, how you can’t do with my ascension

I thought you loved me!
(I do love you!)
I thought... I thought you were the one for me
(Baby, I’m the one for you I know it!)
Like, forever!
(i want this shit forever)
What happened?

(I don’t know, I was tripping
I was on the, I was on the bullshit like
The insecurities in my mind just kept working in
It’s was just the bitches and the I don’t even know...
I was trippin please
It doesn’t even matter like
You’re all I want, I’m sorry love!
Wait no, come back
Don’t, don’t walk away from me!
Cause I need you ...)

(I love you
Im sorry please I'm not good without you
Dont leave me)

I, I thought you loved me
I thought you love me!
You said
I thought you loved me!
I thought you loved me!
No, no, no, it’s not love, no![Verse 1: IamSu!]
Put my trust in my brothers, listened to what my momma said
Made my moves undercover, stayed away from what drama is
All the while we've been bubbling, hustling to bring them commas in
So many people coming, promising empty promises

[Bridge: IamSu!]
These niggas be tryna' dress
I be in designer shit
Cut that shit im not impressed
Look at who you rhyming with
All my homies real as fuck
All your homies counterfeit
Label tryna' jerry yes
But we not allowing it

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Need a mill just to listen, so to spill my position
I'm colder than whoever won't take my girl out to kiss her
So you think I care? Hell no. Might bend but dont break, elbow
Ya'll believe in these rappers, but its those that im after
Im addicted to stunting buying kicks till im casper
That till im gone, ill outlast them
Every song is an eargasm, cause I open my mind
My words of your imagination
Su baby!

[Hook: IamSu!]
Trying to do my thing, right off a dream
Haters they try to hold but thank god I got wings
So this song is what I sing, putting on for my team
Promise that I'mma get it, get it by any means
I'mma follow this road as far as it goes
I'mma follow this road as far as it goes

[Verse 3: Hollywood Keefy]
I asked the bay and the game what they gon' take me as
They see me as a mill but never let them break me fast
Stay prepared for repair so i got the right tools
Its not about the truth we in the game where ice rules
And these hoes choose all over status
But how the fuck we looking [?]
When we search for the baddest
Infatuated with the lights and all the women that's with it
You see these niggas rocking with you
Then turn cold as a blizzard
Its like, your real niggas
And them other niggas
And now them other niggas is just other niggas
So I stay lifted and try to show you the ways
And I'm running on open ground but its feeling just like a maze
My brother is was what you was
But you turned into some shit we wasn't
Felt like you was my fam but now you some bitches cousin
So I just spread my wings I'm going up like an airlift
And its rare for me to not be on some epic shit

[Hook][Intro]
I need you (x8)

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
Hbk the gang
Nothin' like these other lames
Flow hot, bet I get her wet like the summer rain
Gold teeth, wrist and chain
Brand new everything
You got what it take to hang with the Sudi Mane
They wanna know where I been, what I'm into
Keep a new pair everyday like a gym shoe
You can't stop us, don't even attempt to
Rap tight, plus the beat slap like a pimp do
Uh, when she with you she wanna check her phone
Lemme be the Doc, lemme run and check up on her
Game tight like I mack, tell her check the tone
Weed loud in the crowd like a megaphone
Yeah, on stage they be beggin' for me
Tell lil' baby no panties under leggings for me
So I could see her shake that ass
I'ma teach her how to flip that (?)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck ‘em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ahhh! Aye babe this my new shit
I'm the black Richie Rich with the roof missing
If it don't make dollars it don't make sense
Z, wake up like I gotta get it
And I got a engine for a trunk space
I get money three ways, fucking bitches three ways
7 different foreigns plus she no hablé
But I make that bitch walk with some cheesecake
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Looking in the mirror like I wish I could be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hobby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'mma eat it, I'mma eat it
I don't lie, hold my dick, too conceited
Uh, told her she's my wife for the weekend
But don't be acting like I need you cause we poppin' like

[Hook: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo

But don't be acting like I need you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm in a Royce, you don't roll right
My chain shine brighter than a strobe light
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
If I motorboat, she gon' motorbike
A nigga ain't worried about nothin'
Rehabilitation just had me worried about fucking
Money, decision-making only worried about stunting
She worried about me, her nigga worried about cuffing
I wanna see her body (bodyyyy)
She said get inside of me
I wanna feel you baby (yeahhh)
Just bring the animal right out of me
We loving, she love it
Especially when I go down on her
Now we fucking, she thugging
Getting loud (cause we poppin' like)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo

We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & (Tyga)]
Huh, look, alright
Now I can spot your bitch from a mile away
Valentine in that pussy, it's a holiday
(Uh, you losing money, I windmills Dr. J
She going to follow my lead, Simon Says)
Paper, paper, I'm riding scrapers in California
Car smelling like ammonia, we got that stank on us
(Never been an outcast that stank on ya
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia)
We in the hood, tatted like a Mexican
Car too fast, give a fuck about pedestrians
(And my section less niggas, more lesbians)
Got your bitch, I'm that nigga
(Yeah we poppin' like)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down

I'm just a young nigga with a promise future
I gotta get this dough, nigga, no excuses
You wasn't really real, it was nice to knew you
Told God I'm only bout that real he said, "hallelujah"
Take my time but it's coming in fast though
My new chick better than my last ho
Getting money I could put your mans on it
Don't talk about it, drop bands on it
I can turn your bitch into a fan, homie
Young nigga hot, put a fan on me
I'm the man homie, I'm the man homie
Young nigga hot, put a fan on me
She said I got a couple friends just like me
They from the bay, hella' thick and get hyphy
Twelve months all about the cash flip
Bet that money make her do a back flip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
It's YG 4 hunnid, I got a question to ask
Would you suck dick, fuck dick and lick balls for that hang bag
Would you let me run a train up and pay your car note
If it was due tomorrow?
If you would strictly dickly would you let a bitch lick your pussy and titties, would you?
Would you fuck me then fuck my homies, you really love me though
But he was gonna' give you that mutt
She just tryna' take care of hers, she a real bitch
But if you had a baby daughter, would you still strip?
She just tryna' get rid of that stress so every question I asked she said "yeah", aye

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Aw man, baby girl a model or a actress

You know she just want some satisfaction
Make her bend it over then I smacked it
I can tell that she really attracted
Run that too, man, my brody tagged it
Three hoes on me but I'm only one man
I'm faded off Patron, yeah I'm in my zone

Girl you know what's up, I beat the pussy up

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I bet that money make her do a backflip
A hunnid' grand, I had to do gymnastics
But I ain't got no cash up on my plastic
They tell me I'm a real legend in this rap shit
But lets get back to this whack shit
This backflip got them girls gettin' rachet
She brought two hoes with her, that's a hat trick
I'm runnin' circles, run them hoes like a track bitch
I had to pick her up in my newest ride
The newest guy, out L.A, I stay super fly
The coupe in drive, dollar (?) on the west side
She bring that pussy straight to me, that's suicide
I'm still in the hood, I did this verse in Inglewood
With a model doing things she said she never would
I live the life these other niggas wish they could
But I gotta thank God cause I'm living good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm pullin' up clean in a classic
I only smoke weed, nigga, that’s it
Just left a bad bitch for a badder bitch
A million dollars make it look average
Hold up, I got KK to roll up
My bank like a pay day, they go nuts
I pour up, we slow down, they go down like mayday
That's your girl she chose up, I hit it, her legs wide, she glo up
Bet the money make her do
Just seen another 20 mill, I'm tryna make it to it
I ain't even runnin' game, told her roll a plane
Girl that basic training for the game, hope you make it through it
I'mma go hard on a bitch, I'mma do my thing do my job
I'mma hit from the window, to the wall
I'mma make you go Dominic Dawes on the dick
You know I'm talkin' 'bout?

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I was in the (?) with your boy (?)
Got a couple girls, won't you hit it with that Fergie style?
I been up cause I'm on that New York time
Hustle hard cause I'm on that New York grind
I been runnin' all day, in the studio for two weeks straight
Now it's time to play, 'bout to meet a couple cuties at Earth Cafe
I'm bout to have some cappuccino with some bitches, you know
I swear to God this bitch is lying, say her cousin's Cee-Lo
She talkin' 'bout how she be singing with these different people
And how Breezy wanna see her but keep it on the le-low
And I'm like, uh-huh, bitch you're lying just hop up on this fat dick
Baby you like it raw like I'm a dirty boss (?)
Take them panties off and I'mma make that pussy pop bitch

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
Bet the money make her do a backflip
It's (?) season, it's a wrap for all that whack shit
Out of state women like my accent
I need a R&B single like a Mac-10
You know the homies got it, never lackin'
Made a million of this independent rappin'
We gon' sell it all, we gon' get it back then
HB game gang, team captain
Faded off Patron, she won't leave me alone
The money make her backflip, she never going home
She dippin' in the dust and make that body rush
Girl, you know what's up

[Hook][Hook]
Right back on your mind
That's forever no that's never gonna die
Right back on your mind, back on your mind
I stay on my grind
That's forever no that's never gonna die
I stay on my grind, I stay on my grind

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Back on your mind
I love the cash and I say that all the time
I been on my G, since Lil Wayne put out 500 Degreez
You want a show bro you gonna have to pay me
Don't need a whip until I get my money
You know that's all I believe
We in this bitch I swear to god we won't leave
I love my squad love my team
Don't love these hoes but I'm in love with the pink
Sometimes I sit back and think
Why everybody know me when I walk in the bank
And this still ain't a game
Never scared of you niggas and we still ain't afraid
Cause we still around the bay
They can hate if they want but we don't care what they say
Cause I'm

[Verse 2: Skipper]
Yep, got my gang in this bitch

The Picasso of Rap
Suzy played me a banger and I said that's a wrap
Yep, I'm that nigga with juice
Take her back to the crib that bitch know just what to do
I'm pulling up out the lot in something missing a roof
They tell that it's impossible I'm living the proof

Bare leg got your bitch getting loose
Haters saying it ain't fair now they calling it truce
On the grind all the time make her do what it do
Oh, Skipper

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool John]
I threw a party and I'm selling it out
It ain't about money then I make her reroute
You talking rap I'm the best of them out
My cash is getting straighter like I measured it out
I heard your bitch was a dick pleaser
I make her knees crumble like bread pieces
The Uber picking us up, my flow is super deluxe
Got stupid kicks like I'm chuck
And I'm fresh off tour with a bitch by the shore
All the liquor get em poured up
You smell the weed in my pours
And I'm fucking all the whores in the party
And it's going up
A rap stars version of the black card
Jumped so many hurdles could have been a track star
Fucking around in my BMW
With Su and P, with 3 old dubs (Yee!)

[Hook][Verse 1: Smoovie Baby]
Champagne bottles by the case load
Shake tail ho only cuz I say so

And if it ain't a hundred I don't want it
I see 'em in my Instagram comments
Bet I make these haters sick 'til they vomit
All family, no friends
Fuck with me, you wanna win
Go to work, go to work on 'em
Finna go crazy, go berzerk on 'em
Aye, had to run my check up
Only time I take a L is in a Lexus
Sippin' brown got me flexed up
And my OG say I'm next up
Take her to the room, pull her dress up
Bitch, you need bandz to impress us

Young Sensei, muy caliente

Hella bands, got like noodles and shrimp
You don't want my shit, bananas like a chimp

If she wanna see broke, I see rich
If she wanna see fly, I see fall
Tell lil' baby let me ball, let me ball
Let's make a bet I get a bitch and get a check
Get a game and get a pussy, that's a threat
Loaded, I be lit
If you hatin' on me, you a bitch
Look how much work, I got work, I got work

Look how much work, I got work, I got work
Like twerk, twerk, twerk

[Hook: Jay Ant][Chrous from Anita Baker's ' Your The Best Thing Yet']
Best thing yet
To ever come into my life, life
Ohhh

[Verse: IamSu!]
Livin' under stars, tryna shine like them
Bumpin' the College Dropout, tryna rhyme like him
Bumpin' Aftermath shit, tryna rhyme like Em
Drinkin' until I'm bent like a duck bill brim
I wanna be the greatest, I don't know how to say this
But I would die before I'd be the one that didn't make it
Starin' in the mirror tryna find a deeper meaning
Of why I beat the sun, hung on morning and the evening
Cause I'm star gazin', tryna figure out how you got there
The top blare, Jay-Z, no Rockwell
But I keep a bad beat with me
The same ones that starved with me finna eat with me
The same ones that came with me finna leave with me
It sounds simple but got complicated recently
Cause you take a lot of losses, tryna be a winner
Climbin' up the ladder of success with no splinters
It's hard but it's real
I'm from where people die just to live
So I give my whole heart in the real
Just to spark the young mind of a kid
To do it big like Frank White, swagged up, game tight
I just wanna shine and give all of ya'll the same light back
So when I'm on stage doing my thing
Apply that to your life man, hah

[Bridge]
Best thing yet
To ever come into my life, life

[Outro: Kool John]
Yeah
You already  know who it is
The one and only
Mis Shmoop Obama, David Huffer and Kool John
Living that Shmoop life, um
God works in mysterious ways
I always found the beauty in growth
Seeing the process of growing  nothing to something
Is truly amazing
God blessed me with a vision
To forsee things, I knew, you know
I knew, all I had to do was folow my intuection
And apply myself
And it would get me to where I wanna be
You know, It go a couple years back
You know what I'm saying
When Iamsu and I
We were going to the same GM college
He was giving me a ride to work
Cause I had car problems, And
I remember him  explaining to me that he did music
Um, so me being a music head lover and a music head
You know, I did my research and dug him up
Um, i instantly copped the rhyming
And came across some IamSu freestyles
I couldn't believe what I was hearing
I was like my young nigga out here
Really like tearing up tracks and shit
Like that, like, he better than any nigga out here right now
Major niggas, professional niggas and even undergound niggas
I was like, eh, eh man, I gotta heear more of this bro
I gotta here more, so i came
I became more interested
What you doing with this music shit
So he invited me to Chief House, you know
One of his buddies, he had a little studio
Set up in his bedroom
And I started coming over and hanging around
And listen to these original tracks,that IamSu was recording
And producing himself  and you know
He had  his other you know, his  fellow producers
Invasion Beats, P-Lo, Kuya and Chief, you know what I mean
I was just, like, crazy, like, like,woah
Like these guys are developing  a new sound
That I ain't never heard before
And, um, I even became more amazed, you know what I'm saying
The talent, that this young man, possessed, you know what I'm saying
Consistent quality, and the music he was making, you know what I'm saying
IAnd around that time I was throwing these parties across Shmop fest
I was throwing this little promotional company called Equippy Cool thing promotions
And wanted to climb the youth of promotional skills
Seeing something grow form the ground up
So, I'm listening to these IamSu tracks
And I'm just puzzled and baffled at the fact that
No, Nobody knwos at this time, the individual existed, you know what I'm saying
So, from then on
I was like, I'm gonna do whatever in my power to help this guy get started, you know what I'm saying
So, I got as many blank CD's  as I can
It was probably like 8 discs
I told him, I'm gonna get you in these streets
So, I make sure everyone I know, know about you, you know what I'm saying
So, so I know a lot of people and you know
A lot of people come and ask me, you know what I'm saying
Yo, you got any  more mixes?
Cause you make these dope party mixes
And these dope slow slow jam mixes
I started putting 'Su on the playlist
And they like , you know
And they wanted to start catching on
So, you know, And um
And from then on, this is one talented young man
This nigga can really rap, you know
You know what I'm saying
Who is this nigga?
You know what I'm saying
You know I wanted to convince everyone
You know what I'm saying
That he was the future
And I want them to see what I see
So, I see he future in this style
I see the future in his rap and his beats
You know what I'm saying
ANd everyone, you now
Like I thought they would catch on
You know what I'm saying
I'm seeing IamSu grow and transform  into the greatest artist
Each  project, you know what I'm saying
He getting better and better  and um
And it became motivating and inspiring
You know what I'm saying,you know what I'm saying
I literally seen, no one was fucking with him
To him being the man now,you know what I'm saying
And, um, I've seen him apply himself
And you know and ur
And watch him move and grow infront of my eyes
So that I knew I could do the same, you know what I'm saying
He kept his fans and teams loyal
And kept his fans tight
And all that shit, and ur
I was really happy to see a young man doing that for himself, you know what I'm saying
And to go after what he love and to take his music seriously
Now, you know
Now here we are, couple years later ,you know
IamSu's the hottest and the world is noticing his art
And all I can say is, I knew
You know what I'm saying, I knew

[Musical Interlude][Hook: IamSu!]
We don't like broke bitches
We don't like brown weed
Stay up out of my business
You don't know about me
We don't like broke bitches
We don't like brown weed
Stay up out of my business
You don't know about me

[Verse 1: Jay Ant]
I'm rarer than unicorn hair
Get more back than lawn chairs
How we do it it's not fair
But I do not give a fuck I don't care
Bitch I'm a player ho
Shout to my nigga Roach
I been playing so long fucking I should probably just be a coach
You should see how I run the play
I can't help it I'm from the Bay
That's the only way I was raised
That's the only was I was laced
Tell her run it huh, but this ain't a race
I'm drinking Jameson straight bitch I don't need a chase
If she ain't fucking with me then I ain't finna chase
I'm just trying to pentrate I told her let me demonstrate
What's happening
I'm ready for whatever we counting feti together
Bitch I'm smooth as new leather get on your head like New Era
Fly niggas without feathers
And we only move the cheddar uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: IamSu]
I'm stranger, blessed like Christ in a manger
Anger bottled up on me, created a company
Heart Break collision all state
Potentially failing, a risk that we all take
A criminal mind state is what these rappers got
And when it comes to money, I think I spend a lot
Rot, in hell if you hating I'm from the home of the
Raiders A's and the Giants Black Panthers and many more
I remember when, I was plenty poor
Made my life to a thick bitch from a skinny whore
More present than Christmas
All this hate I will dismiss
Disable like pop-ups, no money you lost us
You steady selling your soul that's cause it don't cost much
Watch them fall off like Mufasa

[Lion King sample]

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Berner]
Bitch, go and get your ends up
Kush smoke, flowing out the benz truck
Two shows, I'ma need ten plus
Come through suck me and my friends up
Money, light blue pills and a bunny
The Bombay gin got me dancing all funny
Pull me in the back and let me play with your mouth
I'm in the lap dance booth and I ain't breading her out
I get ratchet, leave town overnight of baggage
I'm blowing on cookie, way out in Kansas
Ask around town boy I really get down
Shit I smoke by the pound, boy I keep me some loud
I with them HBK boys P-Lo and Su
Yeah I'm good with pack plus I'm sweet in the booth
I got a mouthpiece chill make a freak bitch choose
Cartier frames with the LV suit

[Hook: P-Lo]
I be rolling through the city I be riding
Big bad benz bad bitches on the side
I get that dough, bitch you know my neck stay froze
I'm out here getting these O's, aye
I'ma boss man, never care whats it's costing
Touching green like boston
I'm a motherfucking boss man, boss man boss man

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
All I got left is a dollar bill
Guess I'm back to the ATM
Ugh, pull out the max
Go back to the club, take her back pull out some tracks
We make club security nervous
I show up with so many real niggas and they ain't searching
Ten bitches in a suburban
They ask me why I loving so many I say I deserve it
Reporting live from the trap, all partners in the whip with a board on my lap
Whole city on my back
Get this shit like kitty litter niggas don't know how to act, uhh
Young Suzy the Don Gato, when I slide through everybody wanna holla
Don't call unless its money
From the home of the hyphy but I ain't nothing near a dummy
Suzy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P-Lo]
Young P-Lo yeah I ride around
Pretty bitches big money on my side of town
Balling at the gym while you outta bounds
Rolling through the hood you don't hear a sound
I'm a young motherfucker and I'm faded
Couple mixed bitches getting naked go crazy
You ain't talking money I don't hear that shit
Unless you throw the pussy at me I'ma kill that shit
All the Gangster, Pimps, Players, Hustlers
Balling at the club make bitches wanna touch us
You already know I'm a fucking boss
I's stayed dotted, T's forever crossed
Bitches wanna get involved, we don't talk in bed at all
I'ma boss man ho I set it off
Getting money like a sedative
Fucking with the gang ho your better off

[Hook][Hook: Problem & Wiz Khalifa]
Worried bout a hater? Not me
Turnt to the max, no sleep
Smoke a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Rollin', pockets swollen
Ridin' in it, like its stolen
Weeded, hella conceited
If it ain't about money nigga I don't need it
Got a hundred grand in my ashtray
Spend a hundred k on a bad day
And I'm tatted like a cholo
Nigga act crazy my dogs go loco
Kush got me movin' slo-mo
With my nigga Problem that's my bro-bro
Came in through the back door
Ten mill this year on the low-low
And I'm still smokin' pre-rolleds
Cristal, done fucking with the Clicquot
And my bank full of zeros
Young Wizzle get fly like a hero

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Problem]
Rollin' through with them hoes like a donut
Sold more weed than you G's ever smoked up
Dick make her choke up, like a real ?
Got me feeling like a mill, off a pill door locked
We ain't lettin' all no more bros in
But fo' sho' we'll let y'all hoes in
Cause when we pullin' money out they be lovin' it
Give her dick 'fore I give a bitch my government
That's eight, I got eight more
Super duper high, eighty-eighth floor
Unzip this, that's eight more
Fuck a pussy and fuck rhyming
We gon' live forever, fuck dying
Get it 'til I drop, fuck tryin'
Pedal to the metal, we flyin'
In the fast lane, yellin' Diamond

[Hook]

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Everything about me
Young wild nigga, mouth full of gold teeth
Treatin' bape.com like a swap meet
Going crazy on a bitch until she knock-kneed
I'm in a hella fast whip going top speed
Make a mess in that pussy and then she mop clean
I drop racks and she drops jeans
Smoke green as I lean, top dropping
Nigga I am all about a buck falling out a truck
Prolly with some hoes that I just met and yeah, they all gon' fuck
Got her man callin' up her homies, blowin' all em up
Trying to figure out where his girl is, she probably toasted
Like a champagne glass
So much money that ain't a damn thing sad
Do my damn thing in my campaign add
Let's get straight to it, don't let a damn thing pass
Nigga what?

[Hook]Six
Duck ass, jive ass, turkey ass
Fraud ass, dog ass, lyin' ass
Clown ass, punk ass, mark ass, bitch ass
Niggas

[Hook]
Don't try to play me man, cause I ain't with that shit
Slobbin' on my knob, my name she can't forget
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man it's bussin'
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man we bussin'

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
Man you trippin' niggas love it when I gas up
I cross my heart and hope to live through the bad stuff
Now lift your shirt, I wanna see your rib
That pussy fat what you be feeding it? I'm back up on the scene again
You never catch me lacking, never happen, never will
You put that pussy on the pedestal and pet it still
You got the game wrong, you need to brainstorm
I'm on a campaign, titties and champagne with us
If you ever see us poppin' in yo section
Big ass diamond ring but I ain't pop a bitch the question, huh
She say she wit the shits
If you by yourself I ain't wit that shit

[Interlude]
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
In case you forget, I ain't wit that shit

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Baby girl, fell in love wit the whip game
Type of money make a young chick go insane
Jacket fifteen hundred, get it when I want it
Spend it cause I got it, smash it in the morning
She know I'm the prince of the west side
It gas her up, yet she leave with her head high
Japanese denim, yea I'm wit it
European whippin'
I look like I could be from somewhere overseas
Get down on your knees
You messin' with some cool kids slash niggas from the streets
That mean don't play no games
Don't waste my time
Don't say no names

[Hook]

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Timb boots with the sweatpants, do the jet dance
Used to call us monkeys, now they call me Bape man
Suzy, Anna gold chains like I'm MC Hammer
Chicken shack on Burban St. out in Louisiana
Paid dues, I just rep where I was raised fool
Lame dudes duplicate my wave like a wave pool
Stay solid, gold teeth with the 12 solids
White and yellow gold, it look crazy when I'm smilin'
Barney's shoppin', Marcelo coppin'
What you think I'm fallin' off, it's not an option
Me and Mikey know we not straight outta Compton
But we some niggas with some attitudes about to profit
Ya heard me

[Hook][Verse 1]
It's that gang, gang
That Heartbreak that bang, bang
That Rich city shit
Right 'cross that bridge from San Fran
Kid game like Can-can
Gas full, no engine
Old heads need to retire
Give them they pension
I'm chillin, I'm sipping
No blooding, No crippin'
Put the killer in the air
Make me feel a little better
Let me cough a little bitter
Make my eyes a little redder
Too real, that's how we describe each other
HBK, recognise me brother
Don't jive me brother
In the studio is where you find me brother
Top-fivin'
This rhyming
Being unsigned and
Don't really matter where I'm at
Come sign me
Need a few for it
Need a true story
Need a penthouse
Need a few stories
Need a few glories
A few bad bitches
Thinkin' about what you would do
If you had riches
Do with this livin'
Would you  be selfish?
Or would you be givin'
No pretendin'
Doug, we finished
Killed shit, ended
Get that bread, like we printed
Could extend it
Bust no recourse or premissin'
Bruh, we winning

[Hook]
Doug, we here  (Doug, we here)
Like we present (Like we present)
Made mistakes (Made mistakes)
Learned my lesson (Learned my lesson)
Got my head straight and my pants sagg
Where the Oxymoron?
You was sleepin' on me and I catched you snoring
Want stop 'til I cop the foreign
Makin' music, if I'm not recording
Work schedule, I cannot be dormant
Not be touring, not be grindin'
Turn the light on and put my lime in
In the limelight
I want hindsight
Always point 20 vision
I be Einstein
My minds eye will paint a picture
Be careful about who's withcha
And who's against ya
My crew could end ya
Reject your order
Return to sender
Retrurn to blenders
Chop niggas like
Like chop nigga like
Tell me when to stop, nigga like
Take it to the top, nigga righht
Uh, uh

Oh

[Interlude]
And I'm trippy out of my mind

She text me all night long
Tryna come thru with her friends

Uh, hardly home but I’m always on
Lift your problems and  call my phone
I’m balling out, these lames out here all stallling out
Niggas ain’t all about the money now
When honestly, it’s what this shit is all about
Up all night like a waffle house
All this shit that I’m dropping out, that I’m popping out
Her chest popping out
And her draws falling, I’m Jordan balling
I’m Phil Jackson, I’m play calling, quarterbacking
Won the mac like ?? her draws off
And that ho can’t keep her paws of ,uh

[Hook]
I’m too real you can check the difference,uh
And all my players chest is pimping
Ah, I ball out then collect the interest, yaeh
And if you real then you respect the sentence
Ball, farther, don’t worry carter, work smarter
I took the dam and go farther, I took the dam and go farther
Farther, don’t work harder, work smarter
I took the dam and go farther, I took the dam and go farther, yeah

Niggas know I’m next to blow, uh
Extra swagger, extra soul
Love women, no respect for hoes
Uh, the club is open but my sex is closed, yeah
Live my life cause nothing’s given
I wake up taking the me in vists
Was broke now everyday is Christmas, right
I’m from the Rich, where niggas hate to visit, uh
Uh, I’m at the door and they don’t say who is it

I know I got it and I’m staying with it
Uh, I kick her out, she prolly laying with it, right

This shit for us, there ain’t no hating with it,uh
The time is now, there ain’t no waiting with it,uh

[Hook]
