[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
Yeah, this right here, tell me why
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved, c'mon, check it out

[Verse 1]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream, that's right
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath, half your breath
I know you still livin' your life, after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life, after death

[Refrain]

[Interlude: Faith Evans]
Somebody tell me why
On that morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

[Outro: 112]
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
[Puff] Every day that passes
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] Is a day that I get closer
[Puff] To seeing you again
Every night I pray, every step I take
[Puff] We miss you B.I.G., and we won't stop
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] Cause we can't stop... that's right
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] We miss you B.I.G[Intro: Sauce Money]
Ayo, Jay, word up. These mothafuckas fucking talking that comeback shit like they cooking crack. Shit, I ain't fronting, all I want my pockets green like slum change, you know what I'm saying? Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, mothafucka, for real, with no trace of age. We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga

[Verse 1: Sauce Money]
We patting down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

[Hook: Fat Joe]
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I CREAM, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on in
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs
Dividends flow like the Mississippi Riv' looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fire no trigger straight up, shoot my guns horizontal
Get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds, you're barely a hundred and 25 grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Jaz]
Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvegnugen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness ma√±ana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

[Hook][Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it, like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big moved
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the Larkin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct
Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops
You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX
If this rap shit don't work niggas still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggas can't deny it
Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline
Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'mma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga
Ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X
Ruffryder you heard? We got the game mastered

I told you the pain was comin
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggas on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference? Either way I'm sonnin' your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggas comin to lose
Somethin to prove? Spit it, we can have a sprayoff
I lay off wack niggas and kill em on my day off
Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a mil stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin
For you Phil Jackson niggas on that Bull shit

[Verse 5: Styles P]
I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas
Shootin backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket
Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you
I tell niggas quick, suck dick and get a Glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I Ruff Ryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella screamin
Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella

[Verse 6: Jay-Z]
I know pop you can't stand us cause we cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brained in the four dot six Range
Shit main, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain
Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses
We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-classes
Iceberg sweats with I.B. on the elastic
Shit, beyotch! What the fuck, ya heard me?
Put some more beat on that joint[JAY Z: Intro]
Everything must be addressed though
You know?
Nothing slides
Word up
It's murda
Dead or alive

[JAY Z: Verse 1]
My skills are and will remain ahead of you guys
And ain't nothing gon' change that (dead or alive)
Any ill feelings I harbor y'all can blame it on the vibe
Don't know when to let go and let young souls die
Cause niggas dissing me ain't nothing new understand
But it's how I retaliate which defines who I am
Jay Z, ain't nothing dead or alive playing me
I take beef to the grave that's how my momma raised me
She told me "fight in your afterlife, never revamp your story"
So heaven or hell niggas better have some answers for me
Hollering shit from 89, Hawaiian Sophie
God damn y'all been on my dick a long time
(It's Murda!)

[Sauce Money: Verse 2]
Welcome to the terrordome
You error prone niggas sick
RocAFella click thick as herron bones
What legends are made of
Like whenever accurates hit
My voice locked behind bars to a bid for this spectacular shit
Fake kids fold and lie, holding why?
Saw a half a million sales with a golden eye
Patrol the sky to see bucks
GS the fucks Yukon GMC trucks
Slugs ease the pain to your brain when thugs squeeze
More we stuck in, bust shots till we chuckin'
You saw the faggot let em know more could have it
Automatic rhyme spot 4 shot towards his attic

[Both: Hook]
It's murda
Dead or alive

[JAY Z: Verse 3]
If it's jewels you like
You fools gonna fuck around and lose your life
And I just bruise your wife
Don't get it confused right cause we in the spotlight
Still I hold the Glock with the wrist twist like these
Gangsta shit no thanks to shit
Niggas selling a million records more banks to split
JAY Z motherfucka who you think this is?
Introduction Sauce motherfuckin crank this shit

[Sauce Money: Verse 4]
I heard his body was too hot to get near it
Too late to hear it
Two slugs wait to release his spirit
The known truth: had a bad habit for blowing loot
Two niggas on the roof busting down on the phone booth
Running for cover at point blank cause bullets is hovering
Drug them in after the slug went in
I take a phrase in God we trust it's a must
Live by the gun die by the same shit you bust
Fly bitches with waves from DC to Cali
Rally and tally up my dough for the grand finale
Grapevines throughout the alley unknown figures said
Trigger lead knew how bad we needed the nigga dead
Thoughts of hating sober intoxicated minds is taking over
Conjure all ways escape closer
Never spar drove the car to the edge of the tar
With intentions to scar, shooting motherfuckas to Allah[Sauce Money]
I lay my gun fine, ideas be as bright as the sunshine
Shook the rap game with just one line
When me and my niggas combine, all day, you know what?
Sometimes, I run with mad niggas who done time
Hit you with eight, from one nine, now you showin the vein
My shells is like information, go in your brain
Holdin my slug, before you squeeze em show em the love
Burn your fingertips so throw em a glove, understand me
Before my album drop, cop the Grammy, uncanny
Bought my first Role' from Manny
Dirty burners my crew never hand me, nigga we family
You not, get shot, get caught slippin like Dexter Manley
With at least ten lead, spray right, paint your skin red
Damn we, all the shit you can't be
We big time, you small time, real small like how an ant be
Marcy, bust a shot for Metcalf, Tilo and Danny
Peace to the Bureils, Cut Wop and Stanley
Boom Moet and bow, my whole set is wild
Past threats, frontin flash singles and that's bent
Fuck a bitch, you know the drill
Cut a check or suck a dick

[Jay-Z]
Jigga, what the fuck?
As a youth explosively, clappin off the roof
Shootin guard like Kobe, raised up slay smears and bo'e
Back then, Gil was my co-d, Spanish Jose
Showed me how to get the money niggas owed me
Fast forward, no kids, six cars and three Role's
Two cribs, trips to Cuba, sippin on Ooba
Got rap in a stupor, first to clap your group up
From the Range with the ski rack, or six with the roof up
Shit, I light the motherfuckin soundproof booth up
New shit, y'all say the same shit like you're looped up
Your rap's all lazy, Jigga the Black Scorcese
What your album lack is more Jay-Z
Code name: Jay-hovah, all praise me
Y'all don't paint pictures, y'all all trace me
You've yet to see the day when my squad be done
I represent that shit nigga, Marcy son, what?

[Sauce Money]
I grab my dick in front of your bitch, screaming "Fuck your spot"
Heat miser, anything I ever touch was hot
Sauce watching all ya wildcats flop, sound greasy
One song on your whole CD, making my job easy
Figured as much though, got your hustle swinging
Cop a muzzle, then y'all got the nerve to drop a double?
Everybody ain't big nigga, everybody can't flow like Jigg Nigga
Bitch niggas listen: No sorrow tomorrow if you swallow hollow-points
Like a dread in the weed spot, I'mma move some joints
I ain't playing, these BK slugs spraying
Mute niggas could tell you how nice I am, it goes without saying
Malicious, rap flow vicious, stack dough
Bitches suckin' dicks, they fat boy delicious
Pretentious niggas get it in slow-mo
Kodak couldn't picture that, so X-ray machines taking your team photo
Niggas switching like a homo, shit on your team
Fuck how they feel, get all that CREAM
Here comes the drama, here's the drummer, they call your number
And now your fun-filled summer filled with bounty hunters
If a bitch fuck you for free, cats will kill you for the same fee
Think niggas give a fuck what your name be? Or your raw crew?
Kid you're all saw-through
Mad cause you ain't blow yet, never fret nigga your bitch blew for you
Get on some prince shit like, "I truly adore you"
Never, crab cat, fuck you, have that
Sauce mother F-U tricks all in the mix
300 large on my flat up in the sticks
Nothing but a lot of leg room, my son and my bitch
Getting fatter of salmon, croquets and grits
Peace to all my niggas in Marcy, Viya Schmidt and Bits [?]
L-channel henny and crime, nigga which?
One of y'all in the mirror looking facing them 8's
One in your helmet, might induce a case of the shakes
B-scott, what the deal son? Reno where the dro at?
Sauce Money
You know that, nigga{***Jay-Z , (Sauce)***}

Jay-Z talking: Sauce mothafuckin, jigga, jigga feel this...

This goes out (to my Brooklyn crew)...[Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk, I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatchin', jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or somethin'

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
Phase one of the take over, the break's over
Nigga, I'm the God MC, me, Jay-hovah
Shit knockin, almost a crime, get Cochran
Bangin' to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They wanna see me pay, *motherfuckers* better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

[Verse 2: Wais]
We celebrate this, while you sittin back screamin you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spittin sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just givin facelifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Ceasar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start *shit*? My style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you wanna see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in Hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm Resident Evil, movin like ?

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Millionaire that flow like water, rap *niggas* runnin
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the Mac at ya, *niggas* caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't *fuck* widdit
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets Tecs honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on *niggas* like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was lookin you found us
Movin with speed, tried to play Superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Parapalegic, precise minds like the Pharoah's of Egypt
Shot through a barrel *niggas* narrowly weaved it
Keepin my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16's
Bulgin out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holdin, ? shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it...

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, *niggas* hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways, Aim better
Than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire
"Show Me The Money" like Clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zonin
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foamin
White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
*Niggas* is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seekin, grill huntin, still frontin?
Keep squeezin, *fuck it*, I leave the whole street wheezing
No *motherfuckers* hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Geyeah, there you have it
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours
Roc-a-Fella family(Intro)(Sauce Money + Ras Kass + Sheek Louch)
(S) What we going to do right we going to start this mother fucker of in
Brooklyn best style you heard me
(R) (Sauce mother fuckin)
(S) Then I am going to past it to my nigga and we going to swing over to the
Y.o. you know
(R)(SL) (Ruff ryder style)(Sheek Louch)
(S) Then we going to pass it to my other nigga and we going to do it west
Side style you know
(R) (West side)

[Verse One: Sauce Money]
I spit solely for the guacamole
Come through and make a rapper do a back flip rock a rolly and
Reach for my Glock slowly if you try to interfere on how I stack chips
I take chicks to the tele just a happy fan
Now she wanna get a glimpse of my magic hand
She said she like the way it stretch out like plastic man
Sauce money tell me where would you have it land
Told shorty look I got to get back to my grands
Hurry up I am in the rush like jackie chan
Married woman, single or engaged, hood rats still got them to creep
Now we rock them to sleep
Because we got the best songs that pesese charm
Besides if you tricky you just chance head strong
Rappers better respect dons and ex-cons
And keep your vest on this is how we speak with teflon

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo it's Sheek Louch nigga and I will pop till y'all gone
Only thing I knew niggas popped and it's gone
And y'all might pop shit but that's about it
What you know about guns that come out my sleeve
And bullets that fly around your head like bee's
That will hit you and leave holes the size of pee's jes
When I flow it's like tae-kwon-doe
On some do-jo and it just a hobby
How fuck Daniel-san going to beat Mr. Miyagi
Wax on wax off with a knock out or better
I leave three through the E of your Enyce sweater
What pop shit and I am first day delivery
Straight threw your chest pope on your block
In a big brown truck like I am ups
And I don't know about y'all that re-up real small
You don't spend more then a thousand at the mall
If you owe sheek pay me I don't care how you hit me
It don't race me if your car don't cost more then fifty
I'm that cat that threatens on y'all mc's
With a devil flow that will pop your rosary beeds
I from where bitches that know about cooking up coke
Bring ever gram back and keep heat by the twat
That will blend in perfect in a deminacan spot
Now it's me that nigga that shine like glitter
And I must say dogg I am a hell of a spitter
We finish things y'all hell of a quiters

[Verse Three: Ras Kass]
I spit from the genitals bitch, leave 'em masculine skinch
Got niggas panackin, petro and penanican flinch
Grew a mechanical inch the root of all evil
Green theft and green spray with a tech but we can't all eat thow
Cause y'all fethal, we run lethal, homicide victims of Fairfax and Pico
Sugar nobody is ever equal [why] cause the more we make
The more we taking from other people
Livin in puerto rico padarin LAX to JFK
At baggage claim with three hoes like Santa's day
My third eye be the equivilant to the album red pie
So I give you a piece of my mind, just multiply times infinite
Spiritual elevate so I high commite drive bye's while I sky dive
Sip on my time perform shit only concieved in sci-fi so why try test
It's boom bye bye Mr. Ice real guy
You must have been looking some where else like biggie smalls lazy eye
Pop sicker then your average Acquired Immune Deficiency Symdrome infected fast

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
We don't care where your from nigga east or west
And we don't care what you wear we don't aim for the vest
It's lox, sauce and Ras Kass three of the best
Only niggas with money we don't fuck with the rest
We don't care where your from nigga east or west
And we don't care what you wear we don't aim for the vest
It's lox, sauce and Ras Kass three of the best
Only niggas with money we don't fuck with the rest ya heard

[Ras Kass]
It's like that nigga and it's always gonna be like that so you peeon as niggas
I got a new word for you y'all niggas boon walk that mean beat it backwards
Fuck out of here nigga the matrix Sheek Louch my nigga Sauce Money Ras Kass
Blaze sky walker nigga the matrix get the fuck out of here"Watch out for your friends"

Aiyo, aiyo, you you you got that thing for me, huh?
You thought I was layin it? No no I ain't layin it, I'm takin it
You don't understand? You confused?
How bout if I stuck your fuckin head thru that window
That would unconfuse you right?
Thought I was layin it, give me the fuckin money, come on

I'm blamin lame ass rappers frontin for famin
I should open up a casino for all the games you playin
I'm sayin, everyday in a different namin
Plus they homos now, big black niggas flamin
We stressin, that you don't be stressin us
And if you GS and GS then don't be B-S'n us
Just be B-S'n logicly, not like that we be guessin
Because the truth need no modesty
Cristal to spring water, Bacardi whatever
What it is is what it is, we can party together
You know how the game goes when your name grows
But still love is love, fuckin the same hoes
Against the grain goes the souped-up rapper, he spittin venom
So now we gotta get wit him
And do the ten thing, frightenin, while his mens cling
Then watch blood extract out his ass like ginseng
It all ends with all of his mens hit
And now our future friendship, strictly forensic
But that's the life we livin, drivin, that's how we driven
Strivin, you must be robbin, cos I ain't giving, shoot ya guns

Now when we bless this, with precise shit
That we suffice with, we keep your mentals lit
Now when we bless this.......
"Watch out..."

I see ya overly concernin, ya insides burnin
Mad at the fact Sauce is earnin, with more niggas than Mark Furman
Ya never learnin learnin, never been so determined
Not to be concerned with ya sermon, wheels of fortune still turnin
Still street caviar remains untouched
For Sauce Money cheeseburger deluxe
Screamin what's the croc's fienin, dough we rake off
While you hailin for cabs we, taxi for take-off
Fake crews and units is dubbin
Get ya whole clan wiped out, no scrubbin
For the description given, chapstick flappin
Pistol-whippin nigga rappin, sell arms to keep em clappin
Gungho chicks squeeze for me, crazy G's for me
To see cheese come easily for me
In the same arenas, ain't gotta state his name, you seen us
Few bundles of dope never came between us
Sippin on Bay Breeze's, now we higher than Venus
Comparin thumbs, tryin to see who's the greenest
High strung, no relief pitcher off my tounge
Ace of the staff, Sauce back-to-back Cy Young

Now when we bless this, with precise shit
That we suffice with, we keep your mentals lit
*repeat x3*

In the club lit, listen to all my niggas hit
Bitches love me for this disrespectful shit
Fuck em, the only thing I'm with is large amounts, clear
Money the only thing that counts here
By any means like Malcolm
X marks the spot, you know the outcome
Income, never outdone
Rap star, hit the stage dipped in tar
Other crews muerto, can't fuck with this concierto
Too fecicous so I drop new releases til your crew deceases
Screw your pieces, fuck your thesis
Fuck your speeches and fuck your beef
Cos when my crew aim, do more than brush your teeth
It'll split your shit, when it hit your shit
If you don't want your shit hit, don't forget your shit
We don't spar, we aimin all niggas to Allah
When it's spent and to the nazarine if ya 85 Percent
Do what I gotta, straight shot of Jack
Amareddo colada for my bitch in the back
Never bluffin, never rap for nothin
Rap flow, don't love it, sincerely yours, Sauce motherfuck it[Intro: Sauce Money]
Ayo, Jay, word up. These mothafuckas fucking talking that comeback shit like they cooking crack. Shit, I ain't fronting, all I want my pockets green like slum change, you know what I'm saying? Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, mothafucka, for real, with no trace of age. We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga

[Verse 1: Sauce Money]
We patting down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

[Hook: Fat Joe]
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I CREAM, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on in
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs
Dividends flow like the Mississippi Riv' looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fire no trigger straight up, shoot my guns horizontal
Get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds, you're barely a hundred and 25 grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Jaz]
Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvegnugen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness ma√±ana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

[Hook][Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk, I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatchin', jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or somethin'

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
Phase one of the take over, the break's over
Nigga, I'm the God MC, me, Jay-hovah
Shit knockin, almost a crime, get Cochran
Bangin' to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They wanna see me pay, *motherfuckers* better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

[Verse 2: Wais]
We celebrate this, while you sittin back screamin you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spittin sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just givin facelifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Ceasar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start *shit*? My style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you wanna see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in Hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm Resident Evil, movin like ?

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Millionaire that flow like water, rap *niggas* runnin
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the Mac at ya, *niggas* caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't *fuck* widdit
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets Tecs honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on *niggas* like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was lookin you found us
Movin with speed, tried to play Superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Parapalegic, precise minds like the Pharoah's of Egypt
Shot through a barrel *niggas* narrowly weaved it
Keepin my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16's
Bulgin out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holdin, ? shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it...

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, *niggas* hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways, Aim better
Than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire
"Show Me The Money" like Clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zonin
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foamin
White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
*Niggas* is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seekin, grill huntin, still frontin?
Keep squeezin, *fuck it*, I leave the whole street wheezing
No *motherfuckers* hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Geyeah, there you have it
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours
Roc-a-Fella family[Sauce Money]
(*Laughing*) Brooklyn
This is the set-off
Kay Sleezy
Take it to the streets nigga
Word up
Sauce Money
Uh, uh
Proper set-off

Don't get it fucked up cuz Sauce calm wit his grandma
Cuz I'm like baking soda bitch, I'm armed with a hammer
And when I'm strapped fool, fuck your brother
Cuz like Jimmy Ivene in Virginia you in the scope like a muthafucka
Fine, niggas don't wanna let him shine
Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin
That if you God body, you can fit the whole sun, moon and star in
You starvin' for more lyrics I know
Steady robbin' all them lyrics I flow
I'm Sadam-ing all you niggas fo sho
You betta know I'm a true nigga, please do nigga
Betta inquire from a few niggas
Cuz bitch, I done shit on quite a few and quieted a few niggas
Get a grip, dead four-fifth in the hip
Slip, never picture me fallin' nigga don't trip

[Killer Mike]
Stoned is the way of my walk
In a mini-mack eleven, the tone when I talk
When I spray niggas pray, lay on the sidewalk
Color blood red, body outlined in chalk
My rhymes, two zigs all nines
Hard hit when they spit, split wigs double time
This eightball's a strict nine
Tear apart body parts when I spark nine
At they head hard lodged in they damn spine
Leaves emcee's like Christopher Reeves, crippled and cryin'
Shittin' in a bag and a breath away from dyin'
Nigga I'm - the epitomy of raw rhymes
The epitomy of rap rock
I make a block party bop to the sounds of a hot Glock
From New York down to Georgia it don't stop
Killer Kill from Addamsville with a hot Glock
Blaaat!

[Bun B]
They say murder is the case they wanna throw me
I guess these muthafuckas don't know me
O.G. rock called a yay slanger
PA's finest
Underground muthafuckin' king call me "Your Highness"
I tear your sinus with this gun powder
Wipe your tears with the steal, no fear this is real niggas
Here is the deal: you clear in this field
And ain't stoppin' until every hater here is revealed
Cuz we don't need no fuckin' clearance to peel
Or shortstoppers runnin' and the fear is revealed
So - get off this block homie handle your corner
Keep all your heroin, rocks and you mariju-wana
I'm like a - character on the Sopranos or the Wire
You'se a - big pussy lil' man, it's over, retire
Cuz the - clock's tickin', your days is done
But we know all them lil' different fuckin' ways you slum
But it's trill downtown, your momma's all free
Your house is sugar-layin' with your wife and your seed
Yes indeed, Big Bun is on a home invasion
You gon' bleed on my gun from your dome abrasions
Cuz my chrome is blazin', I'm naughty crunk
Got the bop gun like Sir Nose D'Voiddoffunk
Bitch, I pull a sawed-off from under the waist
Open your eyes muthafucka, you got thunder to face
Fuck rest, we gon' lay these muthafuckas to waste
You bit the pully nigga tell me, how the fuck did it taste
From my gun...
Big guns, big power
M. Woods, sixth hour
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wesson's, Glocks and lugers
AK's, AR 15's
Mack elevens and M-16's
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it, so you die by it
A muthafuckin' gun...

[WC]
Who's the man with the strap in his hand
Homie's stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day every day, crossin' my hood in day
In a six-trey with my nigga Kay Slay
Dub the law scan, the infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window, hittin' em up with the bandana
And I can't stand a snitch so I - clean the lid
Just in case them bitch niggas wanna sing with this
I stay on the trigger, cuz lames hate me nigga
They can't pay me nigga, where my lay dates nigga
Where AK one-on-one so thirty shot
Nine millimeter Melindas aimed ready to send ya
So put your can on your vest like a Bible and pray slowly
Cuz this'll leave your teflon holey
With the forty Glock ready to ring, bring the trauma to the scene
It's the Ghetto Heisman and the Drama King

[Joe Buddens]
It's about that time nine-milli clappin'
Dude, what's really crackin'?
I been gettin' it since 'Paid In Full' was really happenin'
I gotta do it like that to keep my street name
And pride made me kill Wayne Growe when the heat came
I don't smut but stimulation is good
I keep the hammer with me, Joey's renovatin' the hood
Difference between us, I'm gettin' loot on tours
Good shoes on the Beem, you got a boot on yours
Dudes with no names wanna put an end to me
But doggs, I'm readin' between the lines, the whole game's in parenthesis
Talk about models and how you with somethin'
When you really shootin' air balls, you ain't hittin' nothin'
Nathan, through the strip, O.G.'s blazin'
Street niggas slowly hatin' on Joey so amazin'
And hood niggas knowin' what up
Either holdin' you down or holdin' you up, throwin' it up
Oh!

[Hak Ditty]
Aiiyo, fuck the dumb shit, when the guns spit
One clip'll have your whole strip laid down
Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds
This the ro-yal I ain't playin'
I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider
I keep my block rocker, Glock under the blue dosser
Far as Philly, it's no question to who's liver
I'm hotter, Hak Ditty, block locker
Fully prepared
I hope y'all fully aware that y'all niggas got a problem this year

(*Gunshots*)[JAY Z: Intro]
Everything must be addressed though
You know?
Nothing slides
Word up
It's murda
Dead or alive

[JAY Z: Verse 1]
My skills are and will remain ahead of you guys
And ain't nothing gon' change that (dead or alive)
Any ill feelings I harbor y'all can blame it on the vibe
Don't know when to let go and let young souls die
Cause niggas dissing me ain't nothing new understand
But it's how I retaliate which defines who I am
Jay Z, ain't nothing dead or alive playing me
I take beef to the grave that's how my momma raised me
She told me "fight in your afterlife, never revamp your story"
So heaven or hell niggas better have some answers for me
Hollering shit from 89, Hawaiian Sophie
God damn y'all been on my dick a long time
(It's Murda!)

[Sauce Money: Verse 2]
Welcome to the terrordome
You error prone niggas sick
RocAFella click thick as herron bones
What legends are made of
Like whenever accurates hit
My voice locked behind bars to a bid for this spectacular shit
Fake kids fold and lie, holding why?
Saw a half a million sales with a golden eye
Patrol the sky to see bucks
GS the fucks Yukon GMC trucks
Slugs ease the pain to your brain when thugs squeeze
More we stuck in, bust shots till we chuckin'
You saw the faggot let em know more could have it
Automatic rhyme spot 4 shot towards his attic

[Both: Hook]
It's murda
Dead or alive

[JAY Z: Verse 3]
If it's jewels you like
You fools gonna fuck around and lose your life
And I just bruise your wife
Don't get it confused right cause we in the spotlight
Still I hold the Glock with the wrist twist like these
Gangsta shit no thanks to shit
Niggas selling a million records more banks to split
JAY Z motherfucka who you think this is?
Introduction Sauce motherfuckin crank this shit

[Sauce Money: Verse 4]
I heard his body was too hot to get near it
Too late to hear it
Two slugs wait to release his spirit
The known truth: had a bad habit for blowing loot
Two niggas on the roof busting down on the phone booth
Running for cover at point blank cause bullets is hovering
Drug them in after the slug went in
I take a phrase in God we trust it's a must
Live by the gun die by the same shit you bust
Fly bitches with waves from DC to Cali
Rally and tally up my dough for the grand finale
Grapevines throughout the alley unknown figures said
Trigger lead knew how bad we needed the nigga dead
Thoughts of hating sober intoxicated minds is taking over
Conjure all ways escape closer
Never spar drove the car to the edge of the tar
With intentions to scar, shooting motherfuckas to Allah[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Shit ain‚Äôt gravy, shit ain‚Äôt wavy
Not even close, to copacetic maybe
Dade County dog, little runt with the rabies
Call D-C-F, we drowning these babies
Cuba, Haiti, Voodoo, ladies
Diamonds, rubies, you be, hating
Feel my talents, now you see how my style is
Brutal, malice, the foulest
Gunplay, real name ratchet Moralis
A nigga trigger-finger catching a callus
I go [*snarl/growl*] to all the cats in the alley
Stepping on these rats in my Baileys
With bats in the Caddy
He already not looking shabby; go for the gold
Retriever, labby, torch, G to K, B-X, ain't it?
Triple C, leave your G-S, painted

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 2: Vado]
Ball all day, never sit on the benches
Bitches want attention and niggas wanna be mentioned
Two-four-five is what a nigga benching
Ain‚Äôt a scope, hit his henchman
Grab a rope, get the lynchin'
I‚Äôm handin' rappers suspensions
School of hard knocks, I come from a hard block
We‚Äôre pumping them hard rocks
I‚Äôm in the drop, one button away from a hard top
I‚Äôm playing the park lot, away when the narcs watch
Sitting on wild 'ye, foul play, is why I stay on my toes like ballet
No cars, but hand more keys than valet
Get robbed, they hand me the keys the way you down stay
If I play the bar, the Cris pours
Kick saw, deal in the cars with slick talk
Sick boy, I go hard, I spit raw
Far as broads, I threw more lobs than Chris Paul

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
Trust who? I don‚Äôt know who to trust
I got my hammer out, I don‚Äôt know who to bust
My V-V-S diamonds got them hating on me
Stick up kids outside the club, they waiting on me
I hit them up, now they waiting on the paramedics
Them niggas needed to get shot, like a diabetic
Puerto Rican girls, in my hotel room
I let my man fuck 'em, he going to jail soon
He got a threesome before he did his one-to-three
I almost walked in the court room with my gun on me
A nigga stay strapped, almost forgot I had it
A nigga still banging, almost forgot I'm rapping
Shut the club down, poured a hundred bottles
I was murder team, I‚Äôm uncle Luciano
You know, big talk, boss shit
When I do it, I do it big, horseshit

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
All I need is one square to function
And a connect that will meet me at the junction
Niggas talking reckless for nothing
But as long as it‚Äôs behind my back
I‚Äôm cool with niggas fronting
Cops on the street is like watching T-V
Lay back in the cut and watch 'em, easy
They say real G‚Äôs move in silence
So in order to get it, I just had to be me
Any plug comes with P-C
Me first, me second, me three
They say you ain‚Äôt a money nigga
Till your whip is a year ahead and your chick is out in D-C
But my Philly thing is imperial
That thing out in Virginia's wife material
My California love is so serial
My Indianapolis thing is so motor vehicle

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!{***Jay-Z , (Sauce)***}

Me)
If ya feel me (Fuck 'em all day fuck 'em all night we don't love these
Hoes)

Verse 3
(Can I touch that?) what's that? Leave it for dead
Keep ya arm over ya face my nigga (keep ya head)
(keep a mind to survive if ya sleep ya dead)
Stay fly 'til ya die nigga deep with prayer
(with each word ya say I guess the beef is dead)
Ladies & gentlemen (like impeach the Prez)
(Val Kilmer style nigga draw heat with feds)
(broad day like De Niro shoot all day)
I'm the man fuckin' the tracks and you just foreplay
Get a hit I, I come through, blow up, you spit out
What keep it cocked faithfully like salop
With one in the drop don't get hit up
(I be the 4-5th flamer hoes bitch shamer)
(clap cats a snitch she'll give ya whole click name up)
Look I done came up (and) thought a whole game up
Meet me in the square with one in the chamber
(The Face Off nigga)

Chorus
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew put ya guns up in the air if ya feel
Me
(If ya feel me) Fuck 'em all day fuck 'em all night we don't love these

(Fuck 'em all day fuck 'em all night we don't love these hoes) Yeah!!

This goes out (to my Brooklyn crew)...Intro: 2000, and it goes like.  (Uh Huh, yeah yeah)

Chorus:  This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Lay my game flat, what you wanna do
Talk all night, are we gonna screw?
I'm talking 'bout me and you

Verse One: Sauce Money

I like to push up on chicks like it's the last record
Take 'em to the telly get buck passed naked
Let 'em feel the power, lick 'em if it don't taste sour
Hit 'em in the shower for an hour
Give 'em that feeling, Sauce Money for real and
Let her get on top if there's mirrors on the ceiling
Hit her so right that she wanna throw rice
My device makes her say "Damn, that nigga's nice!"
Know I got wifey lay my cards when I pivot
Pass your seven digits if you're with it
Sauce wanna give you the option for the boot knockin'
Nine times outta ten it's on and poppin'
Ain't no stopping victory's in the air
Bring a friend next time let's do it again
Bring your whole crew if you see through me
And we can meet on the BQE
And it goes like

Chorus (2X)

Verse Two: Sauce Money, Jay-Z

Sauce Money:

Had this bitch bragging
Sauce had his tongue between my thighs lally-gaggin;
Huh, could you imagine
Shaking your tail just like a dragon here comes my worse flame
In the morning Hot 97 the first thing
(Deny it) Hell yeah y'all don't buy it
I don't eat no kind of fish if you can't fry it
But who knows maybe one day I'll try it
But for now slow down too much lip is killin' your diet

Jay-Z:

Can I get it what - Get it wet
When he hit it first can I get it next, shit you the best
It ain't wack to be with both of us, mami actually
I'm Eddie Kane Jr., that nigga me!
You want me to feel what he feel when it's tight
And I know, he don't be doing it right
But it gets no liver than this, never lie on our dicks
Shit, we got nigga's rides on our wrists
Play your cards right you'll be driving the 6
Shopping all day hoppin' out in the Dist
Popping the Crist., shit hoppin' outta your wrist
Popping your shit, New York's hottest bitch
]From the ghetto to the Stilletto's
But you gotta do it two times like an echo, y'all feelin' that
This is how we run it down the line
Nigga Sauce goes first Jigga next to rhyme

Chorus (2X)

Verse Three: Jay-Z, Sauce Money

Jay-Z

I see you got a lot to get off your chest
Coat, blouse, bra-don't talk me to death
Like murder's on your mind mami, off the dress
Jigga ran game 'til I lost my breath

Sauce Money

Last thing I need to know is what it costs for sex
What you need to know is if I lost respect
Don't have to worry if you do Sauce correct
I'ma bless that, bring my whole crew through, don't even sweat that

Jay-Z:  Uh, dime pieces I'm hittin'
Sauce Money:  Four in the morning Frosted Flakes in your kitchen
Jay-Z:  Now you want me to start trickin' I suppose
Sauce Money:  That's when the first Face Off kicks in-
"We don't love these hoes!"

Chorus (2X)[Intro]
It don't get no betta than this (uh-uh)
Uh, uh, uh, uh
B-K muthafucka

[Verse 1]
It's a shame but, alot been change since we came up
I used ta run wit them, now I got my guns for them
Treat my hollows like trash, strait dumpin' 'em
Sauce Money show niggas no love when I come for them
They thought they left a real nigga on his ass black
And that my numbers wouldn't rise like Nasdaq
And gotta re-half that, just pass that
We 'gon clash black for playin' the middle like ya ass crack
You can ball ova here, I play pass that
Exotic cats love ta talk peace when you blast back
No more fair ones, know you shot enuff of them
Don't really wanna do it, now you gotta fuck wit 'em
I'ma shit everytime that I hear ???
And make ya real ugly like bitter beer face
Sendin' fake thugs back ta the essence
Since my Rolex was a gift, there's no betta time than the present

[Hook]
This one is for my hustlaz

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this ta cats want they cheddar ta rise
Fifty grand too much, O.K. Seventy-Five
Sauce Money kinda cat you could never despise
Hit the streets lookin' like you a betta disquise
Get a grip, I'm the preacher, you dance wit the devil
Whoever my eyes focus on is not on my level
Not even close, ex-girlfriends hatin' ta see it
You can give me brain or get out, take it or leave it
Relax wit side who, max wit my crew
Operation gettin' money, that's what I do
Insecure artists pay me not ta spit
Show me fake love and then try ta fly if they hit
They could feel it in they bones, cuz when I drop my shit
All hell'll break loose, that's how hot I get
I rock big in the summer, witout missin' the block
When I wanna get M, then I listen ta Pac
Scarface when I'm laid back, whippin' the 3
If I wanna hear that shit, then I listen ta me
Stick in the key, turn the knob and open the door
Prevokin' a war, cats saw us smokin' the 4, fo' sure

[Hook]
This one is for my hustlaz

[Verse 3]
Look, I like ta come through and run up in 'em all night
Bring my man too, Mami if it's alright
I'ma a big one, but I like ta ball out
Sip Henny, smoke dro 'til you fall out
Hit 'em wit that Marcy maneuver, makin' 'em droppin'
I ain't met one yet make me take her shoppin'
But I might cuz I gotta lotta cash ma
Platinum Navigator Glock when the stash ha
Rolex, Cuban Link, now the riddle comin'
Do I know about 69, a little sumthin'
I like ya point-blank style, you in it ta win it
But before I go downtown, gimme a minute
You got ta shower up, make sure no dirt in it
I got the Pro-Fo, neva eva squirtin' it
That's a thong, (damn), baby you just hurtin' shit
Bring that thing here baby, show me what you workin' wit

You know the drill
Cut a check or suck a dick[Big Jaz]

[Jay-Z]
Hell Yeah. Let's start from the top
(singing intro)
Need to just kill that shit
You go first though, huh

[Big Jaz]
Go back!
Don't know Karate, but I kick back like a 45-70
Givin' yall niggas hell, enablin' me to live heavenly
Hit y'all faggots with my worst, still never get the best of me
Don't call me money 'less you investin' me
I'm the answer but you find time to question me
Fine wines and dimes blessin' me
Primetime professional over the bread like sesame
Crime stressin' water testin'
Got me arrested again, tested again
Tryin' to swim with the whales
Say you 'bout to blow with no wind in yo sails
Can't convince me, flinch or hench me
My shit is cut and dry, motherfucker drench me
I dare yo chilly ass to the 9th degree
There ain't been a true and livin' in your life since me
Pinch me, you movin' backwards when I'm slo-mo
My style'll bag a boy like a homo
Into linen like Yoko Ono
You can fry, so relax no lie
Power from bed eye, sendin' niggas beddy-bye why?
My team in the Big East take down your whole wack conference
Whole repetoir's pompous, know yo ass square walkin' 'round with a compass

[Tone Hooker]
Yo, Now what we 'bout to do is put down Foundation
(When it's time to step it up)
We rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic

[Jay-Z]
Hey y'all, I used to wreck off, bust the Tec off
Pop the cork off Moet off y'all, 3 quarters of the way
Now that's history, pop Christy 'till I'm pissy
Jigga, who is he? How bad y'all wanna know?
Stick my head out the V-twizzy ,Get Busy
Bust lead out, let the world feel the misery
Goin' loco, elude po-po
Prelude to a champion, competion
Not for nothin', can't be none
Limited edition, like the Lex with Coach leather
'cept my approach is better, now or never
However, y'all want it the style's forever
'till it's redundant, Jigga!
Me and my operation, runnin New York night scene
With one eye closed like
Peter Geisha
None of our foes have an idea, back in the days
To fool the Feds used to run our clothes for years
How can you possibly stop me?
I'm approximately a million overhead, U.S. Dollars
Product take cream like Juan Valdez
We's Kodak, Papa. See true co-lors

[Tone Hooker]
Yo, Now what we 'bout to do is put down Foundation
(When it's time to step it up)
We rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic
Yeah, we puttin' down Foundation
(now it's time to step it up)
So rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic

[Sauce Money]
Polish your wings for this fly shit
The Bed-Stuy do or die shit, this 325i shit!
You get nothing, child we buck and wild
Roc-A-Fella Clik nigga, you know my fuckin' style
When I deliver, niggas just don't give a
Fuck about nuthin', go all out like Hitler
Not enough doses to close this, it's hopeless
Fuck who the host is, nigga we the dopest
Motherfuckers rappin', Sauce Money had to happen
Record setter, record seller, Roc-A-Fella
Comin' thru like Idi Amin obscene
You do ya best while I fuck the prom queen
Flick cum on ya, drop the bomb on ya
Seperate ya clik, man lost an arm on ya
Love the position that we hold know
Crazy Juice, chicks quick to get open like Nicole Brown
Or heart surgery, to smart to murder me
3rd burn degree if ya start distubin' me
Word to mother, life's a bitch fuck her
Jaz and Jay stuck her, Sauce next in line with the rubber
Went from outcome to income, pretend some men come
They win none, I'm all that and then some
Duck to blink and not enough, you sinkin'
Pussy minds I penetrate what the fuck you thinkin?

[Tone Hooker]
Now what you heard was niggas puttin' down Foundation
(when it's time to step it up)
We rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic

Yeah, that's hot right there! Ha Ha Ha[Intro: DJ KaySlay]
Yeah it's DJ KaySlay the Drama King
I'm in the house with my nigga Sauce Money
Memphis Bleek, holdin it down from the East coast
And from the West, I got my nigga Game
All you bitch-ass niggas, y'all better fall the fuck back
Y'all know how this shit is about to go down
Yo homie, what's your name?

[Sauce Money]
My name is Money, that much is true
Listen up, this what I'm gon' do
I won't wait for you to get a lil' bigger
I hit you with the tec-9, lil' nigga
Look at him - red as a muh'fucker
Hah! Dead as a muh'fucker
Unassisted - aiyyo you shoulda
Been there Bleek, too late, you missed it
Cock back my biscuit
Like a fat chick and chocolate, I can't resist it
Didn't believe you, so for your big ol' ego
I got a big ol' Eagle
Gotta give the people
Not a fuckin chance to see you inside the sequel
Son I stay stuck in rude
So when they see me comin they like, "Damn, here come this fuckin dude!"

You know'm sayin Memph'?
Brooklyn what's up?
Got to take this shit back
Let's hit 'em with the hook son

[Hook: Memphis Bleek]
Sawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin that Arme', puffin on a blunt
All I know is my shit better bump
La la la la la-la la lahhhh

[Memphis Bleek]
What, yo yo
You know Bleek always smokin that "La La La" - you right
Groupies they be actin too crazy, tell 'em they too hype
They want leave with a G like Eas'
Educated the bullshit, got a degree in these streets
But - I dare a nigga act all crazy
The tec'll tear his back all crazy
And you know I stay bent off the Arme'
Regardless if solo or I'm deep with my amry
I rep - straight from the jacked M-P
If I put the tec up I gotta tote the D.E
But wait! You know I'm ridin with Sauce
And we ridin this song from out the Robb Report
Dawg, I'm from the street, from the best I'm taught
I'll get your man tied and lost, fuck the cost
Got a couple of my killers who stand by
And I'm G-Force stat' nigga, never fly stand-by

Uhh, jeah, you know
Put this shit right back in the street, huh?
Brooklyn shit, Sauce
Let's bring the hook back, here we go yo

[Hook]

[The Game]
Dip through N-Y, black Impala, matchin interior
Cali plates, I'm that serious
Niggas think the kid a joke
'til that .38-revolver spin like hundred spokes
Homie I bring the drama (drama)
Sleep on The Game and get left in wooden pajamas
Nigga I ain't easy son
But I break up rock/Roc like DipSet and M-Easy son
I'm a B-L-double-O-D
Hardest nigga since S-N-double-O-P
And all this beef got blood in my eye
Aftermath motherfucker, you could love it or die
Keep Dre name out your mouth boy
Or get your +Bones Crushed+ like them Dirty South boys
I'm a "Menace," fuck Kane and O-Dog
Since I was ten I had 'caine and O's, dawg
I ain't lyin (I ain't lyin)
They gave Eazy AIDS, so why should I give a FUCK about dyin?
And the day Jay retire
I'mma park next to the throne, in a Maybach on gold wires, yeah

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ KaySlay]
Yeah you bitch-ass motherfuckers
"Hands on the Pump"
Fuck around, find yo' ass slump
One hitta quitta, yes {*gunshots*}[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
Yeah, this right here, tell me why
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved, c'mon, check it out

[Verse 1]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream, that's right
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath, half your breath
I know you still livin' your life, after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life, after death

[Refrain]

[Interlude: Faith Evans]
Somebody tell me why
On that morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

[Outro: 112]
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
[Puff] Every day that passes
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] Is a day that I get closer
[Puff] To seeing you again
Every night I pray, every step I take
[Puff] We miss you B.I.G., and we won't stop
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] Cause we can't stop... that's right
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] We miss you B.I.G[Jay-Z]
...back again & back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again

As a youth I used to hold the weed up
Old heads said I thought more like a soldier than a leader
In order to succeed I had to slow my speed up
Didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the chieva
They said believe us or not trust is somethin' you earn
With every mistake you make back to us you return
Probably would go Hollywood I thought he was jokin'
My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smokin'
All engulfed into honeys the pussy was tight
If she threw the pussy right I got mushy like
Damn baby I love you take all my cash
"You ain't got to lie Jay," you already gettin' the ass
She loved that I was a thug it turned her on
Soon as I got soft it turned her off
I got relaxed put my feet up start dissin' my friends
& that's when the ceiling fell in

I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again

I came through with the shines
Like the streets was blind
Didn't master my Algebra no caliber
Stick me? I was thinkin' how & for what
But reality bites like a thousand mutts
Nothin' worse than the person that's foul with guts
To stick you quicker...
[Bleek]
This brand new nigga
Yup this is the foulest this ain't Hollywood
It's the Wild West whoever guns is the loudest
That's who's the best now take ten steps & draw
Who dope can take ten steps & remain raw
Who has no regards for the law?
Me that's who now let me ask you
Did you not know if we all don't eat
Some day that we all would beef?
Did you know about the crabs in the barrow
They would hear me creep
It's a muthafuckin' war in these streets

I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
& I'm back again I'm back again
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
& I'm back again I'm back again

[Jay-Z]
...from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again
...from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again

[Sauce]
As a youth I used to fold up
Old heads said I thought more like a leader than a soldier
Back in the days never no heat thought shit was cool
Good cat personified even went to school
Learned wild shit made me feel kinda live
Off of nothin' with this bullshit 9 to 5
I stayed broke made me easier to provoke
Ready to yoke the first muthafucka that joked
Same dude with the hard bottom
Went from laid back to locced out
From talk it over to t...I shot him
Ready to perish all the shit you cherish
Leave you the wettest I got a "You die first," fetish
I can recall helpin' old chicks across the street
Now I help myself liftin' cats off they feet
Can't give a fuck nigga I just lost my moms
Why I need to feel something steel in both my arms

I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again

[Bleek]
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
& I'm back again I'm back again
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
& I'm back again I'm back again

[Jay-Z]
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again back again
...from Marcy to Hollywood
& back again back again

Uh huh uh geah since y'all niggas don't like to think
I'mma make it real easy for y'all. You got three different
Types of nigga. First cat, as a youth is real wild &
For whatever reason he hit the money or whatever
Cooled out. You got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always
Remained ghetto. You know that type. Then, you got
One cat very smart young man. E'rybody wanted him
To be a lawyer doctor whatever. Pressure drove him crazy
He wiled out. Ha geah...

...Marcy to Hollywood
& back again & back again
Back again Biotch[Sauce Money]
I lay my gun fine, ideas be as bright as the sunshine
Shook the rap game with just one line
When me and my niggas combine, all day, you know what?
Sometimes, I run with mad niggas who done time
Hit you with eight, from one nine, now you showin the vein
My shells is like information, go in your brain
Holdin my slug, before you squeeze em show em the love
Burn your fingertips so throw em a glove, understand me
Before my album drop, cop the Grammy, uncanny
Bought my first Role' from Manny
Dirty burners my crew never hand me, nigga we family
You not, get shot, get caught slippin like Dexter Manley
With at least ten lead, spray right, paint your skin red
Damn we, all the shit you can't be
We big time, you small time, real small like how an ant be
Marcy, bust a shot for Metcalf, Tilo and Danny
Peace to the Bureils, Cut Wop and Stanley
Boom Moet and bow, my whole set is wild
Past threats, frontin flash singles and that's bent
Fuck a bitch, you know the drill
Cut a check or suck a dick

[Jay-Z]
Jigga, what the fuck?
As a youth explosively, clappin off the roof
Shootin guard like Kobe, raised up slay smears and bo'e
Back then, Gil was my co-d, Spanish Jose
Showed me how to get the money niggas owed me
Fast forward, no kids, six cars and three Role's
Two cribs, trips to Cuba, sippin on Ooba
Got rap in a stupor, first to clap your group up
From the Range with the ski rack, or six with the roof up
Shit, I light the motherfuckin soundproof booth up
New shit, y'all say the same shit like you're looped up
Your rap's all lazy, Jigga the Black Scorcese
What your album lack is more Jay-Z
Code name: Jay-hovah, all praise me
Y'all don't paint pictures, y'all all trace me
You've yet to see the day when my squad be done
I represent that shit nigga, Marcy son, what?

[Sauce Money]
I grab my dick in front of your bitch, screaming "Fuck your spot"
Heat miser, anything I ever touch was hot
Sauce watching all ya wildcats flop, sound greasy
One song on your whole CD, making my job easy
Figured as much though, got your hustle swinging
Cop a muzzle, then y'all got the nerve to drop a double?
Everybody ain't big nigga, everybody can't flow like Jigg Nigga
Bitch niggas listen: No sorrow tomorrow if you swallow hollow-points
Like a dread in the weed spot, I'mma move some joints
I ain't playing, these BK slugs spraying
Mute niggas could tell you how nice I am, it goes without saying
Malicious, rap flow vicious, stack dough
Bitches suckin' dicks, they fat boy delicious
Pretentious niggas get it in slow-mo
Kodak couldn't picture that, so X-ray machines taking your team photo
Niggas switching like a homo, shit on your team
Fuck how they feel, get all that CREAM
Here comes the drama, here's the drummer, they call your number
And now your fun-filled summer filled with bounty hunters
If a bitch fuck you for free, cats will kill you for the same fee
Think niggas give a fuck what your name be? Or your raw crew?
Kid you're all saw-through
Mad cause you ain't blow yet, never fret nigga your bitch blew for you
Get on some prince shit like, "I truly adore you"
Never, crab cat, fuck you, have that
Sauce mother F-U tricks all in the mix
300 large on my flat up in the sticks
Nothing but a lot of leg room, my son and my bitch
Getting fatter of salmon, croquets and grits
Peace to all my niggas in Marcy, Viya Schmidt and Bits [?]
L-channel henny and crime, nigga which?
One of y'all in the mirror looking facing them 8's
One in your helmet, might induce a case of the shakes
B-scott, what the deal son? Reno where the dro at?
Sauce Money
You know that, nigga[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it, like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big moved
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the Larkin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct
Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops
You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX
If this rap shit don't work niggas still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggas can't deny it
Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline
Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'mma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga
Ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X
Ruffryder you heard? We got the game mastered

I told you the pain was comin
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggas on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference? Either way I'm sonnin' your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggas comin to lose
Somethin to prove? Spit it, we can have a sprayoff
I lay off wack niggas and kill em on my day off
Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a mil stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin
For you Phil Jackson niggas on that Bull shit

[Verse 5: Styles P]
I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas
Shootin backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket
Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you
I tell niggas quick, suck dick and get a Glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I Ruff Ryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella screamin
Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella

[Verse 6: Jay-Z]
I know pop you can't stand us cause we cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brained in the four dot six Range
Shit main, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain
Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses
We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-classes
Iceberg sweats with I.B. on the elastic
Shit, beyotch! What the fuck, ya heard me?
Put some more beat on that joint[Verse 1]
Hibachi pots, Lemonade scotch in the Glock
Toast whoever ?? a nigga's watch
Riched up feeding her French duck
Up in Prime One, one son on me, he shoot like he fuck
A Welly Fargo yo Gallardo jet red
Listening to Marvin and Keith in them ??
Gambling spots, I own the lease
Quarter millions only, on top of the grass we got suites
Man, bottles of Rose, the OJs is here with cold play
I sit back, perform in the grown way
My paper is proper, my bitch hella copped
I bought, copped me to Alans ?? courts
So many reasons to eat
Don't wanna kill no more, ayo, I'm two steps away from the ??
Lee and Dirty ain't cleaned it in years
I'm hustling a new way, my bookkeeper is standing right here
Ice water is the logo, y'all niggas know so
Flavor like a adobo bring the mayor to ??
It's promo rap nigga, I grow though
Catch me south France lumberjack mink bunch of snow cones

[Hook]
I've been watching, I've been learning
It seems like I've been hustling for years
Now that I've got my earnings
I wanna get away from here
Cause as the world keeps turning
I'mma get mine I swear

[Verse 2]
Pull them off the lot, let's race 'em
I'm here to break the set to the break who can take 'em
The ambiance, giving no response he gets what he wants
The scratch that he flaunts, nightmares he haunts
I'm just a smooth killa, nothing to prove nigga
Your shit is hard but I'm like, ten times iller
I'm Merlot Sipper you can see my habit
I'm just a businessman besides your chick magnet
A grown woman lover, a shorty's father figure
You keep it all hood, I'm thinking much bigger
Cause life is sweet you spread your wings
The land, the kings, we get right and handle things, you hear?
Like pieces on the board
And my quest for peace is what made me a warlord, dig it?
Spit bars exquisite
No lies, I live it
No telling which island I plan to inhibit
Laid up with a bad bitch, choking on a cigar real far
Feeling stout pussy by the seashore
Smoking jacket and more broads
I'm here to get all yours
The prettiest one you pick, down on all fours

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hide the body, I got that hammers that hate you
Extended clips that's ungrateful
Only thing I could promise is your exit won't be graceful
I'm just hoping your necklace is tasteful
Put you to sleep, that's how I wake you
No alarm clock could ever wake you
I stay out late at night grinding for my payout
I shot my way in, I shoot my way out
That's if I have to, see how it play out
You have a better understanding for the day out
Politic ?? fine tools out there to lay out
AK out
Taking over blocks, making over spots
As the uncut raw and baking soda locks
Last stop inside this coke boy tour
Searching for paradise over this dope boy war

[Hook]Yeah

Intro/Chorus: Jay-Z

I'm what the game made me
Not what the fame made me
No amount of money can change me
I'm what you lames can't be
Live nigga what? Live as fuck
(repeat 2X)

Verse One: Jay-Z

Check, live from the 7-1-8
Either respect the flow or learn your lesson from your weight
I'm wishin arthritis on all writers who, Knock My Hustle
How can y'all understand the struggle?
It's hard to live, when you got greedy niggas in the mix
Knowin I outclass three-E niggas in the six
So I outblast til it's empty clips
And I outlast niggas, survival of the fit
One life, I gotta make sure it's done right
Cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation
Ball out, until I fall out
Stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out
Hard to think about your future with, nothin to gain
Hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain
Life's harsh, I know y'all runnin from 'caine
But it'll only catch you and track you down
With no deal, who you gonna rap to now?
Start your own record company, that's profound
Live niggas gonna rumble when you backs on the wall
Jive niggas gonna crumble and fall

Chorus

Verse Two: Memphis Bleek

Aiyyo whether in the Pinto, or rollin in the six
I come through cocky, holdin my dick
I never switch shit, cause that's some bitch shit
I get the Bisquick take it to the district
Cause I could never get rich, and switch my style
I just cop a little hurt, to the mercantile
I'm tryin to get it though, rhymin with this six digit flow
Gettin fly is the minimal, holdin somethin is the principal
Respect this young nigga that's, holdin the torch
Preachin shit like the crack game, don't take shorts
Throw it down it's a bet, nigga roll hard
Til you got somethin icey, round your neck
In this concrete jungle get rich or remain humble
Never speak the biz, at worst I might mumble
Niggas test it I spit guns, angrily
Til all that remains is me

Chorus (by Memphis Bleek instead of Jay-Z)

Verse Three: Sauce Money

I went from no dough to show dough to money to blow
From umm, ho I don't know, to get deez
Never, "Excuse me miss," bitch please, never try to provoke
Same disrespectful cat I was when I was broke
Ain't nuttin changed baby but the different faces I stop
Or maybe some of the places I shop
Now that I run through tracks like cleets with a Air
For some of the hottest beats, still catch me eatin at Pete's
Fuck the foul cat who screamed out and threatened my life
It's all good, here I come kid, dead to the hood
Til I'm in the dirt, foul cats like termites
Come out of the woodworks, if they think you stack paper
Dead niggas react later while the cancer spread
Teach a team how to scheme before they answer lead
You know me, I used to shoot hoops in the park, ain't nothin changed
Except now I push Coupe's in the dark

Chorus (Sauce Money instead of Jay-Z)[Sauce Money]
MC rhymin..
.. uhh uhh
Uhh, uh uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
MC, MC, M-A-R-C-Y
Uhh, uh..

MC rhymin, chart climbin
With the baguettes, Roley shinin
We smokin the best trees, I bet some skins on it
I got a SE, twenty inch rims on it
I got playaz who wanna kill me but love to speak nigga
Cause I got a freak every day of the week
They just fake friends, they hope the shit ends (fuck you)
They see the dough my click spend in the big Benz
They think it's sweet, now we rock cubans with diamonds in em
But if they sleep (what?) hell is where I'mma send em
I know it's beef cause I don't wanna be rhymin wit em
They wanna act like BITCHES, time to split em
What the deal Ma? Heard I was boss ha?
On the real, wanna hear it from the Sauce ha?
You like the way I do it? I just gotta spit
I got flow doughs hoes and a lot of hits

Chorus: Sauce Money (repeat 4X)

MC rhymin, chart climbin
Together we talk the talk, forever we walk the walk

[Sauce Money]
In the trial my niggas'll squeeze for the general
MP's holdin my heat, nigga run wild
I dial, executioners, go the extra mile
Nigga cock that, lose a screw when it pop black
Never provoke toast, niggas get ghost most
You couldn't be my family, we never spoke close
You spit that "yo" shit, I say "nosotros"
Don't fuck with them dudes, think them niggas homos
I'm talkin the bad bitches, you on some funny shit
You go for broke? I go for gettin money kid
I grab your homebase, now she give new honey head
To all you Donnie Brasco's, I'm Sonny Red
I split a weak nigga cheek quick, with one of those
Fuck a physique wrapped tighter than mummy clothes
Off looks alone probably get to touch em all light
But because of the flow, now I fuck em all night

Chorus

[Sauce Money]
You like dough baby? Work hard and you can get that
But in the meantime, let me hit that
Get you down on all fours, like a Kit-Kat
I'm tryin to split that, shouldn'ta did that
In and out with the quickness now what could make the brother stop?
Nothin, well maybe if the rubber pop
And even then that might not slow me down
I'm bout to go to town, wanna come? Show me now
Singular most MC's bringin your toast
I run roughshod rip rap stars and roast
I don't brag or boast, I only speak in facts
And if I say you seven days, how weak/week is that?
Fatal to niggas that's unable to ride wit me
You better decide who side or collide wit me
The very last rapper tragically he died swiftly
You been warned motherfuckers, now come and get me

Chorus

[Sauce Money]
MC..
Together we talk the talk, forever we walk the walk (4X)[JAY Z: Intro]
I told y'all niggas if it wasn't a skirt it was gonna be a dress
Don't give a fuck who you are

[JAY Z: Verse 1]
I makes the whole city hot like fiddy shots at idi-ots
Show him I got more then take the shit he got, Biatch!
Big poison and fuck up the city rots
The whole world supposing he's tryna dispose of me
You must know I give a fuck though, got a mean rebuttal
Try me! See where your luck go, you know what though?
I'm what you don't get a second chance at
Think you can chance that?
I'm laying niggas down ba'y bro
Think you can stand that?
Your train of thought derails like amtrak
My grand stack, hands free and a six; vivid jam-packed
Me, my crimees, and a couple of dime pieces
A bunch of rolexes, unlimited credit line visas
Heat is for niggas that want to touch but can't reach us
To each his own y'all can eat this chrome
Leave him speechless when the lead reaches his dome
Life ain't nothing but beaches and homes
