Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right

[Verse 1: Ray J]
Baby, you could be the first
I'm a be the first to ease your temper
We ain't plan four years
Girl, we could've had kids when you was chuckin' my timber
Girl, tell me what you want
Her friends don't get along, so we classify members
Ooh, nipples hard, girl
I ain't got to start, but we cover like winter
We done get it too much, we never did wrong
All night long, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Ray J]
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Brown sugar, babe
I gets high off your love and don't know how to behave
I pour wine in the tub and we could drown in the grapes
Ooh, I'm all over your anus, yeah I'm crowdin' your space
I'm a junkie for your love, girl, your body like base
I got some cocaine on the mirror, you could powder your face
I told her, 'Take her panties off', she say, 'What are those?'
'Bout to play up in that sugar like the Sugar Bowl
Ooh, and you must be used to me spendin'
And all of that sweet wining and dinin'
But I'm fuckin' you tonight, open up, I scuba dive
You're the wifey, you're the bride
I fucked the hoes that threw the rice
I was Tunechi, you was nice, you was sugar, I was spice
Me and you sweet and sour, perfect match, Bonnie, Clyde
Sexy drop of caramel, honey, all of this sugar ain't good for me

[Hook: Ray J]

[Verse 3: Ray J]
Ain't no wave, baby, we can drown
We done give too much, we never get away, baby
You come 'round and I ain't gon' put it in you
You get brown sugar, talk about everything you want
I'm a give it to you, baby, what you want do?
I'm a live for you, baby, it's true
Little Hennessy, a little coke, a little weed
Girl, I ain't gon' judge you
All I ever, ever want to do is fuck you and love you, I know it

[Hook: Ray J][Hook: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

[Verse 1: Ray J]
I had her head going north and her ass going south
But now baby chose to go West
We deep in the building she know that I kill 'em
I know that I hit it the best
Candles lit with that wine, money still on my mind
And I gave her that really bomb sex
No matter where she goes or who she knows
She still belongs in my bed
Going hard in the streets, mobbin with my homies
Sippin' on good, blowin' on OG
Me and ghost sittin' clean with the matching rollie
I did that first so everybody know me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Steady on at the top where we finna be
Apple juice and we mix it with the Hennessy
Give her no dough to come, but I gave her 10 to leave
I bet I hit it first, unless you took that girl virginity
First come, first served is all a player know
But I don't wanna be a player no more
That's a lie, I'm way too fly
I love anything with ass that walk by
Yeah you love her, yeah you hug her and you kiss her
She dome me up, she give me face like some whiskers
Tia’s and Tamera’s, I be knockin sisters
And I still hit, while you lonely and you miss her

[Bridge: Ray J]
When I walk in the function
You already know I'm leaving with something
Girls know when I'm coming
I give a girl real proper loving

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ray J]
And if you were to come back to me
Girl I know just how you'd do me
And if you were to come back to me
Girl I know just why you'd choose me
And if you were to come back to me
Girl, I'll get it wet -- jacuzzi
And if you were to come back to me girl
We'll make another movie

[Hook]

[Outro x4: Ray J]
I put her on, I put her on, I put that girl on[Intro]
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

[Verse 2]
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'll sick
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

[Bridge]
I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

[Hook]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time{SEX-Y, CAN, I?}

Havin a party (Bring the weed)

I got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Smokin' smokin' weed

[Snoop Dogg]
Jumped out my bed and I head downstairs
Wiped the boogers out my eyes
Put some braids in my hair
Grabbed my favorite toothbrush
And then some crest
Rinse my mouth out
Now I'm ready for the rest
Break it down, roll it up
Pass if you've had enough
You're with the big boss Dogg
So go and puff puff
Real talk
Can you still walk?
Have a seat
Have a drink
Now rest your feet
See that's the problem
You think that you can go with me
Smoking cest your whole life
Now you wanna blow with me
Go to the store with me
And get some swishy sweet
And grab a bite to eat
Before you fall out
I'm a ball out
And everday
We're going to smoke until we all out
And that's a promise cause
We got the bombest bud
And you can ask Ray J
He know's what time it was

[Hook]
In the cadillac
With my head back
Feeling real good
Because it's like that
Another 20' sack
We've got plenty' that
We keep doing that

Smoking smoking weed
Smokin on these trees
Keeps me at ease
With these
Crazy things I see
Smokin on these trees
Keeps me it seems
And I don't just where I'd be
Smokin Weed!

[Hook]
Smokin' Smokin' Weed
Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I've got my lighter (Got a blunt)

Wish you would pass it (guess I'll wait)
I'm right beside her
I got an ashtray (at my place)
Where did my pipe go?

[Shortymack:]
So what you got nigga? (knockout)
I got the cush and the yerp
Packaged in P's to keep the feds of my chirp
Uhh cause my nerves' on alert
Paranoid like your boy cookin up the work
Look pimpin I ain't touching that dirt
I ain't smokin that shit
It'll make your whole head hurt
I got the card for the cataract
Doctor say it's legal
To twist up green
Call it Philadel eagle (shortymack)
Knockout pays me my check
Silver haze blowin out the lambourghini air vents
I got the blunts and a pound of leaves
I been the purp man plus I got that OG

[Ray J:]

Roll it, roll it
Twist that, twist that

Fire it up
Then get that, get that

Get bent back bent back
Give it back to me!

[Hook]

[Slim Thug:]
(Slim Thugga Muh Fugga)
Blaze in the bush of that cush
You gotta pull hard then push
I blow dro but to each his own
And I keep shit fit like Cheech and Chong
We can be outta town
We can be at home
I keep a good connect for that Cali grown
Weed so strong you can smell it through the sac
It's in the backpack in the trunk of the 'lac
It's a buck that's a fact
Won't accept nothin less
So you can smoke alone
On your sack of stress (yes)
Pass the cush
Lemme hit that next
Slim thugga muh fugga

Ayyy, know we been together for a minute
But uh, its kinda been forever since we been in
The kinda situation not involvin other women
And it's pretty obvious that your kinda trippin
Like "Who the hell is this bitch?
Lookin a hot mess, what you fell for this chick?
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it"
I'm like "You need to go somewhere else with this shit"
Because, I ain't gon' put up wit'chu
Talkin 'bout how she make you uncomfortable
Like I mean, shit I'm only 17
And um a perfect couple is only in a dream
And right now I'm pretty much away for this
Relationships? I think you should wait for it
I mean later we could try things out
But not right now

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Ha ha, yeah, look

When I'm not faithful, you be feelin all pain

Baby girl 100, I ain't tryin to do that
Got so many girls and I ain't lettin go
Cause my life is great, and you ain't nothin but a ho

See it in your eyes when you’re looking at me
Goddamn, Imma burn a hole through the middle of your Givenchy
You ain’t ready for this beast I be
[?] with a little Cognac, a little something in my swisher sweet

[Bridge – Ray J]
I don’t understand why I feel this way
Got me feeling like I'm in outer space
Swear I always been the type in the club that'll hold shit down
Caught up in the matrix, so far gone, don’t wake me now

[Hook - Dria]
Don’t keep me waiting, I’m anticipating
Come meet me baby, in this dream
You and me
I be the [?], come home when you need me
Got my arms wide open, I mean my legs wide open with me
Got my legs open like an ATM
Got my legs open like an ATM
Hundreds in a bank roll, got me open 24
XO got me kinda throwed, kinda throwed, kinda throwed

[Verse 2 - Quavo]
Beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
Like Michael Jackson, bout to beat it up
Got her legs open like an ATM, so I told her cash out on this spatula
You the baddest bitch in the club, right?
So I hit her with a left like fight night
In the club tight, diamonds shine on bright
Looking like I work at [?]
I’m the king, baby call me Elvis
Can a nigga see below your pelvis?
I didn’t come alone, I came with the felons
She want to take it to the next level, I’m a trend setter
Baby living better, she want to see if I got real cheddar
My pockets so fat, look like nutty professor
The blue Benji’s make her feel better

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ray J]
Damn she wetter than a tsunami
Sweating like a motherfucker, hotter than a goddamn [?]
She’s a rider like a Ducati
If you want to come and get it, spit it
I'll eat it like an edamame

[Bridge]

[Verse 4 – Takeoff]
Takeoff a young rich nigga
Christian Louboutin sweater
Gold toed, these are Maison Margielas
Pockets sloppy, [?] change the weather
Slippery whip out, I'm Cinderella
I can make it rain in any weather
I look like Frank Lucas in the chinchillas
Pull up in the Bentley, you niggas weak
I'm a veteran, you just a beginner

[Verse 5 – Offset]
Offset!
She wet like Pacific, her head is terrific
Lil mama, she gifted
She suck on the dick, baby girl do not kiss it
Eat it up, eat it up, like I am jiffy
Intelligent independent, she been fucking with me from the very beginning
Church girl, when she with me she sinning
I’m granting her wish, she calling me a genie
Got my finger on her panty line
Lil mama bad, you should see her mom
She looking sexy when she chew on gum
Come with Offset, baby have some fun
3 2 1, lil mama she the bomb!
In her Birkin bag, she keep my gun
Bitch is sucking and she number one
She Brazilian, not American (Foreign!)

[Hook][Ray J]
You ain't gotta turn the bass up
We gon' make the neighbors wake up
And when we done, we gon' do it again
So ain't no reason to be putting on your makeup
Go ahead and let your hair down
Ooh, I wanna pull your hair out
I take a bow after I put it down
Take a shout and let that air out

You gonna love it by the time I'm through
Cause once I get it, girl
Watch what I do with it

The sex is bananas - bananas..
Between me and you

Shorty be the bomb, she's my red-bottomed blonde
Red-bottomed bag, I'm just a well-paid don

We made love all night, but we could top that..
Sex is bananas, I took her shopping in the sky

I pour wine in the tub and we could drown in the grapes
Ooh, I'm all over your anus, yeah I'm crowdin' your space
I'm a junkie for your love, girl, your body like base
I got some cocaine on the mirror, you could powder your face
I told her, 'Take her panties off', she say, 'What are those?'
'Bout to play up in that sugar like the Sugar Bowl
Ooh, and you must be used to me spendin'
And all of that sweet wining and dinin'
But I'm fuckin' you tonight, open up, I scuba dive
You're the wifey, you're the bride
I fucked the hoes that threw the rice
I was Tunechi, you was nice, you was sugar, I was spice
Me and you sweet and sour, perfect match, Bonnie, Clyde
Sexy drop of caramel, honey, all of this sugar ain't good for me

[Hook: Ray J]

[Verse 3: Ray J]
Ain't no wave, baby, we can drown
We done give too much, we never get away, baby
You come 'round and I ain't gon' put it in you
You get brown sugar, talk about everything you want
I'm a give it to you, baby, what you want do?
I'm a live for you, baby, it's true
Little Hennessy, a little coke, a little weed
Girl, I ain't gon' judge you
All I ever, ever want to do is fuck you and love you, I know it

[Hook: Ray J][Hook: Ray J]
Hey love - I see you rolling in your 500 Benz
Hey love - and girl, I got a homie for each one of your friends
Hey love - hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love
Hey love - hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love
Hey love

[Verse 1: Ray J]
Baby, tell me what it's gon' be
You got your girls with you and I got my homies
So you're trying to spend your money, girl, won't let me treat
For the night, for the night, yeah
Baby, I ain't one of those lames
And spending money ain't a part of my game
Switching lanes - wondering how you gon' say my name
It's only right, it's only right, yeah
Your hair long, you got bankrolls so you ain't got no worries
So would you come and turn it up with me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I've been watching you from a far
For as long as I remember, you remember those Boulevards?
Dice game, hustle hard - it was more like volleyball
Long hair, Hollywood, but still kept it hood though
Crenshaw riding cars, knew you'd be a superstar
Days in the maze, we so high, upper echelon
Eye contact, caress, is you with?
I ain't had a crush in years, saying:

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
It started at the ruck, I saw you with your man
Smiling, huh, Birkin bag in your hand
Trying to work it out very day thinking 'bout you
Pull up in the Mulsanne, you pull up in the coupe
Hoping shawty 'bout it, you want it then I got it
She don't buy no shoes if the price tag ain't got no comets
Tried to keep my cool, all white Jimmy Choo's
Dress drop to the floor, let me get you in the mood
G5 through the stone, baby, don't be getting scared
20 racks on your bag, 5 racks on your hair
Until then I'mma lay up in the cut
Montana, Ray J, you know what's up

[Hook][Intro: Krayzie Bone] + (Ya Boy) + (Ray - J)
Krayzie Bone, Amiratti, it's The Life...Let's Go

[Ray J]
Ray-J, Knockout!

[Ya Boy]
Rocka!


[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
They claim that they get high but see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let's see, I doubt if they can go higher than me

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
I've never been this high before, levitate rise off the floor
Elevate, get high some more, drift with the wind to the sky I soar
Like a bird, like a bird
I feel like I'm floatin' through fantasy island in the brain, up in the plane lost
My vision, is simply not in good condition, did I mention
We go hard, and we don't even leave home at all
So what a nigga doin', we ball, ball, so carry on
The Mary and the Molly clearly got me very cloudy
So I sit back with my mind in the zone, mindin' my own
Need nobody, I can get high on my own
You're on the late flight,my flight is already gone
I'm in the sky you ain't even left home
I black out my mind and I feel free to be, whoever the hell I may wanna be...

[Chorus: Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see (so I can see)
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see...

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona' fry
And it ain't no lie
Ghost sittin' low and my bitch real high
And it ain't no lie...

[Ya Boy]
Look up in the sky it's a bird, it's a plane
Half a pound of herb to the brain
On a highway in the sky, I swear to God I might swerve in the lane
I'm high and that won't change, smoke that bomb Saddam Hussein
Bitch meet me on that cloud, go ahead and climb that crane
Who the flyest of em' all?
Who the highest of em' all?
They call me Rich Rocka, I grab a pile of hundreds in case I fall
Might find me in a Lamborghini, with a light skin bitch in a tan bikini
Got my mind in a whole another world trying to jump up on tryna' trampoline me
I'm smokin' the ganja green leaf, so high can't no one see me
Nigga I can fuck any bitch, we gon' skinny dip and smoke some seaweed
I'm high like Krayzie Bone
You understand?, okay we gone
Get high, don't say we don't
Pay the dopeman, I don't pay these hoes
She still wanna' try me though
Wanna know what kinda' high we on
That's a hybrid I'm highly on
I'm bout to hit it like a xylophone
I'm like E.T.- (phone home)
Eyes tight - (Hong Kong)
She lickin' on me - (snow cone)
I'm outta' here (so long)...

[Chorus: Ray J]

[Bridge: Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...(x2)

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you get real big
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck's fifty percent
I ain't into goin' half, I'm payin' the whole rent
Whole crib hot boxed like there ain't no vent...

[Outro: Krayzie Bone]
They claim that they get high but see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let's see, I doubt if they can go higher than me

Get high, get high, get high,get high, get high (x2)[Hook: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

[Verse 1: Ray J]
I had her head going north and her ass going south
But now baby chose to go West
We deep in the building she know that I kill 'em
I know that I hit it the best
Candles lit with that wine, money still on my mind
And I gave her that really bomb sex
No matter where she goes or who she knows
She still belongs in my bed
Going hard in the streets, mobbin with my homies
Sippin' on good, blowin' on OG
Me and ghost sittin' clean with the matching rollie
I did that first so everybody know me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Steady on at the top where we finna be
Apple juice and we mix it with the Hennessy
Give her no dough to come, but I gave her 10 to leave
I bet I hit it first, unless you took that girl virginity
First come, first served is all a player know
But I don't wanna be a player no more
That's a lie, I'm way too fly
I love anything with ass that walk by
Yeah you love her, yeah you hug her and you kiss her
She dome me up, she give me face like some whiskers
Tia’s and Tamera’s, I be knockin sisters
And I still hit, while you lonely and you miss her

[Bridge: Ray J]
When I walk in the function
You already know I'm leaving with something
Girls know when I'm coming
I give a girl real proper loving

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ray J]
And if you were to come back to me
Girl I know just how you'd do me
And if you were to come back to me
Girl I know just why you'd choose me
And if you were to come back to me
Girl, I'll get it wet -- jacuzzi
And if you were to come back to me girl
We'll make another movie

[Hook]

[Outro x4: Ray J]
I put her on, I put her on, I put that girl on(Intro)
Hey What up Felli. Knock out. Yo Like I say, Ray J, L.A stand up. Yeah west coast

RAY J -Chorus:
We goin' party till the early morn
When the Lakers bring the trophy home
We got that California purple gold
And F them Laker Haters cuz we down with the greatest

ICE CUBE:
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off 'em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep 'em chuckin' and coughin'
Off that California purple, that Laker Purple in the air
C’mon everybody, Paul Pierce need his wheelchair
3rd year, still there, this will be my third
My style's like Magic Johnson, yours is like, Larry Bird
Overrated nerd, but this ain’t the 80′s man
We got Ron Artest, don’t you know, he’s a crazy man
Defense all crazy man! This ain’t no lazy man!
All up in your jersey like the ghost of James Worthy
You ain’t worthy to hold up that championship trophy
Rollin' down Figueroa on the bus with Kobe
Don’t ask my ring size, you already know it
I got a drawer full I might as well throw it
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin' be sweet to watch the Lakers repeat
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat

Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep em' chunkin' and coughin'
Off that California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Chino XL and Roscoe Umali]
Chino XL:
The Lakers are magnificent
Critics better admit it
We winning, shoot it, pivot
With less than a second left and it swishes
Don’t test us, you know how vicious
Artest is, leavin' the Celtics cryin'
Like Lebron when the Magic gave em that ass whippin'
Lake Show you know we down for the kill
Score numbers greater than gallons lost in that BP oil spill
Paul’s pie gets pierced by the king of the kings
Rondo’s obsessed like Schmegal with the Lord of the Rings
His name was Kobe

Roscoe Umali:
Roscoe Umali, I reppin' for the Lakers
The all time greatest, can't nobody fade us
I do it for the jersey that be hangin' from the Staples
Jabbar, West, Magic, Worthy, Chamberlain and Baylor
Fisher, Pau and Bynum got championship rings with diamonds
While the homies Ron Artest to run the defensive assignments
Bench mobbin' Odom, the Black Mamba Kobe
We parade on Figueroa with the championship trophy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 New Boyz and Ray J]
New Boyz:
We the best it's so. How you ain’t a fan by now bro?
Laker’s over there head like it Shannon Brown dunk
Anybody stepping up, we getting rid of them lanes
Say LeBron needs Verizon, he ain’t getting a ring
Play LA and it’s over for sure
Tell them Boston leprechauns that them clovers don’t work
The Lakers win another championship
That’s why we got D Fisher to keep on reelin' 'em in

Ray J
It’s gonna be down Lakers in the motherf---in house right now
Ya’ll need to stop, stop runnin' your mouth
We gone celebrate and pop bottles right now
You ain't gon' top us down

New Boyz:
Ok I’m ballin, yeah I’m ballin
Them fouls you can’t be callin’
Watch you in it girl
League my n---- we be on that Spartan
Number one and you can call in
We put that ass to bed
Buzzer shot game winnin'
Derek Fisher, Ron Artest, Kobe Bryant on they head
We call that dude the man
Catch us up in LA reppin with my Laker fans
Purple and gold, yeah we smashed 'em up and they gone
Lakers took the whole series and the rest went home

ICE CUBE:
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin be sweet to watch the Lakers
Repeat I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off 'em in the finals so often
Always on fire. Keep 'em chunkin' and coughin'

Off that California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple X4

[Lil Rob]
Check check it
Lil' Rob from San Diego but I’m down for Los Angeles
I'm down with Los Angeles, L.A. K-E-R-S
The best from the west side (Left side)
We at the Pacific to be specific
All I need the purple and gold holmes
If you don’t know, now you know holmes
Don’t act stupid, stupid
You know how we do it, when we hoop it

[Hook/Outro]I know we on this shit again
But we done come too far to stop or give up
And I know you think it's better to just leave
And this is where we disagree

But I know I'm shooting with my words
Except they're the only words
You know my actions are louder then what you heard
I'm tired of this arguing and I wish for one last thing
It means the world to me

Cause I know what we got
Even when you don't
We rock, baby, 'til the wheels fall off, feel me
It's real love and I still believe if I wish on one last thing

Last call, last kiss
Baby, just one last wish
Last wrong, last slip
Baby, just one last wish

Been through it all
Fought through the pain
And our love's even stronger, girl, we can do it again
And so that's all and that's it, baby, just one last wish
Last wish

Girl, I'm sick and tired of dj vu
Cause here we are again at the top of our lungs
'Til we both know we love harder then we
Give each other chance to see

And every time I see tears, it hurts
Tell me, is it really worth
You crying, me lying, it's absurd
A better man is what I'ma be
So I wish for one last thing
And that's you and me

Cause I know what we got
Even when you don't
We rock, baby, 'til the wheels fall off, feel me
It's real love and I still believe if I wish on one last thing

Last call, last kiss
Baby, just one last wish
Last wrong, last slip
Baby, just one last wish

Said, we done been through it all
Fought through the pain
And our love's even stronger, girl, we can do it again
And so that's all and that's it, baby, just one last wish
Last wish

Oh, damn, if I could just wish for one last thing
Oh, baby, we've been here before
Got outta control, then we let it fall
It's time that we pick it up and never have to sacrifice

This is my last wish
This a new setup, we can do it better
Me and you against the world take over together
Yeah, that's how real love should be

So, baby, one last call, one last kiss
Baby, just one last wish
Last wrong, last slip, baby
Just one last wish

We been through it all
Fought through the pain
And our love's even stronger, girl, we can do it again
And so that's all and that's it, yeah
Baby, just one last wish, yeahYeah, Melody
I just wish that I could hold you
While you're slipping through my fingers, as I'm playing the piano
What is that sound it sounds so beautiful
And I just wanna be close to you
Close enough that I can feel you
I'm already wondering where you are
And it sounds like it's coming from my guitar

[Hook]
Melody, said that I love you
Melody, said that I adore you
Melody, said that I need you
You can call me foolish and I might be but I'm in love with a melody

Donnie and Stevie they can write you
Now you come humming in my write too
As the music's playing in my radio
I hear that sound it sounds so beautiful
It makes me wanna just embrace you
Your close enough that I can taste you
I know just where you are caus your right here next to me

[Hook]

[Guitar solo]

[Hook till the end][Intro]
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

[Verse 2]
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'll sick
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

[Bridge]
I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

[Hook]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time[Hook: Ray J]
Do you remember when I met you girl everything was alright
Do you remember when we got a room we was fucking all night
Do you remember the time, girl?
Like I remember the time, girl

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Girl you my type, you just right
That blouse on you fit just right
Them jeans she got on skin-tight
She sexy, cool, but still shy
I'm colder than a Klondike
My polar I got dumb ice
We know each other, we go together
Like hamburgers and french fries
Everything is alright
We'll never have a fist fight
But last night had a sex fight
Then told her have a blessed night
I'm leanin', I'm meanin'
I fall asleep might have dreams in it
Hit the club and bring my team in it
Not tonight, I'mma bring my queen in it
I go get it, you bullshitters
I hit it, damn right that kid did it
You hood critics and hood chickens
Please try to stay out my business
From south France to south Philly
ATL to North Memphis
From my city, to your city
Think you got more swag but not really

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'mma put it down
So Gucci gon' wake up so
I run it it's gon' hurt
But when I'm gone it'll make you want mo'
Scented oils and candles
I pull up in my Lambo
The bestest that you never had
Two backstreets off the main road
You had her but she left so
That's just the way the game go
No one on my level so get up out my lane ho
I met a girl so real that it's no need to run no game on
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song
I'm on her like a long john
Short skirt with no thongs on
Sexy naked sunbathin' outside my house with frames on
I took her for some buster and that boy ain't gon' do shit about it
It's alright if we kick it, tell that sucker forget about it

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ray J]
Girls to my right, ladies to my left
The weather's real hot, snow on my chest
And I see this fly girl, tried to get her number
Then she tells me that I already smashed last summer (remember?)
Mile high club, G5 planes
Remember back rubs and pink champagne
Mile high club, G5 planes
Remember back rubs and pink champagne

Smokin' smokin' Weed
Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Smokin' smokin' weed

[Snoop Dogg]
Jumped out my bed and I head downstairs
Wiped the boogers out my eyes
Put some braids in my hair
Grabbed my favorite toothbrush
And then some crest
Rinse my mouth out
Now I'm ready for the rest
Break it down, roll it up
Pass if you've had enough
You're with the big boss Dogg
So go and puff puff
Real talk
Can you still walk?
Have a seat
Have a drink
Now rest your feet
See that's the problem
You think that you can go with me
Smoking cest your whole life
Now you wanna blow with me
Go to the store with me
And get some swishy sweet
And grab a bite to eat
Before you fall out
I'm a ball out
And everday
We're going to smoke until we all out
And that's a promise cause
We got the bombest bud
And you can ask Ray J
He know's what time it was

[Hook]
In the cadillac
With my head back
Feeling real good
Because it's like that
Another 20' sack
We've got plenty' that
We keep doing that

Smoking smoking weed
Smokin on these trees
Keeps me at ease
With these
Crazy things I see
Smokin on these trees
Keeps me it seems
And I don't just where I'd be
Smokin Weed!

[Hook]
Smokin' Smokin' Weed
Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I've got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Wish you would pass it (guess I'll wait)
I'm right beside her
I got an ashtray (at my place)
Where did my pipe go?

[Shortymack:]
So what you got nigga? (knockout)
I got the cush and the yerp
Packaged in P's to keep the feds of my chirp
Uhh cause my nerves' on alert
Paranoid like your boy cookin up the work
Look pimpin I ain't touching that dirt
I ain't smokin that shit
It'll make your whole head hurt
I got the card for the cataract
Doctor say it's legal
To twist up green
Call it Philadel eagle (shortymack)
Knockout pays me my check
Silver haze blowin out the lambourghini air vents
I got the blunts and a pound of leaves
I been the purp man plus I got that OG

[Ray J:]
(I wanna)
Roll it, roll it
Twist that, twist that
(I wanna)
Fire it up
Then get that, get that
(I wanna)
Pass it around
Get bent back bent back
Give it back to me!

[Hook]

[Slim Thug:]
(Slim Thugga Muh Fugga)
Blaze in the bush of that cush
You gotta pull hard then push
I blow dro but to each his own
And I keep shit fit like Cheech and Chong
We can be outta town
We can be at home
I keep a good connect for that Cali grown
Weed so strong you can smell it through the sac
It's in the backpack in the trunk of the 'lac
It's a buck that's a fact
Won't accept nothin less
So you can smoke alone
On your sack of stress (yes)
Pass the cush
Lemme hit that next
Slim thugga muh fugga
I smoke the best

[Hook]

Ha ha it's your boy Ray J
You know what? I'm a roll up one right now

Supermodel chick man I bag at your sneakers

Act right yeah damn right I'd eat her
No wedding ring, just some tattoos
Of my name on her chest and her ankles
She loves me, you could never tell her I ain't that dude
Yeah I been to jail, and she knows what I've been through
I got her wide open that's what a thug do

This is thug love, and she my world y'all

[Verse Two: Papoose]
Them lame dudes ain't lovin you right
You feelin lonely, you need a thug in your life
(Yes!) You need a man with knowledge and self
Champion Lover, I'm rockin the belt
Wanna go clubbin, I won't beef
I'm a freak in the bedroom, but I'm not a control freak
(Uh!) She can't take yo' place
Her Louis bag wack and her UGG boots fake {*girl giggles*}
Spaghetti with no onions
She got pretty feet, toes with no bunions
She'll put her feet in that food, I'll love it
She know the way to a man's heart is his stomach
...You got what I want
I ain't stressin if it's that time of the month
It might sound nasty, but if the cops ain't in sight
I'll look both ways, then I'll run the red light

[Chorus: Ray J] (*Red Cafe)
Baby girl want some of that (Thug love) So I'm a give her that (Thug love)

[Verse Three: Red Cafe]
Hey Pretty Young Thing (*Wassup?) Meet the King
I'm from the borrough of kings doin my thug thing
And I rock bling, and I gets moolah (What else??)
My dick's bigger than your 12-inch ruler (WHAT ELSE??)
Big chain like Slick Rick Ruler
In the club, it's swingin like that jeweler
Shorty brain good (yep), she gon' be my tutor (yep)
So I'm obligated, I GOTTA DO 'ER!
In the back seat, in the front seat
She ain't gotta pay me, it's all courtesy

And I'ma knock it down with my Timbs on

[Chorus: Ray J]
Baby girl want some of that (Thug love) So I'm a give her that (Thug love)

{Ray J} Nah {New Boyz}
But she ain't gon' tie me down
{No she ain't gon' tie me down}

[Hook: Ray J]
She ain't gon' tie me down, while you on the road
Buying all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What'chu want right now? Whattup right now?
I think you need to close your mouth
Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down
Tie me down... you ain't gon' tie me down
... you ain't gon' tie me down

[Verse One]
Ayyy, know we been together for a minute
But uh, its kinda been forever since we been in
The kinda situation not involvin other women
And it's pretty obvious that your kinda trippin
Like "Who the hell is this bitch?
Lookin a hot mess, what you fell for this chick?
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it"
I'm like "You need to go somewhere else with this shit"
Because, I ain't gon' put up wit'chu
Talkin 'bout how she make you uncomfortable
Like I mean, shit I'm only 17
And um a perfect couple is only in a dream
And right now I'm pretty much away for this
Relationships? I think you should wait for it
I mean later we could try things out
But not right now

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Ha ha, yeah, look
Ay girl whattup? No I'm not gon' make a scene
But you can't tie me down like a pair of shoestrings
Yeah you cute, so what? Girl let's get it through your head
Yeah we make love, sex, weed all in the bed
It's the "Best That I Ever.." but things gon' change
When I'm not faithful, you be feelin all pain
Now you stuck like a stain and I can't believe that
Baby girl 100, I ain't tryin to do that
Got so many girls and I ain't lettin go
Cause my life is great, and you ain't nothin but a ho
Yeah you come to my shows and you very supportive
Just show me a camera and my show recorded
It was nice, but I'm suprised that you still standin here
As you know, I'm a man, and I have no fear
I'mma start it from the top, girl this ain't no lovin
I'm a New Boy girl so
