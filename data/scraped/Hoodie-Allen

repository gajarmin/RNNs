[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, no oh-oh-oh-oh
Said I'm all about it

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming "Who want what?"
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the lime light
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, "Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front"
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
The young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus

[Bridge]
One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold and now everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]

[Outro: Ed Sheeran] (x2)
And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no[Hook] x2
Got on my leather jacket, thriller
There sure ain't nothin' iller
Man I'm a lady killer, if I want her I'mma steal her
I promise I could make her fly away like caterpillars
So if you don't know by now then you should probably get familiar

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I been through like a hundred cities
Signed a thousand titties, I'm talkin' millions of bitties
I'm a dog, I chase that kitty, if your girlfriend is pretty
Chances are I'm tryin' to snatch so I could slay and take her with me
Bro I'm the man, did you not know that?
Your girl want me to take a picture with her on her Kodak
And you're so whack, she knows that
I be where the coke and smoke at
See her friend and now I'm going for that three like I'm Steve Novak
Don't be mad at me if she leaves
You should always know not to fuck around with thieves
She just wants to kick it with some g's
Smoke some trees, pop some p's, later she'll be on her knees
And I'm gone
So if you really want her for your own
Be worried if I show up on her phone
You don't want to leave the two of us alone
Cause I'mma probably taker her somewhere soon to bone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Hoodie, oh jeez, goddamn, look at all my followers
Bitches ride the wagon, but I'd rather give her cholera
Many look at me like I ain't even got a fuckin' plan (fuckin plan)
Alright, that's cause I'm the fuckin' man
Yo girl on some Romeo and Juliet
Cause she would rather kill herself than ever be with you again
So I swoop in and tell her, if her parents don't approve of me
That don't change a goddamn thing, girl, I don't buy no jewelry
Never spendin' money on a necklace
Or a bracelet, let's just face it, like you better when I'm wasted
And you like me when I'm silent, silent but I'm deadly
Me and G some lady killers, let me start the medley like, hello (Hi there)
And please don't put your number in my phone (Don't do that)
Cause I might text you after all of this Patron (My bad)
It tends to help me out when I'm feelin' alone
But I don't wanna go, I don't, I don't wanna go

[Hook][Vers 1: Max]
I gave you all my loving
Offers I had a dozen
But I ain't give 'em nothin' never do you like that
But then I caught you creeping
Secrets that you were keeping
Like every other weekend
Why you do me like that

[Pre-Chorus: Max]
So now you say you take it all back
Yeah, that don't mean jack
Cause I know the facts
I swear you must be smoking that crack
I'm dipping so fast
Yeah, I don't need that

[Chorus: Max]
Now you're running your mouth
But there's nothing that can slow me down
You're messing around
Got me thinking that it's time to you go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cause I'm not listening, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I see you move your lips, but it sounds like gibberish
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi (gibberish)
Ou shilibo shilibo naow middi middi (gibberish)

[Verse 2: Max]
I don't need to recover
Rising way up above ya
Go run and tell your mother
Why you do me like that
Good luck with all the others
Don't care about the number
You all deserve each other
Why you do me like that

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
These girls like to talk, wait a minute I'm talking back (shh)
Say that she wanted to love me forever, but I was just trying to smash
First date and I'm taking her back
Bought herself a ring, I didn't take her to Jared's
Russell Wilson and she'll be making a pass
We just met, but I think she arranging a marriage
Like, stop, just hold up
Not the type to get hopes up
I go hard like I'm supposed to
But you back down like a post up
Oh wait, is that my poster
Album signed by yours truly
I swear you said that you don't know me
But girl it looks like you kinda knew me
Oh shit, obsessed, but I'm already undressed
Already got like 99 problems, and I ain't trying to confess
I did my best to move away
But she follow me with that bouquet
So I shaved my head, bought a toupee
But she too smart like Lupe

[Chorus][Intro]
All American
First team bitch

[Verse 1]
I got a fake ID and a checklist
It goes never meet a girl on Craigslist
And never spend your money on a necklace
3 square meals, homie gotta have breakfast
Real shit, she be payin' for the date
I be on my Will Smith, Enemy of State
Keep my friends close, keep my enemies away
Like they own repellent, uh, they so jealous
I'mma do shit that just piss them off
Say you never heard me, it's your loss
They bitin' all my freestyles
They told me make my money frontin' on that weed style
I tell 'em I be too old for it
And I gave my brother my ID
She independent, bet these bitches never find me
I hope they don't find him though
Cause they be knockin' on my door
Now they lookin' through my window

[Hook]
Tell me what you really want from me
Point blank, no discussion
Closed mouth, Closed mouth, ow
I'll give it to you, no interruption
And tell me one time that you want me
I promise that I won't say nothin'
Sh-shut it up sh-sh-shut it up
I'll give it to you, no interruption
In your home, in your home
On the phone, on the phone
All alone, all alone
I'll give it to you no interruption
In your house, in your house
On the couch, on the couch
Name the time and the place and the function
I'll give it to you, no interruption

[Verse 2]
Talkin' money, I don't really give an F man
I got power like a motherfuckin' X-Man
Married to the game, but I'd rather be the best man
You be on the same shit, all day, s-pin
Brand new kicks, why you shoppin' at a Payless
Do it on my first take, skippin' all the Bayless
See me, you could be me but I end up on the A-List
I'm chillin' with Rihanna in the K-K-Caymans
I'm just kiddin', I'm a white kid, hi kids
Anderson Silva, I hit him with the high kicks
Never been realer, you nothin' but a side kick
Oh you on MySpace? That used to be my shit
So who's killin' the game, who's the culprit
I be workin' like I'm Anders Holmvik
Now I got a bunch of new friends, and they all rich
Got blazers, Aldridge

[Hook]

[Hook]
I know it's hard to give you everything you want from me
When I'm running on empty
I know it's hard to be the type of dude you want to be
Cause your girlfriend wanted me

Where she want it though?

[Hook][Intro: Jhameel and Hoodie]
We should take a walk someday, dream about what we could've been
But I don't wanna leave this place, no faith in Brooklyn
(Yeah)
If I move out one day, it will make me a better man
(What up Jhameel)
But I don't wanna leave this place
(It's Hoodie, It's Hoodie)
No faith in Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Hoodie]
I said I'm so gone, oh my god, where the menu?
Order me all your sushi for them bitches at the venue
Stop, drop, roll, continue
Cause they just try to mingle, and I'm just trying to sing you a song
Tell ya that I'm leavin' but I won't be long
If it was up to me I would see ya tomorrow
But talk's cheap so I'm paying up
New kicks be the only way I'm laying up
So maybe I won't make it as an athlete
But that don't mean I'll let the competition pass me
I money ball, Billy Beane and some skinny jeans
And the whole damn team just some mini me's
Cause they ain't seen another kid like this
It's on your mind baby you should probably write this
I told her I can dance good for a white kid
So turn around, show me everything I might miss

[Hook: Jhameel]
We should take a walk someday
Dream about what we could've been
But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn
If I move out one day
It will make me a better man
But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn

[Verse 2: Hoodie]
I said repetition-repe-repetition like a muscle man
You just wanna tie me up, snap me like a rubber band
It's 2012 so now they wanna ask me what's the plan
I tell 'em never trust a man unless he Russell Brand
Pass me on that Absinthe now watch me change my accent
I got girls in the back on a mattress
You got girls on the map, like, that's it
They wanna know, am I Jay Sean or Raekwon?
Good Sean, or great Shawn?
Stay long, or Kreayshawn?
Now, either way, they try to stifle your dreams
I tell 'em keep your eyes open, you won't like what you see
They be here for a minute, now they gone in a week
You tryna Dante the peak, I'm tryna Andre the beat
Lord, can you tell me where my faith is
I graduated and I still ain't made the A-List
Ain't a problem if you tell me how you feel girl
I know the road rules, but you need the real world

[Hook: Jhameel]

I said ooh, girl, turn around
Tell me where we're goin' now
Ooh, girl, take it back
I don't want to end like that

I'm all over the world
I'm all over the world
And come back to Brooklyn
(We should take a walk someday)
And come back to Brooklyn
(We should take a walk someday)
And comeback to Brooklyn

[Hook: Jhameel][Hook: OCD: Moosh & Twist]
I ride for my clique
I get live with my clique
Go get high with my clique
Do or die for my clique
Said it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
And you can never tell me nothing
I ride for my clique
I get live with my clique
Go get high with my clique
Do or die for my clique
Said it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
And you can never tell me nothing

[Verse 1: Twist]
You already know just where I be dog, I ain't being cocky
But Philly what I'm repping, watch me check it like it's hockey
I ain't tryna get it twisted, if you get it then you got me
If you with it, cool, if not, I'll treat you like a Tamagotchi
I'mma let you down point, yeah, I never disappoint
Give me something I can I spit on, watch me rip it like a joint
I'm 'bout to take her out to dinner, guarantee I tip her
Little but we do it big, like I was a dipper
And these homies never crushin', guarantee they never bustin'
Dog, your flow be super weak, now go to sleep like Robitussin
I ain't tryna be that homie who could never make it happen
If you down let's get it crackin', make that paper keep it stackin'
Like I love the way it feel, when she break it down for real
What's the deal, flow is worth a mil
Trick, I'm 'bout to kill, keep it trill
That's the way I roll, that's the way I go
That's for 'sho, that's the way I flow
Every day you know...

[Hook: OCD: Moosh & Twist]

[Verse 2: Moosh]
I'm like one time for my day-ones, man, who the hell gon' stop us?
Came up from that dark side, where they ride around with them choppers
Stay clear of them gold diggers, trying to get a piece of that lobster
Man, I be whipping it so hard, gotta watch out for them coppers
But we just bringing Philly back, it's just me and Twizzy Mack
Swear to God I'm on a roll, you gon' have to willy that
Hear about the kids, we just scare 'em out of gigs
It's about damn time that they verify the kids
Man, I'm feeling stupid homie, I might do the money dance
I flew to Vegas and I woke up at the bunny ranch
Baby, you too official, I'm tryna see it with you
You know they call me Q, be my Moesha Mitchell
I'm like pay what you owe me, I don't play with you phonies
I got enough friends, I don't bet with you homie
You ain't talking 'bout profit, my hands stuck in my wallet
It's all good, my slate clean, don't worry 'bout it, I got it

[Hook: OCD: Moosh & Twist]

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
Running with teams up and out of your league
Looking like Leaf, Ryan, you trying but never achieve
Fuck it, I'm cutting down everything that you aspire to be
People be talking 'bout all of your raps and they falling asleep, capital Z
Put on my track and I'm burning 'em down, shout to love letters fired to me
Bank account is like millions, living life with some villains
Pulling up in that stolen car, scaring all the civilians
Rich bitches be pissed at us, bad bitches be missing us
I'm out here with that Moosh & Twist, these other rappers just kids to us
So zip it up, I ain't talking 'bout it, 'less I live that
Big bitches on thin ice, yeah homie my shit crack
Bend over then get slapped, 'bout to teach a lesson
Every time I touch the beat, they said "oh god" like it's a blessin'
Watch me take your girl, I'm just messin'
Watch me take your job, I'm just messin'
I got these old women screaming my name at the top of they lungs, like they might be pubescent
I got your attention, and I ain't gonna drop it
The more that you listen, the more that I profit
So I'mma keep ripping, and y'all can keep floppin'
I'm rap's Robert Griffin, so who gonna stop 'em?
SHWOOP[Verse 1]
She got an ass like her mama's, call that Julia Roberts
This pretty lady is crazy cause she addicted to drama
I'm tryna keep it romantic, I'm like Matthew McConaugh
Don't need to be a detective to figure out that she want it
She ride around in a Cadi, probably bought by her father
She loves to listen to oldies and wear her hair like Madonna
She tell her dad I'm a doctor, I think that she clueless
I only play one on TV like I'm a young George Clooney
Dawg I was destined for movies, getting better when older
You need to get (get) that (that) dirt off your shoulder
If you are slacking a bunch, pack (pack) it (it) up
Got a Wahlberg flow, pack-packing a punch
Billy Madison I'm never packing a lunch
But I'm eating y'all raps cause you snacking it much
I'm just a fighter, an All-American psycho rapper
I Minnie Driver these girls crazy, there ain't no after
I'm on that Casablanca, watch out homie this is classic
My life reality television, ain't no one acting

[Hook]
The city can be mine
But you just need to stop and learn your lines
Hey girl, well let's make a movie
You can be my leading lady beauty
Grab your camera, don't be shy
Things ain't always black and white
We can make this world into our movie

[Verse 2]
These people asking me questions, they like "how did you do it?"
Now the way we blowing up, it's like a Michael Bay movie
I got a beautiful mind, so got these beautiful women
They say you win some and lose some but all I'm doing is winning
My life like Benjamin Button, let's go back to the future
And start it back in 2000 with just a mic and computer
I was just writing these raps, trying to bring the whole city with me
I went from being Home Alone and now I'm Richie, Richie
I put my old life behind me, jumped in front of the camera
I got these honeys going crazy, call that Jessica Alba
These other rappers are like how come they can't get to where I did
Vring vring, here come Johnny homie I'm shining
I got bad bitches on my dick, clips homie I'm grinding
It's so dope, they go home to TiVo and rewind it
Struggling rappers are acting like they some waiters now
They busy watching me make it homie, you wait around

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Is it your eyes? Is it your hair?
Is it your look? Is it your stare?
I swear the camera love, love, love, love
I swear the camera love you
Is it your eyes? Is it your hair?
Is it your look? Is it your stare?
I'm tryna cut, cut
Oh this is the cut - the director's cut

[Modified Hook]
Hey girl, well let's make a movie
You can be my leading lady beauty
Grab your camera, don't be shy
Things ain't always black and white
We can make this world into our movie

[Outro]
Now let the horns play...[Intro]
I said my tour just sold out
Album's been bought out, girlfriend might put out - terrific
Oh that's the good route, shit that you dream 'bout
Now that you got it feels different
I don't need no one, no one to tell me
Everything will be alright
Hair just like Elvis, hands on her pelvis
But let me delve in

[Verse 1]
I said I got a lot of dreams and you got a lot of needs
So there ain't a lot of time for me to help it
And I ain't slept in nearly 20 weeks, is that healthy?
I'm making money when I go to sleep, is that wealthy?
I'd rather talk about my self esteem but that's selfish
Lot of folks complain about the cards that you dealt me
But I'm still here shuffling the deck, yo what's come of it?
Used to know it all, now I'd rather just discover it
So fuck it, man, I said fuck it, man
Yo, fuck it, man, I'm just a lucky man

[Hook]
Baby I want it all (x2)
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore

[Verse 2]
She like "oh you so worried about getting broads and shit"
Comin' to my shows just to hear applause and shit
They get mad at me when the fans throw they bras and shit
Tryna tell me that it ain't part of my job descrip
I'm re-writing the history either way you interpret it
My life is like a circus the way these clowns have been surfacing
But you had my back, you memorized every word
Maybe bridges are meant to be burned
And when he gave you passes, I was gassed I can't lie
But I was busy living out my passions, that's why
My friend's just laugh, it's funny
The type of shit I'm mad at
90% is love, but all we hear is the bad
I wish I could take back the time we wasted talking 'bout you
I wish I could take back the time we wasted being mad
The funny thing about it's that I'm better off without you
It'd be worse if nothing changed
So now I'm glad that I matter on my own
Yeah I matter on my own
Really out here on my own
And I just thought that you should know

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And I don't want to let this thing go
Cause they leaving me with nothing, nothing
Leaving me with nothing, nothing
On my own
I'd rather just watch it all grow
Cause at least I got something, something
100% of something, something
On my own

[Hook x2]Puff Puff Humbert:
Man I feel like we live in a life of Nintendo
Cause reality is such a hassle
Sometimes I even find my princess in another castle
I should ask Dr. Mario for medicine
Maybe hit up Little Nemo for a sedative
And slip into a Final Fantasy until the sequels get repetitive

You know I'll never let this stack up against me
Tetris
Some call me Pac Man, mak-a-mak-a-maka
Cause I eat these spirits for breakfast
And if my game ain't startin'
Baby feel free to blow on my cartridge
Alcohol makes everything so pixelated when you party in a

You know we livin' in a
8-8-8-8-8-8-bit world
We're side scrollin' in this
8-8-8-8-8-8-bit world
Collectin' coins in a
8-8-8-8-8-8-bit world
We're next level

Hoodie Allen:
Nowadays, my life's so complicated
My TV is 3D, not pixilated
The music is 4 free and 5, 6, 7, 8 bit
Plug me in, you don't even gotta say sh^t
Hittin' all my neighbors in Mercedes
Okay they annoyed
Ask me why I do it
Cuz I'm all about the Paper Boy
Let me know that I am just the illest villain they employed
Let me slow it down
Slow it down with the illest noise
Damn girl you kinda made my screen froze
Take you to my d-pad who you who's the hero
Give you all the recap, got a Metal Gear flow
Cause it's so sold my whole team brolic
Came to L.A man
Now I gotta dodge her
You ain't gonna make it in these streets like Frogger
Come on Youtube like a blogger
You heard me
Groupies wanna blow
Kirby

[Hook/Hook]

Puff Puff:
I drink until I feel like Tyson punched me out
And until these chicks get sick of us
I'll collect hearts like Kid Icarus
Hey Princes did I tell you
I'm gonna be the next Legend of Zelda
I'm gonna be the one making noise, a real Mega Man amongst Paper Boys

Hoodie:
I take these ploys, lay them out, tell them see you later
Haters getting in my face so
I'mma call them Space Invaders
Once I get her
I'mma take her
Ya'll say that this is luck son
But they ain't ever shoot me down (down)
Duck Hunt

[Hook/Hook][Verse 1]
They say the way I act is immature
Well don't be mad at me because you're feeling insecure
The only golf I ever tried to play was miniature
And when you ask me sign your boobs I smiley face my signature
But my parents raised me right, they were sticklers
And we don't even fight, we're like oil and some vinegar
Getting a job is like a pregnant woman giving birth
You're trying to push me in the wrong direction and it fucking hurts
So most our friends already moved out of they mama's cribs
I'm still throwing parties at my house, like Stifler
So if you go around and try to tell me how to live
I'mma take your girl and Mortal Kombat finish her

[Pre-Hook]
But when it's done and the party shuts down
And the cops try to lay my ass on the ground
One day we might tell our kids, but until that day let's live like this

[Hook]
My friends grew up, they never get drunk
They never wanna hang out late
They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills
They're gonna get old and gray
I'll never do that, I wanna stay young
Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun
So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age

[Verse 2]
And when it comes to getting older
No matter what I do, I'm never feeling like a grown up
People trying to make me change, you'd think there was a quota
Like there ain't enough unemployed motherfuckers with diplomas
Everybody waiting 'round hoping that they blow up
But I'mma make it sooner, Oklahoma
I learned to be a player, make money like I'm an owner
These other rappers are so over the hill, word to Jonah
So if you see me in a restaurant, say hi to me
And if I ask you if you like my new shit, lie to me
Word to Tim Roth
And I don't know if I fit in with your society
So chill, take a pill for anxiety and doze off

[Pre-Hook 2]
But when it's late and you're all alone
And you're too damn drunk to be walking home
Then maybe you should call it quits
But until that day let's live like this

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay
We can live however we want
And there ain't nobody that can get in our way
Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay
We gon' do whatever we want
Never gonna listen to a word you say

[Hook][Intro: Max]
Take those words that you say
Don't use them against me, against me
When I'm walking away from something gray
I know you'll try to temp me, to temp me
When our hearts can't relate no more
I want you to forget me, forget me
Sometimes it feels like a war
But know I ain't ya enemy, ya enemy
But

[Hook: Max]
Bullets fly, bullets, bullets fly in the sky tonight
Bombs may burst, bombs, bombs may burst
Bullets fly, bullets, bullets fly in the sky tonight
Bombs may burst, bombs, bombs may burst
In love

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Party at the Malibu, trying to adjust to the elevation
Brought no car to LA, so I walk cause I ain't tryna to pay for no validation, uh!
Double meaning, no, double entendre
Watching Assandra get undressed in the back of a Honda
Sometimes off on the road, it's crazy, I ponder
I see them, syke, but no relation to Wanda
I'm tryna to wonder off and dance and shit
Romance and shit, too many bops at it like them Hanson kids
But I'm so fancy cause even when you at your worst
Sometimes you'll Tokyo drift and then everything'll burst
This shit a gift and a curse the way that I analyze
I grew up wanting more, I'm never satisfied
My father told me always have my pride
Would've of worked at Burger King making fries
If it meant helping his fam survive
And now the nine-to-five, it's more like nine-to-nine
I only take a break just to talk when he on the other line
Tell him put on my mom, promise everything is fine
I've been working hard so you don't have to work all the time
That's real shit, fuck that mass appeal shit
Fuck that record deal shit, I would rather make it on my own
They say there's limitations when you're enter in that throne
But I don't think how they think, so competition is unknown
In a league of my own, no Rosie
Wolf on these beats, no Posey
Now everybody will know me
People keep on talking but there's no beef but Kobe
Fuck it, sometimes I wish that I could clone me
Cause I've been up wrestling with stuff like I'm Triple H
Only fuck with twins, I tryin' to get me a triple date
Triple A , gettin' lifted, never vacation but I'm trippin'
Off of like what everybody say
But I just gotta know what's in my heart
Because the world that type of place where people try to take your art and then they pull it all way
Some friends addicted to that Oxycontin
I've been addicted to music, so I fuckin' forgot them
I should of been there when the ambulance respondin'
But I was probably on a plane, sellin' tickets out in Boston
Another show at the House of Blues, this place is hella packed
And kids been waiting since 6 A.M. just to see me rap
But how the fuck you gonna compete with an animal
I got the hunger, I'm overthrowing the capitol
These muhfuckers talk about me at they shows
But then they love me when we standing toe-to-toes
How's that rational?
Fake shit, I don't need that real blood
Homie bleed that I don't even mean to go and make it violent
But when you say something, stand behind it
All I got's my word in this life, so I write it

[Outro: MAX]
Take those words that you say
Don't use them against me, against me
When I'm walking away from something gray
I know you'll try to temp me, temp me
When our hearts can't relate no more
I want you to forget me
Sometimes it feels like a war
But know I ain't an enemy, an enemy[Verse 1]
I got Michael Clark Duncan on my speed dial
You ain't impressed girl? He from Green Mile
Buying things I couldn't afford, let me keep mine
Rich kids never payed for clothes, that's "free" style
Said "I'll give you the world", so what you need kid
Siamese like where the fuck do I begin?
It's kind of funny, we all chasing the money tree
Son of a bitch, cause bitches want to have sons of me
Is it right girl? Is it sex trade?
White girls, push that white girl to get paid
And do you blame 'em when you meet someone who's famous
On the internet, for saying all the things that you've been saying
Man I do it for the principle, yeah you know that "holy crap"
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who holds me back
It's fictitious, I'm here with some big wishes
But I'm really ain't sick, please don't tell Kobe that

[Hook]
Here we come, on our way
We don't got no job today
We don't want one any way
Here we come, on our way
We don't got no job today
We don't want one any way

[Verse 2]
Everyone's a critic, but no one listens to their advice
Staring like I'm Angelina Jolie in a pair of tights
Foreign kids, and yoga pants, but she use to go-go dance
Sample my parents favorite record, Like I know that band
I make 'em real proud, I make 'em hold their hands
Speak a little Spanish, but how do you say Gold in France
Le or, put everything on the tour bus
On deck, circle, but I'm waiting 'til you're up
And I've been skipping out on life a bit
You've been trying to come between us like we hyphened it
Promise that I'ma listen to everything that you said, but
I'm busy making these hits, and you're busy making your bed
So, sleep on it, we on it
I got a couch, no Chappelle, put your feet on it
Gave me a little buzz in the oven, now I'm a honey bee
But no one's gonna like you when you're twenty three

[Hook]

[Bridge]
This is for my friends that I lose
If I don't grow up, I won't grow up now
This is for my friends that I lose
If I don't grow up, I won't grow up now
This is for my friends that I lose
If I don't grow up, I won't grow up now
This is for my friends that I lose
If I don't grow up, I won't grow up now

[Hook][Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, no oh-oh-oh-oh
Said I'm all about it

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming "Who want what?"
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the lime light
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, "Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front"
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
The young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus

[Bridge]
One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold and now everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]

[Outro: Ed Sheeran] (x2)
And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no[Hook: OCD: Moosh & Twist]
I ride for my clique
I get live with my clique
Go get high with my clique
Do or die for my clique
Said it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
And you can never tell me nothing
I ride for my clique
I get live with my clique
Go get high with my clique
Do or die for my clique
Said it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
Yeah, it's all that I know
And you can never tell me nothing

[Verse 1: Twist]
You already know just where I be dog, I ain't being cocky
But Philly what I'm repping, watch me check it like it's hockey
I ain't tryna get it twisted, if you get it then you got me
If you with it, cool, if not, I'll treat you like a Tamagotchi
I'mma let you down point, yeah, I never disappoint
Give me something I can I spit on, watch me rip it like a joint
I'm 'bout to take her out to dinner, guarantee I tip her
Little but we do it big, like I was a dipper
And these homies never crushin', guarantee they never bustin'
Dog, your flow be super weak, now go to sleep like Robitussin
I ain't tryna be that homie who could never make it happen
If you down let's get it crackin', make that paper keep it stackin'
Like I love the way it feel, when she break it down for real
What's the deal, flow is worth a mil
Trick, I'm 'bout to kill, keep it trill
That's the way I roll, that's the way I go
That's for 'sho, that's the way I flow
Every day you know...

[Hook: OCD: Moosh & Twist]

[Verse 2: Moosh]
I'm like one time for my day-ones, man, who the hell gon' stop us?
Came up from that dark side, where they ride around with them choppers
Stay clear of them gold diggers, trying to get a piece of that lobster
Man, I be whipping it so hard, gotta watch out for them coppers
But we just bringing Philly back, it's just me and Twizzy Mack
Swear to God I'm on a roll, you gon' have to willy that
Hear about the kids, we just scare 'em out of gigs
It's about damn time that they verify the kids
Man, I'm feeling stupid homie, I might do the money dance
I flew to Vegas and I woke up at the bunny ranch
Baby, you too official, I'm tryna see it with you
You know they call me Q, be my Moesha Mitchell
I'm like pay what you owe me, I don't play with you phonies
I got enough friends, I don't bet with you homie
You ain't talking 'bout profit, my hands stuck in my wallet
It's all good, my slate clean, don't worry 'bout it, I got it

[Hook: OCD: Moosh & Twist]

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
Running with teams up and out of your league
Looking like Leaf, Ryan, you trying but never achieve
Fuck it, I'm cutting down everything that you aspire to be
People be talking 'bout all of your raps and they falling asleep, capital Z
Put on my track and I'm burning 'em down, shout to love letters fired to me
Bank account is like millions, living life with some villains
Pulling up in that stolen car, scaring all the civilians
Rich bitches be pissed at us, bad bitches be missing us
I'm out here with that Moosh & Twist, these other rappers just kids to us
So zip it up, I ain't talking 'bout it, 'less I live that
Big bitches on thin ice, yeah homie my shit crack
Bend over then get slapped, 'bout to teach a lesson
Every time I touch the beat, they said "oh god" like it's a blessin'
Watch me take your girl, I'm just messin'
Watch me take your job, I'm just messin'
I got these old women screaming my name at the top of they lungs, like they might be pubescent
I got your attention, and I ain't gonna drop it
The more that you listen, the more that I profit
So I'mma keep ripping, and y'all can keep floppin'
I'm rap's Robert Griffin, so who gonna stop 'em?
SHWOOP[Intro]

[Verse 1: Kina Grannis]
Screen falling off the door - Door hanging from the hinges
My feet are still sore - My back is on the fringes
We tore up the wall - We slept on couches
[2x] We lifted this house

Oh, Anna Sun
Oh, Anna Sun

[Chorus]
What do you know? - This house is falling apart
What can I say? - This house is falling apart
We got no money - but we got our heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town - this house is falling apart

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I don't wanna waste my time with - Girls who rolling they eyelids
Girls who lookin for a place to stay - Cause they came away from Long Island
I don't wanna make your mind up - I'm just trynna make you mine quick
But ever since I put you in my line-up - All I do is choke: Heimlich
Good girl in a bad dress - Ain't nothing really changed but your address
In the Upper West Side - You were thinking of the people - that never would have accepted all your assets?
I'm [?], you cash par - I'm a give you anything that you ask for
You a small town girl but you living in the city
Oh girl, you'll be living in the city now

Oh, Anna Sun
Oh, Anna Sun

[Chorus]
What do you know? - This house is falling apart
What can I say? - This house is falling apart
We got no money - but we got our heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
What do you know? - This house is falling apart
What can I say? - This house is falling apart
We got no money - but we got our heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town - This house is falling apart
[2x] This house is falling apart[Intro]
Aiyyo! My name is Steve Witz
We got Obey on the beat
Go by the name of Hoodie
Uhn, It's Hoodie Allen
Yeah, yeah, It's Hoodie Allen
Aiyyo, let me get serious for a second right now

[Verse 1]
Aiyyo, I made myself some promises
Some New Years resolution shit
Try to patience in my life but I be losing it
There's no confusing it, I kinda got so nervous
Community service man, I still think that it's worth it
But I want to show my younger brother just how he should live
I hope Amanda's lying, I'm too young to have a kid
What a trick, so now I'm flying up, potato locka
Arrested for seduction, you say I'm Frank Sinatra

[Hook](2x)
And I wanna go back to the 50's
I wanna be down, acting shifty
And we could be the talk of the town
Everybody get on the ground
I wanna go

Aiyyo, I made myself some promises
Just had to acknowledge it
I became a college kid, too lazy to follow this
I'm being honest cause truth just ain't a commodity
Let's go and pretend to be who we wanna be, gotta be
Honestly, I got this drama in the worse way
Wrote this on my birthday, the minute I heard play
Those were the worse days, Big even said it
Cause when I get on tracks you know I'm big headed
But sooner or later, we will be super stars
Get girls with super bras and tell them to take it off
Inside of my suped up car, I couldn't assume this
This wasn't the reason we was making this music
Do this as a rebel because my cause on the scene
I wanna be a young James Dean, know what I mean
Ironically, we become icons, ladies pull your Nikons
Say "cheese" with the lights on, I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I wanna go back to that place where we used to be
Michael J. Fox, in to the future B
And where we're going, we don't need to feel it mutually
I just be Fonzarelli cool, so the cool you see
She just needing jewelry, then I'ma need a exit quick
Cause I don't spend shit unless you excellent
Get it? You got the best of it, now lets go

[Hook][Verse 1]
This is for my Instagram models
Eatin' up the cake, watch it go right to your bottom
You should get a new job, holla at McDonalds
Listen when I speak, baby you could write a novel
The way I spit flows put you in a pickle, cause I did it with no label
Got a crystal ball, but I don't need luck cause I 'ready got them pesos
It's simple, treat 'em like Kinkos cause they only tryin' to copy me
Last I checked you ain't some handsome devil with a college degree
But you think you can have your cake and eat it too
Well tell me why these pretty women never leave with you
I even ask your mom and pops and they like, "We approve"
That's why your girlfriend screamin' out my name, I call that Beetlejuice
Cause I'm the one she choosin' as her preference
Minnesota women show me love like I was Kevin
Pull up in your city, I could swear there's no exception
Get up in my Xbox, cause I'm well connected

[Hook]
I know some people that they used to hate
20 women in my trailer like I'm movin' weight
Yeah no wonder why we celebrate
Hold up, you ain't invited homie you can bake a
Cake cake cake cake cake cake cake
Homie you can bake a
Cake cake cake cake cake cake cake cake

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they wanna talk, but I don't wanna conversate
Watch these women serve the pussy like it's on a plate
Gordon Ramsay though, watch me grab a fancy ho
Just because we eatin' that don't mean that we be on a date
Plus I'm more Seth Cohen than you've ever been
That's why I take all these women down like medicine
You be poppin' pills just to get some extra thrills
I said, "Hell no" to my lawyer, you can throw out all my deals
Im like Ving Rhames when I bring game
Put a bunch of cash under the table
And cop me a big name and a big house
And a show on basic cable
Probably be hostin' some comedy roastin'
Just talkin' 'bout shit cause it's very explosive
They wanna control this and remote control this
I pull out the guns or they give me a holster, shwoop!
I'm tryin' to coast along the coast, caught me a Aston
Na, I ain't the son of Christ, but I got passion
You offended? Woops, I ain't even askin'
I'm too busy fuckin' these older women like I'm Ashton
Bang!

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm Hoodie, I'm-I'm-I'm Hoodie
I'm Hoodie, I'm-I'm-I'm Hoodie, bitch
I'm Hoodie, I'm-I'm-I'm Hoodie
I'm Hoodie, I'm-I'm-I'm Hoodie, bitch[Intro: Hoodie + Tayyib]
You know in the run in Anchorman where he's like "I’m serving up, hot bacon and egg

Thank you, thank you for rocking out tonight
You could be anywhere in the world. You right here
I got my special guest, Tayyib Ali man

Yup, We bringing this all the way from the Key-stone state

Chilling in the Empire state 'til we run the entire state

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Sitting in my '97 Honda, Yolanda
Be cool, she just want to go to Benihana
These fools rocking in my mother fucking spot
Got a little bit of nerve and a lot a bit of pot
I can smell it while she hanging out the passenger side
Of her best friends ride, now she trying just to holla at me
(No Scrubs)
Knows how to fight, cat fight, punched her in the left eye
Chicks be getting feisty cause they fighting for the best guy
Yeah I'm bumping Biggie but I've never been to Bed Stuy
Counting out my money in a shoebox to my bedside
That's old school, no city bank
Got another girl all she listens to is Chiddy Bang
Everyone around me keep complaining that the city change
Listening to serious radio with the silly face
All these bitches hatin' yeah I oughta name them Will & Grace
Gotta fat chance, I can fill the space

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
I said please miss, I don't believe it
You touched me once I could feel it
Ain't no way that I'd ever leave it
We could float way up to the ceiling
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me
They can't hold me down, can't hold me down

[Verse 2: Tayyib Ali]
Young boss man, they ain't heard of me though
Off top the convertable flow, and everywhere that I go
I seem to need you, so you know I'm gonna to do anything I need to
Hold up
They say I changed, picture that with a polaroid
We in the fast lane, you hear the motor roarin'
I had to pop-shove-it, cause you went overboard
I left charlotte still ballin like I'm Okafor
And they know they can't hold me down
Hoodie we on top this go around'
It's hard to holla' at you, cause I'm outta' town
In the sky, but they manufacture me from the ground
Nineteen with the dream of having it all
I need big money, so I'm stacking it all
You be my main girl, and I can be a dog
You'd be here when I'm up, just be down when I fall

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
Nowadays my phone don't ring, text don't blow up
Head so big that my neck won't show up
But, I'm up and at 'em, keep it moving, know the deal
Got a super bad broad but she doing Jonah Hill
And my suit is half off and my ties all knotted
These hippies really love me because my buzz organic
They pick me at the market stick their pitchforks on it
Then they stick me in the garbage like the shit's got rotten
Man I'm sick to my stomach so I guess I'm Johnny Appleseed
Warren Sapp on me the way I go and tackle beats
Dude I meant I tackle bait, fishing for these compliments
You Mickey D's with condiments
I'm Licky Lee with confidence
That's got me on these continents, I'm on to the next place
Got a little love, I don't even need a sex tape
Gotta' live it up, I don't even need an X-Ray
They see through all bull homie, exnay

[Hook](2x)[Hook x2: Hoodie Allen]
You give me some bad advice
I hate when you ask me over
You drunk off a glass of wine
No wonder I'm acting sober
So cut me out of your life
And leave me like class is over
But when the day goes, and the night comes
I'll still be your Casanova

[Verse 1: Skizzy Mars]
Well we sippin' tonight
I swear if you getting reckless then I'm dippin' tonight
Livin' the life
Real cold, drippin' in ice
Sick of the fights
Up and down, left to right
It's Myles with a 'y'
Now they gettin' it right (right)
So let me know why I gotta let you go
Why we always breakin' up
Why I ever left you fo'
You might leave but I know you can't shut the do'
Cause when love is pain we just love it mo'
The chaos and stress is what we covet fo'
Debatin' and going through our Phases, uh
Dumb and young, livin' life with no patience
Volatile conversations
We break up next, and make-up sex, I hate my ex
You tell your friends
Will it ever end?
We know we shouldn't
But we just do it all again, again

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Uh, these are days of our lives
Only thing I really care 'bout: stayin' alive
Treatin' the hotel like Les Miserables
Knockin' on the door like "is there a part-ay?"
With no authority, we young and we starvin'
Probably should've bought an apartment
Cause when it gets started
I beginning to feel like an artist
Women showing me love like I was born in the Heartland
30 bitches piled in and we so deep
20 women on the couch and they on me
10 hoes tryna figure where my rank goes
Looking in my bedroom and takin' my mementos
Oh, and I don't ever need it
I got the best broad, you can call me an elitist
And you be runnin' up, you can call that an achievement
I be plantin' all these seeds so you can call me when I'm leaving awwwww

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yea, G, Okay, guess it's my turn
Bitches speculate on money I earn
But they don't see nada it's not their concern
I just let them partake in the mary I burn
Yeah, 10 girls all around me
A couple of us split a brownie
One brought a whiskey bottle, tryna drown me
I'm tryna take her to the other room for round three
After parties at my hotel every night
I swear it feels like groundhog day
She thinks my lifestyle is hella tight
I'm like, yeah that's what they all say
So let the song play and think of me when I'm gone
I know that I'm wrong
But you can leave the light on
Until next time, I'll see you and your entourage
When you need a Casanova, then I'll oblige

[Hook][Intro]
Hoodie...

[Verse 1]
Yeah and I swear to never let this moment pass me
I give'em my all on these tracks like an athlete
Made it to the pros and they salary capped me
Mom said I should of stayed in school, Degrassi
Sorry Drizzy, I just made it to the college path
But things ain't even adding up like it was college math
So give me a minute to figure and I'll holla back
Where the nonbelievers, fuck'em, I never acknowledge that
Knockin' on the door, Jehovah's my witness
And I'm forever goin' 'til Hova will witness
I'm over my business, I'm entrepreneur shit
Cause she's my investment and damn it is gorgeous
Can't get caught up in this world but I love it
A lot of people throwing in they hands like they're puppets
All that shit changed when the drum kicks
Shia Lebouf, transforming what we do into dumb hits

[Hook]
You know that I gotta go chasin' my dream
Been doing it big since I was a teen
Moving way too fast for y'all to stop me
Oh, not me, oh, oh, not me (2x)

I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm being honest, sometimes it's easy to burn out
When you don't really know how the future will turn out
I'be been in school so the one that I learn now
Is all the work I puttin' in will equal what I earn out
And that's just economics in the perfect universe
A place where every girl I meet is saying "you the first"
And the crowd is singing with me like they knew the verse
Thank the law for gravity, it's grabbin' me unto the earth
So even though I really wanna be a star sun
I can't ever leave my town like a pardon
Beause it made me who I am, bar none
Tell Long Island I'ma burn it down like our sun
So we can raise it back up like it's our son
Make'em play our song everyday like it's Carson
Came along way but I still feel far
I hope they understand how real we are

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know the feeling with the buzz on vibrate
Spanish girls say I'm one fine hombre
What could be better than this baby cause I'm great
Take'em out to dinner, it didn't matter if I'm late
Cause y'all wait, I don't even play son
Ain't no competition I got the race one
Haters wanna shoot me down with they ray guns
I'll pull out the Ray Bands, you ain't gonna say none

[Hook][Intro]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Said I feel so sweet they compare me to Nestle
That's why you stay cravin', Wesley
Never had a girl go that far to impress me
But I just gotta keep it at bay like the Chesapeake
And on the bedsheet beat until she cardiac
And you be diggin' down my pants like an artifact
Know I'm always on the move like an army brat
So let me back it up, word to Charlie Batch
And my plan it has hardly hatched
I just love when we improvise
So if she turn around and say she isn't into me
Then I'mma turn around and say she isn't into guys

[Pre-Hook: Hoodie Allen]
So what you do to me
All I really want is you to move with me
All the things you do are feeling new to me
Cause I wanted you to act foolishly

[Hook: Flight Facilities]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone

[Bridge: Hoodie Allen]
Say no matter what we do
We gon', we gon' crave you [x4]

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Some stare at me but you stare through me
This ain't my first time don't think I'm a noobie
I got a minute let's get in it like a room key
I ain't a player but I try like Rudy
So all these dudes be judged like Judy
I do them on my court but they got no claim
We can turn this red eye to a soul plane
As long as we stay fly the rest of you so plain
She been waiting 'till I blow like propane
But I ain't never going ahead the Rogaine
Find me on the web I'm asking your domain
I'm at your doorstep, I'm at you so lame

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah, so silly they saying that they can love me
No Chappelle we gotta wrap it up, B
She ain't leaving 'till I slay like Buffy
And we don't mind when it's rough, Rugby
So don't trust me I came in the room
Scent so musty she sprayed her perfume
This is big time I can pay per the view
And it ain't Mayweather on the tube
So just, turn it a little bit up, it;s so fitted
And I never made a joke about us, it's no kidding
Gotta deliver what's written and such, but no feeling
Give the people what they want until I make a couple million for you[Intro](4x)
Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you
Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you -ou- ou

[Verse 1]
Alright, look, just a day dream, just another memory
Just another beat to rock, just another melody
My mind sprinting like it's trying to get ahead of me
When we out in public you been actin' like my enemy
Sorry to Obey, another def reference
It don't even matter we get paid like severance
Seven figures in my bank account
And you wonder why I'm payin' when I take them out
Say it now like tourettes if I'm bout to me next
Then why's it kinda feeling like the opposite
I'm playing down like the Mets, so I found that it's best
To be the underdog cause no one likes the obvious
The lobby is filled with people
They robbin' us, I'm Robin Hood, I'm stealing back
Probably never popular but stoppin' us up in our tracks
Quicksand, fame is not a quick plan
I don't plan on going home
I plan on going big man

[Hook](4x)
Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you
Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you -ou- ou
(I hit her with the )

[Verse 2]
No matter how hard I deny it, it's time to face maturity
Pops telling me to get a job with security
Surely, but with my girl steady trying to hurry me
It's got me asking questions, thinking twice about her purity
Nah, I shrug it off, that could never be the case
Told her "umm I bet I make these eggs in my face"
Just eggs and no hate, Bernie Madoff, she frauding
Play another show and I'll get another braud in the audience
It's always a promise, but I'll never call
Got'em wrapped around my finger, just like it's a tether ball
It's in satisfaction, later I'm feeling terrible
Cause I can't replace something that's uncomparable
Ha-ha, I'm just kidding, are you catching on, Jason Witten?
She said she's into fitness and wants to have my kids quick
I run out and tell her I'm that I'm late to handle business
I'm never coming back

[Hook](3x)

[Outro](2x)
Said that I'm thinking about
Something else that I can do
But thinking of you[Intro: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah
You're crashing in right now
It's Making Waves
By your new favorite crew
Hoodie Allen
We gonna start it off right now
With out further ado
We're coming live to you

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
People start to listen and they wonder if the beat break
I'll be rolling rich even if I rock the cheap skates
Life's a yearbook, never get a retake
And all the good times going faster than a speed date
You wonder why we late? Good question
Never thought we'd make it here now who'd guess it?
New lesson: Treat these moments like a blessin
I'm trynna find direction and you trynna GPS it
And no BSing on this roller coaster we thrilled
We just cut the line trynna get the seat filled
And now you're strapped in acting like we chilled
I know you love it when we go and let the beat build
We feel better then we ever been
I need to clear my head excedrin
I'm taking off to somewhere big and I be hoping that you getting in
But if you don't I know I'll see you when I get home
They say the road is just your favourite place to get grown
So for the people that I dissed and I led on
You can be the people that I miss when I head on

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
I feel so high tonight
I don't wanna see the ground
Don't look down, don't look down
Life can be so simple
When living in the clouds
Don't look down
Don't look down

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Ain't no better time than the present
Maybe if we never count the future
And I promise if I said it then I meant it
And I never meant to be the one to shoot your
Dreams down, see clouds and the sounds just opened up
And if they looking for a change then I hope it's us
I know it's tough, so is anything that's worth it
I'm making it my business to deserve it

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
I feel so high tonight
I don't wanna see the ground
Don't look down
Don't look down
Life can be so simple
When living in the clouds
Don't look down
Don't look down[Intro:]
These dreams, under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights

[Verse 1]
It's been a minute now so tell me where to begin
I meet a lot of girls but they gon' treat me like a vegan
Another given Sunday it's a given I'll be dreamin'
They say the flow goes so out of this world, Willie Beamen
Up, up to Scotty, I can keep me down, bulimic
I'm new to bein' Hoodie but I'm over bein' Steven
I'm sorry mom, I really like my name, I swear I'd leave it
But a wise man told me I'd be smarter not to keep it
So I keep it, keep it
We get down
The only road I know is like the steepest now
And I'm on the outside but they can't keep me out
Cause that's not the way that my life should be
I'm over all nights and a tight MC
No overalls, tights but I might envy the view
Who just do like exactly what they told to
You are all my boys blue, I don't kick it old school
Told you that everyday Thanksgiving that crazy flow
Livin' out my dreams and ain't a price that I'm a trade it for

[Hook:]
Put them dreams under my pillow, pillow
Put them dreams up, make it all cash
If I build it up, I can dream a little, little
I can dream big, I can dream fast

Put them dreams under my pillow, pillow
Put them dreams up, make it all cash
If I build it up, I can dream a little, little
I can dream big, I can dream fast

[Verse 2:]
I, I can't decide
In this life I'm so obsessed with every ten I see like a titan
Vince Young and restless, homie I need to fight it
I'm never indecisive, I'm team Jacob
I'm never into fighting your team
Wake up so alone, they've never been invited
To the places that I crash or the room I spend the night in
Fightin' the urge to not splurge and play it cool
Amateurs on stage, looks something like a play in school
Drama, live by a bunch of Mr. G's
Wonder why they haven't taken off, what a mystery
Karma, everybody that hits repeat
Wonder why we haven't learned yet, well history
I'm honored, please get down and kiss the feet
If the shoe don't fit the beauty then it can fit the beast
Goner, like with the wind that fits the piece
Tell them suckers I know that I ain't ever missed a beat

[Hook:]
Put them dreams under my pillow, pillow
Put them dreams up, make it all cash
If I build it up, I can dream a little, little
I can dream big, I can dream fast

Put them dreams under my pillow, pillow
Put them dreams up, make it all cash
If I build it up, I can dream a little, little
I can dream big, I can dream fast

[Bridge:]
Now a days I got so much on my mind right
Left side brain but i'll see you when the time's right
I'm feelin' shallow baby, this gon' be your blond night
Left side brain but i'll see you when the time's right
Now a days I got so much on my mind right
Left side brain but i'll see you when the time's right
I'm feelin' shallow, uh, I'm feelin' shallow, uh, I'm feelin' shallow
Baby tell me when the time's right

[Hook:]

Put it up[Verse 1]
I am just a man on my own
(La da da da da da da)
Tryin' find a place I belong
(La da da da da da da)
I don't want your money, I don't need no fancy clothes
I'd rather be with you when I am broke
Cause you use me just a little bit
You try to confuse me when we're intimate
You'd rather accuse me but I'm innocent
I'm not gonna lose sleep over sentiment

[Hook]
I feel dumb, dumb,  dumb for loving you
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for trusting you
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb when I'm done with you
Cause ain't no one that can fuck with you

[Verse 2]
They callin' me the people's champ
(La da da da da da da)
But everything you do is a sham
(La da da da da da da)
I'd rather just hang with my friends
Sometimes I think that things will change
And then I land in your bed
And it don't feel like it's the first time
You're everything I want and you're not mine
You keep saying I can live without him
I say put your money where your mouth is
Come back to me when it feels right
Kiss me so hard you make me fight
One more time, just one more time, just one more time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Real talk, I'm the white boy to you Wes Snipes
I'm East Coast but it's all love on the Westside
Your girlfriend is a close friend of my bedside
She want Ds, and I ain't talking the breast size
Everybody in the club getting reckless
You go home at midnight, we stay out till breakfast
I cash checks and you cancel them
You make calls but there ain't nobody answering
I want a smart girl who gives brains like it's charity
Every night a Friday night, me and Lyla Garrity
On another level, ain't nobody that compare to me
These bitches going dumb trying to marry me

[Hook x2]It's the young Johnny Depp in rap, you find me on Jump Street
Something 21 man, we jumping over dumb beats
Other rappers are Lunchables, basically they're lunch meat
I be up on your girl like a scrunchie, bump me
I'm juiced up so I spit it with a passion
You should check my raps with an asterisk
Comparison is not fair, why bother to ask him?
Haters getting lost like John Locke in the casket
Mack it, in the mouth any imitation that we come across
Student to the game, yeah I take the summer off
The vacations, y'all stay waiting
I'm a surgeon on the mic, I gotta thank you for your patience
And while we cuttin' up these tracks, no scapel
I was born to be a winner, no raffle
Obie stitching up this sick beat, no hassle
All about the beaver, parents think I'm Eddie Haskell

[Hook](2x)
I been, I been doing it
I been, I been rocking
I been, I been doing it
I-I-I-I been rocking
I been, I been doing it
I been, I been rocking
Hoddie Allen make the whole world go round and say

We Hoodie Allen, give you shit to make you feel nice
Take you to heaven, you living Jessica Biel's life
Other people bit us, but they never seem to steal right
We are on a world tour, tell me what if feels like
Real, my ill take way long to flock us
We love New York, y'all John Rocker
Life is a bitch, can't remember when it started
So I just talk smooth, baby keep it guarded
I'm in your insides like where your heart is
I'm Doctor Strangelove, you've been bombarded
I'm never of the people, love the talk shit
I'm to busy waking up to people who ignore it
Fuck it if they snoring, y'all are tryna ass me
Never gonna give you up, call me Rick Astley
Tailgate rap 2009, y'all can't pass me
Watch Obie go and lay the track so nasty

[Hook](2x)

[Outro]
Hoodie Allen make the whole world go round and say (5x)[Verse 1]
Party over here, call up everybody we know
This is for the women who be feeding off my ego
Tell 'em that I made it, cause I listen to my haters
Took what that said and negated, yeah I played it like I'm Tebow
Poor me out another one, take a shot and reload
Girls be waiting for me, got 'em lining up like freethrows
Everywhere that we go they say I'm their favorite
But I see that you've been faking, baby I know how to make it
In America, doing what we love and we passionate
Your girl is cashing in, Kourtney Kardashian
You pulled up with some honey bee's, and I pulled out with half of them
Cause I ain't going home if I ain't going with the baddest chick

[Hook]
Thumbs up to my friends drinking whiskey
Peace out to the girls that will miss me
Middle finger to the dudes back in high school
Cause you peaked at 18 cool, oh-ooh
Cause you peaked at 18 cool, oh-ooh
You make me look so good

[Verse 2]
Nights be getting kind of cold, and lonely on the interstate
You be pushing sixty five, and I be pushing sixty eight
Just to stay a head of you, and prove that we the best right?
Life is just a highway, but homie there's no test drive
Grab your girl and lets ride, take you where I'm supposed to be
Cause I'll be back to earth someday, and you'll be baggin' groceries
Or trying to sell insurance, but this right here a sure thing
You wake up with nothing on your plate, oh you poor thing
Cause I did what I want and I made my dreams reality
These bitches be caking off what I'm making like Sara Lee
Looking through my year book said I would succeed quick
Throwing out my salary, cause I don't ever need shit

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Four years, gone by, look back and you're out of your prime
But the cool kids never gonna miss me
It's all history, it's all history
Four years, denied, fuck that let's party tonight
But the cool kids never gonna miss me

[Hook]
