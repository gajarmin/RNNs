Million 5 on the Visa card
Hundred bands still look like the fuckin' Titans (football player)
Nigga servin' great white like I'm feedin' sharks

Somethin' wrong with the pussy
Even though I ain't gon' hit it, I'ma still make sure that she gushy
Me and my woadie, we don't get caught up like that, no way

Niggas couldn't see me if they had a genie
I'ma live my life like Bennie, R.I.P. my brother Bennie
I stack them racks to the ceiling, now these niggas can't beat me
I just might wake wantin' Chanel and these bitches can't see me
I'm in a whole other league
I ain't got AIDS but I swear to God I would bleed 'til I D.I.E
28 floors up I feel like I could F.L.Y.E.E
Pee on top of these bitches
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me
(I'm in that Corvette with baby mommy gettin' sloppy toppy)
I'm bleedin' red like a devil, I see these bitches plotty
They wanna know how I got M's and I didn't finish college

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
I do it for my daddy, I do it for my mama
Them long nights, I swear to God I do it for the come up

Money on money, I got commas in every bank
Sunday through Monday I've been grindin' with no sleep
Talkin' 'bout takin' somethin' from me, like no way
Thugga Thugger, that's my brother, brother
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle, knuckle
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot yah
Punchin' on the gas, too fast, and I lose yah
Give me a bed, and I'll do her, I want her head, Medusa
I swear a nigga gone cause this strong I'm blowin' super
Grindin' for a new day

[Intro]
What you tell them Thugger!

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'ma pull up, eat on that pussy and dip
I'ma keep one inside the chamber like Wilt
Baby girl spoiled and she spoileder than milk
And keep her on my side like a fuckin' hip
She gon' make sure I survive, she gon' do it well
Baby I just want them thighs right under that belt
She just want me to keep them lies all to myself
Word, she gon' help me like she's Santa's elves

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
She gon' look over these bitches like terms and conditions
I'ma move her out the trenches and buy her a Bentley
I'ma fuck her then hold on to her like she gon' miss me
I'ma pull on that wavy hair cause it's Indian Remy
I grab the key, she wanna ride with me
She tied the knot so she can die with me
She say she can do the same thing as 5 bitches
(So what you do?) So I went and fired them 5 bitches
She the B-E-X-T, bext
She ride me, 200 on that pussy like a T-Rex
I won't stop lovin' her, no way, no way, I'ma invest
In her
(What you tell em Thugger?)

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I had to hit her from the back then dip up out it
I don't know what it is but it's somethin' about her
When she around she do somethin' to me, I can't doubt it
I don't know what it is, but it's some' 'bout her
Shawty got me fucked up, blowin' O's, no Audi
Her ex nigga, he fucked up and I don't give no fuck about him
But I'll do whatever when it come down to shawty
The feds askin' questions, I don't know shit about it
Somethin' 'bout lil shawty that I can't put my finger on
It's somethin' 'bout lil shawty, she rather text, she don't be on phones
It's somethin' 'bout lil shawty, say it, that got Rich Homie gone
Shawty the best in my eyes and I know
She don't do fashion and she don't even go outdoors
Before she was ready you already knew I know
Shawty made me sick, I'm feelin' like I got a cold
Can't forget about my bro
What you tell em Thugger?

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Bridge: Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug]
It's somethin' about her, Thug, it's somethin' 'bout her
What it be? She got my life, I wanna wanna rob her, don't take it
Not Young Scooter but all she know is count up
She countin'
I'm on her front end like a fuckin' blouse
I'm on her head like a fuckin' bounty
No hunter
I'ma eat her like I'm hungry at Benihanas

[Intro: Travis Scott]
Mamacita, cita, cita
Mamacita, cita, cita

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
This the last days to the rodeo, last night
Had me down in the back, comatose, don't think
Sun shades and a pill gon' help
Once I'm gone, can't tame myself
Mamacita, cita, cita
You know I really need yah, need yah, need yah, right now
She get freaky when the... light's down
The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down
With the head first, got her straight out of the night gown
Nothin' like the light-skinned mamacitas in H-Town
They got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it
3-D money, no illusion
Depending if I'm feelin' bougie
Might hit your line bitch

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan (Travis Scott)]
Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her
And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita
Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)

Mothafuck a girl

Aye fuck her, I wanna fuck her mother
Just might give her my little girl
No, no, I won't let go, roll down, oh
She look the best with a fro, natural nat-nat on go
Damn, Quan, turn on the stove, whip it 'til I have a stroke
I do not fuck with America, I get it straight off the boat
Oh damn, the kush it never make me choke
Slow down, I'm speedin' and I got a trunk full of wham
Damn, 25 thousand on an old school Cam
SS me, these bitches wanna molest me
Damn, they'll sex me, she a lesbi
She want chicken like sesame
And she tryin' to undress me, test me
Give her hotel keys like Cassidy, 'u digg'?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
That's my bad little college ho
That I got on the east skirts of Decatur
Best believe that she cover Rich Homie Quan like a blazer
I smoke a lot of weed, keep my music turned up, fuck my neighbors
I fuck a nigga bitch and turn her like a table
Aye, I’m still practicin' so you know I’m gettin' greater
Aye, still wearin' long socks and shorts like Fabo
He was hatin' at first, now he tryna make the payroll
Got a stupid bitch who do whatever I say so
Money on my head like a Jesus piece
Blunt, now I'm higher than Khalifa be
Bad bitch lookin' like a Filipina
Ohh, you're killin' me, ohh, remember me
You, finna be, deceased if you keep callin'
Therefore I

[Hook][Produced by DJ Mustard, Co-Produced by Mikely Adams]

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I said that I’mma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I’mma die with my finger on the trigger
I’ve been grindin outside all day with my niggas
And I ain’t goin' in unless I’m with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafucking niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga

[Verse 1: YG]
First thing's first I love all my niggas
This rap shit cracked and I involve my niggas
You lookin' for some lean, lemme call my nigga
He sell it for the high, I need all mines nigga
Some niggas smoke smoke, some niggas drink drank
Got niggas on the block with the Glock that don't think
I said, "that's a nigga back up," they in a bucket lapped up
I got to act right if you niggas wanna act up
He talkin' like a snitch no, that ain’t my nigga
He trippin' off a bitch no, that ain’t my nigga
Take a nigga case, yeah that’s my nigga
Know him since I was eight, yeah that’s my nigga
Fucked my first bitch, passed her to my nigga
Hit my first lick, passed with my nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause I’m down for my niggas
I ride for my niggas, fuck them other niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Just know I'm down with the niggas down for me
I got two words for you, love and loyalty
It was me and my nigga, trippin' on a half a B
Then we used to hit a mall and buy everything we see
Me and my down ass nigga get twisted
Nigga get to trippin', knock the gravy out your biscuit
Just know I fucked with you the long way, my nigga
So when I see you out I’m like, "Hey, my nigga!"
Drink that act right by the case, my niggas
Drink that act right and get straight with my niggas
Me and my nigga ridin' dirty trynna chase them figures
Who got the yopper, who got the yola? Don’t matter, go figure

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
My nigga got cake, my nigga got weight
My nigga fronted me, he the reason I’m straight
My nigga got a house, my nigga got a lake
My nigga we eatin', my nigga get a plate
And we're still hittin' licks, my nigga, my nigga
Runnin' off a nigga shit, my nigga, my nigga
I fucked a nigga bitch with my nigga, my nigga
If a nigga talkin' shit then he ain’t my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
YG my nigga and I ain’t goin' in, ain't trynna leave my niggas
Shawty seein' me and want to leave with a nigga
But it wasn't enough room cause I came with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas
I need a set of wings cause I’m too fly, nigga
And I’m all about my business like a suit and tie nigga
I ride for my niggas (Believe that)

[Hook]

[Outro]
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah...[Intro: Rich Homie Quan].......
Came in at first, had bad luck
Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had nothin'
We done sold out, now everybody mad at me
Tell 'em roll out, now everybody smashin'
Get ready cause you know we 'bout to be a problem
Hope you ready cause you know it 'bout to be a problem

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes
Paper chase, vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, boy, better check your tone
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me
Preferably one of the best
She ridin' cause we next now and forever to death
Be loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest
We just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Got no time to waste
And no way these niggas stoppin' me, oh no
Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
And I can do this with my eyes closed
Blindfold two times over
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over
Talkin' on Melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's defeat to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
That's cold cutting
And I've been this dope for like four summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake
I know this shit that bone you pick
Might leave you niggas fillets

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YG]
It's YG 4hunnid!
Is you ridin'?
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence
If Jimmy got caught up, but you was right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet??
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake-friend syndrome
There's no cure so them symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be something
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this, this, and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker
For me and my day one hittas

Mr. CEO is what my title say
Me and my homies G'd your ho, he feel some type of way

[Verse 1]
Okay, now let's be real I know you feel some type of way
When I get to biting on her ear she make that Tyson face
I drop down to my knees thankful for life today
No naps just long sleep; hibernate
I can tell if he 12, right away
Go through hell cause I care, move you far away
Drop you off late, know he feel some type of way
I got hoes like golf trynna make what Tiger makes
I got a hide away, and I go there sometimes, to give my mind a break
I find a way, to still get through the struggle, what I'm tryna say
And I ain't lying today when I tell you that I love...

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She got a Georgia peach on her rear end like a licence plate
No rookie, girl scout cookie got me high today
I probably make, more money in six months
Than what's in your papa's safe
Look like I robbed a bank
I set it off like Queen Latifah, cause I'm living single
I'm feeling cautious, I ain't scream when they served a subpoena
I heard that he the leader, come follow my tribe today
I fucked her now he heated, he feel some type of way
Don't know how to say, ain't the hardest man working?
Attention we pay, there's always a man lurking
No man perfect, but God
My head, I nod
Rich, homie, ugn...

My flow hard to bite for all you stale eaters
And I'm still smart as hell like a Yale teacher
Pneumonia, I'm hot-headed, rare fever
Foul call, no foul ball, play fair, people
I tell Bone that I'm a young nigga, worth some car lots
Two cellphones and a pistol, I call shots
I'm tripping, money shoestrings stacking tall knots
I'm living, doing new things I never thought about
No sick days on my job description, no calling off
My ho gone, I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin
How could I know, she ready to go?
House full of hoes, reality show
She sat in the ghost, no Casper, it'll go faster than it appear
And that's a Phantom, not a real ghost so don't fear
And them double letters on the Rolls Royce
And I'm Ronald Reagan in that building, bitch
Real recognize real, well I know Richie Rich
I got Dutch Masters for the kush smokers
Hold the reggie for the bush toters
"Fuck blacks," what Bush told us, fuck that, we took over
I bust back like a foot soldier, give you good gas like a shook soda
Bulldozer, he cook cola, no haircut, give you the part
Asshole, but I'll do the Bart, Margie's not cool with her
Lisa mad I'm on Simpson, for real, and Homer say he through with her
Molly make your heart beat fast, I bought me a house across from Mia's house
And Maggie in the backseat laughing, calling me Daddy
I ain't your Papi, I'm pimpin' out of three cars
Speaking of the Simpson, I ain't even mention free barsI got to many hoIntro: Rich Homie Quan]
I was in Houston for the minute now I’m back in town (x2)
Rich Homie Baby!

[Verse 1: Propain]
All it takes is one text
Asking me where I’m at
Told her,” Baby I’m on one but your destination is next”
Now I’m coming down on that freeway that UGK in my deck
Got that “Take It Off “on replay like Pimp C said it
Now she texting me she need it bad because she ain’t have good in so long
And I’m like,’Damn shorty I’m speeding fast and when I get to you girl it’s on’
And when I make it there I want to see that ass no boy shorts and no thong
She got that ocean hair have a nigga sinking quick
Rock the boat on my Aaliyah shit
I hit the block and showed up in a beastin’ whip
Ciroc is poured up and Keisha lit
I know your neighbors probably never heard of me
But they gon’ know my name when you screaming it
Cause I'm going in, going in
At The same time I'm showing out
Got her legs shaking, rolling round
And her head crazy like a robot

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I could tell she had her shit when she smiled
Shorty lil dramatic but it compliment her style
Late nights we get romantic
Need a babysitter for her child
If I whip her she like ooooh child
Imma hit that pussy all night wake up another two rounds
Living room got like 8 pictures we done knocked another two down
Two!
Yeah, Yeah
I was in Houston for the minute now I’m back in town (x2)

[Verse 2: Propain]
She ain't worried about no nigga
Got a her own bread  got her own business
Laced up and it's a velvet  [?]
Silent niggas think she gold digging
Truth be told she got more than you
So what the hell you think she need with your figures?
Ain't nothing better so I drop whatever
I'm going down when she call
Really ain't nothing with her it go down whatever
From the bedroom to the wall
It's the ones who bad with hustle that never ask for nothing  that a nigga want to give all
Everytime I hit it man I need some more I notice
I can't resist it's when the dope is potent
Shorty ride this dick just like a roller coaster
Likes to drive it quick then in a slower motion
I be hitting it like I got sentenced to life
I’m going dumb I’m so unfocused
It’s a trill nigga, trill nigga; all she want is a trill nigga
Most you lames couldn’t deal with her
I knock it out
[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
I got this lil quiet bitch who never said shit
She thick as hell she stripping dreams and she from Texas
I'm well protected baby Jesus on my necklace

I said I was in Houston for a little minute now I’m back in town
Rich Homie Baby!

[Verse 1 – Propain]
I’m coming just wait for me baby
[?] on my cup, girl I’m faded
Pull up, I’m hoping you naked
I’m on it, I’m feeling impatient
She open the door, she got no clothes
I take it there
Straight to the floor, yeah the bed look good
But we probably won’t make it there
Young Propain, baby scream my name
And I love how you say that there
Going in, got her in the zone, feeling strong
I'mma make her moan till the neighbors hear
Shawty ride like a foreign with the missing brakes
[?] down, side to side, make a figure eight
She be down to do whatever young nigga say
When I hit it I'mma live up in it like it’s real estate
Black diamond, yellow diamond, look like kitty play
Bend her over one time, make it ricochet
Ass so fat, down in the pillowcase
Eyes rolling, got her legs doing the thriller shake
Trill, one round I ain’t never heard of that shit
Fucking with a G, I'mma put you straight to sleep
Get some money bands out the [?] murder that shit

[Hook - Rich Homie Quan]
I could tell she had her shit when she smiled
Shorty lil dramatic but it compliment her style

[Verse 2 – Kevin Gates]
Hold up, cut up, I don't get tired
(Get em Gates!)
I was in school for a semester now I'm back in town
I go to war with God behind you, ain’t no backing down
Hollering loud, you lay flat on your stomach
Both hands on your back when I'm knocking you down
Blowing loud while on the freeway, riding around
Denim be sagging, no mention
Unintentional, judging the book by the cover
Uncanny how we sharing similar interests
Just calling, you know that I'm loving your voice
Keep talking bae, I'mma just listen
Broke down a nugget of griggety
Rolling a spliff and I’m watching her twist it
Tattooed up everywhere, scratching my back
So I'm picking her back up, we shaking
Making love to a gangster on side of a banger
Her man run in here, I'mma blank him
Diamonds is sparkling, she know I'm retarded
My tongue is inside of her ear
Gently removing Victoria’s Secret
While up in her guts from the rear

My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin (I ain't trippin ho)
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I  [?] swear to god, Quan ain't trippin
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I want to seal it
These bitches wanna fuck us, we the realest
Like it or not, brain shoot to the ceiling
So many clothes in the closet, she looks like dealer
Ran up my racks with Rich Homie we're like the pilgrims
Pull out 4 of that super clean (lean, lean)
I got jelly beans in my billie jeans
I got Quan back cause I know he got my scene

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Dad told me never trip about no bitch
Daddy told me to stay down and they're gonna lose
Granny told me pray to God, that's what I did
Gotta make a way for my kids
[?] flying higher than a blimp
Eating on shrimp, looking down at the shrimps
If you see me with a limp, don't mistake me for a pimp
The 40 get heavy when you tote it on your hip
Me and Thug ready, going in for the kill
And Imma look confused

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Got racks on racks on racks
I got zippers on all of my shoes
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin (pussy nigga I wanna be you, psych)
Diamonds black, I'm a walking night
Play with Thugger, scary sight
No shoestrings in these shoes, so I ain't tripping
I ain't worried bout shit, cause I got zippers on all of my shoes

[Hook][Hook]
Pain on my sleeve, dont know why I walk around with it
All niggas, they changed on me, claiming they were down with me
Im oh so hot they looking like some underground niggas
So much on my mind, ain't got time to worry about these niggas
Can't worry about these niggas
Can't worry about these niggas
I swear to God on everything, I can't worry about these niggas
Its like money be made, I can't worry about these niggas
Hundred K in a week on payday, I ain't worried about these niggas

[Verse 1]
I ain't worry about these hoes and I ain't worry about no money
You ran out with that pit of weed, I ain't worried about no honey
I got two spats on the same street, so you know a young nigga banking
Feel like in front of my time, you know a nigga worry about nothing
See, I got a lot to hurt on my bun, when the cop parked you know I had to run
Hot by the beat, gotta be right on, beat by the Benz, I ain't talking no pun
No grey hair, young nigga like me ain't worry about nothing
Won't play fair, we got big money, we ain't worry about fines
Come back nigga, kid run a pack, better run it back, nigga
My niggas thought off, they dont go for that, nigga
Shoot you in the front, dont turn your back, niggas
Feeling like Kanye, fuck your picture
Tie your momma and fuck your sister
Hide motherfucker, feeling like a million
Dont dismiss em

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hundred K in a week, why you there standing in that robe?
Twelve hundred on my feet, why you not stay in them clothes?
Cause you want that free, I ain't paying for no hoes
I got a hundred rounds in that chopper cause a lot of these niggas phony
I ain't worry about these niggas, I bust in this place, eat sugars
Im balling on my pivot, I got a magazine full of missions
She fishing, Imma start the niggas like the bishop
Got em working for me and my business
I hope you ain't singing shit cause we torch around and Im with it
Got all nigga, yeah, yall niggas

I can't slip and fall in it, Im a moss but Im a fine nine nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
I ain't worry, no, no, I ain't worry

Ask about me in the A and theyll tell you the same story
My bitch probably fucking my nigga but you know that I ain't worried
I ain't worried, I swear to God I ain't worried
I ain't worried about shit
I ain't worried, put my money, hop a bitch
I ain't worried, I ain't worried

And she's been here for 3 days, it's time to get back around the world
I've been all around the world

[Verse 1]
First class, flyin' overseas, young nigga just got a passport

Don't play... a nigga like me cause you might get your ass whooped

Have your ass cryin' like the nigga in Boys N The Hood
When 12 said "Hands up"
I'm dope, boy you Tre, scary, hopped out the car
Pussy nigga need to man up
I done ran my bands up
3 times I performed in Savannah
I've done been around the world
Wisconsin twice, now I'm goin' back to Atlanta

If you don't know numbers, that's them NYC streets
I cannot be beat
I'm a real OG
Don't fuck with y'all niggas, you could be the police

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That private jet on the runway, waitin' for me and you, baby
We gettin' escorted, no TSA, had to work my move, baby
And I've been everywhere in the USA, I stay on the move, baby
And I ain't ever been to London, but I heard how the food tastes
Ugh you stank, Mortal Kombat, kickin' shit in here, mothafucka
Like I'm Liu Kang, I'm the bomb
I'm Saddam, but a nigga strapped like Hussein
I'm talkin' guns, out of Pakistan, a nigga might talk some new things
Still on the west side, might catch me at the Blue Flame
I've been all around the world
LA my favorite: weather, women, weed be the greatest
When you get overseas, that's how you know you made it

And the banger but you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)
Ay, we gon' save that money
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on them
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L, The Jew Biz Major?
Fuck you know about the world he was raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away
Book flight December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get login's for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thotties, I disregard them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin', preacher
I can take his ass church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burb like a baby without no hiccup
I can...

[Interlude]
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know a full verse would have been to expensive anyways
I think

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie
Hair cut several months in-between, homie
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave, homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Air B&B the mother fucker, least I'm never there
I'm not in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it
401k rollin' over bands on it
Coppin' sweaters in the summer with the sail on it
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpay for it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count, hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shiz though
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin finch tho
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Kept the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Fetty Wap]
Everytime these niggas tryna play
And lately I've been stackin' up
Cause I'm bout the bands baby
100k underneath the bed baby

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing a long like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you
Than it need be, so think about it take a minute let it breathe B
But think about it bruh you saw me take the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp up in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kyke know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that [snicker]
You didn't... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]

Don't come if you ain't fuckin', fuck nigga, no I can't trust him
Lil Scrappy, yo head, I bust it
I was trappin', I couldn't get busted
Had packages on them buses, I'm rappin', I came from nothin'
I got 'em like, "What, what? Aye"
Money on your head, nigga so don't play
With who? With me, I stay with a Glock, 40 G, every day
Thugger still ridin' with the chop
Red on the beam, won't stop me from shooting you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I add mud with the soda, I drink lean, never sober
We lean like Morgan Freeman, Quan leanin' on my shoulder
Ooh you niggas still green like a soldier
I need me two like I'm poking
Out  at the concert, show 'em you clap it like Magnolia
Ooh you need to show 'em you're the best at what you do
I just took off, I'm on a mountain, girl no dew
Ooh, said she wanna party
Young Quan voice, I leave these bitches with no choice
I don’t eat pork, I drink SmartWater like a dork
I'm not blowin' my money, lil' nigga, I'm not Scott Storch
Bought a bitch a Birkin bag, inside it was a Yorkie
You lil' nigga can't afford it

[Hook][Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Got a Pocket full of Hundreds and a closet full of clothes
With a Phone full of hoes and they trippin'
And yeah I know some partners and they throwed with some shawty by the door
With some killer niggas standing by the kitchen
And all my niggas got a bankroll, bankroll, bankroll on em'
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll on em' All my niggas keep a bankroll, bankroll, bankroll on em'
I can't go nowhere without no bankroll on me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got yo Ho on the score you know my unc on dope
A lil' short hand chopper under my peacoat
So how these hoes gon' stop the guap when the cops can't stop
I dropped my Iphone cracked it and my top subtracted
And i spend my money faster
I got on seven diamond rings like your pastor
I was ridin round with bricks in my trunk man
Same year that Jordan dropped the jumped man
I was in the county playin' tomp by the bunk man
[?] I gives a damn
Sellin gram after gram never credit card scam
Want some credit let a nigga hold your credit card mam
Give me pussy ass and mouth so I call the bitch P.A.M
Since Im saving all my money you should me young S.A.M
I been serving niggas debbie since a very young man
Got a stash box with a tammy gun in my damn van

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
4g auto straight 8 im on a high speed chase
200 on the interstate cause I can't catch no case
Tryna hit up gucci land but he won't pick up the phone
Thankin like El Chapo we can't loose no loads
I like to stack my money up I can't stand bankroll
36 ounces in the brick I add 4 more
Thats a 40 ounce brick you get it for 24
Old school like magic I no look past dope
I drop a brick just like buffalo just dropped T.O
I ain't never seen drop bricks drop out the float
Old school G.T.O bricks stuffed in the dope
And I don't stop at red lights everything is a go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bankroll Fresh]
Im a motherfuckin stoner I put that shit on my momma
Got my pistol with me now, you try me, bitch im a gun you
You ain't no boss you pussy boy you a motherfuckin runner
Fuck the Jury, the judge ,the prosecutor and your honor
I can make cocaine, vacay straight to columbia
Cadillac station wagon 4g's all up under
Got em' in, Got em' in, Got em' in,Got em' in
What you wanna spend im ridin' with that elephant
From the burg with these young niggas they got hearts in then
Im in the streets pussy niggas and no such thang as freinds
I might just pull up on your block with a ho block and a fo pot
Drop a fo walk what you wanna car key the door locked
Shooters gone pop

[Hook][Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Why my bitch cheating on me?
What the fuck I do to her?
I ain’t did nothing nigga
Why she wanna play with me?
My feelings done got involved
Nah that bitch can't stay with me
Swear to God on my Grannie
Rest in peace to, Annie
Now the bitch got two daddies
This a reunion, no family!
I wanna fuck you in your best outfit girl put in on, Yeah
David Copperfield, baby girl I can get it gone, Nair
You the picture, Imma put you on the wall
I’m the hammer, you the nail
Beat it up, Beat it up, Beat it up, Beat it!

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Put your ass to sleep, baby girl tempur-pedic
Cuhz whip it up, in a pan like Pita
Love big titties, turned on by them C Cups
Did a show in Boston drinking lean out a tea cup
No party, I’m sorry
Ridin’ round in the motorcycle, no Harley
That lil ho retarded, had to nickname lil bitch.. tortoise
Shootin’ shots, I ignore it
Pants saggin’ cause I walk around with that 40
Nigga talkin’ beef, eat it up cause I’m hungry
Fuck YARS, nigga im extortin’
Feelin’ like J-Prince nigga
J-Prince son Jas, fuck with me every time
I was in LA chillin’ at Jas Prince house
A deal, I ain't never signed
I ain't never ever ever lost shit
Kill a nigga, knock em off, what's a fuckin' lawsuit?
Shoot a nigga momma house up, no talkin’
(Shh) Too much talkin’…
Ran out with a 100 bands, I ain't playin'
Cause the promoter,thought I was playin'
Got a 2-2-3 Lebron James, Cleveland
Why am I insecure bout my woman?

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I don’t lick pussy but tonight I might eat it
I don’t want that shit lil bitch, I just want my receipt back
She grippin’ on my nuts, Michael Jackson I might beat it
Her first name Victoria, I know she got some secrets
I don’t wanna fuck with her, if she ain't gon’ keep it
Real with a nigga till the end, girl I need ya
Let me put my dick inside your hole, peep it
Thugga want your soul, he need it

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
She ain't got too many times, she got 3 stripes like an Adidas (Ay)
Let the lil bitch come roll me like tempur-pedic (Ay)
Throw that pussy, I catch it like a receiver play
If she find out I cheated, she might just leave that day
Put that lil bitch on her feet, no bengay
Jonesboro South raised me, that’s what kids say
And my diamonds they come wet like a fish tank
Lil money big bank take lil bank (Yeah)
Lil nigga wanna play, I’ll leave em in a wheel chair
Yellow bone bitch from Toronto, she a regular
When I kiss her, I be suckin on her neck like Dracula
And I’m a motherfuckin’ lion, nigga cats kill

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan][Intro]
Auto start that motherfucker Quan
Hahaa, yeah, aye

[Hook]
I just might pull up in that Bugatti
I just might pull up in that Ferrari
I just might pull up in that 4-5-8
I just might pull up in that new Spider
I pull up by myself no one behind me
Try a nigga like me 100 soldiers ridin'
I might pull up on you catch body
I pull up on you Thurdays, fuck a Friday
Boy bullets at yo head like a visor
Got niggas in the bushes and they hidin'
Plus they gone lay on you until you outside it
And they gone make it hard for folks to find ya
I hate to get involved with violence
But you done went too far and got beside yourself
Its only one me stop trying
Cause you could never beat me with the finest self

[Verse]
Pull up on that nigga with the beam
Yeah, what you want lil nigga
If ion't know you I ain't gone serve ya
Nah, what you want lil nigga
My P.O. know my piss dirty
Hmm, what you want from a nigga
I could switch cars up every Thurday
Park the big truck now I'm riding in the donk lil nigga
Shawty stay charged like a Tesla
And every car flexin'
Got a nigga question mark guessin'
I sound good thank the boy ?
Might strap catch ya
Ballin' on him like George Jetson
Pull up on a nigga with the windows down
Straight shots, shooting at everything we said lil nigga
You mad cause you heard I fucked yo bitch mouth
But a fuck nigga nah, I could never be a lil nigga
Gotta whole lotta money, more problems
Biggie said it, Biggie said it nigga I know it
Kickin shit on these niggas just like soccer
Catchin bullshit in the air just like a goalie
Went to private school nigga just to talk proper
70000 for the bust down rollie
Used to hide weed in my motherfuckin' locker
Boy I pray to God that car not stolen because...

[Hook]
I just might pull up in that Bugatti
