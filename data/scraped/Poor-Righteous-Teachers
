Roots!

Praise for the days when I couldn't get paid
In the fix on the mix in the damn projects
Cracks for the blacks but I couldn't sell that
Even though blacks couldn't get jobs and shit
Hit after hit from the Sugarhill Gang
Hear a Pow Wow, hear a Big Bang Bang
It was strange, I was broke but I still got the record
Even though I was poor and about butt naked
Rats in my front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley running styles for the crack
It was ill on the real, I be still bugging off it
In the ways I will walk it so today I can talk it
It's a shame how the games in the ghetto get played
On the cracks they paid for the tricks they laid
I'm afraid for the youth in this time we're living in
Just about 13 on the scene scrambling
Gambling small-time, apologize nice
I'm about to roll 10 7's for the crap I rolled twice
Rough business, it's a rich mon time
When you ain't got the loot, you resort to the crime
From the cess house, the youth house, the jail house, the Cult house
Where I perfected these skills I be doggin
Love to teach the facts but the brothers in the back
Can't see what I'm saying cause the blunt smoke is foggin
Still I proceed with degrees of the wisdom
Cause this shit's thick, it kicks and I know it
Lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto

From ghetto to ghetto, from project to project
Bookbag of lessons but I ain't have dough yet
From knowledge to wisdom, from wisdom to see
And understand me if you don't dance, G
It's a god in the house, it's a god in the house
And I'm godding it out, and I'm godding it out
I've come a long way, the strong way, the wrong way, I lived it
The right way, you might say, I got it, I'll give it
But praise for the days when I used to be tramp
And had to freeload of my Earth's food stamps
Til I stopped, paused, start the pop's stores
It was ill on the real, but who's to die for us?
Say that I rock my own community
Ain't a damn thing owned by the you or the me
It's Koreans I be seeing on the neighborhood corners
With the guns and the stores and love the ??? owners
So beg my parton, peace Natasha Harton
See I won't forget, I know for shit's starting
From my way to LA, from JA to UK
I am who I am, I say what I say
I gots no time to love a slave trader
Cause according to the constitution, they'll always hate us
Play this, say this, and say it like I said it
Cause a magazine edit can get your ass beheaded
I'm thorough breaded, black slave dreaded
The shit that y'all doing, I already did it!
But lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto

Praise for the days when I used to be trife
With a lack of understanding anything about life
So thanks to Malcom, Martin, Wylee Ferartin
Father Allah talk the talk that I'm starting
Peace to Elijah, we can't forget about ya
Teaching us how ta, get up out the
Project complex caves
Another damn rave for the damn ex-slave
My ghetto noise ringing from a project hallway
Don't want to hear my mom say "Blacks have come a long way"
How can she see that when we haven't eaten all day
Haven't had a job since the ending of the slave trade
Then they give us church, attempt to try and ease this
But I check it out, had to learn about Jesus
Told em he was black and they called me a hater
Then he's on the church wall, yeah like a slave trader
Something real funny's going on boy I'll tell ya
Send you up sell ya, free ya try to kill ya
Martin taught me much when he simply tried to love em
Brother all about peace but the devils had to snuff him, but
Lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto
Lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto[KRS-One]

[Wise Intelligent]
Yo, where the teachers went, with all that pro-black shit?
Where all the conscious niggas, who used to chat like this?
See, I remember yesterday when y'all was Gods and Earths
Egyptians and metaphysicists on the verge of giving birth
To understanding, and planting seeds that grow
Now everybody's on that bullshit about killing and so
Eat my pussy, suck my dick, well that's the size of the shit
So in the head of ignorance, I rip some conscious clip
Niggas is small, my task is educate y'all
Can you stop selling crack cause negro that takes balls
I'm on that road called freedom, seldom traveled by the multitude
I bring gifts of life, light, and some conscious food
God degree, cause see God's the size of me
And yeah, what's the difference with the west and the east
I feel there ain't no difference, so spread the news I spit
And since I got you listening, I guess I'll prove the shit
There's niggas is lacking over there, niggas is lacking over here
Some niggas is dying over here, and niggas is dying over there
Black youth don't follow them, because they don't know shit
They selling you death on that pursuit for Benz and Lexus
We gots to talk about, cause I'll reveal your ass
You can't shield your dirty thoughts with no five percent fact
Peep the jewels that I craft, see the fools that I class
I be schooling your ass, cause being truth is a task
And I am nothing but, I'm God-blessed nigga, what?
Take your hands off your nuts, and your lips off that blunt
Stand for something, stand erect, stand for this
You'll fall for anything cause you don't stand for shit
I murder slime, come wicked every time
And fill your mind with conscious rhyme

(It's nothing but conscious style)

[KRS-One]
You ever wonder why you ain't living how you should be living
Could it be your mentality you're giving off?
North, south, west, east, like an unchained beast
Your thoughts bringing you to deceased
I'll release a little piece with speed
Before the savage emcee proceeds to feed
Upon the minds of the minor, I find the antidote
To the empty emcee that thinks they dope
We ain't got too far to go
Opportunities are shutting down faster than this rhyme flow
One day you're in your sauna, next day a goner
You can sit and play games like Bugs Bunny if you wanna
Real bad boys used to move in silence, peep it
But now real bad boys seem to move in secret societies, a trip
Don't slip with your lip talking shit with your clip
Showing your ass as I blast into it
With a clip of conscious lyrical wit
KRS-One comes well equipped
You can follow me in a mass of one follow me in a mass of two turntables
You're listening to the sound now of the Profile label
With B.D.P.R.T
Yo Wise, tell 'em just what you see

[Wise Intelligent]
Niggas is talented, but they let it go to waste
I'm came to smack that ign'ant smile off your face
You're lacking knowledge of self and what I'm talking about
You niggas laughing but that's something you should cry out
Right now you're finding out is God is back up in the house
My weapon's in my mouth and watch how I can take you out
Intelligent, represent
Ignorance, slaughter it
Slangspit Entertainment
Run shit, on the planet
B.D.P., up on the mix
P.R.T., conscious lyrics
You're suffering
Niggas is sick, where's the Bufferin?
I hear that gangsta shit but let some conscious brothers hit
You know the type that fight, live and die for truthful rights
Not only that, we will kill for this righteous life
I'm on the mic for the purpose of shedding light
You take my life? Go fly a fucking kite
I'm infinite, I'm yesterday, today, tonight
Tomorrow morning, you see this is your future talking
Babylon is fallen, poor people of the world are ballin'
Black people calling for P.R.T. and what we talkin'
Black facts and shit like that
Dress and lack, get your head cracked
Rip tracks and refuse to come whack
(Yo P.R.T. them niggas' lyrics, you notice that?)
I learned this line, come wicked every time
And fill your mind with a conscious rhyme

KRS: Yeah, check it out one check it out

Lord, how you be, madam G, peace God
Fuck frauds, get yours, kick ass, leave scars
On Mars I built a school to study life on Earth
Thoughts burst, a million rappers murdered in the first verse
Now what's than eating dirt, being buried alive
Put to death by surprise in the name of black gods
Ain't I most fly? Young pie don't cry
Dry the tears from your eye and your lover might live
Like to give, like to take, never making mistakes
All wise enjoying everything right and exact
Poor facts, pro-black, Donnelly Homes projects
Learn that time is the same on Casio or Rolex
Knowledge James, chapter two, verse one through six
But try not to judge a man by the price of his kicks
We'll often talk shit co-workers worse than accents
Cause you know Jersey runs things every time boy
Build destroy, Clinton must make noise
Enjoy the fruits of life, need the wife and my boys
My seed won't need for anything, trust me
Black man, 'nuff land, eight hundred acres of trees
Please the seven seas travel regularly
Degrees consciously study everywhere we be
Family daring he who talks enough shit
And come and get the stitch to fix the split of the lip
This status shit provide us
We call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers black

[Nine]
Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

[Chorus]
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er

[Wise Intelligent]
Intelligent, twenty-three, now nineteen five
Hold the mic I'll rise right in front of your eyes
In here six years see what I felt every year
Oh yeah it's ninety-six I'm born and understanding, understood
Get the goods, build a school down south
In some remote location that nobody knows about
Teach, add on to the life that we live
God degree, twelve jewels, eat the foot that I give
No pig, strictly kosher mathematics and fact
Poor blacks on track mission to take the Earth back
Cause Whitey got it locked, that's why the whole world's lost
We wearing crowns made of thorns and being put to the cross
Lost souls futures told in the Dead Sea Scrolls
God reduced to a savage lacking soul control
Talking lots of shit about his drugs and guns
Several daughters, 'nuff sons, ain't trying to raise none, yo
Whoa-ho-ho, let me slow up with the flow
Can't move too quick because niggas got to know
The duty of the civilized is to civilize the uncivilized
And make the world recognize
That God is Wise, and Wise is God to the death
And back to life, you Lazarus and I'm the Christ
The forthcoming, like a thief in the night
The wave of light, the key to everlasting life
That shit provide us, to call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all

[Nine]
Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

[Chorus] (x2)
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er

[Wise Intelligent]
Since I've been away I've been thinking about
How gunslingers turned singers and black culture went out
Wake up all you teachers tired of teaching and wait
Grass roots, pass truth into the ears of black youths
Watch me talk the talk and walk the walk right now
As mystic as it seems, I bring for real to your dream seeing
Midnight marauder got it dipped off the block drug
Street niggas bug cause they know we do it for the love
We rose above every limit that they said we had
Who loves your ass enough to strictly educate the mass?
Come get your cash, fill your mind with swine and dash
For longevity, these niggas we will never be
You will remember we from now till forever gee
I am infinity, lyrics flowing endlessly
You ain't no friend to me so don't even pretend to be
Like O.J. Simpson be sleeping with the enemy
I call you out and make the world know your ass is lacking
Quoting some lessons but see no parts of understanding
You standing under my rain, snow, sleet, hail and thunder
That's why you wonder what's causing this to exist
I raise the mist, distill the myths of many currents
Don't be determined except to life forget the death
Nevertheless you're being blessed cause I'm who God is
Don't know the time niggas must be wearing Guess watches
Hands on your boxes, turn 'em up like seven notches
Your Magnavoxes amplify my super conscious
Shit providers, we'll call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all

Something for cave dwellers
Bomb mailers and gun sellers
The lie tellers, Cinderellas, and Goodfellas
The gun packers, crack backers, and loot stackers
Sam's crackers, New World Order is here actors
The globe holders, the population controllers
Disease makers a.k.a. AIDS creators
The cremators, doctors, nurses and nigga haters
That's out to get us, after making us bullshitters
The sister hitters who knock em and don't stay wit em
The human litter that whitey's about to get rid of
The same niggas supplanted the very planet
With mathematics, pure knowledge and understanding
Global famine, pursuit of the hidden manner, star spangled banner
Slave traders and kidnappers
We ain't just rappers, we changing some black situation
Teaching this nation the way to conquer stagnation
My occupation's to stimulate your elevation
To motivate and navigate through revelation

[Reprise: Wise Intellgient]
I shine the light that knowledge ignites
Excite blacks and whites through the things that I write
See, I could extend your days, send a spectrum of rays
In a westerly direction God is worthy of praise
Or I could capsize the planet, deprive you of life
Take flight, make ice of any emcees you like, I'm dat nice

[Hook 2X: Wise Intellgient]
Precise, could turn the days into nights
This mic like my life we elevate to great heights
We dat nice

Take these words home and think it through

[Verse 2: Wise Intelligent]
Word, life is what you make it holler to the almighty
Frighty Whitey never will learn to like me
My state of being as the all eye seeing, seeing human beings
On the brink of extinct
Mind vocalize only prove to incline
One time in time I turn the water to wine
Combine X and Y, created physical Gods
No lie because I heard that if I did I would die
This vi-olent envi-ronment
Full of crackatalism, politricks and 10%-ers
Who know the truth but hold it back from the youth
There's proof that Jesus Christ was a so called spook
Revelations Chapter One 13 and 16 "wool hair" "bronze skin"
Jesus was blacker than me
I'll prove and I claim that the truth has been changed
For the lies and the white supremacy to remain
That chain on your brain makes it hard to maintain
Colin Ferguson burst on them, hollow points spurting em

[Verse 3: Wise Intelligent]
Perfection, forever living, giving tongues to the dumb
G is for God, where did "gangsta" come from?
Wisdom, words and actions making knowledge for real
Witness the days when brothers have to kill or be killed
God's will will be done, the kingdom will come
Ra East the God seed, keep perfecting it, son
The Wise one ain't done
Six sextillion tons Earth
I levitate, hold the universe in place, wait
I hear debate, come look God in the face
Place your empty thoughts with the limited ways
Erase your earthly ass at the speed of 1-1-2-0
Feet per second but still you act slow
There go some Negro, confiscating my flow, ditto
This information take it home and make a plus lesson

[Hook: Wise Intellgient]

[DJ Father Shah scratches][Wise Intelligent]
I met the strangest chick, imported from Bangladesh
So what's your angle miss?
Weak wicked and dangerous?
She spoke the languages, English and Arabic
Told me very quick, she won't be sucking any dick
Say Wise Intelligent, you're unlike most other men
A lot of brothers been filling me up with compliments
So where your body's been
That's all we need to know love
Can turn this raven to a dove
Or are you just gon' try to rise above
Her kiss bionic, stimulating like a roots tonic
Let's be platonic sister I ain't even hearing it
You got me fearing that love's among the actual facts
I gots to come correct, all wise right and exact
I want you mentally and physically reflecting me
You wants my agony penetrating sexually
You won't commit but you persist with this sex shit
I won't submit cause I'm Allah and God is dominant
The sex is good but I don't need another lover sis
I'm on this trip in pursuit of Miss Intelligent
Not my type but I felt like I could change a bit
Strange, I had this thing for Miss Bangladesh
Was it the way she used to feed me fruit and rock me well?
Her wet body and punanny drip the sweetest smell
Ain't hard to tell she was the bomb like Nas and Akinyele
Skin black, poom fat, sexy as hell

[Chorus]
I can't hate you, though I have tried
Ahhhh, ahhh, ahhh
I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride

[Wise Intelligent]
Africa, ain't quite over her
Scoping her, my style with Ethiopia
Direct descendant from the Queen of Sheba, Makeba
And King Solomon, Fela'sha in origin
The sweetest lips that my tongue ever taste
Cute face the softest thing my arms ever embraced
Displaced for centuries form the rest of her race
Erased from history, see we had that much in common
We used to kick it on the dock by the Red Sea
Or on the Nile in a boat made of papyrus leaves
She told the tales of the perfect love and I was it
I tell the tales of how I fell for Miss Bangladesh
Pure finesse, the moon reflected silhouette
As I caress the nipples of her naked breast
Chest to chest, one, flesh of my flesh
Bone of my bone Africa had it going on
She spoke "shalom", peace in Hebrew style
Her voice melodic and exotic like the Virgin Isles
No Madagascar, or how I was tempted to ask her
To be my wife but my conscience wouldn't let me trap her
I felt like I was being selfish to perceiver the thought
And having sharks crowning me the thief of hearts
This sister had the kind of beauty Wise Intelligent
Thinks every brother on the planet should experience

[Chorus]
I can't hate you baby, though I have tried
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhh
I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride

[Wise Intelligent]
I stopped off to reminisce, it's a natural bliss
But yo, I fully miss her, sort of like this other sister
Me and her walked the sands of India
Me and India, took showers and plenty of
Baths together, made love in the rainy weather
Yet even better, I shared many orgasms with her
She took me home, disconnected the phone
Played the jazz of Billie Holiday and Nina Simone
She said a man is not a man if he's no worker man
Some old Patra shit, but I admit I was loving it
She said I did it for the love of the shit
So get it up hold it down like a son of bitch boy
It brings me joy making me make noise
But don't you know my roommate's trying to sleep next door
I said sure, let's swing up out of this piece
We swung the next episode, back seat of my jeep
Peep how we did creep, iller sex no sleep
She blamed it on me because she ain't no freak
Sing joy to the world the lord is come, let Earth receive her king
But how you mean, crack a tin relax and I'll explain
She called me names of ancient kings I called her queen
I was her first, she called me God I called her Earth
We just conversed on the first full moon of May
And Miss Bombay India still ain't over me

[Chorus]Did y'all know
That in the event of a national emergency or crisis in this country
The office of emergency planning can put into effect executive orders
That will suspend your constitutional bill of rights and take freedom from your ass with the signing of a piece of paper
Executive orders like, order n° 10995, which provide the government takeover of all communications and media, so R'N'B, Hip Hop, Jazz, Rock and Pop. GONE
Order n°10998, the takeover of all food resources and farms, so, buds ????. GONE
10999 provide for the takeover of all modes of transportation and control of all major highways
So your Lex, Coupes, Beamers and Benz. GONE
Order n° 11000 provides for the mobilization of all civilians into work brigades under government supervision. Hello slavery
11001, the takeover of all health, education and welfare functions
11002 designate postmaster general to operating national registration of all persons in the country, read revelations chapter 13
11003, provides for the takeover of all airports and aircrafts, see, the FAA is trying to do that shit right now!
11004, provides for housing and finance authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned as unsafe and establish new locations for populations
The same shit that just happened with Miller Homes in Trenton, New Jersey, and this happening to Cabrini-Green and other projects in Chicago
See, in the event of any national crisis in this country, these executive orders can be put into effect, let's say:
If the World Trade Center is bombed or a federal building in Oklahoma City, a plane blowing up over Long Island, a pipe bomb at the Olympics
These serve to create the panic that is necessary to issue executive order n° 11051
Which simultaneously put all other orders into effect and niggas are slaves all over again...[Wise Intelligent]
God still shall commence
To show and prove, thy third eye power of Wise, Intelligence
Wise, G's-comin-again-again-and-again
Watch the move, ghetto move
Ruffly rough, smoothly smove
Yet some do wanna know why we state the lyrics that are... fresh
What's the time, black man's time
There's no need axe me that
Why I'm an original teacher just for being that of black
Follow me now see... see I be puttin
Those that ain't in place and placin that be good and plenty
See God be on that road that leads to mastering one-twenty
From who's the original man to how far's Pluto from the sun
Uphold the weight of earth and that's, six sextillion tons
These devils lying to blacks so through the teacher truth will come
The black man's God, what's grafted is devil
And Jesus not Christian
The sun the seven the moon the star there's sixteen shades to black
The proper education, ay, consider me exact
You lack you lose you lose you lost the knowledge of yourself
And if you don't know who you are, you won't know no-one else
I'm comin' again, Wise G's comin-again-again-and-again
Ahh, ease up ahh yes selah!

Walk around in the record industry
I'm looking at all the Pharasees
Asking me where I'm going
All I know is one day that Babylon will be fallen
They welcome me into Jerusalem
Eighty niggas highly crucial by Ham
I got my .45 by my side
Just in case another nigga tests me someone's gonna die

[Wyclef Jean]
Bo bo so bo I leave the boat for the pope
Smoke mad weed but not touch pelico
Primary purpose of the set
Is to present techniques and guided practice
And forced access to forfeit
Emcees lose focus
Wyclef to accomplish throwing crumbs in the hell pit
Vocabulary, comprehension, steady reading and critical analyzing
Techniques to enable DJ's to interact with my material
Play it on your turntable scratch it if you're able
Characteristics, circumstances
Will determine how long you live Mr. actor, Mrs. actress

[Pras]
I act will snatch gats from kids with backpacks who lack raps
In an Ac to get with that

WI: Easy!

Black people say I represent when I get my chance
But when I'm rippin' to this beat, yo it's my nubian dance
That I be doing
Around these suckers' titles that I ruin
Although you do not like the flow you should not have been booing
Now you and your crew had better get your act together
Before I have to cut the Fu release the stormy weather
Whatever you say, but nigga pop your shit my way
And you'll be screaming "Mercy me" like if your name was Marvin Gaye
Now put it away and stay the fuck up out my face
I smack you in the mouth homeboy and you'll be missing taste
What a waste to everything existing up till now
So many claiming butter but just don't be knowing how


WI: So my selector, come with the rhythm!

[Pras]
For sure I'm law to be the poor righteous conscious
You might just feel thrust when I touch like Midas
My toungue is gigantic, lyrics are tremendous
Wyclef and Pras they drop hits wherever they goes like Gladys
Catch the midnight train to Georgia
As my tongue does a dropkick like Sgt. Slaughter
New world order, you lions who are trying to roar
I'll silence you lambs like Jodie Foster
There's no need to feel sentimental
Parental guidance is advised for those who despise
The Wise and Intelligent, Refugees, immigrants


WI: My selector, Culture Freedom lay the wickedest basslines

[Wise Intelligent]
May...I... kick a little something for the G-O-D's in the J-E-R-S-E-Y
Because you niggas know me I'm the da gan ya dee
Sixteen five four three five coincide freak wise
Time you recognize who run up in the nine
Rush like water raw cuts in your guts
Trails from Rozelle oh hell we rock bells
Live as Stuyvesant, Wise and them, rise again
The Gods A.V.G. they'll bomb Washin-
No man 'em trouble they jet something
Don't make me have to kick you on your God damned chin
I'll frappe you in your head with bottle of Heinekein

OK, ha -My intellect will protect what you threaten
Captain to Lieutenant, even take cadets in
I take them all rich and to the powerful
Don't fear no other force I be defining your hardcore
The folklore you spread down over tracks
Got you gassed off some shit may I suggest Ex-Lax
Relax! Your whole perception seems to be distorted
In my dimensions fake refugees get deported
Jokers be biting each other's styles so much it's eerie
So many deja vu's but can't no other crews come near me
It's weary, my brothers couldn't hold this if they grasped it
Confession to Jesus are even tried to master
I passed it off the levels of your mere mathematics
I'm on some astrophysics Quantum Leaping on your tactics
Triple bypasses, your crew's slow as molasses
While I amass cream like Jackie Kennedy Onassis

Ah ah ah ah
Refugee P.R.T. connect
New Jersey, this is how we do it

The righteous would never live and the righteous would never die

{Culture Freedom}
BUTT-NAKED-BOOTY BLESS

Verse three
{Wise Intelligent}
There's so many styles that the Wise must teach
Check the speach
As I drop to the level of your brain
Teachin' you the knowledge of yourself
Black you're God
Now some may look at me and state that I'm insane
Get wise If God's your creator
Tell me this, Tell me this
If he's your father by the mental eye sight
And like father like son it begun
So this should make the blackman God by birthright
Teaching is the duty of a civilized man
Teach truth to the youth
That be thirstin' for the knowledge
Take that head off the snake that mistake
The Wise for the brother he could wax or either polish
Teachin' what was taught to the king that sings
Droppin' mathematics as the Wise comes through
Represented by the Sun, Seven, Moon and Star
And this is a taste of the PRT crew
Gods get applause from the things we protest
Ya sexin' this style when this style is undressed
Culture one time for the mind
Drop the cause
This is the what?!
{Culture Freedom}
BUTT-NAKED-BOOTY BLESS

Verse four
{Wise Intelligent}
Stand back I attack
That weak new jack
That lacks must I mentally beat him
Poor Righteous Teachers teach to the weak
So I takes his weak, wack crew and teach them
Butt-naked booty style make it wild says the crowd
So drop Hip-Hop by the ounces
So loud as I teach this crowd, as I teach ya
And control that body as it bounces
Let me think should I stay meditate
Sink most deep into the crescent of your soul
Assume to accomplish techiques speak
This is from the Father who promise gold
Shakiyla my queen is my queen
This means this queen
Submitting to the G-O-D
One G said "God not a mystery, God but Allah"
And Allah says "God be'es me"
Gods get applause from the things we protest
Ya sexin' this style when this style is undressed
Culture one time for the mind
Drop the cause
This is the what?!
{Culture Freedom}
BUTT-NAKED-BOOTY BLESS
Yo I would like to say "Whats up and give a special shout out to my homeboy Supreme

[Culture] Yo, what's goin on Q man? Yo… Yeah, shut that door man, yo

[Wise] Ayo Culture Freedom! It's about time you showed some loyalty to this too!
[Culture] Word up! I'm goin' do that!

[Tony D] Yo well check this out, yo yo.. Take some of that echo out and I'm gonna kick it like this

[Verse 1 - Tony D]
Yo Harvee! [Who?] Harvee Wallbangar!
Met [Who? Who?] Mrs Coathanger
In the compartment of their apartment
Down with the upside down closet department
So you figure it
But please don't be a bigot
Make like a wino, and swig it
Down your mouth your throat, your esophagus
I'm too smooth - so get offa this
Sucka. You can't withstand the momentum
Take em one a day, and a Centrum vitamin. Mr Weasel
My mike's like a painting, mike stand's an easel
You go Rambo, I go Predator
Competitor, editor, creditor, and much better than a
Quacker. Rapper. Who thinks he's like Dapper
Dan like a seal I keep em clapping his hands
Balancing, a ball on his nose
And goin' "Ert ert ert!" and striking a pose
For the camera. But you say "How?"
I say are you an Indian? "Who?" - now you're an owl
Hooting. Like a bird always tooting
Polluting, the atmosphere continually tooting and hooting and looting
Meanwhile I go freestyle
Hear the funky rap with PRT on Profile
I'm running out of breath, it's time for Tone to pass it
Huh-hua! Yo Wise, please gas it

[Verse 2 - Wise Intelligent]
Once again, yes my friend, [???] tends to build up my empire
Poor Righteous Teachers, teachers
Dem said Poor Righteous Triers
Yeah now that we succeeding they must seat that weak suggestion
Cause now they even students to the Teachers and the lesson
No guessing, oh how I love to bomb a weak hypothesis
Listen cause I'm dropping this
P-R-T posse rocking this
Smooth with the roughness, this sexy style, yet
How can I sink into the crescent of the soul? check
Stummer's comin' [nope no sex?], step the rhythm
There goes P-R-T posse gone, cannot keep up with 'em
They rocked and they rolled
Rolled meaning stepped
Back upon divine land that's the projects that they rep
Sometimes the teachers teachers show then tell the tribe a-yo let's go
Pack up the equipment get me back into the ghetto

[Wise] Yo um, Culture Freedom, I think it's about that time you showed and proved to yourself - do that!
[Culture Freedom] I'm gonna do a little somethin like this --

[Verse 3 - Culture Freedom]
Here's an inorganic, bomb but don't panic
I'm the sole controller, revolving nine planets
Yes, I'm manifesting, a blessing from the heavens
Peace, to all the queens, submitting to the seven
I'm the asiatic, based on mathematic
You're the jive junkie, sack crack fanatic
Write a knowledge knowledge, wisdom be purified
My wisdom will receive, reflect and amplify
[Banish?] understanding that makes it understood, yo
I'm Culture Freedom - now ain't that good?
I use the power of refinement to serve the justice
I dare you snakes, to ever try to touch this
I deal equal, that's equality
Freezing your domes, giving no apology
Seven and a half, you know that's God
Tell em, truth is food, word is bond
I build and destroy as the earth keeps proving
Surrounded by filth but protected with clothing
Shelter's where I store my knowledge to born
Love is in the cipher, so I go on
Peace!
It's for the cause that I'm rappin' this
Love brings peace, and peace brings happiness
Total satisfaction, from one's own actions
If not? Then there's a fatal reaction
You call it static in the attic the static will be dynamic
You say you're satisfied? Well I'm flattered
At the end of this verse, you know who rules
I have my mathematics divine with twelve jewels
And there [??? drop down?] the brothers and the others that lack
Yo um, here comes the beat, but I'll be back

[Wise] Word!

[Outro]
[Culture] Crash-mashin the set, you know what I'm sayin? CF is in full effect; Poor Righteous Teachers, Tony D, and the PRT Posse, gettin' stupid, dumb, retarded, and all that, you know what I'm sayin?
[IQ] IQ, North Side Productions

[Wise] By the way, sayin' peace to all the gods of the universe

[Culture] And my boy Shaheed, know what I'm sayin, rockin that funky new radical hip hop scratchin that no one else can be catchin cuts; I'd like to say peace you know what I'm sayin? And we in this
[Wise] That was a positive universal greeting! We in this!

(It's nothing but conscious style) (x3)

[Wise Intelligent]
Yo, where the teachers went, with all that pro-black shit?
Where all the conscious niggas, who used to chat like this?
See, I remember yesterday when y'all was Gods and Earths
Egyptians and metaphysicists on the verge of giving birth
To understanding, and planting seeds that grow
Now everybody's on that bullshit about killing and so
Eat my pussy, suck my dick, well that's the size of the shit
So in the head of ignorance, I rip some conscious clip
Niggas is small, my task is educate y'all
Can you stop selling crack cause negro that takes balls
I'm on that road called freedom, seldom traveled by the multitude
I bring gifts of life, light, and some conscious food
God degree, cause see God's the size of me
And yeah, what's the difference with the west and the east
I feel there ain't no difference, so spread the news I spit
And since I got you listening, I guess I'll prove the shit
There's niggas is lacking over there, niggas is lacking over here
Some niggas is dying over here, and niggas is dying over there
Black youth don't follow them, because they don't know shit
They selling you death on that pursuit for Benz and Lexus
We gots to talk about, cause I'll reveal your ass
You can't shield your dirty thoughts with no five percent fact
Peep the jewels that I craft, see the fools that I class
I be schooling your ass, cause being truth is a task
And I am nothing but, I'm God-blessed nigga, what?
Take your hands off your nuts, and your lips off that blunt
Stand for something, stand erect, stand for this
You'll fall for anything cause you don't stand for shit
I murder slime, come wicked every time
And fill your mind with conscious rhyme

(It's nothing but conscious style)

[KRS-One]
You ever wonder why you ain't living how you should be living
Could it be your mentality you're giving off?
North, south, west, east, like an unchained beast
Your thoughts bringing you to deceased
I'll release a little piece with speed
Before the savage emcee proceeds to feed
Upon the minds of the minor, I find the antidote
To the empty emcee that thinks they dope
We ain't got too far to go
Opportunities are shutting down faster than this rhyme flow
One day you're in your sauna, next day a goner
You can sit and play games like Bugs Bunny if you wanna
Real bad boys used to move in silence, peep it
But now real bad boys seem to move in secret societies, a trip
Don't slip with your lip talking shit with your clip
Showing your ass as I blast into it
With a clip of conscious lyrical wit
KRS-One comes well equipped
You can follow me in a mass of one follow me in a mass of two turntables
You're listening to the sound now of the Profile label
With B.D.P.R.T
Yo Wise, tell 'em just what you see

[Wise Intelligent]
Niggas is talented, but they let it go to waste
I'm came to smack that ign'ant smile off your face
You're lacking knowledge of self and what I'm talking about
You niggas laughing but that's something you should cry out
Right now you're finding out is God is back up in the house
My weapon's in my mouth and watch how I can take you out
Intelligent, represent
Ignorance, slaughter it
Slangspit Entertainment
Run shit, on the planet
B.D.P., up on the mix
P.R.T., conscious lyrics
You're suffering
Niggas is sick, where's the Bufferin?
I hear that gangsta shit but let some conscious brothers hit
You know the type that fight, live and die for truthful rights
Not only that, we will kill for this righteous life
I'm on the mic for the purpose of shedding light
You take my life? Go fly a fucking kite
I'm infinite, I'm yesterday, today, tonight
Tomorrow morning, you see this is your future talking
Babylon is fallen, poor people of the world are ballin'
Black people calling for P.R.T. and what we talkin'
Black facts and shit like that
Dress and lack, get your head cracked
Rip tracks and refuse to come whack
(Yo P.R.T. them niggas' lyrics, you notice that?)
I learned this line, come wicked every time
And fill your mind with a conscious rhyme

KRS: Yeah, check it out one check it out
(It's nothing but conscious style)
WI: Roll up your arms if you love the new fisherman style, hear me now
(It's nothing but conscious style)
KRS: B.D.P. coming through

KRS: Knowledge reigns supreme
(It's nothing but conscious style)[Wise Intelligent]

Standing here thinking why standing here thinking why (x6)

Babylon take me away, why
Down to Rikers Island donde
This is what I see every day, oh yeah
Use razor cutters to cut matches in four
Cause I not sure to get no more
No no more
No no more

[Wise Intelligent]
Witness the days and be real
The days of boys and rappers
Soul snatchers, gun clappers, and bloodsucking crackers
The body catchers who keep their weapons pointed at ya
The life subtracters, the poison animal eating slackers
Nobody move, nobody bleed as I proceed
I beg you heed this thing me talk with Junior Reid
You load your clip, you cock your shit get on your way
You're guaranteed to murder something today
From Rikers Island to Sing Sing and San Quentin
You're touring prisons, result of all that bullshitting
But now you're bitching, better sharpen up that ice pick and
Proceed to stick him or kiss your stupid ass good riddance

[Junior Reid]

Take me from my wonderful home, oh
Carry me to here in Rome, no
Someone's smart will use one comb
Mine'll make a knife
About to get fleas and lice
Tonight
The man who smoke and bruise lose
They'll always have a next men to use
Peep the gangsta man, why-oy
Of this operation, why-oy
Brutalization, why-oy
Love to the nation, why-oy

[Wise Intelligent]

True
That day they took me away they had me bound in shackles
Locked down tweleve brothers connected by the ankles
By chains we dangled imprisoned for the star spangled
Banner for glamour mad motherfucker's slammer
Just like the streets there's niggas in here wildin' out and dying
You can receive any drugs that you want to try and
The only difference between the streets and prison living
Are homosexuals, the closest you can get to women
And I ain't 'bout to demote the self and go that route
I've been here two years, one week and I want out
When will it cease, this way of death ain't fit for beasts
I fail to see a correctional facility

[Junior Reid]

It was a dreadful day
Eradication take me away
Take me to a penitentiary
This is what I see every day, oh yeah
Use razor cutters to cut matches in four
Cause me not sure to get no more
No no more why-oy
No no more yeah
Ten men smoke once leave dayy
Don't mean we on stage eight
Look me eye no red
Like wild monkey weed I'm dead, dead
Poor Righetous Teacher
And Junior Reid sensei
We wanna see the sun rise
In the land of the rising sun

It was a dreadful day
Babylon take me away
Down to Rikers Island donde
This is what I see every day, oh yeah
This is what I see every day
This is what I see every day

Life in a jailhouse, life so rough
Life in a jailhouse so tough
So roughRoots!

Praise for the days when I couldn't get paid
In the fix on the mix in the damn projects
Cracks for the blacks but I couldn't sell that
Even though blacks couldn't get jobs and shit
Hit after hit from the Sugarhill Gang
Hear a Pow Wow, hear a Big Bang Bang
It was strange, I was broke but I still got the record
Even though I was poor and about butt naked
Rats in my front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley running styles for the crack
It was ill on the real, I be still bugging off it
In the ways I will walk it so today I can talk it
It's a shame how the games in the ghetto get played
On the cracks they paid for the tricks they laid
I'm afraid for the youth in this time we're living in
Just about 13 on the scene scrambling
Gambling small-time, apologize nice
I'm about to roll 10 7's for the crap I rolled twice
Rough business, it's a rich mon time
When you ain't got the loot, you resort to the crime
From the cess house, the youth house, the jail house, the Cult house
Where I perfected these skills I be doggin
Love to teach the facts but the brothers in the back
Can't see what I'm saying cause the blunt smoke is foggin
Still I proceed with degrees of the wisdom
Cause this shit's thick, it kicks and I know it
Lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto

From ghetto to ghetto, from project to project
Bookbag of lessons but I ain't have dough yet
From knowledge to wisdom, from wisdom to see
And understand me if you don't dance, G
It's a god in the house, it's a god in the house
And I'm godding it out, and I'm godding it out
I've come a long way, the strong way, the wrong way, I lived it
The right way, you might say, I got it, I'll give it
But praise for the days when I used to be tramp
And had to freeload of my Earth's food stamps
Til I stopped, paused, start the pop's stores
It was ill on the real, but who's to die for us?
Say that I rock my own community
Ain't a damn thing owned by the you or the me
It's Koreans I be seeing on the neighborhood corners
With the guns and the stores and love the ??? owners
So beg my parton, peace Natasha Harton
See I won't forget, I know for shit's starting
From my way to LA, from JA to UK
I am who I am, I say what I say
I gots no time to love a slave trader
Cause according to the constitution, they'll always hate us
Play this, say this, and say it like I said it
Cause a magazine edit can get your ass beheaded
I'm thorough breaded, black slave dreaded
The shit that y'all doing, I already did it!
But lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto

Praise for the days when I used to be trife
With a lack of understanding anything about life
So thanks to Malcom, Martin, Wylee Ferartin
Father Allah talk the talk that I'm starting
Peace to Elijah, we can't forget about ya
Teaching us how ta, get up out the
Project complex caves
Another damn rave for the damn ex-slave
My ghetto noise ringing from a project hallway
Don't want to hear my mom say "Blacks have come a long way"
How can she see that when we haven't eaten all day
Haven't had a job since the ending of the slave trade
Then they give us church, attempt to try and ease this
But I check it out, had to learn about Jesus
Told em he was black and they called me a hater
Then he's on the church wall, yeah like a slave trader
Something real funny's going on boy I'll tell ya
Send you up sell ya, free ya try to kill ya
Martin taught me much when he simply tried to love em
Brother all about peace but the devils had to snuff him, but
Lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto
Lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto[Wise Intelligent]
Yeah, know what I'm saying?
Wise Intelligent, broadcasting live from the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro
Know what I'm saying?
Hip hop go wherever I go
For real, Poor Righteous Teachers represent
'96 off the hook we're dropping this hit kid
Watch

[Wise Intelligent]
Lord, how you be, madam G, peace God
Fuck frauds, get yours, kick ass, leave scars
On Mars I built a school to study life on Earth
Thoughts burst, a million rappers murdered in the first verse
Now what's than eating dirt, being buried alive
Put to death by surprise in the name of black gods
Ain't I most fly? Young pie don't cry
Dry the tears from your eye and your lover might live
Like to give, like to take, never making mistakes
All wise enjoying everything right and exact
Poor facts, pro-black, Donnelly Homes projects
Learn that time is the same on Casio or Rolex
Knowledge James, chapter two, verse one through six
But try not to judge a man by the price of his kicks
We'll often talk shit co-workers worse than accents
Cause you know Jersey runs things every time boy
Build destroy, Clinton must make noise
Enjoy the fruits of life, need the wife and my boys
My seed won't need for anything, trust me
Black man, 'nuff land, eight hundred acres of trees
Please the seven seas travel regularly
Degrees consciously study everywhere we be
Family daring he who talks enough shit
And come and get the stitch to fix the split of the lip
This status shit provide us
We call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers black

[Nine]
Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

[Chorus]
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er

[Wise Intelligent]
Intelligent, twenty-three, now nineteen five
Hold the mic I'll rise right in front of your eyes
In here six years see what I felt every year
Oh yeah it's ninety-six I'm born and understanding, understood
Get the goods, build a school down south
In some remote location that nobody knows about
Teach, add on to the life that we live
God degree, twelve jewels, eat the foot that I give
No pig, strictly kosher mathematics and fact
Poor blacks on track mission to take the Earth back
Cause Whitey got it locked, that's why the whole world's lost
We wearing crowns made of thorns and being put to the cross
Lost souls futures told in the Dead Sea Scrolls
God reduced to a savage lacking soul control
Talking lots of shit about his drugs and guns
Several daughters, 'nuff sons, ain't trying to raise none, yo
Whoa-ho-ho, let me slow up with the flow
Can't move too quick because niggas got to know
The duty of the civilized is to civilize the uncivilized
And make the world recognize
That God is Wise, and Wise is God to the death
And back to life, you Lazarus and I'm the Christ
The forthcoming, like a thief in the night
The wave of light, the key to everlasting life
That shit provide us, to call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all

[Nine]
Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

[Chorus] (x2)
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er

[Wise Intelligent]
Since I've been away I've been thinking about
How gunslingers turned singers and black culture went out
Wake up all you teachers tired of teaching and wait
Grass roots, pass truth into the ears of black youths
Watch me talk the talk and walk the walk right now
As mystic as it seems, I bring for real to your dream seeing
Midnight marauder got it dipped off the block drug
Street niggas bug cause they know we do it for the love
We rose above every limit that they said we had
Who loves your ass enough to strictly educate the mass?
Come get your cash, fill your mind with swine and dash
For longevity, these niggas we will never be
You will remember we from now till forever gee
I am infinity, lyrics flowing endlessly
You ain't no friend to me so don't even pretend to be
Like O.J. Simpson be sleeping with the enemy
I call you out and make the world know your ass is lacking
Quoting some lessons but see no parts of understanding
You standing under my rain, snow, sleet, hail and thunder
That's why you wonder what's causing this to exist
I raise the mist, distill the myths of many currents
Don't be determined except to life forget the death
Nevertheless you're being blessed cause I'm who God is
Don't know the time niggas must be wearing Guess watches
Hands on your boxes, turn 'em up like seven notches
Your Magnavoxes amplify my super conscious
Shit providers, we'll call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all

Learn thy Holy Intellect cuzz it's a blessing
Teachers study what is spoken through the speaker
Weaker preachers there's no need for manifestin'
I'm the star soul controlin' all within the solar
Poor... So I'm a righteous teacher from the heart
Praising god. All praises due to Allah
Seven star the holy intellect being taught
Grab a hold I'm not here to promise any gold
Lessons told the story about a trader of that type
I tell this mic that I'm not here to feed your fantasy
Cuzz that ain't right
I guarantee ya everlasting life...Mentally
The holy intellect is infinite and heaven sent
Adam walked upon the holy soil I'll destroy ya
Any man possessin six and a half will laugh at that
Then watch his brain cells boil
PRT Poor Righteous Teachers Culture Free and me
It's got to be, the holy intellectuals of the set
But don't forget, we also drop Butt Naked Booty Bless
But now we test this-holy-intellect

Chorus
[DJ Father Shaheed] scratches
Holy...holy...It's awright!!...pure...pure (3x)

[Verse 2]
When I say holy first I must be speaking upon the mental
My temple
Where might I stay within Divineland?
Gods steppin' up to me say "G ya have to understand
You got to do this like a Blackman" . Mmmm...
So I take this into consid'
Call upon the intellect to create what I did
Ghetto! Stay strictly ghetto is my motto
I got em trying to place me as a role model
Should one say role model or should the term be example?
Of a wise black leader speaker
Self will say poor righteous teacher weaker people don't always agree
Check ... What I may manifest next
Poorly Righteous Teachers droppin' Holy Intellect
Givin' you da best of what I may protest
DIVINE IS MY PROJECTS...HELL YES
Listen to the hypeness
No other style is like this
Say you could stop the righteous.?!
Well manifest punk!
Ya haven't did it yet
Ya possee oughtta step
Your mental's stimulated from this holy intellect

Chorus
[DJ Father Shaheed] scratches
Holy...holy...It's awright!!...pure...pure (3x)

[Verse 3]
[Culture Freedom]
HOLY...
[Wise Intelligent]
Anything not tampered or diluted with G
Supremely being sacred to me
[Culture Freedom]
It's gotta be
[Wise]
That wonderful posse PRT
[Culture Free]
Not smokin weed
[Wise]
Cuzz that ain't where we want to be
Intellect the wisest manifestation of a thought
PRT Poor Righteous Teachers teachin from the heart
I was lost but now I'm found and all are being taught
Calm down in other words don't let me start
Cuzz I'm the teacher teachin' those that lack what I be teachin'
??? speakin' Poor Righteous Teachers never known to weaken
I be reachin' those within the ghetto because they seekin' wiser leaders
Not poison animal eatin' creatures those with knowledge of self
'n' those with out take me out
Those negative thoughts are soon to fade away cuzz I don't play
I take the life of snake????of the day.!
Yo it remains this way
PRT Poor Righteous Teachers givin' what cha get bit for bit
Not from a six dollar ryhme kid sit
As I proceed to give you it
It's legit! from this holy intellect

Chorus
[DJ Father Shaheed] scratches
Holy...holy...It's awright!!...pure...pure (3x)

[Verse 4]
I work hard don't ever slip to fall victim
Stick them which tend not to shine
Blind anyone that laughs at my kind
Why? Because PRT is holy as the mind
Check What one must do to come next
Let's show holy intellect
Thoughts created from the crescent of the brain cell
Fell deep into this mic that I be holding
I told them PRT be's always sole controllin'
They laugh but listen to the lessons I be born I'm the teacher
Or am I one subjected to the negative, nope
It's amazing how my thoughts can be wrote to perform
[Culture Freedom]
Pardon may I ask whats going on?
[Wise Intelligent]
Word is bond the Wise is making knowledge born
Now I say yes or should one say 'Y' equals to himself Y equals self
I'm born to be the oposite ?????flow
Poor Righteous Teachers know that we be po'
We gotta go (Peace!)
But will be back though

Chorus
[DJ Father Shaheed] scratches
Holy...holy...It's awright!!...pure...pure (till end)[Culture Freedom]
Heavens to Merkatroid!! *Snagglepuss imitation*

[Wise Intelligent]
Posse, friends God, tend to the teacher
Stammered at me concept, teacher nice it up, right
PRT p-osse, boy ghetto with philosophers
All can't get enough of this, drummer common insight, check
Here comes the teacher with another funky new
Radical, butt-naked booty stinkin form of thinkin
Off an on off-step, concept, tell em Culture Freedom
Shall I sex this? (Well God it's sexy!)
This this step steppers come and steppers swingin
Most blacks back back-up what the hell we bringin
G-fine nearly singin, my rhythm hit the roof!!
This one's dedicated to the CISI missing youth, cause
This hit the teacher with another style of mashin up
A damn dance, jams get, jammed by the PRT p-osse
(and) Tone can I get a sound check, well can I start this
(Yo Wise, it's started)
You know I look into the mirror see myself and then
I always often say... "Hot damn I'm great"

Chorus: repeat two lines 3X

Let's be realistic... (you are the best) [ahh yeah] hot damn I'm great

See me forgetting on the top of every set
Of about a million and one of my songs, my favorite's Holy Intellect
Check Wise on the rise I emerge from slum
Come one come all see, the teacher heal the dumb
Cause, this hit the teacher givin birth to a ghetto style
Display, most poor people of the planet
Can relate to, poverty in a song
Conquered and divided, tricked and undecided
Black people in oppresion, so the oppressed tell about it
So I often give ya what I think ya need to know
Understanding jamming mind and Culture Freedom tell ya so
No black no white, cause black be's first
Son of man, take a stand, for black children of the earth
Just, just check out teacher and the way that I evolved
Since last time, I'm truely perfection
But, don't balance this with the other LP
For the last rhymes, cause there's no connection
If I was the DJ Father Shaheed come and tell em what I'd say...
"Hot damn I'm great"

Chorus: repeat two lines 4X

See draw the clearer picture of the teacher teachin this
It's, sort of smooth, roughness
Plus this flow go more miles back
God's gotta be that of a leader in this thing called rap
Cause, this hit the teacher on the roads often travelled
By the multitude, Culture Freedom knows it best
Some of them got a problem with the Gods in the house
Cause we don't sleep, traitor interpretate this
Allah equal God equal He with supreme qualities
You best believe God's real and
If it's God Sha, it's gotta be
("Tribe... called... P... R... T-T...")
Culture Free, Father Sha, and me, cause
This hit the teacher on a whole nother level
With a clear scope, and range on things hang
Out by the speaker if you're weak or come and eat
From the strong song, that's if you are what you eat
Never will I feed ya that of poison and disguise it
With a beat, the tree of life be's me
Sweet chariot, come fi carry me home, and I pray...
"Hot damn I'm great"

*interpretations of chorus to end*[Wise Intelligent]
God still shall commence
To show and prove, thy third eye power of Wise, Intelligence
Wise, G's-comin-again-again-and-again
Watch the move, ghetto move
Ruffly rough, smoothly smove
Yet some do wanna know why we state the lyrics that are... fresh
What's the time, black man's time
There's no need axe me that
Why I'm an original teacher just for being that of black
Follow me now see... see I be puttin
Those that ain't in place and placin that be good and plenty
See God be on that road that leads to mastering one-twenty
From who's the original man to how far's Pluto from the sun
Uphold the weight of earth and that's, six sextillion tons
These devils lying to blacks so through the teacher truth will come
The black man's God, what's grafted is devil
And Jesus not Christian
The sun the seven the moon the star there's sixteen shades to black
The proper education, ay, consider me exact
You lack you lose you lose you lost the knowledge of yourself
And if you don't know who you are, you won't know no-one else
I'm comin' again, Wise G's comin-again-again-and-again
Ahh, ease up ahh yes selah!
*laughter*
Stop that[Wise Intelligent]
Yo for truly, we representing for the love of this (this is a love story)
Yeah, This one is dedicated to all my niggas in central New Jerusalem
All the brothers who picked up that ring after I put it down
And took Miss Ghetto to be their unlawfully wedded wives
Poor Righteous Teachers representing the nine

It's like that and you don't stop
She's like cocaine, running around my brain
Miss Ghetto be like cocaine, running around your brain

[Wise Intelligent]
I know some crack slangers, gangbangers and cracker shankers
They soldier-trainers, teaching their kids to murder strangers
They live for danger, they express the "I ain't Nigga"
Miss Ghetto got 'em dreaming of loot and Swiss bankers
The finest weapons, packing tri-action Smith and Wesson's
Unlike the 80's, ladies packing secret 380's
The shit is crazy, but it's life to ghetto babies
They gotta eat, so the streets provide the gravy
I thought I maybe, could show 'em the other way G
Of Gods and Earths, resurrected through mental birth
From death to life, teaching niggas of every type
The wrongs and rights, to put an end to living trife
The black man is God, the 12th jewel is thirteen
The pursuit of it can make savages out of kings
Cause blush, to live with these niggas is in a rush
In God they trust, so they sell crack to us
Lust for what whitey got and whitey has
Can see your ass on pursuit to get cash
To look thrash, to driving the latest jags
To rock rags made by Italian fags
See, I never meant to fall in love with this shit
But Miss Ghetto you's a slut so I'm divorcing you bitch
Bust it

Chorus:
I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing (x2)

She's like cocaine running around my brain
(No matter how much loot I get I'm staying in the projects) (x2)

Down in my gutter
Just like others there's teenage mothers
There's dying brothers, shooting out with one another
They wanted badly, for sisters to call them Daddy
To drive a Caddy, stories unheard by Dear Abby
They're dressing flashy
Can't be caught in fatigue khakis
They're rocking coogi, versace and cold boots G
These brothers do it for the love of the life
But I refuse to fall twice and take Miss Ghetto to wife
I used to sex her, bust my nut, get my cash real fast
But that was all that she produced, I felt my life wouldn't last
We used to go to New York, traffic guns of all sort
When killing became sport street life became short
I thought, "Are we junkies like these baseheads, Yo
They addicted to the crack while we addicted to dough"
For truly, I never meant to fall in love with this shit
But Miss Ghetto you's a slut so I'm divorcing you bitch
Bust it

Chorus:
I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing (x2)

She's like cocaine running around my brain
(No matter how much loot I get I'm staying in the projects) (x2)

See, there go some niggas that I used to roll with
Still on that crack and gun shit
Endless pursuit to run shit, bust it
Miss Ghetto got 'em strung out on the putang cream
That does up Wu-Tang fiends
For slingin cocaine, dig it
We used to do the bumper crack for the sex
While making love to the checks, Miss Ghetto's steelo complex
Living trifling, no matter where my life went
Miss Ghetto, my new wife, went she made it more exciting
Fighting, shooting out, doing all type dirt
Being these, seeing G's putting in much work
Word, we used to keep a sisters underwear laced
With ganja and freebase and bo juice to parlay
Flip! Me and my niggas ran the strip pushing dip
Black cats and plastics, fucking the minds of black kids
Till one day, I was confronted by this wise old chap
He said, "I know you sell crack, but what, you out to kill blacks?"
I wasn't trying to hear it, my excuse sorta weak
I said that we gotta eat, that's why we running these streets
Then he said, "Don't you know that whitey give you that coke
That bullshit pursuit of plush that got you killing your folk?"
Life, I didn't understand that shit back then
But now I do so I refuse to roll with whitey again
Bust it
I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing, niggas

I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing, niggas

Chorus x2:
I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing (x2)

She's like cocaine running around my brain
(No matter how much loot I get I'm staying in the projects) (x2)

See Gods, you like cocaine, fucking with my brain
You like cocaine, running around my brain
For the love of this...[Wise Intelligent]
I met the strangest chick, imported from Bangladesh
So what's your angle miss?
Weak wicked and dangerous?
She spoke the languages, English and Arabic
Told me very quick, she won't be sucking any dick
Say Wise Intelligent, you're unlike most other men
A lot of brothers been filling me up with compliments
So where your body's been
That's all we need to know love
Can turn this raven to a dove
Or are you just gon' try to rise above
Her kiss bionic, stimulating like a roots tonic
Let's be platonic sister I ain't even hearing it
You got me fearing that love's among the actual facts
I gots to come correct, all wise right and exact
I want you mentally and physically reflecting me
You wants my agony penetrating sexually
You won't commit but you persist with this sex shit
I won't submit cause I'm Allah and God is dominant
The sex is good but I don't need another lover sis
I'm on this trip in pursuit of Miss Intelligent
Not my type but I felt like I could change a bit
Strange, I had this thing for Miss Bangladesh
Was it the way she used to feed me fruit and rock me well?
Her wet body and punanny drip the sweetest smell
Ain't hard to tell she was the bomb like Nas and Akinyele
Skin black, poom fat, sexy as hell

[Chorus]
I can't hate you, though I have tried
Ahhhh, ahhh, ahhh
I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride

[Wise Intelligent]
Africa, ain't quite over her
Scoping her, my style with Ethiopia
Direct descendant from the Queen of Sheba, Makeba
And King Solomon, Fela'sha in origin
The sweetest lips that my tongue ever taste
Cute face the softest thing my arms ever embraced
Displaced for centuries form the rest of her race
Erased from history, see we had that much in common
We used to kick it on the dock by the Red Sea
Or on the Nile in a boat made of papyrus leaves
She told the tales of the perfect love and I was it
I tell the tales of how I fell for Miss Bangladesh
Pure finesse, the moon reflected silhouette
As I caress the nipples of her naked breast
Chest to chest, one, flesh of my flesh
Bone of my bone Africa had it going on
She spoke "shalom", peace in Hebrew style
Her voice melodic and exotic like the Virgin Isles
No Madagascar, or how I was tempted to ask her
To be my wife but my conscience wouldn't let me trap her
I felt like I was being selfish to perceiver the thought
And having sharks crowning me the thief of hearts
This sister had the kind of beauty Wise Intelligent
Thinks every brother on the planet should experience

[Chorus]
I can't hate you baby, though I have tried
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhh
I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride

[Wise Intelligent]
I stopped off to reminisce, it's a natural bliss
But yo, I fully miss her, sort of like this other sister
Me and her walked the sands of India
Me and India, took showers and plenty of
Baths together, made love in the rainy weather
Yet even better, I shared many orgasms with her
She took me home, disconnected the phone
Played the jazz of Billie Holiday and Nina Simone
She said a man is not a man if he's no worker man
Some old Patra shit, but I admit I was loving it
She said I did it for the love of the shit
So get it up hold it down like a son of bitch boy
It brings me joy making me make noise
But don't you know my roommate's trying to sleep next door
I said sure, let's swing up out of this piece
We swung the next episode, back seat of my jeep
Peep how we did creep, iller sex no sleep
She blamed it on me because she ain't no freak
Sing joy to the world the lord is come, let Earth receive her king
But how you mean, crack a tin relax and I'll explain
She called me names of ancient kings I called her queen
I was her first, she called me God I called her Earth
We just conversed on the first full moon of May
And Miss Bombay India still ain't over me

[Chorus]Did y'all know
That in the event of a national emergency or crisis in this country
The office of emergency planning can put into effect executive orders
That will suspend your constitutional bill of rights and take freedom from your ass with the signing of a piece of paper
Executive orders like, order n° 10995, which provide the government takeover of all communications and media, so R'N'B, Hip Hop, Jazz, Rock and Pop. GONE
Order n°10998, the takeover of all food resources and farms, so, buds ????. GONE
10999 provide for the takeover of all modes of transportation and control of all major highways
So your Lex, Coupes, Beamers and Benz. GONE
Order n° 11000 provides for the mobilization of all civilians into work brigades under government supervision. Hello slavery
11001, the takeover of all health, education and welfare functions
11002 designate postmaster general to operating national registration of all persons in the country, read revelations chapter 13
11003, provides for the takeover of all airports and aircrafts, see, the FAA is trying to do that shit right now!
11004, provides for housing and finance authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned as unsafe and establish new locations for populations
The same shit that just happened with Miller Homes in Trenton, New Jersey, and this happening to Cabrini-Green and other projects in Chicago
See, in the event of any national crisis in this country, these executive orders can be put into effect, let's say:
If the World Trade Center is bombed or a federal building in Oklahoma City, a plane blowing up over Long Island, a pipe bomb at the Olympics
These serve to create the panic that is necessary to issue executive order n° 11051
Which simultaneously put all other orders into effect and niggas are slaves all over again...Verse 1
[Wise]
So many teachers, yet so little mental being seen
Everybody's ruling, yet nobody's being king
[Culture Freedom]
Word iz life 'G'
[Wise]
But Culture Free how could this be?
Our people need some leaders and some positivity
[Culture Freedom]
Like Farrakhan 'G'
[Wise]
Or like that brother Malcolm X
Who turned the hands of time when given knowledge of himself
[Culture Freedom & Wise]
It's sorta simple see
[Wise]
The Father Shah bombs the techniques
Weak?... nobody in my posse
[Culture Freedom]
Teacher, teacher! Please teach the untaught thought
[Wise]
Strictly I be ghetto so you know it's from the heart
Scream for peace, for peace which rightfully be mine
Disagree?
Then let the teacher take ya back in time
Once upon a time upon the earth
Many say we're cursed
But those who are black are that of first
Ever to exist upon the planet
Let me speak more candid
I'm here to give a greater understanding
Peace was the flow of the universe
So shut your bible
Stop tellin' lies that you were first
[Culture Freedom]
T'cha, T'cha! What about the students lackin' lessons?
[Wise]
There's also many teachers, yet a lack of manifestin'
Teachers oughtta teach if they be teachers
Educate the weaker
Poor Righteous Teachers teachin' cause I feel
So many teachers grab the mic and just be talkin'
So many lackin' cuz these teachers oughtta build

[Instrumental break]

Verse 2
[Wise]
I am a teacher
Some what symbolic to a king
Still some disagree when I state this
I wear a crown
Which represents the knowledge of the teacher
Weaker - speak the snake which try to take this
Wisdom - wise words being spoken
The purified ways in which I manifest
I'm never sested
Because the knowledge stimulates me
And brain cells are too great for havin' this
[Culture Freedom]
Well come again 'G'
[Wise]
Within an automatic second
I manifest thoughts that I accumulate
[Culture Freedom]
To demonstrate 'G'
[Wise]
Mainfestate - weight of the insight
[Culture Freedom]
Light?
[Wise]
Right!... Some positivity
Why can't we
The black communities
Come together to conquer the opponent
Cause if we show just a small sense of unity
Everything the eye see before me
We'd own it
Truth be the wise words spoken
The I swings the sword
The Lord of all worlds being born
Word bond to the lost and the found
I down any clown
And on my crown that is sworn
Yes, the set consist of many teachers
Time for I to question what these teachers say they're teachin'
Who am I to question what another man is stating?
[Culture Freedom]
To who are you relating?
[Wise]
To you if you know not of what you're speaking

[Instrumental break]

Verse 3
[Wise Intelligent]
So many teachers they taught me
I say they taught me well
They taught me to be self wise of one self
To study what they teach me
No one could teach me how to
So you know I'm not takin' anything on face value
[Culture Freedom]
Observation
[Wise Intelligent]
Mandatory... Whenever present
To study what is spoken by teacher manifesting
[Culture Freedom]
Perception
[Wise Intelligent]
I'd say, perceiving of a thought
Conceiving be delivering the weight of what was taught
It's sorta simple, some would say and somewhat complicated
But life is often balanced by the way in which you take it
Me fake it?
Never 'G', The truth reveals itself
My understanding's understood
And mine will come from no one else
Make knowledge born the duty of the civilized
'G' not satisfied until the dark race rise
[Culture Freedom]
Peace Wise
[Wise Intelligent]
Peace, but I'm not signing off yet
These teachers don't be building so it's time to manifest

[Instrumental break][intro]
Yo um, this one's dedicated to the one them call Culture Freedom… yeah

[Verse 1]
So many have waited
For someone such as myself to go solo
Oh no, oh hell, black prevails, brain cells
[To ???] a positive thought to help create this, greatness
Your posse tried it but they failed and my p-osse
PRT posse founded by some teachers
A couple of microphones then turned tables into speakers
Wisest manifestations of the words I manifest
Support from all the Gods up in Divineland Projects
Yo its a black thing
And other than down won't understand
And when I'm speaking upon a God I must be speaking upon a blackman

[Hook]
You, black man! Tell the real story (x4)

[Verse 2]
So I proceed
To teach you from three hundred and sixty degrees of what you're lackin -
The fabrics, core knowledge of yourself
Many felt, the coming of the lord and the lord came himself
Couldn't send nobody else
Black people, stop and take a look at where you're at -
Projects, modern-day cage for the blacks
Wake up - from these animalistic problems
Give them back their Bible, cause it's unable to solve them
We must come together as a people
Teach each as an equal
About the right way to go
Yo, take off your cross black, because it's crossin up your mental
You fail to comprehend the flow and I'm kickin it to ya -
Kickin it to ya straight from Divine Land
Speaking upon a god, so I must be speaking upon a Blackman

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This is ghetto, 100% rough like a hallway
Up in D-Land Projects where the PRT p-osse stay
Why must we try to be materially financed?
I'm not sellin drugs, I'm for the people of Divine Land
Low income projects, that is
Poor Righteous Teacher keeps the head above negative
Well, very true - but what must one do to get it through to you?
Speak when spoken to, or grab the mic and simply bomb a few, weak
Not right, lowlifes not the ghetto type
But usin' eyes for the hype
Not kickin it to ya -
Not kickin it to ya straight from Divine Land
Not speaking upon a god, not even speaking upon a blackman

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I use this fabric, this fabric called knowledge of myself
That keeps me striving - risin' to the tip-top
I often mention, or rock ya like a shocker to get attention
Gods, are ruling up in hip hop
Why stop? When I drop what I top with insight
Light for the spot, not rows to the left
Right? Right meaning black to be exact you put the needle to the wax
Come hear my actual facts
Maker the owner, creamer of the planet, my life do you have it
Many of us cram to understand and I'm kickin it to ya -
Kickin it to ya straight from Divine Land
Speaking upon a god so I must be speaking upon a Blackman

[outtro]
Like I said, strictly for the one them call Culture Freedom, cause we can do dat. We done that. We outta here[Culture Freedom] Yo, you hear about them weak kids poppin' all that bull about the PRT posse? Y'know what I'm sayin, about Northside Productions?
[Wise Intelligent] Word 'em up
[Culture Freedom] Yo, they said that we weak, y'know what I'm sayin? But they was just as broke'd out as the next man, y'know what I'm sayin? When the lunch truck came around, they was the first ones in line, snatchin' and takin' mine! Hit 'em!

Boy I'll drop - funky new radical hip hop
Watch not wait
Open up your third eye its for seeing
God, seeming to be ruling up in hip hop. Stop
No need to drop my righteous state of being I'm just another
Wise civilized black brother
Meditating, teaching what I thought should be taught
You're sellin coke - but what if there were no one there to smoke?
You'd be broke
So cease in the name of the law
Everybody, simply hiply hop as I drop it, Islamic
Each and every topic manifested
Undressed it, request it
Accept it, don't stop it
Logic, we had to let the naked booty bless it
Test it - see if it was naked enough for records
Press it - [why?] keep it away from people that would sex it
Wise - poorly righteous teachin' with the positive thought
As I drop my style, I let the lessons be taught

Wise teaching the untaught thought from the heart
But some have not caught what I'm saying -
Hip hop drops - but don't stop me - family
(Wise be ain't for no playin!)
Stone, symbolic to a hard god
Let me speak, the seven and a half must teach much peace
The voice from my brother [a man] tell you separately
See - PRT posse, smooth - like the voices that flow with the sample
I get rough when the wind like rhyme blow
Teacher - so I'm not following leaders you know? (Leaders follow the way that the Wise go!)
Yes! Why equals knowledge born
All those with it say "word is bond" (word is bond!)
I give my life if my word should fail
It's all a part of the life that I live
Nope, I'm not a snake so I don't conceal
I born the truth in the rhymes that I give
But I thought, as I drop my style I let the lessons be taught

I be droppin, quote say I'm toppin the topic Islamic
But let ask the students I teach - I'm sole controlling
All the mics I be holding
Watch mental heights that I reach I profile
Funky new radical style
I be stylin this style, flauntin my new styles of speech
Gotta teach, and those that be lost I will find them of course -
Then give them the power to speak
Like a captain, [stabbin?] [???] the head of lieutenants
Funky new music I'm in it, spin it -
Life let the lessons begin
One to ten, we're all original men, come again
Poor Righteous Teachers are not making friends -
Don't believe it ask Tim - Baylor - cause Tim Baylor's a failure I tell you
He was slippin and slipped his whole label
They're unable to come up with hits (cause they ain't kickin shit)
I'm the teacher
Give me a set to protest what I test, In Divine Land Projects
Sneaky snakes, Divine City records these snakes that I speak of
Tamper with Poor Righteous Teachers but please!
Don't they know Poor Righteous Teachers are large?
Built from this family of Gods?
[We perform or make on the weight?] of a positive thought
As I drop my styles, I let the lessons be taught

I'm the teacher, students acknowledge the weight of my thought
Or be caught in the web of those devils
God's no illusion, I'm the teacher, I teach
Wise be not racist or rebel
I swing, while wearing the crown of the king
Vibe for vibe, [thing for thing?] I'm pulling you have seen
Poor Righteous Teachers were wisely teaching
That of the unseen
Wait
With your thought can I obtain
Feel the vibe from the crescent of Wise's brain
Droppin' pain if you claim to entertain
Power spoken, savage tamed, smooth and plain
Well yes the intellect
Lessons dropped with no sweat
I step off, you say 'damn that shit was caught'
Style dropped, lessons taught
Word is bond, as I drop my style I let the lessons be taught[Sluggy Ranks]
We don't want no weapons
No weapons!
Don't need no ammunition
No ammunition!
It's killing off the nation

[Chorus]
Guns and knives take people's lives
It's true (for real)
Whoa, it's true, ooh-yay
(x2)
(Easy Mr. Sluggy)

[Verse 1:Wise Intelligent]

I'm 'bout to rob the robbers, kill the killers
Flow stealers bear witness to the Thriller of Manila
Sluggy the singer beside the teacher
Brother J, Dark Sun Rider
Sixty six thousand seven hundred five and a half miles per hour
Submit while you circle the sun
One ton, the weight of every jewel I drop inside you
Got you wide, in a minute I'mma get you wider
God is the highest form of living mind math and matter
Negroes, compute the data
Your nation's lacking, you're at the bottom of the living line
Why? Cause Whitey screwed your simple mind
You was a God now you're the sucker of the planet Earth
And crowned your woman slut of the universe
Pimping, leaning, fiending, scheming
Trying to be the coolest nigga for some frozen other reason
That spit, it ain't slick on any known planet
Except for Pluto I believe
Three billion, six hundred eighty million miles away from something
That's why you ain't saying nothing
Heads is fronting, forty ounce and Phillies blunting
Destructing before your sleepy eyes (ooh-yay)
Teacher Wise will have you all recognize
In minutes less than five niggas ain't 'bout this
It seems as if hip hop's become a species in danger
Since rappers turned gangsta

[Chorus]
Guns and knives take people's lives
It's true
Whoa, it's true, ooh-yay ee
(x2)
(Yes it's true, come come come)

[Verse 2:Brother J]

Now Vibal Magus in the house I've come to address the drama
And season up and serve couch potato Godfathers
Overdose on movies, come up living like a script
Form an overnight mob getting paid to talk shit
Niggas please, my nickname is Mr. Freeze
I ice steel at lockdown and bring master keys
I'm chain ganging these crews, long lines of emcees
Come off the final plank, slave ships of wannabes
I journey to your roots as I burn them Zoot Suits
Revive the nigga genes revoked while playing cute
I execute studio gangsters up on the scene
Strong tug to mic cord, submits my guillotine
To eat 'em up and split 'em, 'nuff heads is rolling down
Degrading gangsta lean, black hole is going down
You're mudbone, and I stand with ranges shown
Thought you'd rule a house, soon find you're home alone
With full black intangibility
Translating my heat to unreachable degrees
Of super burn as my crew holds you in turn
Lyrics armageddon, when will you bunglers learn
That superfly groupies, braid heads and dreads too
Watch too much too gallant try to run it like the screw
Create a revolution says the realm is upon you
The righteous be the gods and the chosen be the few
It's like that uh

[Sluggy Ranks]

You can't blow breath in the end
So why you wanna take someone's life
It's not right, no it isn't wise, ooh yay ooh yay
Gotta move the right way
Don't let the devil lead you astray
That is right, whoa that is right, ooh yay ooh yay
Father send us some blessings
To wash away our sins
Stand up for the positive
Ay, and I'll deal with negative
Iy, we're killing them with conscious vibes
Killing them with positive vibes
It's nothing but conscious style ooh yay ooh yay

[Chorus]
Guns and knives take people's lives
It's true
Whoa, it's true, ooh-yay
(x2)[Verse 1: Wise Intelligent]
Something for cave dwellers
Bomb mailers and gun sellers
The lie tellers, Cinderellas, and Goodfellas
The gun packers, crack backers, and loot stackers
Sam's crackers, New World Order is here actors
The globe holders, the population controllers
Disease makers a.k.a. AIDS creators
The cremators, doctors, nurses and nigga haters
That's out to get us, after making us bullshitters
The sister hitters who knock em and don't stay wit em
The human litter that whitey's about to get rid of
The same niggas supplanted the very planet
With mathematics, pure knowledge and understanding
Global famine, pursuit of the hidden manner, star spangled banner
Slave traders and kidnappers
We ain't just rappers, we changing some black situation
Teaching this nation the way to conquer stagnation
My occupation's to stimulate your elevation
To motivate and navigate through revelation

[Reprise: Wise Intellgient]
I shine the light that knowledge ignites
Excite blacks and whites through the things that I write
See, I could extend your days, send a spectrum of rays
In a westerly direction God is worthy of praise
Or I could capsize the planet, deprive you of life
Take flight, make ice of any emcees you like, I'm dat nice

[Hook 2X: Wise Intellgient]
Precise, could turn the days into nights
This mic like my life we elevate to great heights
We dat nice

[DJ Father Shah scratches]
N.I.C.E
Take these words home and think it through
Yo yo I hate to brag but damn I'm good!

[Verse 2: Wise Intelligent]
Word, life is what you make it holler to the almighty
Frighty Whitey never will learn to like me
My state of being as the all eye seeing, seeing human beings
On the brink of extinct
Mind vocalize only prove to incline
One time in time I turn the water to wine
Combine X and Y, created physical Gods
No lie because I heard that if I did I would die
This vi-olent envi-ronment
Full of crackatalism, politricks and 10%-ers
Who know the truth but hold it back from the youth
There's proof that Jesus Christ was a so called spook
Revelations Chapter One 13 and 16 "wool hair" "bronze skin"
Jesus was blacker than me
I'll prove and I claim that the truth has been changed
For the lies and the white supremacy to remain
That chain on your brain makes it hard to maintain
Colin Ferguson burst on them, hollow points spurting em

[Reprise: Wise Intellgient]

[Hook: Wise Intellgient]

[DJ Father Shah scratches]

[Verse 3: Wise Intelligent]
Perfection, forever living, giving tongues to the dumb
G is for God, where did "gangsta" come from?
Wisdom, words and actions making knowledge for real
Witness the days when brothers have to kill or be killed
God's will will be done, the kingdom will come
Ra East the God seed, keep perfecting it, son
The Wise one ain't done
Six sextillion tons Earth
I levitate, hold the universe in place, wait
I hear debate, come look God in the face
Place your empty thoughts with the limited ways
Erase your earthly ass at the speed of 1-1-2-0
Feet per second but still you act slow
There go some Negro, confiscating my flow, ditto
This information take it home and make a plus lesson

[Reprise: Wise Intellgient]

Me come inna dance fi make a rhyme like ganja AK light it
Heel it up, rewind it dub the mix and let me nice it
