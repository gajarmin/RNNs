[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday

(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
(Hey you! Sittin over there)
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me "Blacula"
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill! Listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga. Now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a Stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6-1, 225: pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim G
Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Outro]
I know you're bobbin your head. Cause I can see you
You can't see me!
Death Row, let me know you in the house (Beyotch!)[Jay-Z]
Uh huh yea, yeah
Duro!
You gotta let it bump
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on bring the chorus in

[Hook]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

[Jay-Z Talking about his best friend]
I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga

[Hook] x2

[Jay-z Talking about his mother]
I know mama, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was weezing
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine

[Hook] x2

Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red if you're wrong my nigga
You’re my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

[Hook] x4[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Journey with me into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind state
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck-buck, lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off, niggas get hauled off
(Barrel one) tears your motherfuckin' flesh
(Barrel two) tears your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool it's your bedtime
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infrared aimed at your head like your name was Sarah Connor
Decapitation, I ain't hesitating to put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver and his name is Revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag and you're frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller, than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler, cause I'm a natural born killa

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker (yeah what's up)
It feels like I'm busting a nut when I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb-ass raps to make your lungs collapse, perhaps
You never sleep cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how you're livin'
I'm the unforgiving, psycho-driven murderer
It's authentic, don't panic
I can't stand it, goddamn it, schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit em with a brick and I'm dancin'

[RBX]
Mass murderer, Natural Born Killa
And I don't wanna die
I DON'T WANNA DIE
I DON'T WANNA
I DON'T WANNA DIE

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams of Strychnine
Dumpin' on any motherfucker trying to trick mine
Cause punk motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold and they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain, migraine headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Get his ass whipped with 20 lashes like that dude up in Singapore
So I'ma pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Tic Toc, Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keeping niggas in order, making their lives shorter
Ready to slaughter
Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter or a dime
Mushrooms got my mind
Hallucinating
Ain't no debating
I'm creating an escape route to be out without a doubt
Scot-free, so don't even think about trying to stop me
Cause I can't wait, I'm out the gate
On the for realla, a thrilla or a natural born killa

[Verse 5:Ice Cube]
GI-GI GI-GI GAGA, THEY CALL ME DADA
6 million ways to murder, choose one
Lose one soul, bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggas going bump in the night...

[Hook 3x: Ice Cube]
Should I peely
Should I kill her in my iller
Than a Natural Born Killa[Intro]
Son, you smell that? What's that?
I smell pussy. Is that you Irv?
I smell pussy. Is that you Ja?
I smell pussy - Is that you Black?
I smell pussy. Is that you Tah?
Y'all niggas is pussy
I'm balling out nigga now watch me (watch me)
Ain't nothing you can do to stop me
Y'all niggas get so emotional
You remind me of my bitch...

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It's not of my nature to make a commitment, so let me breathe
What she doesn't understand - catch attitudes when I leave her
My other relations just make it harder for me to accept her as my own
She tries to tie up my phone and
I'm not at home; she's thinking I'm not alone
Probably out tryin' to bone anything in the street
I let her know she can leave I ain't tryin' to tie her up but see
It's hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me
Mami, I'm not your regular nigga; I know the game
But I don't play by the rules; I'm focusing on my moves
That way I will never lose
See, I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Bentleys with 22s
You say I confuse you play little tricks with your head
Catching feelings ever since the first time I slept in your bed, hun
I'm not here to tease you, mislead you, or sell you dreams
I can't say I love you I don't know what that means
I'm a pimp

[Hook x2: 50 Cent]
Baby you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy with out takin' ecstasy

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
When I first met her, I did anything to get her
Paid all her bills and filled her refrigerator
Reminiscing on late nights when I tried to lay up
But couldn't get off, cause your baby would stay up
She even crashed the whip, tryin' to switch in the third lane
That's when I realized, this bitch was a bird brain
A pigeon writing her baby pops in the box in prison
Sing-Sing is where he been in
She in the Gucci tights and Fendi high heels
Baby wipes and cans of Enfamil
Motorbikes and grams of fishscale
So 9-to-5 niggas was no frills
Turning young niggas with principles to old men with debts
And all the prank calls was death threats
That bitch got the best sex - all across the globe
And the bitch head game was out of control

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I wonder when I'm gone if you miss me
Or do you miss that Don Perignon and that Christy
I'm fuckin with you
I'm feeling your shape; I'm feeling your eyes
Later on, I'm feeling your ass and feeling your thighs
Sweetheart, you book smart and street smart
I knew you was my type from the very, very start
I'm in to tongue kissing; foreplay all day
Momma ain't home, so the noise is okay
ODB - you know we like it the raw way
Latex; safe sex; no hickeys on the neck
Now you're learning
The lords blesses make me wiser as the world's turning
My tongue touch the right spot; I'll have your toes curling
Whether we just kicking it or we sexing
I'm a pro, baby girl; I spit game to perfection
So when niggas make mistakes, I correct 'em and
When niggas get out of line, I check them man

[Hook x2][Background Music]

That's whassup niggaArtist: Sam Sneed f/ Dr. Dre
Album: Murder Was The Case soundtrack
Song: U Better Recognize

Sam (Dre):
(I heard Sam was going solo) God damn, you didn't know so
Well I can blast fast so freak an ill type of slow flow
I'm hitting harder than Barry Bonds so check the golden child
Throwing it to your ear-hole, got you going buck wild
But trump-tracks, rhymes all day, breaking off niggas proper
Did dirt, dipped West cause I clown coppers (yeah)
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em most, I couldn't see me
Mad advanced and my skills are all about the dollar bills
From Pittsburgh to Cali dropping bombs like that
Was on the D.L. with the squad so I couldn't hold it back
Black, I regulate I buzz a big gate figure
Mobbing with the ill nigga, with his finger on a bigger trigger
Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps)
Making dough, eating shrimps, locing with some real pimps (yeah)
So peep game, best believe I love my peeps
That's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
(that's right)
So buck my sound, I put it down for the underground
I got the women cause I'm slamming, jamming
Got it going on this time for this new producer to rise
So open your eyes, I think you better recognize

Dre: (Sam)
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) (2x)

Sam: (Dre)
I remember days on the blocks where I slang slung played punk cops
And mad props cause I ran with hard rocks (yeah)
From napalms to Uzi's I made G's (say what?)
Them build up enough Luther by keys
No gang affiliation, yo I stood on my own to pulling capers
I'm a sneaky slick nigga, I never had to pull the trigger (right)
I mack, and on top and that I'm used to staying wicked with just 24-7
You can ask my ex-hooker
But now I'm on some new improved shit
Making hits, stacking chips, now everything's legitimate
I flipped the script a long time ago, on the five-o
When I had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow (uhm)
Yes indeedy, I wasn't greedy, got my niggas out the gutter
Now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy
Hip hop fanatic causing static in the industry
These whack creators, I call 'em imitators (ah yeah)
Been trying to see me, but see I'm unexplanatory
With the fame and glory, that's why I gotta tell my story
With no disguise, a lot of niggas despise
Because I'm on an uprise, so I think you better recognize

Dre: (Sam)
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) (2x)
(Think you better recognize) (2x)

Sam: (Dre)
Well I'm back in the mix with a bottle of hennessy
So fire up a blunt let's have an end of the sanity
Crazy shot outs giving pounds to all my niggas
Hitting all the hookers by the dozen, cause they dig us (trick)
Fuck what you've heard, recognize what you be seeing
It's time to earn truth to the game human being
I'm that little bass nigga trying to get mine, fuck a nine
Cause I'll incline with the mastermind
I got my crew in my corner so I can't loose
Cause I'm paying mad dues in this record biz, I don't snooze
And suckers be popping at those idiotic egotistical type of flimflam
I can't be faded Sam-I-am
Playing with the hustlers never dealing with the knucklehead bollers
Cause boys play with toys and scholars play with dollars
I'm a mack of my own right, plus my game is tight
Baby get it right, I ain't the one, so take flight
Bitches give my mad rep, nothing but the brazen off tempo
Thinking they can get my loot, I never trip to knock the boots
I gotta be wise, when time to dip between the thies
All eyes on the prize, so I think you better recognize

Dre: (Sam)
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) (2x)

[Tray Dee]
Call me whenever, but never ever after 10
Cuz I got to be at home with my bitch and my kids

Get to diggin in ya ligaments then bust ya heart
Cuz from the start, soon as we sparked the bag I brought
I seen you chokin through the smoke noticed your titties was taut
You caught, up in the game that I came to spit
I cracked the hennessey and entered DP gangsta shit
You wanna get with this, or is you in to twist
The game up and make me cum just to say you came up
And gained what another strike on your rap
When you coulda kept your mouth shut and right on the step
With the program knowin damn well you wrong girl
Cuz I shook you and took two of your homegirls
You played yourselves so I had to leave
Baby shoulda just chilled off this bag of weed

(Chorus x2)
(Somebody's calling)
I'll bring the bag of weed

Listen boo, nobody in the world is perfect
So when you 'round my team there's no need to be nervous
I hit it from the back, pull out your tracks
Cause curiosity girl, kills the cat

[Hook] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Joe]
Wanna make you mine baby
See I gotta make you mine baby
Wanna make you mine baby
I gotta make you mine baby, ohhhhh
So curious, so curious {*fades out*}[Intro]
Son, you smell that? What's that?
I smell pussy. Is that you Irv?
I smell pussy. Is that you Ja?
I smell pussy - Is that you Black?
I smell pussy. Is that you Tah?
Y'all niggas is pussy
I'm balling out nigga now watch me (watch me)
Ain't nothing you can do to stop me
Y'all niggas get so emotional
You remind me of my bitch...

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It's not of my nature to make a commitment, so let me breathe
What she doesn't understand - catch attitudes when I leave her
My other relations just make it harder for me to accept her as my own
She tries to tie up my phone and
I'm not at home; she's thinking I'm not alone
Probably out tryin' to bone anything in the street
I let her know she can leave I ain't tryin' to tie her up but see
It's hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me
Mami, I'm not your regular nigga; I know the game
But I don't play by the rules; I'm focusing on my moves
That way I will never lose
See, I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Bentleys with 22s
You say I confuse you play little tricks with your head
Catching feelings ever since the first time I slept in your bed, hun
I'm not here to tease you, mislead you, or sell you dreams
I can't say I love you I don't know what that means
I'm a pimp

[Hook x2: 50 Cent]
Baby you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy with out takin' ecstasy

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
When I first met her, I did anything to get her
Paid all her bills and filled her refrigerator
Reminiscing on late nights when I tried to lay up
But couldn't get off, cause your baby would stay up
She even crashed the whip, tryin' to switch in the third lane
That's when I realized, this bitch was a bird brain
A pigeon writing her baby pops in the box in prison
Sing-Sing is where he been in
She in the Gucci tights and Fendi high heels
Baby wipes and cans of Enfamil
Motorbikes and grams of fishscale
So 9-to-5 niggas was no frills
Turning young niggas with principles to old men with debts
And all the prank calls was death threats
That bitch got the best sex - all across the globe
And the bitch head game was out of control

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I wonder when I'm gone if you miss me
Or do you miss that Don Perignon and that Christy
I'm fuckin with you
I'm feeling your shape; I'm feeling your eyes
Later on, I'm feeling your ass and feeling your thighs
Sweetheart, you book smart and street smart
I knew you was my type from the very, very start
I'm in to tongue kissing; foreplay all day
Momma ain't home, so the noise is okay
ODB - you know we like it the raw way
Latex; safe sex; no hickeys on the neck
Now you're learning
The lords blesses make me wiser as the world's turning
My tongue touch the right spot; I'll have your toes curling
Whether we just kicking it or we sexing
I'm a pro, baby girl; I spit game to perfection
So when niggas make mistakes, I correct 'em and
When niggas get out of line, I check them man

[Hook x2][Intro]

(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

[Hook]

Keep the feds ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep the feds ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep the feds ringin'

[Verse]

Yo buck buck shots when I pass the block
Yo the Desert Eagle ran out, so pass the Glock
Time to kick the fuckin' door down, past a knock
I ain't got beef with cops, I just whoop ass a lot
And I get asked to stop, but they don’t understand
That I got my own brand of justice, so I
Take the law into my hands, fuck this
Castrate a rapist, drain him out, bloodless
If you a bully, let’s test out your toughness
I’m Frank Castle, I punish for fun kid, I love this
Furious as fuck, I’m the jury and the judge
And I leave a murder scene lookin' real gory
Beg for your life when I pull the knife, same story
If we on the same side, why the feds lookin' for me?
Vigilante on the beat from Andre
Call me Dexter motherfucker, this is my laboratory

[Hook]

(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep the feds ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep the feds ringin'

[Outro]

Watch your fuckin' step kid
T-e-double-n
With my foot up in your ass[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday

(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
(Hey you! Sittin over there)
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me "Blacula"
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill! Listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga. Now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a Stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6-1, 225: pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim G
Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Outro]
I know you're bobbin your head. Cause I can see you
You can't see me!
Death Row, let me know you in the house (Beyotch!)[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Journey with me into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind state
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck-buck, lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off, niggas get hauled off
(Barrel one) tears your motherfuckin' flesh
(Barrel two) tears your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool it's your bedtime
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infrared aimed at your head like your name was Sarah Connor
Decapitation, I ain't hesitating to put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver and his name is Revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag and you're frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller, than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler, cause I'm a natural born killa

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker (yeah what's up)
It feels like I'm busting a nut when I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb-ass raps to make your lungs collapse, perhaps
You never sleep cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how you're livin'
I'm the unforgiving, psycho-driven murderer
It's authentic, don't panic
I can't stand it, goddamn it, schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit em with a brick and I'm dancin'

[RBX]
Mass murderer, Natural Born Killa
And I don't wanna die
I DON'T WANNA DIE
I DON'T WANNA
I DON'T WANNA DIE

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams of Strychnine
Dumpin' on any motherfucker trying to trick mine
Cause punk motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold and they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain, migraine headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Get his ass whipped with 20 lashes like that dude up in Singapore
So I'ma pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Tic Toc, Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keeping niggas in order, making their lives shorter
Ready to slaughter
Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter or a dime
Mushrooms got my mind
Hallucinating
Ain't no debating
I'm creating an escape route to be out without a doubt
Scot-free, so don't even think about trying to stop me
Cause I can't wait, I'm out the gate
On the for realla, a thrilla or a natural born killa

[Verse 5:Ice Cube]
GI-GI GI-GI GAGA, THEY CALL ME DADA
6 million ways to murder, choose one
Lose one soul, bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggas going bump in the night...

[Hook 3x: Ice Cube]
Should I peely
Should I kill her in my iller
Than a Natural Born KillaArtist: Sam Sneed f/ Dr. Dre
Album: Murder Was The Case soundtrack
Song: U Better Recognize

Sam (Dre):
(I heard Sam was going solo) God damn, you didn't know so
Well I can blast fast so freak an ill type of slow flow
I'm hitting harder than Barry Bonds so check the golden child
Throwing it to your ear-hole, got you going buck wild
But trump-tracks, rhymes all day, breaking off niggas proper
Did dirt, dipped West cause I clown coppers (yeah)
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em most, I couldn't see me
Mad advanced and my skills are all about the dollar bills
From Pittsburgh to Cali dropping bombs like that
Was on the D.L. with the squad so I couldn't hold it back
Black, I regulate I buzz a big gate figure
Mobbing with the ill nigga, with his finger on a bigger trigger
Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps)
Making dough, eating shrimps, locing with some real pimps (yeah)
So peep game, best believe I love my peeps
That's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
(that's right)
So buck my sound, I put it down for the underground
I got the women cause I'm slamming, jamming
Got it going on this time for this new producer to rise
So open your eyes, I think you better recognize

Dre: (Sam)
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) (2x)

Sam: (Dre)
I remember days on the blocks where I slang slung played punk cops
And mad props cause I ran with hard rocks (yeah)
From napalms to Uzi's I made G's (say what?)
Them build up enough Luther by keys
No gang affiliation, yo I stood on my own to pulling capers
I'm a sneaky slick nigga, I never had to pull the trigger (right)
I mack, and on top and that I'm used to staying wicked with just 24-7
You can ask my ex-hooker
But now I'm on some new improved shit
Making hits, stacking chips, now everything's legitimate
I flipped the script a long time ago, on the five-o
When I had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow (uhm)
Yes indeedy, I wasn't greedy, got my niggas out the gutter
Now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy
Hip hop fanatic causing static in the industry
These whack creators, I call 'em imitators (ah yeah)
Been trying to see me, but see I'm unexplanatory
With the fame and glory, that's why I gotta tell my story
With no disguise, a lot of niggas despise
Because I'm on an uprise, so I think you better recognize

Dre: (Sam)
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) (2x)
(Think you better recognize) (2x)

Sam: (Dre)
Well I'm back in the mix with a bottle of hennessy
So fire up a blunt let's have an end of the sanity
Crazy shot outs giving pounds to all my niggas
Hitting all the hookers by the dozen, cause they dig us (trick)
Fuck what you've heard, recognize what you be seeing
It's time to earn truth to the game human being
I'm that little bass nigga trying to get mine, fuck a nine
Cause I'll incline with the mastermind
I got my crew in my corner so I can't loose
Cause I'm paying mad dues in this record biz, I don't snooze
And suckers be popping at those idiotic egotistical type of flimflam
I can't be faded Sam-I-am
Playing with the hustlers never dealing with the knucklehead bollers
Cause boys play with toys and scholars play with dollars
I'm a mack of my own right, plus my game is tight
Baby get it right, I ain't the one, so take flight
Bitches give my mad rep, nothing but the brazen off tempo
Thinking they can get my loot, I never trip to knock the boots
I gotta be wise, when time to dip between the thies
All eyes on the prize, so I think you better recognize

Dre: (Sam)
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) (2x)
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) (2x)[Prince Ital]
Watch it, watch it - Daz is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Kurupt is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Doggystyle is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
You might be shootin, inna de place
Iffa eedyot ever disrespectin, nowww..

[Kurupt]
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke
And the bombest weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
A big shout out, to my niggas in (?)Darby Twip(?)
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact

[Bridge]
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere

[Daz]
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast(?) or at home
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown

[Bad Azz]
At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demandin my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
To the point of no return - so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust, I let loose
This is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp (the deal is) the deal is this
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon

[Techniec]
With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MC's'll be G's
Also D-P-G's and, L-B-C's when
We do the do to you so go call your crew
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts that's bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia
And I'ma, gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
(Watch out nigga!)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a sucker MC barbecue cookout
Look out.. watch out now!
Ha-ha yeah, witcha bad self, watch out![Scarface]
Fears weightless, I fear none in the physical form
Let us face, nigga, you can't do me no harm
Up here shakin, wishin me well, but deep in you heart
You wantin me close to make sure I dont ease in the dark
And squeeze wit thought, and leave you with the hole in your head
For wantin me dead, but I come to watch you suffer instead
Like burnin your bed, cuz I dont want your blood on my hands
That's not in my plan, to unstrap it and murda ya man, I murda ya man
And I go home and got your blood on my clothes, and I'll be guilty
But werent you the one who stepped on my toes, So I ain't guilty
At least thats how I see it inside, an eye for an eye
He challenge me and he gotta die, so I send him a kite
To let him know that wasn't right, and he in my sight
And I can't let him leave in the night, and he seein his life
Flashin right in front of his face, for fuckin wit face
This what you get for fuckin wit face

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Open your eyes, cuz seein is believin my nigga
And stop breathin and now your ass is leavin my nigga
Protectin your chest, believin you put life in this bitch
???

[Scarface]
Break it down for me

What you want me to do, What you want me to do
What you want me to do, What you want me to do

I got in-trouble rhymes to adapt to in-trouble times
A double nine, in case niggas get out of line
And heaven knows that I done tried to change but in the midst
Of tryin to be a better me, trouble was all I could seem to see
And the facts that I know tomorrow ain't promised to be
So from this day forth, Ima be all that I can be
When my cousin turned his back on me, I had to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes was, Ima play my own hand
And im tired of bein let down be my so called friends
And regardless of the bloodshedin, ain't no tears in the end
Father please forgive me for im sinnin, forgive us all
But I ain't to blame, the lunatics were in my heart
And I think I need to build another wall
Cuz I dont want the world to see me
Cuz lately these niggas been tryin ta eat me
I'm exhausted and my body sleepy, But at lest its hard to rest
I'm a nervous wreck, I walk with stress
I used to walk around with a tech, but nowadays I be like fuck it dawg
You fuck wit me I gots to fuck wit yall
And revenge is just another word for payback
Payin you back today for this grudge that I had for you way back
You niggas knew I wouldn't play that
I sent you bitches to the morgue with two holes in your head, no remorse
Why you think my niggas call me the boss
Cuz I be dressed up in designer suits
And for the fact that these niggas know that im the truth
And I always look a man in his eyes before I shoot
And when he disrespect this man of respect, there ain't no excuse
I call on the troops, and put them dead on your case
For fuckin wit face, this what you get for fuckin wit face

[Hook]

[Scarface]
This nigga tried to hit me yo, but he killed one of my people tho
So now I got to get this ho, they say revenge is expensive so I
Chartered a plane and I hit the coast, when I ran across this kid I know
We spoke briefly but we spoke in code
Tryin deeply to destroy his soul
I keep it real cuz the streets is watchin me
??? cuz the beats is jockin me
And all in all it was a smooth ride
Except for when this dude tried to hand me this conspiracy
See, I pimp the game like its a prostitute
And I won't stop until I clock the loot
Misunderstand me and I cock and shoot
Plus, I done learned what to do and what not to do

[Hook](Priest talking)
Bad person
In the under world
The bad person or the bad egg or bad news
A bastard a black sheep a black guard
(Get 'em get 'em he's over there)
All the vagabonds thieves

(Chorus)
Look at the things we done
Oh my my my
(The burns)
We live life dangerous...
(The black the cowards)
Just dry your eyes
(The villains the criminals)
Until thee angels come
Oh my my my
(The scoundrels the robbers the racketeers)
For us
And thee angels said
(The underworlds)

Priest:
Look at the killers, dealers, scramblers
Hustlers, pimps, low lives
Are running police coming gunning jumping
Over fences hide in trenches
Fight defenses ducking bullets this that hood shit
Show more footage
Speak from pulpits
(Fellow Americans you are now under a new era)
We all are sinners angels watching
(A new world order)
Ain't no stopping the sky has cracked
You lie back, watch your end, burning skin turning in
Hell bound hell hounds
With scales down to their tails growl wild
Chasing us barking it darkens dropping revolvers in apartments
Here comes the marksman up the staircase
I start busting backwards slipping, Where's the pastor?
Too many distractions
9/11, signs from heaven find a weapon AK SK HKs MK
Mayday mayday mayday
Rocket launchers my project's bonkers
We sold drugs till it's over its time to close up
Yep, lets go - closure
Judgement day thugs must pray
Devils is running cause they realize
Something worst than hell is coming
A black bird burning down to the earth
Turning into a fire breathing dragon

(Chorus) x 2

Priest:
It seems like a giant hologram of the president head
Above my projects
Or the night crawling down like a panther
From a tree where the fog sets
Where you hear a whisper out of the darkness like
(Yo yo, 2 for 5, Yo yo come here shorty shorty shorty
Come here come here I got something for you)
Priest beloved immortal travel through portals
Behold the pharaoh before you
I was once a radical poor dude that stood on the corner
Teaching blacks were the lost Jews
Why? Cause my people were deprived of Yale and law schools
(Damn) Now they walk around with a head full of lost screws
Never been into rabbit foots or horse shoes
Or superstitions trying to make me lose my vision look up
The nukes are in position

Obadiah aka Ambassador:
Rebuke the system my people are too conditioned too persistent
Many will come but few would listen Razah Priest and Obadiah
A new dimension choose your henchmen
It's crucial business salute attention to the roots and lineage

(Chorus) x 2

Hell Razah:
We surrounded by births, abortions, churches, organs
Don't bury me these Romans will only dig up my coffin
We was orphans who was born in the wars and slave auctions
KKK better pray for the day they burnt them crosses
We the spooks who threw them torches up inside the Bush's office
Wicked forces kiss their daughters and sons and take precaution
Now that Priest released this offering
Renaissance reborn again
My pen drip the ink for the saints
Blood of the sphinx
Kiss my owl on his head
While I feed him unleavened bread
Point the infrared on enemies who wish to see me dead
The Pope opened up and read Revelations then he bled
I met an angel and he said to drop the gun that's on my leg

Priest:
I rolled up out of my bed walked on synagogue floors
My house, cathedral ceilings with Egyptian walls
My dinning room last supper style
Twelve chairs with king Tut cups cave bathrooms and medieval tiles

(Chorus) x 2

Ha ha ha ha
Where you going
You ain't going nowhere
Bring your asses to me
You coming with tonight (hahahahahah)
You coming with me
You did too much to forgive

"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit
And a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent
Which is called the Devil, and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, And cast him into
The bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive
The nations no more, till the end of a thousand years be fulfilled: (Rev. 20:1-3 KJV)."
