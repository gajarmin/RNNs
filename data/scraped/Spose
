[Intro]
Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome
I don't necessarily have to be here for this
I'm gonna keep the headphones though

[Chorus]
Mother fucker I'm awesome!
No you're not, dude don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Mother fucker I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voice mail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall

[Verse 1]
You know my pants sag low (low)
Even though (though) that went out of style
Like ten years ago (go)
Spose, I got the swagger of a cripple
I got little biceps
Getting fatter in the middle
And lyrically I'm not the best
Physically the opposite of Randy Moss and yet
So preposterous
Feel the awesomeness, the most obnoxious guest
Up at the sausage fest
Oh yes
The girls are repulsed
So I hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult
I'm as nervous as my cat, ol' Dirty Curtis
All my writtens are bitten and
All my verses are purchased
Me? I'll never date an actress
Got too many back zits
Plus my whole home aroma is cat piss
Every show I do is poorly promoted
And if you like this?
It's cause my little sister wrote it

[Chorus]

[Scratching]
The swagger of a cripple

[Verse 2]
Check it out
I'm from Maine and I don't hunt (nope)
And I can't ski
Smoke weed but I can't roll blunts
Find me whipped by my wifey
My neck not icy
Eatin' at McDonalds because Subway is pricey
Ha, and my uni-brow is plucked
Just asked my mom if I could borrow ten bucks
She's like, "For what?
Blunt wraps and some Heinekens?
You skinny prick, go get a gym membership and vitamins!"
I'm like, "Mom please, don't blame it on me
I got my bad habits from you, Dad, and Aunt Steve."
My attitude's sour but my futon's sweet
And the hair on my ass, it is Jumanji
Suit un-tailored, ringtone Taylor Swift
Can't tweet up on my Twitter
Cause I haven't done shit
Bank account red, body ungroomed
The only good thing about me is I'm off stage soon

[Chorus]
I'm awesome!
No you're not, dude don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Mother fucker I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voice mail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall
I'm awesome

[Scratched]
Suit untailored, ringtone Taylor Swift

[Verse 3]
Furthermore I'm cornier than Ethanol
Cheesier than Provolone
I spent ages eight to ten living in a motor home
With a ego the size of Tim Duncan
Even though I got shit for brains like a blumpkin
I'm twenty four, serving lobster rolls
Because I spent a decade filling Optimos
And I'm not even the bomb in Maine
On my game I'm only about as sexy as John McCain
Now put your hands up
If you have nightmares
If you wouldn't man up if there was a fight here
If you got dandruff
If you drink light beer
I'm outta breath

[Chorus]
But I'm awesome!
No you're not, dude don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Mother fucker I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voice mail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall
I'm awesome[Verse 1]
What's up?
I'm sorry to interupt your evening at the eatery
I'm about to freak, what you believe
Unbelievably
You will see
Everytime Sparker, comma, Peter speaks
It's bacon for the jews and gay marriage for the Jesus freaks
VHS tapes flying out the red box
All the Yankee's fans cheerin' for the Red Sox
And the neo nazis, all growing dread locks
Listening into Erykah Badu
Until their head nods
I got Facebook accounts for the Amish
Throw a little steak in
While I'm makin'
Vegan's omelettes
Democrats out huntin' in the forestry
Republicans giving tax cuts to minorities
All the beer snobs
Chillin', sippin Natty Ice
While I take a bachelor
And match him with a battered wife
Got the Hipsters
Clothes shopping at Wall-Mart
Hanging with the B-Team
Acting like they're all stars
Unplugging tanning booths
In Little Italy
Hanging with some country music fans
Bumping Lil B
Making A&R's
Spit bars and vans
While I'm reading poetry to some Nascar fans

[Bridge]
Look, it's Peter Sparker in this bitch
I'm the people's douche
And I will never quit until the day I see the poor become the rich
Or the rich become the poor
So they're holding open doors
For the single moms who buy their food up at the dollar store

[Verse 2]
I got some alpha males thinking they're lame
Donald Trump just asked me for spare change
The Westboro baptist church is having gay sex
While I got the sneaker heads
Shopping up in payless
Then I got the teenagers all leaving social media
And reading what a library is on Wikipedia
I can make a morning person sleep to the evening
Shit I got Lebron James moving back to Cleaveland
I can get the housewives to all stop gossiping
And get the Taliban startin' all girls colleges (colleges)
Illiterate people, they all want to read about it
Let's do something sweet and not tweet about it
Dead beat dads asking where the diapers are
Drag queens all dancing in the biker bar
Jocks giving geeks props as the pass in the hall
I got Kobe Bryant passing the ball

[Hook]
It's Peter Sparker in this bitch
I'm the people's douche
And I will never quit until the day I see the poor become the rich
Or the rich become the poor
So they're holding open doors
For the single moms who buy their food up at the dollar store
Man the day is gonna come when the bosses will be generous
And all the employees will get some benefits
For once
And until the day it does
You know I'm your fucking bud
It's the people's douche
Now let me see those dirty hands up!

Put your hands up!
If you only got a dollar in your pocket
And this shit ain't enough!
Put your hands up!
Put your hands up!
If you're not here to put 'em up
Cause you had to work and couldn't come!

[Hook][Intro]
Welcome back to sunny Wells, Maine

[Verse 1]
Guess who's back off the couch
Got the panties in a drought
Duct taping Casey Anthony's mouth
It's Mr. "no you're not dude"
Back with some hot new raps
For these kindergarteners to smoke pot to
This shit's changed since I came into the cypher
Because everyone was agro
Now they're all nicer
Pants used to sag low
Now they're all tighter
And the black dudes who rhyme are named Wayne and Tyler
Huh, we must've smoked something funky
Somewhere back there and we all go the munchies
Ate Hershey's Cookies and Cream and got clumsy
Cause there's white rappers everywhere and nobody's hungry
You used to have to pay dues
They pay dudes
To get YouTube views
While they play beirut
Enabling fake crews
To take spots
I heard Sam Adams and it made me miss Aesop Rock
Yeah the one-hit wonder guy who raps is back
To make your thunder thighs giggle if your ass is fat
With some fact packed anglo-saxon backpacked tracks
My dishwasher's got racks on racks

[Chorus]
I got 'em like gee willikers, fuck that shit
I bet he doesn't know any black kids
I got 'em like gee golly man what a shit show
I knew I hated Spose from the get-go
Gee willikers, I know I can't lose
Making rap songs that these strippers can't dance to
Gee golly I'm the same old cat I, I, I, I keep it bimpin'

[Verse 2]
What's up? I'm Spose if you didn't know
The representative of people who got little dough
And I never spit a rhyme trying to get a ho
I'm not trying to put the big 'L' in Deuce Bigalow
Nor am I trying to be the hardest dude
Or act like it's all good bro no barbecues
A grimy, major label signed me
To a situation hairy as vaginas in the 90's
Find me back in Maine cacklin'
Still got weed like 'we would' as a contraction
I still sip ship yards pigs lingerin'
Spit bars back woods in my fingerprints
Some couplets I come up with seem funny
Other pairs are hair raising like I breed bunnies
I'm still ungroomed, I'm back in the flesh
I spit it raw, unbridled like a bachelorette
Check it I know that the folks don't listen
Dissing - though other bros don't spit efficient
Broke - had the soap, did dishes in kitchens
Hooks and 'allure' like this is fishing
I'm banking on taking the bacon and making a run for the gold
I been mistakenly taken for humorous
They been been assuming I'm making a joke like...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Chord change!
You're now rocking with the town folks spokesman
Who girls think is too short but I'm not from Oakland
And it's been years since I deposited tokens
But I've been in the game getting bread, you're just loafin'
This is the voice of the villagers not sitting back scared to act whispering
"gee willikers" nah, this is an uprising
Dudes are just rhyming
I've fantasized about this when I was just Ryan
Come kick it with the aged liquor, sipper, slipper, rocker
Picked the pocket of a major label, knicker bocker
Sagging, keep my circle tighter than some leather pants
Whole state behind me like a weather man, damn

[Chorus][Intro: Spose]

Whoops, I just made another wal-mart anthem (anthem, anthem...)
Still the opposite of tall, dark, handsome
I got junk like a thumbtack
Abs like a one pack
Couldn't run one lap
Hoes, my hobbies include knitting
Mittens, but that's only when I'm not snitching
These other MC's feel bad because
I just discovered that my brother is my real dad
The zaniest freak who rocks rhymes
Because I, simultaneously sip box wine
And I'm, nothing but a top notch slob
Mooching off my baby's mother and a drop top Saab
I'm awesome (awesome, awesome, awesome....)
(the-the sw-swa-swa-swa-swagger of a cripple)
Remix...
This is a remix

[Hook #1: Spose]

Brotherfucker, I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie
I'm awesome
I'm driving 'round in my mom's ride
I'm awesome
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all your mothers online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome
There's no voicemail, nobody called
I'm awesome
Now I got Kansas City involved

[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]

(Oh yeah, uh, check it out yo)
I'm awesome
Sitting home alone full of toxins
30 years old, looking like Macaulay Culkin
I use drugs just to hang with crazy actresses
But this ain't even cocaine
It's fucking baby laxative
Protest in public
Squirting out my dick putty
My goddamn girlfriend looks like KiD CuDi
Buddy, I'mma tear them apart
My friends are trendy assholes wearing arabic scarves
(Oh you fancy, huh?)
Nope, I'm just awesome
Beginner level, Street Fighter 4, using Dahlsim
I make more money selling oxy than I could performin'
I'm masturbating while I'm reading through the book of Mormon
At my grandmother's funeral drunk
But it won't start until
I get her body out of the trunk
My name is Mac Lethal, my style is explosive
Here, have a blunt
My little sister rolled it

[Hook #2: Mac Lethal]

She's awesome
We make it rain, and we give it
I'm awesome
Done with your girl in 3 minutes
I'm awesome
Laying on the couch takes work
I'd beat Nikki Minaj at Wii Tennis
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
Never run away from the cops
I'm awesome
Every single day smoking crops
I'm awesome
North Korea, you're fucking up
I'm snacking on a push-up pop
Motherfucker I'm awesome (awesome, awesome, awesome...)

[Verse 2: Spose]

(How you living Spizzy Spose?)
Oh where should I begin?
Nissan whip, four cylinder engine (vroom vroom)
All my clothes got Jnco emblems and
Ah-he-heh-hem, all my friends are pretend (lame)
Juggalos, I blend in with them
Sip wine coolers, watching Nickelodeon
Look, I'm no Don Juan with the blonde babes
Because my belly's getting bulbous, my chest is concave
Chicks in Maine get migraines when my song plays
French chicks tell me "No parle Anglais" (excuse me)
I'm at your kid's first birthday
Gin bombay, interrupting that shit
Like I'm Kanye (Yo I'mma let you finish)
I'm in a house full of cats (rawr)
McDonald's snack wraps in the trash out back
I'm awesome, I'm getting shunned by the bloggers
While I'm sitting in a kiddie pool reading Harry Potter
I'm not lying, dude
Ask my neighbors
Taco Bell what I bought with the paper
And I don't even start shit with the haters
I weigh about the same as a fat third grader (sup girl)
And 2010's been strange, wierd
Unemployed, signed in the same year
My pajama pants got reindeer
While I'm up at Applebee's drinking sangria

[Hook #3: Spose]

I'm awesome
My stomach hurts because I can't burp
I'm awesome
Fred Durst just wrote my last verse
I'm awesome
I'm puking up yogurt because
I think I look fat in this shirt
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
Whip exterior wood grain
I'm awesome
I just watched a softball game
I'm awesome
I'm the least famous person with fame
On stage with my clothes all stained
Motherfucker I'm awesome[Hook]

See me riding in the '03 Altima
Feeling like a boss
Cause I just got paid
And I got the day off
60 hours last week
That's 700 bucks
Now I can pay my speeding ticket and buy bud

[Verse 1]

Man I've been broke since last
Saturday I had to go to coinstar with a jar just to get gas
To get to work where I'm flipping burgers 'til I get swamp ass
My folks don't own no business
I just cut fish and hit dishes
But when it's pay day
I'm Bimpin'
I've got old dudes in my pants, pause
Ulysses S Grant, dawg
Had a lot of long days now
I'm whipping bimpin' bumping Andre and Antwan
That's Outkast, I'm a misfit
I got no whips for Christmas
My broke folks if you listening sing this shit

You can fuck way more women, spend way more cash
You could rock 2 chains, you could kick my ass
You could drink more liquor, you could smoke more weed
But you'd never feel as good as me

[Hook]

When I'm riding in the '03 Altima
Feeling like a boss
Cause I just got paid
And I got the day off
60 hours last week
That's 700 bucks
Now I can pay my speeding ticket and buy bud

[Verse 2]

Let me see your hands high
If you're cashlow
If your manager is an asshole
If your favorite band broke up
But you couldn't get the shift off for their last show
You're working 9 days a week, now
You and your girl don't speak, but
When you get your paycheck
You can buy the liquor that'll make her wanna freak

Do that shit that makes you feel personally
Like spose does when he puts a verse to beats
When you get to upgrade from commercial weed
And you stop by your work for just a beat
Cause you're a have not
Got a padlock
On the bulkhead
Your dad's spot
Then yell this shit like Ad-Rock when it mmm drops

You can fuck way more women, spend way more cash
You could rock 2 chains, you could kick my ass
You could drink more liquor, you could smoke more weed
But you'd never feel as good as me

[Hook]

When I'm riding in the '03 Altima
Feeling like a boss
Cause I just got paid
And I got the day off
60 hours last week
That's 700 bucks
Now I can pay my speeding ticket and buy bud

[Verse 3]

I just got a order in right after I cleaned the grill, cleaned the grill
I've been working overtime but it still doesn't cover the bills, don't cover the bills
My landlord raised my rent again, then my boss cut my hours back, cut my hours back
So how will i get ahead unless they cut me some slack, cut me some slack

Man, my credit isn't rated A
So you know where I'll be
Working, burning pirated CD's
Whipping with my gas tank on E
Dress like I don't give an F
Bank account negative one G
Can't afford to say H I to a J
But if you hit me on payday
I'll front the loop
I'll buy the bag
I'll cop the beer
I'll pay the tab
I'll drive the whip
I'll buy the gas
I got this shit
Don't gotta pay me back
I'm feeling like I'm Shawn Carter
Daley Puffy Combs and when it's all gone

[Hook]

Fuck it
I'm still ridin' in my '03 Altima
Feeling like a boss
Cause I just got paid
And I got the day off
60 hours last week
That's 700 bucks
Now I can pay my speeding ticket and buy budAin't shit changed still bony no bowflex
Googling some titties while my girl won't give me throat sex (swag)
Stressing, strung out, kotex
Wishing I can get my money back from my old checks
American proletariat derelict no inheritance heiresses think my lair is embarrassing
I'm the stoner Spider Man ripping chemical vitamins
Spit it general cyphering and gripping emerald heinekens
I sold LP's smoked lb's
You smell me? that's Wells, beach
I'm on my soil chilling on a winter's night
I ran out of oil, that's that shit I don't like
Came in the game with a brain not an amulet
I need the cannabis not what is on the mannequin
I procreated so you know I need the money
Must've saw me looking scrawny and they thought he wasn't hungry

Chorus:
I'm starving, I'm starving
Shit I'll eat all the food in your apartment
I'm starving, I'm starving
I might even eat the shit up out the garbage
I'm starving, I'm starving
I'll eat the whole turkey you ain't gotta carve it
I'm starving, I'm starving
I'll eat the walls and the ceiling and the carpet

Yo it's that ugly white rapper, no not Paul Wall
But the one from the north who doesn't say "all y'all"
I got a ten sack that's like eight more balls
And I'm gonna blow trees until the acorns fall, ayup
It's like I'm riding in a beamer
When I'm in a Nissan with Ryan Peters on the speakers, ayup
Same shit, people that I came with
Still up in Maine bitch I ain't that famous
And this isn't commercial
But it would be if I hadn't been dropped from Universal
They say you gotta pay to fly
You want filets on a plane well them stakes is high
So I'm sitting at McDonalds I don't got a dollar
I might spit in it then sip the saliva out the bottle
I procreated so you know I need the money
Must've saw me looking scrawny and they thought he wasn't hungry

Chorus

(Bring it)
This is East of Eden mixed with reasonable doubt
Made an album for the label but they never put it out
Paid my dues now I'm waiting on a couch
Made enough off rap for down payments on a house ayup
Come hither the blunt and drum hitter
The humble humdinger the mumbling gun slinger
Truck beds, middle class, bud hev
Nickelback, little cash, enough said, cripple swag (spizzy)
Back like a tramp stamp locale made one-hundred grand in a month but I'm broke now
Luckily, that's what my steez is; genius
Covered up in crumbs from the cheez-its
I got the fame, minimal
Nickname, pivotal
Whip game, miserable
Rib cage, visible
I procreated so you know i need the money
Must've saw me looking scrawny and they thought he wasn't hungry

Chorus: Spose
I heard an emcee this morning that made me wanna get in the booth
And no offense to him or his crew but I know that I'm better than that dude
So what I gotta do to get his spot in hip-hop and my video on MTV2
I know it can't be the skills cause mine have been ill since 2002

Verse 1: Spose
Too many Facebook rappers to unlike
This blank sheet of paper is the shit they've done right
Whilst Peter been beating the beat up repeatedly leaving the body in Peabody seemingly nobody noticed
I figured I'd take it and make it the focus
I'm the lord grand chancellor
Backwoods ramble
Rap career canceler, bumping Fiona Apple
I'm the weird beard grower
A ghost, a feared flower
A myth, a gift shower
I been sipping on a Snapple in the cypher
You can find me I'm the wildest geek
My assignment has been rhyming been aligned to the beat
My bud kind but I'm violent when I'm rhyming delete
All pretenders who enter cause my potential's elite
He's always stressing excellent when blessing a show
My investments are destined to double bubble and grow
So, yes, in the flesh, the man, the mess, Spose
Who can still flow fresher than dressers of clean clothes
Oh, you getting to know the name I came to spell
I'm underground yeah I came from Wells
So watch me play the bass line on a belt your favorite rapper just used so he could hang himself
"But it's all good, Spose!" No it ain't so swell
Cause I'm back down to Earth like some angels fell
Cause I popped up on the chart with some stained lapels
And then I disappeared faster than Dave Chappelle
Poof

[Chorus]

Verse 2: Spose
I been struggling rhyming like weed made of iron that's how hard Ive been grinding
Been neglecting assignments, dreaming of islands
But not recouping, beat looping with the droopiest eye lids
My ups and downs have both been critical
My free time is infinitesimal
Inside my ride, driving to the gig, whipping it, kicking it, ducking the piglets, fine rhymes kid
There must be a connect I can't find him yet
Don't want a private jet just rhyming checks
Hey you'll never find Ryan crying with the blues like sirens
Bro this is no sob story
Even though they're hating in their verses, I don't want sympathy this is a statement of purpose:
I will out work every motherfucker alive and those who don't fuck their moms, too
Yo, I got callouses that will amount to palaces
Analysis is cats is on my phallace, put em up
I sip McCallan talented vow to you no medallions, challenge it till paralysis, dude: put em up
If you're playing Call of Duty chilling watching television and you wonder why you're going under, shut the fuck up
But, if you never relent like you only loan

Things out once, then guess what: your day gon come

[Chorus]

Ryan Seacrest:
Some people are saying that this guy might be the next big rap star, and he's a white dude from Maine. His real name is Ryan Peters but he goes by "Spose." We need him to work some hip-hop into Bangor[Intro: Spose]

What's up world?
We're the Preposterously Dank crew, PDank for short
My man Shane Reis, Lady Essence, Mike Be, Jay Caron & Cam Groves are with you tonight
My name is Spose, we're happy to be coming to you live from Portland, Maine

If you don't like us, die

[Verse 1: Shane Reis]

Ok, the moniker is Reis, it's not spelled like Riesling
You caught me chilling with Belle in the East Wing, I'm beasting
And that's a song you don't normally hear me sing
But that being the point, that I don't point out these things
I got a job, and rap is just a hobby son
Your style's a spotty one, probably you should copy one
I let you brew in that, how could I not be one?
When I b's doing me to a T even when hockey's done
I'm a respectable young dude, fuck 'em all
Catch me in the west end, stooping with a double malt
Step upstairs, I'm eating steak with a bib on
Two Buck Chuck from Trader Joe's, I live on
Ok, I been on, the type of shit I'm on player
I'm in the bath writing raps over John Mayer
But still, I am that little brother, get back
You're more like Lil B, collaborating with Riff Raff

That's for your bitch ass

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]

Cam Groves, PDank, 2014 son

Yo, I'll turn you to a fan, buy my music on Amazon
Sleeping on Cam like they got flannel pajamas on
It's no glamour when my man flips the Canon on
Damn it's on when they put the camera on Cameron
Keep it random every time I get my ramble on
Hand the bong over, Imma jam it with a gram of chron'
Keep jammin' till I'm paid a hundred grand a song
And everyone's enamored by the land that I stand upon
Now I'm acting like there ain't no one as hot as me
Everybody got a dream, I don't do it modestly
If my music ever caught a buzz like a shot of three
I'd grab that mother fucker and then hold it like I gotta pee
Rappers wanna throttle me
Bitches wanna follow me
You don't make the cut, like assisting a lobotomy
If you think you're sicker and you wish you'd take a shot at me
You bitches stand a better chance at fixing the economy

Or hitting the lottery

[Verse 3: Mike B]

Yeah, Mighty Mike B
Ock Cousteau
Check it out

Yo, the sand was blowing on the coast, they had the cameras rolling
Suddenly, commotion is picking up and the man's approaching
The monster that swam the entire span of the ocean
He fuckin' ran, when I hit the land and I'm standin' and posin'
Dammit I'm chosen, might believe I'm not a sleeper
My right hand controls the mic and lights a lot of reefer
The scholar that taught the teacher, Be's a proper leader
And I never even need to breathe when underwater either
Preposterous, chronic in the esophagus
Royalty in the roster, plates of pasta with lobster bisque
Uh, we stay ahead of the fakes
And you gon' see me in the sea, like some negative space
Y'all are shallow and fake
I'm going for the ocean's depth
And when my vocals flex, I'm leaving locals with a broken rep
So go and check for us, we're proper when we rock the show
And watch out for the project with the audibles that's nautical
Peace

[Verse 4: Essence]

On my harbor fish shit
Yeah

I'm on my, scour the fakeness
Straight devour the stages
While tryna make up for these cowards, now go powder your faces
Let me show you why you proud of where the power in Maine is
The CMP of freaking beats while making hourly wages,  fuck your
Salary raises and your benefit jobs
You benefit when pens a life and craft a sentence for God
And cause the exodus of pegasus on a nebulous fog
Regulating record sprints while on a regular jog
I'm on my, peg your facade and then expose the real in you
Dog, your flows flawed and no one's even feeling you
It must suck to know that everything you fuckin' wrote
Truly is the weakest, keep it secret homie tuck it low
I'm on my tuck-and-roll and never had a problem with
Showing to the show so I could leave it with like all your friends
Let's call amends, for Ock walks you on the sea plank
Withs swords in your face, know your place, homie PDank

[Verse 5: Jay Caron]

Ay yo I'm hooked on phonics
Fuck it I'm hooked on chronic
Pool swimming, fly women, man my life's aquatic
I was finger fucking at 9-3, bumping Onyx
Watching the Suns game 6, it was verse the Sonics
You want brolic? Grrrr
You want knowledge? Hmmmm
I been a beast over beats since I dropped out college
From the coast, on the beach, where I feast on walrus
Send a tweet, to your peeps, that I'm awfully flawless
Good lord, it's one beat, no need for a chorus
Watch 'em spit a 16 while Red Stallion records it
Cape Porpoise, Ock see, getting endorsements
We scourging your laws, better call reinforcements
Separately strong, but stronger connected
No need to, beg for attention in order to get accepted
Loved and hated, anticipated, but highly respected
We all say "fuck it, we love it," let's put it down for the record

[Verse 6: Spose]

Look
I'm fucking starving and these rappers looking bite-sized
Non fiction, got it woven in my tight rhymes
The day I write lies? That'll be the day the Kardashians decide they're gonna fuck broke white guys
P DANK
The future is ours
They say "Oh Ryan," well that's proof I'm a star
They wanna come and kill us while we're looping the bars
But we know they all wouldn't like acoustic guitars
So who are you? We got next on it
You're doing little numbers like the exponent
My steez, wolly mammoth-type, made in Maine
Your career disappeared, like the Malaysian plane
We need an intervention, quick attention, get some friends and let 'em know my diction dances, fists are clenched, dog
The differential kid is mental, big potential, pen and pencil, quintessential, instrumental God
Mother fucking Peter

[Outro: Spose]
PDank in the house
We'll see you in 2015, 2016, 2017
Running for President in 2029, all of usIntro:
(right now)
C'est la vie up in here
Je suis l'illest
(right now)
Nous avon foumé tout le weed

Chorus:
All i do is rhyme, and smoke my weed
And spend my time
Trying to get better than me
And I'd be fine
If i never made it, but i did
So i take credit cause i changed my life
No I'm doing alright

Verse I: Spose
Look, I know you had a party and I'm sorry that I missed it
But these days I run a twenty four hour, seven day a week business
I won't even have a day off on christmas
Just to make sure I got some milk on my crispix
And I couldn't put it simpler
If you don't get it, forget it man, we must be dissimilar
I've been touring foreign places out of the perimeter
Just to get the bank account to mount another integer (Minnesota!)
Nobody told me it would not be tough
Backwoods with me and the broccolis stuffed
I got my calon on ice like a hockey puck
I'll keep making it 'til haters are like "stop, enough!"
Try to copy us, they're see through
I see it clear, tell the engineer, keep the beat looped
And look at hard times that I elude
No days off like i sold chinese food

Chorus

Verse II: Cam Groves
Cause life is short homie
And I don't have the time to lose
And I was out rhyming dude
While you were buying shoes
And it's true
Who would ever want to rue in time
With do I do with mine
All I do is rhyme
And I'm doing fine
You gotta take that chance
And stay grinding harder than jamaicans dance
I'm on stage playing for a lake of fans
While you're at home naked with your snake in hand
Crammed in the studio, I keep the beat crank
Yo you smell that weed stank?
Yo it must be pdank
Oh you like my music, girl? gee thanks
Go buy my cd kids cause i need bank
And I've always loved rap
And I've had a knack for it
Since back before I could slap a backboard
Ten years later let life fast forward
Now I'm making those tracks that the people ask for

Mother fucker![Verse 1:]
Fresh out of a love fest
Pissing in the cup
I give a fuck about a drug test
Charlie Sheen in it!
I’m biwinning, fucking five women
Fuck the maid who came and changed my linens
All I do is win when I’m playing this game
Porn star chicks, dirtier than shit stains

And two and a half men, that’s my dick’s name!
Winning!
Running trains porn slut conducted the mighty duck hockey motherfucker bro ask my brother

Coke Bearing sluts!
I use a blender, I use a vacuum
I use coke on vaginas in a bathroom!
Wining!
I’m gonna hang with these smoky hotties
While your kids whip over your exploded bodies
Like yeah I’m on a drug
Is called Charlie Sheen
I do in real life what you do in your dreams!
Tiger in my ventricle
Center full booty in my tentacles
Two million in an episode, what did you expect?
Dying is for fools, I just win and have sex
Which of these women have necks?
Interviews smoking cigarettes, I’m running trains on dames you jerk off to on the internet!
Yeah I had a family, I got a warm heart
Let’s play find Charlie’s dick, where is it?
Hint: its in a porn star, uh
I make Casey Jordan get like eight abortions
While I snorted her portion up off the porcelain and lost endorsements
Join the team, I got a couple bottles in me
I’m a coke machine, Charlie Sheen!
Winning!
You can't handle my type of drugs
Uh, put the pussy in the tiger blood

Invite my ex-wife over am I sober? No!

Too much to overdose!
Put the yayo in the pipe, put the pipe to the flame

Came to party here and to drop a couple millie
Now I’m fucking with these groupie eyed armless children

[Outro:]
I'm not from this particular terrestrial realm
Charliton
A noble men
King Charles peasants Im fucking all the peasantsIf there really is a big fluffy Jesus in the clouds
Let him know right now
That I take it all back
If there really is a muscular, cackling
Red devil in the ground
You should tell him save me a shack
But since I never saw either at my local Walmart
Shopping yelling at their kids in front of my optics
I've been operating under the premise that neither
Existed because I base my beliefs in logic
But if it's really true
Would you say when my body is in the ground
I'll either float on up or drop right down
Then I'm nervous for the verdict
As a person I'm imperfect
Ive been doing dirt lurking
In the gutter with the vermin
I dont deserve to go north when I'm gone
Glenfiddich rivers, swan shaped bongs
Some big tittied angels floating over ponds
Singing songs more soothing than
Bed, bath, and beyond
No, I deserve my skin scorched
Skies made of skulls
Sasquatch is made of fire
As I fall into a gulch everything black
I'd give my left nut and my dick
For the chance to go back

You and I both know I can't shut my mouth
But before you blow my candle out
Would you please just listen to me here right now?
Before you blow my candle out
Cause if I had a second time around, I would turn it all around

Man thats what they all say, you're done
No, no, no, no, shut the fuck up and listen for once cause i've been sitting on your shoulder
As you've grown colder
All of these years yelling in your ear
But you wouldn't hear
You had another plan, too big for little me
Let me put it in a rap simile
You'll understand, I gave you a fair shake
Kind of like a ferris wheel, during a earthquake
Get it? like you did it when you had it couldn't get it locked down
No dont bother with a frown
You were healthy in the mental
Potential with the pencil
Could've just filled in the stencil
But you're tempted by the devil
Content to just to settle get a bronze medal
You laid your picnic in the wrong meadow
Cause now you're trembling and mumbling defending what you've done to him you took the low road, there's a toll booth coming! and guess whose in the booth? man, not I
It's the one that the burglars are meeting when they die
And the murders and neighborhood circlers guy
It's not a piece of cake if you want a piece of the pie
So I'll have dinner with the winners
While you simmer with the sinners
Turn your summers into winters
What a bummer you can whimper
You could've been a star just a glimmer
Now let me blow your candle out and make it dimmer

Chorus

Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation we are here today to celebrate the loss of a demon, Peter Sparker
And may he never live again a scourge on this earth may our children never repeat his mistakes (hallelujah)
And may he burn eternally

What do you want me to do? you fucking sorry excuse you dug your own hole lying and dude
No, no, no, that apology is cute
But all will be through
I'll blow your candle like the chances you blew
Yea, you had some moments in the radiance
But then you'd always go skulking in the shade again
You disappointed your family shamed friends
I got a list heres the order of my list that it's in
It goes your daughter, your mother, your girl, your brother, jeff, cam, matt, your father, sister, and some others
So while you wither like Bill your little life will be forgotten while you're rotting wikipedia pages
They will be fading
While you're waiting
For a pardon from this run-on sentence unpunctuated arson while you stand there
Bare your closet full of skeletons dancing like the flames on your hair
Hey, don't be lachrymose, Spose, you're your own foes make this bed of coals you can go and sleep there

Chorus[Verse 1: Spose]
In handcuffs smoking her second butt
Thinking bout her life and how he messed it up, f'd it up
Her maiden name was Jen Kimbal
That was back when she was single
She doesn't still live with her husband of course
They don't grasp the same forks didn't have to divorce
He was getting shady with a lady from work
She saw em coppin' pork, shoppin', poppin' corks
One night he walked in the door with a snort
"Give me food, Jen, then let me watch sports
I want a BJ first like Bjork
Bring a beer in here, dear, from the porch"
She stirred the ladle in the borscht
Said "Yes, Robert" and brought him the main course
He took a spoonful soon was a corpse
She dumped him in the port with the fish by the wharf
She told her cellmate his dick's like a dwarf
But she missed her kiddos
And she's not glad she did it as she's sitting in prison
When they visit they see the widow through the window but

[Hook: Spose and Kristina]
Everybody knew his name
Jacuzzis were his claim to fame
And you would probably do the same
If he did it to you
His name was: Bob Johnson the hot tub king
He's your man if you need anything
If you need that jacuzzi installed
Bob's the man you call (x3)

[Verse 2: Spose]
Yo, Ella was looking for a fella
So she flirted at work
And made their wives all jealous (yeah)
Looking for a man with some loot
Cause her three sons all had holes in the boots (yeah)
Her husband died in Tikrit
Got cash from the government enough to eat
Couldn't even bring her sons to the movies
She took a second job, working selling jacuzzis
Her boss was a pervert, but he's rich like sherbert
He'd get a boner when she'd murmur
So she did it, let him hit it
And then quit her other job as a server
Became the top earner
He was 60 with a 20 year old's sex drive, sex drive
Never thought he would get murdered
After he copped her the 2013 x5, x5
Manicured, no cuticles
Beamer gleaming all looking beautiful
She wore all Gucci to the funeral
Before his wife got life in the cubicle but

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spose]
Well it was just procedure and nobody stuck around
The parking lot was empty 'fore he's in the ground
And his obituary has compliments
As if he did it all with no consequence
He had saliva on his epitaph
But they did not write that because


[Hook]Yo, I woke your man up
Broke your band up
Im the last act playin at the dope-a-rama

Smoke and mirrors, coke and hammers
Little kids get raped
Here to okla-bama[?]

Cure for cancer, cure for aids
You know they got that shit locked away
They’ll give it to you, man, just not today
Pharmaceutical companies say you got to pay

So pull your pants up, do the rock away
Don’t think about how it operates
Behind the scenes, behind the curtains
Catholic priest, anal sex with virgins

Who owns the government gets the permit
God’s online with a texting sermon
For Rex[?] and Herman and the Czechs and Germans
These are just diversions from the Texas earnings

Every time they make a bomb you know they’re getting paid (Bang bang!)
Let me sell you fear cuz' money’s made when you’re afraid

News cast flash with a mass of fascists
Smash glass bass[?] pass Damascus
Conquest bomb test cats distracted
By the wildin’ Mileys and their lack of asses

Pack a back-a-woods sarin black as ashes
New styles futile back to rappin’
They own their earth with their gas and frackin'
And they’re laughin’ at us, Galafinakas

The deeper you dig, the more dirt you’ll find
That’s why I don’t use a shovel here most of the time

[Hook] x4
Don’t pull your thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Syria[Hook]
Came in the game with a brain, not a chain
Went against the grain, left Maine on a plane
Sunny days came and I made it through the rain
Proclaimed I wouldn't tame until the day they know my motherfucking-
Came in the game with a brain, not a chain
Sunny days came and I made it through the rain
Went against the grain, left Maine on a plane
Proclaimed I wouldn't tame until the day they know my motherfucking name!

[Verse 1: Spose]
I was the broseph looking toasted like a pop-tart,
Slumming in a sox hat
Who had turned in a pop star
Whoops!
Kept a couple thousand in the sock drawer
Lit up like a cop car
Smoked it all, bought more
Look
Now I've been preposterously dank
Ridiculously dope
Maybe monstrously lame
But meticulously flow!
Come and get a whiff of Spose;
Smells like Wells, Maine!
Nights up in the cove
I'm not a fighter
Just a writer
Put the lighter to the bowl!

[Verse 2: Spose]
I always knew that it was do or die
I'm doing work while you're hanging like a suicide
I just Googled the meaning of annuitize
Which stupid guys' rhymes you bumped in lieu of mine?!
Who am I?
Spose, motherfucker!
P-DANK to the top like a fat kid to supper!
So tell your brother's mother
Ain't shit, chain's same, it's the fame still;
Sexy as John McCain,
Since I-

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spose]
Fuck your Beemer-Benzer-Bentley!
We'll be smashing in the fender
Take a blender to your Fendi
Yelling obscenities in the mezzanine
P-DANK!
Defenders of the peasantry
Who surprised pleasantly
Guys who thought rap was crack cats and Hennesse
So yeah, Betheny, you can put your ass away

[Verse 4: Spose]
Quick like Nestle
I acquired accolades
Stripes like a referee
I earned 'em cause I had to say what I really had instead of brags
They're yelling
"No you're not, dude don't lie!"
When I pass!
7 million Youtube views in the bag
Cop had me stopped just to get my autograph
But they still don't respect me;
I'm as sexy as a scab
You could prabble for the models
You could wallow for the cash
Fuck that;
Learn facts 'till you need a bigger hat!
So, yeah
Man, we're not the same;
If you're unbejewled then tell your mom
P-DANK!
So we-

[Hook]

[Cam Groves]
You know it's Groves
The flow's so tight
Shout-out to Spose
Man I owe him my life

And I remember back when
He told me keep rappin'
Look at all that happened
Since "John Madden"

In Salt Lake when he signed the deal
Then I packed my bags got behind the wheel
Hear my tires squeal and away we go
On the way home who's on the radio?

(Spose: Mother fucker I'm awesome)

Welcome to the music life
With the Jet Blue flights
And on the news at night

When it comes to picking cards
Gotta choose 'em right
'Cuz this music life
Is an amusement ride

Ever since a kid, yo
The flows were mean

Big dreams whenever me and Spose convened
We were clawing on our way to expose a scene
And now we're on the road, two shows a week
Or we sit in the studio, roll that weed
And write to a beat 'til I go to sleep

It's the M to the A to the I-N-E
More pine trees further than that I can see
Yeah

I'm that rap guy coming through your Cat-5
P-DANK baby, triple clap when we slap five
Remember back when rap was a pastime?
Now we pack heads every time we rap live

Late night writin' down a song
Got the proudest mom
And the crowd respond(?)

Tryin' to make it large comin' from a small town
P-DANK in the building 'til it falls down

Bitch[Intro]

[Verse 1: Spose]
Give me eight bars, I'll make them fly like a catapult
Because of my locality you think we're incompatible?
That my product would divide the people, mathematical?
You think that it's irrational to try to make it national?
I had the same game plan until I came into bigger checks
Same turn-table, same cable, same internet
Same cigarettes, I grab life by the taint
Until townsfolk in Hoboken spoke my name

[Verse 2: Ghost]
But they told me I couldn't get to where I'm trying to go
From the state of trees, lakes, ice fishing and snow
Bucks and does, double Hemi trucks and roads
Made of dirt, It wouldn't work if you're trying to blow
Well I s'pose you're wrong, because songs are in rotation
Hear Maine rap blazin' on stations across the nation
As long as I'm patient, improving my preparation
It's possible, still the local yuppies they be sayin'

[Hook: Spose]
Are you out of your brain?
Rapping from Maine?
You must be insane!
(Well you can't get there from here)
[Spose]
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You must have lost your mind
I mean those rhymes
They were fine for the time, but you
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You're from the easternmost
Northernmost, bordermost state
You can't be great
(You can't get there from here)

[Verse 3: Cam Groves]
I told them that I rap
They say that I'm absurd
Just because I'm from the burbs
I got to listen to Disturbed?
Do what you want, you got the power
It's your life, I'm from Maine and white
And still hot chowder on the mic
Some real and some fake
Too humblay for gunplay
I pay for the studio
And do it all in one take
One day, they told me
Don't quit your day job
Now I'm laughing
Being different finally paid off

[Verse 4: Lady Essence]
No matter if it's supreme
Its a genius within my region
If the M to the E gives reason not to believe it
See I'm seasoning the season
Winter, splinters to bleeding
My image splitting your teeth
Because I got more than like three men
And even though I got this moxie sound
Y'all look at me crookedly because
I work at a lobster pound
Watch it now, my pockets round
But lobster bins still by the pound
But still I keep more iller
Came and keyed you before you locked it down

[Hook: Spose]
Are you out of your brain?
Rapping from Maine?
You must be insane!
(Well you can't get there from here)
[Spose]
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You must have lost your mind
I mean those rhymes
They were fine for the time, but you
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You're from the easternmost
Northernmost, bordermost state
You can't be great
(You can't get there from here)

[Verse 5: Jay Caron]

We're from the state that resides
At the top of the map
But don't assume that we don't know
The math on doing these tracks
You see, as MC's we push it to a higher degree
Because it is, what we believe
That we were destined to be
So we be doing work, putting in time
Searching online, spitting these lines
And mic rules, we craft and design
To take em places, my energy will never be wasted
Because to get there from here is gonna take a lot of patience

[Verse 6: Spose]

So keep the firewood sparked
Where the moose aren't sparse
If you rap like Spose
Well I guess that's a start
Then sell out the bar
If you want to get far
And then help the DJ
Go put the tables in the car
Yeah I'm coming for the title now
Whiter than a bridle gown
I'm from the state of Maine
I can spell it, you should write it down
Roads one lane, streets no lights
I spit hot shit just to stay warm on cold nights

[Hook: Spose]
Are you out of your brain?
Rapping from Maine?
You must be insane!
(Well you can't get there from here)

[Outro]Grab the weed I got a story to tell
A couple years ago, It was Christmas night back in my home town Wells
The snow fall, about an inch an hour
And on the road just our pickup truck, snow plows
After familial obligations
Me and my man Phil met up to start blazin'
Around 8 sparked the back woods, on the back road, the wind chill blew the snow like satchmo
I asked "How was your Christmas?", he said "it sucked."
I asked "Why?", he said,"Man my sister's fucked
And if that slut died tonight it wouldn't be enough"
I asked for an explanation he just took another puff
He handed it to me, I told him "Mine wasn't better."
"I just got a couple corny-ass sweaters
And my family embarrassed me because apparently getting arrested twice in a month is worthy of a parody."
Just then, turned onto Bear's Den, saw a whip with a woman and a kid in it, in a ditch
Volkswagen the color of cocaine
With the front end buried inside a snow bank
Temperatures near zero man, it isn't May
No reception out here to call Triple A
It's safe to say if Phil and I hadn't drove by, this lady and her son could've frozen and died
We put the woods in the ash tray
Stopped the truck, put the gloves on, hopped out of the shit and walked that way
We asked if we could help, she said "Oh, thank God, yes." She looked blazed herself..
Her son shivered in the passenger, wearing a seat belt, he looked to be about 12
We said "No Prob," The son said "You're our guardian angels,"
We laughed and moved the truck at an angle
We hooked the chains up and put her in drive
We had 'em out faster than a first pitch pop fly
It was all thank-yous, and huggin'
Could've sworn I smelled Rum on the breath of the woman
Nonetheless, I gave her son a high-five, said bye hopped up in the truck and drove into the night
Never told anybody about the good deed of the two dudes in hoodies
Wish the story ended there

[Verse 2]

I awoke next morning with the sun
Reflecting off the snow in the yard out front
I felt fine in my flannel sheets
The day after a snow storm tends to bring clarity
And a shit load of shovelin'
I was still living in the home that my mother's in
I pulled the covers off, I felt quite alive as I reached to my phone that I had on silent
Now this was years ago now, but I recall I saw 16 texts, 31 missed calls
I knew something was awry..
I ran downstairs,mom tears in her eyes
And a mouth agape staring at the TV
I said "What happened?", I knew something was creepy
She just pointed at the screen
I walked down next to her to see
And I saw it
"Two dead in a drunk driving crash in Wells
A woman, 22, and a boy age 12
One survivor was in critical condition,"
It was the mother of the boy,they think she had been drinking
The scene on the screen looked grimy
A white Jetta bisected by a pine tree
In the background a green jeep flipped
I put my hand to my mouth and said "Jesus"...
As I recognized the sugar loaf sticker
On the back of the jeep that belonged to Phil's sister
The whole scene flashed blue and red lights
Illuminating Christmas night
My heart sunk like a plane with no wings because I understood the whole thing..
My heart sunk like a plane with no wings.. broken

I mean, what if we had left them in that ditch?
What if we never burn cruised and we were good kids?
What if Phil was a bad dude like everybody thought
Because he sold pot
And we never even stopped to help them?
What if I had questioned that mom?
What if Phil's sister and that boy weren't gone?
What if that right that we did was a wrong?
And what if? and so on and on until the break of dawn..

Just another Christmas song[Intro: Spose]
Yeah, yeah...
Dankonia...
Peter Sparker, Spizzy Spose, Maine Gretzky...
It's the return

[Verse: Spose]
I got no lies in my lyrics
Did coke lines at my parents
No co-signs but the road signs
They Maine(mean) I got my bearings
I got whole milk in my coffee
Bro give me a topic
I'll flip it how they wouldn't think of flipping it
Funny how cats sell copies
I got no fights I been in
Size thirty my denim
Interior cluttered
Exterior dented
Me, I had a major label with a big amount
And I wish that I hadn't spent it now
Went up in smoke, now I'm broke no cash
So I overdraft my check account
Can't afford no reefer
Can't afford no features
They say my name, I used to be in the game
Now I'm sitting up in those bleachers
My wrist still not blinging
Phone still not ringing
Gmail, check forty times a day
But no new messages in it
You wanna know what's even more
My booking agent was Peter Schwartz
He booked Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller
And he slept on me then we divorced
But it's like he never knew me though
Finally told him it was time to go
He said "OK" and he told me that my shit reminds him of Coolio (What?)
Really dude my shit reminds you of Coolio?
Is the alphabet full of numerals?
Did you dudes forget that I'm super dope?
That I'm proven human spewing truly moving shit for the dudes and bros
Up in Maine where it's two below and I don't rap 'bout no groupie hoes
You think my shit sounds like Coolio? (Fuck!)

[Outro: Spose]
Fucking... ten years of lyrical shit...
Three albums two mixtapes...
Dense ass verses and I sound like Coolio...? (C'mon...)And a two and a three

Who rocks the party till the cows come home
And doesn't have cows so he keeps moving on?
It's Peter! (Hey)
You're now rocking with the P-Dank crew tonight
Who rocks the party till the people all die
Then drags all the bodies outside and keeps rocking?
It's Peter! (Hey)
You're now rocking with the P-Dank crew tonight

You're now rocking with the best rapper with a concave chest
To give it to you nonetheless
I got the illest raps in the village, plus the most villains
Have my boulders looking coca-cola since we were some children
I'm the visionary vigilante, of the ante
Kicked over your hill, but you still lacked a Nancy
Buzz-buzz shoo fly, don't bother me
You don't do it properly, don't touch my pottery
Fantastic, you damn bastard
This shit's handcrafted, and it's made in Maine
And I've been at it for a good while, never hood style
And my clique sticks together like it's a wood pile
So pile into the whip
The Virgin Mary has a baby every time I spit
Cause I'm known to rock a party till the cops come
Then I'll open up the door and tell them "we're not done"

(chorus)

You're now rocking with the most freshest, I'll give you no guesses
It's Edgar Allen Poe, plus both s's
That's my fucking name, and my mother's who's to blame
They hear me rap and like "I can't believe he's from Maine!"
She's like "I can't believe it either, I've heard he's Ryan Peters
I knew this kid, he went to college with him sold him reefer
I heard he rocks sneakers that are old, and he lives up in Maine up in the cold
At least that's what I'm told"
"I can confirm it cause I saw him at McDonalds
And his car it had Heineken bottles in it
It was disgusting, his whip was gross
I don't even think I could be down with Spose"
I'm like I don't give a fizzuck, get up off my nizzuts
Everybody put your motherfucking hands izzup
If you don't have hands, then welcome to the show
I've got to ask the question, but you already know

(chorus)

Whack verses lame hooks
And your shit sucks but looks good on Facebook
You can doubt my shit
You can count my money then get off my discography
Bulky like Sam's Club
So great I make a snake put their hands up
Like my man bud, buy my tee-shirt
You'll have your chance little buddy, but it's me first
P-derp, reefer, leader of the people living cheaper
MCs see me go "Jeepers!"
Get jealous, want to beat me up
But these rappers just beneath me like Reese's Cups, sluts[Intro:]
A couple of things that'll bring a dude down, I'll tell ya in a sec
Uh-Spose, OH, SEVEN
Drugs, girls, money, liquor

[Verse 1:]
Check it out, hey, yo, I'm breaking up prescription drugs on Egyptian rugs
Too blazed to be depicted thugs, blunts like "Huh, huh?"
My zip-locks used to be in tip top form, like my hip-hop
'til one morn police swarmed the dorm (god damn!)
One that didn't listen, ignored my inhibition with snorin' but they had warrants so now my parents bitchin'
No tuition because of my drug addiction 'Oh Ryan, you lyin'!', Nah bitch it's non-fiction
These blonds and brunettes are god-damned ruthless
My wallet's Somalian and starvin' it's quite retarded
Girls, you can't take them out like the garbage
When the dinner costs more than the rent for your apartment
They want diamonds, islands, expensive bottles
I'm like "How about the dollar menu, at McDonalds?"
But no girls is on their knees for fries and double G's
Jeez, at least my right hand will fuck me for free!

[Hook:]
What's it all about?
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm (alright)
As long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a fool
If you feel me say (yeah)
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm (alright)
Cause as long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a fool
(SHUT THE FUCK UP!)

[Verse 2:]
Spizzy still unequivocally ill, but no deal
From Wells, like the girl from the ring, but no bling!
No ice like summer, Bank balance a bummer
Call my mom's house, they disconnected my number
I ain't stinkin' rich, but at least I don't stank
Fuck irrational skanks at Ocean National Bank
I'm broke, but still breaking the Garcia figure
Feeding at White Castle or sonic like (SEGA!)
Muchos Cannabis, I'm a blunt analyst
Burritos, Fritos, Cheetos, and a sand-a-wich
I got the munchies, dank smellin' funky
Chunky blunts longer than a candle stick!
Hey, I like herbal shit, Percocet, Vicodin
It's like Heineken after Heineken
I freestyle and rhyme again
Also I'm drunk, trying to find shrooms
And this slam-pic is starting to look like Heidi Klum

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
And now it's 4 A.M., bag with stems
No honeys, mo money
And this liquor got me feeling crummy
Hug me
In a secluded room, or smokin' Buddha
Thrice times wooted, find me where the food is
Or-or, studderin' and pukin' shit up
Like the second half of 2 girls 1 cup
Yep, demented exes, or pimpin' sluts
Cause I'm drunk like WHAAA-I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
I'll be wilin', drunk dialin', freestylin'
Zoned out, rockin' closed eye-a-lids
Me? I get higher when
I be smokin' out the piece
Like I'm preached on violins
This liquor kicks into my liver
But fuck that, where the drugs at?
Spizzy uninhibited drinker
Girl, you never find Ryan lyin' on the mic
But you might find Ryan high lyin' on the dike

[Hook]

[Outro:]
(yeah)x4
Who got-who got smoke-
(yeah)x4
Who got-who got smoke-
(yeah)x4
Who got-who got smoke-
(yeah)x4[Intro]

[Verse]

Stand still like a statue, snowflake tattoo
Fast Food Pabst Blue Cam Groves that's who
I rap dude, got the cashews to back it up
Slim pickings, been spitting like I'm Daffy Duck
Call me old fashion, going go get my crap done
I'm half gone, trying to write a rap song
Got a good buzz and I'm hoping that it lasts long
Picturing your sister strap on-ing with your fat mom
Dagone I just did it again kid, offensive, ah shit look what my pen did
I write rhymes that will strain your brain and that'll move crowds like a bus, plane, or train
Dang, Wells, Maine this fly, baby why, cuz I've been live since I arrived in '85
Not a ladies guy, girl I'm not a heart-throb and even though they call it giving brain it ain't a smart job

[Outro][Verse 1]
I'm waking up with "Whiz Wit'" stains on the hoodie every Philly morning
Touring, my desire to aspire higher still enormous
The chronic got me gone on comets so I'm still in orbit
Stand tall in the squall never balled like Billy Corgan
I smash it in my demographic so I'm still important
(Who? 12 year olds?)
I bring 'em in young, you silly Morman
Rappers Jekyll and Hyde, minus the Jekyll part
Steppin' in the session with preferable repertoire
They wanna skirmish, leave em feelin' squeamish
Turn it like a furnace leave 'em feeling like a fetus
Eric, I'm just being earnest: if you're scheming on an Edith
Fronting on my epidermis you should listen to the edict
Man, you're meager and weak
I want your femur to leak
I'm fuckin' evil with beats
Call me Peter the Sheikh
I need peeps to delete
I'm eager to beast
It's the return! Luckily I keep the receipt right there in the fuckin' L.L. Bean Dune Grass Camos
Aroma Joe's stains on the kneecaps, fresh raps! Peter Sparker!

[Verse 2]
This is the sequel to the prequel of my feature it's sweet
You're Facebookin' shook and lookin' for your beeper to beep
It's odd addition you've written you think you're equal to me
You should speak your piece in brief and bring some reefer to me
Wiz Khalifa Queen Latifah money: get it with my clever mouth
Keep pushing get the repercussions like devil's couch
I'm a nice dude you should quit the talking back
Get dropped like ice cubes in the Johnnie Walker Black
Wells, Maine reppin' it
Babble never dabble in the decadence
Never spent a shekel on a necklace
Jargon in the margin of the parchment is a definite
Yard got horseflies, I've never seen a Pegasus
Tomato juice type on the flight that's the preference
Had a blast in class regardless what the lesson is
"I'm Awesome," that song was lame, huh?
I'd make fun of your songs but nobody could name one, punk[Intro]
Uh oh oh hey I didn't see you there
Welcome to sunny Wells, Maine
Pass me the blunt
(yeah I got a boner, bitch)

[Verse 1]
Back when I was sipping Sunny D
Watching "Harry and the Hendersons"
Oshkosh jeans, and the Dimetapp medicine
Life was good and oh so simple
No girls, no weed, no police, no pimples
And now it's red stripe 'til I can't stand up
I dont bluff, I'm in Maine like horse dandruff
I could burn my mouth and still not suck
With the bank account negative a million bucks
And even when I'm drunk I spit resilient stuff
And I date a Kennebunker who gives brilliant fucks
Similarly early life made me as such
Heyo what? I've been bonkers since Tonka trucks
Is he spizzy? is he nuts? the locals are unsure
No fur, just ash stains on the sweatshirt
Who besides Spose had a flow so pure
Before the Red Sox reversed that curse in '04 say

[Chorus]
Fuck it
If you're with me or you just got meds for your STDs say
Fuck it
One life to live and one million more nose rips to give say
Fuck it
If you ain't got paid or you ain't got laid in one hundred days say
Fuck it
Spizzy Spose You're damn right I keep it bimpin

[Verse 2]
White dude, nikes
Suburban living where the blunts half-pipes be
Quite abundant night life unlively
Glove compartment got febreeze and visene
VCR-TV combo not widescreen
And Mike V hustles trees unidly
12 year olds fake ID's
Rich dads keep their yards tidy
Shall I proceed? (mmhmm) Alrighty
We got wealth disproportionate
Teen suicide, no need for Kevorkian
Dope people mixed with should've been abortioned kids
Wells, Maine from the casket to the orphanage
And back again, I'm from the place where the wives scream
Redneck fists aren't soft like Ice Cream
Police lights shine bright white
Everynight like, Jesus Christ light beams
And the radio sucks, so turn up the Outkast

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've been dope with these rants
Since everybody rocked JNCO pants
Justin, JC, and Lance used to blare
At every Junior High Dance
While my mom was in the basement watering plants
With the xenon lights, rural life ain't polite
Welcome to the jungle stash the weed by the grundle
My buddy mumbles that the cop probably knows his uncle
Get it dropped like a fumble
I said, "that shit's bimpin"
5'8" eyes dilate when I'm baked
Guidos in tuxedos buy steaks at high rates
For Christ sake, American parents are irate
Cause they've all seen their daughters gyrate on myspace
I'm on the couch, passed out
Being an ass clown
But they say that Spose kid
Is dope with his mouth
In fact the illest illestest since social studies syllabus
Before islamic militants were killing us

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Can't afford a hat, I wear a bucket
Kicked out my mom's house, fuck it
On the mic i used to sucking reluctant
But not no more
Fucked a lot of girls,but not no whores
Freestyle, used to kick it F4
I can kick it up in my moms door
At my dad's house, i got a bad mouth
From the Wells, Maine area
Sicker than malaria
Cause mass hysteria in your area
Fucking coming out your stereo
When you're bumpin
I mean something like that, bimpin

[P Nut's "TJ Quit" voicemail][Intro]
Welcome back to sunny Wells, Maine

[Verse 1]
Guess who's back off the couch
Got the panties in a drought
Duct taping Casey Anthony's mouth
It's Mr. "no you're not dude"
Back with some hot new raps
For these kindergarteners to smoke pot to
This shit's changed since I came into the cypher
Because everyone was agro
Now they're all nicer
Pants used to sag low
Now they're all tighter
And the black dudes who rhyme are named Wayne and Tyler
Huh, we must've smoked something funky
Somewhere back there and we all go the munchies
Ate Hershey's Cookies and Cream and got clumsy
Cause there's white rappers everywhere and nobody's hungry
You used to have to pay dues
They pay dudes
To get YouTube views
While they play beirut
Enabling fake crews
To take spots
I heard Sam Adams and it made me miss Aesop Rock
Yeah the one-hit wonder guy who raps is back
To make your thunder thighs giggle if your ass is fat
With some fact packed anglo-saxon backpacked tracks
My dishwasher's got racks on racks

[Chorus]
I got 'em like gee willikers, fuck that shit
I bet he doesn't know any black kids
I got 'em like gee golly man what a shit show
I knew I hated Spose from the get-go
Gee willikers, I know I can't lose
Making rap songs that these strippers can't dance to
Gee golly I'm the same old cat I, I, I, I keep it bimpin'

[Verse 2]
What's up? I'm Spose if you didn't know
The representative of people who got little dough
And I never spit a rhyme trying to get a ho
I'm not trying to put the big 'L' in Deuce Bigalow
Nor am I trying to be the hardest dude
Or act like it's all good bro no barbecues
A grimy, major label signed me
To a situation hairy as vaginas in the 90's
Find me back in Maine cacklin'
Still got weed like 'we would' as a contraction
I still sip ship yards pigs lingerin'
Spit bars back woods in my fingerprints
Some couplets I come up with seem funny
Other pairs are hair raising like I breed bunnies
I'm still ungroomed, I'm back in the flesh
I spit it raw, unbridled like a bachelorette
Check it I know that the folks don't listen
Dissing - though other bros don't spit efficient
Broke - had the soap, did dishes in kitchens
Hooks and 'allure' like this is fishing
I'm banking on taking the bacon and making a run for the gold
I been mistakenly taken for humorous
They been been assuming I'm making a joke like...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Chord change!
You're now rocking with the town folks spokesman
Who girls think is too short but I'm not from Oakland
And it's been years since I deposited tokens
But I've been in the game getting bread, you're just loafin'
This is the voice of the villagers not sitting back scared to act whispering
"gee willikers" nah, this is an uprising
Dudes are just rhyming
I've fantasized about this when I was just Ryan
Come kick it with the aged liquor, sipper, slipper, rocker
Picked the pocket of a major label, knicker bocker
Sagging, keep my circle tighter than some leather pants
Whole state behind me like a weather man, damn

[Chorus]Yeah Spose

Everytime Spose and a beat colesce it is no less than sick nasty grotesque
Disgusting rhyme-busting twenty-something
Dude who gets booty like a pirate chest
So gobble a dank if you don't like him
Cause lyrically he rape a beat like a viking
Flow so honed, hot as your blood
Cool as snow cones, what it's all good
Quite suburban he's not at all hood
Not country just the woods so fuck Keith Urban
I've wrapped tight and over your head
Like a turban since you nerds left turds in the bed
I'm absurd with words emerged in burned threads
X2

We need more beats

Like a phoenix from the art of emceeing left dead
My friends jock dreads and play death metal
In Maine where they mount fox heads from the meadow on the wall
I'm off the wall, Michael Jackson
Maxing at Federal Jacks with something attractive
I'm a cactus with this rap shit (Spose)
Never resort to wack tactics (no)
Jaw-dropped reactions when I'm rapping (so)
Fly it's making me high like Toni Braxton
Mr. Spizzy is now teaching classes
So throw away all your busy-work packets
Decidedly un-ghetto rhyme fello
Who listens to Sublime from time-to-time
Hello it's Spizzle
They're miserable I exist
They're pissed but this rhyming mindless drivel can't persist
My flow's A-list, your flow is gayness
I think you get the gist so liten up kids
I'll be at 15 chester, weed on the dresser
I'm clever but slept on like lunesta
Peace
Who in the fuck is this dashing boy?
Who raps religiously like Pastor Troy?
Spizzy Spose is fly like asteroids?
Lyrically he's passed your boys
But where's he from? Wells, Maine
Got a lot of dollars in my wallet nah im broke
Not a baller marijuana is the product i promote
I hope people see i'm ghoulish in the face
So, they understand when I'm caught staring into space
Fly like McLaren, high like a parrot
Coughing so hard looking like i'm in hysterics
Known amongst Jareds and Dereks as the rarest
Rapper staring at your weed asking you to share it
Like Napster, Mainers jock tractors
Hold up... Rest in peace Ol' Dirty Bastard
Ol' Dirty Curtis came back from the grave
Pussies got AIDs, walking like zombies
Broken Motorolla roll of quarters for the laundry
Smoked up sitting there looking like Ghandi
Stiky-1 leather jacket looking like Fonzi
Deep in thought, creeping like the cops
Heineken bottle pops and no models give me props
Rarely touch supple couple cupped tittied city sluts
Keep it York County, what up townies
Lifted all the time like Canadian mounties
Gobble a dank, baby, Spizzy Spose if you need him and if you don't
Preposterously Dank
Wells, Maine
0-4-0-9-0
In pussies like gyno
Old school like dino with the rhyme flow
It's all good
What it does
Sorry to beat ya rappers
Meet me at the Wells House of Pizza after
Preposterously dank the album, We smoked it All mixtapes 1 through 649 coming soon
Spizzy Spose
Keep it bimpin
