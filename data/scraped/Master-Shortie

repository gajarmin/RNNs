[Hook: XO Man]
I'm from a place people stop and stare
Carry small dogs and make what they wear
Cameras Flashing, Champagne Splashing, Money Dashing
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

Follow Fashion, Follow Follow Fashion
Follow Fashion, (Come, come come) Follow Fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

[Verse 1: Mikill pane]
Ever since XO called on me like Eric Prydz to tear this shit
To many bits
I've been asking myself will they think of me as a trendy prick
In a pair of chinos and expensive kicks
Fixed gear bike doing lengthy skids
Peddling around, representing kids that are doing strictly independent bizz-ness
Is-this
Viewed as a life full of slick pretences
Well you cunts really should look deeper
You should have my prescription lenses
That I wear
Better still, get yourself some of that eyewear
Then Stand right there
I bet you'd still, get the impression that i'd care
I know that if I don't really show my emotions to such fools then I can't get hurt
But there's hardly a need for a heart on my sleeve, this is such a cool Benjart sweatshirt
So the only heart you'll see is on my chest right where the S should be
And your girlfriends also hate my style that explains why they're undressing me

Follow Fashion, Follow Follow Fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

[Verse 2: XO Man]
I consume any room I'm in
Before anyone hears me rhyming
Too tall so forget climbing
Repeat after me Simon (Ayooo)
As I walk into the room it (Froze)
To see a 6"10 man wearing
Oh my god where diddy diddy diddy (uh) where did he get them clothes
Hair in two, runaway tache (Amazing)
??????????? with a rhyming gift that sounds (Amazing)
More style than a G G magazine, pitbull holler at me I'm (Amazing)
6"10 presence of big ben, tourists flash your cameras cos I'm (Amazing)
I've been covered in tweed from 1.5 plus a 10 bag of weed (Pause)
I've been dressing as fly from Simpsons days no Family Guy
Fly Co-D fontzerelli
Check Check Check me on your tele
Flashing a six pack no belly
???????? Yo Kenny

[Verse 3: Master Shortie]
They said it's impossible for me to rep the UK
Because of the way that I dress, yes, they say that I'm gay?
But i've been taking all of your chicks since like 03
So whilst you niggas are into beef
Me, I'm collecting poultry
Never smoking, never choking on this new new
I'm the shit so there ain't nothing I can't Do Do
Looking in my face saying I can't rap star
Now you're into skinny jeans, Snapbacks and Trapstarr
I'm a star that traps, in a solar system
Record Labels are pissed because they fucking missed em
Chicks think I'm hot, niggas say I'm cool
Regardless it's going down, Berlin Wall
And I don't really care, comfortable
Got so much drive, I'll never stall(CHORUS)
I GOT A ROPE CHAIN
YOU GOT A ROPE CHAIN
WE GOT A ROPE CHAIN
YEEEEMAN
I KEEP IT OLD SCHOOL
YOU KEEP IT OLD SCHOOL ?
I KEEP IT OLD SCHOOL
YEEEEMAN
I'M REPPIN LONDON CITY
YOU REPPIN LONDON CITY ?
I'M REPPIN LONDON CITY
YEEEEMAN
MY NAME IS MASTER SHORTIE
YOU KNOW ABOUT MASTER SHORTIE
I KNOW BOUT MASTER SHORTIE
YEEEEMAN
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE MY TIME
WHERE YOUTHS LIKE THEIR BEEF AND THEY GRIME
AND PREPARED TO DRAW FOR THE NINE
IF YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME
BUT I'M NOT LIKE THEM GUYS
I HAD TO OPEN MY EYES
SO I COULD PREVAIL, AND I COULD EXCEL
MAKE MY MUSIC SO IT SELLS
MY INSPIRATION COMES FROM GOD
SO I'M GRATEFUL
LOOK AT THE WAY I'M SPITTING IT DOWN
LIKE IT'S BLOODY APRIL
I'M THAT GOOD GUY
I WALK AROUND WITH A HALO
THE ONLY BANGERS THESE FIGURES
ARE MASHING
ARE SAUSAGE AND POTATO

(CHORUS)
IN MY DREAMS I'M WRAPPED IN PALMS
SOMETIMES IM WRAPPED IN ARMS
ALL MY TUGS AROUND ME
TRUST ME
THEY ROLL WITH STRAPS AND ARMS
WANT ME TO CONVERT
THROW AWAY MY BIBLE AND PSALMS
I'D RATHER DO MY MUSIC
SPEND ALL MY MONEY ON GARMS
THAT'S WHY I LOOK SO SWEET
THAT'S WHY I KEEP SO NEAT
THEY SAY THAT I'M A GYALIST
I KNOW ALL THEM FREAKS
BUT IM SURRONDED BY TUGS
MAKE SURE IT'S NOT FORGOTTEN
I'VE GOT THE HOOD ON MY BACK AND TRUST ME
WE AIN'T MADE OF COTTON

(CHORUS)
AND WHEN THE ROPE CHAIN SWINGS
THE GIRLS GRIN, THEY LIKE
HI, MY NAME, I'M ON ANYTHING
THEY CALL ME KASE
OTHERWISE MR BENJAMIN
I'M LIKE A SCAR
ON THE SKIN I WON'T FADE IN
THE NAME KASE BUT
CALL ME AMAZING
FIRST TIME PLACED IN
NAH I AIN'T CHANGING
AND MY SWAG'S CORRECT
WATCH THE WAY I MOVE
AND THE ROPE CHAIN
SWINGS ON MY NECK YEP
