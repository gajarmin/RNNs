[Eazy-E]
This is Eazy motherfuckin' E, coming to you direct from the Penthouse
And we chillin' in this motherfucker
Yo Playa, spit

[Playa Hamm]
Break yourself hoes, you're in the presence of his Mackness
Ruthless/Priority is back with another platinum package
For the suckers who didn't think we was coming just like this
Kiss my ass and watch a troop straight freak your bitch
And get a ho back with a mack smooth controlling the mind
And the body, be giving up the pussy a party
See busta-ass niggas getting paid, but it ain't shit though
Yeah you punk motherfuckers doing low but yo
Witness a mack with strong back attack with no pity
Getting fat off your bitch's titty
Los Angeles Players of the Penthouse are worldwide
Run but you can't hide, check your girl I'm sure to slide
Run up and between and get a ho cause she's been asking for
Don't disrespect us, ??? she'll come back for more
Never underestimate the power of a young troop
Checking a fat grip and ain't on no head trip
With suckers on the nut sack hanging from the hairs
And bitches on the dick like my BVD underwear
For a freak ain't jocking for any reason, so what?
I'm a still hit some guts, get a nut, and a some cuts, sluta

[Eazy-E]
If you do nothing, say nothing, you'll never be nothing
And there's a sucker born every motherfuckin' minute
Yo Quik, kick that shit

[DJ Quik]
Now the suckers take a licking like a Timex
Cause I'm a troop and I'm rolling like a Rolex
And I'm your host with the most, Mr. Quik, Eazy-E
(And the P-E-N-T-H-O-U-S-E) with something bumping for your stereo
But sucker-ass niggas don't hear me though
But funky is the password to make them fear me, though
Cause I'm platinum-bound with that west coast sound
And if you want to get down I got 17 rounds
Claiming you peel caps, nigga I pull naps
Of the next of the saps with that wack-ass cap
Like these South Bronx niggas, starving like rats
With songs more corny than Yo! MTV Raps
How would you figure that a nigga like the Quik would show you slack?
I'd rather put a fucking shank in your back
Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll fuck your moms at gunpoint
Off of Genuine Draft and a bud joint
So if you're looking in The Source magazine and don't see me
It's cause the fucking East Coast is the enemy
But I got something that'll serve you right
Nighty night motherfuckers (gunshot), sleep tight

[Eazy-E]
Here comes another Penthouse Player, stepping on toes
Tweed Cadillac out for the money, the mic, and the hoes
Fade 'em my skinhead nigga

[Tweed]
Now I'm a ??? for sharp clothing and pose and be chosen
I'll rock the mic, the stage, the party, and the hoes and
Rolling suckers up in a zag like a spliff
Smoking 'em, like a new pimp cigarette
It's been said that I'm a get fucked
Or get fucked standing straight up
It's something bout your face, make me want to slap it
Something bout your eye, make me want to black it
Call me "Earl Shibe," I'll dip you alive
Spraypaint your posse for $99.95
The track stainless, the record of Tweed
Don't confuse me, for your bitch or your homey
Yeah I'm talking shit, only God can kill me
Your rhymes don't thrill me, suck my sweet dick, Willy
Yo, Larry Parker, where's my 3 million?
I want a bus in ninet deuce fill in
The P the P the C, pimp or die low
Shake it up baby, it's coming back dope
I ain't from Compton, I dwell in Los Angeles
Heart of California, land of the scandalous

[Eazy-E]
Now there you have it, Penthouse, true motherfuckin' players
Kicking that pimp shit for '92
And if you don't like it, fuck you[Playa Hamm]
The P, a playa, a pimp, so add some paper
All combined to give these others the vapors
Now I'm a try and refrain from getting deep like I always do
But if I deepen it's the depth I'm true
But like I said I ain't, yet I'm a still paint a picture
Of a playa, jumping sucker rhyme sayers
Never giving a clue to how I do what I do
But if a sucker was true, he'd be a player, too
It's mind over matter, and babe it don't matter
So when you knock a new one, let your pockets get fatter
A player's style is this one, and if I don't diss one
Sucker in this rhyme, I'm a diss by the thousands
To quote David G, "Used to be is like never was"
If I ain't your blood, then I ain't your cuz
How can I drop any lesser than my predecessor?
The rhymes I blow I blow, cause they don't know

"They don't know what I know" (Repeat 2x)

[Playa Hamm]
How to blow and throw and grow, as I flow and
Keep it simple, a playa rhyme is a temple
Save it for the true players, staying like that
So stay true and you too can get fat
Like I do, don't cheat yourself
Trueness keeps you in good health, so treat yourself
What I mean is fakers are a dime a dozen
Yeah you though he was true girl, but he wasn't
As true as I am, the one and only Playa Hamm
Comes this way man, and the suckers say "Damn that's dope!"
They ain't got much hope
Don't really know, they can't cope
I am the soap and the water, suckers need bathing
The purity of Penthouse, they ain't fading
Trying for years and years, what to do in 30 minutes
Cause I see all up in it
I'm a legend in your life

"They don't know what I know" (Repeat 2x)

[Playa Hamm]
I learned a lession bout fessin', proing and not conning
That's why I'm real, busting rhymes beyond any
Sucker tearing shit off, Penthouse ain't soft
But hardcore and a whole hell of a lot more
Quik beats to play with, dance and romance to
Playa rhymes to play, when slapped, take a chance to
Fade a true playa, might wimp when I freak
I keep coming, fading you is like slumming
This is a necessity, consider it prophecy
The coming of a savior here to S-A-V-E
Suckers, from a fate worse than death
The state of being suckers, but for some it's too late
I create rhymes others onlt wish they had
Cause I'm a tad bit better, and much more ingeneous
Sometimes I wish I said what a sucker says
Cause his cap, but suckers luck but
My rap ain't for everyone cause I diss
Yeah I'm concieted, in this game you need it
I won't bow down for props I must drop for
A few, cause a few are true to their game

"They don't know what I know" (Repeat 2x)(DJ Quik)
Yes I'm too smart to get dicked, ah so the case may be
That's how the ho felt when she found out that she couldn't play me
I know the game and I know it rather swell too
Rubbin up on my dick and given me hints that you interested
You figgure first kiss my lips and rub my hips then you take a sip
Of Hennesy hit the budda pass out and i'll take the strip
Hell naw monkey mouth trick, ya stupid ho
You must be a fool if you thinkin that I don't know
But naw you broke ass hoes be tryna come up, shakin that money maker
But I brake her cuz the bitch is a faker
Or maybe she just don't know the formula, of how to get rich quik
Without havin to make happy dick
That all a bitch know, is how to be a mega ho
I guess it just goes to show that shes to ignorant to know
That I won't be played, or ganked or gaffled but I ain't perfect
I woop the dick out every know and then and let em slurp it
But I'm careful bein aware of the bitches
That's chargining niggas on purpose cuz they think they deserve it
Yeah that's some cold shit, my experince oughtta learn ya
That if a nigga ain't tryna smoke ya a bitch tryna burn ya, so trust no

(DJ Quik: chrous x2) *mixing, mixes*
Trust no bitch, punk bitches
Trust no (ho) funky cock hoes

(Playa Hamm)
I refuse to loose so I choose few and trust none
See my ladies I love, but to you bitches I ain't the one
When I tell you to trust no bitch, it might not occur to you
Females ain't the only bitches that I'm reffering to
See you can't help a bitch, let alone treat swell a bitch
Cuz a bitch sold out, gone sell out or the bitch gone snitch
Bitches wanna be & always go be around
Watching what you do, tryna use you and keep you down
Playa Hamm ain't gone boil with a story you got ya own
I'mma strength in your condition to get a dogg a bone
And move own till a muthaphukka fake you, fuck you
And make you take they punk bitch ass to the bank fool
See bitches get paid, see bitches got charm
I see em all at the mall, on tv & on my homies arm
See some of my homies got bitches, but we breakin bitches homie
So I come like this bitch, act like you know

(DJ Quik: chrous x2)

(Eazy-E)
Eazy-E the muthaphukkin manipulator, when it comes to pussy holes
Just watch how my dick grows
But since all hoes fall in the bitch catagory
Trustin no hooker ass bitches its mandatory
How much do you you want bitch, how much can you take
Cuz a nigga like tha E you can't brake
With that skinny little ass in my face and i'll slap it
Whip out my dick and let you lick before I tap it
My left hands on your ass, my right hands on your head
Cuz bitches get the nut and niggas get the led
Suckin my dick, lickin my balls you make me come faster
Suckin my toes, lickin my ass you know you are the master
Now you just won't stop
Suckin everybody's dick cuz it's good till the last drop
But that shit won't phase me
I trust no car wreckin bitch, this ones for you tracey
(beeiotch echo)

(DJ Quik: chrous x4)

(AMG)
Pussy ain't nuthin but a ho that at nine do
So i'd rather make a mil while I'm sippin' a cold brew
Bitches ain't shit, word to the diggy diggy dick
Eazy-E, PPC, AMG & Quik
Bitch I ain't +Babyface+ so save ya +Whip Appeal+
I never go on dates with broke bitches get free meals
I'm supposed to pay the way to lucrative panty deals
Bitch please you betta hit the knees, or you can even youch ya toes
Cuz I'm still playin ya'll punk hoes like dominoes
And if you suck the dick right and the pussys tight
I might not beat you down until the second night
Once a dog always a dog bitch
You little trick, tramp, slut with the big butt
Cuz you ain't shit bitch
I'd rather fuck you than love you
Bitch I never trust ya

(DJ Quik: chrous x4)

(Eazy-E)
And like I said before, all bitches ain't shit (echoes)[Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, you ain't my woman no more
I gave you a chance, I got bitches out there hoeing for
A real nigga, sharing his world and his fat checks
Now your ass ??? complaining while I'm chilling with them hoes next
The different when I rip, or the one I want to get with
Baby tripping, I'm dismissing a ho for the next bitch
I'm rolling, like Kane in control, I navigate
Step to me, you respect me, must I reiterate?
You can't check me, I ain't that brother you're used to
Fade in the brain with that ??? attitude
Just because you got Papa Boo and the nuts I rest in
I ain't that nigga you can freak and be testing
Any questions? Yeah I can be a gentle man
But I'm a G baby, you can't get bent but I can
I want a real woman, not a groupie or a nut ho
You can't check me, things ain't like the folks

[Tweed]
Oh yeah, ring around the hoes, and that's just how the story goes
And Playa Hamm out there stepping on toes
They puts 'em up their nose
But that's a whole nother episode

[Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, you need to sit back and observe this
And I don't give a fuck if I get on your nerves, bitch
Cause I'm living good, and you want what you can't have
Some you took for granted, so now you feel the wrath
For the half and hot laugh, I know you want a cut
I wouldn't give you the pleasure of tasting my nuts
I'd rather jack off (Bitch!) And serve it to the curb
Than give you any type of action like that you little birds
So now you get served, I know you homeboys is shocked
I bet you had them bitches thinking you still had me locked
But not the Playa Hamm, playing no favorites
Taking no prisoners, and I say baby I'm with this on hock
Is she in it to win it? She can't lose, you need naw ass
I draw the line, baby gon' bump it or go out with the trash
We got an understanding, and my true is gon' affect this
Already knew like you know now, you can't check me

[Tweed]
Aw yeah, either shit or get off the pot
And if you can't let ??? rock
Park your crab extention nails down the block
And take that busta-ass nigga with ya

[Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, sucka fall in, take your place
Cause we don't just eliminate boy, we erase
No trace of your purpotrating ass will they find
No clues, no witnesses, no body, no crime
My family and I are compelled to this realness
Sword to uphold PPC and its chillness
Yeah, I'm that nigga, that gravedigga figure
Take a sucker good care, I ain't have to pull the trigger
You'd better recognize what you're up against and blend in
My brothers already want your head in the den
Monkey-ass nigga, tuck your tail and your head roll
Go tell that to them chicks and them hoes
The players you think you got, got my back and I theirs
And like my classic Cadillac we gonna roll for years and years
So good luck, bucking young bolt, don't disrepect me
I'll play you like a pussy ho, you can't check me[Playa Hamm]
Yeahh.. bout time the troops do it, stay true with another flow
So I keep it fluid, stack to stack, but still I flip this ho
You know like I know players do playin why you push me?
Can't be goin out like no trick just cause of my love for good pussy
Brown-skinned and body like BOW BOW has to have it (gots to)
But breakin myself for a ho? Nah that's that silly rabbit
And I'm not here Slim Jim's a choosy fellow
And I got my choice, do you hear me baby? Hello!
Nah, I ain't clownin just remindin you of the fact
When you met this black young playa, you met a mack
And I only say that, cause bitches tell me everyday
"You can have all you want, long as I can come and play"
Now if I got it like that, then I'm mackin to the tune
Don't make an ass out of u and me just cause you assume
Yeah it might be to get her home to groan, no I ain't rich
But one thing's for god damn sure, I'm a playa bitch

Chorus: PPC (repeat 3X)

I'm a playa, BITCH! I thought you knew
Like every other playa, in my crew

[Tweet Cadillac]
Eloquent, slick, savvy conversation
Undoubtedly makes me pimp of the nation
A power playa, conclusively describes me
So when you hear the term refer to PPC
Suckers speculated, on how a true playa chilled
But didn't peep the real but had their hands in the till
So how you figure nigga you can bullshit a bullshitter
One hit I got the one-hitter quitter
Three hundred and thirty-degrees of jungle fever
Fuck black pussy, I don't want y'all either
Got me an Italian bitch, on my diggy diggy dick
I'm thinkin about sellin out cause all you black hoes trippin
So what's my occupation? Yo, I sell pussy hoes
I got a boost a nympho dick sucka
Taught her every single way to play a motherfucker
If you proper doppa zoppa you gon' slang that ass

Chorus

[Playa Hamm]
Oh yeah, now Pimpin Carl, told me to kick the hoes to the curb
Any disrespectin bitch I diss gets what a bitch deserves
I met this tender, golden skin, green eyes, thick and lean
Baby told me she was twenty but bitch was only seventeen
But the pussy, that shit was like angel food cake
And I woulda ate it, but that woulda been a fatal mistake
Baby came to the Penthouse tried to clown me with my girl
I ain't been up in you bitch, so why you rockin my world?
Now my lady didn't trip, she just stayed in her place
Like a lady's supposed to, and I shut the door in the young bitch's face
Next time break it from the top serve me not from the bottom
I know you know I know you know bitches bitch I got em
I makes love to my lady and fuck my bitches swell
I treat my lady like a bitch sometimes but she can't tell
So this is from me to you, I know which is which
So call me when you're twenty-two, cause I'm a playa bitch

Chorus

[Tweet Cadillac]
I told you befo' just like I'm tellin you now
We all can co-exist without a motherfuckin twist
I'm a P.I.M.P. - Positive Image Makin Progress
Fuck the dumb shit I kicks that fly shit
For you bitches, I got my hand in the pussy jar
So who's next to get kicked out the car
Of this money back guaranteed bitch getter
Smooth ho stealer, chug-a-luggin on a Miller
I got the bank, finesse, looks and brains
And a big fat black long ding-a-ling
So tally ho, tally ho, said it befo'
No insubordination out of my hoes
If you steppin this way girl you payin what you weigh
That's what my playa buddy RaeRae used to always say
Cause I'mma Trojan, and I'm rollin like Nolan
And best believe girl the car ain't stolen!

Chorus (2/3rds)[Eazy-E]
This is Eazy motherfuckin' E, coming to you direct from the Penthouse
And we chillin' in this motherfucker

Oh yeah, now Pimpin Carl, told me to kick the hoes to the curb
Any disrespectin bitch I diss gets what a bitch deserves
I met this tender, golden skin, green eyes, thick and lean
Baby told me she was twenty but bitch was only seventeen
But the pussy, that shit was like angel food cake
And I woulda ate it, but that woulda been a fatal mistake
Baby came to the Penthouse tried to clown me with my girl
I ain't been up in you bitch, so why you rockin my world?
Now my lady didn't trip, she just stayed in her place
Like a lady's supposed to, and I shut the door in the young bitch's face
Next time break it from the top serve me not from the bottom
I know you know I know you know bitches bitch I got em
I makes love to my lady and fuck my bitches swell
I treat my lady like a bitch sometimes but she can't tell
So this is from me to you, I know which is which
So call me when you're twenty-two, cause I'm a playa bitch

Chorus

[Tweet Cadillac]
I told you befo' just like I'm tellin you now
We all can co-exist without a motherfuckin twist
I'm a P.I.M.P. - Positive Image Makin Progress
Fuck the dumb shit I kicks that fly shit
For you bitches, I got my hand in the pussy jar
So who's next to get kicked out the car
Of this money back guaranteed bitch getter
Smooth ho stealer, chug-a-luggin on a Miller
I got the bank, finesse, looks and brains
And a big fat black long ding-a-ling
So tally ho, tally ho, said it befo'
No insubordination out of my hoes
If you steppin this way girl you payin what you weigh
That's what my playa buddy RaeRae used to always say
Cause I'mma Trojan, and I'm rollin like Nolan
And best believe girl the car ain't stolen!

Chorus (2/3rds)[Playa Hamm]
The P, a playa, a pimp, so add some paper
All combined to give these others the vapors
Now I'm a try and refrain from getting deep like I always do
But if I deepen it's the depth I'm true
But like I said I ain't, yet I'm a still paint a picture
Of a playa, jumping sucker rhyme sayers
Never giving a clue to how I do what I do
But if a sucker was true, he'd be a player, too
It's mind over matter, and babe it don't matter
So when you knock a new one, let your pockets get fatter
A player's style is this one, and if I don't diss one
Sucker in this rhyme, I'm a diss by the thousands
To quote David G, "Used to be is like never was"
If I ain't your blood, then I ain't your cuz
How can I drop any lesser than my predecessor?
The rhymes I blow I blow, cause they don't know

"They don't know what I know" (Repeat 2x)

[Playa Hamm]
How to blow and throw and grow, as I flow and
Keep it simple, a playa rhyme is a temple
Save it for the true players, staying like that
So stay true and you too can get fat
Like I do, don't cheat yourself
Trueness keeps you in good health, so treat yourself
What I mean is fakers are a dime a dozen
Yeah you though he was true girl, but he wasn't
As true as I am, the one and only Playa Hamm
Comes this way man, and the suckers say "Damn that's dope!"
They ain't got much hope
Don't really know, they can't cope
I am the soap and the water, suckers need bathing
The purity of Penthouse, they ain't fading
Trying for years and years, what to do in 30 minutes
Cause I see all up in it
I'm a legend in your life

"They don't know what I know" (Repeat 2x)

[Playa Hamm]
I learned a lession bout fessin', proing and not conning
That's why I'm real, busting rhymes beyond any
Sucker tearing shit off, Penthouse ain't soft
But hardcore and a whole hell of a lot more
Quik beats to play with, dance and romance to
Playa rhymes to play, when slapped, take a chance to
Fade a true playa, might wimp when I freak
I keep coming, fading you is like slumming
This is a necessity, consider it prophecy
The coming of a savior here to S-A-V-E
Suckers, from a fate worse than death
The state of being suckers, but for some it's too late
I create rhymes others onlt wish they had
Cause I'm a tad bit better, and much more ingeneous
Sometimes I wish I said what a sucker says
Cause his cap, but suckers luck but
My rap ain't for everyone cause I diss
Yeah I'm concieted, in this game you need it
I won't bow down for props I must drop for
A few, cause a few are true to their game

"They don't know what I know" (Repeat 2x)[Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, you ain't my woman no more
I gave you a chance, I got bitches out there hoeing for
A real nigga, sharing his world and his fat checks
Now your ass ??? complaining while I'm chilling with them hoes next
The different when I rip, or the one I want to get with
Baby tripping, I'm dismissing a ho for the next bitch
I'm rolling, like Kane in control, I navigate
Step to me, you respect me, must I reiterate?
You can't check me, I ain't that brother you're used to
Fade in the brain with that ??? attitude
Just because you got Papa Boo and the nuts I rest in
I ain't that nigga you can freak and be testing
Any questions? Yeah I can be a gentle man
But I'm a G baby, you can't get bent but I can
I want a real woman, not a groupie or a nut ho
You can't check me, things ain't like the folks

[Tweed]
Oh yeah, ring around the hoes, and that's just how the story goes
And Playa Hamm out there stepping on toes
They puts 'em up their nose
But that's a whole nother episode

[Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, you need to sit back and observe this
And I don't give a fuck if I get on your nerves, bitch
Cause I'm living good, and you want what you can't have
Some you took for granted, so now you feel the wrath
For the half and hot laugh, I know you want a cut
I wouldn't give you the pleasure of tasting my nuts
I'd rather jack off (Bitch!) And serve it to the curb
Than give you any type of action like that you little birds
So now you get served, I know you homeboys is shocked
I bet you had them bitches thinking you still had me locked
But not the Playa Hamm, playing no favorites
Taking no prisoners, and I say baby I'm with this on hock
Is she in it to win it? She can't lose, you need naw ass
I draw the line, baby gon' bump it or go out with the trash
We got an understanding, and my true is gon' affect this
Already knew like you know now, you can't check me

[Tweed]
Aw yeah, either shit or get off the pot
And if you can't let ??? rock
Park your crab extention nails down the block
And take that busta-ass nigga with ya

[Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, sucka fall in, take your place
Cause we don't just eliminate boy, we erase
No trace of your purpotrating ass will they find
No clues, no witnesses, no body, no crime
My family and I are compelled to this realness
Sword to uphold PPC and its chillness
Yeah, I'm that nigga, that gravedigga figure
Take a sucker good care, I ain't have to pull the trigger
You'd better recognize what you're up against and blend in
My brothers already want your head in the den
Monkey-ass nigga, tuck your tail and your head roll
Go tell that to them chicks and them hoes
The players you think you got, got my back and I theirs
And like my classic Cadillac we gonna roll for years and years
So good luck, bucking young bolt, don't disrepect me
I'll play you like a pussy ho, you can't check me
