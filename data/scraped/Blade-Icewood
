Detroit (Yeaaaaaah) That’s The City I Claim
I’m On Stage Twenty Thousand People Screaming My Name
Damn Near Died, Nine Twenty O Four
Looking At My Son’s Eyes While Im Bleeding On The Floor
So You See, Being Icewood Ain’t That Easy
Please Believe, Easy Hoes Gone See Hoes Easy
And Even With That Other Nigga, I Ain’t Saying No Names
I Was Laughing That Night Yo Little Boss Got Flamed
I Was Blowing On The Chokers Banging Sounds In The Range
Niggas Always Hating When You Worth A Lil Change
And I Ain’t A Angel I Know My Life Need Change
That’s Why Every Night I Fall To My Knees And Prayed To His Name

[ Hook x2 ][Intro]
I want to give it all to you
Dedicating this one to the streets. Detroit
Nigga gotta hustle westside, eastside, southwest
Whatever way you gotta do it, but stay low, out the way

[Verse 1]
Another day, another dollar I make
Another risk I take
Dodging haters in the Jacob
Mama tell me to keep my head up
I gotta get my bread up
Who would've knew I had to give my legs up?
Sitting up in a wheelchair
Preaching like, "Son be glad that your still here"
Still where?
It's feeling like a part of me gone
I'll be glad when my brother get home
That's when I learn that
Life is life; you live or die
I guess that's why everyday I get high
Got a wife now, two kids in my life now
Feds trying to dict because of my mobish lifestyle
My pops like, "dawg just pipe down."
Same day I took the Benz filled the trunk with sounds
Then I took a little trip fill the trunk with pounds
If my dead homie Mike he could see me now

[Adlib.]
I remember being broke without a dime
Yall niggas didn't wanna fuck with me, you know what I'm saying?
Now a nigga got cheese
Phone won't stop ringing
You know what I'm saying;
Niggas won't stop hollering at a nigga
It's crazy how we on top

[Verse 2]
To all my homies caught in the streets:
I don't blame you dog do what you do to eat
New kicks on you feet, need clothes on you back
Got a 9'' in your pocket, you don't know how to act
Cause you never had nothing, a product of the slums
Now you got funds, now life seems fun
Dawg, pump ya breaks watch for snakes
Fake niggas ain't far dawg though, they right in your face
They riding in the car blowing gans with you
You think he your man he just waiting to get you
He'll steal ya customs steal ya hustle
Soon as you go down he ain't nowhere to be found
Sounds crazy and I ain't trying to preach
But the heat is on that's why I keep the chrome
And they'll never get another chance to take me out
And nigga next time you better take me out

[Adlib]
Damn
This nigga ran up from the crib
Popped me up, You know what I'm saying?
While laying with the (?)
Ends up in the hospital like, "Shit"
Nigga's still alive
(?)

[Verse 3]
Little blade need a new bike
His mama need new ice
Thats why I hustle all day all night
I decided mine, Keep my eye on the grind
So stay outta mine or get sprayed with the 9
And this my life dawg and I ain't braggin
Maggin stashin? Chrysler wagon
I heard they put a tag on my head (tag on my head)
Well get ya money back dawg I ain't dead
I ain't broke, matter fact a little bit richer
When I was young I learned to look at the bigger picture
See snitches go to hell rich niggas just want bail and
My niggas upstate just wanna get out of jail
And to you bitch ass niggas that shot me up dawg...
(I wanna give it all to you)

You know I remember driving up the freeway with my brother dropping him off at the fair joint, you know what Im sayin
Like, "Dawg I got you."
Two weeks later dude he callin me from the hospital
Dawg you still alive nigga
Fuck the bullshit
Yeah dawg but barely breathing
You know what I'm saying?
It's like a time to remember you know what I'm saying
I'm going through rehab with my headphones on like
"I can't wait to walk again, I can't wait to walk again."
You know now I'm back up on my feet
You know what I'm saying?
Ain't shit changed, I ain't missed nothing[Intro skit for first 43 seconds]

[Royce Da 5'9" & (Blade Icewood)]
Yeah, yeah
When the rubber band pops from the top of them stacks
Mami drop them tops 'fore them dollars go back
In my pocket or the trunk of the black Impala
Where the pump just sit for them punks who trip
But besides that, life's good - yeah
This my nigga Blade right here (you could call me Icewood)

[Ingrid Smalls + (Royce Da 5'9")]
Icewood? (Icewood) I could
Go home witchu baby if the pipe good

[Royce Da 5'9"]
We get a whole lot of scrilla, fo'-fives is wit us
Whole flight can fill us, Globetrotter nigga
When you see a plus sign in front of like twelve numbers
On your cell that's me calling to tell you
That I ain't at home (yeah)
I'm witnessing the midnight sun in Finland with the big row bone
With six different funds
Coronas, pesos, zeros, the list goes on
We send henchmen to wet ya
In between trips to the Philippines with strippers wit us
Bet chips on Pistons, gassed off sheed (yeah)
Yelling pass the ball to Rip and Billups, mami

[Chorus: Jay Black]
If you got love for me, then do your little dance for me
Turn that ass around, (turn around) and keep doing what you dooooo
If you got a thang for me, then do your thang for me
Turn that ass around, (turn around) cause you've got it coming

[Blade Icewood + (Ingrid Smalls)]
Turn that ass 'round, ma you know I'm a clown
Throw a little money 'round, do my dance to the sounds
Worth a whole lotta cash, so you know I got the pound on me
Yeah dance for my homie (damn what's the nigga name?)
Five-Nine (Five-Nine)

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Pimp game got it going from the first line
Chain plenty hang time, yeah

[Blade Icewood]
G-4 plane flying, '05 Range driving
If the deal ain't least ten mil' I ain't signing
Heard she can make it do the "Nolia Clap"
It's Mr. Blade Icewood the new king of rap
I got these shots for you haters (c'mon)
Tell the waiters bring the shots, use the liquor to motivate her
To hop up in the whip, before she leave the lot
Got my dick between her lips; hand between her hips
On some freaky shit, yeah ain't know I did it like that
She thought it was all rap 'til she screaming on her back
Playa, we send henchmen to wet ya
In between trips to the Philippines with strippers wit us
Bet chips on Pistons, gassed off she
Saying pass the bar to rip in buildings, mami

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, we hit makers with acres
We hit Vegas with chips major, we can't just
Ball like the usual team, we stay whyling
Up the challenge, fuck it, tear up the palace
Fuck with, nothing but them trucks with, halogen lights
Did bad in his life, them cuts and calluses
In the G-4, in a suit, eating soufflc
In the seat big get your coupe, nigga go play

[Blade Icewood]
Hey come over here!
Well you can have it your way, blow cabbage all day
Ice, everywhere, bought it from all yay
This ain't no spaceship, gave the Rover a facelift
Lift the fifth to my lips while she moving her hips
Yeahhh - side to side, I decide
When the time is right for us to slide
We ain't moving at the mansion yet, the panty's wet
That's how you feel off a pill, why you panicking?
Go away!
