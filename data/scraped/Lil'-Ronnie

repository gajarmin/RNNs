[Intro: Mike Posner]
Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know
You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go

I know I've been away
But I, I, I, I, I, I

Cuz we always end up fucking Every time I'm in town
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Baby I just landed, you gon pick me up
Heard you like to squirt, I might lick it up
Conspicuous, I speed it up
And I slow it down like I'm on Robitussin
I'm known for crushin', you're known for blushin'
Oh what was that
You blowing kisses, I throw em back, pull into that culdesac
Back then no chauffeur, back seat like a sofa
One leg on my shoulder, other leg and it's over

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Met her once and you missed me, girl you crazy
No makeup on, you're still pretty lady
And you beautiful, inside and outside
I don't know if I should buy my wife a house, or make you my house wife
You call me, I come through
You pass out, I come too
Dippin it like fondue, spinach dip, cheese stick
Appetizers, entrees, it's you in that lingerie
As far as race, you're first place, I'm only in town for one day

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Outro: Mike Posner]
Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know

While I'm out here doing my thing in Tallahassee
You all out here treating my wife like a straight ho

[Bow Wow]
Fifth album (fifth album), am still fresh (still fresh)
New money (new money), big cheques (big cheques)

All you other lil' niggas stay in your lane
I see y'all doin your thang, but y'all ain't this man
Took me 13 years to get like this man
In the big league, GT ridin on rims
Like the Franchise Boyz, I'm a franchise boyyyy
On every magazine, the girls love him
Take but you can't place no one above him
Number one draft pick, Young Bow Weezy
I make this whole rap thing look so easy

50 carats in my chain man it's kinda breezy
And I gets Cash Money like Lil' Weezy (uh-huh)
Please believe me man I got Ohio runnin with me
Been through a lot of bullshit in the past year
Relationships, couple rumors, you know how it is
B.I.G. said the best "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"
The more money I made, came more problems
After the problems came more drama
Even my own mama said don't trust nobody
I only trust God and I only trust me
I stay to my low so my real low key (what's your name)
B-O-W-W-O, W you just listen to the flow
L-B dub G-A-N-G

And man the press keep on askin me
Am I gonna hang the mic up at age 19
Nah, I can't now I'm addicted to the cream
Addicted to the game, I'm addicted to my dream
I'm runnin over niggas like Jerome Bettis
And If I ain't the best, then what am I
Listen, I ain't really gotta say no more
I'm the prince homeboy act like you know, uh
My life (my life), I got it made (I got it made)
I wanna welcome y'all to 'The Price of Fame' (price of fame)

Prince of the Rap Game (repeat 5X)[R. Kelly]
Kels, Bow Weezy, jackin for chicks
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I'ma flirt, soon as I see her walk up in the club I'ma flirt
Winkin eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs I'ma flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low I'ma flirt
And when she's with her man lookin at me damn right I'ma flirt
So homies don't bring your girl to meet me cause I'ma flirt
And babies don't bring your girlfriend to eat cause I'ma flirt
Please believe it unless your game is tight and you trust herrr
Then, don't bring her 'round me because I'ma flirt

[Bow Wow - starts over end of Chorus]
It better be real tight too knahmtalkinbout?
You bring your girl around me man you better put your best pimp foot foward

I'ma be pimpin, I don't be slippin
When it come down to these hoes
I don't love 'em, we don't cuff 'em
Man that's just the way it goes
I pull up in the Phantom, all the ladies think handsome
Jewelry shinin, I stay stuntin, that's why these {niggas} can't stand 'em
I'ma chick mag-a-net, and anything fine I'm baggin it
And if she got a man, I don't care
10 toes and I'm on the beat cause I gotta have it
Now now, who do it like B-O-dub, girls on me when I walk in the club
Game ain't tight I'ma take yo' chick, that's it man now your girl in love
With a rich {nigga}, fly young dude, ride with me lil' momma can't lose
Don't get mad at me homey because your girlfriend choose
See this is how it's goin down in the six-one-fo'
From the 'Natti up to Clevland even in Toledo
I'ma boss and you know it, I got the money I'ma show it (that's right)
If I give your girl one chance to talk to me homey she ain't gon' blow it
Haha, now the moral of the story is cuff yo' chick
Cause hey, I'm black, fresh, and I rap, plus I'm rich
And I'ma flirt

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
I'ma flirt, now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it come to {hoes} I be pimpin like I supposed to
Rollin like I supposed to, shinin like I supposed to
In the club {fuckin} with honies like I supposed to
I don't understand when a {nigga} bring his girlfriend to the club
Crepein all on the flo' with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these players tryin to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom {nigga} I'ma holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin through the mall
If I could man I would probably flirt with all of y'all
Yeah yeah homey, you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her, I'ma be like Tarzan
Believe me mayne, this is how them players do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of story is cuff yo' {bitch}
Cause hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing, plus I'm rich
And I'ma flirt

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
F-L-I-R-T; ay, lil' momma you know I'ma
F-L-I-R-T; ay, lil' momma you know I'ma flirt

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt...No one will win the war, see families only die
And birds won't soar the sky and there'll be no sun to shine
No country wins a war, the grass won't grow the same
The moon won't shine at night and there's a losing fight
Nobody wins a war

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a rocket was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring?

No soldier wins a war, see soldiers only die
And mamas only cry just for a conscious flag to fly
That's why nobody wins a war, no war is worth your life
See that's a priceless pride, no war is worth your blood
Nobody wins a war

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a rocket was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
Tell me who would you pray to?

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a rocket was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring?
No one wins a war

No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war
No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war

No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war
No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war
We, the people speak, speak
We want to be free of this sick bureaucracy
No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life

It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak

Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak

Your lies are your destruction, your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal, you are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow, your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage, it rots and it reeks

Of death in the wind, the foul stench of men
Basking in their cruelty, rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride, you risk all of humanity

You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know, people they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace

But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach
Deep, deep down in our beings
Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things

As our grandmothers say
Will soon be no more, will soon be no more
Because nobody, no one ever wins a war[Verse 1: J. Holiday]
Just because this beat is slow
Don't mean we can't go hard
Hold my knees, I'll stay right there
Speaking in tongues like I'm in prayer
Make you scream "Oh My God!"

[Hook]
You like it like that, So I'mma give it to ya (Give it to Ya)
No holding back, However you want I'll give it to ya
(Oh) I'm going in (Oh) I'll never end
Baby I love it when we touch, We can make love after we fuck
Ooh Oooh yeah, After we fuck, We fuck
Yeaaah, After we
Damn this feels so good (You're amazing)
Damn this feels so good (Gets you crazy)
I can never ever get enough, Get enough
We can make love, After We

[Verse 2]
Ooooh, I'm gonna make you (Scream my name)
I know you like that pleasures and pain
You're driving me crazy girl (So insane)
Bed soaking wet, Playing in the rain

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Playing in your hair, grabbing everywhere
The love's in the air, The air
Rubbing on your thighs and looking in your eyes
Cause it's time to make Looooooove!
Like I've been locked up for years
They just let me out, I'm about to let it out baby

I ain't even supposed to be here
It's my guilty conscience[Verse 1: J. Holiday]
Just because this beat is slow
Don't mean we can't go hard
Hold my knees, I'll stay right there
Speaking in tongues like I'm in prayer
Make you scream "Oh My God!"

[Hook]
You like it like that, So I'mma give it to ya (Give it to Ya)
No holding back, However you want I'll give it to ya

Baby I love it when we touch, We can make love after we fuck
Ooh Oooh yeah, After we fuck, We fuck
Yeaaah, After we

Damn this feels so good (Gets you crazy)
I can never ever get enough, Get enough
We can make love, After We

[Verse 2]
Ooooh, I'm gonna make you (Scream my name)

You're driving me crazy girl (So insane)
Bed soaking wet, Playing in the rain

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Playing in your hair, grabbing everywhere
The love's in the air, The air
Rubbing on your thighs and looking in your eyes
Cause it's time to make Looooooove!
Like I've been locked up for years
They just let me out, I'm about to let it out baby

I ain't even supposed to be here
It's my guilty conscience[Lil Ronnie: Talking Intro]
This fill like life getting to me man
Fill like I don't know what to
Do
This music shit, its all in my head
But at the same time... A nigga
Chasing this bread.. I can't stop
But I Know right from wrong
So.... I'm a
Take it day by day
And not let this shit distract me

[Verse 1: Lil Ronnie]Lord knows I can't afford another one
I Plan to get that money back from my lawyer and double it
I'm done wit this
Its over my shoulder its in the past.... Shit how long will it
Last..
Couple of days, couple of months.. Couple of shots
Complimenting the blunts
And I don't even smoke heavy
Filling like that day in the bricks
When I got peer pressured

[Hook: Hezzie Hez & Lil Ronnie]
My life got me going insane
My life got me feeling the pain (but it's my life)
My life got a nigga reacting
My life got a nigga distracted (butit's my life)
{2X}

[Verse 2: Lil Ronnie]
Baby girl getting bigger and starting to understand
Time to put this plan to affect and be a man
Take everything that I got and make it righteous
No more sleeping in spots to get the diapers
No more calling on mommy to bring that bail money
Ain't trying to see that face she make, it ain't funny
It's the opposite
Pain in her eyes, I wonder if she cried on the way to her pride
And Joy..
Not right now, I'm something like a little devil running round wild
In the latest style
Treating women file
Like I don't need you bitch... Put it in ya mouth...
That's some ignorant shit ain't it
But that's the way the streets be talking when you getting paper
Right now I'm chilling sipping expensive liquor
Mix wit the pimping in me it makes an exquisite mixer

[Hook: Hezzie Hez & Lil Ronnie]
My life got me going insane
My life got me feeling the pain (but it's my life)
My life got a nigga reacting
My life got a nigga distracted (but it's my life)
{2X}

[Verse 3: Lil Ronnie]
It's like I'm creeping up on limelight
But I'm still blinded
Streets got a nigga thinking weight on consignment
Dam I hope I find it, talking bout my destiny
Hope that when she see me, she smile and be affectionate
If she grab on to me I promise to embrace back
No fake shit, I'm a kiss her and tell her taste that
Yeah that's real rap, You like my recipe
I share it just stay faithful and fuck wit me
And I'm a do the same, try to stay on my job
Fuck the fame, fuck the models
Is the model now (but what about the models now)
Try to stay away
But fashion might be the death of me
Give me a little play
I like Giuseppe heels, and them Prada dresses
They ain't gotta stay, just like to see em exit
Y'all can keep that bullshit
No time for stressing, sexing was the lesson

And I slow it down like I'm on Robitussin
I'm known for crushin', you're known for blushin'
Oh what was that
You blowing kisses, I throw em back, pull into that culdesac
Back then no chauffeur, back seat like a sofa
One leg on my shoulder, other leg and it's over

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Met her once and you missed me, girl you crazy
No makeup on, you're still pretty lady
And you beautiful, inside and outside
I don't know if I should buy my wife a house, or make you my house wife
You call me, I come through
You pass out, I come too
Dippin it like fondue, spinach dip, cheese stick
Appetizers, entrees, it's you in that lingerie
As far as race, you're first place, I'm only in town for one day

No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war
We, the people speak, speak
We want to be free of this sick bureaucracy
No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life

It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak

Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak

Your lies are your destruction, your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal, you are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow, your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage, it rots and it reeks

Of death in the wind, the foul stench of men
Basking in their cruelty, rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride, you risk all of humanity

You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know, people they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace

But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach
Deep, deep down in our beings
Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things

As our grandmothers say
Will soon be no more, will soon be no more
Because nobody, no one ever wins a war[Intro]
Hey Bow, watchu' gon do on this one
It's your fifth album homeboy (yeah)
You gotta let people know out here who's talkin on the streets
Sayin you can't do this, you can't do that
You gotta let 'em know you on your grind
It's crunch time baby (L-B dub, let's go)

[Bow Wow]
Fifth album (fifth album), am still fresh (still fresh)
New money (new money), big cheques (big cheques)
I'm the Prince of the Hip Hop Game (that's right)
All you other lil' niggas stay in your lane
I see y'all doin your thang, but y'all ain't this man
Took me 13 years to get like this man
In the big league, GT ridin on rims
Like the Franchise Boyz, I'm a franchise boyyyy
On every magazine, the girls love him
Take but you can't place no one above him
Number one draft pick, Young Bow Weezy
I make this whole rap thing look so easy
I make the crowd go crazy like Young Jeezy
50 carats in my chain man it's kinda breezy
And I gets Cash Money like Lil' Weezy (uh-huh)
Please believe me man I got Ohio runnin with me
Been through a lot of bullshit in the past year
Relationships, couple rumors, you know how it is
B.I.G. said the best "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"
The more money I made, came more problems
After the problems came more drama
Even my own mama said don't trust nobody
I only trust God and I only trust me
I stay to my low so my real low key (what's your name)
B-O-W-W-O, W you just listen to the flow
L-B dub G-A-N-G
I rep that 'til the day I D-I-E
And man the press keep on askin me
Am I gonna hang the mic up at age 19
Nah, I can't now I'm addicted to the cream
Addicted to the game, I'm addicted to my dream
I'm runnin over niggas like Jerome Bettis
And If I ain't the best, then what am I
Listen, I ain't really gotta say no more
I'm the prince homeboy act like you know, uh
My life (my life), I got it made (I got it made)
I wanna welcome y'all to 'The Price of Fame' (price of fame)
And e'rybody know the name
It's Bow Wow but I'm off so no names huh

{*scratches*)
Prince of the Rap Game (repeat 5X)[R. Kelly]
Kels, Bow Weezy, jackin for chicks
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I'ma flirt, soon as I see her walk up in the club I'ma flirt
Winkin eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs I'ma flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low I'ma flirt
And when she's with her man lookin at me damn right I'ma flirt
So homies don't bring your girl to meet me cause I'ma flirt
And babies don't bring your girlfriend to eat cause I'ma flirt
Please believe it unless your game is tight and you trust herrr
Then, don't bring her 'round me because I'ma flirt

[Bow Wow - starts over end of Chorus]
It better be real tight too knahmtalkinbout?
You bring your girl around me man you better put your best pimp foot foward

I'ma be pimpin, I don't be slippin
When it come down to these hoes
I don't love 'em, we don't cuff 'em
Man that's just the way it goes
I pull up in the Phantom, all the ladies think handsome
Jewelry shinin, I stay stuntin, that's why these {niggas} can't stand 'em
I'ma chick mag-a-net, and anything fine I'm baggin it
And if she got a man, I don't care
10 toes and I'm on the beat cause I gotta have it
Now now, who do it like B-O-dub, girls on me when I walk in the club
Game ain't tight I'ma take yo' chick, that's it man now your girl in love
With a rich {nigga}, fly young dude, ride with me lil' momma can't lose
Don't get mad at me homey because your girlfriend choose
See this is how it's goin down in the six-one-fo'
From the 'Natti up to Clevland even in Toledo
I'ma boss and you know it, I got the money I'ma show it (that's right)
If I give your girl one chance to talk to me homey she ain't gon' blow it
Haha, now the moral of the story is cuff yo' chick
Cause hey, I'm black, fresh, and I rap, plus I'm rich
And I'ma flirt

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
I'ma flirt, now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it come to {hoes} I be pimpin like I supposed to
Rollin like I supposed to, shinin like I supposed to
In the club {fuckin} with honies like I supposed to
I don't understand when a {nigga} bring his girlfriend to the club
Crepein all on the flo' with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these players tryin to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom {nigga} I'ma holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin through the mall
If I could man I would probably flirt with all of y'all
Yeah yeah homey, you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her, I'ma be like Tarzan
Believe me mayne, this is how them players do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of story is cuff yo' {bitch}
Cause hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing, plus I'm rich
And I'ma flirt

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
F-L-I-R-T; ay, lil' momma you know I'ma
F-L-I-R-T; ay, lil' momma you know I'ma flirt

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt...[Intro]

Nigga ain't no hold on back up
You all niggas gonna make me act up

And you all out here tearing her back up
And you just can't tell me that you didn't see that ring on her finger
I'm even tryna help her be a singer
That's why she was at that party in Atlanta
When I told her ass not to go out to Chicago
While I'm out here doing my thing in Tallahassee
You all out here treating my wife like a straight ho
I can't believe this bitch
I can't believe this shit
Everything I ever did for her I'm taking it back, I'm so through with it
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
I took time out of my life to have these niggas fuck my wife and then call her...

And I call her bobble head
The way she wiggle it when I'm hitting it from the back up in my bed
And the way she be screaming my name
And the way she be giving me brain, and when it's all over
