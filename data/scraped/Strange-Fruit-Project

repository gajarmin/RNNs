[Verse One: Symbolyc]
Here we go again , floating in
Another brother needin' help
He just need to hold the hand
Make moves , dealing with these fake dudes
Notice how a snake moves
Tell 'em how we pay dues
Bang bang , shoot 'em up
Brother need to loosen up
'Bout to go to war again and all we do is suit 'em up
I was 'bout to give it up
But I think they need us now
Earned another power up and hit it to the [?]
Didn't write this , did it in my brain man
Russian roulette , another artist playing hangman
Let's play another game man
We got a [?]
Make another bad move , make a another skip turn
Funny how we live an learn , give and earn
I don't really know , they say the chronic make the liver burn
Spin y'all
I don't want to sin y'all
Another day of livings like another game of pinball

[Hook: Symbolyc One]
It's just another game of pinball
I might even win y'all
Sometimes we win big sometimes we win small
Funny how we bounce back
Off The Wall like Michael Jackson
Time for some action
Let's play another game of pinball
So put your money where your mouth is
You know where the south is
Funny how we bounce back
Off The Wall like Michael Jackson
Time for some action

[Verse 2: Myone]
Yo
Is it the right ,  is it the left , is it the straight away
No matter how it goes I gotta make a way for greater days
Attracted to the neon lights that's tilted on the stage
Signing another contract
Get an advance in pay
When people got plans to pay
[?] will not delay
I've taken beatens many times , my nigga not today
I bounce back on any negative y'all got to say
I know you all singing how one cat got away
I'm to slick but I'm slow to [?]
[?] reciting they rhymes
Sleep with no rehearsal
Forward with no reversal
An overload on purple
These niggas stupid running in circles
Chasing they own tail
We know without fail
Freedom without bail
We deliver good mail (mail , mail mail)
It's the Strange Fruit without fail
On a cruise and this shit 'bout to set sail

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Myth]
Gobble gobble
I eat emcees like Pac-Man
Sometimes , yo , I think these critics be on crack man
Hold up , rewind that
Please take it back man [sound of rewinding]
Yo , I eat emcees like Pac-Man
The legend of Myth
Burn a hole through the track
American bandstand
Keep these niggas dancing like the man [?]
Call me mister sandman [?]
Watch me [?] vigor-ously
Then catch the image
Like a Polar Boy picture
Smile for the camera while I concoct this elixir
Slap you with the slapstick
Donkey Kong these emcees running round these mini mes
Moving like I'm Centipede
Don't really care who's feeling me
Feel me or nah
Best believe when I represent I'm blowing up the spot
So connect the dots
And watch me stack the blocks like Tetris
Who care who the best is the game ain't over yet kid

[Hook]


(Intro to Liberation)
Woo dowdy...
Tell you what
I picked the wrong time to move to Galveston , Texas
I mean look at this mess!
Ah well , just have to pick up the pieces and keep on trucking
Maybe sell some property
Wonder if them Strange Fruit boys looking for a manager?
Ahh well , guess I have to make some lemonade{Verse 1: Myone}
Soon as I open my eyes, I realize that I could be gone
The days of our lives don't take long
And any moment you blink
Might be another golden moment extinct
And I'm just hoping that you only would think, maybe re-think
Cause my mission's not to kill or cause friction
It's non-fiction
And every living man's a walking contradiction
As dark and light collab to make a full composition
I know experience is not opted or propositioned
If I chose to not listen
When I was caught in a spot without a pot to piss in
I probably wouldn't be spittin'
While I'm knowing that the block is hot
I stand firm like Al Sharp's perm and give it all that I've got
We're tryin' to tear down the walls of hate to bring change
And some of ya'll scream bump the Strange
They just haters perhaps
Either way man they better relax
An ex-con that's about to relapse
Then grabbed a hold of the mic
Cause ya'll brotha's wasn't holdin' it right
And I'm a flow until the closing of light to bring change
And then some

{Hook}

{Verse 2: Myth}
I see the times have changed
But in the eyes of some
Yo, we still the same niggas
Go figure
Parents is cold killers
Killing their seeds
With no conscience, left and right
Not afraid of pulling them triggers
As we enter the troubled times
Sometimes I feel I'm better off
Mumbling rhymes
Cause ya'll ain't trying to listen anyway
Crumbling minds
Understand the words spoken from a poet
I know it
We need to bring the love back
And put it in their soul, kid

{Verse 3: Res}
We all struggle with change but see it won't happen fast
God shines through the insecurity shown on the news casts
Casting fear into the hearts of us all
Pushing carts through these halls
Of these markets consuming these products
That they say will change and sustain our lives
Why our wives are on Atkins, our daughters on Botox
Father's asking for pills to kill his depression
Those are only symptoms guiding light is misdirected

{Hook}

Welcome to the struggle
Where a poet’s gotta rhyme hustle
Going through it blind
Cus I know it's more then mind and muscle
When the Divine humbles my pride crumbles
My eyes bubble with tears
Making it clear where I stumble
It’s like I’m double when in trouble I got two sides
My life’s a puddle to the sudden glimpse of blue skies
Carry the rain away it varies from day to day
No matter where we say we’ve changed
Remember Who remains the same
We sending prayers out in His name
With the hopes it might help you cope
Giving the praise to God if you felt what I wrote
Head nodding till I melt into notes
Heart throbbing put a swell in my throat
Smooth sailing till we fell of the boat
Now we swimming in sin
Treading waiting for our ship to come in
Deep breath just before the water entered my chest
The Author of Life offered His life vest[Myone] [Verse One]
Represent the next movement
They got the revolution televised
All my people rise and recognized
We come from devine with three eyes that beam sharp like lasers
We be the Genesis like Sega
Supreme in the face of you haters
Take over this industry
Spread love instead of tryin' to be the enemy
Y'all quick to kill be slow to build
Can a brother live?
That's why we find Islam and travel through hollow minds
Penetrate the soul with a rhyme
Things gotta change
But y'all ain't listening
The soul be travelin'
Y'all been missin' the train
The brain unravelin'
Stabbin' you with a lyrical javelin
I ain't havin' it
Understand my peoples ain't savages

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait

[Verse Two] [Big Pooh]
Rise like the pop bubblin'
Rumblin' through the state of N.C
Beggin' these wanna be rappers not to test me
A bunch of fancy wordplay don't impress me
I got a couple metaphors and some similes
I'm like a countdown on New Years Eve
Most anticipated, niggas wouldn't believe
That Pooh be work, take trips overseas
Or I make one album
I'm workin' on three
Got the Strange Fruit Project
Kev workin' with me
Doin' the Texas two step, drinkin' hella ice teas
No ice in it please
Them the right degrees
I'm the coolest motherfucker on the M.I.C

[Phonte]
And when you invite me
No telling what it might be
Cause when I rhyme I devour that shit
Niggas wanna rush me and cats get touchy
Cause they know 'Te means every vowel of that shit
The A's and E's and I's don't be surprised
If I O (owe) U (you) an apology after I set it
Rough with the lyrics
But so gentile (gentle) with the flow
Most mics think I'm anti-semetic
Y'all niggas need to dead it, it's on
Man,you crazy if you think next to us you will ever get shine on
B.E.T., Uncut or Total Request Live
I ain't gotta like yours
But you gon' respect mine

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait

[Myth] [Verse Three]
Ayo, look at what y'all made us do
Runnin' away with it like 18 wheelers downhill without no break shoes
You got a problem? I got one you can't equate to
LB + SFP which one you wanna take dude?
Like it equals of evidence of statutory rape
There's no escape
From the rise of the tide, changing the landscape
The flame of man never burned brighter
Rise like the spirits of the deceased
I'm something like a ghost writer
Stay on the rise like I'm transitioning from soul
Behind my worst flow, no colder than five
You scored to low, overdosin' my mind
So I'm noted in time when it is needed
Like water when you're weeded
A little bit of space will get meaning
Raise my head to the sky, hopin' my egos gets defeated
From N.C. to the D and all points in between it
It's all on you to rise if the fall gets repeated

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait[Intro]
Yeah, back up in this
Yeah, Strange Fruit Project
Bringin' a little somethin' special on this one
Come on, 9th Wonder on the beat

[Verse 1: Symbolyc One]
Packing my bags ,  cause a brother wanna roll again
Maybe we can do this another time but I'm rowin' in
Start my motor man , I'm bout to head out
Say a little pray for myself and the I sped out
Thoughts on my family It got me hesitating now
Thoughts of insanity It got me meditating loud
Insane anger , brothers headin' for danger
Looking at my life shit is straight dangerous
It's all good, small hood, slang the dust
Another brother wanna aim and bust
So, Im out the hood and I'm living in the better city
Cause things go round like marry go  so let it go
It's getting gritty , wonderin'  where the crime went
Locked up, encarcelated, most of the time spent
Behind bars I rhyme bars if neccesary
Sort of scary how I be livin' , dwellin' in the cementery
So special ....

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
Is all in my soul
It won't let me go
It just goes on and on

[Verse 2]
First of all I thank god for my life
Shouting out to both mommas for addressing the stresses
Of wrong and right , when the pressure was on
Discipline , was giving and getting in the zone
To get it while the getting is good instead of getting it on
So I let it be known , from suburbs
To the inner city gritty [?]
She living on curbs
Many a lyrical slur
Plug it in and appease the masses
Music got that [?] for more
Like please pass it
We breeze past the past now we classic
Beyond y'all platinum plaques and shrink wrapping
Made it 9 miles without Rabbit
Mad when the run around getting rerun what's happening?
The locks getting popped on the door of the industry
Cause you were on the bill and wasn't bringing no energy
Now we [?] like synergy
Remedy for the times when an artist lacking in rhymes
So I figure that I'm...

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
It's all in my soul
Won't let me go
It just foes on and on

[Verse 3]
Sit back , relax and watch me spit the rhymes like the [?]
Rather spit on the mic than keep my lips on the bottle
In a hostile environment , a brother keep trying
Surrounded by relative fossils of classic music
Got the youngest  ask [?]
The old  school , I'm from the 70s
Baby , making music , got these cats telling me
It's cool but nothing special
Nothing next level
So I laugh it off , crack a smile , times have changed
Yo it's been a while since my brain
Been stimulated , musically penetrating my soul
Send a shiver down my spine
Reason for the rhyme
To relax the mind , like giving sight to the blind
I put the world in a bind , the unsigned hype
Now I sign autographs , all day and all night
Keep them haters out my sight
Got nothing but love
And my skills shine bright
Make the world feel special when I'm rocking the mic

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
It's all in my soul
Won't let me go
It just goes on and on

[Outro]
Yo
Gotta let y'all know we comin' with something special for show
Shout out to 9th Wonder , man for this lovely track
Nahmean?
This Hip Hop gonna be something tight
If you treat it right
Playing and stuff on the mic like it's nothing
This feeling is something real
Don't play with it
(something more than special)
Peace to all the fam , Black Sun , Verbal Sea , SFP
Deloach , free agent , Kaotix foundation
And anybody who copped this album
It's for y'all
Try to make it something special(Intro: Myone)
Yeah
We back again
In this Ready Forum
Because we ready for 'em
S1 on the track
We got Myth, Myone
Just like this

(Verse 1: Myone)
Tower to pilot
Feel as though the game is acting
A little bit childish
Ritalin's what a child gets with ADD
Add up the scores on the ACT
And act like y'all people ready for me
We be the SFP, and time-tested, certified
As Myone killing you people on the audiophone
The new hoes of the South mouth
Spoke nothing but quotables
Check the name
The whole game is more than notable
Facts: I live and die
But when I stand you best believe it
I'm ill as ebola or the resurrection of Jesus
Like God held the needle
That first injected my fetus
Take it, respect, like it or not
And you can't defeat us
Part of the text is sowed in the heart in your chest
The world's cold and it'll harden your flesh
But I stand ready for 'em
And straight away from the norm
If the mainstream ain't blowing the way
Myone was born
Now we ready

(Chorus)
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
Y'all been sleeping too long
(Keep an eye on the Strange Fruit Project)
Cause you ain't ready
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
And they've been waiting so long
(One two, two, two)
And now we're ready

(Verse 2: Symbolyc 1)
Calling us home grown
Married the microphone
Press step in the beginning
Put it on and on
We aged a little bit, baby steps
Till we're all grown
Up and away now, a beautiful day now
And though the weight is heavy
Was able to keep it steady
Through every pass, my petty cash
Would never let me
My spiritual machete
Straight in the heat of the day
Either we pray or fall down
Eager to say, We stand up to this
And word up to this
And all my peoples, if you ready
Get up to this
Cause you answer the ready forum
So notice how we was ready for 'em
Buck consistency just to show
How we was steady growing
Act like you never knowing
Infidelity showing
It's amazing how God can bless as a steady poem
Down, you see it now
Better believe it now
Understand how odds are staying
Through evil ground

(Chorus)
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
Y'all been sleeping too long
(Keep an eye on the Strange Fruit Project)
Cause you ain't ready
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
And they've been waiting so long
(One two, two, two)
And now we're ready

(Verse 3: Myth)
Well it's the philosophical rhyme-spitter
Master metaphysicist
Living large through lyricism
Defensive for rhyming against the system
Drop jewels of wisdom
Cause a cataclysm
I assent to connect it through after-rhythms
Passed on from descendant
Ancient like Egyptians
When I rip tracks and bless mics
Be my soul's inner vision
Living like a king
That's why I wrote my name in hieroglyphics
I'ma get metaphysical
Beyond the trope of dimensions
I'm at the age of innocence
Cats be acting like
They got a flow that's eminent
Y'all trippin, kids
See, dog, we ain't running this
I'm a rebel without a cause
Y'all call me rumblefist
Never compare
Matter of fact, forget touching the mic
Y'all wannabes
Talking 'bout that we rhyming aight
You better recognize
It's the intelligent, spectacular
MC specimen
I crush your mind and whatever's left of it

(Chorus)
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
Y'all been sleeping too long
(Keep an eye on the Strange Fruit Project)
Cause you ain't ready
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
And they've been waiting so long
(One two, two, two)
And now we're ready[Verse One: Myth]
Not a dime to my name, what's the price for fame?
Cats thinkin' I'm rich, got me standin' in the rain
Wishin' I had change
In my pocket when I'm rockin'
A broke MC with bad credit
And I'm still droppin' albums like I'm so hot but I'm not
A broke cat with a tore back ride
I'm from the old school and momma told me to throw back pride
Be humble in life
It's gon' be a struggle in life
Keep yo' mind right

[Symbolyc One]
I'm 'bout to give it up, give it up
See a nickle on the ground, pick it up, pick it up
The Broke Song, I'd rather be singin' The Hope Song
I never the less stress keepin' my throat strong
Money I tote wrong
Hopin' the rope's long enough
S-1, the brother with the oak tongue
No need to prolong
Stuck, got a brand new truck
Hopin' the note's gone
Come along to the song

[Scratch Hook]
"Throw back ride"
"Give it up, give it up"
"Keep ya mind right"
"Gotta work a 9 to 5"
"Don't struggle, just hustle"
"Wishin' I had change"
"What's the price for fame"
"I'm still broke"
"Cause the way we livin' now is wack"

[Verse Two: Myone]
Let's hustle like we bubblin' crack
Find a way to educate and elevate and sell this shit right back
To the powers that be
Because I know they ain't empowering me
And that didn't take me two towers to see
Know
That the world is slowly dying every day
We livin' so broke, check to check
Minimum waging ain't enough, below income stuff
Yeah I could serve kill but it's hard to pay the bill when in cuffs
So let's, flip the 5-0 until it's 0-5
Till we dictate the cost to survive
I hustle dead or alive
With the U.S. debt on the line
I wanna climb till I'm dead or resign
All I'm hearing is
"Your check bounce", a gram short of an ounce
And it's hard to pay the rent with nothin' but common sense
And since we've been dealin' with the power of the yen
We made a vow to keep hustling here until we rise up

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Myth]
My man skill on the beat
Yo I need something to eat
This hunger makes me wonder why I'm praying my soul to sleep
Threw the 20's on the Jeep
God makin' them ends meet
But I gotta produce more heat if them 20's I want to keep
So
I'd rather watch my seeds grow
Cause they foul you to shoot, call it a free throw
Knowin' a brother need doe
Blow
I'm 'bout to put the horns down
The Heavenly Father stricken me when I'm weak and when I'm torn down

[Symbolyc One]
Yo I'm stressed from the job that's got my head twisted
Livin' like I got money, I'm ballin'
Not even close y'allin'
Maxed out credit cards with a bottle full of [?]
Semi po' folks that ain't no joke
Tryin' to get my seeds some of them beautiful things
A pool in the back with a set of swings
A lot of dreams, sometimes I gotta scream
Plot and scheme ways of makin' them collared greens
Droppin' the hottest heat, rockin' the beats

[Scratch]Por el rojo de la alfombra y de tus labios carmín
Por quien te obliga a ser humano y a pensar siempre en ti
Sería una pena ser ciego y no verte cuando andas
Con esas piernas tostadas al  fuego de un sol naranja
Por mí, vivo bien,no hay porque pensar que uno está loco
Porque vea colores en las bases y las notas que toco
Hay quien sacrifica todo por bolos y más
Al menos sabemos que no estamos solos

Usted sonría, quien lo diría
Si el día esta gris de apatía y de monotonía
Yo creo un sol de mediodía en apogeo
El cielo es azul creo detrás de toda esa porquería
Pinto el deseo
Rojo rubí como tu vestido o el carmesí de tu carmín
Para venirte conmigo a morir donde nací yo
Al verde y blanco andalusí mío, di que sí

Porque el futuro negro se debe a un presente gris
Por el que confía en el amarillo y se deja el orgullo en la mesita
Granate como el Soul Travellin
Esta vez es por el que no llega a fin de mes pero se invita
No me hables de altar con este morado
Encanto, mis zapatillas es lo único que veras de blanco
Esos ojazos azules que a las nubes engañan
De corazón que es pasión lo de este tango

Porque van a por ti, van de libres colocados
Amarillos del morado, atontados en su propia nube
Y no todo lo que baja luego sube
Un fallo de joven es un futuro negro que consume
Cada marrón es tu marrón y te lo comes
Disfruta si puedes, escapa a ser un guiri
Babea con tu media naranja, alimenta tu iris
Azúcar moreno para tu daiquiri[Intro: Deloach]
Get into it
Gotta wake up
Need to wake up
Yo , yeah

I don't know 'bout y'all but I'm loving L.A man
Palm trees , sexys mama , [?]

Hold me down , gang truce , barbecues , bangers in the streets now
The way the beat sounds , summertime just round the corner
Put the top down , [?] on my face

Honeys at the bus stop make me wanna [?]

Run into the hot spots and gotta feel for some grub
Cruisin' the block , sunny blue skies
We tryna stack the money high
Get a piece of California pride
California Love , Crenshaw , Hollywood , The Bay
San Francisco , Oakland it's all love in L.A
Can't forget San Diego
That's a nice place to stay
Y'know it get cool after sunset but it's nice all day

[Verse 3: Symbolyc One]
Yeah
Seemingly feeling the land of the great rest
For good green seem is the seam for a man to [?] stress
They blaze it away , amazing the way that they do
With the Bay area ladies looking finer than , ooooooh!

Come on and get down come on now
Back a little harder than before
Come on and get down come on now

[Verse One: Symbolyc One]
Back a little harder than before
In the back woods
All them back woods
For the roads
And I lack wood
Just to feel good in the cold
Now I act good
Had to put the hood on hold to find me
Make you lose control to find beat
I can make you find the zone if I feed it
If you're deaf in your tone
Surround the sound breech
Cause it's hard to be down or around the sound cheap
So bleep out a censor
We 'bout to enter
Rock your foundation
From ex-soul to center
Next though
Bringing unlimited echoes
Marking hall cities from your
Halls to expos
Strange is the name
And y'all don't forget yo
Whether you scrub down or you rockin' the jet pulse
Check your attitude and just move to the tempo
Rock rock your body complicated the sequel
Get down

[Verse Two: Symbolyc One]
We gonna make you lose control (yeah)
Ordinary guy with a reputation
It's so amazin, I had a revelation
Pout for cake and I do a whole other
Place where you're all in my face
Just chill, brother
Peace to my beautiful dad and my mother
Plus I gotta give a shout to my fam
I still love ya
Plus the stake is high
Never let my patience die
I'm so fly I could taste the sky
Why, try, when the beat make you clap hands
When you see me up in the place
Just give me that, man
Don't say Hardy Har
And please don't say I can make you a star
I got a good groove and I got a guitar
I reach for my dreams cause they never too far, like

[Hook: Symbolyc One]
Let's party y'all
We can have a good time
It's so much fun
It'll blow your mind
Let's party tonight, let's party tonight
We'll have a real good time now

[Verse Two: Myth]
I'm tryin'a get up in the club
You gotta show a brother love
I'm 'bout to make some moves
Pass the drink to me
I'm sippin' that
She got a bell in her tongue
I know she wanna have fun
I got this ring on my finger
I give pounds to my boys (what up man?)
I show peace to my boys
I buy drinks for my boys
They playing with them rock toys
We got the wall posted up
Superstars with no bucks
Don't press my luck
I'm tryin'a have some fun, c'mon

[Verse Three: Symbolyc One]
Yes, in the place to be
With the fam in the front
And the ladies in the back chasing me
Basically, we are
Straight from the project ghetto superstars, like

[Hook: Symbolyc One]
Let's party y'all
We can have a good time
It's so much fun
It'll blow your mind
Let's party tonight, let's party tonight
We'll have a real good time now[Verse One: Symbolyc]
Here we go again , floating in
Another brother needin' help
He just need to hold the hand
Make moves , dealing with these fake dudes
Notice how a snake moves
Tell 'em how we pay dues
Bang bang , shoot 'em up
Brother need to loosen up
'Bout to go to war again and all we do is suit 'em up
I was 'bout to give it up
But I think they need us now
Earned another power up and hit it to the [?]
Didn't write this , did it in my brain man
Russian roulette , another artist playing hangman
Let's play another game man
We got a [?]
Make another bad move , make a another skip turn
Funny how we live an learn , give and earn
I don't really know , they say the chronic make the liver burn
Spin y'all
I don't want to sin y'all
Another day of livings like another game of pinball

[Hook: Symbolyc One]
It's just another game of pinball
I might even win y'all
Sometimes we win big sometimes we win small
Funny how we bounce back
Off The Wall like Michael Jackson
Time for some action
Let's play another game of pinball
So put your money where your mouth is
You know where the south is
Funny how we bounce back
Off The Wall like Michael Jackson
Time for some action

[Verse 2: Myone]
Yo
Is it the right ,  is it the left , is it the straight away
No matter how it goes I gotta make a way for greater days
Attracted to the neon lights that's tilted on the stage
Signing another contract
Get an advance in pay
When people got plans to pay
[?] will not delay
I've taken beatens many times , my nigga not today
I bounce back on any negative y'all got to say
I know you all singing how one cat got away
I'm to slick but I'm slow to [?]
[?] reciting they rhymes
Sleep with no rehearsal
Forward with no reversal
An overload on purple
These niggas stupid running in circles
Chasing they own tail
We know without fail
Freedom without bail
We deliver good mail (mail , mail mail)
It's the Strange Fruit without fail
On a cruise and this shit 'bout to set sail

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Myth]
Gobble gobble
I eat emcees like Pac-Man
Sometimes , yo , I think these critics be on crack man
Hold up , rewind that
Please take it back man [sound of rewinding]
Yo , I eat emcees like Pac-Man
The legend of Myth
Burn a hole through the track
American bandstand
Keep these niggas dancing like the man [?]
Call me mister sandman [?]
Watch me [?] vigor-ously
Then catch the image
Like a Polar Boy picture
Smile for the camera while I concoct this elixir
Slap you with the slapstick
Donkey Kong these emcees running round these mini mes
Moving like I'm Centipede
Don't really care who's feeling me
Feel me or nah
Best believe when I represent I'm blowing up the spot
So connect the dots
And watch me stack the blocks like Tetris
Who care who the best is the game ain't over yet kid

[Hook]


(Intro to Liberation)
Woo dowdy...
Tell you what
I picked the wrong time to move to Galveston , Texas
I mean look at this mess!
Ah well , just have to pick up the pieces and keep on trucking
Maybe sell some property
Wonder if them Strange Fruit boys looking for a manager?
Ahh well , guess I have to make some lemonade(Intro: Myone)
Yeah
We back again
In this Ready Forum
Because we ready for 'em
S1 on the track
We got Myth, Myone
Just like this

(Verse 1: Myone)
Tower to pilot
Feel as though the game is acting
A little bit childish
Ritalin's what a child gets with ADD
Add up the scores on the ACT
And act like y'all people ready for me
We be the SFP, and time-tested, certified
As Myone killing you people on the audiophone
The new hoes of the South mouth
Spoke nothing but quotables
Check the name
The whole game is more than notable
Facts: I live and die
But when I stand you best believe it
I'm ill as ebola or the resurrection of Jesus
Like God held the needle
That first injected my fetus
Take it, respect, like it or not
And you can't defeat us
Part of the text is sowed in the heart in your chest
The world's cold and it'll harden your flesh
But I stand ready for 'em
And straight away from the norm
If the mainstream ain't blowing the way
Myone was born
Now we ready

(Chorus)
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
Y'all been sleeping too long
(Keep an eye on the Strange Fruit Project)
Cause you ain't ready
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
And they've been waiting so long
(One two, two, two)
And now we're ready

(Verse 2: Symbolyc 1)
Calling us home grown
Married the microphone
Press step in the beginning
Put it on and on
We aged a little bit, baby steps
Till we're all grown
Up and away now, a beautiful day now
And though the weight is heavy
Was able to keep it steady
Through every pass, my petty cash
Would never let me
My spiritual machete
Straight in the heat of the day
Either we pray or fall down
Eager to say, We stand up to this
And word up to this
And all my peoples, if you ready
Get up to this
Cause you answer the ready forum
So notice how we was ready for 'em
Buck consistency just to show
How we was steady growing
Act like you never knowing
Infidelity showing
It's amazing how God can bless as a steady poem
Down, you see it now
Better believe it now
Understand how odds are staying
Through evil ground

(Chorus)
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
Y'all been sleeping too long
(Keep an eye on the Strange Fruit Project)
Cause you ain't ready
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
And they've been waiting so long
(One two, two, two)
And now we're ready

(Verse 3: Myth)
Well it's the philosophical rhyme-spitter
Master metaphysicist
Living large through lyricism
Defensive for rhyming against the system
Drop jewels of wisdom
Cause a cataclysm
I assent to connect it through after-rhythms
Passed on from descendant
Ancient like Egyptians
When I rip tracks and bless mics
Be my soul's inner vision
Living like a king
That's why I wrote my name in hieroglyphics
I'ma get metaphysical
Beyond the trope of dimensions
I'm at the age of innocence
Cats be acting like
They got a flow that's eminent
Y'all trippin, kids
See, dog, we ain't running this
I'm a rebel without a cause
Y'all call me rumblefist
Never compare
Matter of fact, forget touching the mic
Y'all wannabes
Talking 'bout that we rhyming aight
You better recognize
It's the intelligent, spectacular
MC specimen
I crush your mind and whatever's left of it

(Chorus)
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
Y'all been sleeping too long
(Keep an eye on the Strange Fruit Project)
Cause you ain't ready
Myone ready for 'em, S1 ready for 'em, Myth ready for 'em
And they've been waiting so long
(One two, two, two)
And now we're ready[Myone] [Verse One]
Represent the next movement
They got the revolution televised
All my people rise and recognized
We come from devine with three eyes that beam sharp like lasers
We be the Genesis like Sega
Supreme in the face of you haters
Take over this industry
Spread love instead of tryin' to be the enemy
Y'all quick to kill be slow to build
Can a brother live?
That's why we find Islam and travel through hollow minds
Penetrate the soul with a rhyme
Things gotta change
But y'all ain't listening
The soul be travelin'
Y'all been missin' the train
The brain unravelin'
Stabbin' you with a lyrical javelin
I ain't havin' it
Understand my peoples ain't savages

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait

[Verse Two] [Big Pooh]
Rise like the pop bubblin'
Rumblin' through the state of N.C
Beggin' these wanna be rappers not to test me
A bunch of fancy wordplay don't impress me
I got a couple metaphors and some similes
I'm like a countdown on New Years Eve
Most anticipated, niggas wouldn't believe
That Pooh be work, take trips overseas
Or I make one album
I'm workin' on three
Got the Strange Fruit Project
Kev workin' with me
Doin' the Texas two step, drinkin' hella ice teas
No ice in it please
Them the right degrees
I'm the coolest motherfucker on the M.I.C

[Phonte]
And when you invite me
No telling what it might be
Cause when I rhyme I devour that shit
Niggas wanna rush me and cats get touchy
Cause they know 'Te means every vowel of that shit
The A's and E's and I's don't be surprised
If I O (owe) U (you) an apology after I set it
Rough with the lyrics
But so gentile (gentle) with the flow
Most mics think I'm anti-semetic
Y'all niggas need to dead it, it's on
Man,you crazy if you think next to us you will ever get shine on
B.E.T., Uncut or Total Request Live
I ain't gotta like yours
But you gon' respect mine

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait

[Myth] [Verse Three]
Ayo, look at what y'all made us do
Runnin' away with it like 18 wheelers downhill without no break shoes
You got a problem? I got one you can't equate to
LB + SFP which one you wanna take dude?
Like it equals of evidence of statutory rape
There's no escape
From the rise of the tide, changing the landscape
The flame of man never burned brighter
Rise like the spirits of the deceased
I'm something like a ghost writer
Stay on the rise like I'm transitioning from soul
Behind my worst flow, no colder than five
You scored to low, overdosin' my mind
So I'm noted in time when it is needed
Like water when you're weeded
A little bit of space will get meaning
Raise my head to the sky, hopin' my egos gets defeated
From N.C. to the D and all points in between it
It's all on you to rise if the fall gets repeated

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait[Intro]
Yeah, back up in this
Yeah, Strange Fruit Project
Bringin' a little somethin' special on this one
Come on, 9th Wonder on the beat

[Verse 1: Symbolyc One]
Packing my bags ,  cause a brother wanna roll again
Maybe we can do this another time but I'm rowin' in
Start my motor man , I'm bout to head out
Say a little pray for myself and the I sped out
Thoughts on my family It got me hesitating now
Thoughts of insanity It got me meditating loud
Insane anger , brothers headin' for danger
Looking at my life shit is straight dangerous
It's all good, small hood, slang the dust
Another brother wanna aim and bust
So, Im out the hood and I'm living in the better city
Cause things go round like marry go  so let it go
It's getting gritty , wonderin'  where the crime went
Locked up, encarcelated, most of the time spent
Behind bars I rhyme bars if neccesary
Sort of scary how I be livin' , dwellin' in the cementery
So special ....

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
Is all in my soul
It won't let me go
It just goes on and on

[Verse 2]
First of all I thank god for my life
Shouting out to both mommas for addressing the stresses
Of wrong and right , when the pressure was on
Discipline , was giving and getting in the zone
To get it while the getting is good instead of getting it on
So I let it be known , from suburbs
To the inner city gritty [?]
She living on curbs
Many a lyrical slur
Plug it in and appease the masses
Music got that [?] for more
Like please pass it
We breeze past the past now we classic
Beyond y'all platinum plaques and shrink wrapping
Made it 9 miles without Rabbit
Mad when the run around getting rerun what's happening?
The locks getting popped on the door of the industry
Cause you were on the bill and wasn't bringing no energy
Now we [?] like synergy
Remedy for the times when an artist lacking in rhymes
So I figure that I'm...

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
It's all in my soul
Won't let me go
It just foes on and on

[Verse 3]
Sit back , relax and watch me spit the rhymes like the [?]
Rather spit on the mic than keep my lips on the bottle
In a hostile environment , a brother keep trying
Surrounded by relative fossils of classic music
Got the youngest  ask [?]
The old  school , I'm from the 70s
Baby , making music , got these cats telling me
It's cool but nothing special
Nothing next level
So I laugh it off , crack a smile , times have changed
Yo it's been a while since my brain
Been stimulated , musically penetrating my soul
Send a shiver down my spine
Reason for the rhyme
To relax the mind , like giving sight to the blind
I put the world in a bind , the unsigned hype
Now I sign autographs , all day and all night
Keep them haters out my sight
Got nothing but love
And my skills shine bright
Make the world feel special when I'm rocking the mic

[Hook]
This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
I can feel all in my bones
Won't let me alone
It just goes on and on

This feeling in me has got to be
(Something more than special)
It's all in my soul
Won't let me go
It just goes on and on

[Outro]
Yo
Gotta let y'all know we comin' with something special for show
Shout out to 9th Wonder , man for this lovely track
Nahmean?
This Hip Hop gonna be something tight
If you treat it right
Playing and stuff on the mic like it's nothing
This feeling is something real
Don't play with it
(something more than special)
Peace to all the fam , Black Sun , Verbal Sea , SFP
Deloach , free agent , Kaotix foundation
And anybody who copped this album
It's for y'all
Try to make it something special[Verse One: Myth]
Not a dime to my name, what's the price for fame?
Cats thinkin' I'm rich, got me standin' in the rain
Wishin' I had change
In my pocket when I'm rockin'
A broke MC with bad credit
And I'm still droppin' albums like I'm so hot but I'm not
A broke cat with a tore back ride
I'm from the old school and momma told me to throw back pride
Be humble in life
It's gon' be a struggle in life
Keep yo' mind right

[Symbolyc One]
I'm 'bout to give it up, give it up
See a nickle on the ground, pick it up, pick it up
The Broke Song, I'd rather be singin' The Hope Song
I never the less stress keepin' my throat strong
Money I tote wrong
Hopin' the rope's long enough
S-1, the brother with the oak tongue
No need to prolong
Stuck, got a brand new truck
Hopin' the note's gone
Come along to the song

[Scratch Hook]
"Throw back ride"
"Give it up, give it up"
"Keep ya mind right"
"Gotta work a 9 to 5"
"Don't struggle, just hustle"
"Wishin' I had change"
"What's the price for fame"
"I'm still broke"
"Cause the way we livin' now is wack"

[Verse Two: Myone]
Let's hustle like we bubblin' crack
Find a way to educate and elevate and sell this shit right back
To the powers that be
Because I know they ain't empowering me
And that didn't take me two towers to see
Know
That the world is slowly dying every day
We livin' so broke, check to check
Minimum waging ain't enough, below income stuff
Yeah I could serve kill but it's hard to pay the bill when in cuffs
So let's, flip the 5-0 until it's 0-5
Till we dictate the cost to survive
I hustle dead or alive
With the U.S. debt on the line
I wanna climb till I'm dead or resign
All I'm hearing is
"Your check bounce", a gram short of an ounce
And it's hard to pay the rent with nothin' but common sense
And since we've been dealin' with the power of the yen
We made a vow to keep hustling here until we rise up

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Myth]
My man skill on the beat
Yo I need something to eat
This hunger makes me wonder why I'm praying my soul to sleep
Threw the 20's on the Jeep
God makin' them ends meet
But I gotta produce more heat if them 20's I want to keep
So
I'd rather watch my seeds grow
Cause they foul you to shoot, call it a free throw
Knowin' a brother need doe
Blow
I'm 'bout to put the horns down
The Heavenly Father stricken me when I'm weak and when I'm torn down

[Symbolyc One]
Yo I'm stressed from the job that's got my head twisted
Livin' like I got money, I'm ballin'
Not even close y'allin'
Maxed out credit cards with a bottle full of [?]
Semi po' folks that ain't no joke
Tryin' to get my seeds some of them beautiful things
A pool in the back with a set of swings
A lot of dreams, sometimes I gotta scream
Plot and scheme ways of makin' them collared greens
Droppin' the hottest heat, rockin' the beats

I want to walk the streets without all the jealousy
So what you're selling me?
Pennies for my thoughts?
Dimes for the stress?
Incense to relax this pain up in my chest?
Bless your soul

Give me a call if you want to talk

This is the song of inspiration
For the many who have not experienced the ups and downs what is life and love
So many choices we can make
But what you need to do is take your time
And figure A through D
Or all of the above
To some my diction may sound foreign
No, I hope I ain't borin'
What I'm trying to do is fit your mental like a glove
In hopes that you might understand
That joy and pain go hand-in-hand
Until demandin' 'spect
When pushing comes down to a shove
So on this day
It's for you that I pray
That you will listen with you heart
And cast away the things that you have heard
So on this day
It's for you that I pray
That you will listen to my own
And hear a soul instead of just my words
Instead of just my words
Instead of just my words

All the time

We will give you what we came to give you
Where we gonna take you to another place where we can elevate your mind
All The Way
Girl I'm gonna make you hit your soul and make you feel it
Take you all the way inside
Baby
All The Way
Make you move it
Make you feel it
Put your hands up in the air
And let your troubles go away
We're gonna make you feel real good insidePor el rojo de la alfombra y de tus labios carmín
Por quien te obliga a ser humano y a pensar siempre en ti
Sería una pena ser ciego y no verte cuando andas
Con esas piernas tostadas al  fuego de un sol naranja
Por mí, vivo bien,no hay porque pensar que uno está loco
Porque vea colores en las bases y las notas que toco
Hay quien sacrifica todo por bolos y más
Al menos sabemos que no estamos solos

Usted sonría, quien lo diría
Si el día esta gris de apatía y de monotonía
Yo creo un sol de mediodía en apogeo
El cielo es azul creo detrás de toda esa porquería
Pinto el deseo
Rojo rubí como tu vestido o el carmesí de tu carmín
Para venirte conmigo a morir donde nací yo
Al verde y blanco andalusí mío, di que sí

Porque el futuro negro se debe a un presente gris
Por el que confía en el amarillo y se deja el orgullo en la mesita
Granate como el Soul Travellin
Esta vez es por el que no llega a fin de mes pero se invita
No me hables de altar con este morado
Encanto, mis zapatillas es lo único que veras de blanco
Esos ojazos azules que a las nubes engañan
De corazón que es pasión lo de este tango

Porque van a por ti, van de libres colocados
Amarillos del morado, atontados en su propia nube
Y no todo lo que baja luego sube
Un fallo de joven es un futuro negro que consume
Cada marrón es tu marrón y te lo comes
Disfruta si puedes, escapa a ser un guiri
Babea con tu media naranja, alimenta tu iris
Azúcar moreno para tu daiquiri
