I'm the Chill Rob G, not many are equal
To my rhymes I write my own damn sequel
I keep your mind jumping with the things I said
My talent is comeasurement with my pen
Stay the hell away if you know you're gay
Cause the game all about, I do not play
You're confused, your mind is abused, so is your body
Enough about sissies, back to the party
I'm one black man strong, will those chill
Into your head these things I want to drill
I am the Future shock, I'm here to rock your knot
The Future's here now, this ain't no pow wow
So drop the pipe, punk, you're puffing poison
Yo it's annoying, destroying my homeboys and
Girls I grew up with, I had enough of this
You try to pass me the pipe, you'll make my posse pissed
And you don't want to, I'm only warning you
Making these boys mad is something you don't wanna do
Cause they be smiling, when they be wildin'
Beating you down is like a ten man pile and
I'm cold serious, don't mess with this
Cause I'm the G and these rhymes you don't wanna miss
Dope rhymes, dope rhymes

Fresh rhymes crowd my mind, sometimes I get insomnia
I can't wait to break so I can bomb me a
Soft, silly, stupid, simple, slow dumb chump
Been sitting on his ass like and old tree stump
Compositions I design I use as a blueprint
The envious try to oppose but those who sprint with
Speed, can always tell
If a rapper is fresh or weak as hell
What I say seems to separate sucker MC's
]From the ones with the ability to build skills like these
It isn't easy, but I supply enough power
To write rhymes that wake you up like a shower
Sure you're right like dynomite I ignite on the mic
Inspiring your mind to float like a kite
To places unseen until I brought them foot
Inserted inside your skull, then you were caught
In a mental conflict, your will versus mine
Then I release you, cause I win every time
So chill back for a minute as your hear me say
I am a PG-ologist born in May
My sign is Taurus, yeah I use Lavoris
We don't listen to suckers cause you know they bore us
Dope rhymes, dope rhymes

My timing and rhyming starts you unwinding
Have you on the floor bumping and grinding
Bass from the bottom bouncing off the wall
Suckers try to run, things can't even crawl
I'm fly, flying, flew the coup
I'm going going gone and got me another
Group of admirers, female desirers
Ego boosters, rhyme inspirers
I can do anything I want to
All I have to do is put my mind to
Work jerk and go bezerk
This is a high-powered party so pump til it hurts
Cause I flirt with every skirt, forever, forever
I'm souped up to surpass in every endeavor
I challenge obsticles and oppose opposition
A mic in my hand is like the key in the ignition
Of a ??? Mercedes, this ain't play time
This is the Chill One, with the Dope Rhymes
Dope rhymes, dope rhymes

Yeah, going out to my man The 45 KingI'm dope, face it, shoot it, freebase it
Pour it in a glass, drink it, chase it
Then chill, flex ,feel the full effect
The impact is similar to a train wreck
It's wack to me when the beat is more hype than the MC
Cause what he's sayin is empty
Dull, void, without substance or content
You need to slow your speed, stop the nonsense
These are words of the rising sun surprising some
Who thought I was just another hum-drum
Average type non-mc
Who found a mic
And thought he was hype
Nah, that's not me
I'll take a page, write a phrase, then rephrase it
Treat it like a national flag and upraise it
So a nation of people can feel proud
About a brother who speaks out real loud
I'm here to rock the show
Clock the dough
And let the words flow
Flow
Flow
Flow

Enough tough talk
As a hunter I must stalk
So each day I prey
On ducks that like to play
Lame games to frame the self-same troop
Then guide em off the stoop and help them to recoup
Stone cold back biters bold wack rhyme writers
Give your little party
And now you don't know nobody
Diabolical fools persuin happiness
Likin finesse I'm left unimpressed
I heard you rhyme a few times, each time you blew it
You're soft, you can't go off, I knew it
Let's be realistic, I'm not egotistic
But you, your crew, just not that artistic
Point blank your song stank
Yo, I know you want the truth, so let's be frank
I been upstartin this art, not known for bein subtle
Patiently I listen to all types of rebuttal
"Don't say this, don't say that
Change your lyrics"
Everybody's a critic
It's gettin kinda hectic
My rhyme is authentic
So it shall remain
My writing exciting, never mundane
In actuality
My personality
Keeps my mentality
Based on real
Life situations
Not speculations
But verbal illustrations
Of how I feel
You have the audacity
To doubt my veracity
Or to insinuate the G will prevaricate
Your disposition is beyond my recognition
I fail to see the reason for your constant disbelievin
Why should I lie? What would I gain? Nothin
So when I speak yo, I don't be bluffin
I be puffin on high-powered cess blunts
I don't try to front
Or back away from a challenge, I'm game
You suckers rhymin sound like your lips are lame
You seem to need therapy for you speech impediment
Take this advice because it's for your own benefit
I'm energetic, magnetic, and athletic
One more thing, and it's called poetic
My style's unorthodox, but of course it rocks
And when it comes to styles I'm over-stocked
You might never get to hear my last rhyme
Cause I been writin since you heard me last time
I could go on
The G is strong
I rock the show
I clock the dough
And let the words flow
Flow
Flow
Flow(Baby)
(Get down)

[ VERSE 1 ]
The truth will set you free, let you see the light
You don't need to watch TV tonight
And stop talkin while I'm speakin or start walkin
Coke you're smokin got you gaggin and coughin
It's a beacon of light that I present
Illuminatin the mic with common sense
I profile the style of the Chill one
Now close your eyes, son, cause I'm the rising sun
Back up, don't sweat me, let me earn my pay
People fiendin for funky tracks we lay
Need I say I built my rep on
The fact when others turned back I kept on
Rhymin, climbin, the timin, the fist fighter
All you crumb snatchers, I'm here to diss biters
I don't trust you any further than I can throw you
You have any doubts? Look, let me show you

[ VERSE 2 ]
What type of thing are you into? These rhymes I'm bringin you
Are sort of like slingin you, I'll tell you a thing or two
I see what's in front of me, the G is no wanna-be
I hope you know this ain't as hype as it's gonna be
I know I'm original, the G is no criminal
Never switchin position cause the condition is terminal
I do what I gotta do like a brother's supposed to
I'm livin my life right like I took an oath to
I'm pushin my way through, I won't let you slow me down
Chill is a prefix, Rob is a proper noun
G is for greatness, I don't wanna debate this
The way that I'm risin I appear to be weightless
I may sound crazy, this might look easy
Suckers don't faze me, crabs don't skeeze me
You wanna know the time, then bust a rhyme
Here's my favorite line - let me show you

[ VERSE 3 ]
I hear a lot of rappers who seem to lackluster
Execute your rhyme with all the force that you can muster
Just a hint, as I sprint toward my own goal
Rob is chill, got skill and get stone-cold
But I'm a free thinker, I'll tinker with your brain game
More when I put you on board my thought train
All aboard, you can all applaud, and Lord
Have pity on a fake or flake or fraud
Think you're cool? What a fool we take you for
Wastin time on rhymes that make you snore
Puttin yourself to sleep is ridiculous
To shake you up, wake you up, we kick you this
Seems like you get up and go, got up and left
Now just watchin me you're all out of breath
Sit down, relax yourself, don't tax yourself
Here's a pretty good question to ask yourself
Am I lackin, how am I livin, am I givin all I got?
If not, let me show youHere's a prognotion, stop the commotion, I'll have my dose in
We cruising, the beat and bruising, you need coaxing
Fluid as I do it, the motion is similar to the ocean
Bringing waves of emotion
This feeling, that I'm dealing, is so appealing
It's shocking, look how I got you rocking and reeling
My ripple and rhythm is reminicent of a river when it's pouring
The King is reigning, I'm pouring
This music, yeah he can use it, but don't abuse it
Move it, you said you were a dancer, prove it
I was full of powerful percussion get you rushing on line
When it's 45 King time
Master of the Game, marks his fame, Mark's his name
The 45 King is the self same
Man who made the music that matched with the lesson
When I said "Court is in Session"
Feel it, ride the rhythm

Rhythms, I can get paid just for riding 'em
Suckers seem to be afraid cause I'm sliding 'em
Riding 'em, cold dividing 'em when I cut 'em up
Hit 'em with speed, they don't know who, why, when, where, what
Word is weird when your song is wrong
On the strength, I go the length, cause I'm long and strong
Freedom of choice lets me greet 'em with a forceful voice
So they know, I ain't no oreo
I'm solid, all the way through, what's up with you?
My cup runneth over, here's a drop or two
Rob is a roller, a writer, a schooler
And when it comes to gold then I'm a jewler
Feel it, ride the rhythm

My rhyme collection's under protection so now I'm flexing
We ruling, that's how we cooling, and how we plexing
What'll we do next, you'll probably never guess
Flavor Unit MC's are the cleverest
I'm sleek, think on my feet, rock to a beat
In my brain, I'm not insane, and never weak
When you're read to rock to raw rhythms, reach for my record
This I perfected, and you can check it
Listen, I'm in position, to start dissing
Instead I use my head to stay fed
Never starving Mastercharging past the margin
Whatever price you paid, it was a bargain
Freedom is priceless, knowledge is twice that
That goes for everybody, Latin, white, black
Depends on who you are and how you living
But in the meantime, just ride the rhythm

Muscleheads on a mission cold be wishing they be flipping
This passion, I'm not asking, I'm just whipping
I'm real, and I'm the deal, so how you feel?
You beg, borrow, or steal, you got appeal
Step off, get lost, or get tossed
Like a salad, your rhymes has no value
An invalid waste of breath, a taste of death is all that's left
When I get these rhymes off my chest
Indeed, I have exceeded, what you expected
You know that I'm dope, but can you accept it?
There's no doubt about the clout that I rap
To make sure everything turns out
Perfect, as close as we can work it, to perfection
Fly girls, they give me an erection
Plexing, something that I do with the Flavor U
By the way, that's my family, too
Feel it, ride the rhythmYo look, you're in my way, I'm tellin you to back up
You think this is a game, so I'll commence to rack up
Points like the pro that I know that I am
Break on the mic, then go for the slam
You can't slow me down, talk about stop me
The best that you can do is try to copy
The rhythm of the stylish on the Wild Pitch label
I'm able to bust a fat cable
Kids can't cope, you call it a rope
Lookin straight in my face yet the image is kaleidoscope
Due to the drugs you're takin your brain is fakin
Stop and take note of the mistakes you're makin
( ? ) pebble
Callin me brother but you're not on my level
I'm too much in effect, too much self-respect
I'm too live to ever drive my life to a wreck
I break necks, cash checks, have sex and plex
Do a battle in a flash then ask who's next
I'm a survivor kickin liver than a Memorex
Stompin out competition like Tyranosaurus Rex
I'm master-educatin, you masturbatin
Traps for weak raps, you need to be slapped
You suck ( ? ) your baseball cap
From now on wear a beanie, stop chasin the genie
I rather chase a cutie in a teenie bikini
Sip Martinis on the rocks to keep it cold
Then chase it down with a quart of Olde Gold
The Chill will fill you with the weapon of wisdom
I master creation, never plagiarism
Offer me a blast, you must be jokin
Let my posse find out, your butt will really be smokin
This cat is courageous, outrageous, contagious
Most DJ's say they can't wait to play this
On a plate or platter made from wax
You wanna hear me chit-chatter, then pay the tax
Even on cassette I make suckers sweat
And the wack are afraid of me cause I'm a threat
Yes, you're all wet, caught up in my net
But I'll let you go, there's no need to fret
It's time to rewind, so go head, flick the switch
It's fat, catch it - Wild PitchWhat is life, what is competition
What is Rob but a true musician
What are new jacks lacking, facts, but new edition
Instead of the editor of fat rhyme classics
Now I'm some trick bastard who needs his ass kicked
They play me like a vic, who should be home raising kids
Instead of running across the stage screaming "There it is"
I try to check my rage, act my age
Keep the personal shit off the stage, it's impossible
There's lots of bull, Hip Hop is full of bullshit artists
Offer nothing but crap, and keep their pockets full
The world is full of round holes these are square pegs
With rhyme skills about as sharp as a boiled egg
I lay you flat on your back get the best of y'all
I've got the fat that kills quicker than cholesterol
It's heart-stopping, chart-topping
How could you say you're hot shit, you're not even bird dropping

[Hook]
Do you like what I do when I do what I do
It feel funky to me, is it funky for you
True, true, I'm still banging, eff you
Now tell me what you plan to do, let me know something

I go from night until day
Creams scorching them playthings badly
Ready to kill when you mistake the Chill for Milton Bradley
Darker brother than a Parker Brother, chain-smoking rappers
Before I'm through with you I'm gonna spark another
You want sweet, see Willy Wonka, I'm tougher than Tonka
The way I roll they say I'm out of control
Violent, screaming, with my ears steaming, spinning like a demon
I'm harder to hold back than semen
Silent, deadly when I'm creeping
I'm worse than Freddy Krueger cause I'm real
I'll get you while you're sleeping
I ain't never been a fan of yours
If I make you listen check it twice, I'm like an evil Santa Claus
And I ain't bringing no gifts and toys
I got a bag full of hard times, black eyes, and mad noise
Recognize what I'm saying, before we get you
There ain't nobody from Chilltown playing with you

[Hook]Never feeling insignificant, I can make a difference
You need an example, use this as a for instance
Put your mouth on pause, put your brain in gear
Alley-oop, sassafrass, raise your glass and cheer
As you get on your good foot, I hope that you never put
Your trust in unjust suckers who discuss
Ways of getting paid by criminal means
They're having a sale on minimal dreams
Doomed to fail, they caught your tail
Your butt's in jail, you gets no bail
The scale was tipped, but you weighed little
There's a rock and a hard place, you're caught in the middle
Need a lawyer to litigate some legal dribble
Now you're back on the streets like it ain't no riddle
How ling will this last, you seem to love crime
Today you're out here, tomorrow you do time
Word is bond, arm your brain and shoot
Yo, the state is cold ready to prosecute
Oh you think you're smarter, the system's older
The ace has been dealt, you're now the holder
The name is Chill Rob, there is a good God
My rep is not scarred, I won't commit fraud
Can't say I lied, there's nothing to hide
I say with much pride "Court is Now in Session"

Friday night we out playing the corner
Not because we hoods, cause we wanna
No drugs being sold, we ain't dirty
Polaroids in effect, watch the birdie
Turned around, heard the sounds of sirens
The boys, they collared me, asked me where I'd been
I told them that I was right here all night
Looking at each other they smiled and said "All right
You think you're smart, you wanna be tough
Get your ass in the car, you're coming with us"
I said "To where, for what? I ain't guilty
My name is Rob G., you just can't bilk me"
Now I'm sitting in a courtroom all day
I claim I'm innocent but that's what they all say
But to my brothers lined up in the hallway
Take in the type of price I might have to pay
And finally the crime held jails me
Seems I'm made to escape the daily
Routine I'm too clean you got nothing on me
Arrest that sucker for being so corny
I'll run the truth, make it plain and simple
Got popped by big shots as big as a pimple
Snatch him off the street drop him in the can
Chain him like an animal, forget he's a man
This might be a little raw for some to eat
But this is food for thought that I speak
If you can't stand the heat, I think you know the rest
This is live, not a test, court is in session

It's a pity the way the city treats the poor
I got congressmen, councilmen - tell me, what are they for?
I write letters, or better, I even give them a call
But they kick back, cool out in my city hall
I pay the tax, they max, but they ain't passing off
They try to beat me, they treat me like they think that I'm soft
Pure power, the hour is later than you think
While they're sleeping I'm creeping because I'm on the brink
Of insanity, vanity keeps my hygiene clean
Stop dissing, listen and you'll know what I mean
It's not mystery, history keeps repeating itself
I last longer, I'm stronger, my rhyme's completing itself
I put the pen to the pad and let the words flow
I put the mic to my mouth to make your mind grow
So nighty-nighty alrighty, I'm putting heads to bed
You sound tired, you're fired up over what I said
There's no stopping I'm cold dropping you toy boys
No bull, I'm hitting you with the dope noise
Court is in session...Never feeling insignificant, I can make a difference
You need an example, use this as a for instance
Put your mouth on pause, put your brain in gear
Alley-oop, sassafrass, raise your glass and cheer

I'm Chill, bust it, no need to discuss it
I made the record rough so you could rush it
So spin it, play it, memorize it, say it
My rhyme is law, the beat obeys it
Rob the roller to break the boulder
There's four aces and I'm the holder
My song will pump right because I'm trump tight
I got it customized, go fly a kite
I'll take the weight when the records break
And why try to analyze and listen for little mistakes
"Yo, he don't sound right"
Look, be outta here 'fore I beat you with the mic
Honeys are horny, they all up on me
I didn't see em comin and nobody warned me
But I'm not John and I don't pay to play
I just rock the box from day to day
The mind conceives it, Rob can achieve it
If I give you should wanna receive it
Live a little, let yourself loose
What you're slowin down? You must need a boost
From the bass, not the pipe type
That's too damn hype for me
What I like to see
Is people gettin busy
Till they're damn near dizzy
Turn it, churn it, twist it, lift it and shake it
You know what? We can make it

[ VERSE 2 ]
Scooboolywawawa, contact
Went halfway around the world, then I came back
Chillin in Tokyo, London and Amsterdam
People pack the parties we jam
I see the world cause I'm an MC
While you join the army and be all you can be
I mean all they let you
But how can I sweat you?
Go ahead and step to
Whatever you think is right, it's your life
I ain't with it cause I'm not the type
Now back to what's at hand, here we stand
I got the mic so I'm the man
Timin in rhymin, that's the key
Writin rhymes about things that I do and I see
Or have seen, see what I'm sayin is my deep insight
Helps me out a whole lot when it's time to write
My manuscript's made for musical merger
Livin like a trooper, spendin like a splurger
Drugs don't excite, that's not my appetite
The money, the money, it gives me delight
I like to hold it, fold it, put it in my pocket
And close em up to make sure I don't drop it
I'm not needy, greedy, cheap or tight
But nothin on the planet is free, am I right?
Since I'm givin it, you should take it

Verse

(Bust it...now)

This is a matter of utmost urgency
You might even call it a police emergency
Suckers got ill when they finally heard the G
Wasn't sellin' out, they tried to murder me
Reached for my jammy like a troop's supposed to do
Never let a sucker get too close to you
Heard 'em comin', ducked behind the wall
Then saw the whites of his eyes, the first one had to fall
Another bug creeped up the fire escape
Trying to sneak, I guess he snuck too late
Lookin' like a scene from Real Life Vice
The way his head fell apart like a block of solid ice
Uzi does it, come to think of it
Dude had a nine, but his wasn't as fast as mine
I heard the phone ring, should I answer?
This is gettin' serious as terminal cancer
And that is the final stage, my primal rage
Began to rise and I started to fantasize
How many more might try to rush the door
And blast their way in, hell, I ain't stayin'
I opened the back door and felt the summer night heat
Saw a bunch of bugs wearin' white sheets
What else could it mean? I know it ain't Halloween
The cross in the background burnin' made a ill scene
First I was panicky, then I was angry
One creep even had a rope ready to hang me
Now who am I supposed to be? Eddie Spaghetti?
You come and vic Rob G any time you're ready?
Fuck that, they had me trapped so I rushed back
They tried to bust me but they don't have enough caps
I dipped, dived, slipped, slid, they missed me
I had to move quick or they was bound to get me
One bullet grazed me, that didn't phase me
What could I say? I was havin' a fucked up day
Stood up and took aim, my finger on the trigger
I shouted "Now let me hear you say nigger!"
Well anyway, nobody spoke or went for broke
The place was all clouded up from gunsmoke
And everything got quiet, I don't buy it
Just a second ago we had a riot
They must be plannin' attack or settin' a trap
Whatever the case you won't get this black
Now I'm on the edge and there's no denyin' it
Whatever the hell might work I'm tryin' it
Thought I was a target that they could get right quick
But I ain't goin' out like no statistic
Another number, made me wonder
How many other brothers they've put under
I sat in the dark real still for a long time
Didn't make a sound cos I've got a strong mind
Made my way to the street, it was daybreak
Must've fallen asleep, but for Pete's sake
I didn't see the enemy tryin' to put an end to me
The night before, my finger trigger was sore
I went in the house to get a fresh clip
And then I woke up an' shit...

Guess I was just buggin' or somethin', man...)Artist: Chill Rob G

Song:   Future Shock

Verse 1

My word's food for thought, the mind is like a cafeteria
Some rappers are inferior, but none are superior
My voice is choice, I'm one of the chosen
I might be Chill, but I'm not frozen
Self-preservation, survival of the better
Chill Rob plus the seventh letter
Flyin' off at every angle, can you tangle
Mix or handle, you don't hold a candle
To what you're hearin', you don't have a near win
But it's a clear miss, no wonder you fear this
And don't get pissed just because I riffed
I'll tell you what, smoke this:
I'm the Future Shock...

Verse 2

The man, the moment, the mic, the muscle
The power, the people, the hype, the hustle
The harder I hit, the smarter you get
If you're a liar, stay away cos I ain't shovellin' shit
The edge of night opens doorways to horror
I'm the guiding light as you search for tomorrow
Dark shadows terrorize the young and restless
I'll crash the spot if I'm not on the guest list
The hands of time in my mind advances fast
While you recite the first to the last
Word that I spoke, but no, that's no complaint
Take my rhyme but use restraint
If I catch you on the perpetratin' tip, hurtin' your lip
Well look, you know how it is, I gotta flip
In ways you would never suspect
Like do a front semi and land on your neck
To be precise, correct and exact
This album is mostly freestyle and feedback
From the people, it's the sequel
To 'Dope Rhymes', but this is go for broke time
Without breakin', makin' no mistakes and
Takin' no flakes for friends, cos in the end
They backbite, and you don't wanna get smacked, right?
So hold tight while your mind takes flight
Check out a verse or two and see if I can rock
I'm the Future Shock...

Verse 3

Nothin' better to do, so I'll persue this new
Style, rhythm rockin' and poppin' lip
Jealous punks pretend it ain't hype but in
Ten lines or less they're jockin' it
Reality is my beat, the beat goes on
Mark creates the beat that Rob rolls on
Like a musical note or a boat ridin' a wave
And I hope what I wrote goes with you to your grave
Save a little for later so I can come back
My lyrics stick in your brain like a thumbtack
And if you thought I was slummin', wrong
You know that I'm comin' strong
This is a Flavorized drum track
So take a stand and plan to upraise your hand
When you agree what I'm speakin' is purely truth
I rap the style of rhyme that opens up your mind
To the way things have been since my youth
Why am I riffin'? Just listen and see if I can rock
While you be-bop to breaks I drop
I'm the Future ShockWhat is life, what is competition
What is Rob but a true musician
What are new jacks lacking, facts, but new edition
Instead of the editor of fat rhyme classics
Now I'm some trick bastard who needs his ass kicked
They play me like a vic, who should be home raising kids
Instead of running across the stage screaming "There it is"
I try to check my rage, act my age
Keep the personal shit off the stage, it's impossible
There's lots of bull, Hip Hop is full of bullshit artists
Offer nothing but crap, and keep their pockets full
The world is full of round holes these are square pegs
With rhyme skills about as sharp as a boiled egg
I lay you flat on your back get the best of y'all
I've got the fat that kills quicker than cholesterol
It's heart-stopping, chart-topping
How could you say you're hot shit, you're not even bird dropping

[Hook]
Do you like what I do when I do what I do
It feel funky to me, is it funky for you
True, true, I'm still banging, eff you
Now tell me what you plan to do, let me know something

I go from night until day
Creams scorching them playthings badly
Ready to kill when you mistake the Chill for Milton Bradley
Darker brother than a Parker Brother, chain-smoking rappers
Before I'm through with you I'm gonna spark another
You want sweet, see Willy Wonka, I'm tougher than Tonka
The way I roll they say I'm out of control
Violent, screaming, with my ears steaming, spinning like a demon
I'm harder to hold back than semen
Silent, deadly when I'm creeping
I'm worse than Freddy Krueger cause I'm real
I'll get you while you're sleeping
I ain't never been a fan of yours
If I make you listen check it twice, I'm like an evil Santa Claus
And I ain't bringing no gifts and toys
I got a bag full of hard times, black eyes, and mad noise
Recognize what I'm saying, before we get you
There ain't nobody from Chilltown playing with you

[Hook](Baby)
(Get down)

[ VERSE 1 ]
The truth will set you free, let you see the light
You don't need to watch TV tonight
And stop talkin while I'm speakin or start walkin
Coke you're smokin got you gaggin and coughin
It's a beacon of light that I present
Illuminatin the mic with common sense
I profile the style of the Chill one
Now close your eyes, son, cause I'm the rising sun
Back up, don't sweat me, let me earn my pay
People fiendin for funky tracks we lay
Need I say I built my rep on
The fact when others turned back I kept on
Rhymin, climbin, the timin, the fist fighter
All you crumb snatchers, I'm here to diss biters
I don't trust you any further than I can throw you
You have any doubts? Look, let me show you

[ VERSE 2 ]
What type of thing are you into? These rhymes I'm bringin you
Are sort of like slingin you, I'll tell you a thing or two
I see what's in front of me, the G is no wanna-be
I hope you know this ain't as hype as it's gonna be
I know I'm original, the G is no criminal
Never switchin position cause the condition is terminal
I do what I gotta do like a brother's supposed to
I'm livin my life right like I took an oath to
I'm pushin my way through, I won't let you slow me down
Chill is a prefix, Rob is a proper noun
G is for greatness, I don't wanna debate this
The way that I'm risin I appear to be weightless
I may sound crazy, this might look easy
Suckers don't faze me, crabs don't skeeze me
You wanna know the time, then bust a rhyme
Here's my favorite line - let me show you

[ VERSE 3 ]
I hear a lot of rappers who seem to lackluster
Execute your rhyme with all the force that you can muster
Just a hint, as I sprint toward my own goal
Rob is chill, got skill and get stone-cold
But I'm a free thinker, I'll tinker with your brain game
More when I put you on board my thought train
All aboard, you can all applaud, and Lord
Have pity on a fake or flake or fraud
Think you're cool? What a fool we take you for
Wastin time on rhymes that make you snore
Puttin yourself to sleep is ridiculous
To shake you up, wake you up, we kick you this
Seems like you get up and go, got up and left
Now just watchin me you're all out of breath
Sit down, relax yourself, don't tax yourself
Here's a pretty good question to ask yourself
Am I lackin, how am I livin, am I givin all I got?
If not, let me show youMy rhymes as I kick them leave you victim to the beat
I'm advancin, people dancin in the street
To my drum, more wise words from the Chill one
You felt the effect in the past and you're still numb
Leavin you bugs in the dust is a must for me
Silly you clowns gather round and discuss the G
Wonderin' which move I might make next
I'm stackin my rhymes so I climb to the apex
Why should I wait for a date with destiny?
I'll pick the time, the place that's best for me
Don't bother tryin' to block or hold me back
Advancement is my mind's only track
I'm an aristocrat, a ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with a gift for rap
So I'm shootin my mouth off cause suckers are shootable
Flauntin my flesh cause I'm black and it's beautiful
Many have fallen from bein too careless
It pays to raise your cultural awareness
Know who you are, where you're goin and where you came from
Breakin your neck for respect, man, that's plain dumb
Respect is somethin you gain by bein yourself
Otherwise we're respectin somebody else
The person you wanna be, not who you really are
Yo, can you follow me, or did I just go too far?
I don't wanna confuse y'all, so just get on board
And walk this way, cause I'm movin forward
Advancin, swift is how I move
Before I grip the mic I calm my mood
Let me activate, I'm an activist
You wanna rap? Develop an knack for this
Learn to use your head, got to be more careful
Be doin nothin stupid cause somebody dared you
I'm an ear full, an eyeful, an arrival
Givin you back what you lack for survival
Into rappin, it just so happens that I'm a Black man
Rob is chill, got skill and I pack jams
Rhymes I wrote I devote to promote pride
People can quote what I spoke cause I don't lie
My records do not slip, skip and they won't slide
This jam was made by the King and I
Mark's remarkable, bass shakes the floor board
The whole place vibrates while I'm movin forward
Out of my way, you seen my comin
Drop from the sky and I hit the ground runnin
No confusion or complication
The name is still Chill Rob and this groove is MotivationHere's a prognotion, stop the commotion, I'll have my dose in
We cruising, the beat and bruising, you need coaxing
Fluid as I do it, the motion is similar to the ocean
Bringing waves of emotion
This feeling, that I'm dealing, is so appealing
It's shocking, look how I got you rocking and reeling
My ripple and rhythm is reminicent of a river when it's pouring
The King is reigning, I'm pouring
This music, yeah he can use it, but don't abuse it
Move it, you said you were a dancer, prove it
I was full of powerful percussion get you rushing on line
When it's 45 King time
Master of the Game, marks his fame, Mark's his name
The 45 King is the self same
Man who made the music that matched with the lesson
When I said "Court is in Session"
Feel it, ride the rhythm

Rhythms, I can get paid just for riding 'em
Suckers seem to be afraid cause I'm sliding 'em
Riding 'em, cold dividing 'em when I cut 'em up
Hit 'em with speed, they don't know who, why, when, where, what
Word is weird when your song is wrong
On the strength, I go the length, cause I'm long and strong
Freedom of choice lets me greet 'em with a forceful voice
So they know, I ain't no oreo
I'm solid, all the way through, what's up with you?
My cup runneth over, here's a drop or two
Rob is a roller, a writer, a schooler
And when it comes to gold then I'm a jewler
Feel it, ride the rhythm

My rhyme collection's under protection so now I'm flexing
We ruling, that's how we cooling, and how we plexing
What'll we do next, you'll probably never guess
Flavor Unit MC's are the cleverest
I'm sleek, think on my feet, rock to a beat
In my brain, I'm not insane, and never weak
When you're read to rock to raw rhythms, reach for my record
This I perfected, and you can check it
Listen, I'm in position, to start dissing
Instead I use my head to stay fed
Never starving Mastercharging past the margin
Whatever price you paid, it was a bargain
Freedom is priceless, knowledge is twice that
That goes for everybody, Latin, white, black
Depends on who you are and how you living
But in the meantime, just ride the rhythm

Muscleheads on a mission cold be wishing they be flipping
This passion, I'm not asking, I'm just whipping
I'm real, and I'm the deal, so how you feel?
You beg, borrow, or steal, you got appeal
Step off, get lost, or get tossed
Like a salad, your rhymes has no value
An invalid waste of breath, a taste of death is all that's left
When I get these rhymes off my chest
Indeed, I have exceeded, what you expected
You know that I'm dope, but can you accept it?
There's no doubt about the clout that I rap
To make sure everything turns out
Perfect, as close as we can work it, to perfection
Fly girls, they give me an erection
Plexing, something that I do with the Flavor U
By the way, that's my family, too
Feel it, ride the rhythmYo look, you're in my way, I'm tellin you to back up
You think this is a game, so I'll commence to rack up
Points like the pro that I know that I am
Break on the mic, then go for the slam
You can't slow me down, talk about stop me
The best that you can do is try to copy
The rhythm of the stylish rapper on the Wild Pitch label
I'm able to bust a fat cable
Kids can't cope, you call it a rope
Lookin straight in my face yet the image is kaleidoscope
Due to the drugs you're takin your brain is fakin
Stop and take note of the mistakes you're makin
( ? ) pebble
Callin me brother but you're not on my level
I'm too much in effect, too much self-respect
I'm too live to ever drive my life to a wreck
I break necks, cash checks, have sex and plex
Do a battle in a flash then ask who's next
I'm a survivor kickin liver than a Memorex
Stompin out competition like Tyranosaurus Rex
I'm master-educatin, you masturbatin
Traps for weak raps, you need to be slapped
You suck ( ? ) your baseball cap
From now on wear a beanie, stop chasin the genie
I rather chase a cutie in a teenie bikini
Sip Martinis on the rocks to keep it cold
Then chase it down with a quart of Olde Gold
The Chill will fill you with the weapon of wisdom
I master creation, never plagiarism
Offer me a blast, you must be jokin
Let my posse find out, your butt will really be smokin
This cat is courageous, outrageous, contagious
Most DJ's say they can't wait to play this
On a plate or platter made from wax
You wanna hear me chit-chatter, then pay the tax
Even on cassette I make suckers sweat
And the wack are afraid of me cause I'm a threat
Yes, you're all wet, caught up in my net
But I'll let you go, there's no need to fret
It's time to rewind, so go head, flick the switch
It's fat, catch it - Wild PitchYo look, you're in my way, I'm tellin you to back up
