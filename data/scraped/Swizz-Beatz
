[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding, Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'mma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty-thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Hook]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30
Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by 21
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Cyhi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Hook: RZA]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know the shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous

[Bridge][Produced by Swizz Beatz and Noah "40" Shebib]

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nail done, hair done, everything did

[Verse 1: Drake]
You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Well, aren’t you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like voila, you do it right he might just buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I’m buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Beamer
Champagne Range, Triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti

[Hook]

[Interlude: Drake]
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

[Hook][Produced by S1 and Swizz Beatz]

["Murder"]
[Intro: Jay-Z]
Bloody murder, murder, murder

[Hook: Kanye]
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I’m out here fighting for you, don’t increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Kanye]
And I’m from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye]
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain’t got enough room for all the tombs
It’s a war going on outside we ain’t safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

[Jay-Z]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I’m out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It’s all black, I love us

[Hook]

["Excellence" (produced by S1)]

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
It’s a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I’m present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I “shh-shh”
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What’s up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain’t enough.. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I’m all dressed up with nowhere to go

[Verse 4: Kanye]
Yeah it’s all messed up when it’s nowhere to go
So we won’t take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G’s, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG’s
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What’s the life expectancy for black guys?
The system’s working effectively, that’s why!
I’ll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain’t nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain’t nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let’s savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours[Hook: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, all we do is just reach here
Raised round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo moulin rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (Wooo!)
They love me on my Ric Flair shit (Wooo!)
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (Wooo!)
Who are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
Raah, I make these mothafuckas hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posing for them pics so you can upload
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga

[Hook][Produced by Swizz Beatz]

[Intro : Ab-Soul]
Yeah, see I know I can make a lot of money doing this man
It's just the whole process that uh...
That I'm having trouble with know what I mean
I know you just pretty much, you know
Get the water boiling and just uh get a jar or something like that
Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Shame on him! (what?)
Lemme put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
First you bargain shop
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay
Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no
Drop four grand
This is LA man
Unless it be a drought
But homie if it ain't
Then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
That's a whole other story though
Back to the lesson
Hope you're takin' down your footnotes
Class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
Say you'll get it baby just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft (good)
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
How ironic...hmm
Like most of you rappers

[Outro]
Aw I don't believe that man
You're too professional with it man
There's NO way you've never done it before, know what I mean
That was too descriptive["Under the spot, under the spot" - *repeat in background*]

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
I got a million ways to get it (uh-huh, geah)
... Choose one (choose one, hey)
Ay, bring it back, bring it back (uh-huh)
Now double your money and make a stack
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
(Hold up) Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey

[Verse 1]
Hov' on that new shit, niggas like "How come?"
Niggas want my old shit, buy my old albums
Niggas stuck on stupid, I gotta keep it movin'
Niggas make the same shit, me I make The Blueprint
Came in the Range, hopped out the Lexus
Every year since, I been on that next shit
Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolexes
Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records
Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner
Now I rock a tailored suit, lookin like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas, Brother I'm a grown up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones
I move onward, the only direction
Can't be scared to fail in the search of perfection
Gotta keep it fresh girl, even when we sexin
But don't be mad at him when it's on to the next one

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck a throwback jersey cause we on to the next one
And fuck that Auto-Tune cause we *onnnnn*
And niggas don't be mad cause it's all about progression
Loiterers should be arrested
I used to drink Cristal, the muh'fucker's racist
So I switched gold bottles on to that Spade shit
You gon' have another drink or you just gon' baby-sit
On to the next one, somebody call the waitress
Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
I don't get dropped, I drop the label
World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen
Niggas in the same spot, me I'm dodgin raindrops
Meanin I'm on vacay, chillin on a big yacht
Yeah I got on flip-flops, white Louie boat shoes
Y'all should grow the fuck up, c'mere let me coach you
Hold up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uhh, Big Pimpin' in the house now
Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down
Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off
Ride clean, I don't ever take the shoes off
Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off
Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard
Navigation on, tryin to find my next thrill
Feelin myself, I don't even need an X pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin in the projects
Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin on the steps
Drinkin quarter waters, I gotta be the best
M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text
Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next
Hold up

[Hook][Hook]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a FOOL
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 1: DMX]
If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight
There go the gun click, nine one one shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight Slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin on your back, lookin at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin the truth and it hurts

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DMX]
Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
Cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a ho
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, MAN

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
I bring down rains so heavy it hurts the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walkin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Push like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'mma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin' his mouth, I'mma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you, who, some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

[Hook]

[DMX]
One.. two.. meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my Ruff Ry-DERS gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my big ball-ERS gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside

Break fools that act like they ain't knowin how it's goin

Unmask that kid, look at that bastard kid
That don't mind having to break shit or take shit
And motherfucker, if you ain't me you ain't shit
You fuckin faggot
You know I coulda been stuck it to you
Nigga I wasn't even think about fuckin wit you
But I bet now I know your man is thinkin twice bout who to fuck wit
Shit is gettin bad, I'm robbin niggas I grew up with
And I know it's just a matter of time before I get shot
Or I'ma torture this niggas little sister and make him watch
Give a nigga a little room, now he's tryin to house shit
But I bet you get back on some mouse shit
When I punch you in your mouth, bitch
Aaaah, a nigga broken off quick
Yelllckkk!(gagging sound), is the sound he makes chockin off dick
How you feel, eatin with a straw he has to suck through
Fuck me? No fuck you, now I gotta touch you
Fuckin bitch suckin dick like a jockstrap
Put them Glocks back
Tryin to be the first punk motherfucker that shot back
Got that? Didn't Get? You know where you gonna be layin right?
I'm tellin you, hah, you know what the fuck I'm sayin right?
You will respect this, cuz it gets reckless when I cut the
Dun-nun-Dun-nun-Dun-nun-Dun-nun, you be like "What the--Nooo!"
But it's too late cuz the heat-seaker done found the heat
The concrete done found your meat
Cuz hittin the ground still hot from steam comin off
Eyes rolled back in his head, coughin up chunks of flesh
Then niggas'll roll with his monstrous death, beatin punks to death
Ain't nuthin left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
You up in the casket with some shades, cuz your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did
Now you want peace? Well take a piece of this ammunition
And get your ass drug out the Hudson by some old man fishin
My mission is almost complete
This message will self distruct in two seconds
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep[Hook]
[Swizz Beatz] (3x)
Aim for the head
When you see 'em go get 'em nigga

Yo Cass' lets they ass know you ain't playin' wit 'em

Yo game let them lames know you ain't playin' wit 'em

[The Game]

Bought a .45 put the barrel on the window
It's me and Swizzle fo' shizzle

Cock it back if you carry a missle
Can't cross both of your arms, nigga fold em back
If you miss Soulja Slim do the Nolia Clap
Or recline the seats in the rover back
Yeah it's me and young Cass' 'til Hov come back
You wanna see us both dead, then load your gat
You be the first nigga to bring penny loafers back
Why niggas wanna see me R-I-P
Empty the clip in a nigga before I D-I-E
Prayin on my downfall like B-I-G
I be in the cockpit ridin dirty like T-I-P
Po-po pull me over wanna see I-D
Searchin my shit tryin to find my 3 times 3
They don't know I got 4 times 4 in the backseat
Wit enough bodies on it to get a nigga 5 times 5
Other niggas snitch on em
Like if he got the rover parked crooked in the front
He might have bricks on em
I'll send a lil' back like the brother of Rich Porter
Run up on you and give you a buck fifty like six quarters
Yeah

[Cassidy]
Shit real, I know how baggin a whole brick feel
Big deal, hit the garage and switch wheels
My chicks real, with the ménage and tip drills
Gimme a massage, yeah show me how them lips feel
I shinin' cause I'm grindin' on the strip still
And I grip steel, still keep the clips still
Everything I spit real
Everything I spit ill
Everything I spit sick, for real ain't shit switch
Ain't shit changed, like Rick James I'm rich bitch
Get change big chain the wrist glist
I'm with Game, I'mma make cake like bisquick
My album went gold in a month, that was a quick flip
Dont say shit bitch, cause niggas wit the lip get
Er'y one in the gun til it go click click
Then I'mma switch clips and squeeze like toothpaste
Palm over my forearm so I can shoot straight
I'm 'bout to make it hard to eat like toothaches
My flow dope like I go in the booth and shoot base
Duece duece the skates in the coupe great
Im not broke I cop coke by the suitcase
My boots laced I got base and them white ki's
'Bout to cop a convertible crib, like Ice-T's
And that ice on your sleeve thats light cheese
I spend a 100 g's a year on white tees

[Cassidy]
Shit real, I know how baggin a whole brick feel
Big deal, hit the garage and switch wheels
My chicks real, with the menage and tip drills
Give me a massage, then show me how them lips feel
I'm shinin cause I'm clinin on the strip still
And I grip steel, still keep the clip steel
Everything I spit real, everything I spit ill
Everything spit sick, for real
When shit switch, ain't shit changed
Like Rick James, I'm rich bitch
Get change, big chain and wrist gliss
I'm with game, I'mma make cake like this quick
My album went gold in a month, that was a quick flip
Don't say shit bitch, cause niggas with the lip bit
Ain't one in the gun, 'till it go click click
Then I'm gon'switch clips and squeeze like toothpaste
Palm over my forearm so I could shoot straight

[Hook]

[Jin]
My objective is to live lavish, rip mad kids
Jin stand out like Swiss ad libs
Compared to me, your shit's average, no matter how you come
Should've been spit on volume one, tell your corner it's time
Throw in the towel, you done
Call up Jimmy, Kevin Lyles, whoever you want
It's a wrap, your career can not be saved
Fuck makin a comeback, you ain't Flavor Flav
Before my album dropped, I rocked show for G's
Blowin trees, while I'm tourin overseas
Flew to PR, won a quick fifty G's
And I'm still poppin up on Smack DVD's
Ain't got no platinum plaques for records sold
But if eatin rappers was sales, I'm seven times gold
Bout to blow, get set for detonation
Speakin on behalf of the next generation

[Hook]
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga
Let them lames know you ain't playin with 'em

[J-Hood]
No matter what they spit, I still ain't convinced
Not at all, your brains over the window, make it look like you got red tints
Hope your GT got a bulletproof F-R-O-N-T
Pop with them slugs and give a fuck about your Bentley
You a punk and I'm a boss boy
It's the U Cheeks and I ain't talkin bout that nigga from the Lost Boys
The barrel was too big, you had to see the fall
You had to see that havin it all was just a casualty of war
I got keys like a cord when I'm swingin a sword
I could bring you the law, got them things on the fog
We the best and I ain't got to spit a punchline
Cause I do situps all over the track when it's crunchtime
Fuck this rap shit, I've been realer, you got thin scrilla
I'll put this machette through the side of your chin chilla
Black hoodie with the matchin fitted
Don't come up short lil' man, we even clappin midgets

[Hook]

[Hook - DMX]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas you just don't know
But niggas is about to go oh no oh no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo mind, I don't know why

What the fuck is you niggas pressin me for
I saw more ass than a ho and you stressin the raw
If I was testin your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me cuz you dont even know me
Nigga check me (come on)
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin
Red dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin
Bad decisions lead to last decisions
Fast collision, now yo ass is missin (what)
Take it over there now you bring it back to the streets
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?
Let me break it down for you he's about to attack you
Still standin here faggot? You must want me to smack you
You ain't been there or done that, fuck is y'all niggas tellin me
I'm the only nigga, walkin the streets with four felonies
But peep this, I see shit is hard, niggas is strugglin
Leave rap alone for a little while, go back to hustlin

[Hook]

Give it to niggas just how they give it to, me
Hit em in a rhyme because I'm a MC
Been a lot of places most niggas won't, see
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggas won't, be
Let your man hold somethin now he want, more
You ain't no fuckin killer what was the front, for
It was a time when the world was at your front, door
Now they change places niggas want, raw
Niggas laugh at me and was mad at me
Cuz the way life was goin had to be a, tragedy
But after me, it's over, I'mma take the whole verse
I'm tryin to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggas go first
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth
Didn't appreciate what you got when you got it
So if I see it, I'mma dot it, where to hide it
You gotta car better drive it the fuck up outta here
And hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it
COME ON

[Hook]

Niggas don't know so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
Barks like a pit scratch when I hit
We both know you pussy but you stay talkin shit
What I'mma have to do dog, run up in yo mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in yo chest
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow
I'mma go platinum (nah) you gots to be kiddin WHY
Make it double platinum, no bullshittin
And I'mma stay flippin flows, rippin shows
Strippin ho's, gettin dough let me go
And nigaz know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is the rest is or might as well be helpless
I wreck this cuz when I wreck shit
I might snatch a niggas necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast
COME ON

[Hook][Jadakiss]
What's the deally yo?
I gotta squeeze the juice outta the headphones
(Jadakiss...)
Yeah (I like that)
Squeeze the juice outta the headphones
Yo, yo yo

[Verse 1]
When you think of me you think of a problem
Who? What? When? and how you gonna solve em
Automatic or revolving
The K I double S and, Here's the lesson
Most beams is infared, but mine's is flourescent
No matter where you go, I'mma spot you
No matter how many people you put me in front of, I'mma rock you
And if you try to be the hard top, I'mma drop you
I got to, treat you like the clutch, and pop you
Creep threw, in the 4-20 with your honey
Cuz you ain't nuthin' but a playboy that turned bunny
And the only the thing left to discuss is more money
In these ??? games these chickens, try to run me
Ya'll know ya'll can't touch us, I flow lushes
It's so real I make her hop out, and get the dutches
I'm sittin on a thousand birds, and I hide from the cameras (why?)
Cuz a picture's, worth a thousand words
Ain't ya'll heard? Ya'll get what ya'll deserved
Ya'll do the catering, while we just get served
And you got some nerve, for P-Hing
Jason, do you have any idea who you facing?
Just something about my shit, you'll never figure out
It's hot it's burning my mouth, that's why I spit it out
It must be, real hard for ya'll to listen
And it's sad, niggas is to broke to pay attention

[Hook]

Chilling, sittin' on about half a million
And all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing

-Repeat-

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, niggas know the line of work, Bullet proof designer shirt
Rolling with a China Doll, She'll be reminding ya'll
Don of the underworld, every block monitored of course
Jadakiss and L-O-X boss
A pro cause I grow off the shit that I absorb
You just another so and so, trying to flow, going broke
You trying to buy property, set it up for growing coke
Niggas making a movie, so I came to edit
Wiping everybody out, right before the credits
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, I flip into the wrong shit
The prime artist, expect me to rhyme hardest
Slash con artist, gonna get mine regardless
I ain't even big and I size niggas up
Cuz they eyes give em up, look at em and see they butt
I'm 22 with 10 ends so there that go
You hear that flow, and drove the underground wacko
Every since 12 I've been spittin like tabacco
Relax though, Pop the tape CD and the wax though
They wonder how, but the thing about ours
We open up 24 hours
Niggas don't sleep with eat so when they speak it mean power
So you should keep quiet, you a coward
About to be layed out flat, and pushing up flowers

[Hook to fade][Hook: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix everybody's hands go up
And they stay there
And they stay yea
And they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Verse 1: DJ Khaled]
Sittin' on the top floor, what you think I'm hot for
Every summer drop more, hits to make my stock go, up
Them hands go, up; them fans go, up
I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma, stay there
We the best of the best, grind while you haters just sleep
I'm yellin' "free Weezy", I rep the heart of the streets
Who hotter than me, I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist, wake up every morning just to count white faces
Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus
Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't [motherfuck ?] nobody better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what!)
(Kill 'em!)
Ok, let's shine my friend
Get up on my grind again
Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Diddy]
Her heart racing like she snort cocaine
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
Got the most paper Mr. New York Times
I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines
Everybody getting money but I cop the first six
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest
Lean back you and your crew, Fat Joe, T-S
Yea it's Young Funeral, all black on me
So act like summers over and fall back homey
Winnin' is all I do, I'll answer all of you
But y'all ain't sayin' shit, like prank callers do

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Jadakiss]
It's already proven, I got them birds movin'
All I do is win, I'm allergic to losin'
Yellow gold cuban, nine mil Ruger
I'll show you what to do with em
Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em
They don't want no problems, they might end up suing em
Disassociate yourself, have nothing to do with em
We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em

[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
Just blew trial, crack lobsters Little Italy
Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I’m a rude boy
You just hit the Power Ball, everyday a new toy
Nigga it’s a stick up, a motherfuckin' robbery
I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me
Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me

[Hook]Turn it up (ha ha ha)

Put y'all in a mailbox and leave open the flap y'all

You got a minute for yo' son father, I need to talk
I'm so tired of tryin to run father, let's take a walk
I'm so sorry for what I done father, it ain't my fault
But the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin hard
And I'm a strong individual, but I need you God
Lot of things that I used to, I don't wanna
Run the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna
Speak the word for you one day
Up in there like, "Hallelujah!" on Sunday
I thank you Lord for the blessings that you gave me
And for my life with the blessings you have saved me
And for my wife you have carried me enough times - and that's the truth
Married me to rough times, throughout my youth
And through it all I saw that you was still with me
I was that one lost sheep and you was comin to get me

[Hook]
Lord you got me like.. your love got me like..
Lord you got me like.. your love got me like..
Lord you got me like.. your love got me like..
Lord you got me like.. your love got me like..

[DMX]
I look at life a little different now, since you hugged me
And I always loved my peoples, but now they love me
Thank you for the love Lord, we praise ya
Jacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia
Pleadin the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right, just help us make it through the night and we'll
Shout yo' name in times of need
And times of joy, and, when we bleed
And, when we are overcome with greed
You ain't gon' half to tell me twice, I'mma take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I, never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad
All praises due to ya
That's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya, thank you father

[Hook]

[DMX]
Uhh..
I never knew a love like, this before
Messin with the thug life I, missed it all
You opened the doors and, let me in
I'm down for the cause so, let's begin
Prayers that you give to me I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now
You got me smilin from inside of my heart, when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain anymore
Only sunshine, no pain anymore, I really love my
You washed away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, the whole thirty years
You know that! one day I'll speak the word
You know that! when I do I will be heard
You know that! you gave me a permanent smile
And you know this father because I'm yo' child, what?

Walk wit ya nigga, hawk wit ya nigga

Ski mask and four pound
Baby grenades, we deep like baby parades
D-Block I'm gon sharpen ya blades
Let's get it on
Videos with bullets flying through Korn
Blaow! Footage turn ya camcords on
It's the underground nigga with bricks, nigga with dough
A nigga fucking all y'all chicks, you know
I'm a gangster and a gentleman too, P
I'll lay a nigga down and send his moms a bouquet for free
I could start a pet store with these birds
I'm the rap Donald Goines with words
Still rob y'all herbs (And I came to)
Hit the club on my dick, light up a blunt
Thug a bitch out, I got the mud in the front
I got the flight jacket, came with wings
When I chase you to the roof
Clappin' at ya ass with one of them things

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

(Sheek)
And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

[Verse 2] (Eve)
Yo, I was determined to sell
And not because I'm just a bunny with a fluffy tail
Had to prove that I could live hard and spit hard
Just a bonus that I'm cute and get ya dick hard
See, I ain't never lettin' mine go
I'mma be here forever with my dogs as the time go
And I know we makin' niggas sick
We in they face everyday every way and they can't handle it
Streets choosin' Double R realest niggas out no confusion
Cats don't want it over here--have you heard
S.P. ain't for games little boy lesson learned
I suggest you stay far from my nigga's face
Hop back go hard all day in a nigga's face
You see, you cowards ain't a threat to us really
Just figured that we let you know that testin' us is silly
Good luck, y'all---Naw forreal, fuck y'all

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

[Verse 3] (Styles)
I live by my pride, I could never be broke
I'mma Ruff Ryde or die catch me bein' with dope
Smokin' weed in the hoopty with the three in the coat
Cause my ace boon-koon got a connect
Told me send a hundred bundles to the day room soon
If the shit go right, he know that it will
We'll be cash, he'll be movin' straight weight through June
But back to this rap shit who thug it the most
It'll take the whole coast just to fuck wth the ghost
He done shut down the game, shit on ya name
If you ain't hold down the street or bust off ya heat
Then me and you is different, we ain't get it the same
And I represent niggas who live it, keep askin' for it
And I represent niggas who give it
This a D-Block Ruff Ryder, Holiday Styles
Cock sucker and I don't give a fuck about you

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

(Sheek)
And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash[Intro - Busta Rhymes]

Oh! We getting Arrab money! We getting Arab money!

[Verse 1 - Busta Rhymes]
Look, you can talk about your money but I really don't care
I'm into copping strange shit, now I'm trying to buy air! (gasps)
As the first black nigga that's a rap trillionaire
I control heat, I'm about to buy the ozone layer!
I'm into copping minerals now: diamonds and granite
So much paper I could probably gift wrap a planet
And clone a million Janets
Respect my accomplishments
As Salam Alaykoum Wa Rahmatoullah Wa Barakatouh !!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Diddy]
Hamdoullilah with my billions pilin'
I'm just wyling, bought 2 islands
Lakshmi Mittal-in', diamonds is salmon
Bout to buy 5th Ave, bitch I'm just stylin'
Money insane; while Jay was popping bottles
I was buying out planes just to fly around Spain
Fuck a recession, I'm still invested
Bout to buy Dubai and swim in the shark section
Fuck it, the dark section
Bitch, that's the Barack section

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Ron Browz]
You might catch me in a coup that cost 100 thous
"Haka la Sheika" means "I love you, Ron Browz!"
My money make noise, yours quiet as a mouse
Send an e-mail: Ether Boy's in the house
All the girls love me, yeah I pop bubbly
"Haka hashahi" means "shorty, dumb, ugly"
Find me on the dance floor doing the duggy
Trucks sit high, dude, next to your buggy

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Swizz Beatz]
Don't call me Swizz no more
Call me Kasim Daoud Shams ul-Din
When I come through, hit you with that brand new
Bugatti Coupe; damn thing only-only seats 2
But you know who (who?) Goon who be riding in my passenger
Side, we be flying shit, 2.5 in it
Hey, h-hey-hey-HEY - I'm in my Jeezy watching TV
She call me "Ha-habibi" while she feeding me linguine
Left right, l-left right - that Arab dance popping right
Swizz Beatz, Busta Bus, the money-money buss pipes

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - T-Pain]
I let my chain hang down with the rest of them
Teddy Pain rain down on the rest of them
Mr. Stripper Man that be hollering "get em man!" I'm at em, man
Rubberband; dropping money bombs like a Taliban
Oh la la, we getting Arab money
You want this hook, you gonna pay that money
Save that money, give it to my kids
I'll take that honey, give her all my kids like -

[Hook]

[Verse 6 - Akon]
I got that Arab money
4-star Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Straight cash when I come in
Lemme exchange the currency cause it's all foreign
I got that A-RAB MONEY!
Waking up to 5 concubines in the morning
Diamond mines still runnin'
On all of Africa, you can ask Tarzan

[Hook]

[Verse 7 - Lil' Wayne]
Calendar say I get money everyday
Smile look like iced-out Perrier
Bury me a G and tell her kids that I was
Now jump into your grave if you dig what I dug

Them haters can’t tell me nothing
Them haters can’t tell you nothing
(x2)

[Dirty Money]
So, made me cry don’t you hurt, hurt my pride
Got me madder than a muthacker
Trying to fight my way back to your heart you muthafucker
? in your arms I feel safe
Shit you know deep down, I will always love ya
Trying to find your way back to my heart you muthaf-cker

[Hook]

[Diddy]
Yo turn me up, I’mma make sure she can hear me
Yo, thats girls gon get ya, muthafucker
Smoke weed, listening to Sade
I left my pain in Paris
Why can’t you see shit my way
You on that lonely highway
My car’s still on that driveway
Feels like I’m dying slowly
Feels like what more can I say
I made you face your fears
I think we could have made it
Thought I told you I love you
Maybe we should have waited
How could you ever doubt me
When I stood by you proudly
I would have gave my last breath
Now you can’t breathe without me

[Dirty Money]
Oh when you're in the club baby
All you think about is your baby (x2)
Baby I want you to need me
I need you
You want me, I want you to love me forever[DMX]
Huh, This go out to my dog Kato, rest in piece baby

Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you! A'YO KATO!

[Verse One: DMX]
Started off two dogs with the same goal (uh!)
Nothing but two dogs walkin' the same road (uh!)
Two different cultures, but had the same heart (yeah)
Enjoyed seeing the light, but lived in the dark
5th Avenue, bumped heads in the parking lot (aight)
Was a quite brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came direct (uh), when he came, gave respect
So I gave respect, (uh) we shared the same respect
To name regret, in our own circles
Two brothers with good hearts, but if you start
Two brothers that'll hurt you (yeah)
Know how that dirt do, Hittin four corners
(arf, arf, arf, ARF) Right back upon us
God tried to warn us, but sometimes we don't see
When I first heard I'm like "THIS CAN'T BE!
Y'all niggas is bugging
Got the wrong information or something
Please tell me these niggas is frontin'"
God know..

[Hook]
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
(we miss you, Kato)
We miss you! A'YO KATO!
Dogs that I call my friends
(we miss you, Kato)
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
(we miss you, Kato)
We miss you! A'YO KATO!]

[Verse Two: DMX]
A'yo K' let me kick it wid you for a minute
There was things left unsaid, dog, we wasn't finished
Never got to say THANKYOU for being a friend
DOGS FOR LIFE, and you...rode to the end
Held dog down, didn't let a day go by
Everytime dog came the the shy
I was good, trips our to Phoenix, with the scrambler squad
Now I come back to Phoenix and like "damn it's hard"
To accept the fact, that you won't be coming back
But I hope you coming back, 'cosI won't accept the fact
When you came to New York, you had to come to the crib
And vice-versa, (yeah!), thats just how we did
Remote control cars, (WHAT!), we would rac all day
It was adventure, we would chase our day! (yeah!)
So I'm not gonna say goodbye my nigga
Instead I would rather
Focus on the time we spent together, that's what matters

[Hook]

[Verse Three: DMX]
Need you to save me a spot, next to you and the lord (aight)
Don't know when I'm coming, but keep checking the door (aight)
But while I'm here, knock on wood
I'll make sure that your kids remember who their father was
And Val is good, (aight!) understood how real niggas move
We don't part, but ya gonna always have family in New York
Believe that (yeah!), where you at, you can see that
We dogs for life and to death and I mean that!

[Hook] - 2X

[DMX]
Yo, 'Where The Hood At' is banging right now, man
That was your favourite choice, ya know what I mean?

[Magic & Val] We miss you, Kato

It's going just like we thought it would baby

[Magic & Val] We miss you, Kato

[DMX] Aight

[Magic & Val] We miss you, Kato!

[Val] I'll always love you K'[Reporter]
Rapper and actor DMX along with wife pregnant wife Tashera
Showed up at the federal court in Queens Wednesday
To accept a plea agreement
Inside the courthouse, DMX signed autographs with a sketch artist over the face
As well as the fans caught off guard
By this star's appearances

[Hook: DMX]
My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah
(Repeat)

[DMX]
My baby's motha be buggin, she wanna blast stick bitches
One of them talk shit, and then get they ass kicked bitches
Once upon a story, yall niggas know the story
And that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having bad thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed, and hardly ever get rest
It's '05, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me liftin through that riffin shit cousin
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy
And I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin at me
You listenin thinkin that's a crazy brother
But I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin with his baby motha

[Hook: 2x]

[DMX]
Bitches be callin the cops, thinkin they callin the shots
Takin the dude with the bag, baby it's all in the pops
And do yo thing, cause I'm doin mine boo
A nigga just been chillin, I been just fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gon, I'm frontin
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, let the shit you like switchin clothes
When them bitches through, ain't to co sure when they home
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess
Askin for that Cougie sweater, patten up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big
I ain't gon blow yo shit no more, I shouldn't be even did that
Cause you my baby motha, and I'mma always hit that

[Hook: Janyce] (DMX)
Give a hell what you say (You don't)
I ain't never gon go away (You won't)
I'mma stalk you till I find you (Been there)
Turn around and be right behind you (Still there)
Be in the bushes outside yo house
Just waitin for you to come out
Cause I'm a stupid bitch (I know)
A real fuckin stupid bitch (I know)
Ain't nothing but a stupid bitch

[Hook: 2x]

[DMX]
My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with this bitch no more"
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans
So I can be like "Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck"
But you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck
Plus, you don't wanna be around and see what honey do
And plenty comin through, she comin through with that twenty-two
Trust me, you don't need that in your life
Oh yall bitches already know, I got a wife
You'se a stupid bitch, a real fuckin stupid bitch
You ain't nothing but a stupid bitch. Bitch!

[Bridge]

[Hook until fade][Intro]
N.O.R.E the movie coming soon
Timbaland, shut the fuck up
Tryna be out in '98, you know
I'm tryna watch this movie, this the real shit
Shut the fuck up, '98, it's ours

[Verse 1: Nature]
Regardless of rain or snow, sleet or hail
I kick street tales, choking niggas like I'm Sprewell
Golden State, holding your fate in the palm of my hand
Blow you away like it's part of the plan
I gotta call it like I see it, talk it like I be it
Walking my walk, thugged out orthopedic
Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up
Niggas try to stick me like Abdul Louima
Follow the leader, make me go extra hard
Yo N.O.R.E. should I hold back or show the repertoire
Quit at sixteen or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers
I show them why it's so hard to reach us
I get pussy with my father's features, puff heavily
See me at 6'1", weigh a buck 70
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be
Packed in like Green Bay, Harlem week to Queens day
Performing acapella, no DJ
'98 Live, no replays, make it seem easy
So tell a friend to tell a friend
That it's them again, Nature, Noreaga, wild gremlins

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
Champagne on the rocks, sporting a Fort Knox Lazarus
Shark salad with carrots, pork chops and applesauce
Twin connection, disrespect watch your body cave in
Pump the shotty guaging, hit the shorty while he potty training
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst
You'll be the first to get his whole body fully reversed
Uzi ya hearse, leave you double-dead, I'm a bubble-head
I never listen to nothing my mother said
I hold niggas ransom for money like Johnny Handsome
Been soning niggas for so long, I think I got a grandson
My passion is money, a stash and a honey
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody
That's my kind of girl, kind of world I want to live in
Not a cell or a prison or in Hell's Armageddon
Just a little ghetto where my niggas control the middle
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Been in rich places, sick places
Seen my story, 6,666 pages
Wages, I rolled six aces and at the same dice games
I caught six cases, all over big faces
Now it's tipped laces, ready to dig faces
But the banger ain't a bit spacious
Niggas loading up their rib cages, cats to rent rib places
Bloody lip taste it, but Cam is a big racist
But I stay in import the pig places
But the world know the girl though, I fuck her off a furlough
She'll be up, hook me up, all your sales could be luck
Only question for these ducks is, "Baby girl could we fuck?"
You the type that need a wife
Thought L-O-X told y'all the key to life, asshole
Yo I don't play around, I lay it down, fuck around, I spray a round
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it, my ass you can kick or kiss it

[Verse 4: Jadakiss (Styles P)]
Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this
Bust off and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips
Like two thirds of a brick, (Paniero) and 'Kiss
The kiss the crystal white fluffy part that'll (come back quick
(See the plan is to stash all) and cash y'all
(The weed so strong), they gotta put it glass jars
Niggas try to smoke me out the (moke me out)
Cause the rims on my new joint be poking out
(I'm about to have no feelings, shit is deep)
Do they dance with the Devil when they sleep
(I wake up gripping the air, wishing to hear)
Shit that they kick in your ear when your soul drift in the air
(My gift is half-rotten when I'm spitting some tears
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry)
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die
(They say you get what you ask for) So get it cause you asked for it
(If a nigga ain't a thief) then he better have the cash for it
(And we gonna be around till ya body rot)
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got nigga

[Verse 5: Noreaga]
There's two ways into the hood, one plain
The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain
Let's get loose, Hennessy straight with tomato juice
Queens stallion, my guns, fully Italian
Now y'all niggas recognize medallions
I play the best hood, O-T with Tim Westwood
Used to be on Section 8, now my section is good
Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could
And I don't give a fuck what, yo I save my shit
And I don't give a fuck what, you can save your shit
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Listen to Bob Marley, y'all funny niggas like Steve Harvey
Fronting live with a weak army
I play the nice guy too and even smoke with you
But the realness, I ain't got no love for you
That's why I never do a song with you
Not even if your baby moms fucked the crew
And promised to give us head and swallow too
I still say low, no is no, no can do
Ya niggas drinking Haterade, drinking my flow

[Outro: Noreaga]
Yo, thug shit thug shit what what
What the fuck is the deal, thugged out entertainment
Untertainment
L-o-x, Terror Squad, this shit is fuckin' official[Verse]
Ayo, it’s Weezy muthafuckin', easy with the hating
Bitch, I’m in the building; you just decorating
I’m just detonating, then I get blatant
More dangerous than Internet dating
Scoob got the cameras on so I got to show off
I put your sister on, I knock your bro off
Weezy just spit snowballs: catch it in your face, bitch
Good game, Wayne; mane, I deserve a Naismith
Cook caine game flow: dope-in-the-vein flow
I’ll only be smoking the purple out the rainbow
Stronger than Drano, your boyfriend a lame-o
And if you stay with him, then y’all in the same boat
Deepwater Carter, fishing for a dollar
You can join the salad I’m splitting your tomata
Ball cause I gotta, you’ll love me in the morning
I told her I'm a king, them other niggas Prince Charming
She love to rock the mic, she say there's nothing like performing
Man I'm in love with her grill: George Foreman
Forewarning: Young Money’s on, and we can shoot it out
I got the money drawn; yeah, take that to the bank with ya
I rock my hat to the side like I paint pictures
Smoke weed, talk shit like Lane Kiffin
Whole country in recession, but Wayne different
And I’m a Maybach rider, haven’t drove it one time
I got a cool black driver, can't walk around with guns
I got a dude that got 'em; don’t worry if I'm shootin
As long as you get shot; I'm a beast, I'm a pitbull
I get my ass kissed, I get my dick pulled
I'm a beast, I'm a big bull
I got my money right, I got my clip full
Haha, it’s like 7 in the morning', nigga
I’m up for whoever the opponent, nigga
Stop the track, let me relish in the moment, nigga
Now bring that motherfucker back, cause I’m zoning, nigga
I go hard like Rafael Nadal
And if the bitches were a habit, I bet we have them all
And man, I'm so high it's like an ever-lasting fall
And I’m charging these hoes like women's basketball
I bet that chopper get his mind right
Leave a hole in his chest like a lion bite
Super hero car like I crime fight
I see big cheese, you niggas blind mice
T-Streets still roll with me
Still sticking to the script like Nicole Kidman
Need the man hit? We are those hitmen
He stopped running, the bullet holes didn’t
Basically, I’m still a monster
Till the fat lady sings I come to kill the Opera
Y'all too plain: I'm a helicopter
My words keep going like a teleprompter
I’m a asshole: wipe me down, bitch
I get big checks: Nike Town, bitch
Yeah, mean mug, Bobby Brown shit
And the flag red like clown lips, T., I can't stop goin' in
Dropped my best shit like the Cowboys dropped Owens
I’m the best to ever do it, motherfucker, I know it
No Ceilings, goddammit, now the fuckin sky’s showin'[Intro: Nigo]

Rope chains, Rakim and Eric B
Bought my sidekicks Suzuki Jeeps and Cherokees
Hoop earrings, coupes with the rear cameras
Put that bitch in a cherry M3
I'm not your average dope dealer
Silver Toyotas four runners and four wheelers
Me and Teflon Q45 infinite
Windows tinted, white girl all in it
Britney, bitch
MCM seats buck 50 stitch
Versace plates got the Basquiat
Collab from Versace's place
Cuban link 5 kilo
Your life is illegal when your chain can get the rico
Real niggas all feel the hook

Your wrist like fuckin' a bitch with no see boy

Pretend to be BIG, pretend to be Pac, pretend to be hot
But all that pretendin' gon' eventually stop
And the slugs gonna eventually pop
Cause all the real thugs in the box or the penatentary oxe

I'm from a town where it go down at
Couple dudes is real but for the most part they low down rats
And I don't know about the ghetto they hearin'
I'm in the musty yellow McClaren
You can't even tell how I'm steering
It's too exotic, niggas act different kinda' funny
I guess it's cause I'm dealin' wit a different kind of money
And I don't wanna drive it if it cost under 2 cent
And even though I hate they force me to get the new Bent
Assholes, my passport is like castrolls
Y'all niggas still tryin' to pass go
You know I throw darts like a bow and a arrow
Remember this, the business is big and so is the barrel, what

[Hook]

[Cassidy]
I got a large house, a dog house in my backyard
And even my doghouse got a backyard
Big cars, cigars and big biscuits
The kid is doin' it big, it's "Big Business"

The Murciélago doors in the air yeah
The dough I be grippin' it all up
The 'dro I be getting I'm twistin' it all up
The flows I be flippin' and switching 'em all up
And the hoes I be hitting be lickin' it all up
The new kid on the block, admit it it's hot
Cause I'm great like the late Pun, Biggie, and 'Pac

[Snoop Dogg]
Fa' shizzle dizzle
It's Big Snoopy D-O double Gizzle
Wit my nephew Swizzle, you know it's off the hizzle

Do it on the strip of love, you ain't got to call my lawyer
Chop a sucka' down for ya like I'm Tom Sawyer
Chip-chip away, Ruff Rydin' everyday
See on the East Side we slide on a different page
And get 100 thousand everytime we hit the stage
Keep a gauge, just incase you wanna act up
Cock back, and go back up - back up
So stop trippin' off, your breezy
Look, I'm not Mr. Big but I'll let you down easy

[Outro]
Swizz Beatz - get money
Swizz Beatz - make money

[Jadakiss]
Yo, I used to have bad luck
Now you might see me in a Jag truck
Mad stuck, either with a dime or a bad duck
Double-R T with the matchin bandana
38-snub blue steel with no hammer
And I see y'all niggas tryin to glance at the 'Kiss
Cause I walk around with your whole advance on my wrist
Bonin' your women, drunk off Corona's and lemon
And you know I'm still writin the mean, lightin the green
I need to boogie, even though I look, right in the beam
Judge find out it's my team, he boost they bails
Niggas throw us on they album, try to boost they sales
We put our pies on the table and our eyes on a label
Cause them rednecks up in the mountains'll try to slay you
(They call me) Raspy, tell you what I want you to know
Fuck what you ask me - you probably don't, want me to blow
I got a lot of horsepower so I'm able to skip
Usually a good nigga, even though I'm able to flip
You pay 30 for the 'Kiss (uh-huh) a 100 for The L.O.X. (yeah)
And if we cool, then I write a hook for a drop
Whatever's in the bank is my bet, a z-bull's my pet
And you can bet he'll get the legs and the neck

[Sheek Louch]
Uh-huh, yeah, aiyyo
Yo when my gun bust, send niggas to the fish like Swanson
New York's youngest Bumpy Johnson, I put fear in y'all heads
Sheek Louch, type of nigga gasoline y'all beds
And that's warnin, if you all alive in the mornin, that's fine
Now I suggest you hit the block and get what's rightfully mine
I want PC - see me? Tuck in your chains
I got niggas my pop's age that lifestyle ain't changed
It's like wake up, move a brick, half of it slow
Make car money, check with Sheik, go fuck with a ho
I rock a waist length mink, do-rag under my fitted
And I don't even want waves, Timbs be halfway new
That's Sheik in the dress-up club cause I don't fuck with shoes
And for my nigga's life, I swear to the Bible, let it be told
I put thirty in your head, all in the same hole
Cause we got the same goal, and you try an' tamper with mine?
Don't make me motherfuckin leave you with some shit in yo' spine
Fuck with me you be a WAS nigga, nigga WAS dope
Nigga WAS gettin money 'fore I extorted your coke, 'ju crazy?

[Styles]
Aiyyo, catch me with a thirty-eight, box and shells
In a ninety-eight Lincoln eatin pasta shells
Order to go, always got a box of L's
Blow, stay on the low, get a Heine' and swig
I'm Pinero, so I hate a snake, rat, or a pig
I pop shit cause I'm the second best, the first was B.I.G
Y'all niggas is son-ned out, let me speak to your father
Cause I like to play chess and I swing the revolver
If I don't like a nigga, I don't even be bothered
I spit, I'm just a crooked nigga goin legit
You hold your nine if you holdin a brick
Common sense, Fed drama, you hit the Bahamas, get bent
L.O.X. get respect like Sonny from "Bronx Tale"
Us and DMX, the Ruff Ryder cartel
Thirsty to live, or y'all niggas eager to die?
I tell all my niggas ride, you won't leave with a dime
Motherfucker

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, yeah
I'm a monster, I sleep whole winters; wake up and spit summers
Ghetto nigga, puttin up Will Smith numbers
Surrounded by 6's and Hummers, bitches among us
Tryin not to let this bullshit become us
It started from hunger, til it all went insane
Now bitches notice the chains now that I hit my number
The chickens I twisted see the digits unlisted
The beeper done changed; you dead bitch, the Reaper done came
I suggest niggas stop speakin my name
Cause trust me, y'all can still feel the heat in the rain
I keep creepin, streets keep watchin, I keep poppin
Niggas is hot heads and the bullets is heat-seekin
Jay flow for pesos -- chase hoes NOT
I just circle 'round the block in a drop
Tell them jump through the top (uh-huh)
Where the sun roof used to be
I could see y'all not used to me
Nigga flows like none other - I'm the meanest
Toughest Don Dada to gun butt ya
You the type that bust a lot of shots and none touch ya
I'm the type that get excited, when the gun touch ya
Motherfuckers..
Y'all niggas bout to witness a dynasty like no other

[DMX]
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.. I'm headed nowhere fast
Runnin' in place, gat in my waist
Niggas wanted a taste, but wouldn't come to my face
So what that mean? You cats is playin games again
So now what I do? Start namin names again (WHAT!)
All you motherfuckers know, that I speak from the heart (UH!)
Play like you don't know, L.O.X. is gon' bark
We can take it there, but to make it fair, get some more niggas
Styles, Sheik, Jay, we comin with like four niggas (AIGHT!)
Y'all niggas, best to stop playin, it'll be the ones you forgotten about
That'll get you shot in your mouth (ARF! ARF!)
Got my dogs covered (UH!)
Plus it's all gravy like chicken when it's smothered (WHAT!)
"It's Dark," and I LOVE IT! (UH!)
Get him boy - let him loose (C'MON!)
You want it with the dog or the gun, let him choose (C'MON!)
