[Hook](x2)
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

[Verse 1]
Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall wit yo friend
I was scared to approach ya, but then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends?
We're real worldwide, breakin all the rules
She like a song played again and again

[Pre-Hook]
That girl, like somethin off a poster
That girl, is a dime they say
That girl, is a gun to my holster
She's runnin through my mind all day, ay

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2]
See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night til the morn
Girl you really changed my life
Doin things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes
We're real worldwide, breakin all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook](x2)

[Bridge]
I can be your melody
Oh girl that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me
Ay, I can be your melody
Oh girl that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me
Ay, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Shawty got me singin
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Now she got me singin

[Hook](x2)[Intro: Iyaz]
Shawty's love is like a pyramid
We stand together 'till the very end
There'll never be another love for sure
Iyaz and Charice let we go

[Verse 1: Charice]
Stones, heavy like the love you've shown
Solid as the ground we've known
And I just wanna carry on
We took it from the bottom up
And even in a desert storm
Sturdy as a rock, we hold
Wishing every moment froze
Now I just wanna let you know

[Pre-Hook: Charice and Iyaz]
Earthquakes can't shake us
Cyclones can't break us
Hurricanes can't take away our love

[Hook: Charice]
Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top (At the top, baby)
Like a pyramid

And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall, just keep on going
Forever we will stay
Like a pyramid

[Post-Hook: Iyaz]
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey

[Verse 2: Charice]
Cold, never ever when you're close
We will never let it fold
A story that was never told
Something like a mystery

[Iyaz]
And every step we took we've grown
Look how fast the time has flown
A journey to a place unknown

[Charice]
We're going down in history

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge: Iyaz]
Like a pyramid, girl, I'mma show you
That I love you so much, that we gonna get through
Even when it storms, I will never go
I'mma be the one to keep you safe, hey
Four walls and love, packing more than enough
Holding on to one another, be the cover when it's rough
Mother nature or disaster
Won't stop our happy ever after

[Charice]
Pyramid, keep it going
(Like a pyramid, like a pyramid)
(Like a pyramid, like a pyramid)
Pyramid

[Post-Hook][Intro]
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I got to do it solo

[Verse 1]
See how we used to be a team
Running the streets, ya we was living out our dream, oh
You used to be my rider, I was your provider
And now we separated in two
Oh we was burning up the block
And everybody know when we step in the spot, oh
See, we was like the dynamic duo
I'd never thought that you'd go, but you did now
Yeah, you did

[Pre-Hook]
And baby you left and sailed away alone
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With nowhere to get home

[Hook]
And I don't wanna go, no
I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, no
I don't wanna go, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo
Cause I was so high and I was so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
Said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
You asked me pinned onto my top line
Put us together and you have to hit the rewind
See, you give me a purpose, now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again
Oh, when we were burning up the airways
They knew us from the Virgin Islands to the U.K.
See, we was on the way to the platinum and gold
Never thought you'd go, but you did, yeah
Yeah, You did

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O

I don't ever wanna let your love go
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O

This boy, That girl[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
So many different flavors
So many shapes and sizes
You coming with me and you going with Iyaz
No surprises, I put it all on the table for you
Nothing is too taboo, I'm ready, willing and able for you

[Pre-Hook: Iyaz]
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm trying to pick the right one
I'm trying to pick the right one
Trying to find a shorty to hold me down

[Verse 2: Iyaz]
They say to get the New York girl Then you gotta have a lot of class
And I heard there ain't nothing like the Cali girls
But you better have a lot of cash
And I know there ain't nothing like the A-Town girl
Cuz they know how to show you love
And no matter where I go I gotta let them know
That this song here is about you
See I don't mean to run away
To places you would not believe
It's dealing on these pretty gals
I'm wishing you were there with me
It's simple when you smile girl
Trust me all I need to know
You can be my one and only

[Hook: Iyaz]
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city

Trying to find a shorty to hold me down
Tell me is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl? [x4]

[Verse 3: Iyaz]
They say
To get a MIA girl
Then you gotta have a lot of swag
I heard
To get a Down South Bell
Then you gotta ride a Cadillac
I know ain't like a London girl
Cuz they know how to party, oh
And no matter where I go
I gotta let em know
That this song here is about you
I don't mean to run away
Places you would not believe
It's dealing on these pretty gals
I'm wishing you were there with me
It's simple when you smile girl
Tell me all I need to know
You can be my one and only

[Hook: Iyaz]

[Verse 4: Travie McCoy]
I'm so indecisive
Trying to find a pretty girl that these shoes goes nice with
Been around the world and back
Got a nack for them girls in black
But I need a chick that's gonna hold me tight like vice grips
Just make sure you leave my heart how you found it
You can keep the key but the lock stays around it
Baby, let's take it slow, no pulling a fast one
And you look like the type to keep my mind off the last one

[Hook: Iyaz][Pre-Hook: Iyaz]
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city

I'm so indecisive
Trying to find a pretty girl that these shoes goes nice with
Been around the world and back
Got a nack for them girls in black
But I need a chick
That's gonna hold me tight like vice grips
Just make sure you leave my heart how you found it
You can keep the key but the lock stays around it
Baby, let's take it slow, no pulling a fast one
And you look like the type to keep my mind off the last one

[Hook: Iyaz][Verse 1]
Mama, I found a plan
I love it, and you should understand
Papa, it’s quite a plan
It’s for me, and I’m its biggest fan
And don’t get me wrong
I know it’s not perfect, in your eyes
But somehow it’s flawless in mine

[Pre-Hook]
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can’t do that
I’m too far down to hold
You’ve got a hold on my soul

[Hook]
So I guess I’m a fool, I’m a fool in love girl
I’m willing to stay here and bask in the glory of my heart
I guess I’m a fool in love
But I’m willing to look so stupid 'till I've had enough

[Verse 2]
Mama, don’t judge me now
I’m not trying to hurt you but I know it won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
So tell me are you ashamed of how your little boy turned out?
You see a monster, I see a smile
You say it's danger and I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

[Hook][Intro] + (Iyaz)
New Boyz! (Geah gal!)
(Well tell dem wussy boy)

She make me wanna break my bank (my bank)

Where my money at? Where my money at?
Break my bank (my bank)
Forget about the tag (tag) throw it in the bag (bag)
Make it rain (it rain)
Shawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank

[Verse 1: Legacy]
Damn - girl! You look better than the videos
Think I wanna break my bank, hammer to the piggy though
All-all the groupie girls gettin jealous of what I spend
They tryin to chop it up, but I ain't The Karate Kid
Jaden! Everyday I'm spendin' more on her
I don't buy shit, like I barely hold the door open
Every time I say this shit I always get her one more
When it's time for taxes, a nigga gon' be done for

[Hook]

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank

[Verse 2: Ben J]
Okay, the start of my day, I took her on a date
Had to scrape for some change, so I went to the bank
But when I seen her she was so damn fine like that
So I headed right back to pull a lot more stacks
Overdrawn, low funds, it's-it's like I'm dumb
But I'll put it right back cause your boy is sprung
Man she is so damn fine got me spendin all this cash
Man it's goin too fast, I need to watch my ass

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank

[Breakdown]
If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank (go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you tryin to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank (go-go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank (go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you tryin to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank (go-go break yo' bank!)

[Hook]

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank[Intro]
She's Bulletproof

[Verse 1]
It was love before
Girl I know your heart's been through the storm and more
I can tell you barely survive
Girl my love won't be the same
I'm not tryna run no games
I just want your tears to dry

[Hook]
Your heart's the target
But every time I fire I can't get through, through, through
I fight my hardest
But I'm running out of weapons to use, use
But losing's not an option
So I keep shooting my love away
Keep shooting my love away
Damn this girl is bulletproof proof
But I, Keep shooting my love away
Keep shooting my love away
Damn this girl is bulletproof proof (She's bulletproof)

[Verse 2]
Feels like we both at war
Out of ammo, can't shoot no more
What do you want from me?
I can feel you reaching out now
But you gotta let your guard down
Why's it so hard to see?

[Hook ×2][Intro: Iyaz]

Like where am I?
And when am I coming home?

Why you listening to your friends?
They don't wanna see us be
Boy, you better take it slow
Or I'll be history

[Pre-Chorus:]
You've got to give me my space
So quick to calling my name
Boy, you better recognize
My love is one of a kind

You drive me up to the ceiling
Boy, there's no need for the screaming
You know that you are my world
But I'm sick and tired of the

So why you up in my ear?

So I went out to the club

Cause when I got back home
Put my foot through the door
All the lights came on
Then came the

Running the streets, ya we was living out our dream, oh
You used to be my rider, I was your provider
And now we separated in two
Oh we was burning up the block
And everybody know when we step in the spot, oh
See, we was like the dynamic duo
I'd never thought that you'd go, but you did now
Yeah, you did

[Pre-Hook]
And baby you left and sailed away alone
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With nowhere to get home

[Hook]
And I don't wanna go, no
I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, no
I don't wanna go, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo
Cause I was so high and I was so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
Said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
You asked me pinned onto my top line
Put us together and you have to hit the rewind
See, you give me a purpose, now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again
Oh, when we were burning up the airways
They knew us from the Virgin Islands to the U.K.
See, we was on the way to the platinum and gold
Never thought you'd go, but you did, yeah
Yeah, You did

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't ever wanna let your love go
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O

[Mann -- 1st Verse]
Here come the brand new new in your ear
This feels like the nominated song of the year
Feeling damn good up in here
Cause I'm representing from my whole hood up in here
But I'm not gonna get ghetto though
Mingling with some women feeling incredible
And I'm tryna bag a chick from a centrefold and I'm trying burn bread like its finna be toast
Finally up in the game and feeling me coach
Cause I'm first class flinching I ain't finna be coach
Yeah this is celebration that never in tell a friend girl, the mack is back

[Iyaz -- Hook]
We can take it back and hit the streets
Let the top down so they can see
We can hit the clubs and party hard
Cause I just bought out the bar

[Snoop Doggy Dogg -- 2nd Verse]
I got keys to whatever
Trees of endeavour
Mann, he is buzzin', and he's on my level
He's on the pedal, drive off slow
Seven deuce Cadillac is convertible
She wanna be with the mack at it's best
Dogg in the house while I'm cranking it bad
They say, we say, you say don't
Take it to the top now drop it down low
Meat on my back, snooped it and booted it
Cripped out, pimped out
What would you do if he me
Would you hop on a freak while you bop to the beat
Now we can take it back and hit the streets

[Iyaz - Hook]
(Now we can take it) back and hit the streets
Let the top down so they can see

Now we're sipping caffe patron
Smoke that kush till we get blown
Return of the mack (C'mon)
Return of the mack (Once again)
Return of the mack (I knew)
Cause you know that I'll be back (Yeah)

[Mann - Verse 3]
Honey if I gotta think money clipping'
Than he broker than a joke at it's funniest
And man never call me crip with the lavish life
So one time off, I won't ask you twice
When we go shopping, mama don't ask the price
Got to get it down if they give me cash advice
When it comes to this game I'm a mastermind
I spit classic line after classic line
Ha, and that ass is fine
Think it's one past the nine and that's a dime
Yeah, it's a celebration then
Never in, tell a friend girl that the mack is back, baby

[Iyaz - Hook]
(Now we can take it) back and hit the streets
Let the top down so they can see
We can hit the clubs and party hard
Cause I just bought out the bar

[Mann - Outro]
Let Me Hear You Say Yeah
Let Me Hear You Say West
Let Me Hear You Say Yeah
Everyday we stay fresh (Fresh)[Hook]
At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over, and life is like a song

[Verse 1]
I've had my heart broken in two over and over again
First it was this girl named Renee
She went and slept with my best friend
Just wanted to be left alone
But then came along Emily
And she did the same thing to me

Eight months later was Jessica
I gave her my heart, she through it on the floor
To think that I trusted her
I lent her my card, and she bought out the store
So I had to let her go and open my heart up to destiny
And she opened her arms to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I lay next to you
It's like a feeling I never felt
I know that heaven is missing you
It's what I'm saying to myself
Girl I've been through all of this pain
But now I am finally free
Cause you gave your love to me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Baby, I been through the stars
And a share of broken hearts
And I don't know what you did but you'll always be my baby
Cause baby, I gave up on love
Girl I had enough
Just that you came running and you turned my life into a song

[Hook ×2][Hook]
I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out
I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out

[Verse 1]
It started, we was at the mall, it's the first place we ever met
Off in a gaze?, I was thinkin' of ways to tell my love that this is the end
And as we sittin sippin' Pina Coladas, the thoughts wouldn't leave me alone
I know exactly what I gotta do, but I'mma let her know when we get home
My love don't wanna see you cry, and I don't never wanna leave
This situation got me so lost for words, but I'mma try to tell you how I feel

[Pre-Hook]
How am I to tell the love of my life, I'm in love with my best friend
I play it over and over up in my head, and I know how it's gonna end
How am I to tell the love of my life, I'm in love with my best friend,
I'm tryin' hard to find the word, but not one seems to make sense.

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, lemme holla at you, cause I really think that we need to talk
And by the way that you looked in my eyes, I could tell you knew something was wrong,
And as I watched as you tried to plate up, with the tears fillin' up in your eyes
You put your hands around my waist and hugged me tighter and said "Baby tell me what's on your mind"
My love, you know me from the get go, I've always got to keep real
This situation got me so lost for words but I'mma try to tell you how I feel

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Eh, Oh I, Oh I, Oh I,
I'm I love with my best friend
Eh, Oh I, Oh I, Oh I,
I'm I love with my best friend

[Hook][Verse 1: Iyaz]
I’m supposed to be excited, but I don’t know where to start
The fire’s getting warmer, but it’s freezing in my heart
There’s laughter all around me, but I can’t break a smile
And as the bells get louder, it’s almost that time
Cause I don’t need a gnome on lace, I just want a bit of your time
Nobody lightning up the tree this year cause nothing shines when you’re not here

[Hook: Iyaz]
But tonight is the night, I’ve been waiting all that long for
And it’s time to find, the one thing that I’ve asked for
Shining from the roof top, singing to the sky
Let everybody see me, shed the fable life
Cause you’re here and now, let all our hearts unite
It’s Christmas time

[Verse 2: Sha Sha Jones]
I won’t feel the magic, if it’s in the air
And even if it was I’d probably wouldn’t even care
there’s one thing that I’m hoping, my only wish is this
That we find each other, cause you’re exactly what I need
I don’t need a new red dress, I just want a bit of your time
Nobody lighting up the tree this year cause nothing shines when you’re not here

[Hook]

[Bridge: Iyaz and Sha Sha Jones]
I know I look stupid standing, under the mistletoe
Why you wanna keep me waiting? Baby walk through that door
Let’s gather around the fire, share stories about this year
Let tonight be the night to remember that there’s no Christmas without you here
I’ve been waiting all that long for
the one thing that I’ve asked for

[Hook][Intro]
Da da da, da da da

[Hook]
You keep on coming up with lies
And saying sorry, da da da
Sorry, da da da, sorry, da da da
But I ain't buying all your lying
You ain't sorry, da da da
Sorry, da da da, sorry, da da da

[Verse 1]
Hey baby girl, what you doing?
Give you my world, but you screwed me
Gone crying, crying
I can't believe I'm crying for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't crying, why you stalking me?
I meant it when I said goodbye
Don't crying, now you ain't listening
I don't know why I'm wasting my time

[Hook]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So let's go, let's go separate ways
You and me, we had our days
It's OK so don't you say
"Sorry, da da da"
Leave me, leave me all alone
Stop it, stop calling my phone
Time to grown on on your own
Sorry, da da da

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't sorry, da da da
Don't give me sorry, da da da
Don't crying, don't crying
I can't believe I'm crying for you

[Hook][Verse 1]
I don't wanna go there
Wish you'd never go there
I don't wanna go there
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Hook]
You said you needed somebody
You're sick of being alone
I should've stuck to the plan
I should've left you alone
We both can be in denial
Don't make it any less true
Fact is, let's face it
I can never have you

[Hook]
So please baby
So please don't love me
And I won't love you
'Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful.
So please don't love me
And I won't love you
And if you love me
Then we should just let it go.
We should just let it go
We should just let it go
We should just let it go
We should just let it go

[Verse 2]
All I got to say right now
Is you deserve what I've never had
Somebody to body, with not just anybody
To make it beautiful
Can't believe how deep I'm falling
Can't let it happen
There is no bandage to fit the damage

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I wish the best wasn't the best
And you were so perfect and I was so bad
The last thing I want is to wake your heart
All that I'm asking is to be with you
Move on

[Hook]

[Outro]
I don't wanna go there
Wish you'd never go there[Intro: Iyaz]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Just like the way down in Africa
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for

[Stevie Hoang]
I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you

[Verse 1: Stevie Hoang]
Girl I know everywhere we go they don't wanna see us together
Girl just don't take your love away, cause I'm willing to do whatever
Cause I don't wanna see you cry, girl, I just wanna be your guy
Just know that we will be alright, cause as lovers we'll prepare to fight

[Hook: Stevie Hoang]
Cause baby I don't wanna go another day
And I don't wanna see another face
I'm not gonna let them tear us down
I'm doing this so you know I'll fight for you

[Iyaz]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Just like the way down in Africa
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for

[Verse 2: Stevie Hoang]
What they say, it don't even matter, cause they don't really understand
What we have is gonna last forever, I'mma do the best I can
Cause I don't wanna see you cry, girl, I just wanna be your guy
Just know that we will be alright, cause as lovers we'll prepare to fight

[Hook]

[Bridge: Stevie Hoang]
Now if you got someone that's worth fighting for
Don't let nobody hold you down
Let me hear you say "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
("Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh")
Say "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
("Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh")

[Iyaz]
And if you find someone that's worth dying for
The one you can't live without
Let me hear you say "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
("Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh")
Say "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
("Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh")

[Hook][Verse 1]
Mama, I found a plan
I love it, and you should understand
Papa, it’s quite a plan
It’s for me, and I’m its biggest fan
And don’t get me wrong
I know it’s not perfect, in your eyes
But somehow it’s flawless in mine

[Pre-Hook]
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can’t do that
I’m too far down to hold
You’ve got a hold on my soul

[Hook]
So I guess I’m a fool, I’m a fool in love girl
I’m willing to stay here and bask in the glory of my heart
I guess I’m a fool in love
But I’m willing to look so stupid 'till I've had enough

[Verse 2]
Mama, don’t judge me now
I’m not trying to hurt you but I know it won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
So tell me are you ashamed of how your little boy turned out?
You see a monster, I see a smile
You say it's danger and I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

[Hook][Verse 1]
Everybody tells me that you're pretty
And I always try to disagree, oh
To see you with another guy
Would tear me up deep inside
Cause they don't know you once belonged to me

[Pre-Hook]
And I know it would be awkward
Running into you that way
It was okay 'till you
Said that word to me

[Hook]
Oh no, you didn't just call me friend
Oh no, I must be hearing things
You can call me wrong, you can call me right
But don't you call me friend tonight
Oh no you didn't just say we're through
Oh no I ain't never getting over you
Tell me that I'm crazy chasing you again
But don't you call me friend
Don't you call me
Don't you, don't you call me
Don't you call me
Don't you call me friend
Don't you call me
Don't you, don't you call me
Don't you call me
Don't you call me friend

[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna lie you look so happy
Wish there was something I could still make you feel
Every smile makes me wanna fall apart
Every laugh is like a bullet to my heart
Cause I'm at the end of the room
Watching every guy coming at you

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
A friend don't think about you when he's dreaming
Or every single minute that he's breathing
So why is this so hard to believe
A friend won't do it all to try to please you
A friend can never kiss you when he sees you
And you know I won't, so just please don't call me friend

[Hook][Intro]
(Goodbye, goodbye)

[Verse 1]
I'm speaking from the heart, no shame
Since you up and left it has never been the same
Why would I lie, you never realize
That when I'm in your presence you would give me butterflies
Remember talking 'till four in morning
I would ask you if you're tired you said no with yawning
The next day, same thing
Oh, why did you have to go away?

[Hook]
And I just thought that you should know, you are always on my mind
And I can never let you go, not even if I try
And I can fill the deepest valleys with all the tears I cry
And I never wanna have to say (goodbye, goodbye)

If you could see how my heart cries
Cause I never wanna say goodbye
I can't let go even if I try
I don't wanna say (goodbye, goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Baby girl if you're listening to this
I made a little list with all the little things I miss
Your long hair, beauty eyes, super model lips
When you give my hand a squeeze every time that we kiss
When we're up late watching television
Just a couple of the things that I sit and reminisce on
And I will start to cry every time that you will cross my mind

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And I just want another chance
Forget about everything and just give me back romance
I love the way you move, I love the way you walk
The way your eyes close when you smile and you talk
And just the thought of me without you drives me insane
And it'll never be the same if I ever said (goodbye, goodbye)

[Hook][Verse 1]
Well, it was just two years ago
I met a girl in San Fransisco
Took her by the hand and I said "Hello"
And it was then that I could see
Just her reflection of natural beauty
Never would've thought she'd become my own

[Hook]
Oh, oh, you got my heart beating like a drum roll
And if you said it's over I'll be done, woah
Man, I swear my hands start shaking and my heartbeat's racing like
"Bum, bum, rupapabum, oh, bum, bum" My heart's beating like drums
"Oh bum, bum, rupapabum, oh"
My hand starts shaking and my heartbeat's racing like
"Bum, bum, rupapabum, oh, bum, bum" My heart's beating like drums
"Oh bum, bum, rupapabum, oh"
My hand starts shaking and my heartbeat's racing like

[Verse 2]
Well now two years have passed
And we had our ups and downs
Please I said you'll be up and gone
But you're still by my side
Said everything would be alright
I guess I'm trying to say would you be my wife?

[Hook]

[Bridge ×2]
Me heart's beating like a drum
Me temperature like a sauna
If you know what I'm talking about
Then let me hear you holla

[Hook]
