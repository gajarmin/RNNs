[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part...play your part."

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
(Sweet Jones)
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"[Intro]
Bun B: You ol' pussy-ass, cake-ass, punk-ass, trick-ass, sucker-ass, fuck-ass, dick-in-the-booty-ass, K-Y Jelly-packing-ass nigga
You better get your bitch ass up off the street, nigga
You got five seconds to get your hating ass up outta here, (Pimp C: Pouring up and showing up, bitch) cause it's some trill-ass niggas in this motherfucker
DJ Paul: Yeah, nigga, y'all know the motherfucking sco', y'all non-snorters, non-smokers, non-sippers, get the fuck up out of here, bitch
Bun B: Nigga, it's some sipping-ass, pouring up-ass, smoking-ass, getting high-ass niggas in here, Three 6, UGK, nigga, we putting it down in this motherfucker
DJ Paul: And we ain't playing witcha, y'all know the motherfucking sco', homie
Bun B: Now pour it up, nigga

[Hook: Project Pat]
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip (x8)

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I'm trill working the wheel, a pimp, not a simp
Keep the dope fiends higher than the Goodyear Blimp
We eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning
Fuck niggas make me sick with all that pinching and bargaining
You say that you a boss, I ain't believing that shit
You got the funny Geneva watch, with the Ferrari kit
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
I got the red promethazine, thick orange, and yellow tuss
Hydrocodone on the hands-free phone
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
If you got sixteen, you can get a bizzerd
I'm choking on that doja sweet and sipping on that sizzurp

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Niggas scared to flaunt it, some niggas, they want it, want it
Some niggas, they joning, joning, but I be fucked up up on it
We're with the Mafia 6, and we ain't 'bout that bullshit
If we gon' get high, we gon' get high, and we gon' house a bitch
Two niggas all at the mouth, two niggas all at the ass
And plus, that syrup have a nigga dick hard all night and she cool with that
She popped her a pill of X, and drank on some orange juice
And just when you thought she was freaking, she done got super loose
Niggas come in by threes and deuces, all in circles like duck-duck-goose
All that want it can bone it, she on that X and that tootie fruit
Forty dollars for just one ounce ounce, plus
Tussionex is how it's pronounced
Niggas sipping and dipping and tripping, man, I'm 'bout all out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
People always asking me, is the Three 6 high on that?
Rolling on them X pills, stuttering, pup-pup powder packs
Woah-wuh where the weed at, ain't like that we need that
NyQuil will slow me down, something that keep me easy
Nothing like that yella yella, that'll have you itching, man
Talking like, what's up, fool? Vocal chords sounding lame
In my days, all we did was chief out on a quarter pound
Gone on coke, eyes all bucked, this here shit'll knock you down
Knock you out, make you fall asleep when you're on them wheels
Ain't no doubt, hit me when I beep for this refill
Once again, on my weekly high, gotta have that drank
Yeah, my nig, y'ain't know? I feel like I'm gonna fucking faint

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Nigga, tell me what you know 'bout Frank, Nito, and Young Guido
Paul and Vito, we play a tune that's sweeter than Pedito
With my Three 6 niggas pouring up in my southern credo
Quick, fast, we'll put it on your ass like John Bido
Cause you fronting rap sangers, be creamy like a Zanger
You ain't from the manger, boy, but you gets the middle finger
Humdanger, rum dranker, occasionally take
Your bitch to the telly and be a dick and cum slanger
When Big Bun come danger, nigga, ring your alarm
Sexy thang on my arm, cup of drank in my palm
And that crazy shit, I'm tripping on some skinny bitches
Something that's wholesome, Florida to Folsom
For the most, I'm steady sipping on some sizzurp

[Hook][Intro: DJ Paul]
Yeeeeah!!
For the first time it's going down, history baby
New Three 6 Mafia, featuring Eightball and MJG, Young Buck
It's a Tennessee thing

[Hook: Juicy J]
I gotta stay high, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh
Till I die, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie
I gotta stay high, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh

Till I die, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
They call me the Juice and you know I'mma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part and be buying the bar

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies, we live them lives
And keep them eyes tight
Riding round what they like
Make a couple nuns, a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple and swallow it down with
The yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Puff, puff pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my g's
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po, close the window
When I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own cause them niggas there
Let me smoke for free

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
What's up Mary, how you doing
Mary Jane, stalking me
Since I have met you girl you ruled my brain
You stole my heart, right from the start
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the garden

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Eightball]
Primro, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and chocking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

[Verse 6: MJG]
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this and breath again a whole lotta weed but
I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, Eightball and MJG
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

[Outro: Juicy J]
I gotta stay high, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh[Intro: DJ Paul]
Hypnotize Minds, UGK!
Three 6 Mafia, another classic baby
Put some South in your mouth
It's goin down, what!

[Pimp C]
Sweet Jones
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for $40 in the club
Fuckin up the game, bitch ya gets no love
She be cross country, givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

{"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh I choose you girl, yeah..."}

[Bun B]
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World (world)
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl (girl)
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile (mile)
We pilin up the paper on the dinin room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable (fable)
We rock the freshest sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mac that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp? And what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose

{"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh I choose you girl, yeah..."}

[DJ Paul]
Now when they heard who in the club DJ Paul, bitches chosen up
When they see I'm icy like a slush, then they frozen up
Like my homie Project Pat we keep them cups raising up
Snizzow flizzake is off in my dollar, gotta nose it up
I dial drink by the liters, I'm a drinker ho
Ya swore you doin it like meeee? Youse a thinker ho
What you thinkin bro? Need to get your money way up
UGK and Three 6 Mafia got your girl trained up

[Juicy J]
I'm still trappin in hell, my pockets on swell
The number one D-boy, Mr. Fishscale
I don't fuck around, with snitches who tell
Put holes in your brain, leave bodies to smell
I'm out here gettin paid, ain't got time for jail
I paid off the judges, the juries, the sheriff
You know it's the Juice-man, never will fail
I'm still sippin' syrup, slow motion like snails

{"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh I choose you girl, yeah...
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, I choose you baby..."}[Hook]
Now every since I could remember I been poppin' my collar
Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Every since I could remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand

[Project Pat]
I know you sicker than sick-ahh
When you see the rims flick-ahh
Paint drip off
Ice in my Range glitt-ahh
I straight flippa
The cheese like pancake
Foldin' my cheese like the leaves
In my hand bricka?
Project Pat-ter
Attracted to dime pieces
I'm dirty southern
French braids, gold teeth
I'm out here makin' sense
Plus, I'm out here makin' dollars
I keep a bad broad, though
And a popped collar

[Hook]

[DJ Paul]
Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery
A lot of dudes swear they play, man they some fackery
Let me catch a girl up out some work in my site
And believe I'm gon be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryin to get paid however money is made
A lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me, I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model fa real

[Juicy J]
Well you know me by the Juice man hangin out with Big Triece
Standin on tha porch, drinkin liquor, drunk, smokin' weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet
Thats why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet
So I could get paid and relax in the shade
And say fuck a nine to five cuz a nigga tired of slavin
It's never easy for a playa in tha hood on tha come up
If I meet a gal with three kids or more she get done up

[Hook]

[Crunchy Black]
She's just another ho that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well go on head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper something in her ear if I could
I got some hoes out there bringin ya boy back some good
That ghetty green you know what I mean that bitch is understood
Ain't havin to shout at no motherfuckin slut
You know I'm actin bitch make cut a fuckin rug
You better get out there and get my money in the woods
I'mma hit cha in ya head and leave ya ass with a plug
You know I gotta have, gotta get my money what
These hoes out here be fucking for a muthafucking dub, FREAK BITCH!

[Hook][Hook] x2
You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

[Verse 1]
In my eyes I done seen some crazy things in the streets
Gotta couple hoes working on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like taking from a girl don't know no better, I know that ain't right
Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals
It's fucked up where I live, but that's just how it is
It might be new to you, but it's been like this for years
It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
I'm trying to get rich 'fore I leave up out this bitch
I'm trying to have things but it's hard fo' a pimp
But I'm praying and I'm hoping to God I don't slip, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man it seems like I'm ducking dodging bullets everyday
Niggas hating on me cause I got, girls on the tray
But I gotta stay paid, gotta stay above water
Couldn't keep up with my hoes, that's when shit got harder
North Memphis where I'm from, I'm 7th Street bound
Where people all the time end up lost and never found
Man these hoes think we prove things, leave a big head
They come hoping every night, they don't end up being dead
Wait I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you
That's the way the game goes, gotta keep it strictly pimping
Gotta keep my hustle tight, making change off these women, yeah

[Hook][Intro: Young Buck]
Uh-ooooh
Young Buck, T.I., Ludacris, DIRTY SOUTH, YEEEAH

[Hook: Young Buck]
I hear em talking but he bout to get that ass stomped
Watch I get the club crunk I'mma make em stomp
We ain't playin wanna front get that ass stomped
Do it like them dirty south boys do and stomp
Now where you from who the boss I'mma break em off
Where you from who the boss let me break em off
Where you from who the boss I'mma break em off
Where you from who the boss let me break em off

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm Cadillac'n through the hood; sittin' on 24s
TVs playin, rims spinnin - blowin plenty dro
Don't have to mention when you pimpin you get plenty hoes
It's all on you if you gon trick or you gon get ya dough
I know I got these haters mad - I can love that
When you got love for the streets they give you love back
Look in my eyes you can tell I ain't never scared
Poppin them thangs I'm rockin my chain anywhere
If you gon represent ya hood what you waitin on?
Security better back up when they play this song
And we bout 50 strong, please don't make us do you wrong
My clique is guerillas - they got they G-Unit's on
All of that mean muggin really don't mean nuthin
Come on and take it outside let me see somethin
Wh-wh-wh-what now don't get b-b-b-bucked down
Stop all that hatin or this club gon get ya shut down

Now where you from who the boss I'mma break em off
Where you from who the boss let me break em off

[Hook: Young Buck]

[Verse 2: T.I]
Ay 100 carats on my chest I'm so true to this
Task force got my vest I got a new one bitch
Feds hate and talk shit but I'm too legit
A million dollars at a time - till I'm super rich
Pimp squad, g-unit - fuck who you get
Ask ya nieces and ya nephews who tha shit
Real niggas see the difference 'tween you and this
Me getting beat down that's ludicrous
My name rang from the streets and span to Mechanicsville
Nigga, all you gettin' is Rodney Dangerfield
I know respect; I'mma vet - you could bet that
I caught some cases but that's just a minor setback
And if I have to do some time I be right back
Wit some bi's and some tri's and a six-pack
We hit the do' watch all the pussy niggas get back
They know we could do it like tha row but you ain't wit that
You know who make the track bump like the king of crunk
These choppers hit you bitches, wish you got ya ass stomped

[Hook: Young Buck]

[Verse 3: Game]
G-G-G-unit! Coming straight outta Compton
Lace up my G-6's, and I'm A-Town stomping
Got ten thousand cash in my pocket, let the pump in
Cause Luda and Young Buck always getting me into somethin'
Low rider out front, I'm trying to get into somethin'
Step on Banks shoe one more time and Im'a start busting
Rolls gold in my grill, I gotta dirty mouth
And a bitch with a fat ass from the dirty, dirty south
I wasn't trying to get the cover of the Double XL
Just trying to fuck Mia, cause Dre said sex sells
Don't be mad at the rocks in my fucking chain
Don't be mad cuz your bitch chose Buck And Game
You see the logo tatted on my neck
Same one I'm autographing on the chest
Put your bottles in the air for Yayo, he on house arrest
And on behalf of 50 Cent this is G-Unit West

Now, stomp! G-G-G-G-Unit!
Now, stomp! G-G-G-G-Unit!

[Hook: Young Buck]

[Verse 4: Ludacris]
Yeah!
Muthafucker I'm a monster in this game, similar to the Loch Ness
My rhymes are nappy rooted - some verses gotta process
The truth in this booth; ain't no doubts when I'm rappin'
If I say it I've either done it or it's 'bout to happen
When I pull up in the Louis truck on 26's people dumb out
If life's a crap game I'm Rollin 7's on the come out
These rappers think I'm ig'nant, love saying my name
Cause maintaining my fish tank and they house cost the same
Ask me I say I made it and it sho wadn't luck
But cause hustlers relate to me and some are younger than buck
You see I'm married to my music but we got a pre-nup
So if that bitch don't act right I'm still gettin my cut
My deals never get screwed; my contracts practice abstinence
A master in this program, hazing these undergraduates
So pimpin', be easy; quit catchin' feelings
Cause you worth a couple hundred grand, and I'm worth millions
Nobody thinkin' bout you; plus your beef ain't legit
So please stay off the T-I-P of my dick

[Hook: Young Buck][Chorus: Lord Infamous (Sample Looped)]
(Smoke a sack)
I think I smoked a thousand blunts (6x)

Pimp tight, pimp tight, pimp tight, young black nigga, pimp tight (x3)

So come and get some 187 invitation (3x)
Burial, burial, burial, burial, burial insurance and some hospitalisation

[1st Verse]
I unload the ammo, fire glows
Blood stains on your neck
Pours out your nose
Your life passes right before your eyes
Scarecrows dangerous, you did not realize
You don't know just where you're been taken
All the bones in your body I will break it
I am Lord Infamous, death is my method
Murder murder I just can't help it
Me and my niggas shoot gats
Like we're in a war
Smokin' up some bustaz bitch
That's what we came for
Scarecrow is tellin' you niggas
Who got a damn problem
Yo busta you betta be steppin'
Before I roll up on yo ass and you
Feel the full strength when I'm
Blastin' my murda weapon
I don't think you wanna fuck with us, playa
I'll shoot yo ass then push you down some stairs
You wanna test the Triple 6 Mafia mane
You best forget it, and fuck a nigga
Who got a goddamn problem with it
Bitch!

[Bridge]

Burial insurance and some hospitalisation
So come and so come and get some 187 invitation

[2nd Verse]
Dead body cremator
Scarecrow I'm burnin' them bodies up in the inferno
Listen to Infamous' lyrical twists as I
Show with the tongue with the turbo
Verbal, mark us abide with a feelin' no
Feelin' these verses the surface
The victim is gettin' real nervous he know that I'm killin'
When gettin' those urges don't be my next target
Niggas are leavin' they blood stains all over the carpet
Butcher bullshit-rappers all in around in the fucked up apartment
Those suckers are starvin'
They go on a journey through Infamous terrible garden
He standing somewhere in those woods
And he ready to tear your fucking ass apart man
When you walk through the wilderness be very quiet
Lord Infamous might be ass stompin'
I suggest you watch out for the booby traps man
Cause the Scarecrow is out there yea only for huntin'
You can't escape it, be a man and take it
Snatch your head up by your vertebrae
And let it with your artery shakin', penetrating your face
And bow and arrow in your bone marrow
Scarecrow, I flow, vicious, motherfuckin' tell tha ho
Tear a ho, legs I've cut 'em up and stick em' in some purses
Lord Infamous bitch, run up,  if ya got a problem wit

[Outro]
So, so come and get some 18 so come and get some 18

Act like you know me, when I ask ya let me hit the shorts
Act like you know me, if I holla and front ya boy a key

Act like you know me, when you see the platinum on my wrist
Act like you know me, when you know that I done took yo bitch
Act like you know me, if you know that I been husslin'
Act like you know me, rock for rock the record business man
Act like you know me, if I pull the strap and bring the pain
Act like you know me, if you see me on them twanky thangs
Act like you know me, when that fire shit is all we smoke
Act like you know me, if I tell ya nigga hit this dope
Act like you know me, when I'm winnin in this dice game
Act like you know me, if I tell yo' ho dont touch the grain
Act like you know me, if I tell you niggas bring it on
Act like you know me, point'n in yo face a fuckin tone

Chorus

[DJ Paul]
Act like you know me, cause I'm armed with guns and ready to bum
Act like you know me, cause I bring the war like Vietnam
Act like you know me, when you see me cruising were you lay

Chorus[Intro]

[Versul 1: Bitza, Grasu XXL]
Daca nu mai am bani, iau pe datorie
Ca sa dau pe gat un strop de bucurie
Si cand nu mai vreau sa mai am de nimic habar
Imi inec intotdeauna gandu-ntr-un pahar
Problemele sunt plecate departe
Lucrurile mi se par frumoase toate
N-are ce sa fie rau, are ce sa fie bine
Ai pe cer Carul Mare si vaca langa tine!
Ohhhhhh!
Noroc, Grasule!
Noroc, Bitza!
Am facut commando de omorat sticlele
Am cateva ore ca sa fiu beat
Stiu ca maine vine alta zi de cacat
Nu ma preocupa asta, stiu ca toate trec
Si-mi las ceasul la bar pe-o suta de Jack
Bag ultima doza de ucis amaru'
Mi-au umplut cu lacrimi ingerii paharul

[Refren: Bitza]
Lasa sa curga
Sticla sa planga
Arunca zarul
Decat sa ma minta altii mai bine paharul!

[Versul 2: Grasu XXL, Bitza]
Uite ce fata observata printre toate care-mi plac
Toate imi plac, nu exagerat, ele ma fac sa uit de cacat
Pe toate le ard, pe toate le trag
Pe toate le sting, pe toate le aprind
Sa strige lumea Grasule, fii mai succint !
Nu te mint, nu te mint, nu te mint, nu...
Sigur vorbeste vinu' Bitza, sau vorbesti tu?
Sunt Grasu X, e cum am promis, si daca s-a stins
Mai ai din kilu' ala care l-am trimis

[Versul 3: K-Gula]
Cand nu ma regasesc, probabil n-am multe de-ales
Iau o blonda grasa de pe masa, frant de necazuri sa ma-ndepartez
Sunt tras sau beat, rupt in cur sau spart in cap
Daca-i o blonda langa mine, de tot ce-a fost pe loc am uitat
Bitza, unde-i kilu' ala de la Grasu? Da-l incoa'!
Inca un pahar nu pot refuza
Chiar daca nu rezolv nimic asa
Termin si sticla asta fara sa jur ca va fi ultima

[Versul 4: VD]
N-am nevoie sa fiu treaz, stii ca beau fara frica
Nu-i nevoie de clip fiindca-s des pe sticla
Cat despre sticla, nu prea am voie in exces cica
Numa' ca n-am nici un amic treaz ca sa mi-o zica
Si cand ma-mbat fac haos, ti-a prezis si Nostradamus
Iti demolez localul, spune-mi secretul lui Bachus!
Vad starlete, dar daca-o sa se-mbete
Le vezi tratand toalete ca pe cel mai bun prieten

[Refren]Yea, yea, ya'll kno wut time it is... sum mo Tripl 6 shit for yo muthafuckin

One cold winter of many tales
Trails of blood left in frozen snow
A family slaughtered by a loved one, forgive scarecrow
I turned against God and everything that I cared for most
Police arrived, candle light, butcher knives, bloody bedposts
Found staked on the floor soaked in evidence of the root of violence
Only a teen, sent to spend my final life in an insane asylum
So a few years have passed, I'm an adult I feel better now
But no matter, I tell them that I know they'll never let me out
I rot in this dread, my only world's the one in my head
I hate psycho-therapists, I walk amongst walking dead
Everday, yes every-single day, peepin' ways to escape
I got to find a way out this place, it's a must, got to find a way
I'm pullin hair up out my freakin' head yo
They tranquilize a nigga put his ass in a choke
I wanna go psycho and kill these mutha fuckin' folks
But in a padded room I know I'll never get up out this hole
I'm pacin' back and forth across this room
I gotta think of somethin, man I got to make a move
The day I killed my fuckin' family in a week or two
I got to get up back out there I wanna do it again fool
Gettin' cool with the old ass maintenance man
I told him "If you help me out I'd put a lotta papes in your hand
I stashed a lotta dough in dirt before a nigga left it
If you help me out when I get out I'll give you half on that deal"
The old man with it, he grinnin', astray
Look here gramps, meet me at my door for the plan round 'bout 8
Check it pops, you got to get a shovel and a pine box
Put me in the ground and dig me out once they talk to the cops
I'm gonna need a slight overdose of some mother fuckin' sleepin' pills
So while I'm waitin in the dirt I won't breathe up the air in here
Sneak in the office get the keys off of Dr. Malique
And while you doin that I'll take the pills so I fall asleep
I started feelin' my awareness fadin' away
I could slightly hear all the dirt gettin' tossed on to the pine crate
I awoke and in my square waiting to be freed
But from the light I seen
Someone killed the maintenance man and threw him in with me

I'm scared, is anyone out there?
Damn, I'm scared is anyone out there?
I'm scared, is anyone out there?
Damn, I'm scared is anyone out there?[Hook: DJ Paul][x2]
Beacon and a blender

And ever since then I can't stand to see a bitch with a dollar

[Hook]

{Verse 2: Lord Infamous}
One day me and Paul was chillin in the cut dog, jus glidin

Rollin blunts and bumpin
Paul ask the bitch you wanna hit the hotel or something?
The hoes were with it so we fell up in the La Corte
And we smokin mega blunts and sippin on that grape fruit Gin
Now the bitches fucked up and the Scarecrow spittin crazy game
Paul in the corner gettin his dick sucked by the otha dame
Now I got the stallion comin on up out them draws
Oh lord now its type to bang the walls, bang the walls
Now we through but I still think the hoes dont get the picture
Fired up the roach and hit the rest of the liquor
(So whats up where you want us to drop you off to?)
Next thing I know she comin out her purse with a deuce, deuce
I started bustin, with the 80 out the ankle holster
Two wounded bitches in the hotel fuckin with LoCstaz

[Hook][Intro: Project Pat]
Yeah it's Project Pat in this thang

You gettin' that money you gotta keep gettin' that cheese man
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook x2]
The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose
The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose

[Verse 1 - Project Pat]
The gutta, the hood, the drugs, what's cookin'?
The guns, the mask, the young broads hookin'
The grams, the zones, the hundred for the tens
The county, the state, the fed-e-ral pen
Police in them high speeds now that's where I been
Ya left ya house unattended, was breakin' in
Old heads 'round the way say I need to cease fire
Cocaine habit like, water to the grease fire
Nines, big pinky rangs, flashy like King Tut

Candy paint, on the cars, hazelnut wood
Twenty fo' inch floaters floatin' through the hood

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Juicy J]

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Project Pat]
I been gettin' money from the crumbs to the purse snatchin'
I kept a mask on wit' the guns click-clackin'
Project was straight jackin' drug dealers to the fiends
I wasn't comin' up I had dreams of comin' clean
About this ghetty green, night and day I plot and scheme
Was in the project sellin' pills sippin' lean
Nigga I'm hustlin', where the bullets never ceaseful
It's always gunplay, cause ya mouth stay in grease-ful
Get a treeful, my candy like Honeydew
They see me in my car, dog, this what money do

Kush inbetween my index and my thumb, exhale from my lungs
Load the Tommy Gun, split the tongues, kill them one by one
Dump all the body parts into my trunk

[Verse 9: Point Blank]
Didn't give a fuck about yesterday, don't give a fuck today
And tomorrow I'm probably going to feel the same fucking way
They love you when I hit it, hate me when I miss it
So much yack in system you can smell it when I'm pissing
I smoke like a broke down engine, I love my money like I love my women
Let me show you how to whip it, let me show you how to pack it
Let me show you how to sell it, let me show you how to stack it
Pillow talking with these rest might get you excited
But don't let the pillow talk get you green lighted
Now I'm in the mix with the Mafia Six, but I breathe H-Town
I'mma die coalition, coalition
Told you once, told you a million motherfucking times
I'm like a shredder, don't get caught up in my fucking grind
Mix me with that shit, it's the wrong night
Body parts, hope it's them bitch niggas I don't like

[Verse 10: JGRXXN]
Monkey ass niggas sit banana clips (aye)
And water niggas 'bout to make me click (them)

Don't give a fuck about friends, them niggas hit in

If you step in our way killaz attack motherfucker
But yall know yall done heard all that befo
Yall done seen the Fo-fos and folks kick in ya doe
You done seen the gauge pump bout to see a Chevy trunk
Lights out next to the Mississippi River plumped up
Tape hog tied wrong place wrong time
Hypnotized Minds trick knocked ya up off ya grind

[Lil Chrome]
All my muhfuckers you niggas should already know

We smoke the best of dro while she down wit some Jack-Jack
My eyes like the red carpet still on the blue side

[Project Pat]
They locked me up just like 2Pac and I went plat-ti-num
Laid it down for a calendar I'm right back at them
Took my game then weighed it up on a triple beam
Niggas rob kill steal for the ghet-ty green
U.S.. Marshal at my folks house want to kill me dead
Wanna see me in a pine box bullet in my head
I'm was like "I ain't did shit why you hatin this?"
Ghetto thugs know my rap songs they relate to this

[DJ Paul]
I been doin this too long to still be strugglin livin like this
Fuckin off with major labels slayed me like a bitch
And these got cheese and ride on Rolls it mean hoes
But still on the road doin free shows
Tryna get a few spins in a few spots
I growed up back in the day I wouldn't use my Glock
I hear a lotta corny shit on the radio
Thats because they record company wouldn't spend dough
Yeah my label got a hook up wit MTV
But they just keep forgettin to tell 'em bout me
They try to play like it's love and its family
But all my marketing dollars goin to {****}
Tear Da Club Up was the first Crunk fight song
I made that in 92 a lil not long
That it took 10 million sold and we still ain't on
That's why Three 6 is the MOst Known Unknowns...[Intro: DJ Paul]
Yelawolf, DJ paul, Rittz
The rapping homies
SLUMERICAN!

[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yeah, this one is for the bowties
DJ Paul, Yela

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I'm in a black chevrolet with no tags
Got doors on this bitch like a school bus
Hop on in motherfucker
Take you for a ride with a loaded ruger
So cold that I might need a coat rack
Look bitch you only need two puffs
That's crystal meth Catfish Billy smokin' tulips
All around the south I blow cash
That ain't leather that's nubuck
You ain't really ballin' ruthless
You ain't rollin' up on a new truck
I'm all about the Glock, fuck LoJack
I got this bitch on four's like two plus
Two and this bitch is lubed up
Treat MC's like a used slut
Yeah bitch I'm outtie
Five go tell yo' pap' that his boy's said howdy
You want to make it rain but would I, I doubt it
These hoes are bad weather, always cloudy
I'm a kill these bitches dig these ditches and
Rocks up out this chevy trunk before you dead and lost
Cause we peelin' off in that red Bugatti with bowties

[Hook]

(Oh, oh!) just me and that chevrolet (Bowties)
(Oh, oh!) with a motherfuckin' attitude (Bowties)
(Oh, oh!) you don't want to see that pistol wave (Bowties)
(Oh!) Me and that box running up clean and smooth (Bowties)

[Bridge: DJ Paul]
Turn the fuck up!
Rittz where you at?
Yelawolf, DJ Paul
Where the Chevy riders at?
Bring up, lets go!

[Verse 2: Rittz]
All black Chevy I'm a take it to the car show
Shouldn't drink and drive, I got some chrown inside my console
Blonde ho with me, 'bout to fuck, no time for convo'
Horny because I let her hit the chronic and the blanco
Long stroke, I'm known for swinging wood like I'm a golf pro
Hit it from the back she look behind and saw my charm glow
I took a picture of her pussy for a fact and finished
So she got the steppin' like she learned to do the mambo
Back inside my seat my speakers beatin' like a bongo
Bumpin' Box Chevy me and 'Wolf a perfect combo
Anyone want it with us can get it they beggin' for attention
Like Miley Cyrus when she twerk and let her tongue show, dumb though
Why you blaming us when you done gone broke
Rap's killing shit like Matt Dillon did in Gunsmoke
I'm just fired up while you gettin' dried up like an ancho
Chili but really still feelin' like I'm on my grind though
So I'm creepin' like a rhino, coming off the exit ramp
Northside Atlanta and I got it, want to get a gram
Servin' out my window like a worker on a Checker stand
Used to be a fan now they fucked it up and let me in
Leather interior until they get another print
Of my shoes, hit the runway inside my Chevy then
Hit the gas till the moon we will never land
Ain't nobody fuckin' with Slumerican put that on my Chevy

[Hook]

[Bridge: Yelawolf & DJ Paul]
Yeah ho
Dj Paul, Yelawolf
Motherfucker
Turn it motherfucking up
Bitch!

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Walk to the mall like fuck you
Give me that Mickey D Super Sized
Got a fresh pair of J's like two new crack heads
Shoelaces like Footloose, bounce on it
Coffee table full of shake and they breakin' up an ounce on it
Tweakers and the clique gettin' high as a brimstone
Thrown from the tip of the volcano, they sip on
Lean some of them lean on the wall and limp home
Steam mellowin' out of a Chevrolet Enzo
I put the house on it
Have a seat bitch put the couch on it
Take a sigh bitch I put the south on it
Take a ride in the 1989
You talkin' shit I might put the crowd on it
It would be another Yelawolf hate ground
Butter on the seats like country crop
But I fuckin' ain't no country crop
Puts fear in the heart of a country cop
Everytime that I get fuckin' stopped
Boy them some nice wheels but you better turn the music down
Cause it ain't the big city
Ran off the law with nothin' but a ticket
From a fuckin' hick with a stick and midget dealin' with midget and bowtie

[Hook](Hook: Lil Wyte)

Break-break-break da knob off, ain't no turning down
Ain't no turning down
Ain't no turning down
Ain't no turning down (2X)
For-for-for-for what?
For what?
For what?
For what?
For-for-for what?
For what?
Ain't no turning down (2X)

(Verse 1: Lil Wyte)

I'm-I'm turnt up to the maximum, liquor flowin' and kush blowin'
And OG Wyte is what we smoke and Michigan is where its grown
And popped another half a bar, now I am a xanimal
Looking for a free tee, tonight I am a canibal
Two-two mollies, orange juice I'm loose cause I'm on crown and goose
I'm super trippy, vision blurry, I barely know what I should do
My heart is pumping, pupils vibrating back and forth inside my head
I still go harder than most of the people I know and I know I should be dead
On the other side of the galaxy, I'm sitting on Jupiter's moon
I'm out my fucking mind high, and I ain't coming down no time soon
Shout out to Juicy J cause he passed me in a flying saucer
Now its knob broken my right shoulder is where I just toss em

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Jelly Roll)

Yeaaaah

Hit the club and turn it up, throw that bag and burn a blunt
Its hot as fuck up in this club, I swear to God I'm burning up
(Wooo!) I'm-I'm on my level (Wooo!) I'm-I'm high as fuck
Wake up in the morning, feeling like I got hit by a truck
Yeah-yeah bitch, you know and this is what I do ho
I popped another molly now I'm on my way to Pluto
I’m bouncing through the club with my middle fingers up
Singing "If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck"
I got people over here, I got people over there
Start a riot in this bitch, fuck around and throw a chair
Would you beat em to the floor in the club? I sho will
Hottest white boy in the game, and I did it with no deal
Totem bitch!

(Hook)[Chorus]
Break da law, break da law...

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Nigga recognize them Triple 6 shit

We gotta lay it down
We gotta spray
We gotta break ya bitch
Comin' up stays on my mind
So we gotta drop a busta
A playa hatin' nigga or a crooked cop
Run up
If ya wanna
It ain't no thang I put my gun up
Midnight to sun up
Still break you manne in that M
Tha M-Town
Niggas get buck non-stop
Fuck off and learn the real meanin of a plastic Glock
G Gotta touch 'em gotta grab 'em cuz I think hes bailin
L Lay 'em down no remorse come with me to hell
O Overnight we be rich when we tell the trick
C Catch ya slippin' he's so soft do a man quick
K Killas on my payroll I gotta stay straight

Slaw in Memphis Tennessee
We down to break da law bitch..

[Hook]
Break da law, break da law...
Comin up from the backbuckin' niggas down
Comin comin up from the back buckin' niggas down
Comin up from the back buckin' niggas down
Cause when you duck we hit you with the bat

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Pass me tha Glock so I can get buck
A mean frown stay on my face cuz I dont give a fuck
Loced out afro
And a big Fila coat
14 carat gold
Smile and a bone around my throat
Glock 19 is tucked nicely down my fruit of the looms
For them niggas that trick it in
Im stickin' up them tracks they boom
Shakin' like a mothafucka when I lock you down tight
In tha Chevy trunk with nothin' but next to dig for yo life
Fool it ain't no game you gotta die the devil sent me
Six in yo chest who's next?
No niceness in me
Tha killas up in my crew they take no shit
Niggas you better run
We bout it bitch
No nigga dont play
[We roll with automatic guns]
Step up with the ho shit
Nigga we gotta close shop
[Juice on the bugler do a 9 leavin' you hoes to rott]
Big cam with a punk
Malekie with a attitude
Smith & Wesson in his hand
Blowed tha bitch out his shoes
Break da law

[Hook]

[Juicy J]
*repeat x4*
Southside Northside Westside Eastside

Get buck mothafucka Get Buck...[Hook]

The haters or the suckas you can call them what you wanna
I just got off of paper so im back on marijuana
I wanna be the boss the only way to do is to take it
I find you stealing from me playa I can't let you make it
You niggas see I came up when I was outta jail
The man up above showed me love it never failed
A drought on street music now it's time to get rich
You niggas out here with that ?? end up in a ditch
The K will spray like a water hose on a snitch
Bullets flying niggas dying like the wicked witch

When they talk beef stay strapped with that heat nigga
To hell with rapping we can settle this in the street nigga

See the 20 inch Pirelli's roll mane thank the vogues
Dodgin all my foes ridin Caddy truck wit dvd
A flock of broads follow me from the club to break they knees
Knowin that's all I want straight out the club
The rest ain't smellin right the last thang on they mind is freshin up
It's goin down tonight, weave in they head
Weed in they purse, still crunk
Baby seeds all across the back, with coals in the trunk

[Verse 4: Juicy J]

[Hook][Hook: repeat 4X]
CLICK! Bang bang {*repeat 3X*}
CLICK! Bang bang to yo' motherfuckin brain ho

[Verse One]
I told them haters hate on, Three 6 Mafia strong
Stronger than ever ever since they've been gone, I've been better
FUCK THEM FAKERS and them tag-along fakers
Smilin in my face but got my enemy on your MySpace
I cain't understand how these niggas live with theyself
Deal with theyself, what they need to do is kill theyself
BLAOW~! Suicide is a good {?} ano
At your funeral for free, I play the piano
Rest in pieces you niggas shriek like breezes
Got mo' crosses than churches, heart smaller than a fetus
You need us, you're nuttin, you're zero, you're zip, you're nada
I'm 22 on the Rolls, you da hubcaps on an Impala

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I'mma creep up on this fool, put this gun to his head
Tell him give me all your jewelry, all your dope, all your bead
All the coke that you brought in, the weed that you brought in
And if I cain't get answers say hello, to my lil' friend
You fakin like you ball and brawl and shotcall
I'm that fool that break jaws and all the state laws
Stupid rappers get your check, buy rims and what's next?
Need to get a place to live, a crib, cause you ain't shit
With your mixtapes, niggas hate, say they real, but they ain't
Catch them somewhere face to face, then they run from place to place
Club hoppin, mall shoppin, gettin hot, sales dropppin
Now you wanna sober up and tell these niggas you got fucked

[Hook][Hook]
Inside, inside, inside, inside that funk, can hypnotize, hypnotize
Dead a nigga dead they said
A nigga dead a nigga dead
It's in my fuckin' head

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Late nights I cruise in my Chevrolet
Scopin' out the houses where those stay
Who don't pay the fizz-ines to Triple 6
Twice and never make a house call bitch
Murder is all on my mind, so I grab my plastic nine
I'm foister on the low-low where my soul sent me
Some shit now look deep into my eyes
And plus the Devil's in me
Don't try to offense the
Six to the third power see
Don't cross that set bitch I'll stang you once
In front of these machine... guns, we point... don't run
It's kinda hard to duck, when I start to buck, buck
I bet you won't get buck, you fuck ass niggas
I catch you slippin', I gets to clippin'
And then we push back my fuckin' trigga
Happy and figga what nigga I've come to destroy you
Your old DJ and fool I enjoyed you
But now it's time to cut the shit
You been tricked, now witness...
Witness my crucifix

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Crucifix spread with bloody red all on my pillow
Fool moved by my window so I call my nigga Scarecrow
Croomy got the nine inside fine
Yeah cause Knicc ain't goin'
I constantly fight these demons, but I'm startin' to see he's winnin'
No witness in the dark
I start to rip some hearts up in them parts
Where's your God, where's your God, oh where's your fuckin' God?
Soon or later playa days'll come with many greater
Robbers, killers, cocaine dealers, the realest
Enormous haters
I'm wagin', awaitin' them demons in the fuckin' basement
Leavin' niggas shakin when they face the face of Satan
Ten safens in thy casket mend the soul and then I grasp it
That's all they got too far and then
The hurt deepens and crackens
Me Juicy and Paul mane
Was rollin' in the fuckin lone
Headed to a muthafuckin ritual
Where I never tell nobody but somebody wouldn't know
Ya sold ya soul what's the cost
You hoes was scared bitch
Robbin' these bitches and make me some riches
Invite 'em to my crucifix

[Hook x3](Project Pat)
Straight from the projects
North Memphis my stomping ground
You bitches don't make a move
You niggas don't make a sound
Get blown if you wanna ho
Don't fuss at the sawed-off ho
A hole through yo head though
Lay yo mammy on the flo
Crack rock for them crack fiends
Some tones for them robbers
My fingerprints on the shells
So I keeps a revolver
This song about selling dope
Cross niggas with chump change
We stick a yawk in your face
And blow out your damn brains
We gone off that whitey-white
It get you high as a kite
I'm soaring high with the birds
I'm smoking the hydro herb
It's plentiful down here
Smoking weed and drinking beer
Get to mixing vodka
My nig' with the Everclear
If pockets get empty
Then I gotta take some
I slap you with 44
You know I'm gone break some
You start seeing stars
And wondering who done took your shit
When I ain't got cheese
I'm like a fiend having crack fits

(Chorus):
A bitch act up in the club
I see his ass in the lot (x7)
A bitch act up in the club
See you in the parking lot, nigga

(Project Pat)
You lames talking smack
Get done in my nig'
Shot in the back
And drug in a ditch
Pistol-a smack
Spit up teeth and blood
Cock back the gat
Yo face in the mud
Cops they get mad
No-body got caught
Get a-way clean
Put jewelry in vault
Keep something, work
And got to make cheese
All bitches hating
Can hit they knees
Turn up the volume
Pump up the snare and
Drank on the bottle
While smoking Mary
Don't pop a pill, bitch
Knocked out on X
The dick hard as hell
But like I been hexed bitch
Gone off that shit
This weed got me going
Nose kinda raw so
I start to blowing
Fucked on your gal
And you know she going
I'm drunk as hell
From drinking the moet

Where you hoes at
Where you hoes at
Where you hoes at
Where you hoes at
Where you hoes at
Where you hoes at
Where you hoes at
(Continues...)

(Chorus)
A bitch act up in this club
I see his ass in the lot (x3)
A bitch act up in this club
See you in the parking lot

Get buck, get buck
Get buck, get buck
Get buck, get buck
(Fades out)
