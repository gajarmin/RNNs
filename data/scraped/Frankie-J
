[Intro: Frankie J.]
So tight, so fly
You got me lifted
You got me lifted

[Hook: Frankie J]
Got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooohwee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly

[Bridge: Baby Bash]
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Off top, I can't lie, I love to get blowed
You my little sugar, I'm your little chulo
And every time we kick it
It's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky ickey
Or my sweet oooh-wee, gooey (Fa real, though)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Baby Bash
Now, I ain't worried about a thang cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a superfly chick
And uh-uh ad there ain't nothin' you can say to a player
Cause doo wop
She fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly, like a dove, fly, like a raven
Quick, to politic with some fly, conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce & Gabbana, with hydro in a Cubana

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Baby Bash]
Fa real, though

[Hook]

[Baby Bash]
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
Azucar(Check check ...this happened for real ...baby bash..yo.. frankie j.... obession)

Well it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I dont know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I dont know if it's right
I'm tossin turning in my bed
It's 5 oclock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak...
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...

[Hook]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Now I know you're not my lady
But I'm just tryin to make this right
I dont know what to do I'm going out of my mind
So baby if you let me
Kick it witchu well than maybe we could ride together
We could do this all nite
Now I dont care if you got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cuz I know he can't love you right, quite like I can
It's 5 oclock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak...
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love

[Hook]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
It's an obsession

[Baby Bash]
Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin less surene
Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got alot of money, I love to spend it
And thats whats up and I dont care what people scream
You're my blessin when I'm stressin
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cuz my ma know how I do
We go rendez-vous
Mi corazon belongs to you

[Hook]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong) what am I do wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
What am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong?) what am I do so wrong? [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Amor[Verse 1:]
He drops his suitcase by the door
She knows her daddy won't be back anymore
She drags her feet across the floor
Trying to hold back time, to keep him holding on
And she says

[Pre-Chorus:]
Daddy daddy don't leave
I'll do anything to keep you right here with me
Can't ou see how much I need you
Daddy daddy don't leave
Mommy is saying things she don't mean
She don't know what she's talking 'bout
Somebody hear me out..

[Chorus:]
Father,listen,tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father,save him,I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room,try hard in school
I'll be good, I promise you
Father,father,i pray to you

[Verse 2:]
Now she hasn't slept in weeks
She don't want to close her eyes
Cause she's scared that he'll leave
They've tried just about everything
But it's gettin harder for him to breathe
And she says

[Pre-Chorus:]
Daddy daddy don't leave
I'll do anything to keep you right here with me
Can't ou see how much I need you
Daddy daddy don't leave
The doctors are saying things they don't mean
They don't know what they talking 'bout
Somebody hear me out..

[Chorus:]
Father,listen,tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father,save him,I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room,try hard in school
I'll be good, I promise you
Father,father,i pray to you

[Hook:]
Please don't let him go
I'm begging you so
There,open his eyes
Need a little more time
To tell him that i love him
More than anything in the world
Is daddy's little girl

[Chorus:]
Father,listen,tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father,save him,I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room,try hard in school
I'll be good, I promise you
Father,father,i pray to you

She was daddy's little girl........[Verse 1]
I don't need this, all I need is us - come on girl let's put it in the wind
I don't care none about no one, if they loved us they should it did it when
They had a chance but now the dance is over and fa sho its our way time
Let the top down, we can't stop now, explain the past - baby I ain't tryin
I ain't lyin, when I say we done came of age and when thangs done changed
Time to spread our wings, fly to better things, pack ya suitcase todays the day
Don't tell ya momma don't tell ya sister it'll only complicate the issue
We'll mail 'em a box of tissues, the only one that loves you is right here with you
Girl don't ever look back, our destiny awaits us
And whatever place we pump the brakes I'll work my hands to the bone n just what it takes to
Give us everything our folks never had, I'm prepared for that
It may take a while but Ima make ya smile forever I said a prayer for that and
I know he's listenin atleast to this one, if you never heard none of the others
This is me and you and Im'a see it through from this highway to under the covers, baby!

[Hook]
Oohhhhh Hoooooo!
I wanna run away with you (I wanna run away, I wanna run away)
I wanna run away with you (cuz baby your my everything)
I wanna run away with you (I wanna run away, I wanna run away)
I wanna run away with you (cuz baby your my everything)

[Verse 2]
We got off the exit in Waco, Frankie J was on the radio
I asked her was she afraid to go all the way with this, she delayed to know
I said baby I just need to know, if you ain't down we can turn around
Your happiness is my happiness and thats the only thing thats concernin me now
Just hurt me now, she said "would you please just let me talk for once?"
Then all at once she went in to how she been tryin to prevent this all for months
Not at all because she didn't love me and only me, it's just that she
Had withheld one vital piece of info, she looked up at me
With both eyes full of tears, she said "you remember that day at the clinic?
I went in with the doctor and told you I did it? I wasn't able to go through with it"
No you didn't, how could you? Wait a minute, that makes you what?
3 months and some change, well baby doll that just ain't enough
To derail us cuz see, that just means there's three of us
But answer this, at what point did you think this topic should be discussed?
I don't know whether to cry or smile, but somehow I'm doin both
But this changes nothin, I got 2 babies and I solemnly swear to be true to both, baby!

[Hook]

[Bridge - Frankie J]
I wanna run, wanna run away
There's nothin they can do or say to make us stay
I wanna run, wanna run away
There's nothin they can't do, there's nothin they can't say
I wanna run, wanna run away
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wanna run, wanna run away
I wanna run away, baby

[Hook][Frankie J.]
Yay, yay
Alright

Chorus: Frankie J

Oooh, baby girl, I love the taste
Got me livin' my fantasy
Baby, come and dance for me

Let your thong slide to the side, chica, open wide
And let my fine ass baby mama put her tongue inside
Tongue kissin', naked to the world
Such a nasty girl
You got me fiendin' every time I'm dreamin' of the pearl
Twice Last Night, once in the mornin', that's your favorite song
It turns you on, leave your pumps on, baby, watch me hit it strong

Smokin' on purp', of that purple grassy

Repeat Chorus Twice

Cause all I give you dirty tricks, and that's it
No shame in the game I play

I got the eye of an eagle
And I spot 'em
Hah

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Don Cisco]
It's me at the Holiday Inn, Howard Johnson

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Baby Bash
Now, I ain't worried about a thang cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a superfly chick
And uh-uh ad there ain't nothin' you can say to a player
Cause doo wop
She fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly, like a dove, fly, like a raven
Quick, to politic with some fly, conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce & Gabbana, with hydro in a Cubana

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Baby Bash]

Body's picture perfect like she's shaking it for my camera

Pretty lady so fine she blew my mind
Oh why

[Hook - Frankie J, Mannie Fresh:]
I've been around the world
And seen so many girls
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a Coke bottle
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it [6X] Snap
Shake it [5X] bring it back
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl

[Frankie J:]
I think she knows that I'm tryna get at her
I'mma go ahead and try to put in words
What's your name, what's your number, can I hit you up?
If you digging what I'm saying

So baby let me know if I can take you home (take you home)
I just wanna be somewhere where we're alone, alone

Over seas, the girls I've seen
But none compare to you baby
I've been around the world and back
And never seen a girl like that
Now it's clear to me that you're that girl for me

[Chamillionaire:]
And then she looks at me
And then she says "if I ever had breakfast in bed"
Then I say "I'd rather have breakfast in Brazil instead"
Then she says "Stop playing, why you're messing with my head?"
Then I say "I'm not playing, I got a jet and we can check it"

Yes I had you try find an energizer battery
Keep gone, she know she'll be sweating, loosing calories
You can be the best "B" I bet you couldn't handle me
With money on the bed and I can prove it on my salary

[Hook - Frankie J, Mannie Fresh:]
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a coke bottle

On the block, where we be keepin' it hot
You know the spot
Where the parkin' lot is smokin' up
Man, summer's on we

Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
Its not that I want you not to say
But if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me, yeah
Cause I'd already know

(Verse 2)
What would you do (what would you do)
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I Love You

(just saying I love you, saying I love you)
More than words
(just saying I love you, saying I love you)

(Verse 3)
Now that I've tried to (now that I've tried to)
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is
Close your eyes and just reach out your hand
And touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words
Is all you ever needed me to show
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me, yeah
Cause I'd already know

(just saying I love you, saying I love you)
More than words
(repeat till fade)(Check check ...this happened for real ...Baby Bash..ya.. Frankie J.... obsession)

Well it's early in the morning
And my heart is feelin' lonely
Just thinkin' about you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin turnin' in my bed
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin about your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feeling hopeless in my heart
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin)
What am I doin wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (it's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart

Now I know you're not my lady
But I'm tryin' to make this right
I don't know what to do
I'm going out of my mind
So baby if you let me
Kick it with you then we'll maybe
We could ride together
We could do this all night
Now I don't care if you've got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin about your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feelin' hopeless at home
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feelin' (then what am I feelin)
What am I doin wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)

** Amor **I got a call late last night from a number I didn't know
It was so strange I knew who it was from the moment she said hello
And I paused for a minute
I couldn't believe it
I kept my cool so my girl just wouldn't see She said, "I'm sorry but there's something you should know"
This is what she said to me

"I didn't let you go
No I can't let you go"
She said, "I'm having such a hard time"
Then I heard, "I didn't let you go
I just can't let you go"
And then she said, "I think I'm loosing my mind

"Cause I still love you
This I must confess
I guess I still need you
I feel I have to tell you this again
Yes I still want you
Oh these words I did not plan
So if I've interupted anything
I promise I won't call you again"

So I told her my heart felt
The same that it did before (as it did before)
Its never changed
My feelings never went away girl (no)
My heart never closed the door (no, no it never closed the door)
Then I stopped for a minute gotta think about my lady
And what we have going on (what we have going on)
She's about to have my baby
Girl, you waited much to long

I gotta let you go
I'm haning up the phone
This conversation can't go on no more
I gotta let you go
Cause if I don't let you go
I fear that I met let you know

Cause I still love you
This I must confess
I guess I still need you
I feel I have to tell you this again
Yes I still want you
Oh these words I did not plan
So if I interupted anything
I promise I won't call you again

Now I'm doing just fine with my girl
Not about to let her go (can't let her go, let her go)
Just because you find me once again it doesn't mean you're coming back home (doesn't mean youre coming back home) Now its been about 2 years or so (its been about 2 years)
Since we went our separate ways (went our separate ways)
You gotta face the fact we're over with and done
Cause I

Cause I still love you
This I must confess, Baby
I guess I still need you
I feel I have to tell you this again, Baby
Yes I still want you
Oh these words I did not plan
So if I interupted anything
I promise I won't call you again

Cause I still love you (cause I still l, I still love you Baby)
Yes I still need you (but I better not talk about it cuz I rather move on with my life and do what I gotta do)

That ain't nothing you can say to a savable playa
Cause doowop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right she's full grown settin the wrong tone
Im diggin the energy and im lovin the o-zone
So fly like a dove so fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood then im a natural dude
And we some natural fools blowin out by the pool
She like my sexy-coo mama with blades on her berata
Rockin Dolce' Gubbana(sp?) with high-drows and a igwana
[Frankie J.]
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?

[Bridge]
You know its leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Gurl you keep it so fly with you sweet hunnybuns
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes
You know its leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Gurl you keep it so fly with you sweet hunnybuns
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes(fa real though)
[Frankie J.]
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
So high like I'm a star
Feelin so high like I'm a star
Feelin so high like I'm a star
Feelin so high like I'm a star
Azucar[Omar Cruz]
Whoo!
Yeah
It's ya boy
O. Cruz
This goin' out to all those muh'fuckers that down with me from day one, man
We're here now
Let's ride out

[Verse 1: Omar Cruz]
It was all a dream
My fantasy, for a young Latin kid
Actin' like I was rappin' in front of thousands, I laugh at it now
But back then, the struggle really had a grip on me
And all my family could really do was wish the best of me (Whoo!)
We had it hard, growin' up in the barrio
When muh'fuckers would ride out and bury you with the saw
When they sense street light, I wrote my first song
Every single night in bed, I'm hearin' shots go off {*two gunshots*}
But through the pain and sorrow, and all the cloudy days
I would find a way to make sunrays brighten up my day
Ignorin' all the bassheads and the one time
That's out to make us pure California sunshine
Even the homies that know me, they know I said it, "Solely
Only for all my soldados," mamis is showin' they chonies (Ha ha)
Cause now we made it, we struggled to make it right
We hustle just to survive, we celebratin' this life (Come on)

Chorus:
[Frankie J.]     Can't stop
Ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop
Ain't no toppin' this
Candy drop
Six-four's hop to this
Now
[Omar Cruz]      Where we takin' this, man?
[Julian Bunneta] "To the top"
[Frankie J.]     Can't stop
Ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop
Worked too hard for this
Shit to pop
Ain't no stoppin' us
Now
[Julian Bunneta] "To the top"

(Verse 2)
[Omar Cruz] So now, we mobbin' to the liquor store, for supply
Same spot, where the homie took his last breath of la di
So many funerals and rosaries, lonely nights
That's why the night, we smoke on somethin', toastin' (???) life
So many rollin' with us, always ridin' so deep
Range Rove, chrome feet, six-four, gold D's
The homies hold heat daily on the boulevard
There's hood insurance so we don't catch any bullet scars
So little mama, get your pretty ass in the back
Call ya homegirls, tell 'em, "We gon' be there in a half"
Top down, you know my shit got the best sound
The convoy in candy paint, headed west bound
Smoke in the air, got the Cali weed, everywhere
Blowin' in the wind, throwin' dubs up, we don't stop
Pull at a stop
Little mama, wanna roll, let's go
[Female]    Where we going?
[Omar Cruz] Westward, ho (Come on)

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
We hit the coast, dip in three wheel motion
The sun is gettin' close to the ocean, sippin' the potion
We posted, homie, I'm feelin' right
For all the hard times
Everybody feelin' right
We had to get it tight
So now, we pourin' tequila, some drinking grey goose
Homies poundin' 12-packs, others sippin' gin and juice
Light up the don fire, player lit a O. Cruz
Pour a little liquor for the homies cause we miss you
Yeah

Repeat Chorus Twice[Intro: Omar Cruz]
Whoo!
Yeah
It's ya boy
O. Cruz
This goin' out to all those muh'fuckers that down with me from day one, man
We're here now
Let's ride out

[Verse 1: Omar Cruz]

[Hook: Frankie J.]
Can't stop, ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop, ain't no toppin' this
Candy drop, six-four's hop to this now
(Where we taking this man?) To the top
Can't stop, ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop, worked too hard for this shit to pop
Ain't no stoppin' us now
(Let's go) To the top

[Verse 2: Snowhite Tha Product]
I do solemnly swear, that you will see this latina on top
Cause even though its been a while it takes way more to ever stop a message like mine, a presence like mine
I promise youll turn on your tv and be pleasantly surprised
Its meant for me to rise, i bet you see me fight
Through the struggles you see me going through but imma get mine
That little Mexicana, la que antes hera rara
Ya crecio y ahora cieren la boca y limpiense la baba
Porque desde chicita, sabia que era muy viva
Sabia que habia razon porque era tremenda y ahora mira
Im on my way up and theres just no stopping us
I got the talent and drive  now i just need the luck
And i just need the bucks to get a real collab with Omar
Or finally get a hold of someone who wants me to co-star
I know imma get there but im so anxious i can't take it
But out of all these Mexicans, well someone's gotta make it

[Hook: Frankie J.]
Can't stop, ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop, ain't no toppin' this
Candy drop, six-four's hop to this now
(Where we taking this man?) To the top
Can't stop, ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop, worked too hard for this shit to pop
Ain't no stoppin' us now
(Let's go) To the top
