[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah, Golf Wang[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a [?], wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: Retch]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', it still got me goin'
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own shit and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Bryan
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm draggin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'?
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trainers cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds, [?] all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine [?] and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
[?] niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was [?]
You nervous like I thought you seen [?]
Got everybody thanking me
[?]
I'm a boss [?]
[?]
[?]
Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
[?]
Riding shotty in the chevy [?] know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk [?] like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado] x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to [?]
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meech]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
To get their shot, [?]
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real west side nigga, [?]
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
[?] put me high [?]
You can do that, flyin', fuck, do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on [?]
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga then drip of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the work she see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
[?] chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx [?] on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make shine sit on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell
Now I been rich since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your diction is lack, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo in another color
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My ? say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian [?]
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: SL Jones]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like [?] we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a [?]
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social [?]
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
And [?] sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
[?] what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em
Never write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the [?]
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
[?] with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on [?] tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz] x2

Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
[?] I got it right here, I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
[?] we gettin' it
With that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a [?] to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off [?]
Rottweiler just to watch 'em
Maybachs for the profit
Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing
[?] the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne
And a 3 page spread
Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, go for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
[?] a monk, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be into me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A black claimed king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare try the Elohim of flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up trick
Put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9

East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like [?]
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my [?]
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip
And just let them titties out

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some [?]
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
[?] throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blastin' naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Man didn't chief
My sons of sons'll sandwich the beef
We get loot, always scram from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this bitch, smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
[?]
Nah, fuck that
Bring them [?] back
[?]
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
[?] I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

[Verse 2: Frank]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world

[Interlude: Tyler]
Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

[Verse 5: Tyler]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, faggot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
(Here’s some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building

[Gunshots][Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than Tigger
Only blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigga, (Uhh)
Cotton-picking nigger, Golf Wang season sicker than the block
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em (Uhh)
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill and let's pretend like
I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers (Uhm)
Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck
Bitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor, (Uhh)
Pink haired Mrs, I'm her mister, sipping Slurpees, bag of chips
Now show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture (Uhh)
OF is popping like a blister, need some Listerine
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister, (Uhh)
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner out a tin flask
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner
And hopefully I get her, if I don't, fuck it then
See I never simp son, polar opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch

[Hook: Casey Veggies & Tyler, the Creator]
Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
The moon now working and the stars align
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
(Somebody told me...) I had a decline in the buzz
Not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge
And ask Bob bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum
In Bikini Bottom, I am the biggest problem
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem
Heaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthon
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem

[Mike G]
I'm like goals, those are something you have to stand to reach
My campaign speech elect me Commander in Chief
Respect to whoever's minor appearances cause mass hysteria
But I'm still incomparable, I'm like the face of America
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold
I'm a fucking centerfold, I'm something to behold
I can kill a hundred shows, take one for the road
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
It's a dog eat dog world, don't get bit bruh
A son of a bitch I am, yup, I'm a sick pup
(I thought that you were nice) Yeah, I am, slut
I'm also half ass a racist who hates niggas – yep, I'm a mixed mutt
Preme is the top bunk, green is the pillow case
Golf is the bedsheets, (hat and my T-shirt)
TrashWang sticker on that Chima Fergolfson
I'm real with the box, and I murder with the pen
It's Bimmer Boy's boy never swerving in the Benz
I'm listening to Dead Sam demos on the ten
Can I get a medium with cheese and bacon?

[Outro]
It's Loiter Squad nigga...
Fucking Loiter Squad...

Sam's after you
Sam's after who?
You!
For what? What the fuck?
He found out that you and Salem been hanging out, he said he gonna kill you
Kill me? What the fuck you mean kill me? Slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean he gonna kill me?
I don't know, he just said he gonna kill you
Not if I get to him first[Intro]

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Gold bullet that's trapped in his temple
Was just the beginning of a deranged mental
The mind wasn't simple, the man wasn't gentle
They bust out the brain but got caught in the dimple
To bust out the dental, the tooth full of wisdom
With black on black ???, they jet in the rental
The young mane hearing the whisper of Sindel
With a gift since birth, if you answer this riddle: Who I be?
The fetus of a demon
Semen from the tip
Of the penis I'm the only thing
That you see when you're dreaming
Armageddon and aftermath
This may blog in paragraphs
Sit on a throne, full of X's and bones
Blowing smoke and I laugh
Turning sinners like you
Into my personal acid tabs
Let me put you up on game
I've been shot, burned, and stabbed, and
Still ain't deceased
I carry the mark of the beast
Now can you tell me
Who the fuck I be?
Damien, as the kid replies
Wine, red wine was the color of his eyes
Coughing a lot of blood like Piru, but he slowly dies
As his eyes close shut, in prison was his eternal life

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
And now that nigga scream like he Sindel
Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell
Running with them demons since the age of 12
Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein

[Verse 2: Lil Ugly Mane]
He thought he wanted seven digits, the thickest bitches, the top position
Tried to make a profit off the poverty he lives in
Atrocities committed on the blocks that he got kids in
And now he pops prescriptions, he's in prison to suspicions
He fucked the Devil's daughter, now he pissed away forgiveness
Only sounds he hears are shots popping in the distance
Thinking that they coming, now he haunted by these visions
He knows that there's a dark, and a light, but he don't know the difference
He used to run around bangin', man, he love the shit
And now he sit around, waitin' for his punishment
Cops on some old beef, that's why he gotta hold heat
He's stuntin' like his daddy, even pops had the gold teeth
But pops went to prison back in '03
So lil man never got to listen to a OG
Never got to tell him other options that you don't see
So lil man grew up thinking prison where he supposed to be, Ugly

[Hook: Denzel Curry]

[Verse 3: Mike G]
For the scene, see the best is never seen
They say I lack in appearances, but they lack in experience
I remain quiet like I'm in constant meditation
Only way to get in my place is expert and constant observation, nigga
Never compete, much less be winner at it
Seven days a week, I found my sinister
I control my perimeter, control isn't giving up
Every effort you attempt never amounts to enough
They talk around you, but you know you can't give in
And you part of the system, so they treat you just like them
Every action is countered, so just don't disturb my zen
Every student with honor knows you must deserve lessons, yeah
I roll with what every character should have
That's why I'm equipped with a black suit and mask, I blast
Now it's silent like when the Earth had begun
I am Genesis 1, this is God's work done[Verse 1]
Follow the leader, bad senoritas in two seater's
She loves green, that's money, Mary Jane and margaritas
The way it seems, the streets be looking at me like a teacher
They hounding me, like desperate rappers waiting for a feature
I ain't saying I don't need you, I'm saying let's keep the pace
Should be back at your place, just being patient with your feet up
They say he's so chill, how does he show no stress?
He can't see into the future, how does he know what's next?
Seeing all of these steps that he's taking
You're mistaken if they say we ain't so complex
I'm tryna be in a blue coupe, you can't pronounce the name
With a bad yellow bitch and she's singing Purple Rain, so insane

[Hook]
And people talking down on me, I don't really think they should
They said they could do it better, I don't really think they could
I ain't one for niggas wishes, but I wish a nigga would
This ain't as easy as it looks, I just make it look good

[Verse 2]
If it's politics, we're the presidents so presence serves a purpose
It's obvious that we're evidence, you're paying for a service
And I feel, you always think you're less than what you can be
What does it mean if I think I'm the one these niggas can't see?
Gang mentality, Odd Future is a family
My niggas thrash, I was always anti Plan B
Did I lose you? I know I'm much more than you're used to
Now I got these girls stepping out from their usual
So they tune in, T.I., see I, realize I'm a stand up guy
And these niggas realize they can't stand to see me on TV
So they lose their footing like they were gluttons with diabetes
But fuck the bullshit, I'm just tryna get rich
With my middle fingers up screaming swag me out bitch
Black kid on the corner selling drugs, go figure
Salute them with 21 guns, I'm killing these niggas

Uhh, bitch
Oh, and Free Earl mothafucka

[Hook][Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat, pro-abortion anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Where the black girls get their weaves back
Awesome I achieve that mini, blasting "You're a jerk"
In some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot
Bouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead
I like my girls smart, skinny
Kinda pop tart, when I bite into them red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem
With the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent
Blind fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed
That I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring
I'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew
Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you
Kill the jungle let the cats loose
You didn't see me here if someone ask you

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I want to feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer, in the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try and relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa

[Verse 3: brandUn Deshay]
I'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables
I'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals
Let's take them high like the decibels
So we get them high, get them high like cholesterol
In a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber
That's fat, who needs another producer?
Chica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo
Cause I ain't really care what the rest say
Type of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape
Best stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes
Best believe I'm leaving with more of those
And I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying until the verse end, FIN
Brandun Deshay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator
Odd Future, O.F. until, until from now until forever

[Alternate Verse 3: Mike G]
We grind, these niggas asking for some promo
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet
No less profit, fiened when we drop shit
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
It's that crack, give you something to sell
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell
And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
Everything that we call flight, living life
This is everything that we call hype
I'm everything that they call nice
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see
Top ranked, number one my son
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some
And stay focused on the women and you get less done
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one
Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high
How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they flyVerse 1:
My music can get you high like limitless elevators
If presance could sing songs I'd sound like smooth operator
I'm the King, make 'em bow down
I need more cheese than rat's playhouses
You allow your child to run around
The clock keeps ticking but I keep hitting
To do numbers like GTA I'm running midday missions
How can they contend they wish they could be and have my friends
There's somedays when we ain't getting in till 1pm
Lames must be invisible I don't see them
Ironically, we're as invincible as any legend
And my lesson in them was idolize no other men
Because you're only a hero if there's a win in the end
Starting journeys, of course the hardest step is to begin
I left the bottom where it's at,never plan to meet again

Hook:
For those times when you knew everything but what to do
But now look at you,you still made it through
It seems like you know everywhere but where to go
You don't get younger you grow, don't hide your pride you let it show
It's all you, you can't lose
Don't nothing sound better than the truth
You get your paper then you stack it to the roof
It's all you, you can't lose

Verse 2:
Yo you're dealing with a hostile who's more than a novice
The way I see since I started I have this game in my pocket
Boy I operate off more than confidence, stomping
I'm hopping over the nonsense I'm presented with
It disturbs my conscience, inconsiderate
Don't you know I need it to live?
And all I take is time, but I've got so much to give
All it takes is a rhyme I could make a whole crowd flip
Fix your outfits I'll make you fire your stlyist
I'm wild sick, however fowl the fowlest is
Rude boy I might be banned from colleges
Holler if you about Dollars, cents, Yen, Euros
Or what ever language we could call it in
Got you feeling like it can takes a million years to win
For all my makers that made it man this cheers to them
And Kings and Queens if you're on the way I'd like to commend
If you're moving backwards I hope listening helps you ascend

Hook[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
You listenin to the future of this rap shit
Its no actin, still trappin
Never slackin, where the strap? Under my mattress
Turn him holy with this Magnum. Get ya Ma$e on
Street Fighter I just sit back and Capcom
The straps drawn
The set will rip a hole thru ya Teflon
Blue steel ill nose pistol long as back arms
Crackin bitches, just another lick to pass on
Run up in the house and clean that shit out when ya dad gone
Real nigga, from the east. You better ask about me
And think about this Glock before you jock and rap about me
Creepin down the block, the .40 cocked
He out his boundaries, murk a nigga then we outti
We don't do the county, and that's just the way it goes
Get money, fuck hoes. Cause that's all a nigga know
He was trippin, now he slippin its a go
Choppa shells around the neck, all my niggas cutthroat
Fatts

[Hook x2]
Money. Bitches
Can't forget the weed
Give me those three things
And that's all a nigga need
Countin' Gs, chasin' paper
While these bitches on they knees
Money bustin' out the seams
So she tryna join the team


[Verse 2: Mike G]
It's always been my intention to capture this attention
On that money making mission, everyone seems to envision
Now you listen, got my heart then love letters that are written
Love late nights with women draped in laces on my linen
I do it cause something's missing
You put me in this position
We might take awhile to get it cause everyone's different
From foreign girls that just like cruising in my car
To white chicks that do it for cocaine and carry on, yo
At my shows I hype it up, blowing good then light it up
Always looking for better, I can never get high enough
Sicker than your average Crenshaw graduate
Leaving stores with bags with Ts wrapped in plastic
Succeed, you'll see everything that you imagined
Believe, that's the first thing you need to make it happen
Get it good, while you got it, doesn't matter where you going
Tell my neighbors "See you later" and leave with my doors open, yeah

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I push the 8 ball right across the pool table
Not basketball but im saying my game could fool April
Its such a marvelous day and niggas still will hate you
Plant a tree water the surroundings than wait to peel a grapefruit
Success is my escape route drive it like a grey coupe
License invalid, I'm headed to my palace
I'm a cowboy bitch I'm rowdy, music playing loudly
I'm fresh in my attire you boys just in the choir
I'm rolling sober take your king out of cobra
No venom in 'em, open my hand of women
I'm about the benjaminem, fucking off as I spend it
In foreign countries comfy and fucking distant
Gold bitches wash my dick and clean the kitchen
Tatted with golf wang cats and stencils scripted where they dippin
If it ain't about a waffle then we dippin
Bitch im too wide expedition pay attention before you miss it nigga listen

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I got your back like a spinal tap
Yoga mats runnin out of bubbles soda flat
Nigga hulk attack green snaps from dojer raps
My wolves lurk where logan at
Wolf gang musical chairs I fuckin fold you back
Rollin up weed and im dabbin the wax
You stick to the script ho I get to the facts
Rippin through tracks like a train conducter
I'm giving them tasks, I'm the instructor
Roofs on fire like DJ Khaled tour bus
Smokin on weed bitch I'm high as a kite
Breakin down more finna hop on this flight
Born a real nigga real nigga for life
Don't believe in the hype baby this mellowhype
Smoke good for the night so I'm good for the night
I'm taking it back to the house going to the hood for the night
Bats on heels nigga straps gon' kill
The cab no wheels jack told Jill
I don't like kinds and icons who pipe dimes and so on
Let by gones be by gones and tai quan do on

[Verse 3: Mike G]
Where I stand still fucking awesome I am
Need chains with more rocks then rocks and sand in iran
I saute the chef and if its Odd you want to test
It will be one big room full of triple 6 reppers
Always say that I'm lo key with my moves
Cause I'm a ninja I don't like niggas to see what I do
And my focus was on saving grace
Till I got that late call that wolf killed ace
Heard he sprayed up the place
Well I'm the Midnight Marauder that makes twilight music
And fans think that I'm more awkward then Kristen Stewart
Couldn't do it without the losers that thought I wouldn't do it
No sympathy for the ones that never stuck to it
Attack em, rack em, wrap em in the back of a Buick
Wonder how my day goes it ain't nothing but music
And wonder how I spend my evenings and my kind of night would be
See my kind of night would be nylon rope duct tape
Me and Ameriie[Verse 1]
Nah King Mike G, know we stay OF till the death
Best bitches get wet off of that pineapple express
Thought I told you that that rain don't stop
They ain't taking me in unless they bring like 54 cops
Nigga fuck rules, fuck you, fuck a jail sentence
All them fucking critics say my gang is a gimmick
Make em say, "God". Pray to Odd, theres no other
If I was 21 I woulda had the Fader front cover
Know we keep it criminal, run up in your housing
Young gunna been snapin necks since two thousand
Never one for stress my nigga I just blaze
Them LA streets is death like I was trapped inside a cage
Now it's sold out shows, jumping off the stage
But never lose sight, still lookin' for better days
This is fire coming out them beats by dre
But I dont even fuck with Kush my nigga I like hazeA Million… A Million…
A Million…
A Million…A Million…
A Million… A Million…

(Verse 1: Mike G)
I’ll never say I’m the shit I’m too clean for that
But I will say I’m sick, no strings attached
That, you can promise, don’t need a ring for that
Try get my whole crew rich, so my team can match
Honestly niggas can't fly with no wings attached
So I’m in a G-5 with the screens intact
And I’m a really swell guy just to be exact
Fact is I’ve been worldwide just to take it back
My 'I canget you high' lines make em fiend like crack
So It's Coke Keys i'm dishin till my seat lean back
And the dollar bills flipping till the gold card black
Get four cars to match, I’ma leave it at that
Spit four bars for rapping we can meet in the back
I mean the top, the lord knows I don’t know how to act
I didn’t start at the base, cuz the top attracts
Still first in the race, see how they react
Whats that… ha… just to spit facts
Keep me abstract in combat
I’ve spent about (a million) bucks on the streets alone
Cuz it’s like, the hundreds is my home and I’m
At Alife everyday
Nigga Rogue Status, okay
This pad is my shield, pen’s my sword for real
Embrace the martian, turn the whole world to clover field
Negotiations when I heard ‘em say they’d give me the mill-
Open up the briefcase and shit, I’ll take that deal
No bitch denying me I’m chasing money cuz see
Red, White and green Parmesan I need extra cheese
That drip like Krink, but in cans nigga spray it
Fuck love, all I’ve got for hoes is wait, won’t say it
Tryna Stray from cliché I’m rocking my chain anyway
Bad bitch on my side, she could get it any day
Any day in anyway look theres a price to pay for jocking my move
These niggas watch me like a stage play
Peep this head, cracker, ho smacker
Whack rapper, attack her, Internet hacker
No slacker, best factor, west division bracket
Act like you know TH on the jacket
Not a DJ but I scratch it while you hack it
Make you go go like gadget, perform magic
Without a wand, I drop bombs, without Saddam
A vet without ‘nam, I make sense without common ground
(A million) Rappers wanna be like me I said, (A million) niggas tryna touch mike g
(A million) rappers all tryna prevail yeah, (A million) try but a million fail
07, west coast legend, make the game different
I don’t know why the hell these niggas say it didn’t
Versus  best written, clothes are my addiction
Nine days out the week I’m in the lab spittin’
Or in the cab pimpin’ bitches that look like you
Cuz the seats all white and the coupe’s light blue
I’m a crook like you, cats back in my city
Said they had the King beat dawg, what could I do?
Know what I’m supposed to style, I’m coolest nigga’s poster child
Bet everybody nobody know my style
It’s ironic and what not, how niggas gonna cop
An iced out g-shock just because its hot
Ask, I ain’t gotta Obama shirt to say the least
I won't carry around a President that’s not deceased
And I’m sorry but it’s true, pay me, fuck you
This verse is to guarantee that he can’t be beat
And my main goal is just to have some fun
Cuz the scoreboard don’t show you how the game was won
But west coast mothafucker, what’s fucking with them
Not a damn thing nigga, we doin’ our damn thing

A million… A million…[Produced by Midtown Pat]

[Hook: Matt Martians]
"Bitches come and go
Come And Go, Till They Find Out... (x4)"

Look, bitches come and go, like everywhere you go
Look, I ain't on no fuckery
No 'sus'ary don't fuck with me
Hoes don't get no love from me
Flyest fucking bugs we be
Swanging in my truck with ease
Hopping out with fresh white t's
She looking like she just a tease
Get that ho up on her knees
Bag her then teabag her then slide out, that's how it's supposed to be
She wishing well, I throw some change
Penny for your thoughts, bitch
I just want them drawers bitch
Tryna cut like saws, bitch
I ain't tryna play Gepetto, I don't want no strings attached
I just want to get the scoop ?
But wait, wait, fuck you reaching
All up in my pockets for?
Don't fuck with that unless you reaching
All under my boxer ho
That ho sucks, tryna slidea cool one on me, fuck that!
Act just like my pockets diseased and bitch you don't touch that
She lurkin on a mission I'm using my intuition bitches
Come and go like seasons
Grab your poles and get to fishing nigga

[Hook]

If you don't get new green, then you show no gain
If they ain't asking you for answers, Then you hold no reigns
People call me different like I got a new name
Now I'm Mike, Every time you see me got a few chains
G, For my first gold one, Versace medallions
You see me as number one, champion
This can be done, improper:
You gotta to do it right, to prove yourself to others
You probably have to do it twice
That's why I'm so self-centered, I'm not focused on you
Others are never too busy to tell you all they have to do
At this point I could never care, you say you see me everywhere
I had prior engagements be glad you joined in this affair
So you see, bitches come and go
All the time, til they find out
That I got a stash waiting patient in my hide out
Wonder, 'what makes you love me now?'
I can make your style switch
Hold on to your pride when you look me in my eyes, bitch[Verse 1: Mike G]
Peep game, I come through in every street lane
Roll my wheels more than major stoners do their favorite strain
And the one i'm with can drink until all bottles are drained
With me, she feel like she dancing on the wings of a plane
Things will never be the same, homie my whole home team are household names, and still with so much to gain
My flow is so golden, you can put it in a chain
Aim for more than a name, how you think we live the same
When you not flossin, hardly
I drink Hennessey, she on Bacardi
We don't mind starting problems as long as we start a party
Call your job, tell em to schedule a replacement
Cause these pills will get you so high, they might send you to the matrix
Let's ride, side to side as my eyes arise at Half past nine, watch me like halftime, I mastered this
So slick I could prolly smash your chick
Because of Mike, they put the G in the alphabet

[Hook: Mike G]
Find me riding in a foreign and I don't know where I'm going
And we ain't getting in til ten in the morning
If I'm on it, then she on it, if she got it, then I want it
If you looking to tomorrow, but you living for the moment
Fist pump it, hell yeah
If you bout it, show me something
Rockstar, I'ma keep it going if I see you jumping
Fist pumping, hell yeah
If you bout it, show me something
Rockstar, I'ma keep it going if I see you jumping

[Verse 2: Larry Susan]
Smoking like a rasta in a flying saucer
Mix between Jamey Jasta and Kevin Costner
Eating mushrooms on lasagna pasta, I'm a monster
Illegal funds, that's my foster, keep your posture
Or you'll scratched from the roster, drugs in school lockers
Blondes with big knockers, what's for dinner? Lobster
Smoking blunts in the outfield with Holden Caulfield
On that real kill, making money turn like a windmill
Flip the intel in the rental, back to grinding banging instrumentals
Your girlfriend says hello
She gags so well though, she ate my Larry Jell-O
Oh well, bitch don't kill my mellow, Susan

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike G]
I love living lavish
When I was young, I'd rock the hat backwards like Ash
Gotta catch all the cash
And I spent it when I had it, thought I was so fly
I forget my flight status every time someone would ask
But that's nothing new if you knew this particular individual
Situation critical, when citizens get uncivil
So stress less, especially if I'm in your concerns
I could repeat myself, they still wouldn't learn
So you may find me riding in a business whip through business districts
Around suits and business men but I don't feel like one of them
And once again, nothing without progression
You feel like screaming to the heavens every time that you win
So fist pump, hell yeah
If you bout it, show me something
For all my brothers and cousins riding down the block busting
For all my sisters, sh-shawty hope you never stop hustling
Haters can stand in the way but we ain't stopping for nothing

[Left Brain]
I feel you, My nigga[Verse 1: Mike G]
This earth told me to hold my ground
My music showed me nobody can match my sound
Mos Def said if it's something you can change around
Then keep quiet, you got nothing to complain about
Now, I told you I would hold you down
I told you that we were kings and queens uncrowned
Too hard to break down, you were too compound
Though at times you feel I wish that they could see me now
I won't feel like I made it, until my maids work grave shifts
Paint this, honest, with a flow so heinous
Dreams will land you further than any promise could take us
And everything now is documentation
Just wait, you'll see gain when the pace gets made
Nothing's rewarded for loitering but patience gets paid
They'll tell you that time is money, and that's fact
If you're lucky you'll get more minutes but not the same ones back

[Bridge: Mike G] (x2)
So hold the 99 problems cause I'd rather have none
Never know who might come
And you'll need new shoes when the blues get sung
And some for when you run
Cause you should be right behind if not already number 1, uh

[Verse 2: Mike G]
They're a star, you're a sun, just bigger but by far
Without you everyone's world would stay dark
There's no need to listen to the others when they talk
You're brighter than they are, you're needed when days start
You ask how you reach the top when they don't give you a shot
But you have no reason to stop to say a failure's what I'm not
And people around me, they say that I'm crazy
But I do what I gotta do to get to where I wanna be
Cause you're just like me, I know you know what you're worth
And you can't brag about the things that you don't deserve
It's a cold world, you must know the correct way to spell it
And people will use things according to how you sell it
You're expected to know no one will warn you
If you're not willing to do something, no one should do it for you
Pay attention closely, it's not difficult to see
I'm way ahead of everything, leave everything up to me[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I constantly get the feeling that Satan's watching me
Nice stroll on a quest for a soul, probably
But luckily I gave him mines a long time ago
Fuck you expect when a child's momma and father gone
But truthfully I got no life, a lifeline my brain's dead
Strobe lights gleam as I dance with the devil
Ski mask and a shovel. Grim Reaper, dig deeper
Into my mind trying to figure where I'm coming from
Hell's basement. My bloodshed on gray pavement
Trying to meet death, I guess, but shit I hate waiting
Not only do I hate God, but I hate Satan
Such a hater, I despise how I hate hatred
It's kinda dumb, I see, but school was never fun for me
So I brought a gun with me, got tired of them fucking with me
So if Christ got a problem, he can come and get me
And I got a sword for his side if he think he's slick
To tell the truth I blame him for the mood switches
Guns for your gods, and a noose for the cute bitches
I see you looking at me. A smile is more disgusting
You wanting to fuck, but still it makes me happy
Because what else I got...?

[Bridge: Mike G]
Everything that you deserve
My logic to fill my pockets
Build a billion off of words
The fame is secondary
Because Washington was first
I came, saw, and conquered
Gave you all that I was worth
Ugh, yea
What more could you ask for?
They gave up on me
I wish you would have told me that before
I gave you everything
What more could you ask for?
Except for all the worlds gold
This is my Award Tour

[Hook: Vince Staples]
Because what else I got...?
A nine millimeter, tech-nine loaded to the top
Got a couple plots in my head, I should give a shot
Hopefully they make me rich, normality was never an option
Cus I hate this shit. I want the money, cars, clothes, and the girls
Til I get a sense that, I don't belong in the world
So I fill a clip up, and I point the shit straight at my dome
Fuck Heaven, I just want to go home

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Time is only you waiting for the past
Put your hand in and what you get out of it is what you grab
No lax, equals racks with no breaks or hiatus
Give dick to bitches, middle fingers to the haters
And now they get excited just to say that you seen us
Get paid and get mids, just because the convenience
Because I got us up, but I'll never have enough
White sluts to fuck, she told me to bring cuffs
If lawyers get laid off, then we can't sue
But it's known he sell his soul for a GT-2
That's death, head-shots they infrared beams
It's why we roll with K's in the van like the A-Team
Don't stop, go forth. Proceed
Stay high, you can find me in the nose-bleeds
And they know we don't play for no prize
We make moves, you stay stiff like MRI's
You see? That's what you get

[Bridge 2: Mike G]
Everything that you deserve
My logic to fill my pockets
Build a billion off of words
The fame is secondary
Because Washington was first
I came, saw, and conquered
Gave you all that I was worth
Ugh, yea
What more could you ask for?
69, 187 on the girl next door
I want nothing, but everything
That's what I do it for
That and all the worlds gold
This is my Award Tour

[Hook 2: Vince Staples]
Because what else I got, besides a pocket full of nothing-ness
Scraping up a dollar for the bus that I just fucking missed
I wanna be the best, just put me in the discussion
Quit acting like I'm not the best thing that you ever heard
I'm in it for the Awards for lack of better words
King size cupboard and whores i’m about to put to work
Same ones from my childhood that I used to lurk
Now it's all good, because they see I'm fucking iced out(Verse 1: MIKEG)
Heard koolade bishop's coming for his mac soon
I'm a have to cut the body up and stash it in a black track suit
And wrap that in plastic, so the maggots don't attack it
I'm laughing, 3 days later at your open casket
I'm sick, Shoved it in your mom's bum
And made her shit to a backflip
Chatted all your crack attacks, thesis
Heard you like to smoke your own peices
Believe it, MikeG bitch aka the black Jesus
Put sister on her knees and make her snort penis
Left your nieces in pieces wish you could have seen it
Bitch

LACPSBFD, Fuck Koolade!

(Verse 2: Yungjay)
And we ain't talkin bout the drink, nigga

There'll be two hits in this fight okay kid
Me hitting you and you hitting the pavement
Your breath you need to save it
Because I smell the bullshit fragrance
Ever since gay marriage, I haven't beat a fag since
Punching holes in walls just to kick you in the balls
And head buttin sluts and uppercut them in their fucking jaw
Piss me off, Will get you pissed on
Pussy I`ll have you sprayed like the cat named tron
T minus raw, fuck the Midas touch
The grim reapers hand but I don`t masturbate much
But uhh... I fuck your favorite bitch leaving cuts
Cuz I`m... soo sharp when I bust a nut it`s enough to fill up a magic school bus
And hot enough to make your favorite rapper move to cuba
Call of duty must of taught you your weaponry
Look up dragons skin when stepping to me
Picked an unnecessary beef with the boy on the block
It`s all fun and games till one of our firearms get locked!

(Verse 3: MIKEG and Yungjay)

I gotcha waka flocka, hit this bitch wit the forth and the sixth in
Cut his dreads off an he`s looking like dixon
Antwuan, time to change this bitches tampon
Now his nose is all bloody from the muddy
Brothers slash half blood buddies, (Yungjay: Yung Fuckin Jay)
I got this I was only six, when I hit em for his onyx
Light assassins had to penetrate
I don`t blame you, It`s fate that your fucking fake
(Yungjay)
Fuck koolade, this bitch is a grenade
Shit gets me heated faster than a micro-wave
In the center of a rave, In the middle of summer while he`s workin like a slave
Had a crush with a slut who had fuckin aids
He would still penetrate, Fruits of my labour? Suck on my grapes
Fight me when your in shape, soap won't clean the slate
Invest in proctology cuz your ass you need to save[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I rock a black tee, I step in black shoes
My denim jeans black and my fitted is too
I date a white girl soundin' black on the phone
I'll whip a 750 if it's black on chrome
I need a black card cause I'm a black shopper
Clean out the stores like somebody robbed ya
Glad trash bags, throw them in the black bags
The black bags with the gold writin' on the black tag
The Jager in my cup is licorice black
Soon as I turn the bottle more liquor spillin' back
I'm rich, I'm wealthy, I'm drunk and I'm black
I'm dope, I'm coke, I'm weed, I'm crack
I'll get you hooked like you relapsed
It's Blacc Friday and I'm glad to be black
It's Blacc Friday and I'm glad to be black

[Hook]
What do we do on Blacc Friday?
Chill with my crew on Blacc Friday
Get in the mood on Blacc Friday
You know what? Nigga, it's Blacc Friday
What do we do on Blacc Friday?
Chill with my crew on Blacc Friday
Get in the mood on Blacc Friday
Cause it's Friday, it's Blacc Friday

[Verse 2: Tyler]
White bitches, white girls, white drugs
Black girls don't do it but my type does
Fuck it in my white van, beat her with a nice white nightstand
Until I give her gashes where it's nothin' but the white meat
E-T-I-H, W's, double D's on her knees
White gargle yellow fuckin' bumblebees
Use whitey's as my dinner course for intercourse
So much fuckin' white make Darth Vader have a thinner force
But of course, I'm the white boy that shows no remorse
Pull up on a stark with enough white to kill a horse
Nigga Friday, fuck a Blacc Friday, umm
Wolf Gang make a white pregnant bitch wan' abort
Bring the remainin' red and white pieces to the fort
Odd Future, there wolves bang where a couple bears hang
With a white box logo with a couple stains
From a black creampie in a whitey, make it light gray

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike G]
Gravis black box, gray Hundreds sox
Everythin' new, so my whole team rock like Metallica
Gun metal twenty-ten Challenger
Shit stress free I ain't even gon' hassle her
I just play my part make moves like chess
Ask your bitch who the best, question mark like Guess?
Make a mess outta tracks, got my hat back
Shades dark as fuck so all I see is black
Bet that, look I'm a Hot Topic nigga
My attire dark lookin' like a Gothic nigga
Spit shit take off like a rocket, nigga
Got the whole West coast in my pocket nigga
Pitch the rock, Mike Vick, swag so sick
Ask 'bout me bitch, dressed like an eclipse
Tell the truth, this shit wouldn't be fun without me
Bitch I'm drawing Black Lines ask the Hundreds about me

[Hook][Hook: Mike G]
Tell me all of your true feelings
And what you wanna do with us
My crew made of true villains
If we shoot you should shoot with us
If you do that's my nigga
I got love for the real bitches
That there is the isn't it
Well thats what you consider

[Verse 1: Mike G]
[?], know i flow perfect
With out a purpose life must be worthless
And in any instance im with it forgive or forget
Tickets for a sentence they might end up missing
Im hurting
Those with no focus your mind must be open
Thats what i need most of them
Though others [?] follow
The voice of a generation [?]
Due to my level of elevation high
Hitman should be my new occupation
[?]
Nothing is gained if you never take risks
I plan to progress till we don't exist
I need you to listen, i dont need assistance
Just walk with a vision pursue a position
So what you go, let em know
Im the man now, stand down
Cause this might be your final chance last stance
[?] lap when i pass
Wave that checkered flag in a circle with my superman stance
Its a mean to an ends [?]
Then its sink or swim if you dont float
[?]
Loose leaf before i loose steam

[hook]

[Verse 2: Pouya]
Keep it calm and collect
She offered the neck
All for the set
Ok whats next
You rappers be acting suspect
Line em up, only mess with a few
Im riding around with my crew
And my driver is screw
You sit on a couch while im busing a move
Tell me im keeping the flow and she want to keep goin'
I feed the few
This how i do (this how i do)
You get goosebumps when i touch you
Baby bone 94
Do the math slowpoke
Fast stroke tip toe
Only 5 foot 4
With a 6 foot ho
8 foot stripper pole
Divided the dimes
Together they grind
Killing each other for money and diamonds
I really can't blame em
Get money for the kids when the day comes
Respect me the feelings is mutual
Been doing some things i really ain't used to
This lifestyle i gotta get used to it
Pussy bald like bruce willis

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
My girl shoot once but she never shoot twice
Shine like a dime nickel play that right
Ima keep it g try and play it like mike
Try and pull yo ho and fuck her on skype
Knock the pussy out thend send ya on sight
New slaves to the game to god which is I
E Y E, what do you see?
S T E V I to the E
So you wonder why this nigga so hot?
Cooking with the ice then you got me in a pot
That percy jackson, water whipping
Tossed sideways and the boat be tipping
Denzel ain't snitching
So brother keep listening
Me and shooter [and a baller that's a pistol and piston]
Never go rogue so i dont be lynching
Yellow gold in my teeth nicknamed bart simpson
Melissa its a real life [lisa]
[? bicycle jump[?] visa
Play for teh win we the highest you see us
Ask freddy kreuger because he dreamed us
C 9 O F S S
Why your girl think I got an S on my chest
Try and get saved i ain't loaded
Pull the trigger on the truth [?][Produced by Midtown Pat]

[Verse 1: Mike G]
I ran the streets like when I used to loop up beats
I’m all models and singers asking me when we’re gonna meet
I’m so unique, just see that you can’t see me
Break rules, believe and see
That I’m you times three
And me?
Well there’s no other, like me on the earth
From what I seen and heard I can captivate with words
This is more than rap
Each breath says, "nigger, what you got on that?"
Every step is a fact, every minute I put in it
It improves every sentence
Your reign ends with this period there is no point
In my spare time I roll up joints
Pin things together well boss, get joint in, check this
I’m looking for the future, going to the moon
Looking for new one to make her want to join me to my room
Don’t mean to boast but damned if I don't brag
Bitch, try to keep up and maybe we can last
Nigger better speak up, you hide behind a mask
It's no debate that hate'll get you nowhere fast
But you run it in quicker than a hundred yard dash
Drivin' with your eyes closed foot on the gas, yo
What’s the difference between me and you?
You feel you shining like the sun, I’m what the world wakes up to
When it’s dark I illuminate entire rooms
I’m so in tune yo, that at night I glow
Got myself like I've taken these steps before
You are now fucking with a professional[Verse 1: Mike G]
I'm still a hazardous spitta, I figure I'd rap to get richer
But after that I remembered, most artist ain't painting pictures
So when I started I knew that they would thank me like November
Don't need a number one spot against you ranking contenders
And people say a lot of things but they never say what's real
How the fuck you talking about MC's on my heels
When they ain't got the same speed, we don't do the same things
Don't understand my words niggas like they can't read
Heard you're intimdated by people you can't be
And there's no coming to my level if your nose might bleed
So I got my shoes on, ain't no going slow
Shoot the other runners before they even say go, fuck 'em
Odd Future

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Ayo, I'm classic like '96 posted on the corner
No chain on, shoot up them niggas because I wanna
Fuck it, you'll see, don't bring your kids around me
Worse than that 24th fucking letter times three
You're a lame, I'm saying I ain't even in your range
Six banks one day, hit the block then change
That’s pretty much my only scheme to get rich
Cops come, answer the door like “i ain't did shit"
Fuck em all Mindstate kill em all attitude
Body didn’t fit in the case like that'll do
There ya go
Make your heart beat at a faster pace
Go to shows looking for rappers to lacerate
You hear hollering and you just heard doom
Tell em dont fear me, fear the fuckin full moon
Collect body parts and try to reattach at the seams
Like get em boys
Get the wolves on your own team
Fuck em

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Niggas don’t know what to mother fuckin' do
When that bullet hits your mother fuckin' head, bitch
We be on the block
Servin' rocks
Shootin Glocks
With the mother fuckin' neighborhood gang, ho

[Verse 4: Mike G]
Hey I’m Mike G bet they know my name on your block
It’s funny I come around to watch everything stop
Nigga, red lights
Red dots
Pointed at ya headlights
Figure these niggas left cause their shit wasn’t dead right
OF Wolfgang, Number 1 asshole
Too many fuckin' bodies to worry about a death toll
All I know is Taco’s filming porno in the hotel
Earl fucking got away, Hodgy’s fuckin' duckin' jail
Vince is stashing murder weapons under the bottom bunk
And Tyler’s riding around with a bitch in his trunk
Speakers loud and distorted
Stickin' forks into outlets
Didn’t drop the body
Cause he left without the address
Had to call him up, ask why he wasn’t there yet
Said he swagged it out, so he didn’t use the MapQuest
Said he’d be surprised if he survived the night
Tell him dump the body in the first place you think is right
Like, they be on some raped sluts
I be on caked up
Raise cups to the fact that you ain’t wakin up
Take it how you want it, mother fucker get stuck
Bottom line is they are them
We are us
Fuck em[Hook - Vince Staples]
I spit with the passion of christ who abandoned me
Life's a game of love and war, everyones a casualty
I casually, kill them all
Tell me why you mad at me
You lucky that I let you breathe
But on the trill, im just triple beam, scheming
Double murder dreaming
Aim a eagle at any nigga giving me a reason
Im a demon, rollin with a legion
Colder than the bitches decomposing in the freezer

[Verse 1 - Mike]
Cooking up crack as if music is my kitchen
I became godzilla with the poorest disposition
I went through this shit believing that everything was written
I was wrong because that would make this entire world fiction
Thats false your info is inaccurate
I’d die for this like Martyrs but a little more passionate
Cause if it came down to it I kill for it
Coal still fine
Want them triple six to greasers
Separation
Bodys didn't disappear
We threw them in the lake and
Moved them to the next name on my list of niggas waitin
Which would leave the widows with heart aches and
Then we move to the list of bitches bein patient
Uhh , I kill em by the 8th and
Get paid in pounds
So now im sellin weight and
Now theres fans waitin
Just for a chance to see him
Worldwide they sayin that they need him
Fuck a hometown hero I'm a legion in my region

[Hook - Vince Staples]

[Verse 2 - Mike G]
I was so sick, knew that she couldn't resist it
With words so slick, I pass a Limitless Resistance
Im suggesting you should pay for this
When i'd rather write no need for honorable mention
Ask who I work with they ask "Who do you like?"
Well I don't look up to no other niggas but MellowHype
And like, Vince and Ace and shit, and Earl and Frank and then
There's Matt Martians, Syd of course Earl again and Domo Gen
Don't know who else to trust, you know my luck switch
So who I fuck with, niggas I came up with
Raised with respect I must've lost it along the way
I hope don't see the shit I say to chicks like every fucking day
Tell a bitch to pick up a book and read between the lines
I watch 'em close, but these bitches ain't as precious as my time
I want money for generations, only then will I be fine
After I cop a white Porsche, and name it Cloud 9

[Hook - Vince Staples][Produced by Midtown Pat]

[Mike G]
Our life's a passionate pursuit I know she better be worth it
I don't keep too many cus I don't feel like they deserve it
There you have it, I'm savage Excuse me where are my manners?
Yo she fine, look like designs from the mind of Ruth Handler
I love you when you don't speak, you're so far beyond my reach
They don't even compete, you need to get 'em out they seats
Since (your) attire acquired for every occasions amazin'
Applause isn't enough you deserve standin' ovations
With hopes that dips through traffic or makes you go ecstatic no
Need to hold you back, if you want it you should grab it
I got what you need. If you say others can't have it
We'll remain this close if you don't get too dramatic
Say what you may, your infatuation will get you through the day
But it's conflicting if they don't appreciate what you say
But you're so very indecisive even if there's only one way
I'm hopin' I get her someday as she's walkin' down the runway
I'm guessin' it was the way you were steppin'
It was the cause and effect I gained a slight obsession
Don't think its rare at all
Cus you were built to perfection after all
So what less could you expect?
You can blame how you were born, You're so far beyond the norm - al
All I really want is you in your purest form
The most beautiful rose might even have the most thorns
But I'm guessin' her ex men couldn't whether the storm
Too often you're with women hoping they might consent
For what it's worth you could've turned it into time well spent
But I'll never judge another without full knowledge of the situation
In this race I place in Porsche design briefcases
What she's laced in is perfect for this present situation
If they're worth it I send them in like expensive rebates
The lights flash more but never cover your face
The way they talk has got to be a favorite accusation
'Til you start to regret it every minute you're in it
Since you feel like it something like it could've been prevented
With one missed connection or if you said the wrong sentence
To the right person you still could be workin' for them
But 9 to 5 wasn't your first choice
Now they admire you it's like your presence is your only voice
So could you live without it?
Remember when you were doubted
The quietest person's persistence in this sense can speak the loudest
And I know how it feels, they think you're something you're not
But somethings missing in them. You give it all that you got
You feel what more could I do? Maybe they don't understand
Ignorance is bliss, so happiness can go hand in hand
That's how I feel we should be, you see I know what you need
International. This a different type of air that we breathe
I told you I wouldn't leave I never said you could stay
Only path to choose is forward I can show you the way
But it'll never be easy, but I think you're a ten
So way I see it the system is designed for us to win
So points goes to those who rhyme, Whose minds are ahead of their time
And we only chase women who drink fine wine
But it doesn't really matter, we don't take them out to dine
But we stuff joints I put more in mine
Man we supposed to shine
As we cross the borderline, clock stikes 2:59Dreams of Chanel, Robyn, and Christine
Feel like anything I achieve would be more than I receive
They don't teach the fabric of life, how you fold at the seams
Hustle to get everything by any and all means
Energy only exists if enthusiasm's fed
They love you the most when they can use you to get ahead
Who am I to preach lessons? Now they second guess 'em
When they see who spits the best they shouldn't question my profession
Teach you I'm the professor
Don't question the method is what
Earl said to me when I dropped Mike Check
And that made me a soldier
So I'm stepping till my death In California's hottest desert
Bape camo on my weapon
Fuck ammo; I spit bullets and bars that nobody can handle
Anything you heard before this was a sample
And I reload quicker than the others
With songs, verses, and covers so I do this in my slumber
We are a bunch of others, Wolf Gang hunters
Don't take from us cuz we find niggas like four brothers
I figured I would be what the game was missing
Went from call of duty missions to the center of attention
The others took their careers and ran them to the ground
So doubters should always be the first people you let down
Think it's easy, might be with advice but naw
Mike G site me as philosopher, Or Moracular
Trynna get my pockets full, remind me of Carrie how we laugh at ya'll
It's me and my team back says my name
Bitches running full court if the like to play games
Appreciate my patience, eyes where I'm aiming
Love notes to redheads thank you letters to Damien
I remember conversations like what if we don't make it?
Now we travel to different countries feeling greater than the lakes
It doesn't matter what they rate us and strive off hate
I learned to love it, seems like I get so much of it
Any time spent waiting is time spent wasted
Giving in is complicated I hardly understand basic
A sinners mind is a sanctum, I'm essential to your mental
Gun to the game's temple, then I drove it like a rental
Why do I never complain about how they never mention me
When I spit degrees over any simplistic symphony
More complex than architects with any amount of layers
Life's a video game I'm controlled by the best player
Thats why it's fuck the rest unless they treat us with respect
All black with blank checks I am racer x
Not the one to lose, failure is always an option just never the one I choose
Friends will watch you go down easier than the bitches you kiss...
That's why I say fuck it life's lame and there's no moment's more important than the ones you miss
I hope this makes any sense…
Nah, I hope you listen to thisMike G, yo
Uh, Midtown..

[Verse 1]
Catch me in foreign countries, I'm taking pictures in the lobby
You can't copy how I floss, I mix OF & Versace
How many people you know, flex interviews with Vogue?
Fresh, from my head, high down to the floor, oh
No pain from drinking champagne
Come and ride with me, I can make your life change
I say no names, play no games
And if you don't, then we're one in the same
See, you can never go full speed til you're in your own lane
I come to any event, draped in gold chains
I do it because I'm young and have everything to gain
Staying true to every single letter in my name
Things will never be the same
I find myself pushing hard all my pedals in the rain
I'm so vain, but I don't care
They should announce my name before I walk down stairs

[Hook]
And her skin color tells you she's the perfect mix
And I'm so classic, I think I'm stuck in '96
I'm so fly, I can make it to heaven from hell
And I make  a mess of things, but I clean up well
They say my style is advanced
That's cause I shop in England and France
And you can do what ever people will say that you can't
But luck will get you no where if you don't take a chance

[Verse 2]
See I'm so futuristic, my military enlisted me
With high roles of significance as leader in logistics
Women love it when you're consistent
And no other chick is mentioned. That's how I get 'em
Persistence, stay in their mouths more than dentist
Music changes when you learn, there's so much more to a song
It takes long to heal a burn, it's so easy to do wrong
It's on, and only stops if you accept defeat
Made a mission, finish things strong, finish complete
Life to me is more than of name shoes on your feet
If you don't know my name, then you should know I run with elites
I ran the streets back when I used to loop up beats
I'm on models and singers asking me when we're gonna meet
I'm so unique, see that you can't see me
Break rules, believe and see I'm a few times three
And me, well there's no other like me on the earth
And what I've seen and heard, I can captivate with words

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey gorgeous, I can love you like I love Porches
Could paint pictures but it's hard to capture perfect in portraits
If you with it, we can go wherever the world calls us
Tonight everything you see in me can be all yours
They used to take my words, twist em, and run
But you can take me every morning as you rise up the sun, uh-huh
I take it affectionate fun
I'm not a dog, I'm a wolf and a lion in one
As I cannot be contained, just let me explore
And I have seen many lands but none like yours
You won't have to tell me which way to go
Guide myself like I've these steps before
Cubans with red lipstick be my Christine
We kill em all and drive away clean from murder scenes
If you're French, you could be like Chloe to me
And I hold on to you like you hold onto bags from Celine, see
She's my main thing when I'm where she stay
She's my out of town girl when she's in LA
Together we shine bright, we equate to sun rays
Know that talk is cheap but that's the price you pay
They say my style is advanced
That's cause I shop in England and France
And you can do whatever people say you can't
But luck will get you nowhere if you don't take a chance[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
It's the pick of the litter
Mobbin' deep in the woods with six other niggers
Yellin' at the trees like hey, hi mister
I'm Life Litter's official stripe getter
Dig this, I'll get a shovel and strike sisters
And kick them when the handle starts diggin' in my blisters
Sick, cynical, cyanide spitter
So when I kick rhymes, my victims die quicker
I'm broke, no cheese, my ho's cracker
Snort third verse of Pigions, I'll show you a dope rapper
I'll shit on a nigga with no bladder
Then throw it in his eyes to show him he don't matter
The night creeper in a nice white Jeep
Here with three white divas who snort and like penis
I'm hotter than at least five heaters
In the middle of the summer with a sleeved wife beater
Pure bred degenerate, gentleman
Little Aryan nigga with hairy clit for dinner
It's Wolf Gang, triple six, niggas on that simple shit
I'm on a fuckin' spree burnin' bodies in a rental whip
Wolf Gang rad, no bum ass shit
So since the fans laggin', now they're tryna come back quick
Ask from Dera to Fax, they say fuck that shit
We half African swaggin' of course we run that shit

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I been sick, since I was un-mixed and mastered
Blastin' Bastard, screamin' fuck another rapper
O.F. soldier, Buffalo Bill, don't think I will
But I'm a gunner for the Bills like Tasker
I'm the cream of the crop
Officers in the trunk with six other cops
No way that I'll stop, they'll arrest me after
Fix the scene just to put me on screen like an actor
Shit, no need to tell me I know it's hot
As weather where them bitches wear bikinis with polka-dots
It's overly overkill, because my niggas know a lot
About tapin' them, rapin' them, throw them overboard from a yacht
So now they probably hate me but that's why the fuck I'm here
And you really should man up, there's no need to be sincere, faggot
Heard that you we're queer, why would you fuck with Wolves
That'll leave you on the ground like your rap career?
So you don't want it don't start none
We're fuckin' Radical, been Fuckin' Awesome
Talked a lotta shit so for words you're at a loss
Raised enough money just to get someone to kill my boss
Now that's a fuckin' suit for hire
Hang her higher, light a fire, fuck my former supervisor
I'm the truth, you're a liar, blue as clues, I inspire
Odd Future muthafucka, I'm your new supplier[Verse 1] (Mike)
Take it to the point where our wallets don't fold up
Im talking investments and stockholders
Drink 12 beers, 12 bitches, 12 glazed donuts
Yeah, i brought the gang with me and im the one they came to see
That's why i always aim to be, more than what you claim to be
But seems like you can't wait to be, tipping on them 44's
Stomping nigga's out like kids and we wearing box logos

[Chorus]
Cowtippin, Day Tripping, Never Slipping
Often fights with 7 christian's
Flying high like a 9/11 victim
And i look up like a 9/11 victim

[Verse 2] (Vince)
My grandmother ask when im a get a job
I tell her when i get a dad
But for now im jacking off and leave for i beat yo ass
Skipping school and get in my mother fallen
So unless you're good at math, that's something that you shouldn't ask
Mexicans inside your kitchen making sure it's spick & span
Racial Slur
