[Verse 1]
Wild Wild West (Yeahhhhhhhahhhhhhhh!)
Jim West, desperado
Rough rider, no you don't want nada
None of this, six-gunnin this, brother runnin this
Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told ya
Any damsel that's in distress
Be outta that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step or flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at
With Artemus, from the start of this, runnin the game
James West, tamin the West, so remember the name

[Will Smith]

[Will Smith] * [Sisqo] (shared lines in caps)
Now, now, now
Now once upon a time in the West
Mad man lost his damn mind in the West
Loveless, KIDNAP A DIME, nuttin less
Now I must, PUT HIS BEHIND TO THE TEST [S: Can you feel me?]
Then through the shadows, in the saddle, ready for battle
Bring all your boys in, here come the poison
Behind my back, all that riffin ya did
Front and center, now where your lip at kid? [S: Lookin at me!]
Who dat is? A mean brother, bad for your health
Lookin damn good though, if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that
He got mad weapons too? Ain't tryin to hear that
Tryin to bring down me, THE CHAMPION?
When y'all clowns gon' see that it CAN'T BE DONE
Understand me son, I'm the slickest they is
I'm the quickest they is [S: Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh]
Did I say I'm the slickest they is?
So if you barkin up the, wrong tree we comin
Don't be startin nuttin, me and my partner gonna
Test your chest, Loveless
Can't stand the heat, then get out the Wild, Wild, West

To any outlaw tryin to draw, thinkin you're bad

Ten paces and turn (one.. two.. three..) just for fun, son *BANG*
Up til sundown, rollin around

The Wild Wild WestThe wild wild west (repeat 16x)

I used to live downtown, 129th Street
Convent, everything's upbeat
Parties, ball in the park
Nothing, but girls after dark
We chill, nobody gets ill
In the place we call the hill
But if you try 'em
That's when they will
Get wild, but they don't fight, they kill
At the...

The wild wild west (repeat 4x)

I remember parties out in the park
With the girlies, rubbing up in the dark
I was smooth, until someone pulled a gun
It was over, they spoiled my fun
I was flying, just like a track star
Dying, nah, I ran through the back yard
Trying to get into my building
Thinking, "Why in the heck won't somebody kill them?"
One day the fellas got together
They vowed that no one would ever
Come on our block, and terrorize us
The gangs that used to do it, now they idolize us
Guns, we don't like to use them
Unless, our enemies choose them
We prefer to fight you on like a man
And beat you down with our hands and bodyslam you at the...

The wild wild west (repeat 4x)

We don't start trouble, but boy do we end it
Our time, we like to spend it
Snapping, boy do we heat up
But we'll take time out to beat up
A sucker, if he wants static
Beatdown, yeah we got it
Good, and we'll accomidate you
Thanks to us, a lot of brothers hate to
Come back, to this very day
Cause losing's one thing we don't play
If you're ever in a fight and you're beating one of us
Break out, before you get bumrushed
At the...

The wild wild west (repeat 16x)

I'm talking about Nazareth, B.O., Tony and Milton
Mike Mike Sluggo and Mike Chillion
D.O.B., Reggie B, and Sidney
Dana B, Derrick B, Sean B, and don't forget
Big Hank, Don Ice and Sire Rock
God bless Peter Wax, Chuck Chuck, and Po Rock
El Dorado George way back in the day
Had all the brothers on the hill talking this way
They said, "God, have mercy L.A
Sunshine," and my DJ
Easy Lee, are from aroud the way
Jock Jock, Philly Phil, Don D always
But they're chillin, Keith Keith, KV
Steve O, Ross Ross and A Fi
Beroni, Toss Toss and Hung Hunk
We fight with our hands and nobody's a punk!
At the...

The wild wild westBut three days later, go see the doctor...

I was, walking down the street, rocking my beat
Clapping my hands and stomping my feet
I saw a little lady so neet and petite
So was so sweet, yes I wanted to meet
So I asked this lady could I take her out
We could wine and dine and we could talk about
The birds and the bees in my waterbed
And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head
We continued to talk, and before you knew it
We were at my house and it was time to do it
As soon as I finished, I lost my poise
Ran outside and told all my boys
I said "Listen up fellas, come over here, bust it"
They said "Did you get it?" I said "Yeah," they said "How was it?"
The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor

I rocked her to the left, rocked her to the right
She felt so good, hugged me so tight
I said "Good night"
Three days later...
Woke up fussing, yelling and cussing
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing
I went to the bathroom and said "Mama mia!"
I'm a kill that girl next time I see her
The madder I got, the more I reminice
Why is my thing thing burning like this?
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl
I just couldn't wait to rock her world
I said "Hey good looking, what you got cooking?"
What have I done stuck my dick in?
Now I know why her ex-boyfriend Dave
Calls her Mrs. Microwave
Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
The hard way stay in the microwave too long you get burned
But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor

I went to the doctor's office, I said "What have I got?"
He said "Turn around boy and take this shot"
I looked at him like he was crazy, and I said "What?"
Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt
He turned and said in a real deep voice
"Have it your way, if that's your choice
And I'll put it down if you want me to put it
But don't blame me if it turns into a foot
Extending from the middle of your body
And the next time you see your cute hottie
You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do
Is just kick her, so go take karate"
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said "Next time I'll use some protection"
If I see another girl and I get an erection
I'm walking in the other direction
Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance
So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor[Verse 1]
I go to work
Like a doctor
When I rock the mic
You got to like
The way I operate
I make miracles happen
Just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent
And I'm flowin'
And explodin'
On the scene mean
I got the potential
To make you go
Then chill
I got the credentials
That is so essential
To make a rhyme
And chill
Then you know
I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill
As I build a guild
For all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy
If he's a sucker
Hang 'em to the left of me
Cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own
And my game plan
Is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush
It ain't no race
I'mma hit the top
Just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time
And I'm gonna
Cause I know when to
Go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap
That sent ya
Runnin' around
Holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy
Yo man
You hear what he said
Another funky rhythm
Look at ya man
And give him a high five
Cause I'm live
Runnin' around with him
Telling everybody
Hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up
And check the clock
Punch it

[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 2]
I go to work
Like an architect
I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter it becomes visably better
Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vaction
I came to roam
The land I own
And stand alone on the microphone
Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace
Start the race
I'm coming in first
With each verse
I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya
I have to slap ya
Senseless with
Endless rhymes don't pretned this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done
Your mind will become
So trapped in the rap
You'll lust on another one
But you gotta wait it takes time
I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim, to outfox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya
So hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks
So power packed
Before you can react
You're flat on your back
Down for the count
Get up and dismount
Cause I'm coming
With an endless amount
Of words in a hurry
Like a flurry
A collage to camouflage
The power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote
I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Writing my rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow
You blow
You know you go
I flow
I throw all pro
I go to work

[Break]

To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation
I get paid to rock the nation

[Hook]I throw my tape on
And I watch ya
Three second later
I got ya, shakin' your head
Dancin' instead of sittin'
The rhymes kick
The beats hittin' you
Just like a home run
Slammin' like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James,like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC
Gettin' paid , usin' my rap style
And I'm playin' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that
You can forget that
You took my style
I'm takin' it back
I'm come back like "Return of the Jedi"
Sucker MC's in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes
Only rock crowds
But never rock records

How ya like me now (x2)

Now brothers are riding me
Like a pony
I'm no phony
I'm the only real micaroni
Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played
New jacks,you all shoulda stayed out of the business
What is this,amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage,I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped in a cage
I'm the real king , rap is a jungle
I never understood,how could one go
To a party,watch me,stand around and jock me
Become a rapper,then try to rock me
Scheming like a demon,you're screamin' and dreamin'
I'm from the old school,I used to see men
Dies for less,but I'm not living that way
I'll let my mic do the talkin'
And let the music play

How ya like me now (x2)

Rap is an art
And I'm a Picasso
But of course
Why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes,but they won't fit ya
I'm bigger and better,forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic,I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again,respect,I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of
Vernacular's pure and I can insure
Life od death with my breath,my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's , I'll make your girl say "ow"
She's jockin'
How ya like me now (x2)

It irked my nerve
When I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test?
I'm not impressed
Get real, you're nothin' but a toy.
Don't ya know I'll serve that boy?
Just like a waiter
Hit'em with a plate of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he
Pay the bill, and leave him standin' still
When he's had enough, hit him with a refill
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dream.
Make him feel the wrath, beat him down and laugh
And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him
"Who is the best?" And if he don't say, "Moe Dee,"
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby.
Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat
Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did
How could you beat me?
You're so petrified
You're scared to even meet me
My word's the law
That's why you don't beef
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief
So I'm puttin' you on punishment
Just like a child:
Never touch another mic

How ya like me now (x2)

I could continue
There's more on the menu
But I'll relax 'cos I'm so far in you
You had enough
I know you're overstuffed
And if I keep going
You'll be throwin' up
Old rhymes I used to say
Way back in the day
When you used to come to my
Parties and pay
Nobody's ever gonna rock me
And this I vow
So all I wanna say is

How ya like me now? (X2)

How ya like me now (fade out with echo)To the Break of dawn
To the, to the, to the
Times up punk
Yea yea Time to settle the score
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
Ha, ha, ha this time it's over boy
This is me and you, head to head, let's go

Here we go, beat down round 2
Heads up punk cause it all comes down to
Me and you, face to face, head to head
Mic to mic, I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn, beats nitro
Lyrics weak, say goodnight 'cho
Star Trek shades, man cut the joke
Let's get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pitbull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr. Pitiful
Here's some mouthwash, g
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap, C-
A-U-S-E, you're rhyme didn't mean
?D-O-D-D?, junior Moe Dee
Stop biting, chewing, swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son, I need jock relief
Here's a toothpick, now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it, yea, finish, burp
Now let a real man go to work
Cause I'm a whip you like your daddy, beat ya like a baby
Sick ya like a dog, dropping lyrics wit rabies
Cut ya like a knife cause you're nuthin but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
I'm a treat ya like a hooker punk, change your clothes
Put you on the streets wit ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
You're trying to come off and don't know how to come
You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you wit a death blow

(Chorus)
Kill 'em kill 'em
I'll hit ya wit a death blow

My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma
Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears of violence
Get your black suits cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit
A rhyme silencer, I hit 'em wit a death blow

Chorus

If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marley Marl can't save you from fallin
Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lafidasical, lispless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local
Now LL's a laughing stock
Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, whos' your daddy

Kill 'em... Big daddy, I don't want none...
I did 'em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the, get him out of here

(Kool Moe Dee Talks)Ladies and gentlemen
Gentlemen and ladies
Adults teenagers adolescents and babies
No if's and's but's or maybe's
I want the whole world to rock today
Because I said I was and always was
The baddest rapper on the mic and I proved it does
Make a difference
On the way you think you syn-
Cronize the wise tries
To overcome the dumb the drum
Beats a pattern that turns into
A catalyst that'll just
Grab your ear you had to hear
A rhyme's contents
Beyond nonsense
If you're not convinced
Get tense and wince
Cause I'll make a skeptic
Look epileptic
Shake and brake like the Holy Ghost connected
His body and soul
I control
His mind is mine cause my
Rhyme holds
Minds in limbo
You resemble
A clone of Jim Jones as them bones tremble
Shakin' like a leaf in disbelief
No chatterin' teeth
Can cease pity or grief
I got you flipping like a burger
Head spinning like a top
Weak at the knees
And you're about to drop
You can't find your heart
You need a warrant to search
Get off your knees
Boy this ain't church
You can pray if you wanna pray
Say what you wanna say
Did you forget you was ambiguous
You're gonna pay
For doubting my rhyme
You better freeze your thought
Cause I read minds
If you got caught
I taught
Lessons for second-guessing
Reroute doubt
I reprogram and deprogram about
Two million fans
Through rhytmic hypnosis
Left in a state
Of cataclysmic neurosis
Neurotic from a narcotic
Known as rhyme
Addicted to rap
And you're a fiend for mine
For my rap info
You're a nympho
I'll raise the conscience
And then hit them so hard with the rhyme
I'mma leave you scarred
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
I weave the bob
To do the job
Set you up with the left
As the right writes hard
Lyrics stick and move
Behind the groove
As the beat gets better
The rhyme improves
Adversaries prepare for a telling loss
Bring a stretcher nurse and the smelling salts
My rhyme is more
Than a fight or a bout
You ain't goin' down
Boy you're goin' out
No count necessary
Cause you ain't gettin' up
Bad mouthin' ends very
Very very abrupt
Thought patterns converted
Through overt overtures
Prepared your mind
Much better for metaphors
More rap classics
Believe me there's no man
Not Bach Brahms Beethoven or Chopin
Polonaise would ever faze ya
Like I faze ya I amaze ya
Ali and Fraizer I
Get deja vu from listening to
The rhymes that cut like an uppercut
And rings a bell too
I come out smoking
Hard from the first round
Stinging like a bee
And the bell is the worst sound
Cause I don't wanna let up
If you can get up
I'm fed up
The rhymes are sped up
To mess your head up
When the rhyme is over
They tally the scorecard
I get more points
Cause you hit the floor hard
But I'm hittin' hard
The very last thing
That you remember
Is a rhyme in your face
And the crowd yell timbre
Then you fall in a dopefiend nod
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
When I rain
It's more like a hurricane
You wanna dis
Then think of another name
Cause I go to work
And my rhymes slam
Put me to the test
You'll fail the exam
Cause that's the kind of test
You just can't study for
You're guaranteed
To end up bloody or
Broken twisted
Fractured blistered
Decapitated mutilated
Violated it's the
Kind of defeat
That you just can't live with
Try to compete
But you just can't get with
The Mental Master
Hard-ryhme supremist
My words have ya
Mixed like a chemist
My rhymes flow like
H-2-O
Cleaned with chlorine
To make green so
The rhyme is purified
You can't drink it
Biters and suckers
Don't even think it
The green I made
Is a money shade
When the rhyme evaporates
I get paid
Then it's time to rain
With the rhyme I know
And like plants
Watch my people grow
I heal sick minds
Like Christ himself
Touch the soul
Like no one else
There's only one
President Pope and one God
There's only one rapper
In that class
And I hit ya hardIt's about time
For some action
I'm hot as a tamale on fire
I need more than
A physical attraction
Cause lust is a weak desire
A woman without a good
Head on her shoulders
Is nothing but a piece of meat
For that I'll go to the butcher store
Cause I'm choosy about what I eat
The body is a mere appetizer
And the mind is the real main course
The personality is the icing on the cake
The real magnetic force
The completion of any kind of coffee
Makes my percolator perk
And once I taste the coffee
So get ready to work
All night long
How many ladies
Are deep enough
To handle a man
Like me
I mean mentally
Emotionally and physically
I like my women deep
I like 'em
Hot blooded by nature
But not promiscuous
A women who can relate to
Being spontaneous
And yet I like 'em old-fashioned
Updated with a modern day twist
A women that's a slave to passion
But know when to resist
I like a woman
That's not so public
Cause no one needs to know
And if you can respect my privacy
The forever we're good to go
All night long
Scintillating, sultry, stimulating, sexy
Super, subtle, smart, and seductive
Sensitive, serious, succulent, sensuous
Softly saying she loves this
Kind of
Mental stimulation
That's causing body heat
Visually anticipating
Making love between the sheets
Now I can't stand a groupie
But I'll always love a true fan
Someone ready to do me right
Once she knows the man
I admit I love it in public
Cause it's cool being Kool Moe Dee
But behind closed doors
I get the applause
For just being plain old me
All night long
I never like to make the first move
I'mma rapper but I don't rap
Cause when it comes to the ladies
I'm too smooth for that
I love a women with a good sense of humor
For me that is essential
Uninhibited and very deep
Someone I can really get into
And once I get into ya
I can feel if you're for real
And right is how I'll do ya
I'll give you something you can feel
It's like a romance
Right out of a storybook
Without the
Wine and candles
An encounter
You'll never forget
But don't try it
If you can't handle
All night long[ all ]

[ VERSE 1: Ice-T ]
Ice-T, let me kick my credentials
A young player, bred in South Central
L.A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: "Lay down!"
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: "Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
Rap on my record, man, Kimiko, send Ice the beat"
The Dude is def no doubt, what can I say?
The man can roll with Ice-T or Michael J

I'm back, on the block, on the screen
I'm on the wax, I'm on the stage, I'm on the scene
I'm on the case, just like an attorney
The Dude took me on a magic journey
To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

(Ain't nothin gonna bother Stokie much)
Some say they can't take it no more

Back up and give the brother room
To let poetry bloom to whom
It may concern or consume
As I reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about a twist
Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so
Jesse Jackson, Miss America a black one
No more livin for just a small fraction
I was once told by the Dude that knowledge is a food
To nourish, so to conclude
This from an Asiatic descendant, Big Daddy is shocked

An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

(Now I would - I would contend that ah -
The rappers - rap is here to stay)Other MC's, I want you to know
If you ever wanna battle me, don't move slow
Come and get it cause I'm waitin and I got nowhere to go
Head to head, toe to toe, rhyme for rhyme, blow for blow
We can throw

Badself

When I get busy, the crowd gets dizzy
And when I'm on the stage, the party people say, "Is he
Really human or is he a robot?"
Because when I'm on the microphone nobod-
Y does the things that I do
My voice will guide you
Once you hear it, it stays inside you
Hypnotizing and mesmerizing
The cerebral cortex, but without realizing
You become confused and so enthused
Cause the rhymes I use can make you lose
Total control, and if I choose
To call you the paperboy you'll spread the news
Like Paul Revere: "A real rapper is here!"
Yeah, "Moe Dee is coming, Moe Dee is coming"
And teeth will chatter, plagiarists will scatter
Nothing is the matter, you're just looking at a
Real rap trooper with a power so super
After battlin me, I guarantee you won't recouper-
Ate cause I am great, I can make you hate
To ever look in the mirror and affiliate
Yourself with anything but an average person
Lovin my success but envious and cursin
You want my autograph, don't act like a sucker
Just gimme a pound cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

I put a hurtin on rappers, egos are crushed
Pride is swallowed, asses are bust
Hearts are taken, souls cremated
Lips are sealed and they hate it
Overrated rappers made it
On a wing and a prayer with old beats updated
But I'm not like you bitin barbarics
Rappers with the fresh beats and weak lyrics
I'm cyanide, deadly and lethal
I never run out, I got an automatic refill
I never get cold, I only get lukewarm
When I wanna get hot, I have a real brainstorm
Ideas start flowin, my talents start showin
And if the music stops, Moe Dee keeps goin
I'm bigger than life and deeper than death
The world of rap is like a kitchen and I am the chef
Boy, are these MC's really startin to irk me
Make it to the top, then try to jerk me
Ask em who's the best, their shoulders start shruggin
Like they don't know, they must be buggin
But I like the controversy, it makes me blood-thirsty
And one day I'll make them all beg for mercy
So remember that if you wanna act like a sucker
Don't ever make me mad cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

I'm the kinda rapper that a dummy won't dig
My IQ's too high, my words are too big
My voice too clear and my rhymes are ample
Some things I won't do, and here's an example
I won't make a 'La-Di-Da-Di', an 'Oh Veronica'
A 'Dear Yvette' or a La-'Latoya'
I'm not tryin to dis the rappers that made these cuts
As a matter of fact I like them, but
Records like that are for the average MC
Not for the highly rated Moe Dee
I have a formula, I'm like a scientist
And I must put words together like this--
My voice is auriferous, coming out an orifice
Expressing hyperbole, verbally or if it's
Mental [?] that makes me so electric
By spontaneous combustion an explosion is expected
A walking time bomb that can't be disconnected
I'm a rhymer with a timer, I'm a english dialectic
My ideas are impeccable, rhymes are paragon
My soliloquy will affect ya like Farrakhan
Love me or hate me, agree or debate me
Watchin suckers gather 'round, bow down and fellate me
Cause what I do orally is something so morally
Stimulating, emulating heat that's [?]
My mind is both flexible and resillient
Pugnacious, tenacious, vivacious, I'm brilliant
Through rigorous training, it's self-explaining
Why I'm standing on the top and that's where I'm remaining
My brain rocks like Mr. Spock's
And any other MC's are knocked out the box
So you know where to kiss, so line up and pucker
Sucker MC's, I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad (mutha-)

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

Now I was never solo, I was always in a group
So now you new jacks are a little too souped
So if you think you could take mine
Then come on and make my
Day, you idiot, you knew from the giddy-up
You didn't have a chance
But if you want drop the pants
I spank that ass so fast that the next time you glance
Everyone will be laughing and you'll be the stock
Cause that's what's good about havin you MC's on the jock
I could go on and on and on and on for days
But everytime I speak I get unwanted protegees
If you've been lucky so far, don't press your luck
Cause you don't really want none cause I'm a bad, bad, bad (mutha-)

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-To the Break of dawn
To the, to the, to the
Times up punk
Yea yea Time to settle the score
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
Ha, ha, ha this time it's over boy
This is me and you, head to head, let's go

Here we go, beat down round 2
Heads up punk cause it all comes down to
Me and you, face to face, head to head
Mic to mic, I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn, beats nitro
Lyrics weak, say goodnight 'cho
Star Trek shades, man cut the joke
Let's get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pitbull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr. Pitiful
Here's some mouthwash, g
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap, C-
A-U-S-E, you're rhyme didn't mean
?D-O-D-D?, junior Moe Dee
Stop biting, chewing, swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son, I need jock relief
Here's a toothpick, now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it, yea, finish, burp
Now let a real man go to work
Cause I'm a whip you like your daddy, beat ya like a baby
Sick ya like a dog, dropping lyrics wit rabies
Cut ya like a knife cause you're nuthin but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
I'm a treat ya like a hooker punk, change your clothes
Put you on the streets wit ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
You're trying to come off and don't know how to come
You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you wit a death blow

(Chorus)
Kill 'em kill 'em
I'll hit ya wit a death blow

My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma
Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears of violence
Get your black suits cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit
A rhyme silencer, I hit 'em wit a death blow

Chorus

If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marley Marl can't save you from fallin
Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lafidasical, lispless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local
Now LL's a laughing stock
Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, whos' your daddy

Kill 'em... Big daddy, I don't want none...
I did 'em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the, get him out of here

Once again it's the brain goin against the grain
Here to entertain and rip em out of the frame
Heatin up like a flame, watch the heat maintain
As I take aim at the lame rap game
Ain't it a shame? (rap is goin crazy)
The lyrical skills (are gettin kinda lazy)
The gift they're shootin (couldn't even graze me)
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play, gee
Now who drops rhymes for the mind, only a handful
Only the deaf, dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness, flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet, I'm tired of hearin this
'Bang bang, shoot em up, ba-boo, you get buck-bucked'
If you ain't down with what's up
Then you can get with these...

Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties, and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasn't
Nothin lyrical, hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters, nothin against your
Fake lifestyle, but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive, cause it's inedited you think it's better with
Explicit illicit lyrics - but like a sedative
The rhymes ain't hype, so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brother's flow's like
So here come the flow, the lovable, huggable, colorful flow
The brother that glows, in the dark, cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows, I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe, the highs and lows
It's up and down and out you go
So back up, re-group, slow down and check the cut
And if you still ain't down, get up on these...

I always wondered how a rapper never could wreck shop
But if he had a funky track and a fat hook, he'd get props
Treated like some kind of hero, most of em come no where near Moe
If you call them number one, I know that I got to be zero
I come before the one, I'm second to none
I come in the circumference 360, as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High, you know the rhyme's most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene, I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets, I sinks the ships
So one shot, aye captain, I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin they're mackin, so I pimp-slap em
Showin em who's large in charge, runnin em up outta dodge
This is a hostile take-over, I'm takin over, searg
Give me your stripes and your mics, enough is enough

Girlies are partying, touching my body and
Talking to me like I'm a kindergartian
Today she's on mine, tomorrow she's on his
But don't worry about me, because I know what time it is
Time to get mine while you try to get yours
I'll get mine pause in those silky drawers
Take you to the cleaners and I got a trick
Cause all you're ever going to get is a piece of my dee-dee-duh
Didn't you know that my girlie, my toe
It's easy to come, but harder to go
Hope you got a good heart and you're a good sport
Cause I'm a treat you like Beaver on a basketball court
I'm gonna run you around, take you up and down
Take you out and leave you in the lost and found
So if you wanna be down, miss listen to this
Before you deal with me, you'd better know what time it is

Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)

Some girlies are pretty, some girlies are fine
But most girlie girlies like to play with your mind
They like sporting new gold and riding in cars
And most of them, they don't care who you are
They're materialistic and unrealistic
And to most of them you're nothing but another statistic
Whoever's got the money, they're all on his
Y'all can save it for David, cause I know what time it is

Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)
Check the clock!

Put your Gucci watch on and synchronize the time, and let's rock

Girls for me come a dime a dozen
And that's why I never never was a
Situation where I could get jerked
Like a mechanic, all I do is bodywork
Want my money?  You must be a fool
Cause like Billy Idol said, I'm gigalo cool
Moe Dee, that's me, introduce yourself, miss
But don't try to be slick, cause I know what time it is
Time to make sure that the girlies stay poised
String 'em out so they will always want more
Don't come around here and try to get richer
Don't ask me for no money, cause baby baby baby
Betcha don't know me from a can of paint
And I bet you think I'm fronting but I tell you I ain't
And I bet you think you know, but I'll tell you like this:
I'll be you don't know (Know what?) What time it is

Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 4x)

It's time to get money, time to get paid
It's time to have fun, it's time to get laid
Like to front like I'm poor, I don't drive, instead
I be chilling in a Jetta with my man that be red
Riding all around the city and half the world
And after talking from girl to girl
All you ladies seem to sing the same old song
Makes it hard for me when a real girl comes along
Now I'm a veteran, a girl all-pro
And as many as I've had, I still don't know
So I made a little system so I can tell
Doesn't always work, but what the hell?
Don't ask me for nothing, and don't give me nothing
And keep it like that for about a whole month and
Half and I'll laugh and maybe one day miss
Maybe you can be down, maybe you can be down
Maybe you should be down cause you know what time it is

Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)
Check the clock!

Put your Gucci watch on and synchronize the time, and let's rockBut three days later, go see the doctor...

I was, walking down the street, rocking my beat
Clapping my hands and stomping my feet
I saw a little lady so neet and petite
So was so sweet, yes I wanted to meet
So I asked this lady could I take her out
We could wine and dine and we could talk about
The birds and the bees in my waterbed
And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head
We continued to talk, and before you knew it
We were at my house and it was time to do it
As soon as I finished, I lost my poise
Ran outside and told all my boys
I said "Listen up fellas, come over here, bust it"
They said "Did you get it?" I said "Yeah," they said "How was it?"
The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor

I rocked her to the left, rocked her to the right
She felt so good, hugged me so tight
I said "Good night"
Three days later...
Woke up fussing, yelling and cussing
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing
I went to the bathroom and said "Mama mia!"
I'm a kill that girl next time I see her
The madder I got, the more I reminice
Why is my thing thing burning like this?
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl
I just couldn't wait to rock her world
I said "Hey good looking, what you got cooking?"
What have I done stuck my dick in?
Now I know why her ex-boyfriend Dave
Calls her Mrs. Microwave
Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
The hard way stay in the microwave too long you get burned
But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor

I went to the doctor's office, I said "What have I got?"
He said "Turn around boy and take this shot"
I looked at him like he was crazy, and I said "What?"
Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt
He turned and said in a real deep voice
"Have it your way, if that's your choice
And I'll put it down if you want me to put it
But don't blame me if it turns into a foot
Extending from the middle of your body
And the next time you see your cute hottie
You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do
Is just kick her, so go take karate"
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said "Next time I'll use some protection"
If I see another girl and I get an erection
I'm walking in the other direction
Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance
So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor[Kool Moe Dee]

I got so many rhymes, you gotta take invoice

[Run]
Now party people, I'm so happy I don't know what to do
Cause I'm the emcee with the rock, cold down with the crew
Rhyme from Africa to France, and then to Kalamazoo
And every place that I play, I hear a "Yeah" and a "Woo!"

Well, I know that when a party is packed
You need a guide to show you when and where to react
You need a motivator -- that means you'll need me
Special K, huh, from the Treacherous Three

I love to perform, but I'm not a ham

And I can do it cause I know I can

Action!I throw my tape on
And I watch ya
Three second later
I got ya, shakin' your head
Dancin' instead of sittin'
The rhymes kick
The beats hittin' you
Just like a home run
Slammin' like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James,like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC
Gettin' paid , usin' my rap style
And I'm playin' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that
You can forget that
You took my style
I'm takin' it back
I'm come back like "Return of the Jedi"
Sucker MC's in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes
Only rock crowds
But never rock records

How ya like me now (x2)

Now brothers are riding me
Like a pony
I'm no phony
I'm the only real micaroni
Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played
New jacks,you all shoulda stayed out of the business
What is this,amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage,I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped in a cage
I'm the real king , rap is a jungle
I never understood,how could one go
To a party,watch me,stand around and jock me
Become a rapper,then try to rock me
Scheming like a demon,you're screamin' and dreamin'
I'm from the old school,I used to see men
Dies for less,but I'm not living that way
I'll let my mic do the talkin'
And let the music play

How ya like me now (x2)

Rap is an art
And I'm a Picasso
But of course
Why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes,but they won't fit ya
I'm bigger and better,forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic,I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again,respect,I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of
Vernacular's pure and I can insure
Life od death with my breath,my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's , I'll make your girl say "ow"
She's jockin'
How ya like me now (x2)

It irked my nerve
When I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test?
I'm not impressed
Get real, you're nothin' but a toy.
Don't ya know I'll serve that boy?
Just like a waiter
Hit'em with a plate of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he
Pay the bill, and leave him standin' still
When he's had enough, hit him with a refill
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dream.
Make him feel the wrath, beat him down and laugh
And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him
"Who is the best?" And if he don't say, "Moe Dee,"
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby.
Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat
Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did
How could you beat me?
You're so petrified
You're scared to even meet me
My word's the law
That's why you don't beef
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief
So I'm puttin' you on punishment
Just like a child:
Never touch another mic

How ya like me now (x2)

I could continue
There's more on the menu
But I'll relax 'cos I'm so far in you
You had enough
I know you're overstuffed
And if I keep going
You'll be throwin' up
Old rhymes I used to say
Way back in the day
When you used to come to my
Parties and pay
Nobody's ever gonna rock me
And this I vow
So all I wanna say is

How ya like me now? (X2)

How ya like me now (fade out with echo)[Verse 1]
I go to work
Like a doctor
When I rock the mic
You got to like
The way I operate
I make miracles happen
Just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent
And I'm flowin'
And explodin'
On the scene mean
I got the potential
To make you go
Then chill
I got the credentials
That is so essential
To make a rhyme
And chill
Then you know
I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill
As I build a guild
For all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy
If he's a sucker
Hang 'em to the left of me
Cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own
And my game plan
Is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush
It ain't no race
I'mma hit the top
Just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time
And I'm gonna
Cause I know when to
Go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap
That sent ya
Runnin' around
Holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy
Yo man
You hear what he said
Another funky rhythm
Look at ya man
And give him a high five
Cause I'm live
Runnin' around with him
Telling everybody
Hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up
And check the clock
Punch it

[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 2]
I go to work
Like an architect
I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter it becomes visably better
Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vaction
I came to roam
The land I own
And stand alone on the microphone
Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace
Start the race
I'm coming in first
With each verse
I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya
I have to slap ya
Senseless with
Endless rhymes don't pretned this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done
Your mind will become
So trapped in the rap
You'll lust on another one
But you gotta wait it takes time
I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim, to outfox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya
So hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks
So power packed
Before you can react
You're flat on your back
Down for the count
Get up and dismount
Cause I'm coming
With an endless amount
Of words in a hurry
Like a flurry
A collage to camouflage
The power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote
I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Writing my rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow
You blow
You know you go
I flow
I throw all pro
I go to work

[Break]

To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation
I get paid to rock the nation

[Hook]I'm T-N-T and I just can't lose
An E-M-C-E-E with a fuse
When it's lit I'm hit with the lyrical wit
Of a scientist, that's tryin' this

Sugar coated, rhyme loaded with gunpowder
Now see how the crowd will yell louder
Now the rhyme is dropped and you hear a pop
Think it's a shot but you just can't stop

Your heartbeat vibrates at my rate
So why wait, I hate to be irate
Anger causes rhyme combustion
Like a tornado the winds start gustin'

Rhymes unload, reload, and explode
Ride the same wave Malcolm X rode
On a higher level cause I left the rest
Outcast, outlast, F the press

When I hit, it's like a bulldozer
Boom and there goes ya
Whole world up in smoke
When I go I go for broke, I'm blowing up

I'm on the hype tip
I'm on the mic with
Tunnel vision
Cause I'm mic whipped

Strung from lung to tongue
I breathe rhymes that come from

A zone that's hidden and forbidden
If any man enters, good riddance
A mortal mind is just no contest
The rhyme zone is my conquest

The Twilight Zone will seem like child's play
Am I a genius? Heheh, I'll say
I'm so cool and yet so hyped
When I'm on the mic it's something like

Hirojima, remember Pearl Harbor
Feel the fire but don't bother
To run for cover you don't escape
On record compact disc or tape

Once you play it the fuse is lit
An explosion, you getting hit
With rhythmic prophecies, visions I foresee
Me blowing up in your face now stop to see

Smoke fumes in the shape of a mushroom
Cloud the room because I went boom
I'll light the sky like a comet
When it comes to rap, I'm it, I'm blowing up

[Bigger and better, forget about deffer scratched]

I'm blowin' up for the fans that crave
Hip hop with relevance I'm here to save
Rap from an early grave like god I gave
Life to the mic as I watch it enslave

All the sellouts who yell out
Obscenities and spell out
M-O-N-E-Y to propel out

Of the ghetto, but like Othello
You kill the mic, a cappella
You're in the cellar
You rap like

Rap is a dash for cash
You'll run out of gas
It's a marathon
How long can you last

With repetitious nothing
Renditions of something
You can't create
So you imitate the pumping

Only the strongest can last as long as
I last, my reign is the longest
In hip-hop history, check the book
Victory after victory, man look

Rapping is a science, the mic is an appliance
So I applied it to an alliance
Of words, put them in a rhyme song
Blew them up, like a time bomb

Other emcees caught the debris
Little bits and pieces of me
Put my ideas on a track you laid
Is like pulling my pen and I'm a grenade, I'm blowing up

Clap, your hands to that
Old track that brought back the man that raps
Much better than the next man, I'll take an ex-fan
And make them rock harder than any other brother can

Whoever didn't understand my game plan
Should feel ashamed like a lame cause I'm the same man
That ran the rap yard for years, worked hard for years
But never got paid and slaved and starved for years

Then other rappers came off with rhymes that are soft
I went with the flow and you said I fell off, hah
Don't be bogus, where's your focus?
I did what I had to, now notice

The dollars are rolling, no more holding
Back the rap attack I'm back on top controlling
The whole rap game again, like I did way back when
Def Jam was a dream, I was slaying men

Whoever thinks he wants some, he don't want none
He's got to be insane or just plain dumb
But if you think you got something to prove
Jump, make your move

But come in a tank and ten suits of armor
I won't whip ya, I'll bomb ya
And when you're on fire it still ain't enough
Cause I don't just burn you boy, I blow ya upLadies and gentlemen
Gentlemen and ladies
Adults teenagers adolescents and babies
No if's and's but's or maybe's
I want the whole world to rock today
Because I said I was and always was
The baddest rapper on the mic and I proved it does
Make a difference
On the way you think you syn-
Cronize the wise tries
To overcome the dumb the drum
Beats a pattern that turns into
A catalyst that'll just
Grab your ear you had to hear
A rhyme's contents
Beyond nonsense
If you're not convinced
Get tense and wince
Cause I'll make a skeptic
Look epileptic
Shake and brake like the Holy Ghost connected
His body and soul
I control
His mind is mine cause my
Rhyme holds
Minds in limbo
You resemble
A clone of Jim Jones as them bones tremble
Shakin' like a leaf in disbelief
No chatterin' teeth
Can cease pity or grief
I got you flipping like a burger
Head spinning like a top
Weak at the knees
And you're about to drop
You can't find your heart
You need a warrant to search
Get off your knees
Boy this ain't church
You can pray if you wanna pray
Say what you wanna say
Did you forget you was ambiguous
You're gonna pay
For doubting my rhyme
You better freeze your thought
Cause I read minds
If you got caught
I taught
Lessons for second-guessing
Reroute doubt
I reprogram and deprogram about
Two million fans
Through rhytmic hypnosis
Left in a state
Of cataclysmic neurosis
Neurotic from a narcotic
Known as rhyme
Addicted to rap
And you're a fiend for mine
For my rap info
You're a nympho
I'll raise the conscience
And then hit them so hard with the rhyme
I'mma leave you scarred
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
I weave the bob
To do the job
Set you up with the left
As the right writes hard
Lyrics stick and move
Behind the groove
As the beat gets better
The rhyme improves
Adversaries prepare for a telling loss
Bring a stretcher nurse and the smelling salts
My rhyme is more
Than a fight or a bout
You ain't goin' down
Boy you're goin' out
No count necessary
Cause you ain't gettin' up
Bad mouthin' ends very
Very very abrupt
Thought patterns converted
Through overt overtures
Prepared your mind
Much better for metaphors
More rap classics
Believe me there's no man
Not Bach Brahms Beethoven or Chopin
Polonaise would ever faze ya
Like I faze ya I amaze ya
Ali and Fraizer I
Get deja vu from listening to
The rhymes that cut like an uppercut
And rings a bell too
I come out smoking
Hard from the first round
Stinging like a bee
And the bell is the worst sound
Cause I don't wanna let up
If you can get up
I'm fed up
The rhymes are sped up
To mess your head up
When the rhyme is over
They tally the scorecard
I get more points
Cause you hit the floor hard
But I'm hittin' hard
The very last thing
That you remember
Is a rhyme in your face
And the crowd yell timbre
Then you fall in a dopefiend nod
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
When I rain
It's more like a hurricane
You wanna dis
Then think of another name
Cause I go to work
And my rhymes slam
Put me to the test
You'll fail the exam
Cause that's the kind of test
You just can't study for
You're guaranteed
To end up bloody or
Broken twisted
Fractured blistered
Decapitated mutilated
Violated it's the
Kind of defeat
That you just can't live with
Try to compete
But you just can't get with
The Mental Master
Hard-ryhme supremist
My words have ya
Mixed like a chemist
My rhymes flow like
H-2-O
Cleaned with chlorine
To make green so
The rhyme is purified
You can't drink it
Biters and suckers
Don't even think it
The green I made
Is a money shade
When the rhyme evaporates
I get paid
Then it's time to rain
With the rhyme I know
And like plants
Watch my people grow
I heal sick minds
Like Christ himself
Touch the soul
Like no one else
There's only one
President Pope and one God
There's only one rapper
In that class
And I hit ya hardWhat are you crazy, you know who I am
(Moe Dee!) yes, I'm the man
I am the flyest, cleanest, baddest, meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
I'll take you where I wanna go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if there's someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross, they'll say, 'don't you know?
Really, really, really don't you know?'
Cause I'm a real rap warrior, Elite Astoria
I'll take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And I'll prove that they're all ducks
Cause I don't care nothin 'bout your money and gold
Don't wanna hear about how many recrods you sold
Cause none of that don't mean nothin to me
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee

What are you senile, have you lost your mind?
I'm the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rapper's hall of fame, bein that it's all a game
I might not be down, because some rappers got a name
From screamin and yellin with hot records sellin
But your rhymes are smellin, that's why I'm tellin
You, when I go, homeboy, I'm gone
Cause I'm better but don't get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant, my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And we're all enemies on the court
But when the game is over I'll shake your hand
Give ya a pound, cause you're still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy, it's a new game plan
Cause I gotta disrespect ya, try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown cause I'm an intellect, ya
Bird brain rappers I call hip-happers
Not hip-hoppers, cause y'all just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins, soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But I'm perfect, I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but no Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee

Don't piss me, I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off? Don't diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers, beam em up, take their minds and broaden it
Set em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by mega-millions, you witness a burst
Of a new society, rappers with variety
So much prestige, flair and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
It's hard to believe but think about it, it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
There's no race no contest, I'll never have to jostle
They're small time, to them I am collossal
I'm a gladiator with the image of a god
I'm powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm, recite em as poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement, lo and behold
The Ice Man cometh, Kool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god, apex of the hip-hop cult
I'm the leader rhyme breeder, yes, I am the ult-
Imate idolized figure, there's not a name bigger
Than Kool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and that's cause I
Really feel that I'm the best, so I personify
Rap to the fullest, I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I don't stop rockin under no condition
I rock non-stop but don't ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion, some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion?
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if it's your brain, the answer's of course cause I'm a
Auto-hypnotic, reverse-pschotic
That'll make you feel, if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe DeeI ain't goin'
I'm gone
Up up up and away
And I'm on
A higher plane
With a brain
With a flame
Feel the fire
Desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom
And understanding
Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level
Read the Holy Koran
Or the Bible
Because it's liable
To be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Who wants some
Come get it
A battle is a test of wits
And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music
Alright hit it
Now that it feels good
I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
And don't ever glance
At a book or look
For their mind to advance
Caught in a rut
Chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar
Or trying to get a nut
Evil feeds
Off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind
And of course you have to be
Less than a man
More like a thing
No knowledge you're nothin'
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My rhymes make
A meak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang
So eject it
I've selected
Rhymes for records
To affect the effect
Of the rhyme that left
Hangin' like a pound
That came down
But you're hangin' the brain
So your brain's hell-bound
Lost and found
By the serpent's sound
What you don't know
Can't hurt that's profound
Or absurd
A better word
An ingnorant fool
Is a real cool nerd
Pockets are fat
With an empty head
Got a little fame and a name
And you're brain dead
You count dollars
So ya think ya in
What good is knowing how to count
If you don't know when
And history today
And it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes
Cause the brain ain't acute ya
Need knowledge
To understand
The concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand
So we have to fight
War
Killing people we never
Saw before
Most don't eden know
What they're killin' for
Following rulers
Instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya
But the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled
It's a spiritual thing
But you got the knowledge
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My knowledge comes
From a spiritual force
Stonger than any
Earthly source
Propaganda
Hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
I understand the
Media dictates
The mind and rotates
The way you think
And syncopates slow pace
Brains
Can't maintain
Acertain
Insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame
Traditions
All praise fame
Positions
Want to be a star
Drive a big car
Live bourgeios
Ane won't know who you are
Lost in the source
And praising the dollar
Whether your faith is
Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God
Will teach one thing
The dollar is moot
Knowledge is kingIntro

Reporter: So tell me... How do you feel about 'Jack the Ripper'?

[Evil Thriller laughter]

(Get him!)

[Verse 1]
Want me to get him? Well I got him
My mouth is an Uzi and I shot him
With the hundreds of rhymes and rhythm designed
To make him rewind this time I draw the line
He's mine...just chill
Don't nobody touch him cos I'mma get ill
The boy's phony as a three-dollar bill
And this time I shoot to kill
Just like a sucker you took the bait
Now you're like a dead fish on my dish, too late
So party people kick your feet up, I'm about to heat up
You're hungry for a battle, now it's time to eat up
Boy, I'm gonna chew you, cos I knew you was
Talkin' that junk, punk, now I'mma do you
The way you should be done, call you my son
Make you say "Daddy, I don't want none"
I've had enough of you actin' tough
You huff, puff, grab your stuff you cream puff bluff
Talk about a battle, but you don't wanna do it
You got yourself into it, you blew it
You egomaniac, I'm a brainiac
You came back with a stone cold plain attack
Your rhymes are weak-wack, how can you speak that?
You need to sneak back to the drawing board Jack...
The Ripper, down with my zipper
You get paid to be a Moe Dee tipster
Tryna knock the way I rock, get off my jock
I'mma knock you out the box, let's go...

Let's Go!

[Verse 2]
Put up or shut up, get up, yeah what up?
Huh, get on the microphone and get cut up
Talk about how your records went double platinum
With those lyrics?! Huh, I laugh at them
So you got paid, take the money you've made
Bet it on yourself, are you afraid?
Money talks, B.S. walks
When I stalk like a hawk a victory is chalked
So put your money where your mouth is, you don't know about this
Battlin's for real men, and I doubt if
You can even hang or give a run for the money
You're just a sucker, and it's funny
How you never ever had a drop of juice in New York
And now you go on tour and try to talk that talk
You try to act like you're a big man, but you're a big fag
Stridin' and hidin' while ridin' my big man
You ain't got a chance in the world
Your records were smokin', but you sound like a girl...
[How you like me now? I'm gettin' busier
I'm double platinum]
Hold up, is he a
Man or a girl? What in the world?
You sound like Cheryl the Pearl
And you wanna battle me on the microphone?
Leave that crack alone, let's go...

Let's Go!
I said, Let's Go!
Come on, boy! Let's Go!
Better than me?

[Verse 3]
Picture that with a Kodak
I don't take no shorts and you know that
I roll hard, run the rap yard, put up your guard
I don't get even, I get odd, Todd
Always one up on ya
And I tried to warn ya
You slept, you took a backstep
Ruined your rep and wept, you should've kept
Your mouth shut, you know what?
You gotta say you're sorry [I'm sorry] So what?
You call me a punk, you wanna see who's soft?
Put the microphone down, let's square-off
You need a hand, you got hands for
Tryna be me, now LL stands for
Lower Level, Lack Lustre
Last Least, Limp Lover
Lousy Lame, Latent Lethargic
Lazy Lemon, Little Logic
Lucky Leech, Liver Lipped
Laborious Louse on a Loser's Lips
Live in Limbo, Lyrical Lapse
Low Life with the loud raps, boy
You can't win, huh, I don't bend
Look what you got yourself in
Just usin' your name I took those L's
Hung 'em on your head and rocked your bells
Now, here we go, blow for blow, let's throw
Rhyme for rhyme, yours and mine, and yo
When it's time to battle rhyme I know
How to make it flow, so let's go
To the ring, rapper's sing and swing
Words and verse, see who deserves to be king
Serve a blow to that ego
As if you didn't know, let's go...

Let's Go!
Let's Go!

[Verse 4]
How can you say you're the best?
Get put to the test in front of a million and fess
Tried to withdraw because you saw
The juice I got's not like before
Huh, I'm formidable, unforgettable
You're submittable, you look pitiful
Yeah you're headstrong, but you're dead wrong
Wanna survive? Stick with the love songs
Take off your shirt, flex and flirt
And leave the real hard rhymes to the hard rhyme experts
If you don't, boy you'll get hurt
Feel like dirt and have to revert
To comin' on stage butt naked
To make up for what you can't do on record
Open your eyes twice the size and realise
I'm on the rise and you're on the demise
Ostracized by my reprise
Step in my face and watch how that head flies
I mean business and I'm serious
I ain't sellin' out and now here he is
Frontin' and fakin' and talkin' about makin'
The money from money, now don't you know they can
Use your support cos you've got caught
Signed, sealed, delivered, sold and bought
A puppet on a string with no heart
A fool and his money will always part
You used to be a rapper, turned into a businessman
Loafin' on the job and cheatin' the fans
I'm too potent, powerful and spiritual
Mental, emotional, physical and lyrical
You wanna beat me? It's gonna take a miracle
You've got a lock on my jock like a pitbull(Monster Crack)

1986 - return of the horror flicks
More deadly than "The Omen", a killer and a showman
Like the devil in "The Exorcist"
But this flick can cause a heart attack
Cause it's more than action-packed
It's alive and killing and the star is a villain
And his name is Monster Crack
The crack monster

He talks to ya like he's alive
And when he talks like bees to a hive
The people come running, the older and the young'in
The place he lives in is the house they hung in
He wants your money, only your money
He'll make you feel good for a real fast twenty
The bill is passed and the dollars go fast
The feeling is high but the high don't last
Long enough for you to even read a paper
But you still thirst and hunger for the vapor
Although he is inanimate, he'll make you feel
That he can breathe, think, talk and bleed for real
You should stay away cause all he's about
Is just making you broke and stringing you out
It only takes one kiss and a deep, deep breath
Then you're hooked for life cause it's the kiss of death

Like savoir-faire he's everywhere
He'll hook an innocent baby cause he don't care
He loves to eat, girls and boys, and he's nothing but poison
The biggest hit since Michael Jackson, he's making noise in
The streets he's notorious, to pushers he's glorious
To girls he's a pimp cause he turns em to the whoriest
Materialistic nymphomaniacs
That'll do anything for Monster Crack
Give away her body, steal from her brother
Fight her father or sell her mother
Cause when you're possessed by Crack, God bless
Your soul, cause he'll take the rest

The power of the mind should not be wasted
But the agony of defeat is always tasted
By those who chose to willingly oppose
Their mind like Toucan Sam instead they follow their nose
And the more you get, the more you want
You're killing your brain now, so later on it'll haunt
You you become insatiable, you can't get enough
When your money gets low, things really get rough
It's your only objective, you lose all perspective
On life, you're obsessed, possessed and defective
Losing weight and disappearing but still persevering
Your body tells you no, but all you're hearing
Is the crack talk

In South Africa many a brother died
Trying to fight back against apartheid
Bombs are flying, people are dying
Terrorists terrorizing and the whole world's trying
To prevent another war, but I got a surprise
There's already one right before your eyes
And we're nowhere near the end, this is only the beginning
Until this point the Crack has been winning
Weakening hearts, corrupting minds
A stone cold killer, very easy to find
And once he's caught by the law, he can't go to jail
Cause he's nothing but a little piece of matter for sale
Using people like pawns in the game of chess
And he is the king, more powerful than the rest

(Monster Crack
The crack monster)[Intro: Kool Moe Dee]

And yes y'all
The sounds that you hear
Is gonna be so real
You'll have no fear
Cause three live brothers are here
We got KRS-One from Boogie Down Productions
Special shout to Melodie
We got my man Chuck D in the house from Public Enemy
And I am Kool Moe Dee
So are you ready?

[ Verse 1: Kool Moe Dee ]
Are you ready, to elevate
As I rhyme on time you'll illuminate
Hard as diamond, knowledge shinin
It's that time and it's all in the timin
400 years blood, sweat and tears
The rain is over, and the sun is here
Yeah, bright and clear, countdown to the year
No fear, cause I'm in there
Holding my mic like the staff of Ra
Bringing true light after dark
Brothers are live, but still unborn
It's almost morn and it's time to mourn
See the light like a crack of dawn
The comatose and the cracked are reborn
Reurgitating the garbage we're fed
Cause this time dawn is dawn of the dead

[Hook]
Ain't that funky?
(Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky?
(Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky?
(Yeah, that's funky)

Rise and shine

Ain't that funky?
(Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky?
(Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky?
(Yeah, that's funky)

Get up

[Verse 2: Kool Moe Dee]
I rise and shine like the sun on the one
We dance together, we overcome
A wake-up call to wake up all
Stand up tall, get up and get up, y'all
Clap your hands in jubilation, meditation
Recreation, procreation of the mind
If you seek, we'll find
Born two times, but still one of a kind
Learn your past, find your path
The truth is infinite, like math
Countdown to the year two thousand
The thought alone is arousin'
When we see our way with the third eye
Rise with the sun and think with a bird's eye
View, as I watch our exodus
When the higher conscious connects it's just

[Variations of Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool Moe Dee]
The microphone is my funk receptor
When I speak on beat I'm trying to connect us
To what's left us messed up
Egos dressed up, got us effed up
You see onto instead of into
You see what you want to, instead of what you been through
You can take the rhyme I say
Read it, hear them, see them three ways
Combine the rhyme to any one of nine
For some still the light won't shine
You can take a shot in the dark, but keep missin'
You aim with one eye, you just don't listen
Cause see, in the dark you need all three
Your eyes are ears when you hear what you see
The five senses are all correlated
The sixth and seventh is how you elevate it

[Variations of Hook]

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
Ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
This a K-R-S with a different something
What, come in a dance and we come down for sing
This a KRS me say - go!
'Nuff slaveships come from Africa
Full of Africans, sold in America
Now you want me to call myself American
Even though America kill the African
Check it, white man is European
And black man is African
White man never say Euro-American
So why should the black man say Afro-American?
If the black man is American with a afro
Then the white man is American with a long nose
It should be Long-Nose-American for the white man, and
Jump around and move your bottom, what

[Variations of Hook]

[Verse 5: Chuck D]
Make no mistake, we don't shake or stutter
So heed the word of the brothers
Who makes a boy into a man
It's the job of another man
Who knows his role as a father
He bothers to give his son his soul
And pass it on, to never front
Cause papa don't raise no punks
Got to make it known and to pass it down
Yeah, sounds like a job for the brother man now
Got to help a mother for me, uh
Each one teach one, if you can't find one
Talk to the little ones
And you'll see they'll listen
To few while missin'
Peace, to rise and shine[Kool Moe Dee]
(Yeah) One two, one two
Party people in the place to be!

[Redman]
Yeah, ha ha
Let me clear my throat! {*2X*}
Gilla House niggas baby

[Kool Moe Dee]
We gon' get a lil' somethin straight here in the place to be

[Redman] + (Kool Moe Dee)
Yeah... yo
You now rockin with the best, I'm blessed
I deliver well, that's why I'm up in the S
UPS, through rain sleet or snow
I never break down, my skin made of Goretex
Heard Reggie went left, cause when I do right
Punk niggas out of spite only give me a few mics
Three best emcees, time for new light
Let the streets decide on how nice! (Let's rock the house)
You see to be an emcee is not money in the bank, or
Blowin niggas off like "Homey we are late!"
A million dollar boss dictatin what I think, shit
His shooter's gettin real nervous in the paint
Five star when I rank, like Le Armitage
Girls lookin like Nicki Minaj, Reggie
Hip-Hop I rock steady, just check my clout
When Jersey in the building, I (rock the house!)

[Hook: Redman] + (Kool Moe Dee)
Yo, you now rockin with the best, one of the best
Best believe boy I look so FRESSSH~!
Just tellin you how I feel
(We gon' get a lil' somethin straight here in the place to be)

[Redman] + (Kool Moe Dee)
Heheh, hey, they asked me how I maintain
The rap game and the streets I can picture in the same frame
You ain't raw? You don't ball
So lose yourself, tryin to keep UP when I change lanes
My weed game green, clientele is swell
It's Cool like LL
DeBarge look alike brother, time will reveal
That I'm doin it, and doin it well! (Let's rock the house)
Even if you read braille you can feel my swag
I'm your seein eye dog with the pen and the pad
Blue collar, when I talk, you can touch
So FUCK how much money you can fit in the bag!
My gift is the gab, the street's the truth
They got a lil' lost when down South came through
I stayed in the booth and began to trip
Cause (can't nobody rock like me, hah, remember this!)

And haters gon' say "He a funny ass nigga!"
But I'm a asset, good barbershop talk
The game without me is Wu-Tang without RZA
Pour out a little liquor how I murder it
Beef; my boys Fatburger it
Gilla - never heard of it? Shut your mouth
When Jersey in the building, I (rock the house!)

[Hook]

[Redman] + (Kool Moe Dee)
Yo, what you consider the best, what you invest
A half a mill' around your neck? Let me guess
Punchlines after punchline for a check
I did that, when GangStarr had to "Get a Rep"
My city in debt, that's why I sound hungry
My flow dumb as fuck like Al Bun-dy
Ask Treach, I do it for my lonely
All y'all come and get it if you want me (let's rock the house)
Man, I'm a funny ass niggaOmg can you belive this shit I can't but ol well I really should stop typing fast right becuse im pretty sure I mispelled aword all ready but I bet all you niggas think im young but im so your righht but I got got enogh cents to right thiss huh and make up these words and tpye this this fast but I guess not bye lol this boy is al tlk no bite so shut the eff up pls like rite n womow
