[Intro]
You be anything you want
Just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone
It don't stop here nigga

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got your name and your word so never break it
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it
Out selling P’s and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Roll that weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy be gettin' so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good cali bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
You known I’m fresh up off that corner, twistin marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we owners
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in the hall
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
All we do is get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it on
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa][Hook]
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
You know I’m reppin’ Taylor

Ain't fuckin with blunts, you know we only smokin’ paper
And I throw it up so that you know just what my name is
Muthafuck a hater

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
Left the crib with 10 grand bought a hundred pair
I’m the coach I can show you how to be a player
5/8 is the fitted, bitches love my hair
Camo shorts go with anything I wanna wear
They let me in the club, fuck a dress code
Me and all my niggas rollin up the best smoke
OG kush from the westcoast
Oh you down to fuck? Well shorty let's go
Diamonds in my chain, niggas trying to steal my lane
Chronic in my brain bitch, I’m reppin' Taylor Gang
Smoke till I’m insane, drinking til I’m throwing up
Only papers if you Taylor’d nigga throw it up
High socks, low cuts
Smell that good weed, then you know its us
That yellow car pulling up, them niggas ain't high so they close to us
Down to fly, yeah, two fingers and hold em up

[Hook]

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]
Bought a crib like Scarface’s
"This is my world"
All my niggas down to bang but we can try words
Smoking ounces to the head til my mind twirls
I’m the mayor and my bitch look like a fly girl
Topic of discussion talk shit cause they bitches love us
Plus them niggas suckas I got that in living color
All my cars are different colors, all my broads are different colors
All I do is fuck ‘em once, and I dont call or give ‘em numbers
Rolex, more sex, good weed, no stress
Run my town, arms, chest, lift weights, bowflex
Throw your set up, what you rep when you twistin’ ya fingers?
Real recognize real and my nig you a stranger
Got a bank full of scrilla, a brain full of papers
Got a phone full of hoes, and a gang full of Taylors

[Hook]

[Chevy Woods]
You see me out I rep my gang
Used serve that John McCain, that John McCain
Hold up they dont know my name?
Chevy who? Chevy who?
Look at all that shit them dollars do
Gettin’ all this money wit you know who
It’s Taylor Gang over you
We poppin bottles gang signs
All my niggas gang signs
Rollin up gang signs
Niggas trippin, bang time
Hold up, what they say bout us?
Same niggas gotta get the OK bout stuff
They ain't in the same league
They don’t play like us
No stems, no seeds, keep that rolled up
Bang on them hoes, we does that
Socket work, I just had a plug for that
Get your taylor on
Hold for whatever you rep
Throwin up the gang, 4800 still reppin a set
Got these niggas trippin’, and these bitches too
They just haters though, no matter what we do
What up cuz, on the left side
Its Taylor gang, and thats or die
CHEVY!

[Hook][Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
What you smoking, nigga ?
I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Word - pull up on the corner smoking herb
Nigga, you scared
So high you talking shit, but I don't hear it
Hey, hey, wow, church
I'm smoking that shit from the Earth
Riding, no shirt, pussy ass niggas do your homework
Ooh hey, word on the streets, Khalifa's a beast
Shit, 'bout to go D-Wade, hit 'em with the heat
Fuck with me, I'm the realest, realest, nigga, I'm the realest
Blowing on killer while I'm listen to Killa
Body full of tattoos like a killer
Ho, word on the streets that I got these niggas upset
All my niggas from the bottom, from the projects
I take a bitch home, give her long dick, that long dick
Yes, hit it then I quit it
And when I'm in it get the pussy so wet think I'm 'bout to go swimming
God damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga got cash, talking big cash, nigga blow kush, talking big bags
Niggas still hating on a nigga, hit the weed once, do the Wiz laugh
Got faded in a mug, god damn I'm tailored up
Got - papers in my lungs, got it straight from the plug
Got - what you smoking, nigga?

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
This a whole P, it ain't no seeds
But on the real I'mma probably need the whole tree
Can't fuck with you acting like the police
The way your bitch pop the pussy, had to go see
It ain't nothing for your girl like ho, please
Let you down to do a favor like you owe me
Soul Train diamonds dancing in this AP
Taylor Gang, pussy nigga, you don't know me
Droptops with some twins in it
Ha, what you doing, boy, I been did it
Yeah, roll up, let your friends hit it
Ha, around my city, boy, I been did it
Man, I can't even lie, y'all don't get high like that
In the ride like that with a ride like that
Cherry pound like that, but it's all in them raps
Stop lying to the people acting like you got the pack right now
[?] it's how you act a real round
Got a ticket on your head, let my homie hit the lotto
Big niggas, I don't fight it, see the boom or a bottle
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Helicopter too now, I'm a subject
Face on the news nigga, for the public
Gotta hide at my cousins at the projects
Smoking weed with the Crips in the complex
Twisting OG's with the Bloods in the commons
Cause only colour they see is green
And they're gonna do anything for the commas
TGOD, now they wanna call the feds
I'm a king smoking all this, all this grass
What you smoking on, nigga? That's a bag full of trash
I was in the 9th grade smoking weed after class
Just a tilt door looking like the car on fire
This the weed mix, you gon' need a few lighters
You ain't never smoke no fucking KK, nigga
And we don't smoke no motherfucking AK, nigga
Word on the street buy whole one
Get good with the plug, you gon' throw one
Serve your homie who ain't never gon' say shit
Chef it up in the face like a shogun

[Hook][Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
All my niggas is day ones
I only fuck with A1's
You niggas know what the gang is
We young black and dangerous
Still down with my day one niggas, hell yeah I'm still down
Still down with the shit
Still down with my A1 niggas, hell yeah I'm still down
Still down, still down

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, they can't believe I'm still here
Made a million dollars but I wouldn't replace it for nothin'
A lotta niggas been killed here
I done seen niggas get they whole shit blown off in public
A lotta blood, sweat, and hope came from this block
When floodin', a lotta dope came from this block
But fuck it, I'm in my whip pushing buttons
I think about the ones that dead and gone and ones that still thuggin'
Uh, and they still down
Got no love for them pussy ass motherfuckers, cause they still clowns
Smokin real pounds, just bought a real home
Me and my watch, both real stoned
Pour some gin, man it's all about the m's
New Ferrari or a Benz, get a joint and hold it in
And I been with the same niggas since they was hitting licks
And yeah they still with the shits

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
(Yeah, Taylor Gang, Chevy)
Yo, tell them niggas we nothin' alike
They see us and imitate what they want to be like
What's hand and hand to them J's next day on the flight
Shit, where I'm from if you're out too late then you're playing with your life
Bet they feel how I feel, dinner out in brazil
My day ones'll see about you for me for real
And the finest of fashion, makin' a statement
Who thought it used to take me to get it now anything we can afford it
Hate us so much that I'm cakin', I ain't mad at them at all
Just know about this dough, don't make or make you a John
Huh, the same ones that been A1's
A few niggas gone act different when that change come
Yeah, horsepower from that kitchen vision
It's Taylor Gang, when you they ask you tell them we the business
Them niggas tryna copy us, they lookin' stupid
Swear, dressing all crazy, boy you look like a build-a-bear

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Still down, down, down, down, down
All day err'day I come around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
We stay down, down, down, down, down
All day err'day they say we wouldn't make it
It's just me and my niggas, just me and my niggas

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign][Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Thousand pounds of weed
Ridin' in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed
Them hoes dont use they feet no more, they break down to their knees
And suck me like a king
Rosé in my champagne glass and diamonds in my ring
Uh, roll some, thats your bitch on my dick
I might let her hold something
You niggas smoking sevens I'mma need a whole onion, whole youngin, oh
Same ones that hate, same ones that tag along
No Blackberry, too many lame niggas call my phone
Call me world wide Wiz cause I’m never home
Ever leave me round your bitch I’mma get her stoned
And you know that I rock camos and brought fros back
And go download some of my old track
And go play somewhere there’s hoes at
Fucking high, and you down there where them lows at
Gettin tired of hearing my flow jacked
Go head hand me a joint, you can't roll that

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I got a whole lot of OGs, and
I’m rolling up for anyone in here that knows me
Everybody smoking, yea it's a party, oh, its a party
Everybody smoking papers, nobody smoking blunts
Bitches rolling weed and my niggas fucked up
Yea it's a party, oh, it's a party

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Quarter pound of that sour, thats four days on tour
Sleeping on how we smoke, see all these pillows on this floor
Every state we score, fill those papers they be raw
Look like a piece of chalk in my hand
But I ain't writing on the chalkboard
And I heard its a party, its a party its a party but I’m cool
Them niggas smoking garbage, I’m no fool
We give 5 j’s out half zips? Nigga thats really smoking
Ain't enough weed up in that swisha to get you high, you joking
Niggas claim that they be high, they be hella low
When they gang up in the building you gon’ smell that sour smoke
I could get that shit from my backyard, go pick it out myself
Yellow light let me slow it down, niggas need some help
28 ain't enough you need more
All this weed over here, thats 1 weed jar
When them planes get the flying, niggas wanna part
Smoking crash with the plane, Amelia Earhart

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Neako]
What I smoke in one day, these niggas dont smoke in one week
Riding round and its just me, Pepsi can, playing that Bun B
Gotta smoke that dope on the run with me, comfortably, I’m smoking weed
Doing speeds, who with me, probably a chick from TMZ
I make her roll like two or three, let her smoke and feel the breeze
Ya’ll chip in on a half a zip, counting grams, saving weed
Average shit, it was us just smoking out in NY
Swear to GOD we let ten fly, thats ten planes with ten guys
Nine smoke, meaning someone left without his mind pot
Planes Continental, flights nonstop
You get some zips, well get some P’s
Smoke your spliffs around your bitch, tell me how does she breath
Perfect planes, we call them G6′s
And its just me chilling, me and three bitches
Rolling up its cool, come take this bong rip
Pack this bold straight dope, make your lungs rip[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
First of all, my dog, back off
Ash Roth top five right now, better know that
But rap without me is like braidless Moesha, Kobe with no Shaq
But when I'm on the mic all I get is blank stares
No cares, it's a slow clap
But just because you rapping like "Da-da-da-da-da-da"
Doesn't mean you really rap
I can't grasp how these broke asses claiming to be rich
But really get no cash
I been to your whack show, what you call that, bro?
25 people at home with a cat?
You go posting like "Yo it was packed, it was dope
It was girls from the front to the back"
All these cum rags keep comparing white rappers with Asher
But everybody knows I'm the dad
For the craft, or a laugh, not a tad outlasted
I don't really care what you say
10 years from now I'ma still love college
While I'm fucking white girls out in Arizona State
I'm sick of hearing all the hoes you be having
How much dro you be smoking, homie no you don't
You showed up with bros
Here's a RAW paper, do you even know how to roll?
Let it go like my hair length
I'm gonna quit rap start it better I'm gonna play bass guitar
Me, Chevy, Chip, and Dumbfounded
What should we call it?
Hmm, How about RAW?

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I been wakin' up everyday, doing the fuck I want
All I need is for shit to be cool, and pass that fuckin' blunt
Nigga never gave no fuck about police, I piss all on their grave
Justice for Mike Brown, you son of a bitches gon' be held to pay
I got the severed hands of 100 cops up out my chariot
What if every hood united? That would be some scary shit
Way more niggas than cops
You too sure nigga how to do anything
3D print my SK, walk in TSA, couldn’t say anything
I walked in like a real one, ready to kill somethin'
Its impossible to hear my voice, and not feel nothin'
Suck a black dick, Bill O'Reilly fuck you
I'm King Chip I say exactly what I want to
Nigga never gave no fuck ‘bout politics, I got the power, bitch
4 bedroom house, in my living room I got a lot of chicks
Smokin’ fool… Nigga, we smokin' fools
How does it feel to be wearing a chain that's way more dope than you?

[Verse 3: $kinny]
I be that same nigga with a whole lot of jewels, whole lot of hoes, whole lot of O’s, blow whole lot of O’s, whole lot of guns blow whole lot of holes, home full of holes, whole full of fuck yous, whole lot of crews that’ll ride for me, die for me, pry for me, rob for me, probably get caught by the cops for me, cop drops for niggas that’ll lie for me. And if you wanna pop off let it pop off. In a benz with the top off with some drop offs. In the tint it’ll be hotboxed you’ll be hot sauce with some twins in the lunchbox full of pot roast. ????
I be up in cairo with the pharaohs
I be up in cabo with dineros
On the beach with a barrel full of arrows
Y'all can't bang with us hang with us
Bunch of fuckin' traderers, strangerers
Never see me paperless, I’m angel dust
Dope boy straight dangerous, irregulars
I’m the same nigga you love to hate
Must be the bands i make
Must be the pounds i make
Must be the way i bang LA
Must be the whip i brought around the town today
Must be the bitch i flew in outta town today
Must be the shit i blew up in the Mandalay better do what the camel say
Few goons from France saint tropez. Haters go scramblé

[Verse 4: Chevy Woods]
Young dope sellin' nigga
4800 got the coke sellin' nigga
Now all these wannabe friends see us real now they wanna try and coattail a nigga, but
Ha.. look I ain't for it, dodge on them niggas nah this ain't ford
211 when they run it back to me now that’s what I call a raw report
That Honda accord, three chickens in a wheel well
Lil nigga when it come to that kitchen you know I know that shit real well
Yea, say hi to me, the nigga who they sayin' wouldn't be shit
Oh, look and I'm Randy Savage ?? Yo bitch want the beef stick
That’s cold, see this watch here cost a new home
Look baby I’m ballin' watch these shooters get you outta that zone
You talkin' like you gettin' to the money, you ain't gettin' to the money pussy leave me alone
Ha…. Ha…
And I never keep shit at my home
Niggas always talkin' that killa shit but they don’t know no motherfuckin' killas
They say I always rap about drug sellin' cuz I was out on that corner with the dealers
You see I’m doin' this so I’m ain't gotta go back to that book bag full of that work
And a pussy ass nigga tried to set me up same pussy ass nigga that got merked
If you bang that shit, nigga claim that shit, see me I don’t fuck with that side, try me better look out your window I have them niggas waitin' in that car parked outside
I ain't ever get no money with you broke ass niggas, never told y'all who’s the connect
Ima always be 4800 nigga real shit homies on the set
Shoes off, champagne, steak well done not the crib this is all on a jet
They don’t wanna give it to me imma take my shit either way imma get my respect
Free all my niggas that’s locked in the cage when they touch down they gon' see
And tell them pussy ass niggas don’t copy my shit and you know that’s TGOD fuck nigga
Oooohhhh!![Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah nigga, I only fuck with a certain type of niggas man
One hundred, ayy Drew put some delay on my voice
Put some reverb on there and turn me up, uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas got it fucked up
Probably thinking its a game
I might smile a lot
But I ain't playing with 'em
I'm up at eight, I work all night
I'm rolling weed, I'm on the flight
Soon as I land I'm gonna write
I'm on the grind
40 hours, 2 shows, 3 planes, 6 zeros
Flying all around the world
Like I'm a fucking hero
Pouring it straight out a bottle
That's how we drink Cliquot
And we all from the same hood
That's why we feel the same thing
Like say if one of our pockets hurting
We all gon' feel the same pain
Always smoking out the car service
Police escorting, not at all nervous
We the bomb, search us
Penthouse, whole room filled with cash in it
Old school backseat, with the stash in it
Big joint, OG mixed with hash in it
And it's TGOD, you niggas last minute
Your flow last year, the swag last fall
You just the last place, you ain't gon' last at all

[Hook]
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
You know its Taylor Gang or die
Haha, word

Ah, fresh out the spot where they selling
You gotta pay 'em to cook
Ain't no rules out this motherfucker
Who sold you that book
Bitch we down when its cracking
Around my way and you know that
Can get more than I ever asked
So be afraid of the go back
Hear them talking, I'm cool and moving
No cameras, respect the shooters
I'm out on this money train
You don't know about hustle, do you?
It's everything in or nothing
Bitch you know how I get down
You wasn't mad at me before
So why is you mad at me now?
The alcohol got you talking
You do the same thing, and the cops
Know conversation, know where we playing
Only for money calls only
That mean I can't deal with them old games
That you trynna kick, this ain't Shinobi
I told her baby you thirsty
She responded I'm cool
Said your wrist, its got water
I told her bitch this a pool
Feel me gang that, or concrete dive head first
But if you owe me money, I need my bread first

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Berner]
What you smoking on man? Aha
What you got in your bag though bruh?

The same shit, new bitch with me
Buy 20, run through 50
I'm running through the stop lights, late night
I told baby girl get your cake right
That kush doesn't taste right
You take it to the head
All you smell is cake, K, and cookie smoke in the Benz
Where my roof go, I stack up quick, while they move slow
White girls in my room, I'm smoking while they do blow
Plush life, no crushed ice
I'm 20k in the game, my bookie loves life
But fuck it, I like to blow cash
I don't tuck it, its nothing
Two first class flights to the function
20 zans, 120 grand, in the city where the pretty girls dance
And them plants grow, in the warehouse
Skinny cash, if you pass me bullshit, I'mma laugh
I'm the man, no lie baby

[Hook]Oh, they said they don’t fight like this no more

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, gloves on, then I beat it up

You gon get it later off on how you actin’ now
I’mma put my gloves on and play Pacquiao
That king-size bed, that’s the boxing ring
Oh, we gon fight, I’m just waitin’ for the bell to ding
I’m the champ baby girl, you ain’t gotta ask
And the bedroom’s sponsored by Everlast
I promoted this myself, call me Don King
I had you floatin’ like the butterfly, Ali
Call esthetics, speed bed
Straight down the middle girl, I got a mean jab
Mayweather fast or Butterbing slow
Uppercuts, right hooks and watch our knees go
Oh, the ref don’t wanna stop the fight
I’mma play Michael Tyce, let me knock you out tonight
Difference is , I’m getting weeded up
Taking my gloves off after I beat it up

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, gloves on, then I beat it up

He was talkin’ all that shit when we was weighing in
I got the contract, I just need a pen
And the physical to show me what your body like
In the interview I said you goin’ down tonight
They said what round, I said I don’t know
I’m just down to let the girl give me low blows
Cause ima have her cornered, throwing in the towel
Trained a little harder, I went the extra mile
24/7, like it’s HBO
I throw my robe on and now I’m good to go
Fireworks going off, walk into the ring
It’s the main event, our faces on the screen
That’s Rocky, Apollo, need that water bottle
Between rounds it’s models, docks S-in if you follow
You want a re-match, you gon need a lawyer
Cuz I’m the golden boy bitch, Dela Hoya

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up

Baby wanna spar, she don’t get enough
Put my gloves on, then I beat it up
12 rounds, beat it up, 12 rounds, beat it up
12 rounds, gloves on, then I beat it upIntro:

Have these workers cookin’ like it’s dinner then these numbers fly
Let these numbers grow, in a drop numbers gon blow
Get this shit, I got it, go sell
Give her titties, smokers want mo’
Nigga got that fire, propane
All white like daddy, cocaine
When the man say snow, no rain
I make bread like dough, no thing
This shit gon fly, no plane
My only trap here, no stains
On full time post, no game
All about cash money like Wayne
If you ain’t heard, I’m a trapper panic with naked flips
Something like Jason Statham in Transporter with taken trips
They see the AB in our Taylor Gang
Bitch it’s gon be murder if one of these snitchin’ niggas go to meet the cops

We gettin’ money over here, fuck is y’all yellin’?
Countin’ up the paper from them whole pack sellin’

Gettin’ money out here, wippin’ 36
Gettin’ 36, bitchin’ 36
Shaquille O’Neal, that’s a 36
For Boston though, ask the Celtics
David Garrard, Bru Breeze
Times 2, you know what that means

No guns, it’s lunch time
Niggas gotta eat, I gotta see my chips
That’s why I flip a 36

It’s a million niggas like us too
Uh, let’s go

Young nigga from the hood, got his whole chest open
So that tell you that it’s more than weed that this nigga smokin’
Livin’ the fast life and the cold game
All he know is money, bitches, weed and cocaine
What a life, right?
45 when he sleepin’ but a night life
Just a lost soul cruisin’ through that night life
Family turned on him but he blamed his self
For the shit that they ain’t do, they know he needed help
Got him outside, with his mask on
45, same one to get his cash on
In the presence of other niggas don’t stop, let’s focus
Who could he turn to, Shitty knew that he was hopeless
Just the pressure make you wanna kill
You don’t ever know how that shit feel

They telling that they loving but they don’t accept it
I just wanna ask some questions, can we be real for a second?

Let’s just be real be real be real..
Let’s just be real be real be real..
Let’s just be real be real be real..
For a second let’s just be real be real be real..

Gunshots go off and he don’t even budge
And Pac said it the best cuz Shorty wanna be a thug
Actin’ blind to the fact so they never pay attention
He say he don’t care, he just gon get juvenile detention
That’s fucked up, yea he cool with the crossroad
He stuck on it up just cuz his watch was cold
Nowhere to go, walls closin’ in
I tried to school him, he told me you gotta lose or win
I said you know what Shorty? You fuckin’ right
Same night, young’un lost his life

They telling that they loving but they don’t accept it
I just wanna ask some questions, can we be real for a second?

Let’s just be real be real be real..
Let’s just be real be real be real..
Let’s just be real be real be real..
For a second let’s just be real be real be real..

Let’s just be real be real be real..
Let’s just be real be real be real..
Let’s just be real be real be real..
For a second let’s just be real be real be real..[Hook]

Finger press a mother fucker nigga never fondle

Don't know what you tripping for, get your walk and your stride straight

You do what you can sucka I do what I wanna do:Smoke and kick fly shit
Niggas scared of change so they ain't getting no money
They just staying the same, ain't giving themselves options
In life, just cool with their situation
Roll it up, count it after I make it
I paid the cost, to keep it G'er than ever a real nigga
These my cards, they gotta deal with ya
I just kick back, write several ill raps
Count it all roll it up and that's that
Feel me? Cold items placed on my fingers and wrist
I'm just cool so, would you chill please? Uhh

All the 100 dollars spent you know
You never been so I guess not
They sleepin on a nigga like truckers at truck stops
From a dollar so I guess this what the buck stops
Pull up like hmmm I need it off the car lot
My diamonds say a lot I don't talk too much
The wide face big sort of like hockey puck
What up full gang a couple cool chains
TGOD that's how I do thangs

[Hook]
You know you rock it with the best little mama
Them other niggas they cool
Until I pull up the sucka players suck em from the Taylors
And they like uuh, layy
Until a green light, that's the only way I go
Baby you welcome to the cook out
That's if you wanna go ya

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm just drinkin creeping
Smoking while I'm rapping bitch
That's cheifin' while I'm speaking in the deep end
Got my feet in
Plus all my niggas stacking don't know what you niggas thinking
Brought a couple friends I brought a couple friends so you should meet them
You tired I got some pajamas for you to sleep in
I'm rockin Balenciaga the models all give me proper's
In fashion niggas say I'm light years passing niggas
Who wanna grind who got it locked
Go ahead and ask these niggas who want my shine
I'm way too boojie for these nasty niggas
I'm rolling up my trees and passed the weed right past these niggas
Cause you got all your moves from me but you ain't ask me nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
Don't spill my liquor bitch
They got a cold I'll be on some sicker shit
Like bless you niggas who hated on me

Tryin something yeah you would get a hollow head
Let the town talk Chevy get a lot of bread
I'm really bout it and you just playing games
My niggas got a lot of years and they ain't sayin names
I just pull up on some Taylor shit
Gator shit old school player shit
Just to look in your eye you on some hater shit
Cause I'm on my grind on some Big Jerm skater shit

[Verse 1: Berner]
Head so good I got my eyes close
I'ma go raw and let the dice roll
35 hundred for the smoke bag

I'm probably in an old school, weed lit
Candy paint on them chrome shoes (chrome shoes)
12 Packs, 35 Stacks
Mixed Xan with the Gin that's why I didn't call back
Strong pack, city on my ball cap
Thirty round drummer make a hater wanna fall back
Boss shit, me I let my bread talk
Fed high, they want me in the cell locked
Two bitches on my dick yeah I love freaks
Bitches cash out just to fuck me
And she ain't even gotta speak
I laid her on the couch and I beat
She a certified freak

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Rolling up cookie, pouring up sizzurp
Bad yellow bitch with my hand up her skizzert
Let my seat back and the ho gonna slizzurp
She do it too good I can't be a [?]
Do it so good I'ma put that chick to work
Put her in the strip club let the bitch twerk
The money ain't straight then she gone get hurt
I won't save no ho, I ain't no church (Never!)
Juicy J pimping shit that's all a nigga know
Weed be so loud that's all a nigga smoke (you know it)

Keep the ho, keep the ho
She ain't giving up the head you can keep the ho

[Hook x2]

[verse 3: Chevy Woods]
I pulled my socks up and made some popcorn
Trying to sauce on your chicken and that's hot sauce
She dancing like she wanna have a nigga baby
Word to my nigga Berner told the bitch [?]
There is only reason for this phone call
Turn some PitBull on and she get lockjaw
I'm on some Taylor shit, kicks with the gator print
Say you getting all this money nigga what you make of it
I'm balling like a mother fucker, Dennis Rod
She on the 9 to 5 and that's on her job
Tilt your head back, take a shot of this
I'm on my sixth man, like I'm off the bench
While the club going dumb that's your baby father
Tell him I'm just trying to function word to 40 water
All these bottles and this bitch you's a wanna be
But let me get back to what shortie doing in front of me
Aye, aye, aye, aye[Hook: Chevy Woods]
All my niggas still getting money, okay
Still be in the whole ain't no damn thang changed
When We first met you I ain’t had too much to say
Now we in this club and you all up in my face
Cuz you came in here to make the make off with champagne wishes (x4)

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
New car when I pull up
Looking for some type of way my nigga pull up
They always talk about it, but do nothing
We got the whole club, my nigga do something
I'm talking all these bottles, I been trapped out with it
Cash out money, man plan lets get it
Man you can't talk about it if you ain't really with it
Had feelings on my mind, ton of shit I'm living
All this mothafucking high fashion on me
Gonna be tripping when we in here, slowly
Can't afford it when it come to action, on me
Keep cool, when the nigga around him, OG's
Baby heard you ready for the fight night
Kevin hart in that pussy go night night
Anything after this, that's what I like
And your girlfriend too, that's the highlight
She just wanna know where her Taylor (x2)
Tell em broke ass niggas, no I can't do them boys no fucking favors
Then we be fucking, we crashing on wall, we waking up neighbors
They hate on a nigga cuz I'm not here counting up all this paper, ya know it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm a shooting star, go ahead and make a wish
If ya ain't talking about no money, you ain't talking shit
Bad bitches, asking me to take a pick
We snap up, leave the club, then we make a flick
That's the shit my nigga don't babysit
Yellow diamonds looking like baby piss
Shawty pussy so wet I'ma take a dip
Smoking lettuce while I'm counting my chips
100 thousand dollars, nigga that's a paycheck
100 ace bottles, nigga that's a taste test
Parking lot at the crib and its looking like a race track
Shawty, she can't roll, unless her pussy waxed

[Hook]Just make sure my pinky ring clean, bitch!

[Verse 1]

Oh, I kick game like Ronaldo, that’s my goal
No script for some pimp shit, nigger that’s my role
So if the dice shows seven, that’s my point
And if I roll eleven, then I roll a joint!
Pimp shit, door cracking watch my shoe's show
They hit a button by the wheel and watch the roof go
Boss shit, I be on my Hugo
We all getting to this money, don’t care who go
Big plates, I like my shit well done
Thanks for giving me nothing, you’re all welcome!
I made mine started from the bottom up
I mean all this cash from a dollar up!
What? that’s paper like a print machine
See me cruising through the city in that tint machine
You know I ride regular no regular
Dot after dot after dot, etcetera

[Hook]

That’s your girl, she got a battery in her back
You should learn how to control her
Cause one night with the taylors you think you’d get her back
Homie no sir, we gonna have a good time, good time , good time, good time, good time
That’s what I show her! (oh, oh, oh, oh)
We’re in the back riding, chauffeur!

[Verse 2]

Remember we wasn’t getting it, now we’re getting it all
Stand on top of my work nigga i’m on my job
Same nigga i’ve been, throwing that alley-oop
From the corner to the world racing on rally coupe
Lee roy, shown of, couple papers roll up
Hit the clutch and spin the wheel, when I do a donut
My best physical year, my birth stones
And a cheer  take a trick and give her back after I get mine yeah!
Homie, that’s cold game  I learned
That from some players with Them whole things
Four finger rings and Them gold chains
Pimping like a mother fucker suppose to
Tell me who you’re supposed to be huh
Dressing up like somebody you’re not  suit on I’m like broke
Pimping in the spot, chuch I see who you wanna be
Change the channel your girlfriend a tv!

[Hook]

That’s your girl, she got a battery in her back
You should learn how to control her
Cause one night with the taylors you think you’d get her back
Homie no sir, we gonna have a good time, good time , good time, good time, good time
That’s what I show her! (oh, oh, oh, oh)
We’re in the back riding, chauffeur![Wiz Khalifa]
Big house, four whips, hella tattoos
Smoke good and your bitch think I’m bad news
Bout to go nuts nigga, cashews
Promoter asked me if I’m booked

Maserati look mean and it’s fast too
Cinderella bout to get that bitch some glass shoes
Niggas acting mushy like cat food
Niggas acting pussy like cats do
Get a little money nigga, that's cool
But put your niggas on, then you really that dude
Smoking two Ls, living large
See my watch and wanna know how much it really cost
AP that’s an Audemars
Agents calling bitch I’m balling like I’m Stoudemire
Store running out of papers cause I bought em all
Niggas claiming that they Taylors but they not at all
Not far from the tree thats where the apple fall
Say the wrong words, guys knock your apple off
No sweetener straight apple sauce
Doing movie roles, rapper slash actor dog
I’m not a star, somebody lied
I’m rolling weed up in my car
And getting high
If I die today, remember me like Jimi Hendrix
Butt-ass naked covered in all bad bitches

[Chevy Woods]
Chevy
I’m praying for you niggas
I put that on my Rosary
Flash like diamonds, tell me what you tryna see
Us high beams, this just a pinky though
Washing machine work, I keep a couple loads
Foreign bitch, she don’t even talk
She just drop the money off and got a sexy walk
365, no days off
Shit I’m the reason they say hard work pays off
Twenty-eight to fifty-six is what I learn first
Parks Bonifay, you see just how that work surf
Oh I’m some big shit, Notorious
Get you some gunplay basterd inglourious
I got the top chopped off riding Ichobad
Head riding shotgun, oh that's your broad
Bright lights, dead Charley
Ignorant white, Bill O'Reilly

[Neako]
I’m kinda high
They looking for me, I was probably in the sky
I’m always fried when I hop in that double S
I can be there in a minute
Pepsi blue, I’m the ice cube riding in it
Lightly tinted, I be ghost
Blowing smoke, calling them bitches up
Dick em down when I pick em up
Never keep em close
Hit em and then I switch em up
Audemars bruh, Wizzles riding in Pick up trucks
Riding puff bus, tough luck you dumb fucks
Never came up, while we riding on planes bruh
Yeah we counting hundreds
A lot of hundreds, these niggas know that we run it
We never blunted
Smoking them raws cause we raw
Never flaw, fly as you ever saw
Real life we riding real cars
Hustle hard for muscle cars
Fuck the best broads
Blowing O’s at all cost
Natural born stars, what they saying, yeah

[Wiz Khalifa]
Taylor Gang Or Die
WizzleI don’t really gotta say it but uh
Real shit
You know, some of the shit I’d say, you niggas wouldn’t believe it
I mean, if I showed you in your face, you wouldn’t believe it
Me and my niggas been gettin’ to this money
This really ain’t nothin’ new

Get into this money, still perfecting the flow
You see me, I’m a G, you got a couple letters to go
Went from cookin’ and rockin’ it up, to dope with the stamps on the pack
Was gettin’ so much of it, thought it couldn’t get better than that
Threw on my boots and coat, had that work in the cold
And never did I do business with any niggas who told
My niggas live by the code, we ain’t seen it or heard it
When you talkin’ ‘bout money you gotta know how to word it
Been on the road for a while, them sacrifices, I made ‘em
Oh, you don’t see what I’m doin’, I guess your vision is jaded
Gotta get it and save it, stack it up and invest it
Well I come from the jungle and all my niggas, they restless
Wouldn’t change it for shit at all, like who need a court to ball?
That Ray told me time is money, I put this verse on my dog
And put it out on my gang, cuz yea, they my niggas fo’ sure
Fuck them niggas hatin’ cuz we don’t do this shit fo’ show

(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
Yea nigga, fuck these niggas know about your dad bein’ gone, nigga?
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
Fuck you niggas know about that?
Fuck you niggas know about?
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
The same shit you sellin’ is the same shit your uncle overdosed on, nigga
It’s real shit, 4800, I’m from the jungle for real my nigga
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)

I swear this shit ain’t made up, at night weighing that weight up
Moms ain’t know I was bakin’, I was tryna get my cake up
Yea, them old niggas, they had cars that I wanted
And I ain’t need advice, I just need to get up on it
I befriended a couple niggas just off of the cool
But had to separate cuz they ain’t move, I move
I’m feet first to the pavement and my niggas know that
And I can’t lie, I had dreams of the go back
But what example would I be settin’ for all who follow?
When that pain set, I’m in need of that bottle
Damn, a lot of shit hurt me just the same
I’m just speakin’ for my niggas cuz they feel the same
Yea, that money callin’ and I’m pickin’ up
I gotta do this, business bruh so I don’t give a fuck
If you mad at me, what the fuck you think?
I just got it full by mines, I just got to be

(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
That’s real shit man
Fuck you niggas know about?
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
Dirty ass bitch playin’ both sides
You know what I’m sayin’?
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
Aye, your cousin got caught up in some bullshit
(Ain't wanna do wrong, but do to them circumstances I had to hustle)
And he the only family you know
The fuck you know about that?
