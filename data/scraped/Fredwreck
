And to my niggas incarcerated and on probation
I'mma stay bangin for the whole G Nation, nigga

[Hook]

[Mack 10]
It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G

And while I'm servin up and comin young hustlas and gluckas
Bangin for the hood causin havoc and ruckus
You niggas at the label kissin ass like suckas
And you're bitches so sit down when you piss mutherfuckas

[Ice Cube]
One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno (you know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation

You like a stick pussy, nigga? - you're useless
You know the side bitch, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin on it

[Mack 10]
Look check this shit out man

Sup Fred?
Gangsta shit
West Coast...

[Verse One]

Niggas with hepatitis
Unauthorized hard-to-move arthritis
Infected selected neglected ejected
And next time ya hit the West
You could best believe, believe the best, mothaFUCK the rest
What you supposed to be snatchin'?
You comin' to a world of punctured hearts and jackin'
Lethal illegal overseein' the overview like seagulls
Balls in ya jaws on the hunt like bald eagles
The end of the sequel
I'm the milli-mac and the strong-end and nigga to blame you
And I'mma start callin' ya'll bitch niggas by name:
Mothafuck D, Mothafuck M, only X I know is Xzibit or RBX, extraordinary
Trying to snatch my bitch, you can have the bitch, two bitches gettin' rich
Just to come to the West Coast and get stripped down
Beat to death and stripped, all over a bitch
Now it's 50 MC's that ain't worth shit
Get ya ass kicked 50 times, beat to 10 cent
I love New York, but the niggas that represent, ya'll ain't shit New York
They actin' like a bitch New York
Buckshot, Noreaga, Jigga - cool
Canibus, Wu-Tang, my niggas - cool
Def Squad and DefJam, but fuck Ja Rule
Irv Gotti I can't wait for Raekwon to break fool
Trynna sign Daz, nigga Daz 'll sign you
And when you hit the West, this is what we gon' do:
Get ya'll niggas, slap ya'll niggas like bitches
Dippin' through the 'hood on switches
I just bought me a Cadillac last week
Wit' a new bitch since my old bitch tweaked
Naw homeboy, the game just ain't the same
If you wanna know, Kurupt said it, and I'm Callin' Out Names

[Break]

*scratching* "Never did like him"
"You know what?" *scratching* "Fuck, fuck, fuck all ya'll"

[Hook: Kurupt, (Xzibit), [Dr. Dre]]

"It's for my niggas and my bitches
My bitches and all my niggas, my niggas and

Callin' Out Names!

Kurupt said it mothafucka from beginnin' to end
You salamander-ass caterpillar-ass mothafucka
Fake-ass busta-ass fake killa mothafucka
If it wasn't for the West
These rap niggas wouldn't need a vest for they chest
Quoted from a fucka homie X
The Lox ya'll my mothafuckas, can't forget ya'll
And that's spoken on from the mothafuckin Dogg
All the rest of ya'll, tell ya like this
Eat a fat dick bitch

[Break]

Fuck Ruff Ryder
Fuck The Firm
Fuck Belly

Kurupt says fuck 'em

[Hook]

Nigga, now if I didn't say yo name, then this ain't for you
But if you try to speak then I'mma peel the paint for you
I cause brain tumors, thinkin' of a thought to think
Lettin' off caliber's 'til the chamber need to be changed
Empty out, simply don't tempt me
I empty out until everything in this mothafucka's gone
I empty house off of empty rounds
Now what the fuck you gotta say?
What the fuck you wanna see? The homie's or my K
I never worry 'bout none of ya'll so why now?
I run it through and this is how you do it Dogg Pound (ROOF!)
The Gang, we master blast and maintain
Weed money cocaine got us all insane
Bitch niggas remember even though the times may change
I want Kurupt said it nigga, and I'm Callin' Out Names

They say this ain't the way to get rich!
I might as well pimp me a bitch!

Cause I just don't care, live from "G" square
Where the best Indica get put in the air
Nigga... fuck a bitch and fuck you too
What a punk mothafucka like you gon' do?

All you to want do
Do what the fuck you want to do too
Get what ya got to get to get through
Light what ya wanna light to light fire
Big arsonist blew to white fire
Blast through ya home or blast to hit doors
Crap like the crap table, Kane and Abel

Punk mothafucka, mothafuck, mothafucka, yeah nigga

[50 Cent]
You heard about the kid, you know how I rock
Went from pumpin bags on the block, straight to the top
So the money ain't a thing now, yeah that's right
Mansion after mansion, next stop the Hamptons
I splurge with it, I'm so absurd with it
Got the hunger to go get it, cause I wan' go spend it
You know how a boss player play, nigga I'm ballin
If there's money to be made, I'm all in
Catch me in a cherry red Porsche, beige seats, red pipin
You want me to teach you how to stunt, aight then
Tattoos on the arm, 30 karats on the charm
Cause the flow be the bomb, learn to respect the Don
First night if I don't hit, second night I want some shit
Third night we call it quits, I ain't fuckin with the bitch
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Another move another mill', let's get right - aight?

[Hook]

[Havoc]
You could, catch me cockin the fifth, got me rockin with Fif'
Now that's why you see the keys to the Bent'
Got my niggas movin the bricks, it don't stop
And a million dollar deal, homey get that gwap
See dudes get comfy, money ain't long enough
Come spit one verse, my whole crib's coughed up
Ma I got a fetish, fuckin in them Porsche trucks
Curtis got one so when I finished I tossed her
Y'all into wifin, we don't condone lifin
Only fuck with bitches that, got they liquor license
Shop high prices, shook all vices
Infamous nigga got the game in a vice grip
Chain hundred K but the flow, is priceless
Anything less? We rollin them dices
Nuts in the sand if you ain't bumpin my shit
Shorty wanna rip to my sound and my likeness

[Hook]

[Prodigy]
Listen - you can call me Gambino P or V.I.P
My wrists could buy a bitch a Ph.D
My rings alone could pay for you to eat
For the next few years I'm so icy kid
My flow is long money, my face is Hollywood
My tattoos gon' keep me with a thug part though
My attitude is universal, get harmed - call money
When we get back to Queens we gon' hurt you
Can't afford to ride, you gettin stomped out
I got a team of dimes, they all thonged out
Ready to line you up and take you out
My girls is hot man, they hard to turn down
You pee in your drawers lookin like you're Mexican
After lil' shorty wop wop break you off a lil' bit
You so stupid, we so much rich
And who braggin? I'm just tryin holla at the chicks like

[Hook]

Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong of me
I'mma stay down, you see me on them corners G
At your local liquor store, gettin some optimums
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real no.. the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
And when you walkin on my side I think you all need to know...

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block
In the seven deuce Coupe, hoppin hippin the hop
Sippin on some Henn with my nephew Infrared
Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like ooohhh-la-la
Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do-da-da
Yeah nigga we shakin the cops
You niggas out there just be makin it hot

Without gettin banged on.. brother you're wrong

[Break: Nate Dogg]
(Always up to no good!) I really love my dog, grew up together and all but he

[Hook] w/ the phrase "Always up to no good!" at the beginning of each line[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Let's get it!
Fredwreck, Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, Tech N9ne, and Mister Jim Morrison

[Hook: Jim Morrison & Tech N9ne]
Strange days have found us
(I been a nobody, but now I get it in)
Strange days have tracked us down
(Nowhere to run, what I did is keep it wicked real and never to pretend)
They're going to destroy
(Everything in my path I'mma gas, I'mma spit it to the end)
Our casual joys
(I'mma take away your everything, I'mma merk it a bit when I begin)
We shall go on playing
Or find a new town
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
In the beginning it was negative wasn’t nobody checkin'
Or steppin' to this heavenly sick brethren, it's
Tech's veteran, better than clever man
You're gonna be off of your rocker when the chakra's on chopper, it's
Kinda funny having no money coming up
The number-one independent rapper, people running up
When the fact I'mma sum it up, way way back I was run amuck
Now I'm beastin' the nation, cheese generatin'
Now everybody know when the flame sprays
Fame pays, maintain brain crazed
Leaving them all leaking in pain, hey gang, wait
Get ready for Strange days

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I told them I was gonna ball for y'all
Did it all, they didn't wanna get involved at all, yeah
They said that I was gonna fall, but now I'm walking tall
They all saw wicked raw a stud yeah
Everybody will applaud the odd lyrical god
The fraud better kneel before Zod, yeah
Never ever will I dissolve, I'm a hog in the dark
So when they call, I'mma maul and claw, yeah
Wanna hate me, industry gotta face me
They be shaky, ladies say we may be the crazies
They hella Gacy, John Wayne the case be
The industry fake, soft and sweet like pastry
Look at all these mentions
Look at all this uber attention
Remember everybody saying that I wasn't gonna make it
But the Tecca Nina kept on inchin'
This ain't no dang phase
Never will my reign fade
On the come up and a one up on 'em
Man, it feels good to finally see Strange praised

[Outro: Jim Morrison & Tech N9ne]
Strange days have found us
(This is the trip)
And through their strange hours
We linger alone
(The best part I, really really like)
Bodies confused
(6, 7, Tech N9ne!)
Memories misused
(Fredwreck, Thank you brother!)
As we run from the day
To a strange night of stone[Intro: DJ Eazy Dick]

[Daz Dillinger]

Looped out, satined out -

[Soopafly]

The enemy wanna diss, nigga but how could he?
We hookers and hoodies, with a bag full of goodies, what!?
Now take that for what it's worth
I'll terrorize your territory and take over your turf
All these niggas is rob, but they was soft as a Nerf
Nasty as after birth, they say "ooh" after the verse

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm commercial, universal with no rehearsal
And when I'm in the hood I'm just so controversial
Niggas know me homie - the O.G

And prepare to get ill when the gangstas talk
Saggin' and flaggin' with the '7-trey draggin'
Smokin' like a dragon with the .4-4 cannon

So what y'all wanna say? (Huh, huh?)
What y'all wanna do? (Huh, huh?)

[Butch Cassidy]
You niggas trippin', while I'm steady dippin'

Lyrics cooking in that kitchen, you don’t measure up
I’m hot dog, the mustard's something you could never cut
Catch up/ketchup motherfucker, you still on level 1
They tryna take shots like Ketel One
Take it to the dome, niggas know this a breeze
Flow is cold as some snow and some skis
Stiffer than a popo, sayin' "Nigga freeze"
Got lines like the government, was handing free cheese
Shorty hit video record I’mma wreck her
Say I pushed the right buttons, got her feeling special
That’s cuz I don’t control her
Scared to show her dueces like Noah
Roses really speak, had to sink our friendship
Didn’t have faith but now I’m doing big shit
All about my gravy, say she want my baby
Cuz I’m getting cheese like them crackers, I’m at the Ritz
She’s tryina make a..

By back against the wall for assault brings the situation
Hit these tracks like stars for the ventilation
I’m in the lane with a dime that I’m penetrating
And her cat is real fat, yeah, Pappy Mason
So what you sayin? Who you playin? It’s that new shit
And L7 be them dudes that I grew with
Been screaming "king" since that nigga named Bling
Food for thought, then I eat plates clean
This shit is feeling right Spike, please Do The Right Thing
Squares spend they whole life rootin' for the right team
Yeah, but I’m sure you niggas know already
It’s that time of the month cause the flow is heavy
The more I levy, they break, my flow cocky
Cause instantly I see my style copied, that’s not me
Watch say it’s my time, A$ap Rocky
Chris Pine, I swear they can’t stop me
Y'all niggas gotta..

See I never like to party with girls
Eyes get starry
And niggas try to throw shots after throwin shots of Baccardi
In a twist of fate like Jeff Hardy, now I got 'Raries
Leavin they kid just to come in and drive the Ferrari
You ain’t thinking like me, ho you think like Steve Harvey
Keep your nose about my business and your ass off my Atari
That’s what the OG’s taught me so tell my nana I’m sorry
But some wack bitches scarred me in the hotel lobby
Baby face Vizzy, turn 50 bet they still card me
And if I had one of your biddies bet she’d still call me
Wanna determine if that’s a lie, don’t call Maury
Just check your girls Safari, history, bet she bookmark me
No, I used to front with those type hoes
But I said fuck it nigga I'll live my life though
She had a night robe, I had a nice robe
She had the lights low and I had the light bulb
Looks like I found me a...

[Hook]:
Situation, have myself some fun
Situation, have myself some fun
Situation, have myself some fun
Situation, have myself some fun

[Outro] [XV talking]:
Wuddup yall?
Squarians, that’s what I’m talkin to. I hope you all enjoying Volume 1 so far. Me and DJ Richie still in here. L7. You see, a lot of people, they get confused on what a Squarian is. You know, like being a Squarian ain’t about being a square. You know, so when niggas say that’s square, that ain’t squarian. That’s square, you know what I mean? It’s okay to be yourself, you know? And all we tryina do is promote living your life. That’s what being a Squarian is. About living your life. Love life, loyalty and living long like legends
That’s that L7, nigga(Intro)
Geah

Real Compton City G's on this one
My nigga [??] in the house
We gon set it off like this

(Verse 1)
Y'all niggas wanna toss on me
Throw sum
Get ready for the hot one here it come
Y'all scream like bitches scheme my riches
Too suspicious my Glock rocks to your jaw
Nigga just too vicious land of the lost
Who's the boss get tossed have you seen her
My Nina, she's catchin a misdemeanor
My rep gets bigger my finger on the trigger
I cocks the hammer back like 'fucks you nigga!'
I let loose shells fly like the [?spruise-goose?]
Push weight protects mine, much juice
I hoo-bangs with a gang and slangs caine
Fuck what you tryin to get nigga, it's my thang!
[??] cops more white and hit claims
I serves everything from white to mary jane
I'm hittin the one times with a fake last thing
Just to keep my ass on the streets, in the game, it's automatic

(Chorus)
I represent the hoodrats and the B.G's
The niggas on the corner whop white to make cheese
If you want some then niggas bring static
It's automatic

(Verse 2)
You need to get at me, I'm the G
Locin and provokin dips blocks with cavi
Search a ki' cross the street and smash out
The '63 bounce back to the same route
You fools best get the fuck off my cold tales
Gang tales of how the fuckin dead body smells
Late night horror shows in jail cells
Represent where you from no one to tell
Life ain't nuthin but the hood and snaps
Hoodrats carry work with straps in they laps
Quarter niggas with nicknames play craps
Enemies tryin to cross the front line
Get capped nuthin but escape, uh
Second flat my gat let loose like 'Rat-a-tat-tat'
The underground hero guess y'all is back
My custom, my khaki suit and a blue cap, automatic

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I make it difficult for a nigga to find me
Crazy-ass Hoo-Bangin G's behind me
You're fucked up for that last time fo' sho'
Now you know, two in your door, four to the floor
Any nigga wanna bring it-bring
I guarantee your ass will hear the Glock sing
Quick to hit out like [name] the street king
Shells ricochet up your body, ping ping
Eazy don't come to [??] pound
West to the chest
Is the best get-coast
On the contrary I shots down your post
You're gettin next to me, uh, too close
Close down your whole block froze down
Infiltrators end up-no sound
You sorry muthafuckas here's your showdown
Eiht caught a hot one now I'm county-bound, automatic

(Chorus)

(Outro)
Geah
Eihtype in the house c'mon

This is the archbishop .. Don Magic Juan
Skin in game, church

[Hook - Snoop Dogg]
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (pimp game)
And to me you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple, cause you know its played
Holla at 'em Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang (go ahead)
Okay "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga "Pootie Tang"
I got that bounce, to make her booty sway
That little cutie thang, 'Fred she's a beauty mane(man)

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Rollin' with a player cause thats what he was
And dedicated to his paper, Jesus!
On his bitches (hard as feeds, uck)
And if them law boys pull him over he won't freeze up
He got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa
With a pocket full of big faced Visas
They say its cheaper to keep her, now baby ease up
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up
Now sit your ass in the treezone
And do me a favor and turn the music up
Should I slap her, or should I freak her
I'll take the stronga, you can have the weaka
Speak when spoken to, yeah I broke a few
And by the way I was hoping you
Had a freak for me and a freak for you
I make 'em do for us
The thang you been wantin' her to do for months

[Hook]

[Don Magic Juan - talking]
This is the Chairman of the Board ..
The archbishop Don Magic Juan ..
Big Snoop Dogg .. is a boss playa
As a matter a fact
I was there when he was crowned 'Boss Playa', church

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
I had three on my right arm and four on my left
Lime green and gold, we was sharp to death
Had to catch my breath, watch my step
Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref
And call a timeout, before you put your dime out
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the "Wizard of Oz"
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it homie I just shake and bake
I won't fake to make you buy my tape
I say a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith
Up straight

[Hook]

[Break - Snoop Dogg (female voice)]
Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
Would you lie to me? (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever)

Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
Would you lie to me? (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever, whenever)

[Don Magic Juan - talking]
Big Snoop Dogg, lets you know ..
That this game ain't for no lame ..
If you got heart, you can play this game
But if your heart ain't right
We got a remedy for that, too
You gotta go see the wizard .. to get you some heart
And the archbishop Don Magic Juan is the Wizard
That's got the game .. for them lame
Boss Playa .. Boss Playa .. that's what this game is all about
Boss Playa

[Hook]

[Outro - Woman talking]
Gangsta, Gangsta, where you been?
Round the corner messin' with brothanem
Youngsta, Youngsta, you at it again?
Poppin' gats for the fuck of it, when you know you got ends
I don't think that you should be in the streets like that
You know you the fashion type of cat
Always in them stores, with major whores
Doin' things, bling bling
West Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin' smokin', always chokin' in the green
With the sticky in yo hand fo sho
Everybody round ya cause they know you got mo'
Wet Cristal, you like to get wild
You like to dip in yo six n shit
Rollin' through them streets, poppin' CPT
L.B.C. rollin' with me, ohh[Snoop Dogg]
Ride, ride
Rough, ride on, ride on
Roll on, roll on
What!, what!, what!
Ride on, ride on, roll on
Nigga what!, w-w-what!, what!, w-w-what!
Ride on

[Kurupt]
This is the game you wanna spit to a nigga
Let a nigga know it's all right, cascades
And G'z stompin' on niggas like parades
Escapades and charades played
When the stampede stopped
And it continuously Young Gotti
Seen so many bodies
Drop fours hop classics and drastic measures
Principle's a pleasure and penal endeavours
Whatever the case, whatever case, it's caught on a chase
When a chase, it began in the facial of race
Me and Fred, he make beats, I make rhymes
And Snoop, he controls and calculates
Impervious moves, the Pound Pentagon
Wit a pistols, I holla where the gangstas' at
Daz poppin' his coller, nigga sweet and sour
Pop Chucks and collers, rollin' through the streets in my '84 Impala

[Snoop Dogg]
Holla, holla, if you wanna
We gon' run it from the co'na, it's the killa Califo'nia
Ya see, I do it to ya
Cause I know it screw ya, ya try up do us
But you can't cause you lovin' this beat
Uh, uh... we dump, dump to make you pump, pump
We comin' wit the heat to make ya trunk bump
Freddy said he had a whole a gritty down to go steady
And stick up Eddie for his fedy and bring it all back to daddy
I want bread, cheese now put it on the patty
Knick Knack style, kick back and flip files
In the verge, on now listen now honey child
Bow Wow, do ya now, how ya like it doggystyle?
Smile and grinnin', sippin' on some gin'n
Roll wit a cap and ya all strapped in
Once ya back in, it's straight mackin'
I keep it crackin'

[Hook - 4x]
This is how we all get down
Bring back that "G" shit fo' me!

[Snoop Dogg]
I know I slept you, kept ya, fin'na fetch ya
Snatch ya back too, slapped you and rapped too
The vacuum sat 'chu and rat packed you, act two
Now what must I do, to get you back
To the way is used to see, D-P-G-C'ology
I'm not talkin' 'bout chemistry or biology
This "G"'ology, you feelin' me
Niggas be killin' me and willin' me
Silly he, thinkin' y'all gon' smash on me
Blast on me, the audacity
I'll take ya back to the ol' skool and let ya cut class wit me
Get some ass wit me
Then get us somethin' to drink and let you sip out the same glass as me
And now you a killa
And it was all over weed and a tall can of milla, illa
Kill a nigga like a flea
Bigg Snoopy D-O double gizzle
Way off tha hizzle my nizzle

[Goldie Loc]
I hit niggas and bitches if you fuck wit my mental
Cause I'm a killa and stick release ya pop like a pimple
If you don't got my money I suggest you run
Cause the Gold Loc, he do you like a 20 or done
Ain't no fun the way I play, nigga I plays fo' keeps
No details you've just been sweeped to sweep
Locations, directions, not even a trace
Bitch I doubt it, if ya body get found like waste
In the alley, killa Cali, this Eastsidaz Crips
Never slip, set trip, and smoke chronic dip
Cuz!

[Hook -4x]

[Traci Nelson]
Snoop Doggy Dogg has to give it to ya

I'm the milli-mac and the strong-end and nigga to blame you
And I'mma start callin' ya'll bitch niggas by name:
Mothafuck D, Mothafuck M, only X I know is Xzibit or RBX, extraordinary
Trying to snatch my bitch, you can have the bitch, two bitches gettin' rich
Just to come to the West Coast and get stripped down
Beat to death and stripped, all over a bitch
Now it's 50 MC's that ain't worth shit
Get ya ass kicked 50 times, beat to 10 cent
I love New York, but the niggas that represent, ya'll ain't shit New York

And when you hit the West, this is what we gon' do:

My motherfuckin momma bangin me harder
"Nigga take your ass out their and fight them tomorrow"
That's what she told me, "little punk, blame that on your father"
So I had no choice, nigga pick up a brick
Split a motherfucker's shit for tryin to fuck with the kid
Get a little older, hair on my dick, now I'm curious
Niggas on the corner getting money, rockin jewelry
Allowance, nigga that ain't man shit
Cowardice, nigga that ain't man shit
I had to prove to myself
How these niggas same age as me calculatin this wealth
So I got me a clique and niggas what?
Workin one sixteenth, like "nigga we can clean up"

[Hook] - 2X
Follow my life, homie from start 'til now
Only my motherfuckin momma nigga hold me down
And Lord knows all the shit that I done put her through
I speak through her, straight to you motherfuckers

I'm listenin to them hoes scream "O!"
And I'm listenin to them O's go CHOP! (*echo*)

Throw a extra bump bringin cline
I'm so involved with the grind, I'm losin my mind
Fuck a steady job, I'm tryin
I steady mob, I'm dyin in this game, I ain't lyin
Sellin so much coke forgettin it's a crime
Flyin down I-75, pocket full of dimes
Give a fuck about the radar on me (*police sirens*)
Bumpin +Big Poppa+ nigga who tryin me?

[Skit] (*Notorious B.I.G.'s +Big Poppa+ plays in background*)

Funk in the Cadillac truck with a chicken, bobbing her neck
You done woke up and ain't trying to sleep
You done called up Hugh Heffer to find the freaks
I'mma stay on the street
I'mma stay saying 'fuck you' behind police
My mamma ain't raise no fool, she love me
That's why she hide my tool inside her room
I'm a jump, bump, throw that ass
Rough sex, I gotta fuck with shoulder pads
I'm like baby powder, ain't nann 'nother
Ain't nann ho getting Redman butter
And my man Gutter, DJ Murder Inc
Ja know them hoes yo we can't love 'em
Underground the heat yeah I stay buzzing
Mixtapes I'm on the street they stay dubbing
Brick City riding,then 'bout it 'bout it
Shoot up you town then we Bin Ladin hidin'

Cause I stay on the corner like squegeemen
Yo Nate Dogg, what's happening y'all
Long Beach, Brick City
Scream at your frog

[Nate Dogg]
Everybody shaking

She was lost in the land of love
Glad that Nate Dogg found me
Girl you got a phatty
New York back to Cali
You know who got the bomb weed
Long Beach to Brick City

Turn that shit around, and back it up on me
Since I was the first, I guess I'll be the last to leave
D-O-double-G, will you keep it gangsta please

[Snoop]
I gots to do it
Yes Yes loc', we keep the best smoke
Me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk
I kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke
I'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke
You want a problem, then lets go
Cause if not I came to disco
And freak this ho from Acopoqo
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride
Let's go we hit the hood slow
Post up, set up shop and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know
Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke
But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast
In the summertime
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless
Square biz, you know what time it is
I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch
Now check dis, fact is
Put your back out, now back in
Go head wiggle it round you feeling me now
Girlfriend, you killing them now

Soldiers slash cash in over for the bitches I bust
Dog 'em out and talk 'bout how I touched the guts
Never ate it just skated once I bust the nut
Cold feelin hold children for hostage profits
Mob shit, witness how hot the Glocks spit
Drop bitch niggas trynna give us hassles
On they ass like the return of the jackals
Act on them folks, West Coast then lokes
Open quotes and homies know to go for broke

Muthafuckas take cover when my .9 explode

With his young homies Kurupt and X to the Z

Dumpin out the truck, Kurupt don't give a fuck
It's how the West Coast riders ride
Livin life nothing nice on the dice I'm
Livin life homicidal, domicidal with the dome arrival
With Goldie's star way 380 and Tray's rifle
Snoop's berretta or the Mack 11 from Kevin
Holler at the Reverend and look up to heaven
The hours rushed, and the cannons bust
Don't fuck with Tray Deee, X and Kurupt
Turn the page to exodus
And read the first line in parenthesis about war with us, fool

[Hook]

Getting locked in the gates of this L.A. zoo
You take this shit between two ?? like I do
How the fuck I'm supposed to be scared of you?
I ain't never gon' spit what I'm prepared to do
Cus I'm the first one they arrestin when this shit come true

[Hook - Tray Deee]
We gets payed to steal, gang bang for real
Slang thangs at will, known to blaze the steel
Niggas ain't for real, cats who claim to peel
Say you game to kill, but I don't think you will

[Tray Deee]
Little Goldie Loc, these niggas hoes to me
Lemme tell these motherfuckers how it's 'sposed to be
See crime merrily and better see ya rep to death
Squeeze ya enemies until they can't catch they breath
Don't sleep, tote heat, seven days a week
Whether to work or to church, snow, rain, or sleet
And don't bang with weak - motherfuckers who ain't wit it
Ain't no snitchin, take the deal and get convicted, stay commited
This mission is a vision to control the globe
Leavin scents where we step back and hold our own
Hold that zone, it won't be long, we keep it pushin
Livin on the edge and ain't lookin for no cushion
It's all in the hardcore game of death
Cuz you can't change ya steps, once you have claimed the set
Ain't no tattoo removal, fool, bang ya block
Or you could shake the spot, cuz now your face is hot
All that goin outta town, tryin to set up shop
And you ain't win up nothin buster, better check yo' props
Keep the sag hangin, rag swangin, gangsta walk
Leave opponents hood smokin, with the tape the chalk
Young homies to the G's stay swollen with cheese
Insane to the brain, rollin twenty's on D's
Throwin C's up, ease up, or get rubbed out
Cuz my whole squad hot and we stay thugged out

[Hook - Tray Deee]

[Goldie Loc]
Tray Deee, O.G., these niggas holdin me
Lemme show these motherfuckers how it's sposed to be
Mama, they got me in the shell again
But this time I think I'm headed for the state pen
I got too many problems, and I sure don't need 'em
As I fall to my knees and I begs for my freedom
Listen for my name, so I can get chain
I'm headed for court but this time I feel strange
With my eyes on the gate, with handcuffs on my wrist
I'm tryna find a way out, to hoppin the fence
5 o'clock, they might shock, to leave these shackles on my feet
I feel the heat it's gettin deep, both eyes open when I'm asleep
The big situation got me stuck in a drought
I've been squabblin everyday so my time didn't count
The major deal is that my brother told me, "Take no shit"
Cuz I might end up gettin out and comin home real quick
The plan for the lick was to do it overseas
Come back to the L.B., spendin 24 G's
Now you know me - straight up to no good
Little nappy head nigga always bellin through the hood
I kept my strap on my lap, and steadied the clip on the seat
All eyes on me, when your fuckin with a G
I was dedicated to seein the gangsta cuz
I keep my head on straight, with my brain on buzz

[Hook - Snoop Dogg]

[Snoop Dogg]
Ay B-A-D (whattup) These niggas hoes to me
Lemme show you motherfuckers how it's 'sposed to be
Keep a, bag of money with the grocery
And when I'm on the move I groove with the fo'fifth heat

[Bad Azz]
Check it out Eastsida, these niggas hoes to me
Now lemme show you motherfuckers how it's 'sposed to be
I'm just a Eastside, low-life nigga to death
We gone ride in any car, show with niggas the best
Peep the nigga that test, you shoulda put on ya vest
You shoulda, covered ya wig, 'fore I hitcha with this
It ain't no motherfuckin give back, when knees is crackin
If it ain't a gun war, we finna use 'em for jackin
And it's money 'round here, it's just hard to see it
And when you spot it, don't be so fuckin sure that you got it
You make it happen or not - you still grindin on the spot
You gotta give it what you got, still livin how it pop
It's a do-it-all-day type of thang, make it crack-a-lak
Fuck a jail cell, I'm on the beach in a Cadillac
Fleetwood, seven deuce nigga with the rag back
Bangin ol' deez like a cold O.G
Used to smoke wet 'til my day looked black
Used to pack techs 'til my pay looked fat
I have bitches transport them llello packs
Still the sam ol' nigga, I just slang dope raps
Hate, I feel like "so what", smash and get my dough up
You know what, point some heat at'cha when ya show up

[Snoop Dogg]
So niggas don't be runnin up up on the B-A-D
Cuz he be packin heat, and this is D-P-G-C
Uh-huh, it's off the hizzy
For real, beat by Fred Wrizzy
Makin them niggas get dizzy

You heard about the kid, you know how I rock
Went from pumpin bags on the block, straight to the top
So the money ain't a thing now, yeah that's right
Mansion after mansion, next stop the Hamptons
I splurge with it, I'm so absurd with it
Got the hunger to go get it, cause I wan' go spend it
You know how a boss player play, nigga I'm ballin
If there's money to be made, I'm all in
Catch me in a cherry red Porsche, beige seats, red pipin
You want me to teach you how to stunt, aight then
Tattoos on the arm, 30 karats on the charm
Cause the flow be the bomb, learn to respect the Don
First night if I don't hit, second night I want some shit
Third night we call it quits, I ain't fuckin with the bitch
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Another move another mill', let's get right - aight?

[Hook]

[Havoc]
You could, catch me cockin the fifth, got me rockin with Fif'
Now that's why you see the keys to the Bent'
Got my niggas movin the bricks, it don't stop
And a million dollar deal, homey get that gwap
See dudes get comfy, money ain't long enough
Come spit one verse, my whole crib's coughed up
Ma I got a fetish, fuckin in them Porsche trucks
Curtis got one so when I finished I tossed her
Y'all into wifin, we don't condone lifin
Only fuck with bitches that, got they liquor license
Shop high prices, shook all vices
Infamous nigga got the game in a vice grip
Chain hundred K but the flow, is priceless
Anything less? We rollin them dices
Nuts in the sand if you ain't bumpin my shit
Shorty wanna rip to my sound and my likeness

[Hook]

[Prodigy]
Listen - you can call me Gambino P or V.I.P
My wrists could buy a bitch a Ph.D
My rings alone could pay for you to eat
For the next few years I'm so icy kid
My flow is long money, my face is Hollywood
My tattoos gon' keep me with a thug part though
My attitude is universal, get harmed - call money
When we get back to Queens we gon' hurt you
Can't afford to ride, you gettin stomped out
I got a team of dimes, they all thonged out
Ready to line you up and take you out
My girls is hot man, they hard to turn down
You pee in your drawers lookin like you're Mexican
After lil' shorty wop wop break you off a lil' bit
You so stupid, we so much rich
And who braggin? I'm just tryin holla at the chicks like

Hey![Snoop Dogg]
Step inta the party as I bust a ho
I'll lean up on the wall until I'm ready to go
I'm sippin on some juice with a twist of Mo
Comfortable, smokin' some dope
The bitch that I'm wit is so flexible
From Mexico, man I like this ho
The homey little Tony told me a long time ago
"Hey Dogg sit there and smoke and grind the ho"
But you know me I don't dance too much
Unless that shit OD like the party's at the Hutch
What? what? remember double dutch
Ow, the bubble butch
All up in the party swangin' E's and C's
Wit a car full a heat, hope you want my beats
I came to the party dog by myself
Twenty out a twenty-one I'll leave wit somebody else
It's somethin about the way I rock a fuckin mic
Big Snoop Dogg what that Crip like
My nigga Fred Wreck with a G in the seat (ya know)
To make it complete (uh huh), cookin the beat (woo)
Takin' it back down Parliament Street
Look at this shit so funky, funky, coka, loca, ropa, dopa
Hit 'em with a smoka, pick a place to dope up

[Hook - Kokane w/ voice]
I pledge allegiance to the House for which it stands
We got some ghetto ass niggas, makin ghetto jams
OH what I'm feelin is that in my Cali ways
So roll some dope, (oww) and go ahead and blaze

[Goldie Loc]
God damn Loc here we go again
Steppin in this bitch to show these niggas how I did
Dogghouse done brought out this gangsta shit
And point blank, can't nobody fade my clip
Don't even thank the trick
You know what we ain't inta hatin
But anythin you tryin' to brang we ain't inta takin
Can't you tell these outfits cost a fortune
Security stay alert to use enforcement
Ass cheeks pass me, I grabbed 'em hips
Dancin through the crowd to a badder bitch
The gas was quick, but not for mack I spit
I stopped at Iceland and got this platinum dick
You can't attract a bitch, my game accurate
You wanna laugh and trip, I'm out to crack the whip
I ho that's fast and thick, and ain't gonna ask me shit
Get a blasted lip, and she attacked the dick
Yeah bitch

[Kokane]
We gon' bust and we gon' rip ride
Walk on to, to the other side
The most ignorant ass niggas in the game
Tray Deee, Goldie Loc, Big Snoop and Kokane
I'm come all night pickin up these freaks
Fuckin hoes make these bitch niggas buckle
Dogghouse we unstoppable
Uh, don't worry bout it, Crips control the mic

[Hook]

[Tray Deee]
I stepped in the party wit some blue and white Stacy's
Right side Kacey, left side Tracy
I'm feelin' like the shit, as I slide through grinnin
Dogghouse nigga don't you know we winnin
Left side gangsta, right side busta
Say the wrong thang and get shot motherfucker
When snitches get popped, the hood gettin' hot
Ain't no cops around town, they afraid of gettin shot
Keep it on the low low, fuck that gang bang
Slang 'caine, anythang for my paper mayn
It's easy to see (what) that I'm a motherfuckin ghetto ass G, can't fuck wit me
Do it do it, loco 'til your casket drop
I'm a do it cause the Crip pop don't stop
You think you can see me, I know you motherfuckers wanna be me
Light it up, blaze it up, ain't no need for chokin
If I had anotha blunt wrap I'd be smokin
Locin waitin on Wreck to get back
When he get back perhaps I'm blazin up a sack
So relax, that's snaps ain't right, it's all good
I got your back next time you dippin through the hood
Just make sure what you got insured is fine
You already know I got my money on my mind, nigga

[Outro - Snoop Dogg & others]
Fuckin wit these niggas ain't the way to go
Comin from the Eastside we so rep the boss
Checkin for your bitches, now we're fuckin ya ho
Dogghouse fo sho, we untouchable
Niggas who ain't wit it, betta duck and roll
Bitches know we comin and they lose control
Stepped up in the party and they rushed the door
Dogghouse fo sho, we untouchable[Snoop Dogg]
Aiyyo Queen Bee, it's Big Snoop Dogg

(Yeah Snoop, I feel you man)
(That package of Lil' Kim just be CALLIN me)
(Somebody help me, please!)
{*somebody, somebody please*}

[Lil' Kim]
Tell you why I'm so damn fly
One hit of me and you'll be so damn HIGH
Plus I got that hydro flow (so sexy)
Come and get yo' head right (nigga)
He's an addict of my pillow talk
Hourglass body and my runway walk
I got a sweet tooth for the chocolate guy
See him lickin on his lips with his chocolate thai
He'll have my wrists lookin like rainbow bright
Once he stick his pipe in this atomic light
Lil' Kim have you fiendin fo' mo'
Get you higher than a jar of that {??}

[Hook - Snoop singing w/ help]
Girl yo' shit's the chronic (chronic chronic)
{*shit's the chronic baby*}
Like a strawberry bag of weed
{*like a strawberry, bag of weed I*}
One hit of the chronic - woo, OWW!
Brother, she'll put yo' ass to sleep
{*she'll put yo' ass to sleep*}
{*ahh, na na*}

[Lil' Kim]
My sugar daddy from Brooklyn just sent me a page
He tryin to come blaze some of this watermelon haze
Pretty girl keep him home for days
Bustin nuts and seein circles from this bag of sweet purple
Homies out in L.A., call me Lil' Sticky
Got G's walkin with my name on they dickies
Get'cha higher than Amsterdam, God is my witness
I put the red light district out of business
They want me off the streets, they say I'm illegal
I'm more potent than a pound of sour diesel
Lot of copycats, don't make that mistake
That homegrown shit'll give yo' ass a headache
Who's that peepin in my window
Tryin to get a toke and a sniff of this indo
This bag of Kim have you ready to spark shit
I'm the hottest product out on the market

[Hook] w/ different ad libs

[Hook Two - same people]
I'm addicted to the chronic
{*said I'm addicted to it, baby*}
Baby girl what'cha doin to me

Ain't nothin like the chronic

[Lil' Kim]
I got the fiends lined up coppin my shit twice
Nookie get you so nice I got to raise the price
Got dudes puttin up they cars, cribs and ice
Centurions, for a hit of this Lil' Kim
Toppa toppa my Jamaican bredderns
Rude bwoy dem come holla at a legend
Throw your dutchies in the sky if you're fresh from yard
Honey girl leave ya 'round the morgue (honey girl)
Sayin damn ma, I love you like de lah
De ganja, sensi-milla
Can I feel ya, just wanna touch ya
I told y'all before I'm the ultimate rush
The chronic nigga

[Hook] w/ all new ad libs

[Hook Two] w/ new ad libs

[Ad libs to fade](Intro-Kurupt)
Yeah, gangsta's make the world go 'round
I heard that's true
Make things go up and down
I heard that's true

(Verse 1-Kurupt)
I been through the full-court pressure stage
The homies gave me a nine
The first time I saw a gauge
The first time I put my feet...
Down solid mashin on top of concrete
Before all the ways of war
House and car doors felt the rays of war
When life was simple as shit
And we didn't give a fuck about a bitch, 1986
It's all about lic's, heat in the streets
Trucks with the beats
Bitches with biker shorts worn all tight
Tryin to get a pussy just worn all night
Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest ho's
Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
Back in the days, Elco's, S-S's
The best is where the west is niggas don't test us

(Chorus X4-DJ Lethal)
Just lay it on back (Hey)
Do you wanna ride?

(Verse 2-Fred Durst & Kurupt)

(Fred Durst)
Back in the days where them laces were thick
I was concerned with break dancin and layin some dick
For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin the smurf
And I'm walkin on this Earth, like I don't give a fuck
And now I'm rollin up in third gear
With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
And corrupt's my lifestyle, so shut the fuck up
And back the fuck up with that buck free style

(Kurupt)
Nigga what freestyle, nigga

(Fred Durst)
Walkin on a razor blade

(Kurupt)
Comin through I got it made, posted up in the shade
Comin through to get paid
Sunny California baby

(Fred Durst)
I got dubbs in my trunk and it's bound to bump
Straight smashin, hollerin out what's up Kurupt?

(Kurupt)
Wassup, I'm fillin in my right mind, one to the head
And I'm on the smash hollerin out 'what's up Fred?'

(Chorus X4-DJ Lethal)
Just lay it on back (Hey)
Do you wanna ride?

(Verse 3-Nate Dogg)
I don't give a fuck so fuck what they say
Nigga won't you pass, say pass the bombay
Niggas they decide to ride and they ride
Niggas they decide to lie and they die
I can bust a fleet of ho's with my skills
I can make them ho's bow down pay my bills
Can't think I can make them ho's convert to my will
Wanna bet I'll turn them ho's to my scrill'
If you love a bitch a bitch can drive you crazy
Anything a hooker do it won't amaze me
You better be up on your game homie cuz they be
They may talk a lot of shit but they can't fade me
If you hang around with suckaz then you may be...
Anotha type of brotha I don't want with me
When you compensate with bustaz you confuse me
Cuz I'm tryin to stay out the penitentiary

(Chorus X4-DJ Lethal)
Just lay it on back (Hey)
Do you wanna ride?Ya know we peepin' y'all
Slow-motion-style
Pacific Ocean-style (Wh-what?)

[Verse one]
I'm in a rowdy-ass club
There's hella-bitches all around me
This girl walks up
She says she's glad that she found me
I told her she was trippin' cause the girl ain't even know me
Then she told me
She want to introduce me to her homies
I said "Well, baby girl, go get your kemo sabes"
"I'll get my Liquid niggas"
"We'll meet you in the lobby"
She walked wit' a smile I ain't seened in a while
So we mobbed through the crowd--
Killer-Cal-style
Walkin' wit' a limp, cause see, we pimp to perfection
For us to catch a date don't take the Love Connection
Fuck Chuck Woolery
You want a date for surely
All it take is fine jewelry
A wink and a drink and what the fuck you think?
I mack a baby doll down, she in a long black mink
We straight standin' in the lobby straight face-to-face
Then she said "Cut the chase"
"Let's bounce to my place"

[Hook]
Cause ladies
We wait for nightfall
You thinkin' that we sleepin' but we peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, baby doll
You can't walk before you crawl

[Verse two]
Still close to gettin' toasted by the b-a-r
About to bounce wit' these bitches cause they don't live far
Niggas all up in my grill, lookin' hella-bizarre
I poured my drink on the ground for my dead homey Par (Rest in peace)
Grabbed my car keys
My doctah function
Burnt a little rubber
Made my outroduction
Pumpkin' and her friends pushed the two-door Benz
I pushed the E420 so we looked like twins
Swervin' through the night
Everything is right
Swift rolled a blunt, but he can't find a light
Just when we 'bout to blaze it up and get high
I peeped the one-time out the corner of my eye

[Hook]
Cause one-time
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin'
But they peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, killer-cops
You can't walk before you crawl

One-time
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin' but they peepin' all o' y'all
Wanna throw a nigga up against the wall
But slow down, killer-cop
You can't walk before you crawl

[Verse three]
I rolled past the cops
I'm on my cell phone blown
Doin' 60 miles-a-hour in a 35 zone
Just when I thought it was about to be on
The girl pulled into the gate of a million-dollar home
Fly landscape and cavi' decorations
The living room was bigger than the Club United Nations
Place was to the point I kicked my shoes off the secko
30 percenters--
When I talked it made a echo
Rolled up the fat perfecto
They wanna skinny dip but I ain't wanna get wet though
So...
Let's go
That's what she told Tash
She led me to her room, lookin' like Stacey Gash
Baby got it pumpin'
Can't help but to feel it
Then she told me that she married to a killer drug dealer
Should I: a) stay
Or: b) bounce immediately

[Hook]
Cause haters
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin' but they peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, baby pa'
You can't walk before you crawl

Can't do it
Ya can't do it
Ya can't walk before ya crawl
That's right y'all
Slow-motion-style
Killer-Cali on the mic
Catastrophe fuckin' it up all the way from the Bermuda Triangle
Hottest shit on the streets
1998, '99, 2000
Raise yo' glass
Raise yo' glass to Tash
Raise yo' glass
And make a toast to Tash
Now
Straigt up
Not tonight
Not tonight
We got Tash on the mic
Not tonight[Adil Omar]

Off the handle, I'm the raw example of a cyborg
Psych ward music, get strangled by the mic cord
Time warp; future isn't safe for you tricks
Struggle made me persevere but turned you into a bitch
It's verbal manslaughter, we stuck in traffic
You bitches honking horns while I turn this fucking ride into a Transformer
A damn problem and you wonder why I'm cocky
Cause I stay burning, hotter than a summer in Karachi

[Xzibit]

This is what we all about, scream and let you get it out
Fuck your fucking bank account, we ghetto trynna make it out
Of the ghetto with devil red, or Carolina blue
Then California where you from, who the fuck is you?
I came to bring the essence, seem like the essence left us
With no protection or recollection of our possessions
Witness the exodus, this is a migration
The numbers all match it, watch the women gyrating


[Hook: Adil Omar and Xzibit]

Now I got 'em like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

Islamabad, (get up!)
LA, (get up!)
Can't nobody hold me down


[Xzibit]

Why you waiting for it, to hop in my shit and floor it
Fifty foot tall gorilla, never to be ignored
Hallelujah, praise the lord, living by the sword
Never looking back, I'm too busy paying forward in life
Cause money ain't shit when your health ain't right
I bet I won't miss when you're in my sight
Witness the exodus, this is a migration
The numbers all match it, watch the women gyrating

[Adil Omar]

Yo, we playing Grand Theft Auto, without the console
Watch you and your man get caught up inside a plot hole
We rock shows like warriors; blast first
Energy like M.O.P inside a black church
(Hey) - Fredwreck bringing the bass
We throw a Molotov cocktail into the place
Feel the boom, cause I'm hip-hop's Shahid Afridi
At your fashion show; you're missing all your models


[Hook: Adil Omar and Xzibit]

Now I got 'em like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

Islamabad, (get up!)
LA, (get up!)
Can't nobody hold me down


[Bridge: Adil Omar]

You don't wanna front when I'm off the ground
Seeing that you really couldn't hold me down
Bangin' to the beat, going on and on
I'm flying off the handle, flying off it now

So many dogs wanna bark the bark
But you know that I'm already off the wall
Bangin' to the beat, going on and on
I'm flying off the handle


[Hook: Adil Omar and Xzibit]

Now I got 'em like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

Islamabad, (get up!)
LA, (get up!)
Can't nobody hold me down
