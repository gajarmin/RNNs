Affiliation like, Dilated Peoples

"Watch your ear drums pop"
"Watch your ear drums pop, got this rap shit locked"

"Planet Asia, ain't a damn thing changed" [Planet Asia]

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
The methods of melodic torture, mic mastery
I'm locally accepted, worldwide respected
So gimmie mines and meet your deathwish
Dead at the throat like floatin wit your neck slit
Be gone, I'm way beyond
My mind shines harder than your necklace
I just violate the streets until I Dilate the Peoples
Posse cut, kill the track, annihilate the sequel
Trigger-happy, anxious to earn a stripe
Like it was just put on
Initiation means death, burn the mic now meet your escort
If the shot's rusted, hot sauce for all you block busters
Duck it, you're fuckin wit the spot rushers
Bustin wit brand new artillery cocked
Straight out the metal shop, to catch you up close, dead on the spot
There goes your manhood
Mad Max, Terror your Dome for canned goods
Blaze you wit the heat, destroy my conscience
For the backward, easin up ain't in the plans
I leave MC's wit no stands
Ill conventions so deep in thoughts, the fans labeled it trance

"Iriscience ya'll" [Iriscience]
"MC Iriscience" [Iriscience]
"Rakaa you don't rhyme fair" [Iriscience]

[Verse 2: Iriscience]
Aiyyo we hit it festivals, and we hit it the nightclubs
We hit it like Brad Pitt did it to Fight Club
I love it and live it
If you want it, then come and get it
I'm like Show and AG, or Alomar how I spit it
It's the highly-developed, well-equipped intelligent
You're a target if you're soft, pastel, or delicate
I'm bold cuz everything goes at pro caliber
A top competitor, a worldclass traveller
Spell-the-name-right.com, check the site
Like they could check the date on a dime from satellites
I move like Coltrane, pushin a blue tray
Rakaa's my name, style Fatal like Hussein
Wit Planet Asia, Defari, and Everlast
Phil Tha Ag and Ev deliever the weather fast
Joey Chavez, and a butcher named Babs
Dilated, now take that shit back to the lab

"Man listen" [Defari]
"From L.A. and it's finest" [Iriscience]
"Defari" [Defari]

[Verse 3: Defari]
They wanna jack who?
Step up and I'll dump
Invade and face the rage of a twelve gauge pump
Yo chump, I'm not that guy, my name's Defari
I roll wit the fo' sho' logo, the open eye
Dilated, heavy rotated, Golden Stated
So many dream of the sound that me and Ev created
Everybody wanna be rhymin wit two left feet
That's like a cripple man in lane five at the track meet
You wishin on a star but you lookin at the sun
I be the one who takes it so serious, it's more than fun
Pro sport wit a bottle of Crown and quart of Guiness
The ink fill up the paper in a matter of minutes
Whether from Brooklyn or Venice
I travel wit mental fitness
Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did this
So quit it, quit wit the nonsense, you harmless
Leave the hip hop alone and get your fix from a pharmacy

"Everlastin fresh" [Defari]
"Whitey Ford brings the devastating mic control" [Everlast]

[Verse 4: Everlast]
I read the New Testament and gave it up for Lent
All the places I went just to pay my rent
Used to keep me bent, on a ritual daily
Cock my hammer, spit a comet like Halley
I'll buck a .380 on ones that act Shady
I'm original like Grady, check my Sanford, Son
You know you ain't the one that rep peckerwood status
I'll bust that ass, keep your eyes on the floor
What you comin here for, son you know the law
Let's take it back to the house, slide off your blouse
Lift up your skirt and expose your panties
For the world to see, you can't rep it like me
I'm Communist, terrorist, vandalist
Catalyst, scandalous, masacous, never miss battalist
You must be crazy, or just plain dumb
You might catch a beatdown now where I come from
It's like that

"Crescent Heights, get the name right" [Phil]
"You know my mothafuckin name" [Phil]

[Verse 5: Phil Tha Agony]
Phil Tha Agony, a superhero
Creatin miracles, Analyze This like Robert DeNiro
Wit your air-tight vaccuum lungs
Got your stupid ass ? ?, chewin gum, bitin your tongue
Bleedin, what is it that you're really needin
Is it fresh air to breathin, a bank account so plenty of cheese in
Take into consideration, wit every situation that you're facin
Analyze the operation
What's the function? Who does the label work, who does the paper work?
Who's the president behind the desk, reclinin the best
Too many fake fraudulent artist, ignoramusus
Gettin famous-es, tryin to steal my whole name in this
That's why every move is documented
It's the unprescedented, rhymes that I invented
R-rated, Phil Tha Agony and Dilated
Crescent Heights, we're stealin your height, violated

"'76 born bomb lyricist" [Evidence]
"Evidence...got another sound mission" [Defari]

[Verse 6: Evidence]
Yo ya'll, my shit is timeless
A clock wit no hands, a hourglass wit no sand
My lifespan's been written before anyone cloths or ribbon
I've started their path, but what I've said just passed
The labcat's back, that's why I feel like I've been chose
To rise to occasions wit hits like Pete Rose
Speak to myself, but once I say when
No mistakes allowed, sketch my letters in pen
Permanent ink, unleaded gas tank ready to drink
Open all flows in perfect border insync
Total chaos, mass confusin
Just entered the playoffs, yo my team's not losin

"Platform, ultimate" *repeat to end*[Hook]
Don't it make you feel alright?
Say it again
*yeahhh*
Say it a little louder
*yeahhhhh*

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
I should call this liver
V8 Juice, black licorice nasty
You can't outclass me
Too much street savvy
I speak stern
Picture me robbin' a cabbie
I used to put regs in baggies
Now I puff meds of algae
I crumple up pieces of bong hits
And load 'em in my M420
(Then what?)
And provoke more envy
Send me my dough in advance
Steal from me?
And leave with a hole in your hand
Yeah
The heater stay clipped up
Your chick is a walking strip club
We throw her the dough and she dance...wherever
I better bet her I'm better, bet a motherfuckin' bow
I'm doin' rappers bold
I punch his lights out like, "Damn, he's out cold."
I slaughter for my honor, you leave with head trauma

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
All hail the fly wise men
My enterprise been on the rise and
I see you sizin' us
Large bark leaf, dark leaf, blendin' my broccoli
The pot in me has got me seein' it all sparkly
I'm a mobster
Loungin' with my bitch eatin' Long Beach lobster
I love me some fish
And them hatin' ass niggas wanna know if my shit sells
I'm good in the hood as long as I got fish scale
You'll never find a nigga that's this real
To ash blunts on the Aston and treat a Benz like a big wheel
And you ain't gotta tell me my shit's ill
Cause if I leave with your main squeeze that bitch will
And you better sit still
And chill when I fell for the jooks
Niggas get billed and killed for the fraudulent looks
For the big bills I'm mobbin' with the gods and the crooks
And I guarantee you that shit'll slap hard in the trunk

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Guilty Simpson]
Big dog, I'm a Rottweiler
I'm gettin' bread, I'm a stockpiler
I'm cold-hearted for a hot dollar
See rappers gettin' buzzed tryin' to sound like me
I just smile like a proud father
Loud ganja
You think I give a fuck about your list?
Them clowns don't exist
That's how I feel with a skill set like this
I hit 'em with a black fist
? style afro pick
The gats go click and clack at 'em
He holler back at 'em
With more force
I'm all for us
To travel to your home court
(What?)
And go to work to work with a blow torch
Torched ya scorched ya whole corpse
There's no remorse for 'em
Talkin' ain't enough, we use brute force on em
We never let it ride
So violate mine?
Just know
You cats got a war comin'

[Hook][Talib Kweli]
Yea
That's what I'm talking about
S-A-S, size ain't shit, never that
Strong Arm Steady, Talib Kweli
Yea

[Hook x2: Talib Kweli]
Niggas gettin caught in the trap
For the cash, it's the drugs; basketball; or the rap
There's more to us than that
We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
You know you best to fall back

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
I'm dealing with, nothing but facts, when I spit it, though
You niggas superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the pole
Candle light, flickers so bright, my silhouette can kick a sicker flow
And spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance
I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants
I spit the shit to make a motherfucker call it a night
I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like
I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute
I play this well to win it, you go to Africa, like Dave Chappelle, you finished
Cause your prehistoric raps is boring, the number of whack rappers soaring
Like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions
These niggas meek, their lyrics weak, and their beats is corporate
They try snitching on records their mouths is leaking faucets
Dripping them over system than, Chinese water torture
Ripping a series of events, more unfortunate than Lemony Snicket

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
Medallions mind, bless the mic for the gods, teach the blind
Plus get a piece of mine release your minds for each design
Baby food for thought, rappers not coonin' for sport
Due to these pork eatin niggas of sort
Yo you's a fuckface, burnt out loser that's always up late
Planet Asia the revolutionary slash nut case
A witchcraft black magic, data load up computers
A spread the message wrote to you where when I show illusions
If all y'all niggas is killas then how you write your records
How'd you find the time stop lying, your minds' infected
There's only a few, and I ain't saying niggas don't put it down from you town
I'm talkin bout you
Yea the fake dude promotin propaganda
And open on some fanna, and out right, snitching on them cameras
Planet Asia, gold chain black bandanas low
Steady Gain Klick Klack rang rang, there they go

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Phil Da Agony]
Just a high skip and a jump
Away from getting everything that I could possibly want
And prostitutes front
Get a 4 bar on the roster, scratch that
I'm talkin about a full roster of raps
Monsters that rap, buzzed out ?? check the cadence of the frequency
Uniquely, we strong arms strategically
Easily I twist the ?? killa cali ??
Back alleys burnin backwoods in danelis or
He probably with Kweli, out in BK
We make it easy for the DJ's, like instant replays
Conversation by the buttons, I talk and touch something
Straight shots of the Louis he flew me out to London
Crunchin numbers flippin more dough, like siccisero
Next thing you know we kissin ya ho, without the mistletoe
Strong arm steady, agony can ???, fill the rigglies
The Big League niggas is dropping indies
Let's go

[Hook x2]

[Talib Kweli]
Talib kweli, right about now
This what I'm feelin right about now
And I invite you all to check it out wit me
Lets go!

S'like

[Hook x2][Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that watches every time I lie
Face that laughs everytime I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me right underneath my skin

[Hook: Chester]
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Rasco]
Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds, hundred degrees
My soul, bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust they screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames

[Planet Asia]
All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I wanna do is smoke a blaster beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly it keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another person
There's nothing worse than trying to bring yourself up back from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

[Chester]
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The the face inside is right beneath your skin
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!

[Chester]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down

It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)

I feel the light betray me
The sun

Can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

[Fades out][Verse 1: Planet Asia]
I heard you went platinum on your first album
But tell me this: why is it now I heard you only sold about 200000?
Now what's that tellin you?
That your fans was never down
Got you wonderin now
'Maybe I shoulda stayed underground?'
But you can't come back, cause real rap fans, they hate you
You over-did your image, now you can't stay true
All glittery and shiny lookin empty on the camera
With nothin to say, dancin with the mic like who..?
Y'all cats done fell off, and we in this for the long term
20 years from now the Cali Agents still burn
Next to whoever doubt dare the rep through
Planet Asia, Rasco, Cali Agents ghetto respected

[Hook]
Never forget where you came from
Never forget where you got your name from
And the game from
The laws of nature won't bless you
You'll be forever unprotected
Rasco, Planet Asia, yeah, ghetto respected (2x)

[Verse 2: Rasco]
Hey yo, praise the king, the real thing
I be ready to bring the quick swing like I'm still 16
28, out of the gate
I tried to reach y'all but couldn't relate
We in a whole other state
Mind-travellin
While you niggas still battlin
The illest MCs you cats really ain't challengin
We on the mic, better get it in flight
You know excactly how it's done, we be keepin it tight
Yo, you keep it real, I be cuttin the deals
I bring it right up to your chest, give you somethin to feel
Still they wanna test, still dissin the West
The first thing that I learned: never listen to press
Because only as good as your last LP
The next time out your ass couldn't sell three
Now it's for free, the price came down quick
I flip it around and make the shit sound sick
Remember where you came from. don't act dumb
When a nigga ask
If you do it for the cash
Let it be known, I know half of y'all fake
The other y'all take the whole damn cake

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Planet Asia & Rasco]
Now who the fuck said the West can't rock?
It's Cali Agents in the house, y'all niggas best just jock
For all y'all fake-ass industry niggas that ride dicks
Of certain clicks, get a load of this brand new shit
Yeah, hot off the press, never settle for less
We bend half-assed niggas for a person undressed
The best, we double-team now livin a dream
And now you lookin at some shit that ain't never been seen
Befo', full-grown kings connect to get dough
But yo, the cash and the ass ain't the only thing we spit fo'
It's on again, it's back to emceeing again
Now I can walk through my own hood with a g in my pants
Cuffed up tight better, start livin it right
We here to take this whole thing to ridiculous heights
We might give it to some that can give it some run
But you can never ever forget exactly where you came from

[Hook][Verse One: Rasco]
Ayo fresh out the cut, we armed with bombs
Cali A the tag team, still for the cream
Planet A to the soul, man you niggas know the rest
The best at putting minds to the press
Hit y'all with 20 or more
What these other cats spitting it for?
Better quit, I still spit ridiculous shit
Over beats I be running over tracks
I double back and smack through the cracks of the wax
My hands is looking for grands
Nothing but concrete plans in the mind
This combo is one of kind
Once in your lifetime will you ever see (What?)
A better breed of MC
Stepping to us can cause a whole lot of fuss
We ready to bust y'all, I couldn't trust y'all
Me and my man be at the joint on point all day
Entering the extra dark hallway
Find me chilling at the crib with the kid
Y'all be running on that 0 and 10 skid
Peace to Wildchild and my nigga Madlib
Rasco the nigga with the illest adlibs

[Hook] {x2}
Now who think the style is fresh?
Man you running with the best
Express and bless straight from the west
Hit y'all with double the dose
Man you couldn't come close
We plan to run the whole damn coast

[Verse Two: Planet Asia]
It's like magic how we make shit crack
Cali Agents on some hungry shit
Boom bap and battling raps
You can't forget the scratch
With forty deuce throat cutting like slash
We  in the lab but we ain't wrote nothing
And we on something
All you can say is we all rhymes
But the fact is these cats only think small time
Ayo building on these tracks like blocks
Full of stock, ghetto warfare, prepare for ammunition pon cok
Once rhymes ricochet across the globe
In an example precise
Negotiating life lines in the verse
Let off some shit
I'm quick on the draw
To bust like dick in ya jaw
Anything to make my competition fall for the trap
Cali Agents all over the map
You know the steez, most of my shirts match my fisherman hats
One, two yo
This is just preparation
For my bredren get him locked down in the stations
I shall blaze one
Light one, save none
No fronting, end the circumference of who the Agents
Strike first
Windpipes or mic thirst, my verse can your star burst the Earth
We getting down under the surf'
Thought we were phony?
We don't just conceal it we reveal it
So we slapping you in your face just to make sure y'all people feel it
Thought we were phony?
We don't just conceal it we reveal it
So we slapping you in your face just to make sure y'all people feel it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Rasco]
Ayo Ras' be the man yo
Coming with a lot of ammo to shoot
Rhyme for the loot
Pull y'all from under the roof
You a full time substitute
I teach then try to reach
The masses and if I not I rip out they asses
For trying to skip the Cali Agents rap classics
Classic
Lay it all down to plastic
Remember the days of getting fucked up and blasted
But no more cause this cats got a whole lot to live for
Still banging on the door
Off of the hinge, better go tell your friends
You looking at Ras' he's on the wide screen lens
Top ten at any damn time we can rhyme
We bringing the rain and niggas singing sunshine
My time is now gotta strike to the mic
But ten years strong and still down for the fight

Medallion's made man, the alien
Watch what you play me in
The vibrational tone is radiant
I was born in the desert where the sands is heated
As a liquid youth I ran wit the lions and cheetahs
A bunch of street corner hustlers, thugging for G's
Grew up on them food stamps and government cheese
Soul babies of the 70's, black and baptist
The 80's came, I found my blackness
Nine years old in 85, I caught Godly's spark
Cuz the God's were sharp, that's how I found my heart
Heads spinning on the sidewalk, we did it after dark
1989 I wrote my first dart
To the beat y'all, it was super scientific
Wanted to quit, until my Uncle told me I was gifted
So lucky me; now we're all here to sing to the throne of the Supreme
Kiss the ring, 'All Hail the King'

(Chorus) Planet Asia 2x
Medallion is the King is here
So you can put all your valuable things in here
Lucky me; now we're all here to sing to the throne of the Supreme
Kiss the ring, 'All Hail the King'

[Planet Asia]
The valedictorian, my story is handwritten
You can see my transcript in Sanskrit
Purple mediation makes me move the quill
Cuz the dude is ill and his jewels is real
Practice makes perfect so I choose the bill
Cuz if I choose the chill then I can lose the skill
And if I listen to the radio I lose the thrill
So I make music that I like and choose to hear
So to know what I'm about you gotta use ya ears
And might lose ya peers, some might view it as where
But what they don't understand sometimes they fear
That's why the time is here for the mind to clear
So part ways from your plate if the swine is near
I got rhymes prepared to give the blind some care
So lucky me; now we're all here to sing to the throne of the Supreme
Kiss the ring, 'All Hail the King'

(Chorus) Planet Asia 2x

[Planet Asia]
Now I got you like "Yes Lord"
Yes everything before I snatch your most important piece upon the chessboard
Give that shit a rest, or...
I'll be leaving wit ya Queen cuz I seen that you came in wit ya best tour
Cold like the early morning winter
Pimp the pen like I rock Shirley Temples
Get it in wit a pen not a pencil
Permanent ink, cuz it's all in the mental
Let it come out dark and dreary
You start to feel me; the crowd can cheer to mark ya ending
Luckily that we're all here to sing to the throne of the Supreme
Kiss the ring, 'All Hail the King'

(Chorus) Planet Asia 2x[Planet Asia (Tri State)]
Peace True Self
(Peace Power Allah, what's good?)
Man I was on the way-way, man
These Babylons was behind me
I had the Allah Rule in the car, you already know what I had to do
(Peel his top off right?)
Yeah you already know, they out here try'na sacrifice the Gods
But you know I can't let it go down like that, fuck all that

It goes Fuck the Police, right off top
My Chain Military strike with accurate shots
Fuck marching and protesting
We're armed with them ARs and Smith and Wessons
Militant mind connection out the West in Kern County
I lick a shot at a crooked cop before I let him Mike Brown me
Jettin' through the turf on foot, I'm try'na push
Out of breath, if ever caught by these crackers, I'm cooked
So I plan strategic, cause it's a tactical war
Espionage way beyond the Spook That Sat by the Door
Babylon is fallin', never forget about New Orleans
Heed the calling, the battle was won before it started
My people El captured by the river of Egypt for sleep
Peep the political thesis, unh
To all my killers, righteous black guerillas
Death Angels, we shall no longer be the prisoners

[Hook]

[Tri State]
Overnight freedom fighter type
Black revolutionary caught up in the hype
Headed for the cemetery, hand over fist
Fist to the face, hand over chips
What's a brick to the safe
Pure Panther, pop at a pig' wig for answers
Mark of the militant streets cheered the anthem
Live from Missouri, caught a train from ?ville
Zimmerman pursued me, gonna hit him with two shells
Novus Ordo Seclorum, fill out a form
In the name of the dollar you raid, they were sworn
To Kill a Mockingbird, crowds flocking by the herds
The Devil fear the power of my words
This is Jesse Jackson, Minister Farrakhan
The Reverend Al Sharpton strapped with a firearm
Ready to ride like "Who ready to die?"
I keep a molotov lit and I'm aimin' at genocide

Aiyo, shit that nigga got an afro too, my dude
(That’s really motherfuckin’ Bruce Lee!)
Aiyo, I knew yo’ ass wasn’t dead, my nigga!
Teach me some shit...move my chi
Fuck one of you niggas up...)

[Verse 1 - Planet Asia]
Yo
Back in your section, everything goes in this battle
Chinatown wars, Chinese connection
Comic book Coogi color, cloth kente
Five Percent-ey, avenge the death of the sensei
Break out the bad guy, so I can kill ‘em with styles
I’ve been honing my craft so long I got spiderwebs on my blend tapes
In shape like a ape, fresh off the Himalyan mountains
Wylin’ off bananas and grapes
Cop diesel, OG Bubba and Sour Diesel
Skies burn, ‘cause nigga it’s my turn like Steezo
Steady-B mentality, cool seek propositions
It’s for my killas in the streets without a pot to piss in
Don divas, calm leaders, beyond eager
Golden glove thugs, bob and weavers
You just a non-believer that’s hating, ‘cause I done hit
Every House of Blues, the only thing left is coliseums
Another loose leaf, who’s chief?
Give you a two-piece
To the beat
This is Bruce Lee!
[Adlibs]
(Jeet-Kune-Do, mother fuckers!
Get yourself fucked up coming around here!
Murder one of y’all niggas, man!)

[Hook - TriState]
Righteous roundhouse, Deathblow dojo
King of the dumb-out, I’m on my Bruce Lee mojo
Breaking bricks there’s money to get
Or get your money stripped
We revolve around scientists
Another looseleaf, who’s chief?
Give you the two-piece
No biscuit, nigga
Bruce Lee

[Verse 2 - Rasco]
(Nigga, that is not no Bruce Lee, that’s Jim Kelly, man!)
Chop suey, you’re andouille, ya backflip
Double stack grip, play games, smash shit
Cartoons get smacked soon, we black goons
Get in tune, these niggas soft like sand dunes
Cats get it, they bowing down, the god spit it
The odd digit is seven, dog, you last minute
Stay ahead of these wack lames, exact range
Pointed right at your eyeball, we fly y’all
Better look to the sky y’all we up there
Roll a Benz, you ask mama for bus fare
In the plush where, you really should rush there
Burn your whole click, leave nothing but dust there
Just the tip of the iceberg, we still cold
Smash dudes and take it out of their billfold
(What the fuck is wrong niggas, I’mma kill you niggas)

[Hook]
Righteous roundhouse, Deathblow dojo
King of the dumb-out, I’m on my Bruce Lee mojo
Breaking bricks there’s money to get
Or get your money stripped
We revolve around scientists
Another looseleaf, who’s chief?
Give you the two-piece
No biscuit, nigga
Bruce Lee

[Verse 3 - Chace Infinite]
Fly as a falcon in a cockpit
Flying cranes, guillotines
Breaking down K’s with chopsticks
Obnoxious African arts, nigga my reflex sharp
I roundhouse Abdul-Jabar
I achieve doctrines, Wu shu postures
Two-piece, backhand niggas with no problem
Master of any street you know
Come see the Jeet-Kune Do
Iron fist lunge, lethal blow
Every nigga on the street should know
‘Cuh-razy, not karate’, putting holes in your body
You tough niggas is the first to get shot in the party
While I’m smoking like the samurai, Afro
Taking heads, discipline my enemies
Fuck that, I paint the town red
With the remains of y’all
Really it’s not a game at all
Bruce Lee, nigga, sweat suit, gold chain and all

[Outro]
(That’s some heavy shit
Let me explain something to you, Super Nigga
I don’t answer questions, I ask ‘em
Even if I did know who killed that jive-ass brother of yours
What make you think I’m going to tell you?
Get your black ass, off of my joint
Before we beat you, like a rented mule)[Planet Asia]
Cali Breeze, Planet Asia
Cali Breeze
Through the mist, I stays true to this
No matter what the opportunist consuming, confuse me not wit foolishness
I stand on earth as the Asian beneficant
Vocalist, don't wanna focus cuz the brokest ones be the best rappers
To keep you listenin, but still that ain't true
Cuz you can make a million bucks and still all praise due
To the highest degrees, I manifest to be the flyest MC
My final chapters you been dyin to see
Cali Breeze, male and fishy cuz these cats be killin big fish
For small change, dyin off without eatin the big dish
Witness life at its worst, evident witness at the finest
I Timex raps to keep my stats at a climate that's cool
Cats only climax cuz cats make sense
Cuz how the fuck you 'bout to MC when you can't make rent
For shelter, so keep it movin if your goal in life is shiesty
I hold the mic for days cuz rhyme pays, quoted by Ice-T
Precisely, I patternize thoughts that's frightening
Sometimes I drops lightning on the poisonous minds
I run the lines like Rasco but blown off hash though
G's for Cali Breeze cuz my steez is cash flow
And now you know the deal when Planet Asia's on zone
Lockin shit down forever massive and we keepin shit sewn

[Hook] A
It's a day to life struggle that bends the pavement for cheese
Cali Breeze, let me put you up on Central Valley steez
These cool cats camouflage through the hay
And we can tell if you's a snake just by the look on your face

[Hook] B
It's a day to life struggle that bends the pavement for cheese
Cali Breeze, let me put you up on Central Valley steez
These cool cats camouflage through the hay
And if you don't know the deal that you's about to get laced

[Planet Asia]
I be the major microphone that's on a mission for chips
In this game of life of survival, man I'm tryin to get rich
Fuck tryin to penny-pinch, endin up penny-less
Hollering bout you underground but really your shit sounds the most trendiest
I write rhymes like morning articles
My particles startle like terrortists takin hostages on Greyhound charters
Smoother than Collagen Elastin
Knowledge and pass when
I used to fantasize about fame, dollars, makin shit happen
Was my wish made true? My visions became the view
Cuz if it wasn't for my dreams I wouldn't rock it for you
Hip hoppin for you, droppin Cali when I socks it to you
Daily elevations the ritual, my conscience is true
From out the calm breeze climate, Cali palm trees alignment
Of gestures, generates words to execute assignment
Foreign, world wide tourin, naturalistically explorin over-seas
Planet Asia, Cali Breeze

Chorus A

Chorus B[VERSE 1: The Alchemist]
Music is my medicine, I smoke calmly
I go numb, but never below zombie
Stay catatonic, wrapped in mummy cloth
Phony, balogny, bunny hops, but the money talks
And now is the only time I listen
Vision blurred trying to choose the proper words to describe my vision
Dramatic scenes finale, sway cream Bali, fourth quarter my team start to rally
Score numbers on the board in tally
Labratory like the tele, bodies laid out on the couch, blunts from the deli
Distract me from rubbing my belly, It get you stuck
Between the dirty asphalt and the rubber of my pirellis
Its a spiritual event, from above, the miracle is sent


[VERSE 2: Evidence]
Step, motherfucker step
I stepped out the door with what I lit up, still twisted
Dodging the system, it sees another victim
I have been plotting, looking at my plants in the pot
And I been looking for the answer, because I dance in the dark
I talk a lot of shit, it comes as good intention
When them bells rung and names drop, hits as good as mentioned
I was looking for a spot, cut a hole in the fence
Then I stepped back, and saw my entrance
They say times up
This the dotted where I sign up
This the lotto where I find bucks
This the motto that defined us
Coming out the gates enforces, lord choires, dropping shit like some horses
The house holy, but the office corporate
This life pricy, but the war absorbed it
So don't blame me for the caution, because I ain't trying to get lost
No, I cannot afford it


[VERSE 3: Blu]
Nah, this is not my love song, I mix my magic to the sun dawns
Busting like shotties to send the doves home
Blood bone, ripping in the rules of my toast, kissing my foes, looking for when I am kicking my flows
I visit home, spit get in the zone, pimp the bills on the stroll
Rolling up the mistletoe, getting stoned
My kid's at home, Mrs. I'm with his grown, my minutes on, nigga
Benita's on a mission, she getting on
We got it like bitches, that gossipin shit, wildin type
Wildin like we just got the island patrol the style is like a lion mount
Climbing a mount trying to break the throne
And set a staple like the Los Angeles Lakers forum
Same place that my cousin got them scrapers from
Play me dumb, I brought him right back to the stadium, nigga
Palladium nuggets, pre macadamia fucking raps, be immaculate, couldn't imagine making them
Mack emotionless, master records like I am slaving them, Sarah Palin
Paraphasia these shades dangling
I can't stop, won't stop, putting pieces together, pull my tech from the dresser
No one could do it better


[VERSE 4: Tristate]
Witness the mathematic equation of greatness homeostasis
Lab rat, resemble the same symbol as masons, cash that
The wizardary vividly paints imagery, cash stacks
A flash in a frying pan of mysery usually loves company
So I keep a strap, if she come for me, I am blowing her back
Triumphantly, the actual facts finesse pyramid fanatics
While trafficking crack, I seen spinks get beheaded, Unique physique
I had to pad my mistique, divine degree
Felt my aura being breached, retreat, hold up
Back to the drawing board
My shiny sword, cut through the cadence for wages
I design and score
I am so designer lord, sell boulders, sidney
Stiched it to my ironing board, burn you to oblivion (Woo)
Paraben free, terrible being, higher than a red eye flight so who you overseeing


[VERSE 5: Donel Smokes]
All together for every single letter, better my character
Find self tucking on that walker pocket, the derringer
If, we ever up and close, uppercut, comatose
Waxed out money sounds based up on a different note
Thin line, thinner rope, tip-toeing my way through
[(Talking backwards)?], leave demons, I am bout to scave through
Because I ain't got the time for it, ignore it, I must
Burning one knowledge of son, moving forward
And I trust the lust doesn't get the best of me
Got to manouvre carefully, thought the world was ready
But really wasn't prepared for me and my kind
I shine, you do the equivalent
This is what I am dedicated to, No need for membership, see
I reminisce over the doja, days looking over my shoulder
Didn't have to worry much, my older brother was there
Game warfare, fuel in the fire, still
But I can't stop, won't stop building, I never will


[VERSE 6: Krondon]
For probable cause, I probably
Peer pressure had me breaking the law
Berate them all since, 6th grade, bathroom stalls
Kissing girls, madam, miss, I call em Miss Ellis, drawn, my spirit is torn
Scrolls on 16 bars
Not a soul to a sismick, empathy gone, imperial
Echelon, to my enemies carry on, yeah
Comparing chronic, gang is calm, a gang strong
Taking chances that Lance Armstrong made wrong
The bank kept a Brookly trombone and played on
Smoking ounces out over the couch, was counting the sheep then
Bouncing on little bopy but made them all
We didn't sleep, surrounded by the elite
I'm from the sewer deep, not if you from my suites
If you the can't compete
And I just pray the lord care enough to carry me
Apparently, long way from the scale of parakeets
Scary street set, niggas at school scared of me

[VERSE 7: Chace Infinite]
I really see the solidarity
Neccessary to being in unison with universal family and its the
Pointing your existence, we searching for similarities
Between the fabric of dreams and alter realities
People are fabricated to portray a personality
If the image is tainted, then the person is a casualty
Thoughts, relate rapidly, written with such majesty
The author has to be considered at the level of mastery
We don't paint pictures, we sit and chisel the masterpiece
And make it hard for the average to rap after me
Ironically, my chronically despise my typography
The mind is steady minding, eyes capture the photography
A life without monotony, Stylissadine inside the Massadine
Travelling amongst the people, things I never thought I'd see
Appear to me, appeal to me, dreams becoming real for me
Its surreal but how I feel, you can never kill the Infinite G

[VERSE 8: Planet Asia]
Energizer, visualizer, civilizer, city rider
Spider man web internet intertwining
Silver lining, diamond mine to mind of a diamond
Refine and analyze and I am grinding, I was not made for 9 to 5'in
Design a rhyme and two time and 100k display science
The universal giant, mother Will from Xian
Splash bars, Master Fard, black Allah, black Arabia
Plus lessons manifested from a elder's cranium
Open sesame, the recipe is solely language
Invested in me, powers that swift, forever changing
Champions to champs to find a champ, bust in your skully
Champion raps, champion hoodies, woody
Not be the man of the hour, if majority of the niggas in the game
Was really like ours, good question
For this I was chose, I didn't choose, what it do
Just a little something for my nigga Blu(And a 6-pack of Pepsi Cola that always go good with the chitlins, baby)

[Phil Da Agony]
Shit...
But I ain't fucking with them chitlins
The most I'm a do is chicken, bad food'll have your breath kicking
Try a diet like Russell Simmons
Dating vegetarian vegan women drinking water with lemons
Low sodium salt, no pork on your fork
After meals you take a long walk
And stay away from the ballpark franks, you pulling all that rank
At Whole Foods putting fuel in your tank
That's more muscle for the machine
Brussel sprouts, broccoli and string beans
You get your choice of three greens plus a starch to go with it
Committed to the gym keeping your waistline trim
That put a grin all over my face, when you walk in the place
We had ketchup on Sunset, tomato paste
Chicago Summertime at the taste, no time to waste
We don't waste food on our plate, let the haters hate
Twelve-ounce steak, asparagus tips delicious, got me licking my lips
On some LL Cool J shit
No rib-tips, we take tips from the best chefs like Raekwon
Now pass the Grey Poupon, no MSG, no butter on my popcorn
This ain't a pop song, tell 'em

[Planet Asia]
These type of women I sees often, the Trader Joe
All natural juice drinking breezes be at the flea market
Berkeley Bowl, free range chicken and rosemary
Avocado California Rolls fresh jalopy
Yoga girl part agave
Green salad pita supporter, vegan au gratin
High on the calcium, cashews, callaloo and curry
Raw veggies, one hundred percent alkaline
Backrubs while I smoke my berries
You and your chick at Mickey D's ordering Frost McFlurrys
And one thing's for sure you got that (good thing)
That's why I got you pregnant cause your pussy was fertile
I can give it to you tough or take it slow like turtles
So soulful my tofu Whole Foods girl
Butternut squash, maple syrup, semi-succulent
You the one I'm fucking with
My organic supplement, always something healthy in the tupperware
I'm eating from the ground as long as we have an atmosphere
Day to day business, water, lime, maple syrup
Cayenne pepper fast, a ten-day cleansing
And if you eat swine that might fuck up our friendship
You know the God gotta have a Queen in the kitchen

[Krondon]
Missus microwave three day refrigerated meat loaf, tastes homemade
Daily grill diner, potato parmesan and no lactose
Doze in the massage chair reclining
Thousand Island ruffage, turkey stuffing with brown biscuits
Blonde Barbie dolls call 'em muffins
My honey loves mustard, chicken sub Quiznos munching
Veggie dog sauteed onions
Mouth full of Funyuns on the ferris wheel turning
Having so much fun, tummy burning
Hard, a masala make a hungry man follow ya
Right off the edge of the terrace, asparagus marriage
Bad vision fill my belly up with carrots, malnutrition
Cupcake cholesterol, lifting weights
In between the mocha milkshakes and the succulent Salisbury Steak, wait
She got a porcelain plate, cornish and crab cornbread, kosher
Feeling my foreskin, this Corsican's horse butt girlfriend
Gets full of forcing it in
In the end she skips din goes straight to dessert
And tries to feed me what's under that skirt
I leave screaming[Zumbi]
Yo checkout the superb tech, cashin' checks through dialect
Doper than the gold around your neck
This is my manuscript to spit lyrics like fat spliffs
I show the whole damn world my gift
For Paris I'm speakin' upon, powerful just like a pawn
Positioned in the proper placement
Focus like militant deep as concentrational caverns
Devising secret plans on spitting atoms
I verbalize, lust to bust
Just as dangerous as watching Mt. Vesuvius erupt
Corrupt a data disk from the super soul powered slums
I-N-I, Planet Asia make it bump, bump
I'm deep off in the trunk, SWATS call it crunk
The 15 inch whoofers make the beat go thump
I dump clips of pros ? goes
The chillin' is killin' with the illest type flows

[Hook]
"Rap legends presidents felt" -] Nas 'Nas is Like'
"Put us together" -] Mobb Deep 'Survival of the Fittest'
"The outcome is Critical" -] GZA/Genius
"Set it off" -] Jeru The Damaja 'Mental Stamina'

[Planet Asia]
Yo, vocally blessed to beat you into submission
I paddle units which protrude from the underside of trains
Do not touch I'm high voltage like the third electric
Emergency phones needed in every tunnel for this murder method
You're dealing with the armed forces, we wave warm torches
Through the trenches of the onslaughtness
? up next, I'm anticipated
Post my plan is to stay behind my every line stated
Deluxe, eon flux-uate what I pronunciate
Cold verses be lookin' out but y'all people got months to wait
Life as it is baby, Zion I got me flyin' high
My mind's inside music symbolic to I-N-I
This ain't the Sci-Fi Channel
We true and living legends of this beat freak committee
Clash Of the Titans through the vinyl
When we splash the Atlas with the rules of the game
We out the old school and came to drop a jewel on your brain

[Hook]

[Zumbi]
My brother hit me on the game, said that we original man
And we manifested here to spit slang
I thought a minute, and let it sink, deep like the Titanic
We wider than the ocean of Atlantic
Pacifical mythical styles in the west it's gettin' wild
I'm chillin' like the Sphinx upon the Nile
Reverberating, why is you hatin' hip hop we creatin?
Across the desert sands we be bakin', my melanin
The key to lock rock spots and flocks
Walk the rugged avenue with my B-Boy bop
It's evolution toss a pebble at the devil and smile
I'm rebellion while propelling freestyles

[Planet Asia]
From the bottom to the top I made a lot of em drop
Hip hop's the lifestyle of urban civilians and even cops
No it don't stop, once again another classic fantastic rap shit
That'll make y'all MCs wanna practice
How to lock shit down like Daddy As, I blaze mics for days
Hit the page light stage and burn Sage, then engage
This ain't a faze or some played out gimmick
That's worth to ? for the fact that most of y'all cats is timid, vivid
Views of the do and don't don't apply
To the uncompromising Planet Asia, Zion I
Worldwide renown, zones of the chosen few
Verbal shots I cipher rhymes to leave holes in you

[Hook](Sample)
"Our skin and blood, the iron bars of confinement
But fear not. All flesh decays
Death turns all to ash
And thus, 'Death Frees Every Soul'."

[Planet Asia]
My body is a Bentley
My soul is God meaning you rolling wit Allah if you riding wit me
The mystery is death to most
When niggas get clapped and come back believing in ghosts
Some niggas come back and don't remember shit except the incident
Some niggas come back and turn religious
They say the flesh is a just a vessel for the spirit
And the brain is antenna to teleport thoughts to ya vision
But in the mean time we living
The criminal life until they gas us in prison
Back to ether, ashes and urns
Now you just a container of dirt sitting on the speaker
Or somewhere in the Ocean scattered
I was taught heaven or hell was understanding 'Mind Over Matter'
So what's the meaning of death? Nothingness
Most ask by the 85 are like the 25th alphabet
RIP, sent to your doorstep
We miss you very much but your soul is free
From all the pain and the suffering we all must share
So save a spot for the family till we all upstairs

(Sample)

[Sick Jacken]
My body is a six deuce
My soul is old like a classic from all the shit I've been thru
My conscious is infinite tho'
Now I know so I'm taking it slow
I'm 732-to-life and it's taking its toll
Secure my bloodline wit seven seeds
And I put my stories in palm scrolls to bone and skulls
Is all that's left, I'm shine death
I came close but I guess it wasn't time yet
And I wander thru the ages like this
Believing life is a hell and my death would be bliss
While religion promises a heaven
I enjoy what I have now wit no guilt cuz that's what I'm giving
Ashes to ash trays and dust smash brains
I'm just a lost soul navigating path ways
I gotta get it right cuz we're in the last days
Soon we'll meet death, the mysteries of black age

(Sample)[Planet Asia]
Aiyyo, ("One of my favorites") military minded
I strategize plots to knock knots in hot spots
Inhalin earth through my snot box
Raps is G's, no more scrap, we takin, master thieves
I jam-pack the walls to the furthest capacity
Once again, Planet Asia ain't a damn thing changed
Still when it comes to microphones I leave my victims found slain
Cuz I'm trained, to aim precise at bank shots at blank spots
My vocal cord's a sword that slice your sweater to a tank top
And when it comes to battlin, y'all cats ain't even worthy
Cuz y'all be dead pullin styles like stolen cars out in Jersey
You're fuckin wit the most confident
Bulletproof relief brief cheif
Holler at me cuz I conquered it
Canines cannot tense through Peanut Butter pepper narcotics
Marvelant trees and my duffel bag passin through check up
Still in your sector low post on all posts
I'm a prophet wit much accomplished thinkin
Fuck stoppin, this it, you know the fuckin concept
Deuce version of Definiton of Ill I reflect

[Hook]
"The definition of ill I reflect" [Planet Asia]
Planet Asia, mad livin invasion up in the set
"The definition of ill I reflect"
Aiyyo y'all cowards know the time, y'all best to give us respect
"The definition of ill I reflect"
Us Cali-style niggas wettin off like tecs
"The definition of ill I reflect" "Of ill I reflect"

[Madlib]
My lyrical spasm, havin em, grabbin em
For beat, stabbin them when I'm jabbin
Black flaggin cuz rappin you're lackin it
Rip your abdomen cuz we ain't havin no babblin
Many miles I'm travelin (Asia!)
Now I'm never lackin in
Raggin it taggin it, action it niggas always askin
When what where why, I reply wit the facts and then
Go smoke some bowls, drop some soul where PB Wolf in it
Takin back to the basics
From October 24th to May 6
Wit that watered down stage sick
Here's an anitdote for them fake cats
Who think they rhyme great but don't innovate on they own plate

[Planet Asia]
Yo yo, I'm the definition of ill
Still time for you to recognize the real
My text to slide words like this
Observe, I leave your fuckin fisherman hat curved
Still glistenin, rap nerd black to the third
From North America to the wilderness where Lucifer occurred
Earth my birth record has no set, yes
His majesty, makin the owner of his global concept
Send herb from Raspa, not go where the knowledge is kept
Follow my steps, on stretch budu hex your verbals like curse
Mathematically I connect even in auto reverse
It's for the seven y'all, live like my five degree
Resurrected back wit the power that can set your soul free
Remember for infinity mentally be the OG of the art
Lookin for me the MC I hold the key
And we sharp, all across the map like sharks
You's think you can catch after dark up at Frank H. Park
This analyst'll never rest till I manifest dest
Like rather test the definition of ill I reflect
This analyst will never rest till I manifest dest
Like rather test the definition of ill I reflect

Look, this is the moment that you waited for
Dick Swan and [Asia] get in the booth start cocking the gauge
We with the D-to-the-I-lated
For all the cats that hated, the kid is back to bring you crack
Ounce for ounce, looking for the bills to count
Fuck the small shit, I’m looking for the real amounts
Swiss accounts, first name mispronounced
Kieda’s the name, yank dudes out of the game
Out the league, raw cats stop ya feed
Drop to knees, Make niggas cock to please
Thirty-to-life, I might have to blurry your sight
So worry tonight, the nigga with the dirtiest knife is Ras’
Dudes thought we was stuck in the past, something to blast
Do it right in front of your staff, still coming with the coldest shit
We unload the clip, so peep game I got blows to spit
Yeah

[Verse 2 - Evidence]
Aiyo, it’s my turn
Dilated Agents, Evidence, Cali’s long awaited
Keep shades drawn until the sun’s faded
Night-time shit, forty-city tour equipped
Two bus entourage, long trips with full clips
Keep a daily dosage of the medicine: Never O-D, O-G!
Do it like Geo, when I’m toasted, post me up
Close up cats is out of focus
Dilated Peoples done undid your vocals, man
Stop fronting like where you from is a hot spot
Only chalk seen on the sidewalks, from hopscotch
Manley vox-box got top notch compression
Lock and load, rock and roll, stop the session

[Verse 3 - Rakaa]
This is the moment that you waited for, Weatherman and Rak’
Get in the booth, and start cocking the Glocks
With Rasco and Planet [Asia], we manhandle the stage
My clique’s in back to click the klack
For self-defense, for revenge and retaliation
I roll with Blacks, Browns, crazy Whites, rowdy Asians
Vacation, Pakalolo, Maui-Wowie blazing
The deadly Dilated, with the killer Cali Agents
Central Valley to the Bay, true to that L.A. shit
Rakaa’s still repping Rock Steady, Zulu Nation
Viva ancients, rhythm and mathematics
Today this edutainment is beautiful black magic
We like to bomb this medicine up, like Thomas Edison
But it could be dangerous, best handled by veterans
We not ones to kick down doors, so let us in
Record labels feeding us pork, filling our head with sin

[Verse 4 - Planet Asia]
Yo, it’s the next edition, Dilated Agents defensive
The forefront of the coast, the great wonders of my existence
Stand firm like, pagan holidays and Black’s eating chitlins
The master plan of a military invention
This is medicine with no subscription, positive pulp fiction
Depictions of a desperado lets the ghost whisper
With a host of victims, toast to the most official
Unloading missiles on your soldiers, holding loaded pistols
Cold a hit of the medicine, revival time when I rhyme
Suspect niggas already know the mission
Acknowledge the god, observe, learn and listen
Got you spinning off my shine, like the Earth in the Sun’s distance
Dilated Agents, we the greatest, ‘Cali-hop’
All-stars, true to the game, but still about our paper
Choose your weapon, grab your favorite sword
The time is now this is the moment that you waited for

[Outro]
“Whoever’s out there to rep... Planet Asia...Rasco

Yeah, we gon' be a bunch of little Fonzi's
And y'all all know what Fonzi was...cool
That's right (set it off)

[Talib Kweli, Planet Asia]
We in the air like natural and mystic
Or smoke when the spliff's lit
Don't bitch if you get your shit split
Cuz you Limp like Bizkit
Spit and focus, formats my motto
In minutes and in precice, this is vintage
Y'all know it only takes a second for mics to get blown
You nice, you get known
Hear me twice it's the clone ass nigga wit no life of his own
This is it, as Planet sets flames to the journal in your section
Wit Kweli from Reflection Eternal
Big up my nigga Hi-Tek steady rockin the spot
These niggas styles so dead that they startin to rot
We got the market on stock
Wit hot drops and big bookings
How we leave shows shooken up from Fresno to Brooklyn
New York City cost of livin, type high
We type fly, roll a white guy
Light it up like Manhattan in the night sky
Word, and it's no Mister Nice Guy
Show you how we slice pies
Divided in between the scheme of nighttime

[Hook--Planet Asia, Talib Kweli]
"Don't let up"
We keep it movin with the movement
Beats by my brethren, 427
"Don't let up"
Keep on making the street songs with the beat strong
Each one, we gotta teach one
"Don't let up"
It's Planet Asia and Talib Kweli
Shoutouts to J-F, my click, and that nigga JOEY T.!!!
"Don't let up"
Blackstar to Cali Agents, these cats are amazing
Most rappers are foul and flagrant

[Planet Asia]
I keep rhymes on floss, retardedly smart
Wit fine-printed sheets folded
A book of such pages, a nine inch octavolts
It's cultural warfare where shots fire rapidly
Cats plastically resign drastically
C'mon, up in the house you got the mic
Veteran slight, better than all your favorite rappers
Guess I'm about to make some cheddar
Than y'all, should fall abrupt
Once the measuring starts
I spit bars in twenty-fours and cut vocals without editing
I'm long-winded, styles intrigue through these vaccuum lungs
Althought my family be toking major trees
My performance forever powerful
These beats got me spittin Frank Sinatra's
And wilding out on bank accountants
It's chronic slaughter, ionic orders doric
Now dine a novel to the face, I lace cats with the prehistoric
Medicinal metaphoric assorted for clientele
My whole crew circulating just like Japanese tourists
And I clap MC's flawless
Know what I'm sayin?
I stays blunted with about a hundred thousand choruses
And crush mode, baby up those stats
I used to bust flows back in the day
I'll probably rush you
Like fuck those raps!
Pitch black, spittin at the park
Seventy, perform the benches, triple-loaded in the dark
I started noticing my glow in the dark was right
From then on, I was always able to rock the mic unordinary from yours
Legendary till you bury the sword
Marry ya broad, scary how I carry the gorge
Of every applaud, I'm heavy like a 70's Ford
For the cheddy and I'm ready and raw

[Hook--Talib Kweli, Planet Asia]
"Don't let up"
Killin the track, chill in the back
Until it's time to hit the stage and begin healing the raps
"Don't let up"
We all inside of the place
With big bitches, step to this and end up dividing the cake
"Don't let up"
You gotta hear us, so we slow it up
Let me see your fist, throw it up, every spot we blow it up
"Don't let up"
We keep it movin with the movement
Beats by my brethren, 427

[Talib Kweli]
My man Planet Asia already broke down the science to my name
I speak to the silent and the tame
And the violent in the brain
I'm the pilot in the plane
I'm still Soundbombing shit
Dominant when I be flowin
Cats get broken like promises
Fuck the politics, my partnership with artists who
Put their heart in it, that's why my crew spit the hardest shit
For the art of it, we start the shit and get it HYPE
Cuz hearing me and this man here rock together, yo it's like
Mixing Northern Lights from the Bay
With Yard weed from Jamaica
Or the best from the Knicks with the best of the Lakers
We the creators, never the imitators of the slave traders
All y'all niggas is just cartoons put to music like Fantasia
From the planet of Brooklyn to Planet Asia
I'll pull your card, I'm all around, I see your hand plus I'll raise ya
Like children, just for the sake of smacking you when you outta place
You don't get hits, niggas make errors, try to run home
You out at the plate (YOU'RE OUT!)
I make wack niggas light my L then I put it out on they face
From New York to California, I'll run you all out of the state
Of mind you currently residin in
The difference is you try to win
You believe what they sayin, you on your knees like you prayin
You ain't got to sweat the ice and money, they know people promise me
With one rhyme I probably could break down your whole psychology
Niggas is Hollywood like the church of Scientology
If I drop African thought
They probably would lie and say it's Greek philosophy

[Hook--Planet Asia, Talib Kweli]
"Don't let up"
Get rowdy if ya feelin it
We all about killin it
Ya feelin it? Well get with it then
"Don't let up"
Killlin the track, chill in back
Till it's time to hit the stage and bring healing to rap
"Don't let up"
We still down for the cause
With or without fame, stickin to the old school laws
"Don't let up"
You gotta hear us, so we slow it up
Let me see your fist, throw it up, every spot we blow it up[Planet Asia]
Double dutch intro
Sergio Tacchini on the pimp though
Flavor on a digital clip note
Spliff smoking rich folks
Sweaters in flats, where we at?
Titanium vaults, colorful thoughts
My words do somersaults
Thunderbolt crime rhyme quotes
You ain't old enough to be the goat
You know I be the most flamboyant last Mohican
If you ain't gonna mash for nothing, then mash for me then
Off top, you can feel the realness, red loops
I electrocute, holding my testicles across stage
B-boy shit, it ain't a skit
My error is golden, we bow down to the pharaoh
The chosen, architect, of the outer world
Its honorable whenever I spit
So there's no need to ask what time is it
I'm in time, on time, all the time
And what you call fucked up might just be the grind
Don't try to read my mind, read the signs
...
Shit is universal, with no rehearsal
Money all over the world, nigga
...
It feels good don't it?
Madlib, Planet Asia, California and we on it[Talib Kweli]
Yea
That's what I'm talking about
S-A-S, size ain't shit, never that
Strong Arm Steady, Talib Kweli
Yea

[Hook x2: Talib Kweli]
Niggas gettin caught in the trap
For the cash, it's the drugs; basketball; or the rap
There's more to us than that
We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
You know you best to fall back

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
I'm dealing with, nothing but facts, when I spit it, though
You niggas superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the pole
Candle light, flickers so bright, my silhouette can kick a sicker flow
And spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance
I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants
I spit the shit to make a motherfucker call it a night
I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like
I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute
I play this well to win it, you go to Africa, like Dave Chappelle, you finished
Cause your prehistoric raps is boring, the number of whack rappers soaring
Like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions
These niggas meek, their lyrics weak, and their beats is corporate
They try snitching on records their mouths is leaking faucets
Dripping them over system than, Chinese water torture
Ripping a series of events, more unfortunate than Lemony Snicket

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
Medallions mind, bless the mic for the gods, teach the blind
Plus get a piece of mine release your minds for each design
Baby food for thought, rappers not coonin' for sport
Due to these pork eatin niggas of sort
Yo you's a fuckface, burnt out loser that's always up late
Planet Asia the revolutionary slash nut case
A witchcraft black magic, data load up computers
A spread the message wrote to you where when I show illusions
If all y'all niggas is killas then how you write your records
How'd you find the time stop lying, your minds' infected
There's only a few, and I ain't saying niggas don't put it down from you town
I'm talkin bout you
Yea the fake dude promotin propaganda
And open on some fanna, and out right, snitching on them cameras
Planet Asia, gold chain black bandanas low
Steady Gain Klick Klack rang rang, there they go

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Phil Da Agony]
Just a high skip and a jump
Away from getting everything that I could possibly want
And prostitutes front
Get a 4 bar on the roster, scratch that
I'm talkin about a full roster of raps
Monsters that rap, buzzed out ?? check the cadence of the frequency
Uniquely, we strong arms strategically
Easily I twist the ?? killa cali ??
Back alleys burnin backwoods in danelis or
He probably with Kweli, out in BK
We make it easy for the DJ's, like instant replays
Conversation by the buttons, I talk and touch something
Straight shots of the Louis he flew me out to London
Crunchin numbers flippin more dough, like siccisero
Next thing you know we kissin ya ho, without the mistletoe
Strong arm steady, agony can ???, fill the rigglies
The Big League niggas is dropping indies
Let's go

[Hook x2]

[Talib Kweli]
Talib kweli, right about now
This what I'm feelin right about now
And I invite you all to check it out wit me
Lets go!

S'like

[Hook x2][Planet Asia]
Affiliation like, Dilated Peoples

"Watch your ear drums pop"
"Watch your ear drums pop, got this rap shit locked"

"Planet Asia, ain't a damn thing changed" [Planet Asia]

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
The methods of melodic torture, mic mastery
I'm locally accepted, worldwide respected
So gimmie mines and meet your deathwish
Dead at the throat like floatin wit your neck slit
Be gone, I'm way beyond
My mind shines harder than your necklace
I just violate the streets until I Dilate the Peoples
Posse cut, kill the track, annihilate the sequel
Trigger-happy, anxious to earn a stripe
Like it was just put on
Initiation means death, burn the mic now meet your escort
If the shot's rusted, hot sauce for all you block busters
Duck it, you're fuckin wit the spot rushers
Bustin wit brand new artillery cocked
Straight out the metal shop, to catch you up close, dead on the spot
There goes your manhood
Mad Max, Terror your Dome for canned goods
Blaze you wit the heat, destroy my conscience
For the backward, easin up ain't in the plans
I leave MC's wit no stands
Ill conventions so deep in thoughts, the fans labeled it trance

"Iriscience ya'll" [Iriscience]
"MC Iriscience" [Iriscience]
"Rakaa you don't rhyme fair" [Iriscience]

[Verse 2: Iriscience]
Aiyyo we hit it festivals, and we hit it the nightclubs
We hit it like Brad Pitt did it to Fight Club
I love it and live it
If you want it, then come and get it
I'm like Show and AG, or Alomar how I spit it
It's the highly-developed, well-equipped intelligent
You're a target if you're soft, pastel, or delicate
I'm bold cuz everything goes at pro caliber
A top competitor, a worldclass traveller
Spell-the-name-right.com, check the site
Like they could check the date on a dime from satellites
I move like Coltrane, pushin a blue tray
Rakaa's my name, style Fatal like Hussein
Wit Planet Asia, Defari, and Everlast
Phil Tha Ag and Ev deliever the weather fast
Joey Chavez, and a butcher named Babs
Dilated, now take that shit back to the lab

"Man listen" [Defari]
"From L.A. and it's finest" [Iriscience]
"Defari" [Defari]

[Verse 3: Defari]
They wanna jack who?
Step up and I'll dump
Invade and face the rage of a twelve gauge pump
Yo chump, I'm not that guy, my name's Defari
I roll wit the fo' sho' logo, the open eye
Dilated, heavy rotated, Golden Stated
So many dream of the sound that me and Ev created
Everybody wanna be rhymin wit two left feet
That's like a cripple man in lane five at the track meet
You wishin on a star but you lookin at the sun
I be the one who takes it so serious, it's more than fun
Pro sport wit a bottle of Crown and quart of Guiness
The ink fill up the paper in a matter of minutes
Whether from Brooklyn or Venice
I travel wit mental fitness
Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did this
So quit it, quit wit the nonsense, you harmless
Leave the hip hop alone and get your fix from a pharmacy

"Everlastin fresh" [Defari]
"Whitey Ford brings the devastating mic control" [Everlast]

[Verse 4: Everlast]
I read the New Testament and gave it up for Lent
All the places I went just to pay my rent
Used to keep me bent, on a ritual daily
Cock my hammer, spit a comet like Halley
I'll buck a .380 on ones that act Shady
I'm original like Grady, check my Sanford, Son
You know you ain't the one that rep peckerwood status
I'll bust that ass, keep your eyes on the floor
What you comin here for, son you know the law
Let's take it back to the house, slide off your blouse
Lift up your skirt and expose your panties
For the world to see, you can't rep it like me
I'm Communist, terrorist, vandalist
Catalyst, scandalous, masacous, never miss battalist
You must be crazy, or just plain dumb
You might catch a beatdown now where I come from
It's like that

"Crescent Heights, get the name right" [Phil]
"You know my mothafuckin name" [Phil]

[Verse 5: Phil Tha Agony]
Phil Tha Agony, a superhero
Creatin miracles, Analyze This like Robert DeNiro
Wit your air-tight vaccuum lungs
Got your stupid ass ? ?, chewin gum, bitin your tongue
Bleedin, what is it that you're really needin
Is it fresh air to breathin, a bank account so plenty of cheese in
Take into consideration, wit every situation that you're facin
Analyze the operation
What's the function? Who does the label work, who does the paper work?
Who's the president behind the desk, reclinin the best
Too many fake fraudulent artist, ignoramusus
Gettin famous-es, tryin to steal my whole name in this
That's why every move is documented
It's the unprescedented, rhymes that I invented
R-rated, Phil Tha Agony and Dilated
Crescent Heights, we're stealin your height, violated

"'76 born bomb lyricist" [Evidence]
"Evidence...got another sound mission" [Defari]

[Verse 6: Evidence]
Yo ya'll, my shit is timeless
A clock wit no hands, a hourglass wit no sand
My lifespan's been written before anyone cloths or ribbon
I've started their path, but what I've said just passed
The labcat's back, that's why I feel like I've been chose
To rise to occasions wit hits like Pete Rose
Speak to myself, but once I say when
No mistakes allowed, sketch my letters in pen
Permanent ink, unleaded gas tank ready to drink
Open all flows in perfect border insync
Total chaos, mass confusin
Just entered the playoffs, yo my team's not losin

"Platform, ultimate" *repeat to end*[Hook: Planet Asia] (Motion Man)
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We puttin' in work, Kutmasta Kurt break down the bass
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We diggin' in crates, makin' papes all across the states

[Planet Asia]
Who wanna go against the hard knock trife? Demonstration of self
Fuck what ya heard, that' how the Yard rocks mics
I stretch perfecto, poetry penetratin' through your chest blow
Wrestlin' with the written, straight spittin' about to explode
It's ocknaughtin, and I shall never be forgotten
Rappers be actin' hard but really soft just like cotton
Once I switch gears, I gets down off the cadence
My train of thought brave, rhymes with all kinds of changes
I bust faster, fuckin' with Kurt the Kutmasta
Touch my microphone is the reason you'll get your ass whipped
Razor sharp precision slash it, to get the cash quick
I heard the track murder my mental and then I smashed it
Straight coastin' - Motion Man, bam, it's settled
I'm hot shit meltin' through the motherfuckin' ghetto
Blazin', mainstream, makin' shit happen
As the first real West Coast emcee to turn Platinum

[Hook: Planet Asia] (Motion Man)
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We puttin' in work, Kutmasta Kurt break down the bass
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)

Pullin' all nighters cause we writers and the joints don't stop
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
And if ya hot ya hot, and if ya not ya not

[Motion Man]
Biochemical, biodegradable, biological
But not bio-sexual partna, bioracial
Switch up tones on you, smack up your facial
Chameleon, tryin' to make a million and it's on
I'm a lizard, mixed with Mother Nature's form of a blizzard
Salmonella scaly rain, swing the mic like a wizard
Don't mess with smart kids off alcohol with dunce hats to fit you all
Return siris for the whole street brawl
Send dirty ashey rappers back to the studio, like babies they crawl
Like snakes they shed, I'm flyin' that head
Doin' failure, sets of push-ups after sex in the bed
I'm ready to roll again - dip-dip-dip-doo-da, insert it in
I be strokin' like McGwire and Sosa to bypass Roger Maris
And get a day off like I'm Ferris
Bueller, Bueller, Bueller - absent from the scene
Rappers hear that avalanche is comin', won't proceed
I'm a mixer, form of a blender, add in many phrases
Chop it up, rotatin' a solid into a lyrical liquid
Get up to the plate and switch hit with a verbal bat to swing up
Knock a dent and I won't ding up, after I rip
Leavin' the mic smellin' like Old Gold from my top lip
My cut up at you like clippers to fade ya
Sit in the chair as I edge your head with Planet Asia
You might be disappointed when sharp cuts
Connect to your forehead, expose your black head

[Hook: Planet Asia] (Motion Man)
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We puttin' in work, Kutmasta Kurt break down the bass

Pullin' all nighters cause we writers and the joints don't stop
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)

[Motion Man]
What's your last request you nappy Fred Williams chest
You not Shaft nigga, you more like Jimmy Walker skinny
Michael Evans, tight denim, lookin' out for Penny
I leave rappers like Florida Evans sayin "Damn!"

[Planet Asia]
With years of experience I reach my destinations
And now I'm gettin' by just off my high expectations
Dirty to the core, ghetto score to the symphony
Contemporary hip-hop crews you gets no sympathy
In this feel I follow, no woman or man or even dollar
And I put that on my next heart beat, all down the bottle
My peoples out to touch live L.A. ey yo I doubt there's
Another emcee that could probably fuck with me out there
No doubt yeah, this be that real hip-hop shit
To make y'all motherfuckers run out quick, lookin' to cop this
Back again just to slap out your taste
Na na na, face to face we came to shake down the place

[Hook: Planet Asia] (Motion Man)
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We puttin' in work, Kutmasta Kurt break down the bass

And if ya hot ya hot, and if ya not ya not[Verse 1]
My ways in actions reflect greatness, stand on my square sacred
Serious grill, this is the hand that writes the hatred
I scroll the tool up, your flow is tool up
But truly on your shit, sandals and ancess is suit up
Vibe on my scripture, ride to the pictures I paint
Even the deaf, dumb, and blind can’t intertwine with this one
I’m too grown to do what shawty do
The cook up cost more than what the snorty do
Shoot your face in the particles with a 22
From the sleeve of the custom hitting pocket of naughty goose
Why would I lie to you? that’s something that I’m too fly to do
I’m on some ?
Lord forgive me for the gluttony
But not having a dollar to feed my family, it’s just what it mean

[Hook x2]
This is legendary status, it ain’t a small time thing
Money machine, use it, the faces of the dollar could talk, I swear
Telling me to stay prepared, stand on the grind
It’s money to be made, everywhere

[Verse 2]
Shout-out to Frank H., Fink White, Hinton Center I be center
Summers and winters, all the fly shit that I remember
Fucking with me on this mic, it ain’t a man that I know
Since selling dope out the brownies and a bag of condos
One verse will have you all stuck
Might hold a hand and kick a can to get my balls sucked
Parental advisory, I suggest we’re dealing with rhymes of chef
When I’m beasting, I’m releasing all kinds of stress
You fooly ass rappers is making it too easy for me
I’m on my fly thug shit, that’s easy money
With enough brethren, that’s rough around the edges
Hit the ruffle up some feathers, and it’s nothing, it’s whatever
Lord forgive me for the gluttony
But not being a G-O-D on my cipher just what it mean
Still sucker free, niggas can’t fuck with me
And not having no money to feed my family, fuck the police

[Hook][Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Fuck rappers, ban 'em like flavored Dutch Masters
Your cuts after I listen to 'em with much laughter
Champagne slush my campaign Krush
Grooving, powder Peruvian, black Nubian manoeuver
I'm like Max Julien to Cougars, with more racks than Hooters
Wasn't for rap I'd probably be head of the pack
Pass the straps to shooters
Pockets lacking Gouda, that's when niggas pack the Ruger
I caught a cool run, my crew runs shit, Hilltop Hustling logic
Rock your pillbox, I still got a couple of projects
Niggas can't fuck with my accomplishments
The Don is supreme sonic, Ebonic, speaking in phonics
Reminiscing on hand to hand, running from big knots
Now it's G&Gs all over my silk top
Amongst trappers, in the cuts we clutch clappers
Ain't another nigga die for nigga, fuck rappers
[Verse 2: Willie The Kid]
Fuck rappers, niggas 'posed to been dead
Bled through the Band-Aid, I'm Pinhead
Hell raising, I lay blades Clive Barker and Wes Craven
My neck's craving, I savor the flavor
It's savoir faire save my fear for the saviour
For all the rest of y'all I got a bomb, Jaeger
Especially you rappers, fuck all of y'all
Fast forward then backwards, sick chiropractor
I'm hot like the sand out in Cairo, a pyro
Maniac, a klepto, braniac I'm zany
Pop it like a Xanie, declare war, Cheney
My ho is like Claire Huxtable, hard lustable
All these rap niggas gassed up, combustible
Feminine internet niggas, fucking weirdos
Me and Planet Asia like Albert Anastasia
But we Asiatic, original fabric
Never fabricated, ain't got it, never had it
Used to play ball now you want to be a rapper

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
You know what, fuck rappers
We puff puff past 'em, turn niggas to blunt ashes
Consider me retro and vintage
I'm blowing dro out in Venice
A role model and my role is simple
That's captivate your soul and control your mental
Teach you how to hold a pistol
Go to Nobu and order the whole menu
Glow like I wrote it with a solid gold pencil
G shit, cause thorough is how I keep it
Niggas know, every block every borough, it ain't a secret
Flow rare like the first hair on a Mona Lisa
Check your intellect cause you're in front of a teacher
I roll the kind of reefer that'll give you amnesia
Don't believe it well roll up a gram and have a damn seizure[Verse 1:]
Don't mean a thing if it ain't got that
Follow the leader flow, midget jumping out my top hat
I'm going hood, going platinum in the projects
Diamond at the neighborhood, liquor store
Passport, poetry, dough, the passion and pope
Ask about acrobatical show, mechanical
Mathematical, I'm back telling it
Back on my element, that settles it
To peoples played out you never did
Classic ill niggas my claw
Fall back before the bread I was bred to be the boss
Talk right in exact
Freedom of death minus the word that wisdom reflect
This ain't the checks
These are the words that I manifest
It goes yes yes y'all
30,000 dollars of Remy bottles is staring at me
Nigga let's ball, god could never be a mystery, you feel me?
Cause in the heavens and the earth he always was, forever will be

[Hook]
I came to wake you up, the shit is fake as fuck
Fools is breaking up, cause they ain't caking up
All it takes is a little faith
Before you blow dough you better off investin some real estate
Stack it and just wait couple months you'll be great
Same as a nigga holdin weight
Ain't no joking when it's dough to make
I keep a soldier face
This is life in the golden state

[Verse 2:]
Only thing women respect is dollars
Even neglect scholars
Bunch of evil visions as baby mamas
Pimps patrol like piranhas, renegades wander
They end up choosing with honors
I'm just a don of all genres
Best known for throwing molotov bars and flesh eating acid at your armor
Fans get it twisted with my first shit but I was in training
I'm just a thug with esoteric verses
That'll clack out with you
Cop, cook, count, Bag it up
And distribute the product from the crackhouse with you
Splashing with more fashion than Fairfax
Raw dog like when I bareback tracks, tropical airmax
I'm not the one to share my snacks
These labels gotta pay me in racks, because the belt is black
And for the fact the fans never felt me slack
Honestly, it's nothing I lack
Now what's fucking with that, got hundreds of these up in the hat
It's like back to back phantoms and a couple lac's
