[Anyway, it doesn't matter much how you feel
You know what you got to do, I'm here to do it
How about you?]

E-40:
Our age, five-years-old
We were young bucks
Scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub
Babysitter would send you to bed
But she would make me stay up
So she could give the young playa some viscious head uh
Early symptoms of
Time of nightway
Gigantic factor from the
Caukenis bitch tamer
Some had it all though
But less unfortunate
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose
And I had a Huffy
You owned a green machine
Three different lunch pails
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails
We grew up in the church together nigga
Sunday school
Now I heard you off into jackin nigga
That ain't even cool
I used to be conned, racked, fucked around
And ripped bad
Barking up on the wrong tree
Talking about runnin up in my past

[Mac Mall]
Niggas have hateful thoughts
But they stop me from strivin
Suckas be shakin salt
All in his gameful so find
Some fools be gettin crossed
Victims of faultiness
Man all that drama you come with
I swear you on some shit
Whether it's morphine or cocaine
Doja or doggfood
They had these marks for Tre and Max
Fuckin off my high breakin rules
You got ya P's mixed up
You ain't no pimp
You's a phoney
I spit for major mix
While you make tapes for ya homie
And then you work up tha nerve
To speak foul words
The pimp, a traitor, we instigators
That's why I wrote this verse
For every youngster with his mind on his meal
Young playa just chill
And take a look at what these fakers call real
Nigga

[Big Mike]
I trust no man
Cuz man will let you down every time
That's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme
Cuz I've seen better times
And I've seen worser days
When some of my so called friends
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say
I quench my thirst today
With righteous thoughts of mind
Cuz righteous thought of mind will leave mark ass niggas far behind
I seen it every time
They come and go
That's why I drop to my knees
And ask god to distinguish friend from foe
And what do you know
By the time morning comes I can see the light
And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene
Countin' greens
Straight from H-town to New Orleans
New human beings puttin it down like a mic or not
Replace the slot open up shop
We 'bout to make it hot
Stop
With ya devilish doins
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know

[8ball]
Listen
I'm tryin to tell you my nigga to watch cha back
And trust few
Cause ain't no nigga gon watch ya back for you like you
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust
See let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make
Don't want no bustas around me
Playa hatin or actin fake
Don't ever be wantin nobody to get to close
I don't know if it's effects of
From the marijuana that got me more than trippin
See nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone?
See, my partners who used to ride with me
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll?
Maybe they will, maybe they won't
Who is to say what a nigga will do
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help you
See what I'm sayin, listen to me and see if you can dig this
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people recieve ends
Now all of a sudden I'm actin funny because my moneys loaned
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin you don't already know
Personal business, you got to watch who you friends is

[MJG]
I'm thinking about hard times
Freeing my mind
Who in the fuck goin be my crutch?
Holdin me up, helpin me out
Makin sure that I stay in touch
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to?
When I be low on my cash
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin bout kickin my ass?
Who is my friends who is my foes?
Who do I ask, when I want to know
Somethin about somethin but I don't know nothin
My ignorance be keepin me out in the cold
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride?
In somebody elses car
How do I get from point A to B if B is just to far?
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone?
Who's goin to give me the permission to make a decision
To come up in they house and live
When will I drive a BMer takin my clothes to the cleaner
How can I know
Will I forever be payin my dues, will I forever be singing the blues?
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin to lean
Know what I mean?
When I be needin some justification
Stuck in the fuckin same location
Who is the friend that is helpin me?
Who is the busta thats hurtin me?
Who can I trust?
Will you be there when the goin is tough?
Will I be hangin with dick in the dust?
Who wanna share my load when it's too heavy to carry?
Or will I go crazy pullin the load alone?
Constantly gettin my hustle on
When will I finally see, kinda suspect
Or even actually know
Who is my real friend thick and the thin?
And who in the fuck is the foe?

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know...[E-40](Richie Rich)
I'm really not all that sure
Bout when things is finna mature
So let me find me a nigga with a grip
And hit his ass quick with one of them licks
(What's the definition of a lick?)
Taking a niggas shit
(Hey put that on sumthin)
I put that on The Click, The Click
Back to fuckin work one of the homies jus got dusted
Time to do some dirt, uhh, I never trusted
Them bustas shot him in the shirt, dead on arrival
Now the town is funking, it's called survival
What y'all wanna do? They got us skunked
(Well if uhh, we can just uhh) if it was a fifth we'll all be drunk
I'm heated, them niggas cheated, played me false
We had a meetin, shit 'posed to been squashed
I noticed one killa on the double dribble and set him up y'all
She likes the Monie in the Middle, play tetherball
Thick ass bitch, high yellow city-slicker
Scarecrow creepin Southern bitches, aka Posie Pussyfictious

[Spice 1]
Nigga been holdin guts, but shit on hisself and a funky bill
Pullin out bills, frontin on material shit
That's when I get to killin shit (killin shit)
And settin 'im up and havin 'im catchin a couple of slugs
Sl-uh sl-uh slugs, trynta fuck with savage thug
Pistol pop in they ass, see niggas be gettin this twisted
It's that bitch that killed ya
Took all your money peeled ya
Seven niggas bust in the room with AK's
While a nigga be puttin on his jimmy
All of a sudden they shoot up your Vuitton
Before you can hit the broccoli
See money-a-made that nigga, that nigga didn't make that money
Left them niggas jacked up, and the bitch she macked him
He's a busta, punk ass nigga, y'all know the streets
That's why that nigga naked layin dead in between some bloody sheets
It's just a part of the game he didn't feel
Bitches will kill, fuck a nigga, out his last d-uh dollar bill
You don't know that ho main that bitch can't be trusted
Dusted and di-motherfuckin-sgusted

[Hook: E-40]
Some cold hearted shit
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Whacha'll wanna do, whacha'll wanna do
Cold hearted bitches
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Whacha'll wanna do, I never trusted them bustas
Some cold hearted shit
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
I never trusted them bustas
And it's them cold hearted nigga
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Dusted and disgusted

[E-40]
Let's let of some two or threes on the other side of t-uh-town
Draw the attention on the other s-uh-side of town (other side of town)
And wait for the po-po shift to change, ghetto shootin range
Revenge on the r-uh-rebound, war games
Droughts, ouch, lost clientele but I will prevail
By sellin the broccoli dank instead of the crack cocaine
Try not to steal narcotics
When these punk MC's and bitches be the reason why
The smoke be comin up out the chop, with my nigga 'Pac

[2Pac]
Dear God, can you forgive me? My future's lookin sick
I'm in my rag hittin switches I'm suspicious of these bitches
I keep on, calllin, but ain't nobody pickin up
I think she's stallin, this evil bitch is tryin ta set me up
Came all alone if it's on then it's on
Where's my motherfuckin chrome, only jealous niggas roam
It's a war zone (war zone) but I'm a man so with gun in hand
I'm on my way to see this ho you know the fuckin plan
Can't understand, but the things ain't the same
You could die over these bitches if you slippin in the game
Niggas gang bang, but bitches gang bang too
Give up that good thang, and put that pistol to your brain
If you a smart figure, don't have no love in your heart nigga
Any complications pull the trigger, dusted and disgusted
Bitches can't be trusted, you know the rules
They underhanded, she planned it, you fuckin fool

[Interlude]
(These hoes out here tryin to hold a nigga's heart
So a nigga get his money fucked with
Almost in-laws)
Hey be proud of it when you turn these bitches upside down
What's gonna happen
(Uhh, three and a half dollars or probably fo' if
A bitch ridin)
(Yeah main, them hoes talented
They be fuckin with mo' MC's than Jack the Rapper)
(Aight fuck it, what you say Mall?
Ay, fuck them sheisty ass bootches, nigga)

[Mac Mall]
The California lifestyle that I live
Where the bitches is crooked and niggas jus don't give
A flyin fuck, so I stay stuck, smokin on the tay-low
Bay Area playa, tryin ta have shit major
And a bitch won't save ya
So I ain't playin Captain Save-a-Ho
I mob up in ya like a pro and then I'm gone
I'm like Sylvester Stallone, everyday is like a Cliffhanger
Action packed, I let the mini-mac smack that ass

[Spice 1]
Them hoes jacked that ass
Nigga woulda got smokin on that hash
Can't have my cash, better go and take your nigga stash
Cuz he's a busta, niggas with clusters
Slippin in shit, betta jack that nigga 'fore I jack his ass bitch
Never was no love for the mark-ass, the lo pink (the lo pink)
You love them Bootsy bitches, can't let them pussy bitches

[E-40]
Gank that ass, betta hide your cash and check her fast
Pump your brakes nigga, slow your roll don't go too fast
Cause bulletproof ain't doin no good no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Now, niggas comin up dead with they brains blew out on the fuckin floor
Damn, hollow points to flesh tears through the teflon vest
Now r-uh-rest
Pull a plug on a flatline over those, one nigga less
One nigga less, from coast to coast, to the East to the West
Crushin the flesh, dem bitches played a game of death
Look over your shoulder watch your back don't even trust it
I'm tryin to told ya end up dusted

Chorus[Verse 1:]
When I first glanced at ya, I knew I had to have ya
Fly chassis with a sassy manner
She hold herself in a high standard
And hella suckers in the hood ain't never ran in her
Young tender, thoroughbred, born winner
I know you're busy, but you need to holler at your nigga
I won't scare you away with fast talk and game
I wanna know if I can have ya, but I start witcha name
Who you with? you say that you ain't got no mayn?
I'm tryin to tell you, girl, I let you star on my team
A play-maker, make a player slow his pace up
The type of face a brother wanna see when he wake up
She works hard nine to five, sometimes more
Cuz go to school at night, you see she got big goals
And I don't wanna bring you down, I just wanna come along
Make you moan, make a home, a place that we can both grow old
See, let this truth be told, I'm tryin to leave that fast life alone
To find a woman of my own, so we can get together and build
A foundation that's real and everyday I make you feel like a mill'

[Hook:]
You got me wide open
But you ain't even knowin

{Shima}
You ain't knowin that I'm wide open
You got me goin and it's showin
That I want you
You ain't feelin me
I'm caught up indeed
You got me slippin and I'm trippin
Off the things you do

[Verse 2:]
You think I'm runnin drag, but I ain't even mad
I bet you all my cash I be the realest that you had
I wanna treat you lav', but you can't see that half
I'm tryin to keep you smilin if you just give me a chance
At times you make me laugh, you got me wide open
You think it's all a front, swear you ain't even knowin
If I was runnin drama on ya
I woulda bend in the wind, baby, hittin corners
Instead I'm standin right beside you like you know I'm 'posed to
Keepin composure, while most fools be in your face just tryin to get over
I see you know my style, me and my mob is wild
I hear your friends say I'm not trustworthy
But if you wait a while I shut that madness down
Prove to you once and for all that I'm deservin
Of your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, your time
If it's cool, boo, then give me a sign
Now I ain't tryin to rush you, but a/s, a/p
Keep a Mac on your mind and holler at me
I say ain't tryin to rush you, but a/s, a/p
Keep a Mac on your mind and holler at me

{Shima}
See I been waitin all my life
To find someone like you
And now that it's finally you and me
There's no time to lose
You're on my mind seven days a week
No matter what they say
Cause even though your style is wild
I like the way you do your thing
Baby, I'm wide open, too
I'm lovin me somethin new* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

[Quincy Jones]
Starry night.. an unknown creation
Written by, and from the archives of 2Pac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh

A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged, your life..

[Mac Mall]
Yeah, game laid down by Q, you know what I'm saying?
Vocals by Rasheeda, fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-C y'all, Mr. M-A-C Mall

[Hook: Rasheeda]
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us

[Mac Mall]
Uhh, uhh.. watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
And speak the truth on every thing I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life.. to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum calling soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold and dark and deep like the universe, but nah don't start
It's for your entertainment but it's my life y'all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause
But when you give your all, it's like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When your name is hot it's all love, the world is yours
But when you fall off, you get ignored

CHORUS

[Mac Mall]
You on the cover of the magazine, flossing on the TV screen
Toasting with your champagne, playin life like a game
Loaded in the limousine, love to hear the fans scream
Swimming with the sharks now, ain't no love - money king
People got they hands out but ain't nobody lending hands
Can you really blame them for trying to get what they can?
Late night, bright lights, lust and lies
And anything goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose your soul and who knows what you'll find
But go ahead man we all want to shine...
But go ahead man we all want to shine...

CHORUS

[Mac Mall]
There you have it..
You know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
You know to hold this microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
You know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy 2Pac did for sure
And he gave that to me
But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and your dream, you know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart
So sometime it's cold and it's dark, but it's raw
And that's how I'mma bring it to you every time, you know?

CHORUS (fades out)My name is young Mac Mall man, and this is my opinion
And since I got your attention there's some shit I'd like to mention
Fuck them punk ass rollers them highway type of strollers
Cause they be wanting to bust them big fat caps in ghetto souljas
I guess they wanna fold us, but see we won't just have that
Because I'm from the streets in '93 and playas bust back
I might just be a dead man
Because I speak rebellion
They ready did Malcolm X and Dr. King
There ain't no tellin'
The government they hatin me
But still I pack .380
Thats why I won't come back
Uncle Sammy never paid me
And today's the pay day
I'm standing in the cuts fuckin it up with my AK-
47 ways them black brothas won't behave
And since I'm stressed I'm on the quest to put them in their grave
I'm trying to go to school but the system wasn't havin me
Some say it's technicality but this is just reality
In 1992 you know crazy I was feelin

[Hook]
My name is young Mac Mall man and this is my opinion
This is my opinion[x4]

(Aww man, Mac Mall why you comin like that man?
You know thats that shit man straight from the Crestside man
You know they can't fuck with this man, uhhh thats that shit!)

My name is young Mac Mall man and this is my opinion
I had to set up shop, but it ain't rocks that I be dealin
The ghetto type of feelin
The drug money killin, I speaken playa styles
It's gonna make me a million
I'm tryin to burry happily but fools be wantin to cap on me
Thats why I plant in my coat, its something dope
I be packin G
It's gonna be a tragedy on your whole family
So call them punk police, them little old pussies can't even handle me
You might think I'm a criminal, but this is not subliminal
I'm tryin to spit that knowledge to my folks but you don't hear me though
Some might think I rock gang fuss, but all I want is justice
And my chance to get on the mike and spit game to these hustles
And if you like the realnes
You might think this appealing

[Hook]

(Haha, yea though nigga, thats that shit though
You mothafuckas need to hear the shit he spitting though
But you don't hear it though, you just some little punk mothafuckas man
He spitting that real Crestside Sawyer Street playa
Mothafuckas I don't give a fuck kuz I'm hitting this shit man, haha, biatch biatch biatch!)

Cause now I got my chance, to speak my opinion freely
They need to fit on blinders cuz these fools dont want to see me
I'm poppin like a preemy, sometimes I wear a beanie
Its on like that told ya cause that doja got me dreaming
When fools be pimpatraten
It's causin me frustration
And there's no hesitation
In a snitch assassination
Mac Mall is just a youngsta, hustla, thugsta
But if you fiend for dope ass raps, fool I'mma pluck ya
And them mothafuckas, them brothas
Is from another planet
They must don't understand it, how they take they life for granted
So tell me, can you really fuck with this young buck?
I take you on a ride in the trunk side up
And with luck, maybe they can find ya, and sign ya
Off as a loss cause you toss of my penis
Breathing if you live, make dibs on the woodbox
I be kicking tha rocks and shit, and don't sport the dreadlocks

[Hook]-=Mac Dre talking=-
Ah, what, ah, what
Mall Macenroe, like what!
Andre Macassi ah, ugh
Street Sampras, what it do?
What that is?
What it do?
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh

[Mac Dre]
This ain't no love ballad
Or romance song
This a dance song for you can get yo dance on
It's hard to keep my pants on when I'm giggin'
And when I'm giggin' it look like I'm diggin'
I do the pigeon, bird like a nerd
I'm on Hennessey rappin' every line every word
I dust myself off
Like I stoled thurr
Skinny nigga giggin' wit no shirt
I get chauffer so I can passenger gig
Get the chips and don't trip off her mask and her wig
So that's why I'm askin' her this:

Can you really do the dew and pursue the green?
I ask her who the king

[Rydah J. Klyde]
She was doin' the twist and pop
While I was trynna get the cork out the Crys then pop all in her hair
The champagne shampoo was flash dance too
Baby want me to dance too but that I can't do
She was giggin' too hard for me
Turned around and my dick stretched the yard you see
I can't play wit you lil' mama
Thizzle got you crazy
Shocked her when I stood up and walked on her lazy
Broke it down touched the ground; rolls wit the 80's shit
Lit that hazy, asked her "What you know about Thizz?"
"What you know about this? Naw Bitch Thizz"
Cuz that's what it is
DJ put us in the mix
Watch us pump up the party
Cuz we didn't come to bothy nobody

Swing them dreads, movin' heads, getting' stupid
Naw that's the old look they gig to this new shit watch me

[Hook] - 3X

[Mac Mall]
I'm a fan of the running man
Old school Cabbage Patch

Lil' mama giggin' wit me tryin' hard to keep up
But I'm bustin' moves that she never even heard of
Feelin' it, Thizz face look permanent

Quick to Michael Jackson spin and do the Mahoney
You squares is phony
But your bitch still want me
Cuz I do the George Jefferson oh so coldly

So I'm a break it down to the fresh outfit
Lil' mama movin' but you know she can't handle it

[Verse 1: 100s]
Can I get a what what, skate thru and check it when the nuts bust
Pusha man the ???? projects to the trust fund
Love Jones gotta call his bitch lie, can find your relationship with that nigga
Throw paper crazy, say you love her, tell her you ain't gotta do that baby
And the ???? can come too, with a nigga in a Eddie Murphy Raw jump suit
You got a friend, lookin for a job, not a career? Trust she can come too
Lil' faggot ho on my lap, tryna sock it to my pot of gold
Cus she know on the side of this rainbow huh, ain’t nothing but game ho

I ride, I ride, I ride

And it ain't, never hard to find a player, just follow that drip

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
Cavity from the candy paint,
Yo this is top rank
I turn around like whatchu thank?
Dipped in butter, super laced
Turn up the Nakamichi
When I floss you gotta see me
Gotta throw my work around
So my work a' work around

Cavity from the candy paint, I like to blow dank
Take down the whole drank, drive at a fast pace
Cavity from the candy paint, I like to blow dank
Take down the whole drank, drive at a fast pace

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
Cavity from the candy paint, press the gas then hit the break
Tiger prawns and New York steak, I'm known to rattle like a snake
Cavity from the candy paint, I do it all again
Buy a quarter ounce of kush, then crack a pint of Henn
Touch it off with lemon squeeze, a double shot, you best believe
I'm bout to drive I got the keys, that’s hot to death but you could freeze
Through there like Marcus Allen, soul food, Chinese and Italian
If she thick then she a stallion, man that’s like countin Paypa
I'm just like Tony Draper, Benzed up on all my neighbors
My Jordan number 5’s are super live, with a touch of flava
I let the weed blow and the engine run like a hot gun
And you know the one when you see the one
Cus when you see the one you wanna be the one

WHAT

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]

Take down the whole drank, drive at a fast pace
Cavity from the candy paint, I like to blow dank

Do it to em, add more members to my movement
Stand campaigning and recruiting, ?? choosin they ain't stupid
Suckas sad, marks mad, cus they bottom bitch been boosted
Im cut throat Mac, I get the scratch before I goose it
Remix it, reloop it, now she on some new shit
New mackin, New money, new whips and all the cool shit
So corny clowns chattin' to her now is quite useless
But study my every word like creature on the pulpit, church
Don’t come at cuddy wrong or you will get murked
I clap ya in the head if Nickatina don’t get you first
In the Crestside turf, we hit em where it hurts
Gangsta Mac, if you had to describe me with two words
So nigga the news gets served if she missin' rest your nerves
Cus she chose up on some mackin' and no longer hang with herbs

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
Cavity from the candy paint
Yo this is top rank
I turn around like whatchu thank
Dipped in butter, super laced
Turn up the Nakamichi
When I floss you gotta see me
Gotta throw my work around
So my work a work around

Cavity from the candy paint, I like to blow dank
Take down the whole drank, drive at a fast pace
Cavity from the candy paint, I like to blow dank
Take down the whole drank, drive at a fast pace-= Mac Dre talking=
Da U.S. Open [uh, hello, uh]
Let the games begin [hello, uh, hello]

[Mac Dre]
You white around the mouth
Your lips need car-mex
I'm steady jumpin' out more whips than Car Max
I'm rock star stooey wit the Louie guitar strap
Get weeded not conceded
Give a groupie a call back
I'm all that and a bag a chips dude
Got fists dude
Beat downs get issued
I'm rich dude
TV's and errythang
Diamond's shinin', danglin' from my heavy chain
Very plain, and I come dumb wit it
Your soft, hand it off, let a real nigga run wit it
I'm dumb fitted, shitted, P-O-L-O
Your chick's a flirt
She always tell me "hello"
She shake it like jello to see if I'm a look
She off the hook
And potna I'm a crook
I take your bitch if I want her
Cuss up on her
Bust nuts on her

Handcuff your bitch [handcuff the bitch]

Shackles on the ankle of a fast ho, let her go
Baby boo boo fan of Macenroe at every show
Chasey want an autograph
I gave her dick to the throat
Signed it on her grill
"MAC THE MOST" in capitals
Internationally known
Crestside home grown
Game fed, hard head
Three C's, stoned dome
Let the games begin
Let the mackin' commence
Thizz is in the tilt
And we all ignorant
But later for you hater
Y'all make a good payer
Yo bitch is old news
I get it back when I had the gator
But now it's me and Macassi
Servin' it up savagely
Mac Magician specializin'
Keepin' hoes vanishin' POOF!

[Hook][Intro: synthesized voice-over]
This program will be temporarily interupted
Everyone, including freaks, has been contaminated
By the radio activity

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
R, A, D-I-O
Finna throw this thing back like G.I. Joe
Lyin' though, Decepticon
They kinda like Cafe Escalon
Glass packed, El Da Rock
Had a snub .38 before I held a Glock
Twenty-sackin', hear me slappin'
Niggas go dumb when they hear me rappin'
So quick, I'm dumpin' and I'm clappin'
If somethin' finna happen, Thump in my lap then
Rat-a-tat, tat-a-tat-tada
She won't give in to ya? Let me have at her!
Ladies, women, girls, broads
Miracle paints at Earl Scheib
It really don't matter what I strike
Bet they still buy me what I like

[Hook]
It's that radio, activity [2x]

[Verse 2: Mac Mall]
D-Boy baby mama actin' roudy outside
Roudy outside, roudy outside
D-Boy baby mama actin' roudy outside
"Later!" for that shit, we don't fuck with 'em like swine
Actin', maxin
Blappin' automatics
Savage to extensive damage
Havin' sucker-absent
Man, look at baby - she want me to tap it!
If I hit it once, she gonna jock me & trap it
Strip the game naked like Mac & Magic Mike
And I come from the slum where life is trife
But tonight, pass the Remy right
To a Mac, like a Gucciano blessing the mic
Cutthroats in the building, and you know they high
Chasise sayin' "Mac'n, yo flow so tight!"
For real, Side Show
Smokin' Backwoods with my folks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
(Look out, pimp!) Urkel, Blue, Welch's Grape
Vallejo, Cali-fool-ya: Planet of the Apes!
Where we shroom the coon & push work
Snort dog-poop, pop pills & Purp
They go, go bezerk, when they hear this black
Hit the intersect, figure-8, and back
E-40, Dre & Mall put the 'V' on the map
For the last decade, carried the Bay on my back
Daddy-long like pimp perms, slicker than word-s-perm
I'm on the radio like Howard Stern!
40 Water got money to burn
I'mma be here for awhile, y'all gotta wait y'all turn
Heavy watch lift weights on my wrist
Pull dime duces? Stay & I'm fit
So you know I can take your bitch
Nigga better Tucker like Chris!

[Hook][E-40](Richie Rich)
I'm really not all that sure
Bout when things is finna mature
So let me find me a nigga with a grip
And hit his ass quick with one of them licks
(What's the definition of a lick?)
Taking a niggas shit
(Hey put that on sumthin)
I put that on The Click, The Click
Back to fuckin work one of the homies jus got dusted
Time to do some dirt, uhh, I never trusted
Them bustas shot him in the shirt, dead on arrival
Now the town is funking, it's called survival
What y'all wanna do? They got us skunked
(Well if uhh, we can just uhh) if it was a fifth we'll all be drunk
I'm heated, them niggas cheated, played me false
We had a meetin, shit 'posed to been squashed
I noticed one killa on the double dribble and set him up y'all
She likes the Monie in the Middle, play tetherball
Thick ass bitch, high yellow city-slicker
Scarecrow creepin Southern bitches, aka Posie Pussyfictious

[Spice 1]
Nigga been holdin guts, but shit on hisself and a funky bill
Pullin out bills, frontin on material shit
That's when I get to killin shit (killin shit)
And settin 'im up and havin 'im catchin a couple of slugs
Sl-uh sl-uh slugs, trynta fuck with savage thug
Pistol pop in they ass, see niggas be gettin this twisted
It's that bitch that killed ya
Took all your money peeled ya
Seven niggas bust in the room with AK's
While a nigga be puttin on his jimmy
All of a sudden they shoot up your Vuitton
Before you can hit the broccoli
See money-a-made that nigga, that nigga didn't make that money
Left them niggas jacked up, and the bitch she macked him
He's a busta, punk ass nigga, y'all know the streets
That's why that nigga naked layin dead in between some bloody sheets
It's just a part of the game he didn't feel
Bitches will kill, fuck a nigga, out his last d-uh dollar bill
You don't know that ho main that bitch can't be trusted
Dusted and di-motherfuckin-sgusted

[Hook: E-40]
Some cold hearted shit
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Whacha'll wanna do, whacha'll wanna do
Cold hearted bitches
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Whacha'll wanna do, I never trusted them bustas
Some cold hearted shit
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
I never trusted them bustas
And it's them cold hearted nigga
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Dusted and disgusted

[E-40]
Let's let of some two or threes on the other side of t-uh-town
Draw the attention on the other s-uh-side of town (other side of town)
And wait for the po-po shift to change, ghetto shootin range
Revenge on the r-uh-rebound, war games
Droughts, ouch, lost clientele but I will prevail
By sellin the broccoli dank instead of the crack cocaine
Try not to steal narcotics
When these punk MC's and bitches be the reason why
The smoke be comin up out the chop, with my nigga 'Pac

[2Pac]
Dear God, can you forgive me? My future's lookin sick
I'm in my rag hittin switches I'm suspicious of these bitches
I keep on, calllin, but ain't nobody pickin up
I think she's stallin, this evil bitch is tryin ta set me up
Came all alone if it's on then it's on
Where's my motherfuckin chrome, only jealous niggas roam
It's a war zone (war zone) but I'm a man so with gun in hand
I'm on my way to see this ho you know the fuckin plan
Can't understand, but the things ain't the same
You could die over these bitches if you slippin in the game
Niggas gang bang, but bitches gang bang too
Give up that good thang, and put that pistol to your brain
If you a smart figure, don't have no love in your heart nigga
Any complications pull the trigger, dusted and disgusted
Bitches can't be trusted, you know the rules
They underhanded, she planned it, you fuckin fool

[Interlude]
(These hoes out here tryin to hold a nigga's heart
So a nigga get his money fucked with
Almost in-laws)
Hey be proud of it when you turn these bitches upside down
What's gonna happen
(Uhh, three and a half dollars or probably fo' if
A bitch ridin)
(Yeah main, them hoes talented
They be fuckin with mo' MC's than Jack the Rapper)
(Aight fuck it, what you say Mall?
Ay, fuck them sheisty ass bootches, nigga)

[Mac Mall]
The California lifestyle that I live
Where the bitches is crooked and niggas jus don't give
A flyin fuck, so I stay stuck, smokin on the tay-low
Bay Area playa, tryin ta have shit major
And a bitch won't save ya
So I ain't playin Captain Save-a-Ho
I mob up in ya like a pro and then I'm gone
I'm like Sylvester Stallone, everyday is like a Cliffhanger
Action packed, I let the mini-mac smack that ass

[Spice 1]
Them hoes jacked that ass
Nigga woulda got smokin on that hash
Can't have my cash, better go and take your nigga stash
Cuz he's a busta, niggas with clusters
Slippin in shit, betta jack that nigga 'fore I jack his ass bitch
Never was no love for the mark-ass, the lo pink (the lo pink)
You love them Bootsy bitches, can't let them pussy bitches

[E-40]
Gank that ass, betta hide your cash and check her fast
Pump your brakes nigga, slow your roll don't go too fast
Cause bulletproof ain't doin no good no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Now, niggas comin up dead with they brains blew out on the fuckin floor
Damn, hollow points to flesh tears through the teflon vest
Now r-uh-rest
Pull a plug on a flatline over those, one nigga less
One nigga less, from coast to coast, to the East to the West
Crushin the flesh, dem bitches played a game of death
Look over your shoulder watch your back don't even trust it
I'm tryin to told ya end up dusted

Chorus[Anyway, it doesn't matter much how you feel
You know what you got to do, I'm here to do it
How about you?]

E-40:
Our age, five-years-old
We were young bucks
Scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub
Babysitter would send you to bed
But she would make me stay up
So she could give the young playa some viscious head uh
Early symptoms of
Time of nightway
Gigantic factor from the
Caukenis bitch tamer
Some had it all though
But less unfortunate
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose
And I had a Huffy
You owned a green machine
Three different lunch pails
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails
We grew up in the church together nigga
Sunday school
Now I heard you off into jackin nigga
That ain't even cool
I used to be conned, racked, fucked around
And ripped bad
Barking up on the wrong tree
Talking about runnin up in my past

[Mac Mall]
Niggas have hateful thoughts
But they stop me from strivin
Suckas be shakin salt
All in his gameful so find
Some fools be gettin crossed
Victims of faultiness
Man all that drama you come with
I swear you on some shit
Whether it's morphine or cocaine
Doja or doggfood
They had these marks for Tre and Max
Fuckin off my high breakin rules
You got ya P's mixed up
You ain't no pimp
You's a phoney
I spit for major mix
While you make tapes for ya homie
And then you work up tha nerve
To speak foul words
The pimp, a traitor, we instigators
That's why I wrote this verse
For every youngster with his mind on his meal
Young playa just chill
And take a look at what these fakers call real
Nigga

[Big Mike]
I trust no man
Cuz man will let you down every time
That's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme
Cuz I've seen better times
And I've seen worser days
When some of my so called friends
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say
I quench my thirst today
With righteous thoughts of mind
Cuz righteous thought of mind will leave mark ass niggas far behind
I seen it every time
They come and go
That's why I drop to my knees
And ask god to distinguish friend from foe
And what do you know
By the time morning comes I can see the light
And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene
Countin' greens
Straight from H-town to New Orleans
New human beings puttin it down like a mic or not
Replace the slot open up shop
We 'bout to make it hot
Stop
With ya devilish doins
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know

[8ball]
Listen
I'm tryin to tell you my nigga to watch cha back
And trust few
Cause ain't no nigga gon watch ya back for you like you
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust
See let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make
Don't want no bustas around me
Playa hatin or actin fake
Don't ever be wantin nobody to get to close
I don't know if it's effects of
From the marijuana that got me more than trippin
See nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone?
See, my partners who used to ride with me
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll?
Maybe they will, maybe they won't
Who is to say what a nigga will do
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help you
See what I'm sayin, listen to me and see if you can dig this
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people recieve ends
Now all of a sudden I'm actin funny because my moneys loaned
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin you don't already know
Personal business, you got to watch who you friends is

[MJG]
I'm thinking about hard times
Freeing my mind
Who in the fuck goin be my crutch?
Holdin me up, helpin me out
Makin sure that I stay in touch
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to?
When I be low on my cash
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin bout kickin my ass?
Who is my friends who is my foes?
Who do I ask, when I want to know
Somethin about somethin but I don't know nothin
My ignorance be keepin me out in the cold
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride?
In somebody elses car
How do I get from point A to B if B is just to far?
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone?
Who's goin to give me the permission to make a decision
To come up in they house and live
When will I drive a BMer takin my clothes to the cleaner
How can I know
Will I forever be payin my dues, will I forever be singing the blues?
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin to lean
Know what I mean?
When I be needin some justification
Stuck in the fuckin same location
Who is the friend that is helpin me?
Who is the busta thats hurtin me?
Who can I trust?
Will you be there when the goin is tough?
Will I be hangin with dick in the dust?
Who wanna share my load when it's too heavy to carry?
Or will I go crazy pullin the load alone?
Constantly gettin my hustle on
When will I finally see, kinda suspect
Or even actually know
Who is my real friend thick and the thin?
And who in the fuck is the foe?

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know...Chorus:

Vicious as I come cause I come kinda vicious
Missing little snitches cause you know I'm about to   spit this
Rhyme for tha number nine nigga
Grab your gat cock tha hammer back and pull tha    trigger
Squatting in the buck buck cause I don't give a fuck
Puffin' on the blunt now ya know I'm kinda stuck
So when ya hear me goin' bust a move and Get Low

(Chorus)

(Mac Mall)
Game recognize game, in tha bay mane
And bitches jock for cash, this shit'll never change
So I maintain and always keep my gat on my lap
For tha simple fact the grind is low so niggas jack
But I can give a fuck about a P.H
My clip pack thirty, so watch me decay
A captain save-a-ho and watch him fall to the turf
And my cuddies gone beat him to a burst
Can't put him in a herse the trunk of a chevy let him  squeeze
And them I'm going sess-ways throwing up tha ST's ST's  SP's
I went to Frisco and smoked about a O
And now I'm in tha studio feelin' two-toed

Get right
Get right
Get right

[ VERSE 1 ]
I can't lie, I like to get high and figure-8 when I drive
Blow doja rope in the sky for all my cuddies that died
We can't do nothin but strive during the struggle
You want a silver spoon in your mouth, you gotta hustle
As I take another hit of the spliff that soldiers passin
The only chance I get to feel peace, I gotta have some
So see, I spark the holla a lot, it keeps me goin
Baby boy 3 steps ahead of his death, and mama knowin
So she's sayin, "Baby, change your ways"
But I was raised in the days of Uzis and A.K.'s
Where killers play their deadly game called the pistol-tag
Just let me live, I ask
But if you're caught in a cross, then I'mma off your ass
Young nigga that's tryin to have the better things in life
He went from crookin and rookin to jookin overnight
Some try to say he ain't right, but who's to say that he's wrong
That's why you're starvin, and the name of this song
Is get some Get Right

[ Hook: Levitti ]
You, you need to get some get right
Cause fools, they choose to front their whole life
You need to get some get right
Cause fools, they choose to front their whole life

[ VERSE 2 ]
I tried to tell my young partner to take a look at his life
But he don't like how it's lookin, because his money ain't right
And gettin high as a kite is his way to escape the ghetto heat
In them streets where it ain't no peace
He's stayin fast on his feet, cause the rollers be chainin
And if they have you with that d, it ain't no use in explainin
Cause they gon' slam you on your face, haul you off with a case
And in the belly of the beast you're straight tucked away
But he don't hear me though, he rather sling the dope
And to that day illegal business got my folks smoked
It got me feelin like it ain't no hope for black males
If you're out there in the life it's either jail or it's hell
See, jail is what they send us to
And hell is what we're livin through
So get some get right is what you better do

[ Levitti ] Better do
[ Mac Mall ] Better do (3x)

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now back in 1983 we played as kids in the street
Never thought in '96 I'd roll my strip totin heat
And player, funkin with the feds was never fun to me
But man, the rollers try to take the hood from under me
Haters come with jealousy, but they ain't fadin me none
Too busy mackin bout my mail and tryin to make 21
Some of my cuddies didn't live to see the big twump-ace
And I be damned if I got out like a statistic today
So I'mma get some get right, get my game tight
Hustlin on the mic, now my name's in lights
Me and my cuddies was broke, but not no mo', mayn
They down with Cessed Out, so there's no more cocaine
Tryin to show my folks there's way mo'
To life than just bangin and hittin licks and sellin dope
Playboy, it's almost 2000, peep the game's gettin colder
And if somebody asks ya, tell em Mac Mall told ya

[ Hook ]-=Mac Dre talking=-
Ah, what, ah, what
Mall Macenroe, like what!
Andre Macassi ah, ugh
Street Sampras, what it do?
What that is?
What it do?
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh

[Mac Dre]
This ain't no love ballad
Or romance song
This a dance song for you can get yo dance on
It's hard to keep my pants on when I'm giggin'
And when I'm giggin' it look like I'm diggin'
I do the pigeon, bird like a nerd
I'm on Hennessey rappin' every line every word
I dust myself off
Like I stoled thurr
Skinny nigga giggin' wit no shirt
I get chauffer so I can passenger gig
Get the chips and don't trip off her mask and her wig
So that's why I'm askin' her this:
Can you do the thing?
Can you really do the dew and pursue the green?
I ask her who the king
She tell me I'm is [Nothin' but the hook]
It's almost time kid
I'm trynna see some grindin'
Can you dig?
Yeah you fine bitch but can you gig?

[Hook] - 3X : Mac Dre
Baby can you gig?
You so crazy when you gig
Eeew she giggin'
Lady can you gig?
Girl you so crazy when you gig
Eeew he giggin'

[Rydah J. Klyde]
She was doin' the twist and pop
While I was trynna get the cork out the Crys then pop all in her hair
The champagne shampoo was flash dance too
Baby want me to dance too but that I can't do
She was giggin' too hard for me
Turned around and my dick stretched the yard you see
I can't play wit you lil' mama
Thizzle got you crazy
Shocked her when I stood up and walked on her lazy
Broke it down touched the ground; rolls wit the 80's shit
Lit that hazy, asked her "What you know about Thizz?"
"What you know about this? Naw Bitch Thizz"
Cuz that's what it is
DJ put us in the mix
Watch us pump up the party
Cuz we didn't come to bothy nobody
It's 300 Bay cats in the lobby
Swing them dreads, movin' heads, getting' stupid
Naw that's the old look they gig to this new shit watch me

[Hook] - 3X

[Mac Mall]
I'm a fan of the running man
Old school Cabbage Patch
Might mix some prep wit a lil' Roger Rabbit
Robo Cop, up-rock, pop lock, boogaloo
I don't know about you but where I'm from you see we act a fool
Lil' mama giggin' wit me tryin' hard to keep up
But I'm bustin' moves that she never even heard of
Feelin' it, Thizz face look permanent
Advance Bird Dance now we call the shit "The Buzzer" bitch
Humpty Dance don't got nothin' on me
Quick to Michael Jackson spin and do the Mahoney
You squares is phony
But your bitch still want me
Cuz I do the George Jefferson oh so coldly
Yeah it's a celebration bitch
So I'm a break it down to the fresh outfit
Lil' mama movin' but you know she can't handle it
I'm in the middle of the floor wit my hands on my dick

[Hook] - 3X[Verse 1: Young Lay]
Cuddies perved by the corner, stout, herb
Got me twisted, mo' cold killin' murders
Them brothers gettin' further
Got my pencil for utensil, this'll keep they mind knownin
Spot some thugs at the club, and they got the nines showin
Dirty pimpin g's, one of my dreams, player now listen
Lotta blacks locked down, but comin back around in '96
All the gals my six (what else?) my track crew and my mother
Make these police wonder: how is he so undercover?
Never been a lover, but America had broke my heart
I was told to tear up out this before this tear me apart
Eat through scrap, black tracks, free milk and cheese
While the Japs stack scratch with the Vietnamese
But I'm finna' squeeze, stack G'z they left on a trap
A young playa mack, hit the bud', spit a rap
It's just that feelin, that feelin that I have for children
Are able to love us, but these crazy devils try to kill us

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin that dank to deal with the pain

(My nigga Ray Luv, when'd you get up out the pen, man?)

[Verse 2: Ray Luv]
June 2nd '93 I returned to the streets
Did 2 months in the county and I opt to the beat
Now the cops keep watch, cause they know that I rap
Tell the world that I'm a gangsta, cause I ride with a strap
But I ain't yo gangsta, just a young nigga caught up in the struggle
Born hustler, goin' for the jugular
Out to take the beast down, piece down might be too late
The funk is on, high, drunk off Thunderbird and Grape Kool-Aid
Would love to catch a playa slippin', take me down and book me
Guilty as charged, hit the switch and try to cook me
Silence a nigga for the shit I'm spittin, I know I'm scarin' ya
A poison you created in the veins of America
Mis-educated, incarcerated, institutionalized
That 3rd strike will have a gang of them rollers dyin'
Ain't no love where I'm goin', no love where I'm comin' from
Remember me, that real-ass nigga you been runnin' from
Got us sprung off the cocaine and the welfare
While the black babies die without health care

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the pain

[Verse 3: Mac Mall]
Now how could I pledge allegiance to a racist-ass flag
When the rollers at my do' with a .44 mag?
Got my mother spittin' drag 'bout I ain't home
Got a double homicide warrant on my dome
I hear em pushin in the do', I grab my Mac with two clips
Cut through the back window and like a g hit a fence
I'm thinkin' 'bout my folks gettin' sent for violation
Foes and punk police, them devils still at my do'
I peep a group of ten tryina' get information
I threw the clips in the Mac, start lettin' off frustration
It's better than incarceration any day, we gonn' die anyway
So if I go out blastin', call it my fate
I got niggas' in the pen like my cousin Bud
Lunatic Insane, and my partner T-Love
Big Tom, Ray Ray, Kilo Cutt, Mac Dre
Cleek, Jamal, Jinx and Bluebonic, man

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the pain

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Now I been called a crook, a killer, a thug
A no-good dealer of drugs
And Blood or Cuz, doesn't matter what set you was
Cause where I'm at, if you black, we strapped
As long as ki's make g's these thieves attack
And ain't no rules on the streets these days
Muthafuckas' better watch they back and take it eazay'
I'm livin in the dangerzone
And learnin' lesson from the game, it's on
Niggas' was gone when the frame was on
I'm gettin breakin' them balls daily
Is there a ghetto in heaven or do I go to hell?
See, seems I was sentenced to death, takin my steps with my head down
While pour I liquor for my niggas', cause they dead now
My memory since I was a little seed
Was a penitentiary full of niggas' like me
These cops can't terrorize us, they despise us
Niggas, cause we on the rise
Plus everybody's searchin' for a piece of the truth
And the youth turn the streets into a piece of Beirut
And the truth is

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the pain[Verse 1: Mac Mall]
Sometimes I sit alone and seek into my thoughts
Thinking about the game and how much cocaine is bought
Bodies fucking fiend so instead of going broke
I had to [?...] watch a youngster go locc
I hit the fucking strip like a savage
Sell after sell now I am living kind of lavish
I ain't no high roller but on a steady rise
And this stip is getting crowded so a youngster had to strive
I'm only on the first fucking level of the game
Me and my cuddies on the ave selling caine
Thinking about the day that my business will excel
But I need more fiends, more product, more mail
So me and my cuddie plan on a move
To the other side of town where the caine flow is cool
It was kind of smooth how we hit they fucking blocc
Selling hella rocks ain't thinking about getting caught
Then some other man started to notice the come-up
It was just a matter of time before the first [n****] run up
I said 'it's cool man we out here for peace...
We ain't tripping off yall [n****s] cause there's money in these streets'
But word on the turf is fuck [?...] cause me and my cuddies sell [?...]
I'm mad as fuck so they task me to get my mask
Drive past and bust a cap up in a [n****a] ass
This is how it went down where they at I'm curious
I'm [?...] on my gat the [?...] I be delirious
I see him in a circle in a crowd rolling dice
Shit was nothing nice how I took [?...]
BOOM BOOM
Tricks duck and realize I'm capping
Couple fools to the ground they found out what happened
It ain't no stop for what I do for my riches
I'm watching [n***as] catching hot ones screaming like bitches
And they going to wonder what is this
An 'eye-for-a-mother-fucking-eye' when I am doing illegal business

[Verse 2: Mac Mall]
And after the fuck I think I best pack heat
Cause fool be getting smoked in these inner city streets
About a week later man these fools want vengeance
I was kicking it up on the blocc and heard a '40 Chevy engine
This must be the hit so now I run for cover
Mad as fuck cause these fools want to get me on the under
Nothing really happened just some capping and a casualty
A smoked out fiend on the blocc he used to work for me
Shit was kind of sick about the fiend man I say fuck him
He tripping off the rocks that he had that's why they [?...] him
Now it seems the rollers want to stop me, want to jock me, always hanging around my blocc G
And they got my boy stressing especially when they took me down for questions
But I set a little drama saying that my grand-moma live out here I came out just to see her
And now I know I got to get ghost thou
Cause I don't want the po-po to kick down my door
So before I leave I got a trick up my sleeve
I rather [?..] and the uzi machines
But can't forget the 380
So watch a young ass [n***a] go crazy
I found out who was calling the shots
Knocked on his front door
BOOM
Now that's one mother fucker popped
Went to his [?...] spot
Saw five punk fools in the parking lot
They didn't understand how we [?...]
So a fool tried to run so we shot
And as soon as we tried to get up out of there
Saw the roller and cars and cops man everywhere
That's what we get fucked up on a hit
Got to stay on your mother fucking toes when you're doing illegal business

[Verse 3: Mac Mall]
So now I'm chilling like a mother fucking villan in a jail cell
Post bail cause my attorney knew the judge well
So the state sent the [District Attorney] to get me
The rollers ran in my house and found a half a [kilo]
My lawyer said 'if things don't go as planned...
They can send a [n***a] down for straight life man'
So I blame it on society
Cause if life would have been better for me I wouldn't slang D
But that's beside the point
Think about my case as I fire up the doja joint
My lawyer called and said forget about the rocks at your residence
A junkie just turned 'state evidence'
DAMN and now I'm in a real shock
Because a fiend that used to work for me hooked up with the cops
I got to think of a plan
Don't want to be watched like [?...]
[? Paid off ?] the DA and now he's on my side
So the first day of court I sit there like a mac and watch the DA fuck up the facts
At the end of the trial the judge sentences me to 4, huh
But I'm only doing 2 [years] thou
Just some time to get my game straight
And figure out where I'm going to relocate
So don't trip cause I will be out in a few
So look me up in a ghetto near you
Doing straight illegal business- chorus 4X -
Everybody is gettin everybody
Let's get a telly and don't tell nobody

Step into the party, pimpin is my hobby
Yo bitch is hatin Mall, because she knew she never got me
Cuddies smokin blunts, because we all young ballers
Comin straight from Cali, Crest Creepers's what they call us
Ain't nobody trippin, cuz we're all about our fetti
Strip full of Caddies and them muthafuckin Chevy's
Cut thangs, Mustangs, 5.0's
Bitches in my party, and they feelin too towed
Me, I'm hella saucy, but I don't sniff blow
I'm known to bust them raps with that killer pimp flow
Hoochies in my face, and they all poppin pussy
But bitch, I get so deep up in that yak, you wanna jook me
With a butcher knife, so back up out my life
I cannot be your boyfriend but I can lay the pipe
The party's full of folks, all my cuddies from the turf
I crack a pint of Hymen, now we all gettin perved

- chorus -

Let my cuddy hold my thang, cuz my folks is way deep
It ain't about the game you hear, it's about the game you peep
I'm seein niggas slappin hoes, cuz they gettin outta line
I crack up as I act up off that 'Voisier and lime
Your bitch in front of me got yak longer than a g block
So now I'm freakin baby girl hands on the cock
Just then, guess who bust in?
The bitch I'm fuckin with - oh, I didn't know that was yo cousin
But before she tripped I tried to act dumb
I put her in her place, Crestside is where I'm from
And a matter of fact, fuck both of y'all hoes
You're fuckin with some pimp, so the story goes

- chorus -

I fiend, that you and me
Need to stop playin games and go smooth up a tree
On your knees in a telly, high from Hennessy
Put them legs on my shoulders, now I'm goin way deep
She took the dick from the pussy straight to her throat
I love it when I'm drunk and fuckin with a nympho
Slide to the slide, k to the y
Keep a hat on my shaft, cuz I don't wanna die
I heard a bitch lie, told her friends that I made her cream
Straight salt-shakin, tryin to aggravate my team
But game don't stop until the casket drop
Or the feds can count my dough
Top-notch bitches pickin Mall like a 'fro
Never would a player go low
Rivals thinkin that must be smokin dope
So all the macks kick back, because Mac Mall done came anew
And in the V-Town, this is what we do

- chorus -[Mac Mall talking]
You crash-helmet wearin' heffer
You turf-dirt tramp
You sack-chasin ass cunt
Bathwaterless bitch

[Mac Mall]
Whats up with it ho, tell me, whats it all about?
Seems you always talkin' shit when this pimp dick not in your mouth
And then you wonder why a nigga quick to dig your helmet
And slap your ass so hard when usually I'm smooth as velvet
See trick I'm from the Bay and man we make them broads Obey
And if you don't then you gon' sport up on sling and neck brace
Word to OJ and my nigga Ike Turner
If that ho don't know her role them I'mma learn her
Since out I turned her, she get hella emotional
But don't let them square biz feelings get that ass beat down
And even now I get the feminists sayin'
"a real man would never put his hands on a woman"
But a punk-bitch ain't no lady
They shifty and shady
Crooked connivin' 5150 crazy
But I'm quick to introduce her to the Mac-Prozac
Choke-holds and back hand slaps
Now bitch dig that!

[Hook (x2): Mac Mall]
Maca-frama-lamma punk ho toe-tagga
Savage mainy-mannish plus a money hungry bastard
Big face stacker and a mouth piece master
Never chase that bitch I'd rather let you suckas catch her

[Mac Dre]
Now to understand a maca-frama-lamma
You must first know the lingo
Comprehend the grammar
Feel me when I flow, learn what I'm lacing
Mac, I Mastered the Art of Communication
365 days a year
I'm in a bitch's ear
Saying what she wanna hear
Trying to get things clear
If they ain't clear
And if she stay here
She's running like a reindeer
No playin' here, it's mackin' for real
Packin' a steel, stackin' the scrill
So if you happen to feel kinda pimperistic
You got the Furly Ghost in ya
You feelin' my linguistics
Don't get it twisted
Lets keep this on the up and up
Pimp the Blood up out her if she out there fuckin' up
It's time to toughen up and do this cutthoatish
Them maca-frama-lamma, niggas, is the coldest!

[Hook x2]

[Mac Mall]
Oops upside your head
Keep poppin' off at the grill and I'mma beat you like a egg
See your brother's a punk and your daddy's a old man
They get in my business and I'mma send 'em back payin'
You know what I'm sayin'
No, ho, I ain't no gentleman
I'm a cutthroat nigga from that that Crestside Clan
Won't tell you check yourself cause I got it
A tested method to get a bitch back in pocket
See one of my my breezies start to bumpin' them gums
A mac black out, and get to goin' on one
And I don't give a fuck let the police come
Lets split this bitch wig because she much too dumb
Said I don't give a fuck let the police come
Let's split this bitch wig because she much too dumb
We keepin' it mackin' on the real where I'm from
A nothing-ass slut talk shit she gets stomped, stomped

[Hook x2]My name is young Mac Mall man, and this is my opinion
And since I got your attention there's some shit I'd like to mention
Fuck them punk ass rollers them highway type of strollers
Cause they be wanting to bust them big fat caps in ghetto souljas
I guess they wanna fold us, but see we won't just have that
Because I'm from the streets in '93 and playas bust back
I might just be a dead man
Because I speak rebellion
They ready did Malcolm X and Dr. King
There ain't no tellin'
The government they hatin me
But still I pack .380
Thats why I won't come back
Uncle Sammy never paid me
And today's the pay day
I'm standing in the cuts fuckin it up with my AK-
47 ways them black brothas won't behave
And since I'm stressed I'm on the quest to put them in their grave
I'm trying to go to school but the system wasn't havin me
Some say it's technicality but this is just reality
In 1992 you know crazy I was feelin

[Hook]
My name is young Mac Mall man and this is my opinion
This is my opinion[x4]

(Aww man, Mac Mall why you comin like that man?
You know thats that shit man straight from the Crestside man
You know they can't fuck with this man, uhhh thats that shit!)

My name is young Mac Mall man and this is my opinion
I had to set up shop, but it ain't rocks that I be dealin
The ghetto type of feelin
The drug money killin, I speaken playa styles
It's gonna make me a million
I'm tryin to burry happily but fools be wantin to cap on me
Thats why I plant in my coat, its something dope
I be packin G
It's gonna be a tragedy on your whole family
So call them punk police, them little old pussies can't even handle me
You might think I'm a criminal, but this is not subliminal
I'm tryin to spit that knowledge to my folks but you don't hear me though
Some might think I rock gang fuss, but all I want is justice
And my chance to get on the mike and spit game to these hustles
And if you like the realnes
You might think this appealing

[Hook]

(Haha, yea though nigga, thats that shit though
You mothafuckas need to hear the shit he spitting though
But you don't hear it though, you just some little punk mothafuckas man
He spitting that real Crestside Sawyer Street playa
Mothafuckas I don't give a fuck kuz I'm hitting this shit man, haha, biatch biatch biatch!)

Cause now I got my chance, to speak my opinion freely
They need to fit on blinders cuz these fools dont want to see me
I'm poppin like a preemy, sometimes I wear a beanie
Its on like that told ya cause that doja got me dreaming
When fools be pimpatraten
It's causin me frustration
And there's no hesitation
In a snitch assassination
Mac Mall is just a youngsta, hustla, thugsta
But if you fiend for dope ass raps, fool I'mma pluck ya
And them mothafuckas, them brothas
Is from another planet
They must don't understand it, how they take they life for granted
So tell me, can you really fuck with this young buck?
I take you on a ride in the trunk side up
And with luck, maybe they can find ya, and sign ya
Off as a loss cause you toss of my penis
Breathing if you live, make dibs on the woodbox
I be kicking tha rocks and shit, and don't sport the dreadlocks

[Hook][Too $hort]
What?
You say what?
The president did what?
Ah man, that's hey, that's all good baby
He got rid of the player haters too?
Ah man, we need to declare this a national holiday
We gonna call this Players Holiday
Ant B-Z what up man?

[Ant Banks]
Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it

[Mac Mall]
It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west
It's just a Player Holiday

1 - Today's the day the Players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
Cause you know it's gonna be a lovely day

2 - Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
(A lovely day)
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

[Too $hort]
January 1 the year 2000
We gettin' all the money and we ain't through clownin'
You can tell everybody that stays around your way
Today is the official Player's Holiday
Short Dog I'm lovin' every minute of it
Cause pimpin's been around since the beginning of it
We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin'
Buy some breezys and we kickin'
And Cap what you doin?

[Captain Save Em]
I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Ant Banks]
Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown

[Rappin 4-tay]
None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days

Repeat 2

[Mac Mall]
Mama used to put my clothes on layaway
Now I'm dipped everyday and every C-note got big face
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up
Gettin' paid what we can, Short Dog and Ant Banks
Mac Mall do it big on a Players Holiday, yeah[Intro]

Yadadimean?

[Hook]* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

[Quincy Jones]
Starry night.. an unknown creation
Written by, and from the archives of 2Pac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh

A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged, your life..

[Mac Mall]
Yeah, game laid down by Q, you know what I'm saying?
Vocals by Rasheeda, fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-C y'all, Mr. M-A-C Mall

[Hook: Rasheeda]
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us

[Mac Mall]
Uhh, uhh.. watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
And speak the truth on every thing I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life.. to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum calling soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold and dark and deep like the universe, but nah don't start
It's for your entertainment but it's my life y'all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause
But when you give your all, it's like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When your name is hot it's all love, the world is yours
But when you fall off, you get ignored

CHORUS

[Mac Mall]
You on the cover of the magazine, flossing on the TV screen
Toasting with your champagne, playin life like a game
Loaded in the limousine, love to hear the fans scream
Swimming with the sharks now, ain't no love - money king
People got they hands out but ain't nobody lending hands
Can you really blame them for trying to get what they can?
Late night, bright lights, lust and lies
And anything goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose your soul and who knows what you'll find
But go ahead man we all want to shine...
But go ahead man we all want to shine...

CHORUS

[Mac Mall]
There you have it..
You know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
You know to hold this microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
You know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy 2Pac did for sure
And he gave that to me
But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and your dream, you know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart
So sometime it's cold and it's dark, but it's raw
And that's how I'mma bring it to you every time, you know?

CHORUS (fades out)[Miami Talking]
Real big up in this bitch
Stupid doo doo dumb, gorilla milk in It
And I'm talking to you niggas who're as happy
As a faggot in a tree full of dicks
It's one love, to nobody what's really going on
One love to nobody, stupid doo doo dumb
We at the party, unnh let's kill em off
Dre & Mall make a bitch cough

[Mac Dre]
It started on a bright morning in 1997
I was in my SS Chevy y'all, I-80 doing one-eleven
Barking on my faulty phone, fresh new fit Maurice Malone
Burning tongue feeling hella numb, stupid doo doo dumb off 151
Honking at every ho that pass me, I'm hella nasty boy I need chassy
I'm the type of brother that'll fuck your mother
With a Magnum rubber and leave it on the cover, and won't love her
Aw naw, all a nigga want is long jaw
It goes down where I'm from
How we come?
Stupid doo doo dumb

[Hook: Mac Mall]
When your chassy getting nasty playing with her pearl tongue
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Four fingers in a pussy cutty gone use your thumb
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
When you're hitting it from the back and you smell sometin' sometin'
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Or when she's slurping on my dick and she starts to hum
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb

[Mac Dre]
This is a brief description for those who don't know Dre
I'll go bad on bitches like that nigga OJ
Dig down broads and get blew at the telly
And don't see nothing wrong, like that fool R. Kelly
I serve cock like Julian St. Jox
Asshole naked getting blew in my socks
I'm the type of nigga that do thangs to big thangs
A super freak like that man Rick James
Adina Howard couldn't Freak Like Me
When I was in the pen I used to beat my meat
But now I'm on the streets hitting hella skins
Fuck a bitch so good she got to tell her friends
Tearing shit up making noise and with d-Con, that hoodrat poison
From city to city, town to town, stupid doo doo dumb is how we get down

[Hook 2: Mac Mall]
When you're in your own hood and they ask you where you're from
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Dick longer then my Caddy off 151
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Another hit of this shit and you gone bust your lungs
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
When the babbi hella flabby can't make a playa cum
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb

[Mac Dre]
I'm hotter then fish grease, slicker than thick grease
A chump on the strap I'm serving the six-peace
Slick with this shit like spit on a gold tooth
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb when I finish the cold booth
Crest Sida, hoo rida, servin on suckas who try to
Front with fake raps, man I break backs
And I make snaps when I shake craps
Straight caps and lots of Bay game cause
It's a Bay thang with young Mac Dre, I say thangs
That make yo brain trip, refrain from lame shit and some can't hang with
That game I bring and slang on dope tracks
I lace the lame and tame with ho slaps
I'm so fat, when I'm on the microphone
Stupid dumb making' em leave the mic at home

[Hook 3: Mac Mall]
When you off dog food and yo nose start to run
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Fuck your sister so good that your mammy got sprung
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Head was when I first met her, all teeth no tongue
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Crest Sidas in the house, punk bitch we on one
Stupid doo doo dumb! Stupid doo doo dumb!

[Miami Talking Till Fade][Intro: Too Short]
Send a shout out to the homie Pac
Know you out there somewhere right now writing rhymes man, laying tracks
Straight love, you know what I'm saying always man
We had never forgot about 2Pac, you know, that's our boy till the end

From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac
From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh, pimp game impecable
Work game incredible (how many songs did he do)
Nine songs a day, no less than four
A rap legend, an icon, a reptible
Last time I seen him was at my Rapper's Ball video
Pac you'll be proud of me pimpin', I'm doing my best
Not only the Bay, but I'm holding down the West
And I just wanna thank Afeni (why)
For birthing 2Pac Shakur, the greatest rapper in history

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]
I'm glad we had a chance, to say goodbye
I shed so many tears and you changed my life
California Love baby ride or die
I can hear you, right now, Pac yelling West Side
And West it is, we got the world going dumb
We gone make 'em understand Pac where we coming from
Don't you worry homie, rest in peace
We appreciate your love, let your soul run free

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Look into the hearts of men, every pumping valve
Man I wish we had 2Pacalypse now
Like you, I wanna make the whole world love me
You let me know, only God can judge me
I got tears in my eyes as I write this verse
The whole Bay know you were hyphy first
You've been gone, we gon stand strong
Immortalized, the legend lives on

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes

[Verse 4: Mistah Fab]
This is for the great Amaru
God knew, that you, would ride through the ghettos of the world and provide food
For hopeless youth, dope feinds with dope to use
The way that you spoke your views gave hope to dudes
2Pac, the legendary Shakur
Makaveli the Don, a prophet I'm sure
And '96 man it dont seem like it's been
I can picture you rolling up in your 500 Benz

[Verse 5: Mac Mall]
You gave me love on the ghetto scene
Put me on a million TV screens, with you
I remember drinking liqour at century clubs
Watching superstars sworn over Thug Life
You took a youngin from the Crest Side world wide
Real thizzness, I was family when you died
I'm a real outlaw and I'mma ride til the end of time
And when I see you on the other side
I crack the cap on the Henny
And Big Back, would I lie?

[Verse 6: Band-Aide of Dem Hoodstarz]
All eyes on me, dear mama, its me against the world
You know I get around like your brendas little girl
Blast me, no im not telling you the blasphemy
Pac was a [?], his death was a tragedy

[Verse 7: Scoot of Dem Hoodstarz]
Come with me, hail mary to the soldiers
Spit at the cameras, flipping off the rollers
I swear you made a nation full of thugs, put your W's up
And make the West Coast feel like one, rest in peace Pac

[Chorus: Jimmie Reign, Meilani]

[Verse 8: Turf Talk]
(Aye Pac wassup mayne)
Man I've been missing Makaveli since '96
Pac the games change, there are hella wimps
Picrture Me Rolling, one of my favorite songs
Satrin At The World Through My Rearview, Life Goes On
Had dreams of working with you, but it never happened
But I ain't trippin, we'll collaborate some day in heaven
All your albums classics, all of them slapping
Is there a heaven for a G, I know you got it cracking

[Verse 9: Lil Uno of The Pack]
Makaveli, 2Pac, he was a legend
But he in a better place, on earth we call it heaven
'96 is the year that we lost a gift
You gone, but not forgotten, and you always will be missed

[Verse 10: Lil B of The Pack]
Man, Pac, we love you, ain't nobody above you
You music touched us, and the people we buzzing
It's all about Pac, yeah the angel with the broken wings
Rose from concrete, he's still here is what it seems

[Verse 11: Young L of The Pack]
Stand troops, recognize the truth
Here lies the dude who lived rough and died for you
Took slugs and spilt his blood to lace the youth
And told young niggas to get up and face the blues
Cause it's a thugs life, everyday is what we do
Love life, believe and you'll see it through
So to my brother Pac make a place for me with you
I'mma represent you, till I reach the tool

[Chorus: Ray Luv, James "D-Train" Williams, Martha Wash]

[Verse 12: Baby Bash]
He used to clown around, when he came around with the underground
Hit the V-Town with Kyrie on some thunder pounds
Even directed the video (Mac Mall)
He was on some major shit way back then but we didn't know
How a genius get to work, on the herb and the purp
Probably looking down, smiling now on some purp
He had love for us Mexicans
Loves to see young playas stacking Benjamins

[Verse 13: Nump Trump]
I wake up and blaze one for Pac every morning
It's Mr. I Got Grapes, picture me rolling
Everybody knows this, or knew what it was
When we found out Pac passed, it was so messed up
We was crushed, couldn't beleive it, Gorilla-Pinos and all
But we still slap your album so the music lives on
When tomorrow comes, we still ride for Makaveli
From the low-lows to scrapers, you smell me

[Verse 14: Shock G]
Pac, he didn't mean to die, he got in over his head
Died for you but wasn't trying to be dead
He went round and round, cause there wasn't nothing better to do
What could be better than dying for you
Split the blunt, put the Hennessey in the cup
Let me see ya, let me see ya toss it up
We all feel 2Pac, now that he's gone
But recognize those alive who sing the same song, c'mon

[Chorus: Kimberlee Payton, Isa S. Chu, Laura Lane, Nancy Zumwalt][Verse 1:]
When I first glanced at ya, I knew I had to have ya
Fly chassis with a sassy manner
She hold herself in a high standard
And hella suckers in the hood ain't never ran in her
Young tender, thoroughbred, born winner
I know you're busy, but you need to holler at your nigga
I won't scare you away with fast talk and game
I wanna know if I can have ya, but I start witcha name
Who you with? you say that you ain't got no mayn?
I'm tryin to tell you, girl, I let you star on my team
A play-maker, make a player slow his pace up
The type of face a brother wanna see when he wake up
She works hard nine to five, sometimes more
Cuz go to school at night, you see she got big goals
And I don't wanna bring you down, I just wanna come along
Make you moan, make a home, a place that we can both grow old
See, let this truth be told, I'm tryin to leave that fast life alone
To find a woman of my own, so we can get together and build
A foundation that's real and everyday I make you feel like a mill'

[Hook:]
You got me wide open
But you ain't even knowin

{Shima}
You ain't knowin that I'm wide open
You got me goin and it's showin
That I want you
You ain't feelin me
I'm caught up indeed
You got me slippin and I'm trippin
Off the things you do

[Verse 2:]
You think I'm runnin drag, but I ain't even mad
I bet you all my cash I be the realest that you had
I wanna treat you lav', but you can't see that half
I'm tryin to keep you smilin if you just give me a chance
At times you make me laugh, you got me wide open
You think it's all a front, swear you ain't even knowin
If I was runnin drama on ya
I woulda bend in the wind, baby, hittin corners
Instead I'm standin right beside you like you know I'm 'posed to
Keepin composure, while most fools be in your face just tryin to get over
I see you know my style, me and my mob is wild
I hear your friends say I'm not trustworthy
But if you wait a while I shut that madness down
Prove to you once and for all that I'm deservin
Of your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, your time
If it's cool, boo, then give me a sign
Now I ain't tryin to rush you, but a/s, a/p
Keep a Mac on your mind and holler at me
I say ain't tryin to rush you, but a/s, a/p
Keep a Mac on your mind and holler at me

{Shima}
See I been waitin all my life
To find someone like you
And now that it's finally you and me
There's no time to lose
You're on my mind seven days a week
No matter what they say
Cause even though your style is wild
I like the way you do your thing
Baby, I'm wide open, too
I'm lovin me somethin new[Mac Dre]
When Dre rap you hear hand claps and toe taps
I rock off iPod no mo show DATs
On stage gettin filmed by Justin Lomax
Get off stage feel like I ran about four laps
Get off stage get paid about four racks
Meanwhile my freestyles kill yo wrote raps
Fresh cat in net backs no pro backs or throwbacks
I'm slept on but no match, get stepped on like floor mats
I'll cut cut my dreads off get a high top, let 'em grow back
If I wanna I'm gonna, bitch you know that
Fans no I'm fonky they want me on they Kodak
Feds don't want me cuz they know I ain't gone go back
40 toes, four hoes, down like four flats
Bring me back some backwoods baby, four packs
She bought my Jordans in Portland and got charged no tax
I spit fully auto, full throttle with no naps

[Hook 2x: Mac Dre]
Hoes ain't dumb they gone come and ho willingly
But broke ones wit no funds is no fun, they killin me
We Heros, when we roll, we roll wit artillary
I'm Dregan the one that knock pill for pillary(2x)

[Mac Mall]
When Mall flows the hoes go postal
And thugs go nuts like we handin out bundles
Promotas have my money cuz I got cutthoat muscle
Crack a smerk helmet, won't argue or tussle
Mack The Most, but u can call me Russell
Thizzin, keep fly Asian women comin in and out my billin
Dre and me is boss mackin to the highest degree
Triple C beast, my name rings in Berlin Germany
Keep a bitch servin me with upmost curtousy
When Mall move smooth like I'm doin, Thia Chi
Maybe its that country club blood in me
That make my mouthpiece so deadly
This pay style trick never treat
(?) Street pedigry got ya scared ta breathe
But my backwood burnin paraqui purple trees
I'm mean

[Hook 2x: Mac Mall]
Hoes ain't dumb when they come they ho willingly
But broke ones wit no funds is no fun, they killin me
We heros, when we roll, we roll wit artillary
Mallenium, I work a fast bitch for a mill or three
