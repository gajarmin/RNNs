[Indo G]
Fresh out the whome, 1973
A baby boy, I'm ready for war
Now this just can't be
Wit my daddy
He don't love us, just too young to know
I love you mama, work real hard
It got us out the ghetto
No more dependin' on my mama
See I'm a cra... man
And I got kids of my own
But if I call she there
Somehow, someway
Indo gone shine like diamonds
Imortalize to my rise dodgin' demons and phantoms
Realize your situation, ain't gettin' no better
They building more and more prisons
I wrote my nation a letter
Conversation and hation
I talked to god last night
Like from last saw 6 phantom
And I'ma lie in twilight
Zonin', think I'm gonin'
Maybe bro ho
Was I talkin' on that level
Crusafix on my door
Race em', rece em', racin'
Got my heart pacin'
Listne learn it's my turn
I'd a free mase em'

Chorus x1

[Gangsta Boo]
The late generation 6
Never caught up in clicks
How can you haters
Claim you real
Turn in (??)
But anyway that stories old
Let me kick in the loot
I'm tellin' heavy understand me, baby this Gangsta Boo
Now all you wannabe's
Claimin' platnum LP's
I can't believe all you fakers in the rap industry
You stay at home at your moms house
Stackin' your cheese
Whatever punk, I'm on my own
Still stackin' g's
I'm young in ages
Only the hair trick, I've been everywhere
I'm takin' flights to NY
Lookin' for somethin' to wear
I don't be carin' what you say
I'm hypnotized for your mind
I state it fly
Sippin' wine
Wit my 6's behind
Call up Chris
I'm in crystal
What you got for me baby
Me and Paul comin' over
Range Rover we're reelin'
X-O through the door
Cause we got plenty more
We be the one with the flow
Hurtn' all I fall

Chorus x1

[Indo G]
Triggas bleed the same blood
We killin' each other for colors and lovers and others
We can talk a long time
Smoke a blunt and touch faces
Rull laces, talk, pimp, and no slippin' and take it
To upper places
Like do you have a strong mind
What's your purpose in life
Begin it to end in my potion, I'm steady coastin'
Bustas look me in my eye
Turn around and throw crosses
Talkin' shit, your jealous bustas come and go like my (??)
Toss and turn, and burn and yurnin' for freedom in my sleep
I'm bout' to lose my mind
But them angels watchin' over me
Three strikes and now your gone
To the penetentiary
WOrd is born, they won't capture me
I'm on a mission, I'm wishin'
Up on a star
Workin' on a meal ticket
While I'm eatin' caviar
I lie please
Bless my soul on my journey through hell
I know my bothers my keeper
My brother got a street sweeper
We gonna blast these devils
I know you comin' to get me
But when I die, I'm takin' six of ya'll wit me
Killuminati
I got my soldiers
And I'm ready for war
Check mate, rockafella
Now they jumpin' in the door

Chorus x1

And leave your body for the chalk
Never talk is what you told me, homies all up in ya bizz
Spread the word on where you live, and all the shit a nigga did
Yo I ain't did no fuckin dirt, I hope nobodys in the trunk
I shipped some keys over seas, might have flower mixed with funk
I call the police, 9-1-1, "Theres been a murder on my set"
When they pull up on the set we pop them thangs and then we jet
On the low is how I keep it, if you want yo blood to spill
Run yo mouth off in the streets and pull yo gun and shoot to kill
If you real, if you realla then a muthaphukkin gang
On the block is where you hang, throw them muthaphukkin thangs

[Verse: Lil' Blunt]
Here's something for the brothers that can flow
And go where the P.O.L.I.C.E. don't grow
A place where the brother C.L.V. is smoking chicken
But when they smoking that chicken then their nines start to clicking
So yo withstand from the drama yo here's something for yo' mama
Can't tell you what to do or not do, do what you wanna
Don't worry about creeping just chiefing on a half
The only time a brother shuts up thinking, won't care
This type of chilling mode will make a person wonder
If this was an everyday thing a lot of people wouldn't be under
So I'm legit, keep myself from having fits
Stay calm, feeling numb with a fat philly blunt lit
Now I'm feeling straight, falling back
Bottom's up, smoke a sack
Conjac is on the deck
In my lap's a twelve pack
Now you tell Blunt how he living
Don't have a worry in the world
I'm chilling like a villain

[Verse Two: Indo G]
Yeah I just keep on kicking lyrics from the one into the two
Clocking, jocking make them duckets, not just me but the whole crew
So just sit back and relax and let the rhythm cold take over
Moving and grooving the party people, taking 'em to a higher level
Yo try to C.L.V. take it from me boy I'm gon' tell ya
You ask me what it is, just shut the fuck up I'ma tell ya
To see if you don't know you must be smoking, 'C' standings for 'Chilling'
The L it stands for 'Like A' and the 'V' it stands for 'Villain'
There ya have it I'm chilling like a villain, don't try to take the broken beat
The first one to jump up the first one to catch a clip in ya butt bro
I'm doing the kind of music girlies love to freak to
Bringing the bass and kicking it with the brothers in my crew
Making the tape but bullets will break a sucker [?]
Stabbing and capping, flipping and flapping, yep I shut your lip up
If you're chilling, where you go? The liquor sto'? Texaco?
Get a 40 or a six pack that's the only way to G.O
P me up I like [?] hot
Culture got the [?] liquor
Give me a brew, ya ask for four big girls cause I'm all for down with chilling
When I down a fourth I know it makes me wanna chill
My other brothers drank it and it makes them wanna kill
Hey man that ain't the subject for right now cause I'm top billing
I won't give up, no not tonight cause I'm just chilling
I'm chilling like a villain

[Tommy III]
I lay my head in Memphis, where they be killin' drug dealin'
Niggas get shot out chillin',takin' up smoke just to cope
Wid the fact that a nigga can't survive if he don't got a gat
Leave a nigga nigga flat on his back it's us
Thirteen to the third power, SPC and Street Smart's in this thugs
In my veins, it's cold water
If ain't murder, it's manslaughter
Steppin' out the door all a nigga finna hear is gunshots

In the South yo mouth can get you killed

Got my heart pacin'
Listne learn it's my turn
I'd a free mase em'

Chorus x1

[Gangsta Boo]
The late generation 6
Never caught up in clicks
How can you haters
Claim you real
Turn in (??)
But anyway that stories old
Let me kick in the loot
I'm tellin' heavy understand me, baby this Gangsta Boo
Now all you wannabe's
Claimin' platnum LP's
I can't believe all you fakers in the rap industry
You stay at home at your moms house
Stackin' your cheese
Whatever punk, I'm on my own
Still stackin' g's
I'm young in ages
Only the hair trick, I've been everywhere
I'm takin' flights to NY
Lookin' for somethin' to wear
I don't be carin' what you say
I'm hypnotized for your mind
I state it fly
Sippin' wine
Wit my 6's behind
Call up Chris
I'm in crystal
What you got for me baby
Me and Paul comin' over
Range Rover we're reelin'
X-O through the door
Cause we got plenty more
We be the one with the flow
Hurtn' all I fall

Chorus x1

[Indo G]
Triggas bleed the same blood
We killin' each other for colors and lovers and others
We can talk a long time
Smoke a blunt and touch faces
Rull laces, talk, pimp, and no slippin' and take it
To upper places
Like do you have a strong mind
What's your purpose in life
Begin it to end in my potion, I'm steady coastin'
Bustas look me in my eye
Turn around and throw crosses
Talkin' shit, your jealous bustas come and go like my (??)
Toss and turn, and burn and yurnin' for freedom in my sleep
I'm bout' to lose my mind
But them angels watchin' over me
Three strikes and now your gone
To the penetentiary
WOrd is born, they won't capture me
I'm on a mission, I'm wishin'
Up on a star
Workin' on a meal ticket
While I'm eatin' caviar
I lie please
Bless my soul on my journey through hell
I know my bothers my keeper
My brother got a street sweeper
We gonna blast these devils
I know you comin' to get me
But when I die, I'm takin' six of ya'll wit me
Killuminati
I got my soldiers
And I'm ready for war
Check mate, rockafella
Now they jumpin' in the door

Chorus x1
