[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster
The money turned my noodles into pasta
The money turned my tuna into lobster
They want to do me I maneuver like a mobster

[Verse 1]
4 A.M. I'm on the north side of Philly
Riding around like these haters don't want to kill me
It's a shame how they hate on me you gotta feel me
I started out with a dollar and got a milli
I'm like do it for the gram ho, do it for the gram ho
She don't want to bust it I say do it for them bands yo
I say do it for them bands fucking with that broke nigga you should do it for your man
Lately I've been on the low with a ho that you probably know
Took her to the crib and met momma right at the door
Momma started smiling like momma I got to go
I done took so many trophies to momma my momma know
I said a real nigga, I get that money pay them bills nigga
My momma told me "you a real nigga"
And I be hanging with them real killers
Now what a feeling when you looking at the latest whip and knowing you can cop it
Or looking at the baddest bitch and knowing you could pop it
The youngest nigga in my city doing it, I got it
On another level with Benjamin and money is the topic
Lord

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]
I put my jeweler on his feet
Hundred thou I used to do that every week
Never sleep it's funny how it never speak
You see a foreign in my city that was me

Verse [2]
That was us, never sweet
We went to war, niggas riding down the street
Popping that pistol they talking they never did
Dropping the nickel with something that never cease
I've been sitting on that money like a chair
I've been getting to that money all year
All year and my niggas all here
But we started from the bottom we was selling hard squares
Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain, I'm ready
Switching lanes in that Mulsanne like I'm Andretti
I do the Balmain, Balenciaga, no Giuseppe
If they sleep on Meek Milly I kill these niggas like I was Freddy
I eat that pussy like a monster
She gon' ride this dick, she need a sponsor
You could tell I'm Philly from my posture
And we be whipping coca like it's pasta
I be on money, 2 milly 4 milly no I need more money
I get that "see a bad bitch and be like how you doing" money
They be like how you doing honey oh

[Hook] + [Post-Hook][Intro]
Ain't this what they've been waiting for? You ready?

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she try'na bless me like I said, "Achoo"
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please before them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawling, went straight to walkin' with foreigns in my garage
All foreign bitches menaging, fucking, sucking, and swallowing
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga I'm fly-er
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' bout my niggas then what you talkin' bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve fuck nigga
[BEAT CHANGE]
Hold up wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
When I bought that Aston Martin y'all thought it was rented?
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm the lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
Cause my momma need that bill money and my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke
All I know is murder, when it comes to me
I got young niggas that's rollin' I got niggas throwin' b's
I done did the DOAs I done did the KODs
Every time I'm in that bitch I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hanging out that drop head, I'm riding down on Collins
They let my nigga earn back home that young nigga be wildin'
We young niggas and we mobbin' like Batman and we're Robin
This 2-door Maybach, with my seat all reclinin'
I'm that real nigga what up, real nigga what up
If you ain't about that murder game then pussy nigga shut up
If you diss me in yo' raps, I'll get your pussy ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA, at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet, like that little engine I could
Boy I slide down on your block, bike on twelve o'clock
And they be throwing dueces on the same nigga they watch
And I'm the king of my city cause I'm still calling them shots
And these lames talking that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hating on me, hoes waiting on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money have ya friends turn into enemies
And when there’s beef I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go from 40 ain't no 10 a key, hold up
Broke nigga turn rich, love the game like Mitch
And if I leave you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was something 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feeling like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone[Produced by Arch The Boss & Yung Berg]

[Intro (Throughout): Alicia Keys]
You should say it right now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

[Hook: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Rahmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

[Hook]

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Its a heart for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's crying
Its trust for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's lying[Intro]
Lickwood means "rewind", gunshot means "forward"
You requested it so we rewind

Omelly what's up
Small side one-eight BH we straight
North side, Berks what up
Philly!

[Verse]
I got enemies got a lot of enemies
I don't really fuck with these niggas in the industry
Know a couple niggas from the hood want to finish me
And put me on a t-shirt RIP and memory
So I'm riding around with a drum and a Glock
On the gram niggas said I couldn't come to my block
So I came through that bitch me myself in a drop
Niggas know they touch me bllllrrrrr something get dropped
Man I don't bang with these suckers I don't play with no hoes
I do the walk through for 60 and get like 80 a show
And I don't got out no single I thinking maybe they know
Meek Milly realest to do it and I can play at the floor ya heard
I got enemies got a lot of enemies
We fucking to Dej Loaf me you and some Hennessy
She gon' suck me off 'til she drain me of my energy
Flexing, it be fucking with these niggas mentally
Is Instagram hurting your heart nigga
VS stones on me still work in the dark nigga
Hundred and six shots pull up and park niggas
Jump in the big drop button to start nigga
Murder was the case that they gave us spanked it
Real niggas back in style they should thank us
All these rap ass niggas really wanksters
Real recognize the real you a stranger
Hoes sell their souls for some baller alert
Niggas and they fake jewels need a frauding alert
Put me on watch buster tell 'em all what its worth
Bet they say couple milli Audemar with the works
New roll bust down call that Big Meech
Every time I drop shit hot fish grease
Every time you drop it is not that heat
Called your album seven days boy that shit weak
Motivating the hood still hot in the burbs
Still getting this money they think we got them birds
Every time I spit that's a thousand a word
Spoke it right to the system they say its power in words
Nigga we chosen we was chosen
Me Omelly had them hoes in now its Rollses
Back to back screaming told ya, niggas owed us
And they said they would expose us never showed us
Fuck them niggas though
I got enemies got a lot of enemies
They was just cooling with me hating call them frienemies
I ain't really tripping we got arms like a centipede
Cause if I lose my cool I could turn them into memories
I'm gone I said I'm gone
Be the same niggas hating on the Chasers mad we ain't put them on
Fuck them niggas though[Produced by Metro Boomin & Southside]

[Intro: Meek Mill]

I only shop if its in blood nigga
And hold that chopper like its a grudge nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Count up that money they know we balling for sure

Them bad bitches be flocking soon as we come in the door
Young Philly nigga fuck a check up on your main ho
Busting down the Rollie diamond dealing like a rainbow
I do what I want to I go places that you can't go
Leaning in my motherfucking Phantom like a [?]
I fuck all my bitches on the jet, jet, jet, jet
You fuck all your hoes and pay a check, check, check, check
She could bless the kid out of respect, pect, pect, pect
Let her count the money now she wet, wet, wet, wet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Look at all these young niggas, drug dealers
Lookin' like we came up on the plug nigga

And then buy your bitch a bag straight out of love nigga
I'm talking young niggas, drug dealers
Swerving in the Phantom sipping mud nigga
This the hit they love nigga

[Hook][Produced by Sap]

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
All that ass, Lord have mercy
All that champagne, these bitches thirsty
Verserchy, no hold up, I meant Versace
I prolly pull up Roberto over Cavalli
Puffin' on Cali, prolly out in the valley
Sippin' on something drowsy, bitches twerkin' like Miley
Twerk, twerk for a real nigga sellin' work
Promise I won't tell a word
I been on that trill shit, way back
North Philly nigga, but I'm laid back
Get shot in your head drivin' your Maybach
Homey D Clown know I don't play that
Sippin' dirty, riding dirty, I say hi to thirty
Call your dog,  I call my dawg and he'll buy a birdy
Try to school me, I'm getting out here early
Dope dealer, Puma life, back of this soccer jersey
Mink draggin', tell PETA I'm swaggin
All these karats like I'm tryna lure in a rabbit
Just to put it, on my jacket
What you doin? Doin' fashion

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I walk with a limp and I talk with a slur
I might wear every single chain and mix it up with my fur
I might get every single drink and mix it up til I blur
I tell the bitch get on my lap, but don't you get on my nerves
I need that bag full of green like I lawnmow it
John Doe and all Sean Doe it
And I keep it G, yeah, I ground floor it
And I'm pound blowin'
If her pussy good then I might one, two, three, round four it
Got her down for it
Yeah, nigga overthink, never under stress
Yeah, I understand, your girl over, I'm so unimpressed
Yeah, and she tryna fuck me raw, unprotect
But if I don't have that rubber on it I feel under dressed
Yeah, and I got money bags under my eyes, ho, cause I ain't sleep
They all Goyard too cause I ain't cheap
Finally Famous Aura Gold is my I-N-C
And I put everything in motion like I-N-G
And when we flyin' private you could bring the gun on with us
I got this freak to 3rd base, she tryna run home with us
And I got comma on comma on comma on comma... on comma
And I ain't talking about no run on sentence
Yeah, nigga hot headed so I need that Chings Chili
Put my P up on her head like that bitch is reppin' Philly
And I wheelie in that pussy like my nigga Meek Milly
On my way to meet millis
Lawyer drafting up the deep deep dealies
I got rich decided that ain't rich enough
When I did it big, bitch, I decided that ain't big enough
Dead Pres, who you diggin up?
Who that nigga that you hating on, but just  can't get enough?
Fuck, the jig is up, little bitch

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I'm like Madoff but I made off, scheming on niggas' payoff
I never take a day off, your stash is short like Adolf, Hitler
You should lay off on the gangsta talk cause you're fake, dog
You never pushed no yay, dawg, ain't see no keys like Ray Charles
Me and Meek in the Maybach, we get Wale and take off
We got your bitch in a big house, she walk in hype like "Hey, Ross, how you doing?"
Get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
I'm at your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor
You thinkin' Khloe don't know me, I'm in the car dashin' haters
I'm in the Kardashian, get it? I'm lyin', can't I pretend?
They say fake it 'til you make it, well, let the fakin' begin
I got a bitch with fake titties, fake ass, she all in the Benz
Them titties'll prolly fall like a ball when she bend
My niggas from Harlem and Philly all get it in
Your bitch come around then we fuckin' her and her friends
Come get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
Come get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
I'm at your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor

[Outro: Meek Mill]

That sound like, but that 300 thousand nigga
I'm triple OG in my hood
These hoes call me big daddy

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Standin' on the corner in some shit that look like I payed like a million for
Blowin' the money I heard that they askin' around town what he really worth
Most of these niggas be really broke
I went the Hardaway boy had a penny first
Now these bitches gon' get this work
I tell her keep on them heels and that mini skirt
She Google my net worth, lookin' like "what is his neck worth?"
My shooters,  they shoot at your head, like the rim just to see if the net work
I land in Miami then fly out to Cali with some of my best work
You niggas so lame that my bitches won't fuck unless you cut a check first

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Pulled up in something that look like a million nigga put me up on
Ain't gotta sell it, but he say the pussy a drug that he re-up on
Spur of the moment I ball like Ginobli you bitches get D'ed up on
You mad at me go get mad at your nigga 'fore I put my sneakers on
He cop me this wrist game, now its just us at the Knicks game
I might have to take him on tour just to fuck in Australia, Brisbane
Your time is ticking you bitches will be around shorter than Vine vids
You watch your mouth or my niggas will shoot up the club like what Shyne did

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't stupid, you bitches ain't stupid
You bitches ain't stupid, is you?
Front like she tough but that bitch keep on crying
Get this bitch a tissue
For what it's worth when I took him I could tell he would never miss you
I ain't even wanna diss you, but tell me what is this bitch issue?

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Still on top, pretty bitch gang
Pussy still tight, pistol still bang
Yo nigga call me big mama
Let him eat the pussy then I dip on him

[Hook][Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Rat nigga got my chain snatched
And he didn't even get the chain back
On the news with the police, now he talking on twitter I ain't playing that
Fuck all that Meek you gotta chill shit
I be on some get a nigga killed shit
Put a hundred bands on you real quick
My Philly niggas make a movie outcha Will Smith
Oh lord oh lord what you yelling nigga
Penthouse nice fresh out the cellar nigga
All that white like what you selling nigga
My chain look like a Coogi with all these colors nigga
I be on money since nineteen, twenty
I may be twenty-one I have bout 3hunnid
And I ain't talking bout Chief Keef or Lil' Reese
But all my niggas keep heat a little piece
With a drum on that bitch no chicken all beef
For you fuck ass rappers that be talking they all sweet
Last night I hit my hood with all my chains on
Two hundred fifty thou had a Mulsanne on
A broke nigga get it from me and his pain gone
But he'll never get it from me he'll get rained on
I tell em wear it to your funeral be stuntin' while they viewing you
Everybody goons 'til we send that 32 at you
Sipping on lean with the percs pharmaceutical
Just so I can get in my bag in the studio
Headshot we ain't shooting low
So many holes in ya they gone call you Julio
Oops I mean Hole-I-O, Holyfield knows he’s broke
Shooting at your Rolls Royce turn it to the holy ghost
Holy smokes, caught the whole thing that was overdose
Overkill watched the news so I know its real

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
That's why I'm like fuck y'all niggas
Cause I ain't never trust y'all niggas
And I be like fuck y'all bitches
And I'll never cuff y'all bitches
Cause these hoes ain't loyal and niggas ain't either
When it go down you calling for hittas that you ain't feeding
You ain't real nigga
Your day ones ain't even still with you
You left them starving you an ill nigga
Same niggas you calling to kill with you
But I be in the field nigga
And when it come to money I get it
I fill up banks like Uncle Phil nigga word
Word fuck these bitches get a bird serve
Whoever got it never splurge splurge
Cause when the money going that's when all the honeys rolling
They gone kick you to the curve

[Outro: Meek Mill]
One time for Lil' Snupe R.I.P
Whole squad on that real shit
And you know I was always taught
If them niggas ain't feeding you how you going to ride for them
I was in that position
Loyalty before royalty
I tell my niggas stay down stay close to that money nigga we gon' ball forever
Dreamchasers for life[Wale]
I promised Ricky and Milly that I’ma kill it
Runnin' throughout them digits and dollars homie I'm Emmitt
I’m runnin'
I’m so 100 with every nigga I run with
Tell them niggas we coming
We fuckin' it up this summer

[Meek Mill]
And I’m stuntin' like it ain’t nothin'
Most of these niggas frontin'
I pull this Rollie from trappin'
I got this Beamer from nothin'
If they ain’t talking bout paper
Just tell them end of discussion
And now that I’m getting money
My neighbors turn to my cousins

[Wale]
Gold bottles, lot of bitches
Deep thinker, I’m sorry you're such a shallow nigga
The mind on me just shine on them, you shadow women
Ridin' with rats you niggas should be in glass slippers

[Meek Mill]
Ha, and I don’t never ask the price on it
Married to the money hater, throw some rice on it
I told my jeweler get my Muller, throw some ice on it
I treat that pussy like its Tina, I go Ike on it
Beat it up, I’m getting heated up
When I say I’m high, I ain’t talking weeded up

[Wale]
Bitch I’m talkin' G5, Teterboro, feet is up
Beaverton my sneaker game although I never be with ducks
Me and Meek, treein' up

[Meek Mill]
He lying I’m on papers
But when I knock this shit off, I'mma go and buy some Laker shit
I’m talking bout that Cali kush, We get work and Bally push
Two bad bitches in the back, they pretty everybody look

(Wale)
Bitch I’m hot as Wasabi in Abu Dhabi
In a sauna with some models, who treat it like edemame
I ain’t thugging, I ain’t robbing, I’m puffing on my broccoli
Doing 100 in a bucket, do like 20 in a ‘rari

(Meek Mill)
And I’m back on this shit again, Pressie blue like Michigan
I put on for my city I should ball with Vick and them
When I get my V12, I’ma be in Six of them
Riding round with Lou, me, and your sister, and your sister’s friend

(Wale)
Hold up
Got the fridgedest temperature on my wrist again
Shiny shit to niggas is like givin' children Ritalin
Bamma's sittin' in the pen, see you in a minute yo
And them haters went away as soon as I left Interscope

(Meek Mill)
Big money, I’m talking bad hoes
You niggas full of shit, fucking assholes
I’m in this presidential suite, I’m in my bathrobe
Counting 100 grand I pulled it from my last show
Shitting on them, something I ain’t mean to do
These hoes do anything, our wish is like a genie do
A nigga buy a point, here take the nina too
I get a chick to come and serve you like Serena do

[Wale]
I think its genius leanin' will do when you in a groove
Stuntin', I’m in the sixth
I call that shit that middle school
High as shit, I’m in a booth
Denver Nugget number 2s
And I don’t gotta front, I play these niggas like a wisdom tooth
This is where the Wizards play, this is where them bitches play
We'd have you fallin' and now you scrapin' from that Kemba shake
On the day a hater treat a nigga like he fake
That'd be the day his label treat him like a signal fade

[Meek Mill]
And I’m ballin' bitch
I’m ballin' bitch
Me, Wale, so hard - as shit
Get your budget money back, fire all your artists-es
We be burnin' everything, they label us as arsonists
If I ain't middle of the track, I'm 106 and Parkin' it
Bitch[Hook]
Kickin shit like it's FIFA, ballin like Derek Jeter
Smoking weed like it's legal, and we don't order tequila

[Verse: Quez]
10 bottles of Rose, takin shots like we Kobe
Just bought a new bezel, put it on top my Roley
Niggas sayin they ballin, them niggas they gotta show me
Them bitches want my bottle tell them hoes they gotta blow me
Them other bitches is boring, them niggas ain't important
They Louie's that you wearing they cost the same as my Jordan's
I be laughin at niggas, cause the shit be so funny
Why niggas be gettin' mad, why don't you get some money nigga
Goons with me got you niggas runnin nigga
Sparkles got this bitch lookin sunny nigga
And to think I'm a nigga from the GAT
I'm a boss I'm the one that sign the checks fuck nigga

[Hook]

[Ali]
You know I'm hella paid, you know I'm hella straight
Ciroq and lemonade, I drink it everday
I'm in the VIP them hoes keep hollin out they thirsty
I told the waitress bring me "10 bottles of Rozay"
10 bottles of water, hurry up with my order
When 3 o'clock hit I'mma be leavin with someone's daughter
Chillin out here in Florida, say she from bora bora
Say she wanted to fuck me just cause I'm in Travis Porter
Damn that was so easy, all of these hoes so easy
Starstruck when she see me she said she seen me on TV
Said she bought all my CD's, want me to sign her titties
Ask what she doin later she say she comin to see me
"We kickin shit like its FIFA", beat that pussy like speakers
Said she don't wanna fuck me, don't wanna fuck you either
Keep askin for tequila but "we don't order tequila"
And when I'm in the club I ball like Trevor Ariza

[Hook]

[Meek Mill]
Kick it like Janikowski , Flexin in my new Audi
Bitches they wanna fuck me, haters they talkin' bout me

All my bitches Halle Barry bad nigga!

You owe paper. Fuck nigga I blow paper
You show paper, I know paper. I'm spendin like I grow paper
I'm spendin' that on the road paper, I don't touch my bank account
My neck cost me 100 racks and my wrist cost me the same amount
10 bottles of Rosé, killin' these bitches like OJ
Y'all niggas on crab shit, I should sprinkle some Old Bay
Weather man he seen my jewels he said it might be a cold day
I'm ballin' hard and you on the bench y'all sucka niggas get no play

[Hook]

[Strap]
We kickin shit no soccer ball. These niggas broke no gwap at all

Yo click full of them scary people, we ball hard like Derek Jeter
I'm in Onyx. I'm throwin money
Can't believe I'm havin fun with them dead people
Fuck what ya heard we don't love them hoes
True Religions them my old clothes
10 bottles of that red shit, in the VIP with a red bitch
I'm high as fuck I can't see. My blunts long they lanky
My diamonds goin crazy from my earrings to my pinky
Shake the bottle up pop it on lil mama. Bank account got stupid commas
Check me out smokin marijuana, don't even choose if you like the drama
Louie V all around my waist, naked hoes all around my face
Need a million up on the plate, fuck the haters I'mma stack the cake

Uh, go hard for that paper so I can get what I want
Stood in the back, I couldn't fit in the front
Now I pull in the back, my whip sit in the front
With no roof on that bitch, I let it flip in the trunk
Like it's gymnastics, I know magic
Caught with the bastards, early gymnastics
I never had a master but I done mastered
The art of getting money in a timely fashion

[Talking: Omelly]
You know we still...remain real nigga, you know, niggas be playin'
You gotta see 'em, you gotta see me man
When you see me you keep the same energy that you had
You know what I'm saying?
I got blood all over me, you know, when, when you niggas pop shit
Just know that y'll gotta see us, We not gunna tweet you niggas or nothin'
You have to see us. You see what I'm saying?
I mean that's a nigga jaw right there today. You gotta see us
And it could have got worse but, you know, these niggas be pussies
You don't even got to take it there. It's just how I be feelin' , I don't know
Shoot, just keep the same energy
Whenever you say something about any Dreamchaser, nigga, just keep the same energy when you see us and man
Anybody, we ain't got no picks over here. Dreams worth more than money

[Rapping: Meek Mill, Verse 2]
Uh, gimme some levels, turn it up
Uh, they sayin' that I talk too much money
But maybe cause I saw too much money
I can't chase around no broads with no regard to touch money
So if it ain't about no paper, get them all the fuck from me
Young dummies, uh, realest, richest nigga in my town
Yeah, if you ain't come with your pistol then get from 'round here
Cause I'm the ref. with the whistle, you out of bounds here
And this time on my Sky-dweller say “The crowns near"
Cause it's crowns there, you hear broke niggas talkin' that never sound fair
Be tryna broker and bargain something that's not there
I'm barely sleeping, having million dollar nightmares
I'm right c'here, finna kill 'em, kill 'em all, they shi-shi-shivering
I think they mad I put on my hood, fuckin' Zimmermans
Racist when they tie me down with cases
Cause my hand got dealed all aces, and I make their yearly savings
On the days end, that I stayed in, First year I came in, Pop stars got came in

[Talking: Meek] (laughing)
Hold up, hold up, I don't know I said first year I came in, they got came in

[Rapping: Meek, Verse 3]
Basic bitches can't sit with us
And none of these niggas ain't really rich as us
We swore that that money’ll never get to us
We swore that these bitches'll never get to us
But now I'm feeling like I'm made for this shit
And loyalty go to the grave for this shit
And where the feeling you can't pay for this shit
All my niggas pay for this shit
Cause we already rich and you know I'm the shit
Got fifty niggas with me, they got Rollies on they wrist
Uh, I want everything my niggas want except for the hoes they fuckin'
Roll that window down and nigga we get to bustin'
Who that right there? Turn around they fuss if [?] truckin'
It don't matter, you know how we rockin', we thuggin'
Uh, living this life, getting it right
That shit y'll niggas talk about we did it twice
G-5 eggs in back this the life
Look at my man's wrist there, you see it's bright
Uh, rollie on wrist, ice on neck
21st and Berks, this the whole set
My nigga Dean, he was catchin' wreck
Bending corners on niggas, 50 in the Tec
We got 30 in the Macs, 80 in the Myags..

[Talking: Meek Mills]
(laughing) I can’t...I need like a basic beat

[Rapping: Meek, Verse 4]
[?] thinking how I got here
Locin’ low and tosin’ pussy you was not there
Holdin’ never foldin’, we was on the top tier
Shackled to our ankles, it was like a nightmare
You ever wash out your drawers the same water you shit
Doing your push-ups right on the floor where you piss
Cellies with niggas that went to war with the strip
You gotta rumble with ‘em nighttime down to the mornin’ and shit
I’m trying to tell them...(laughing) they can’t get no more of that right there
(laughing) they can’t get no more of that
I seen a nigga get murdered for a half a bird
Headshot, cat licked his brains off the curb
Before I had this paper always had an urge
To ball in ‘em sixes on them like, Julius served
I moved to the ‘burbs, but I’m still in the hood
And I ain’t gotta rock a vest ‘cause really I’m good
And I should shout out my connects, like really I should
Like Death Row and 9’5, Meek Milly I Suge
But I’m cocky as Pac, ice hockey the watch
Green Mercedes, brown butter be broccoli the drop
‘Cause them winters was cold, the beef from broccoli was hot
We was sellin’ them O’s, still getting watch from the cops
Federal papers, indictments, nothing was righteous
Praying that Papi don’t grow up to be just like us
Praying them people don’t judge us and try to life us
I did it for all my niggas, we ballin’ no they don’t like us
And they wanna kill us, if they could one of the realest
But they can’t find us on a wood watching the Clippers like a Kingpin
(Huh? Yeah) But for this rapping swear to God I just wanted to be a Kingpin

[Talking: Takbar]
At the bottom of the joint put some “Motivational uses only” man
No hatin’ man we wanna see the whole Philly win
Ya'm sayin? Like we wanna see when we out of town
A bunch of niggas from Philly holdin’ it down too man
What part of Philly you from man? Put on it for the whole city man, everybody
Turn up, Put down the guns and pick up some money
(I’mma keep mines and keep the money, yeah you know what I mean)
(I ain’t mad at nothin’ tho)

[Rapping: Meek Mill, verse 5]
Man, you ready?
I think the D.A wanna murder me
As they swore me in I spelled my name nervously
Feeled like I committed perjury
‘Cause this time they talkin’ ‘bout in here, it ain’t me
And next time I bring my son to court so he can see
How they wanna murder his Daddy, I murder the Caddy
When I’m on the roads to the riches no words for the Navi’
Should I make a left or right,? ‘Cause nothing was never right
We’s infatuated with bustin’ guns and sellin’ white
I remember Snupe’s momma called me from the scene
No life in his body, blood on his jeans
Couldn’t believe it, one of the youngest in my regime
Got murdered and I’m feelin’ like it’s ‘cause of me
Was it the fame that I brought to him? Huh?
Or the name that I brought to him?
Man a nigga put a fling, put a torch to ‘em
And I put that on my son, I tried to talk to ‘em
And tell ‘em stay away from murder
R.I.P to my Lil nigga Snupe
Yeah that’s how we rockin’, we rockin’ our Lil Snupe for life nigga
You know how we doin’ it
I said, I said they even killed my homies, they murdered Lil’ Snupe
He was only 18, only one that was a coupe
If you get a job they laugh at you, kill something they salute
That’s the only shit they see, that’s the only shit they do murder
Black clouds, black people, black roses
Young mothers teaching daughters how to bust it open
Babies having babies and them babies having babies man
This shit is lookin’ crazy even birthday was a maybe
Mommy playing daddy role, ‘cause he behind a fence
And she told them he in school ‘cause them kids they in suspense
Man these clouds look grey from this view behind the tent
Good girls that selling pussy, she was due behind the rent
And these kids need shelter, don’t nobody help her
And who am I to judge her, tears of a single mother
And the only thing that scare her, ain’t nobody hear her
So them tears turn black when the touch the mascara
Why I treat my last meal like I treat my last prayer
Very thankful, ‘cause I done had shackles on my ankles
Shackles on my wrist too, I swear that shit was painful
The reflection of your eyes through that picture
I could paint you, like Basquiat, feel a soul from the fascia
Some recite the songs, the religious say the fire hot
And I don’t want to go to hell, but it’s hell on Earth
If I can't pay God with this money, then tell me what it’s worth

[Talking: Meek] Let me get down to these bitches..UHN!

[Rapping: Meek, Verse 6]
I say, I say, Said she want a boss just to sweep her off her feet
Hit her with the D and I can’t keep her off the meat
Keep her off of me and we don’t get to hardly speakin’
We be creepin’ all in weekends, I’m talkin’ freakin’ all in weeks
But I know you still think about when i fucked you
And when I came through with your best friend, crushed you
All white [?] no tint, know I touched you
Tried to give my man some, he ain’t wanna bust you
‘Cause loyalty is royalty, hoes ain’t loyal
You are what you are and I had love for you
Heard you with a baller, hopin’ he enjoy you
Hopin’ he like buying  Louis Vuitton just to spoil you
‘Cause you was like a bill with a drill to my pocket
All these hundred dollar bills in my pocket
I could build my own bad bitch ‘cause i got it
Let you meet my new girl she looks like a Goddess
She could give you gottens and she gon’ give you problems
When she don’t even try to, blame it on your momma, bitch
Or blame it on jail, ‘cause you thought you was poppin'
With your little followers (ha)
She thought she was poppin’ with her little bit of followers, ha
I said my girl fuck a nigga with some money
What I do? Tell her break ‘em, And if a nigga fuck my bitch for free
What I do? Let ‘em take her (You can have that bitch)
‘Cause I got so much money, What I do? I could build ‘em, I could make ‘em
Tummy tucks and ass shots, what we doin’? Flying bitches to Jamaica
Dreamchaser, nigga!
Talk to ‘em!

[Talking: Omelly]
Real niggas back in style man, Guns and butter man, D.C
[Rapping: Omelly]
Uh, Uh, It’s Osama, Twin Llama, from the D.C. camp
Heard you like to run your mouth, you the people’s champ?
All that shit gon’ get your t-shirt damp
A tag on your toe, pussy nigga that’s the D.C. stamp
Carry two’s, with my jewels, you niggas thinkin’ jackpot
Well walk up on me, you gon’ hear that Mac pop (blap!)
(With the ladder in the stashbox) (oh)
(Black Talon that’ll knock down a Sasquatch)

[Rapping: Meek, Verse 7]
Let me talk to these bitches, I said

And you are who you are, who you not here
Breaking news, shit I think we got a thot here

Talkin’  ‘bout Greystone she be like "I’m there"
Live on Sunday, Tiny and T.I. there (laughing)
I said, I said, Velvet on Sunday (unintelligible)
I said, what I said? I said ATL Saturday tweeting at T.I there

Seen a flyer on Instagram that LeBron there
He ain’t even show up, she ain’t make her mind there
Stevie J on the mic, Meek Milly P my here
That ain’t in the building got Omelly, Coon and Tak here
Now you in my VIP, bitch how you got here?
I took a G-5 here, you had a buddy pass that’s not fair
How the fuck you beat me here? I seen you in Atlanta
I went to Live, you got there ‘fore me and we came in a motherfuckin’ G-5 bitch
(She had a buddy pass, how she get here?)[Hook]
2Pac back, 2Pac back
There’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back

They screaming 2Pac back, 2Pac back
There’s all these btiches screaming that 2Pac back

[Meek Mill]
Huh, 2Pac back, I’m 2 Glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly this the new Iraq
Soon as I hit the the hood they screaming who got wacked
It’s a recession on the work, I’m screaming who got crack
I’m sippin Hennessy, riding on my muthafucking enemies
Sliding in the back screamin MMG (Maybach Music)
10 bitches and they dime so it’s Tennessee
Hail Mary, put my wrist on froze
Presidential is gold, nigga play with my money my shooters lifting his soul
40 kick like in soccer, bullets hitting the goal
Bitch I’m like John Wall cause I just give em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold em
Look at them muthaf-ckin’ wheels, them bitches is stolen
They screamin’…

[Hook]

[Meek Mill]
Mommy a soldier, daddy is dead
Catch the nigga that did it, and we gon’ carry his head
Fuck 911, tell em have him in?
Talking Death Row records, tell em have me a chair
Let it burn, I’m screaming: "Free my nigga Earl!"
He’s due in, no hestitation we can’t even get a turn
And my Mackaveli CD then I listened than I learned
Grabbed my Mac above the dresser, my OG’s say hold it firm
I’m dreaming spitting with Pac, cyphers with BIG
Try to send me upstate with the license ?
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like there’sa price on my head
I going max, got me knocking suckers and they back
In these cells, raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don’t ever get it twisted it’s Meek Mill spittin’ facts
Plus somebody said they seen it
And they mean it so they steady screamingThey know who I am, they know who I be
If it ain't about money, then it ain't about me

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I know you see it go around, money full circle
Blunt in full circle, smoking on that colour purple
On the beat I go silly, real ugly motherfucker
Bitches love that I'm a rapper but she know I ain't a sucker

Everybody double take now I'm late on set
Got a pocket full of green, faces like Gumbee
'Bout to take another round call it 720
Headed to the club going close in an hour
One on one on, East bound and down Kenny Powers
I just took off face look sour, I can here 'em screaming my name like Alvin

Going way past 60
Girl I think you just missed me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yo I say what goes around comes around, 360
When it comes to bad bitches I keep three with me
One to fuck me good, one to suck me good
One to ride hard, hold the work tuck it good
Only thing I wish, I wish a motherfucker would
I'm living life and getting money like I fucking should
I'm on another level, that make you understood
Oh you ain't understanding, nigga I am making good
360, we make 'em 360
Popcorn looking like a box of rice crispy

Cause I'm gonna keep shining on these haters 'til they hit me
100 thousand dollars cash, $20 bills bitch, I be on that real shit

Right back to the hood with my goons tryna kill shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I said bitch I'm the bomb, everything hunneds
'Bout to take another round call it 9-hunned
Call me when you sitting home alone like Mc Culkin
'Bout to leave the club but I don't know where the fuck the sun is
See me speeding through the city like we racing in a summit

Why you think yo girl ain't call since the last date?
Huh, I'm gone, backspace

Don't even bring a stretcher for him, bring a bed
They ain't even touch his body
I paint the pavement wit your blood﻿, blue purple, burgundy red
The nigga's talkin' reckless, they scared
All 'em south gangsta's, they cowards, and call the fed's
How ya'll niggas gonna go against me, the whole north-side know that I'm G
Respect that, and I'mma rep that 'til I D-I-E
To get a pass, you gon' need a ID, to come through
Pussy nigga lookin' sideways like he don't like me

Nigga shootin' from a block away, and don't incite me
If they wasn't through me, jus' tell 'em come walk up to me

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: NH]

Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all types of designers

If I ain't have my rap deal, then I still be serving bricks

My gold Role cost 60 racks, my rose gold cost 40

[Hook]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Cuz I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips, and I rock A1 clothes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Pray to God, I washed my hand but I be damned
2012, 100 racks to Uncle Sam
A 24 year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit, park my car bowlegged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jerome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your ho be cropping the image
I let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish it
Then come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up
Then more ca-ca-ca-ca, til I know I gotcha
Ballin like I'm baldin', then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga that's flawless VVS, CC text me what you wearing
Puttin my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips thats power steering
About to hydroplane when I board that plane and land inside the building

[Hook][Chorus: Mike Davis]

And all my niggas know we 'bout them dollars, about them dollars, know we 'bout them dollars
And I just went and count a hundred thousand, a hundred thousand, count a hundred thousand
Spend that up and keep that money pilin', and keep it pilin', keep that money pilin'
And all my hoes just know I run the island, run the island, know I run the island

[Verse 1: Mike Davis]

Niggas mad cause that money long
I just count it, like a hundred long
Eight months, two hundred songs
Now a nigga get money for it
Paid up, and I'm laid up, with your main bitch, and I paid her
She flex on me, I flex on her, I'm Floyd May' with that paper
I'm Floyd May' with that paper
I meet your bitch then I take her
That's word to Mami I'm going crazy
My new music this shit wavy
Thirty thou' for that verse, maybe
40k for that show, pay me
I be riding 'round so crazy
I been riding 'round with your ho lately
I'm going H.A.M. with them doors up
In the crib she taking those clothes off
Staring at her like "Oh Lord"
Knock it down while I'm on tour
Activist and that dour smoke
Got me highed up, I might doze off
Activist and my cup full
I don't share drink, I just pour more, I just pour more

[Bridge: Mike Davis]

And I just dropped your bitch cause she was wilin'
And I'm just gonna keep that money pilin'
Keep that 30 in the cut just for the violence
Them 38s they with my goons they got the silence

[Chorus]


[Bridge: Keke Palmer]

Cut your nigga off cause he was wilin', wilin', keep that money pilin'
You said you was gon' take me to an island, why is you lyin', baby just be honest
I know he just wanna get behind it, he wanna drive it, cause I got better mileage
Got that Saint Laurent Balenciaga, I got them dollars, don't need you to buy it

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]

Niggas mad cause my paper straight
Been the one since like '88
And I was born in '87, put my niggas on and they crazy straight
When you shinin' hard, they throw shade your way
Fuck me good, and get a rate today
I can tell that pussy wet
'Fore I eat the box let me say my Grace, like Amen
Nigga Amen, Amen, all you gotta do is say when
Said I came when
Quarter mil' when I came in
Odds on the wheel when I came in
Took a plane in
None of y'all niggas ain't been
With a bad bitch and they friend
On a G5, with your mind blowing in the wind
Hit rewind and we doing it again
With them drinks I'ma (Pour more)

[Bridge + Chorus][Intro]
Yeah, turn the lights on
Yeah, turn the lights on
Yeah, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on

[Hook: Rico Love]
These hoes be acting up
These hoes be acting up
These hoes be acting up
And these niggas be letting 'em
These niggas be letting 'em
These niggas be letting 'em
These niggas be letting 'em
And me, I don't be sweating 'em

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
These hoes be acting up
And these niggas be letting 'em
I crushed them hoes, I never love them hoes
And these niggas be sweating 'em
Cause I run shit like Edgerrin
Or better yet, like Rev and them
And on the bottom of my sneaks they red, man
And I ain't talking 'bout no damn Meth and them
Stay Louboutin and I super grind
VS stones, they super shine
I pop the Perc, I get super high
And I drill your bitch, root canal
I rock Tom Ford, Concords
And I shine on these dime whores
This bitch done bought me a Rolex
And I still ain't got no time for her
These hoes be acting up
These niggas be acting tough
I'm in the Phantom, I'm backing up
And I'm bust down, but I'm strapped as fuck
So hold your horses, Polo horses
Aston Martin, we roll in Royces
Real niggas up in the building
Them hoes choose us, ain't no more choices

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
These hoes be acting up
See, me, I don't practice much
Gold albums from the word of mouth
Gold bottles in the back of us
These Jones be broke as fuck
Too uptight, they won't open up
She got her arms folded even on the phone
I'm like, what the fuck is she here fo?
These hoes be acting up
These niggas keep wifing up
Please homie, got me cracking up
Never spent one more than a night with her
These hoes be a fucking joke
They'll never say a nigga didn't warn you though
Cause you can hit my phone like four in the morning
And I be like, hah, told you so

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
These hoes be acting up
Big bread we racking up
Straight to the bank, cee-lo
Cancel that bitch like Nino
Ratchet ass ho, don't play with me
Want to Kobe me, want to Humphrey me
Want to Michael me, Russell me
Take me to the bank and Tiger me
Now these hoes be acting up
These clothes ten stacks and up
These cars 100 racks and up
These drums 100 rounds and up
Bitch, blow me like a trumpet
Twenty thousand, all in hundreds
Fuck it, money, money, money
Money, money, money, ah!

[Hook][Intro]
I had that little bad bitch with me the other night
She gon ask me why I don't ever go to sleep cause I was up
You know what I told that ho

[Bridge]
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
Bitches know its money when we step up in the building
Neck is saying cool but my wrist is saying chillin'
Stuntin' so hard I could hurt a hater feeling

[Verse 1]
Grind hard then you shine hard that's the motto
Shitting on these niggas like I fucking hit the lotto
Who you know fresh from out the hood to a Gallardo
House up on the hill stupid crazy dumb retardo
Y'all know, either going home or going hard doe
You only live once and I'm a ball until I fall ho
[?] all that hatting shit ain't even called for
We just pull up on you haters looking like a car show
Made a hundred grand and I blew it
Made another hundred grand and I ran through it
Every time I get it spend it like its nothing to it
If I see it and I like I'm like Nike I just do it
I just cop it I just drop it [?]
Gucci Louis Polo [?]
Breitling Rollie Audemar
Fuck it I want all of it
Kobe though I'm balling bitch
Competition calling quick
Addicted to the money I guess I'm a cake-a-holic then

[Bridge]

[Hook]
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (you heard me ho)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (what did you tell that ho?)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich
All them bitches know its money when we step up in this bitch

[Verse 2]
They say ain't nothing coming to a sleeper but a dream
And I ain't been to sleep since I was fucking seveteen
Money that you've never seen
Graveyard shifting it
Late night getting it
All about the Benjamins
Break the work down let the Pyrex heat up
Hit my youngins off to count the money with my feet up
Let them sleep we up, hating nigga D up
Hustlers hear this shit then bring it back like its the re-up
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
They talking about no homicide I say that I'm a kill them
Talking about that blow paper money to the ceiling
Bitch I'm about my mula give a fuck about your feelings
Chill then, ain't no time for cuddling and kissing
Just hustling and [?]
You tired just like Michelin
I be up like all night counting my percentages
Trapping all day and serving fiends like this was tennis here

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich like porter
Stared with a dollar turned that to four quarters
I hustle like I got three sons and four daughters
Watching for the D's dipping in the Ford Taurus
I'm porridge, flaming hot
You hating if you say I'm not
I buy that shit you say you got
I hustle I don't play a lot
Dawg I let my swagger do the talking I don't say a lot
Hustle and make it five times back I never save a lot

[Bridge + Hook]

[Outro]
Word up
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich nigga
How do some of you niggas go to sleep dead broke
I don't understand them
Cause I ain't going to sleep until my bank account on muhfucking seven,eight digits nigga
You already know
Meek Milly Flamerz[Intro: Meek Mill]
Ain't I ain't I ain't I
Ain't I ain't I ain't I

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Drama be the DJ
I just spit that shit and he gon' bring it back like replay
I come from the east side, run shit like a relay
Bunch of Philly killers with me they all look like Freeway
I know what we do is wrong
You can catch me in the hood probably somewhere don't belong
I keep with my tre pound long
And Omelly keep his glit
His clip hold like 33 that's three circles from a brick
On some shit, that's your bitch
No it ain't cause she ours
Pull up to the club we be on Banshees and CRs
Ask about us who we are
I'm a young king [?]
I ain't asking for no ride I made it here all by myself
Come for the belt ya for the ring
Ask your ho I do my thing
I was locked up in the [?] but still I shine like I was bling
On the block with that Yao Ming
Trying to move that China white
Ya I grind like I ain't even about to blow like dynamite
I'm that [?] just call me Mike
I change hoes just like they're clothes
I change O's just like they're floors
And keep my money for them hoes
I keep money on re-load
I keep cash up in this stack
I don't even know these lames but yet they [?]
And I just laugh

Bitch I'm trying to fuck you, you keep worrying about TI
Haters they can see I'm all about my BI
Bitch I been on swag [?]

[Verse 2: Nitty]
Ain't I on my job
Lotta niggas hate cause we be moving like the mob
My boys in all black
Nigga run his mouth then then nigga lose his cap
West Philly back pocket that's where you find me at
State they got my nigga Dean
I be on promethazine
Show you how we walk them down
No time with them triple beams
I get a [?] break it down let my youngins grind
You see them tres of the meter, and they done with dime
You had your work all week shit I hustle mine
I hustle hard, hustle hard I ain't never fine
I just hit a lick, all white bricks
Fuck the drought we be flipping like a light switch
Ask my nigga [?] he got a [?]
We like a junkyard, we stay with metal shit
I can do it right or I can do it wrong
You buy it soft, try to cook it you be losing homes
[?] told me get them where I fit in
The mac look great but its gorgeous with the clip in
And when it start to ripping, niggas start to scraping
And dipping, hoping they don't catch it in their biscuit
West side of Philly nigga that be me
Disrespect and we check 'em like an ACG
They say your green not fire
Your white not oil
You niggas at loyal when you shining like foil[Intro: DJ Drama]
Alright lets be clear
They might of done a thing or two
But there track record in the streets is "Ain't Like Me"
They ain't me

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with
But this one bad bitch you can't see
And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD
And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with
Can't come round a nigga ain't see
And them bricks still sell them for the high
My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap
These niggas still sell the work
Tell 'em work ain't that easy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
These pussy ass niggas can't come to my hood
Cause you pussy ass niggas ain't me
I got all these shooters that's down for the cause
And they all get money like me
And, and I still ride around my hood
Quarter milli on a nigga white tee
And yall niggas still hating on it, still hating on it
Talking what they gonna do to me
But I'm strapped up & I'm waiting on it
These niggas ain't built like that
These niggas get killed like that
Running 'round my name in their mouth
Banana clips get peeled like that
And they wonder why I feel like that
Cause every other month I make a mill like that
Took my whole family up out that hood
Set 'em all nice in the hills like that, shit real like that
You ain't gotta like my shit, paid for the flow, I don't write my shit
Better pray to God I don't like your bitch
Cause if she catch eye then she might get hit! Woah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm a real ass nigga and I've been like that
Day one and I ain't gone change
In the hood nigga act a little different when I come through
Cause a nigga got a little change
Little pussy ass nigga don't test no nigga
Cause if he do then its gone be flames
That 40 gone go bang bang
Them niggas might say my name
My young niggas got rollies on
Bitches got them Birkins on
My trigger finger been itchin'
My patients short, but my money long
Its levels to this shit for real
Boy I'm dream chasing tryna see a hundred M's
Got the plug on deck if I wanna go back
Put work in the trap what you know about that
Pillow talking to ya ho hating on a nigga
Fuck around lose ya ho like that
Ain't me, ain't me, these rapping ass niggas, ain't me
Only fuck with real niggas like Meek (What up meek?)
You ain't CMG or DC

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Omelly]
Ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Gettin' money my day ones you know we reppin' DC
Cousin dropped that bag on you, I kill you niggas for free
I got all this money on me, I got all these hundreds on me ho
Backin' up in this Panamera with some rich ass hoes
Started off with a quarter ounce, had to get that dough
Flip them, move circles on them like Tic Tac Toe
Hoes ready they fucking sucking on the get set go

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ Drama]
I guess we can't tell you enough
What you do won't make you me
Truthfully some of you niggas need to get some sleep
Your dreams aren't manifesting correctly[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
She is from the west side shawty on her best side
Little bit of [?] with her [?]

Plus 5 plus 5 she was dead fine
Go to sleep all in it like nap time
She woke up like this, with her ass all on me from the backside
She wanted to the surf board just trying to be like Beyonce
And if she always do it this good then she might just be my finace

I think she in love with me cause that watch up on her say love o' clock
I want more I want more [?] out on tour
We go to Paris then go to the store
She was on paper it [?]
We fell in love and we was for sure

[Hook: Chris Brown]
[?] look what you started
[?] to another party
All I want is you all I want is you baby

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]

[Hook: Chris Brown]

[Bridge: Chris Brown]

[Hook: Chris Brown][Intro: Meek Mill]
Man, fuck all these niggas

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I used to have bad luck
Now you might see me in the land truck
Whole clique, full of real niggas that'll stand up
When you see them hammers out
Nigga put yo hands up
Matter fact put yo hands down nigga man up
Take this headshot, hit yo homie that's a and1
Shoot 'em, that's for rockin' out with shooters down til the van come
Feds tapped my I-Phone
Metro, and my Samsung
Block numbers callin' me and I don't know if to answer
Coke money comin' in, Rap money comin' too
I just bought a mulsanne
Shitted on them , number 2
Homie that's your boo-thang, my niggas we be runnin through
We pass her round like hot potato, Melly hit I fuck her too
Hammer dat, AK wit' a 50 I banana dat
Lifes got it's up and downs sorta like a camel back
If it's beef, I don't say a word my niggas handle that
Put 50 on Miami it won't even turn the channel back
Woah nigga, Die slow nigga
You got booked with 10 birds and you home nigga
I think you told nigga, you get exposed nigga
I easy pass up in yo bitch you paid a toll nigga
I drop, back on that paper ain't got no racks for these haters
My niggas trap in the field, silver and black like the raiders
This hatin' shit like a virus, niggas be catchin' them vapors
I spend a mil on my crib, barely be catchin' my neighbors
Cause I don't never be there, Northside i'm heavily there
Prolly be up in the hills, wit a bitch named Beverly there
I had a dream I got murdered I think the devil was there
Then woke up fingers on triggers [?]

[Verse 2: Spade-O]
You think of me, you think of a problem
Who, what, where, and how the fuck yo family gone pay for yo coffin
Hey main man we way pass the friend stage
Nigga left engaged, I hit you in yo face with a ten gauge
I'm from where it is, Nigga you from where the cash was
I bust a nigga head, And make him show me where the cash was
After us there should be no more
If it was so much love it would be no war
If they all were good girls, There would be no whores
And how much fun would that be, They're all gunnin at me
And no false alarms, So when I call to arms
All my niggas get wound tight like big balls of yarn
It's on, Drastic timing, Drastic living
I mean I feel an itch, I make rash decisions
I'm a street mathematician, I blew from a 62
You wouldn't believe the type things that white shit will do
From acer with the gap in his teeth
Ace of spade half a mill worth of crap on the streets
Started rappin' on beats, and pushin' rhymes like weight
Homie go and get yours, I got mines I'm straight
Spent most of my teenage years on a crate
5 dollars at a time in pursuit of Bill Gates
Wait, I'm a nigga you gotta see tho
I'm sum'n like a mix between Debo and Tim Tebow
My steelo I bogard like Humphry
The rims on the Benz make that bitch look Comfy
Chump me, I dare a nigga try and pump me
The 4 pound a ground any niggas tryna jump me
Get goofy my trigger finger get loosey
Goosey shit I got blood on my gucci's
Oh well I go and get a new pair
This ain't the same ole shit
This is sum'n new here
Yeah it's no fear, Cause when I was serving time
They was rappin' bout sellin' bricks, and they were servin' dimes
It's fine, I move better in the dark
So when a nickel bag get sold in the park
Nigga I want in, 8's and 9's like I won him
But if them hoes ain't dimes shit I don't want them
I'm like a gem or like a diamond in the rough
The audemar is pristine no diamonds in the cuff



[Outro][Intro]
To the pimpin' and that's where I'm gonna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay, and I say

Cuz a nigga like you
Keep on fake shoes, you look like fool for a nigga like who?
Nigga like me

Niggas don't act like niggas like me
Niggas don't move like niggas like me
Bitches be like "that nigga ain't street"
That nigga ain't real, that nigga ain't right
That nigga don't bang, he ain't part of that life
That nigga ain't rich, that nigga been lyin'
That nigga ain't fly, that nigga ain't live

See, the difference is I'm a different nigga
You same lame around different killas
You came with her, I left with her
I'm up in her, you textin' her
You paid for it, I pass on it
Speed up, I gas on it
Drunk drive, I crash on it
Fly out, I passport it
All these hoes
Fuck with a nigga like me
Cuz a nigga like me, just really might be
The last real nigga they see
See!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Nigga like me, true OG
Nigga like you, certified lame
You can rich, bricks are a payday bitch
And I swear ain't shit gonna change, nigga
I be in the hood where the gangstas be
You a pussy nigga, you supposed to bleed
Type of niggas say we beefin' but you pressin' charges
Type of nigga gotta plug but [?]
I can see you in the club talkin' loud arguments
I'm the type don't say a word, I just start sparkin'
Bang! Bang! Bang, bang!

Real niggas, this the lifestyle
I should get her digits, get her iced out

[Hook]
