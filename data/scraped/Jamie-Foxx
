[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you

[Post-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]

Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
You put it on me baby
Not just the physical
You mentally stimulate me
I'm really in love that's crazy
Girl you can't even save me
You got me thinkin' 'bout us havin' us some babies
Everything about love got me like
Baby come home and put it on me tonight

Fuck them other girls, they ain't you
You're the only one I need and that's the truth, oh baby

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you

Cause you changed me baby

[Interlude: Jamie Foxx]
Girl it ain't just me
Tell 'em how you feel Breezy

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You know what I'm missin', fiendin' for your kisses
All night on my phone, when you talk I listen
Sexin' all in the kitchen
Breakin' all of these dishes
Your crib or my bed, it don't make a difference
I'm lickin' on your body girl I'm feelin' on your booty
Now you really wanna do the nasty
Girl I love it when you get on your knees you make me disappear like magic
Girl you don't even know
All the bitches I let go, for you

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down
Cause you changed me baby

[Post-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Said I'd never settled down
I'm with you girl, look at me now

You switched that up in one night, oh baby
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
You know I've been all over the world, man
I had really gave up on this shit, you know
Finally met a girl that do for me though
It's crazy, it's like a dream
I think I got me one[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]

[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
She take my money, when I'm in need
Yeah she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger, way over town
That digs on me

[Hook]
(She give me money) Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down

[Verse 1]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm and your arm
But I'm looking for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz?
Ok, get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
18 years, 18 years
She got one of your kids, got you for 18 years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
She walking around looking like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk, holla, "We want prenup!"
"We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass she gonna leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I ain't saying you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washing watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes balling and yeah that's nice
And they gonna keep calling and trying but you stay right girl
And when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl

Lemme hear that back[Produced by Kanye West]

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
(Are you going to be, say that you're gonna be)
She said she want some Marvin Gaye
Some Luther Vandross
A little Anita
Will definitely set this party off right
She said she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yes it will
It definitely will!
You know what I told her?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told her to "drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring the Cool Whip
Then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick
So we get our grind on"
She be grabbing
Calling me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine, homes
Why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds
When she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World
She was ready for some action
My dogg said you ain't a freak
So you gotta prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get right

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the gliss' on my hands and wrists
While I'm laying back, smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
From the Chi, and I be
Sipping Hennessy, play some R&B
Try and smoke a B, looking properly
Feeling on a G? And always (Well Well Well Well Well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, get into some Isley's
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little Spinners
While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (well well, well well)
Put my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl?
Come on over, make me touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
An every moment you controlling me I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back to the melody of "Roll It Slow"
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug, you see
I still spit it like its R&B, go to the club with me
And with some Luther come on, I hope you feelin' me and still gon' be in love with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers, need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that, then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone, got to get you home
Gotta run up on, and I do it
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers, need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that, then I
Take you to my home
We can get it on
Disconnect the phone
Trying to get you boned
I'mma make you moan[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
I really need to see you babe, tell me when you're on your way
I roll one up for you babe, pour one up for you babe
I've really been missing your body, sex so good like "Oh my God"
I know you like it when you on top, do it babe, do it, don't stop
Baby send a text or a call, hit a nigga when you get off
Girl I know you want that raw, girl I know you want that
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Cause she ain't got me feeling like a star, I'mma meet you right where you are

[Hook]
Feels good when we smoking, fucking, kissing, licking, stroking, touching
Feels good when we cum together, rainy days are perfect weather
Girl you get wetter than a storm, dream get you in real form
We hit it like we 'bout to shoot a porn, uh
Yeah, and I'm gon' beat it like a drum, beat it like a drum
Beat it, bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom bom
Bom, bom bom bom bom

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Girl I've been waiting on you, when you gon' come come come come?
Beat, beat 'til your legs get weak, and your shit cum, numb numb numb numb
Girl I'm in the mood for some cake, it ain't even my birthday
I'mma still put it in my face, ooh I just love that taste

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Recently thinking 'bout you a little more
Thinking teching your temperature with a, a call
Far too long, you probably involved, press ignore
This the type of thoughts for hours after the liquor store
Chemistry, let me into your energy
I'm German with every 100% of me
And I find us a rhythm making you quiver
It's so different I'm into your symbol like instrumental beats
Fall back, fall, I'mma leave for that son and go back
Fall back, fall, when I leave I need drum roll, please
And applaud when I depart, break you off any song playing these com
But be cautious, I beat the breaks off you, no days off, everyday Team Barker

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jamie Foxx]
If you want it, you can get it, you got keys to my address
Put your keys in your ignition, get here soon as you can get it
Get a nigga up and it's gon' go down, get you so wet then a nigga might drown
Matter fact, thinking 'bout it got me going crazy, baby where you at, where you at right now?
Hurry up girl come pull out the stick, all this D that you 'bout to get
Feels so good, yeah feels so good, once I get in can't pull out the bed
Bom bom bom, just like a drum, no I ain't done, got me shooting like gun
I want it all the time, girl it ain't a hit and run, every time we do it you be feeling like the one

[Hook][Hook]
I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now
It's been so long for me, I don't know how, by now
Been drowning in the sea of broken vows, by now
But I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now

[Bridge]
I've been chasing my dream, now I'm chasing you
Running hard but my legs feel weak
I done played every part, I done played a fool
Write the movie, I'll be your lead

[Verse 1]
Cause I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now
Well girl you stole my heart now take a bow, by now
In love by now
Well I'm supposed to walk you down the aisle, by now
Change your name and make your parents smile, by now
Leave the Church, make plans to celebrate, by now
A big old house and babies on the way, by now

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Well I'm supposed to be in love today, by now
Go through my phone and throw 'em all away, by now
In love by now
Without your love, I want what they say when they write my stories
Without your touch, I'll never know how it feels to fly
Drown in my emotions, now it's all on me
Eyes are finally open to love I couldn't see
Can't wait 'til I can say bless the day you landed in my arms

[Outro]
I'm supposed to be in love by now
I'm supposed to be in love by now
In love by now[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
Kanye, it's Foxx, man
I'm just sayin' I was talkin' to the girls you know
And we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometime
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club you know
She gotta drink water cause she thirsty
She danced like ninety-two hundred songs back to back
With ain't nobody really try to find out what she feelin'
Like how she feel... you know what she told me?

Say that you're gonna be (Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooooo)

[Hook: Jamie Foxx (Luther)]

She said she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right

Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers?

[Aisha Tyler]
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
Can you please - do it faster, do it faster

[Kanye West]
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin the rhythm like Marvin and Luther

In the Chi and I be sippin Hennessey - play some R&B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)

Bumpin R&B - and I got the heat - on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)

Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze

You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me

And every moment controlling me

And still will be in love wit me

[Hook - Jamie Foxx]

Bridge 2: Jamie Foxx ad-libs (w/ female singer)

[Hook - Jamie Foxx][Intermission: Jamie Foxx]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down
And get closer to you

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Get a little closer to me too
You get a little shy when we start to move
Get a little high when I'm tryna decide if it's London or China too
Forget about the plans that you got later
I kiss you like you can't have too many
The Earth is like round and round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know
So in the meantime I'm here and I'm gone in love
Because you chose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

[Intermission x2]

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It's Kid Ink, uh
So come and walk my way
Roll up, I can spark that flame
There's something about the way you make that face
Girl is you talkin' to me, whoa?
Let's start with the drink, pour up
Get you and your friends toe up
Don't sip slow on the low though
Wait, tell me what you here for
I could read the signal, girl, you bad, sinful
Body just like a centerfold
But you probably got a nigga though
If anybody ask, I don't know him
Couldn't just let you pass me and ignore it
Doin' all that cute shit
Took a couple shots and got shot by Cupid

[Hook x4][Intro]
"Oooh, now you are one lucky nigger."
"You better listen to your boss white boy."
"Oh, I'm gonna walk in the moonlight with you."
"You wanna hold my hand?"

[Hook]
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves, so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles, while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)
Black coffins! (I need a hundred...)

[Verse 1]
I seen a hundred niggas die
I put that on my life, Lord, I wouldn't tell a lie
Unless it had to do with mine, in the middle of the night
Killers coming for you life, all you wanna do is shine?
I broke off the chains only the realest remain
I see your praying to Jesus, but will that help ease the pain?
Seen a brother get slain for a jar full of change
Yet I post on the block, look like I'm Big Daddy Cane
Is you a cat or a mouse? Keep them rats out the house
A lotta scars on my back, get tattoes all around
Hundred dead bitches, hundred black coffins
Money on his head, bitch, I'm trying to make a fortune

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I seen a hundred women burn
As they stood firm, treat a nigga like a germ
What did she do to deserve? Put me on the farm
Pigs' feet in a jar; serve it to me warm
Any questions, they hang 'em, better pray for Dj-Django
Got me working in fields, too many years it gets fatal
All I want is my woman, such a wonderful mother, (mama!)
On the days that it rains, her smile bright like a summer
Our revenge is the sweetest, bitch cause I'm coming
Gonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother (my mama!)
Hundred dead bitches, (Lord) hundred black coffins (why?)
12 gauge, shotgun, chest full of carbon (boom-boom)

[Hook][Verse 1]
Girl you're my delight, 100% no feeling
Damn I gotta thank my plug, your love equals drug, and I got it bad now
Girl it I'm missing, I'm different when you're missing
By myself on rainy days, only you could save the day, girl I need your help now

[Pre-Hook]
All I know is that when I'm with you
One kiss, one kiss, one kiss, woo, and I'm gone than a mo'fucker
Your lips, your lips, your lips, woo, got me stormed than a mo'fucker
'Bout to take it to the head now, I, baby

[Hook]
I think I need another dose, I feel like I'm coming down
Girl you know your love is dope, I'm feining and I need it now
I think I need another dose, I feel like I'm coming down
Girl you know your love is dope, I need it and I need it now

[Verse 2]
Imagine waking up and you gotta have it
I'm talking morning, night and noon
Imagine feeling like an addict
Just one hit from you

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge]
We had an agreement, girl you know I need it, tryna end have your love
Girl you got me so high, baby that ain't no lie, don't think I ever, every get enough
We had an agreement, girl you know I need it, tryna end have your love
Girl you got me so high, baby that ain't no lie, don't think I ever, every get enough

[Hook]

[Outro]
Feeling like I'm coming down, I'm coming down, yeah[Verse 1: Guru]
Though the times are getting wicked I'm bolder
I got a chip on my shoulder
True players always maintain, I'm different I told ya
Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me
Fans now mobbing me
Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery
Back then I guess it was hard to see
The real paradox
What an odyssey
It's like that saying
Be careful what you pray for you might get it
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far would one let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next
Haters try to stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed
What's next hounded by the press
Mad stress on my chest
Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test
On "Any Given Sunday" I got to play my best

[Hook]
Sacrifice don't give up the fight
Everything will be all right on any given Sunday
Guru: The harder they come, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose
You know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
Guru: Strive to achieve and die for what you believe

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
On the battlefields left abandoned
One man standing
To me the ball was handed
Taken shots and left stranded
No defense so they tackle me
Every blow brings back a memory
Learning lessons from my injury
It's killing me
Cause at first they wasn't feeling me
Never given a chance to show my true ability
Too many pressures trying to play me out
Put me in positions that's sure to lay me out
No doubt

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
Playing on a field of hard times
These struggles like the yard line that I gain from
Nowhere is where I came from
From day one, I knew the game and how to play run
But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons
Now I learn from self when pain comes
And walk when they say run
Fame could be as painful as the Death of Payton
Young black, gifted
But I'm wrapped in myself
Done broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself
See what happens with wealth
At times you can lose yourself
During the sunniest of days many superstars melt
From cotton to football fields
You know how they play brothers
Long as we playing well they love us
I know on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
What it all comes down to is money
I know on Any Given Sunday
This could be taken from me
What it all comes down to is money y'all

[Hook x2][Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl
But I'm just tryin' to get my money right
So unless I'm done we could take a flight
So I can take you all around the world
Planes, trains, automobiles
Bentley or a Range, chromed out wheels
First class ticket, can afford you the deal, for real
I can take you all around the world

[Verse 1: Game]
She likes black Bentley coupes, black Daytons
Black interior, black ridin' shotgun
Black .45, black Air 1's
Bangin' the Black Album, track number one
She like that Jay shit, that's her favorite
If it's gon' get me the pussy, I'mma play that shit
If she bite too hard I'mma say that shit
But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit
Marcus Houston, I don't play that shit
By the time we got half way through watching Ray, I hit
I laid her down, beat it up, let her go clean it up
Take a five minute nap, then wake up and eat it, what
Then it's part two in the sauna
Feel like I'm fuckin' May J. cause she don't want no drama
I'd rather take your ass to the Bahamas
Than give you thirty thousand a month like Diddy, baby momma

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]

[Verse 2: Game]
Picture me thuggin', picture me lovin'
You like Bobbi love Whitney, now picture me fuckin'
Pullin' your ponytail, smackin' you on the ass
Telling you how I can take you all around the world
That nigga can't do it like this
Even Beyonce couldn't move it like this
She only fuck with soldiers, that's
Her shit
I hate to admit but I love my bitch
So much, I'm sittin' outside in the Benz
Thinkin' back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend
The pussy wasn't nothin'
Now I'm dealin' with the diary of a mad black woman with Louis Vuitton luggage
She told me she was tired of the Game and rap
Quit like Mase then she came right back
I told you the bitch sex was whack
And you're all I need, even Jamie know that

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]

[Verse 3: Game]
You know what they say, "more money, more problems, more drama"
Means more marijuana and less baby momma
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even white Air Force 1's come in two's
Yeah, I like her and I like you too
What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school
I gave you the Birkin bags so I made a mistake
And Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through
But I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid with you
Why we always gotta argue about Superhead's book
She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook
And when she start talking about buying a ring
I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing

[Hook: Jamie Foxx][Intermission: Jamie Foxx]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down
And get closer to you

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Get a little closer to me too
You get a little shy when we start to move
Get a little high when I'm tryna decide if it's London or China too
Forget about the plans that you got later
I kiss you like you can't have too many
The Earth is like round and round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know
So in the meantime I'm here and I'm gone in love
Because you chose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

[Intermission x2]

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It's Kid Ink, uh
So come and walk my way
Roll up, I can spark that flame
There's something about the way you make that face
Girl is you talkin' to me, whoa?
Let's start with the drink, pour up
Get you and your friends toe up
Don't sip slow on the low though
Wait, tell me what you here for
I could read the signal, girl, you bad, sinful
Body just like a centerfold
But you probably got a nigga though
If anybody ask, I don't know him
Couldn't just let you pass me and ignore it
Doin' all that cute shit
Took a couple shots and got shot by Cupid

[Hook x4]Hey {*4X*}

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
We gon' get it poppin now girl
Get your best dress on tonight
Once we start it ain't no stoppin girl
Get your best dress on tonight
This is for the girls
With all those ghetto curves
But we gon' get to poppin now girl
Get your best dress on tonight

[LL Cool J]
54-11's poppin wheelies front of Willyburgers
Candy apple M3's, slidin out gently
Rollin up in Bentleys, Tyson was the champ then
Right after the Rooftop, years before the Hamptons
You was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough
You was so beautiful and the world was so rough
Your man was locked up cause the cops popped up
You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up
He was yo' crush, you was his crutch
He'll be gone a dime and it's hard to stay in touch
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much
Now it's, broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust
Standin up on a crowded bus, for college courses
Stay on course when it gets rough, you never lost it
Stay strong baby trust, you'll be back flossin
Diamond studs and linen crush keep your head up

[Hook]

[LL Cool J]
Her boyfriend's comin through with them hickeys on his neck
He claims he's lovin her but never shows her no respect
All she knows is neglect, a lifetime of stress
Big momma, huh momma, now lil' momma is next
You can see the effects of gettin treated incorrect
Cause she let the cycle continue, make excuses for his steps
Her girlfriends tried to warn her, all he wanted wass the sex
Once he get it, then he gone, then it's on to somethin fresh
Somethin new, nuttin borrowed, nuttin blue, no weddin dress
But that's aight, you still young, you got your lifetime left
You gotta leave all that alone, find yourself
There's no love until you love you remind yourself

[Hook]

[LL Cool J]
To all my ghetto girls all around the world
You know the ones with the weaves and the Shirley Temple curls
Keep fightin, uhh
Baby girl keep fightin
To all my ghetto queens survivin by all means
There's a rock and a hard place you somewhere in between
Keep fightin, uhh
Baby girl keep fightin, yeah
To all my single mommas you been strugglin with drama
Doin what'chu gotta but still keepin your honor
Keep fightin, uhh
Baby girl keep fightin, yeah yeah, sing it

[Hook]

My buzz set in my buzz set in

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, catch me in a zone

Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Ooh see she spilled some drink on me
And now I'm knowin' she tipsy

And she keeps staring me right in my eyes
No tellin' what I'm gon' do
Baby I would rather show you
What you been missin' in your life
When I get inside

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Girl, I know you feel good, just like you look
Couple more shots, you open up like a book

I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty then you know
It's going down we can go kick it like Judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say I, I-I-I
Now she got her hand on my leg, got my seats all wet in my ride
All over my ride

Then my pants got bigga, she already knew what to figga
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck, that nigga"

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jamie Foxx]
Now to the ballas poppin' bottles
With they henny in they cups screamin'
Money ain't a thing if it ain't throwin' it up in the sky

If you lookin' like a model
When them broke fellas holla tell 'em bye
Hold your drinks up high

[Hook][Intro 1: Busta Rhymes]
Excuse me (Remix)
I think y'all need to bring a little bit
Of every type of liquor over here to the table, every bottle

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Mami lookin good, mami see me
And now she step into the bar because she know she need me
Her favorite song's on, body so appealing
And she sipping on me because she know she need the feeling
I make her feel good, she call me 'Tron silver
Gotta have me in her body, no matter if it kills her
I get up in her body, I'm kind of like a coach, boo
Mami feeling proper, body's moving like it's supposed to
(LOVE) When I'm in it I make mami wanna dance more (Yeah!)
Now she dancing like she's fucking on the dance floor
She moving like she wanna break 'em off
I keep her hot and sweaty till she wanna take it off
Baby girl you better sip slow
I'm dangerous when the bottle starts to get low
When shorty's knocked out from havin a ball
Just blame it on the al-al-al-al-alcohol

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Blame it on who? Blame it on me
She drink till she sleep when she drinkin' on me
I live in the cup, I watch the ice sink
She sippin' all night on some shit that's light pink
You know they say, you are what you drink
But baby I gotta be Louis The Thirteenth
And I could talk to her, but nobody hear
Her liquor so good she don't go around beer
Yeah! And shorty got class
Shorty got class when she pour me in the glass
Hey! Shorty take me to the head

[Hook: Jamie Foxx][Jamie Foxx - singing]
La la lahh, la la la la la la la lahh

[50 Cent - talking]
Yeah, uh huh, I like the way that feel

[Hook - 50 Cent]
I'll build you, but if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me, you'll be around
Hold me down, I'll build you up

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
Listen, if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine
It's the secret, I want the world to know that you're mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I'm writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon' play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon' stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I'm from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, that I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I'll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time, that's a secret (shhh...)

[Jamie Foxx - Hook]
Baby I build you up
Girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
Oooohhhooohhh yeah
I'd build you up
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure, right now
Girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
I'd build you up
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
I thinkin' 'bout you thinkin' that you feel the same way
Or is it just my imagination that get runnin' away?
If you ready to ride, girl, c'mon, let's roll
G-5-5 fly, ma, let's go
It's hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my presence
Your smile makes me smile, I'll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I'll pick out some shit
One pair at a time 'til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we'll be together probably
For better or worse, like Whitney & Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it's more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
Cause I know with you by my side there's nothing I can't do, yeah

[Jamie Foxx - Hook]
Baby, girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
I'd build you up
Oooohhhooohhh
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine
Build you up, baby, when you're down
Cuz your smile, like a frown, yes I will
I'm gon build you up baby
La la lahh, la la la la la la la lahh [repeat 8x][Ludacris]
Ha ha ha ha ha, yeah, ahhhh

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Sim-p-ly marvelous
(That's what you are, that's what you are, that's what you are)
More than outrageous (ooh ooh)
That's what you are
Beyond incredible, yeah yeah
(That's what you are, that's what you are, that's what you are)
Now that's contagious (ooh ooh)
Ooooh that's what you are (hey)

[Ludacris]
Luda! I must admit that you are truly somethin special
So hop up in my vessel, let's wrestle like I'm The Rock (Rock)
Deep in your ocean I'mma find your buried treasure
So hop up on the dresser, throw your legs up to the top (top)
Stretch it out like calisthenics
Bet it that Luda wet it and get it and have somebody call the medic (medic!)
My head is in the right direction
My quarter's in your jukebox, girl you are my #1 selection
I play you over and over, put your head on my shoulder
Slide down and give me head in the Rover (Rover)
And I'm a soldier, see it ain't no limits to the things we could do
And I made this record for you
So that we could break it down to the nitty-gritty one time
And when it comes to the sexin I get busy with mine
So you get busy with yours, I guess we destined to see
Baby girl, you are destined to be

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Yeah, uhh
Uh, so supernatural, wonderful and miraculous
You got me buggin off yo' attractiveness like WHOA (whoa)
So precise, so fine in yo' position
That my unanimous decision is to never say no (no)
You got me strung like a guitar
Playin the sweetest melody is definitely heavenly by far (far)
Further than the moon - and I never fake it
But I take it when you get naked cause your body's like BOOM! (boom!)
How could I resist it? I'll be there in an instant
When you call like tornadoes you got me twisted
I know you missed it, so I'mma give it good
You'll go ballistic, because I give it hood
Just like a nigga would, and like a nigga should
If you hear screamin then Luda's up yo' neighborhood
Good gracious, yeah I do it right
And all night, you are

[Hook]

[Jamie Foxx]
Yeah, it's courageous how you drop the phone and rush over
Crazy how you make me high when I'm sober
Just when I thought, I've seen it all
You put it down on meeeee
It's contagious how your lips make me lose composure
Addicted to the kisses, your blow got me swoll up
There's only one, my champion
That's what you are to meeee, yeah
Ooooooh yeah

[Hook] - 2X w/ ad libs[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Yes, let me talk to you
See when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give an idol up
And though I'm blessed, I still got to handle the things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to and vent your frustrations
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need them the most are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be having fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve them
Look at here, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell you
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view
And being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something I realize is that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walking with me going through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearing me out
But I thank you for just being there and for hearing me out
I got a clearer view
I thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you

[Hook: John Legend]
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm gon' to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
Everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
I made a decision

[Verse 3: Common]
I look in your eye and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life has changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catching planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of funds, trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you

[John Legend & Jamie Foxx]
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
I made a decision...[The Dream]
I wanna see what's under there baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Refrain]

[The Dream]
Baby, not a day goes by, whoa
Without you on my mind, whoa
Donna Karan underwear
Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about
Baby, I wanna see what's under there
It's easy, look lemme explain
Oh baby, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach third base
And when I get home I'mma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date
Ye, the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty-three year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress White, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby you up, question mark
And she respond, YES-S-S-I-R

[Refrain w/ ad-lib]

[Jamie Foxx]
I ain't lyin, no no

I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no[ Intro: The Dream]
Yeah, girl, you so sexy though
As she just lay at your feet

[ Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna see what's under there, there
Now put it in the air
Yeah, load it on my macbook air
It's a new form of macking, don't be old fashioned
Update your passion
Only reason why I be eye chattin'
Is when it's time for some action
I wanna hit it way, way out like John Paxton
But for now I just gotta watch her practice
Send her a picture so she see it
She says, I-I-I can't believe it
Ohh, she all on me, on me
Ohh, I think she want me, want me
I think she showed her homies
Why? Cause all the homies on me
Ayo, all the digital gonna have to do for now
But I'mma break it down when I get back in town

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes, oh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
I love you, girl, girl
You look right in the screen and take it off, off
See I can't wait till I get a little taste of you
And I just upgraded to 10-80i, hi def just for you

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
My homies never seen you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be

You shoot me a video and then I load
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Hook: Jamie Foxx and The Dream]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind, shawty
Hey, don't care what you wear
Baby, I wanna see what's under there

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
When you seen the picture cut off the face
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC search till I reach third base
And when I get home I'mma hit home plate
Wait, would this be considered our first date?
Yay, this picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And pose in the mag like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian and be a lady addict
You know what's a crazy thing?
A girl would make you wait longer than AC Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty three year old virgin
That's disrespectful, baby, don't encourage him
I like them brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my luck, I hit her with the text say

My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

"'Ye, the picture just looks so trash"
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash

You know what's a crazy thing?

That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian

And she respond, "YES-S-S-I-R"

As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run, by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID, BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called, The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the skin off ankles.

AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the Greenville Auction.

DJANGO
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance, he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts unknown, never to be seen again.

As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed for forty.

WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
structure.

The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front of the auction block.

DJANGO
is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on the block. A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

DJANGO
takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on the auction block. He looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to buy Niggers, who look up to him. His heart fills with poison.

BACK TO DJANGO
walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking - hating.

THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE end.

EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT

It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing their black skinned cargo forward.

It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the sky to create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek bed to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on their horse, as does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.

It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves, two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison, resemble a human locomotive.

The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white fur collars.

WHEN...
*A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their rifles for possible trouble.*

A BLACK HORSE
*carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.*

THE RIDER
*appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler hat on his head.*

DICKY SPECK: Who's that stumblin around in the dark? State your business, or prepare to get winged!

THE RIDER: Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.

*The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his face. He speaks with a slight German accent.*

THE RIDER: (to the Slaves) Good, cold evening gentlemen.(To the shivering Slavers)Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the'name of The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

ACE SPECK: Who wants to know?

THE RIDER: I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this is my horse, Fritz.

*Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
him.*

DICKY SPECK: You a doctor?

DR. SCHULTZ: Affirmative.

DICKY SPECK: What kinda doctor?

DR.SCHULTZ: Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you purchase those men at The Greenville Slave Auction?

ACE SPECK: So what?

DR.SCHULTZ: So, I wish to parley with you.

ACE SPECK: Speak English!

DR.SCHULTZ: Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a second language. Amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe, is a specimen I'm keen to acquire. (To the slaves) Hello you poor devils, is there one among you, who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?

*Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a-*

*VOICE rings out:*

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS): I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.

*Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
lantern, illuminating our hero Django.*

DR.SCHULTZ: Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

DJANGO: Django.

DR.SCHULTZ: Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm lookingfor. So tell me Django - by the way that's a amazing name - during your time at the Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know three overseers by the name of The Brittle Brothers?

*Django nods his head, yes.*
*Dr.Schultz is delighted.*

DR.SCHULTZ: Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

DJANGO: Dem da Brittle Brothers.

DR.SCHULTZ: So Django, do you think you could recognize The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their Slave in polite conversation...with a touch of disbelief.

ACE SPECK: Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!

DR.SCHULTZ: Like what?

ACE SPEC: Like THAT!

DR.SCHULTZ: My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

ACE SPECK: Speak English, goddamit!

DR.SCHULTZ: Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.

ACE SPECK: I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!

DR.SCHULTZ: Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for sale.

*Ace raises his rifle towards the German.*

ACE SPECK: Move it!

*Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.*

DR.SCHULTZ: My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture, or are you pointing that weapon at me with lethal intention...?

ACE SPECK: Last chance, fancy pants

DR.SCHULTZ: Very well -

*The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in darkness.*

*The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.*

*Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the German's direction...*

BAM...
*Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head... The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him... When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS... Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.*

*The Slaves watch all this.*

*They've never seen a white man kill another white man before. Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint. Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse, pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.*

DR.SCHULTZ: Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast. But I didn't want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses.

*Dr.Schultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands  overDicky's body.*

DICKY SPECK: You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!

DR.SCHULTZ: I only shot your brother, once he threatened
to shoot me. And I do believe I have:

*Counting out the slaves*

DR. SCHULTZ (CONT’D): …one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

DICKY SPECK: My damn legs busted!

DR.SCHULTZ: No doubt. Now, if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.
(TO DJANGO) As I was saying, if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, would you recognize them?

DJANGO: Yes.

DR.SCHULTZ: Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men look alike. So Django, in a crowd of unshaven white men, can you honestly and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

DJANGO, SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
*We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement. As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet white hands down her chocolate leg…they fondle his ass...they squeeze her tit…they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck faster…then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of Broomhilda…the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts, and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.*

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO: I can point 'em out.

DR.SCHULTZ: Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for Django?

DICKY SPECK: I'm gonna lose this leg!

DR.SCHULTZ: Yes, unless you find a talented physician very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the end result. But back to business, how much do you want for Django?

DICKY SPECK: You go to hell!

DR.SCHULTZ: Don't be silly. How much for Django?

DICKY SPECK: 800 dollars!

DR.SCHULTZ: Oh come now, I may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does, but neither was I born yesterday.

*The good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.*

DR.SCHULTZ: In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says that the going rate for African flesh' - in particularly a field nigger -is sixty to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as Django is, technically, a field nigger. Which according to this pamphlet here – and why would they lie - puts his price at eighty dollars. So in light of that, how about a hundred and twenty five dollars for young Django here?

*Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.*

Dr.SCHULTZ: And since your late brother won't be using it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.

*He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money in the saddle bags on Dicky's dead horse. With his hands in there, he roots around and finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.*

*Django is free.*

DR.SCHULTZ: There you go Django. Give your ankles a good rubbing, then get up on that horse. Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.

*Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.*

*Dr. Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.*

Dr.SCHULTZ: Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a bill of sale. Do you have one?

*Dicky just curses him.*

*He says, removing a notebook from his pocket:*

Dr.SCHULTZ: I thought not. No worries, I come prepared. (as he writes) This will serve nicely as a bill of sale. (he stops, then says to Django) Django is spelled with a silent "D", is it not?

DJANGO: Huh?

DR.SCHULTZ: Why not…

*He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
way it looks.*

DR.SCHULTZ: Yes, that does add a little character.

*The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.*

DR.SCHULTZ: If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make you mark here.

*The Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife. And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear. He signs the bill of sale.*

DR.SCHULTZ: Mr. Speck, I would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you, but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired.

*The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in leg irons.*

DR.SCHULTZ: Now as to you poor devils-
*He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.*

DR.SCHULTZ: So as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town. Which would be at least thirty-seven miles back the way you came. Or ... Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country. The choice is yours. He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;

DR.SCHULTZ: Oh, and on the off chance that there's any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.

*He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.*

DR.SCHULTZ: Just give him a little kick.

*Django does, and the horse responds by moving.*

DR.SCHULTZ:See, it's not so difficult[Verse 1 - Jamie Foxx]
Last night me and my dogs were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups and downs had me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember

[Hook]
Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

[Verse 2 - Jamie Foxx]
When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed and got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Everything that I remember

Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do girl
Cuz with all that recognition

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm and your arm
But I'm looking for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz?
Ok, get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
She walking around looking like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk, holla, "We want prenup!"
"We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass she gonna leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I ain't saying you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washing watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes balling and yeah that's nice
And they gonna keep calling and trying but you stay right girl
And when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl

Lemme hear that back
