[Intro: 50 Cent]
I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 745
You drive me crazy, shorty
I need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feeling me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?
Do you believe me when I tell you you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? Cause if so girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Hook]

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us[Produced by Darrell "Digga" Branch, Eminem & Luis Resto]

[Lloyd Banks]
Man we gotta go get somethin to eat man
I'm hungry as a motherfucker

[50 Cent]
Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long, son?

[Lloyd Banks]
50, calm down, here he come

[9 Shots]

[Lloyd Banks]
Ahh, ohh, what the fuck

[50 Cent]
Ah, son, pull off, pull off

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse 1]
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
I'm the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go'head lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Refrain]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse 2]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twisting trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doing life behind bars
I don't say only God can judge me cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pulling TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the Bible it says what goes around comes around
"Hommo" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing

[Refrain][Produced by Eminem]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
I owe you for this one

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinking I'mma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head like a baby born dead, destination heaven
Sit and politic with passengers from 9/11
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand writing lines knowing the Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Looking for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringing again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend

[Hook] x2

[Bridge: Eminem]
If you're patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table they operating to save you
It's like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit, basically they're just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray 'em 50
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this doc
Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothing spookier
You now about to witness the power of fucking 50

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
If the gun squad hearing all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
It's 50 - man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name
Niggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face
Have your ass running, mumbling to the jake
You going against me, dawg, you making a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave ya looking like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey
I'm down to sell records, but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94: ''we don't love them hoes''
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker

[Hook] x2[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mike Elizondo]

[Intro]
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shorty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
We gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nothing changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, nigga, roll the weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they saying "50, you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York the niggas'll tell you I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mill' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend willing to get bi and they ready to go

[Hook]

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You the faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire let the motherfucker burn
If you talking about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'mma tell you what Banks told me cuz go ahead, switch the style up
If niggas hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fucking be

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither
We in the club all the time, so pop, pop of
Shady Aftermath[Produced By: Cool & Dre]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out My Melody"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

[Hook]

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know "What's Going On" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma

[Hook][Produced by Mr.Porter]

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

[Verse 1]
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm bout my money you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimping know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

[Hook]
Yeah, in Hollywoood they say "there's no b'ness like show b'ness"
In the hood they say "there's no b'ness like ho b'ness", you know?
They say I talk a little fast, but if you listen a little faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch[Hook: Chief Keef]
Damn I hate being sober, I’m a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
We can’t spell sober
Ballout roll up, when we roll up bitches be on us
All the hoes they love smoking, and love drinking
Anti-sober, for no reason
Cause we can’t spell sober
Ya know us, we smoke strong bruh
Watch me roll up
Cause I can’t spell sober

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
On my tour bus we get dumb high you’s a floor boy
Fredo got a hangover he toting a Cobra
Last night he was shooting shit up like O-Dog
Reesy rollin, Tadoe got hoes on mollies
Chief Sosa, Ballout, we high riding ‘Raris
My bitches love drinking, some love smoking
Let my alcoholic bitch hit the dutch, she start choking
Call up D-Money, now we throw money
All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies
Call up D-Money, now we throw money
All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
We got 100 pounds of this shit, my stash house with them bricks
My pockets filled with them stacks, my bitch be gone off a flat
She a hot tamale when she pop a molly, it's time to party, we party hard
Drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, we high for sure
I came in back of that Rolls, nigga I ain’t stuntin' them hoes
I trick a bitch to suck dick
Trick, what you spend on her, we spend on clothes
Too young for me she want Sosa, shooters in the Range Rover
That's GBE, when them two-two-threes get to flyin' bitch its over
See my ring chain and my Rolex when I’m flexin'
Bitch I got to get mine, nigga get outta line, I check 'em
See this gangsta's shit done to perfection
Nigga better believe me, I make it look easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
My weed so strong, my cheese so long
Roll so many joints soon I might need a lung
Spend so many grands that I might need some bands
That's your bitch why she acting like she need a man?
I’m faded, talking mills cause I made it
Talking pounds cause I smoke it
Talking game cause I played it
I’m wasted, Rose thats my favorite
OG kush, you can taste it
Buying Cris' by the cases
I hate being sober
Dont smell no one smoking
Me and my niggas gon' roll up
Believe they gon' fire on you
You think you could roll up
You smoke by the ounce
Well bitch, I smoke by the pound ‘cause

[Hook]{*set to Dr. Dre & Snoop's "Deep Cover" instrumental*}

[50 Cent]
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
50 Cent nigga, Tony Yayo (yeah)
{WHOOOOOO... KID}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Yeah! And you don't stop
I do a 187 on your motherfuckin block
Yeah! And it don't quit
It's G-Unit in your motherfuckin ass bitch~!

[Tony Yayo]
They say good things should happen to those who wait
But I'm stuck in the game still slingin weight
For that eggshell white, that tan and the brown
For a XL-6 or a seven four pound
Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with cameras in the mirror, nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights, with flyin cooks
Cause my verse sound nice when they fly in hooks
Now I'm blowin weed yo, in Beverly Hills
With some bad freak hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer, stash box with the llama
I drive through in the blue data bomber
Heaven or hell'll prevail when I'm a goner
Cause I eat up tracks, like Hannibal and Dahmer
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
Cause life is a hustle, any day you be a goner
P89 Ruger with the silencer
Let off a clip it sound like spitballs goin through straws
We got, plenty of ratchets but not on sale
We even got villagers that hold shotgun shells
These rappers is talkin 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it, my work is never watered down
So on the first I get mo' checks than Nike Town
Sling in thirty-one hundreds, I been on the block
Since niggas did the snake, running man and the wop
When I was 15, I ain't want no workin papers
I played the strip all night, servin niggas
Listen nigga, we live like Italians in jail
I got C.O.'s bringin cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you
Fill your ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid-fire
I had you on the run like Omar on "The Wire"
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun
I'm a hustler, O.G.'s love to hate
Cause I got old school money put away in the safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback
I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck Judge Wong, he won't catch me on the corner
Nigga pay poor tax, homey you owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for your see through Roley
I be in M mansion, strippin them models
His bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the guns if you ain't got enough beef
The shit I spit'll cause an all out riot
And my new four-fifth'll cause a hollow-tip diet
I'm the type to tie up your lady, and gun butt your baby
I'm like the mob nigga, fuck you pay me~!
I'mma hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick twenty mill' and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now its time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggage spot
I need twelve 12's, and fifty-eight 58's
Cause I got eight sales and they all gon' wait motherfucker!

[Hook]

YEAH!
{Ha ha... WHOOOOO KID!!}[Produced by Dirty Swift]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 745
You drive me crazy, shorty
I need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feeling me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?
Do you believe me when I tell you you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? Cause if so girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Hook]

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Could you love me in a Bentley?

[Verse 2- Lil' Mo:]
Cuz I just wanna chill and take a ride
Shotgun in your 7-45
Oh baby you know I got your back, and I need to feel you next to me
We got a baby and you know that I
Would have another, man I want your child
Sometimes I really wanna cry, cause the love is so good

[Hook 1- Nate Dogg:]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down, and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Hook 2- Lil' Mo:]
Boy, if you really love me now
Can we walk down the aisle?
Cause you know I'm gonna hold you down
Cause when you was down and out
I was still around
You gettin' money now, but I still got love for you

[Verse 3- 50 Cent:]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?

If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could do what you like, I know you like that

[Verse 4- Lil' Mo:]
If you fell off tomorrow, you could stay at my crib
If you didn't smell so good, I would still have your kid
If you got locked up, I'd put money on your books
I'd marry you through congical visits, and it'd be off the hook
You could still keep the hoopty, if you couldn't cop a Benz
Boy I'd never dip out, like some of your friends
If the boys try to get you, I'd be by your side
Like Cleo from Set it Off, and you know I'll ride
If you gotta peel a cap baby, do it papi
And if a chick wanna a piece of me, I know you got me
You have to work at Mickey D's or Burger King, I'd be there for you cause I kknow we gotta eat
I ain't got too many friends, you know that babe
If you use your tongue, baby I'll behave
You know I don't drink, cause I wanna have ur baby
Cause I'm your girl, and them other chicks is maybe

[Hook 1]

[Verse 5- 50 Cent:]
Now would you leave me if your father, found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate, are you the one for me? Cause if so girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said "it wasn't me"
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]

[Bridge- Nate Dogg:]
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

[Outro- Lil' Mo:]
If you only knew how I feel
Boy you would know that my love is for real
21 answers to the questions you got
I'll always love you if you got money or not(*Starts off with the beat of Tweet's "Call Me,"
Then changes over to Bubba Sparxxx & Jadakiss' "They Ain't Ready")

[Intro - 50 Cent talking]
Uh, yeah, G-Unit, uh, yeah 50 Cent, uh, yo

[Chorus 1 - 50 Cent, imitating Timbaland]
Timbaland sounds so good, but I might not be ready
I don't know
If I spend a 100 grand on the beat, then we done bumped already
Now here we go

(*harmonizing over the beat - doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) (Pee Wee Herman)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Niggas look down to Pee Wee Herman)

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
50, lefty, no gun in my right palm
Bronx niggas love me, like they think our mics on (WOO)
These rap niggas not like me, they too soft (yeah)
Get shot down, I get up, shakin' shit off
You know white collar crooks, do jokes on lap tops (uh huh)
Real niggas snatch Glocks, and run up in spots
We can talk Trump talk, real estate, stocks, and bonds
Or gangsta shit, my Rugers and Glocks in palm (uh huh)
Danger, ring the alarm, kiss the ring of the Don
I conquer like Genghis Kahn, I said song in this song (god damn)
I won't hesitate to put a knife or a slug in you
And watch you bleed out, that little bit of thug in you
You don't want to bump heads with me, and get hit up
You, you ain't got what it takes to fuckin' get up
Holla niggas names on records, that shit is played out
But holla mine in your next line, and get layed out

[50 Cent - Chorus 2]
My jewels look so good, and my chain is so heavy
I don't know
If I should stunt for these hoes again, cause I did that already
Now here we go

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 2]
(Lloyd Banks) I don't give a fuck if your favorite rapper dies, to me thats my spot
I'll celebrate his burial and eat at IHOP (yeah)
I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo)
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (uh huh)
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King
(*harmonizing of "doo, doo" plays in backgroud until G-Unit is yelled)
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long
My neck's 16, and made Flex drop a Benz latin bomb (G-UNIT!)
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop
Since (uh huh) "Life After Death" and that 2Pac shit drop
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and the wrist pop
Who? where?, Master P says our watch don't tick tock
I'm cleanin' out my 6 shot, watchin' the Knicks flop
Damn near the whole damn passenger green
Thats how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (smoking)
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (damn dude)

(*50 Cent - harmonizing "doo,doo,doo"*]

*beat stops

[Lloyd Banks]
What the fuck happen to the rest of the beat man?

(50 Cent laughing)[Hook]
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and gone niggas gon' remember my name, 50

[50 Cent]
Black is flashy like Alpo, gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka 'mind me of nigga that clapped me
He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you tryna get your ass laid out in Gilmore
He had some soldiers, 'mind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like "What up comrade?"
Grimy niggas, they loved to get gully
Summertime, still had on black gloves and skullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggas from Philly woulda called him an old head
But he a OG, 'mind me of Chaz and Bump, real low key
Sounded like they don't know nothin about drama
His money sent many men through trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled down on his S-Class
Heard in DC, he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this, a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit, he got knocked
He on lock still controllin the spot from Comstock
Pop pulled up in the CL5, surprised he came
His man just got fucking murked by some lame
Heard he got it in the Range nigga Caine popped one
On his brain over some-thang, took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond mayne
In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back
"Down down baby," Nelly singin my wrist blingin what?
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise, three loaves for two pies
Son he smokin that shit, I can see it in his eyes
Comin up Wise and locs is close
And locs ride 'round lookin for wires to toast
Benny hopped out the Escalade with a few thorough men
From B-More, they sellin heroin in Maryland
His first batch of diesel, he killed like 4 fiends
His popularity grew, that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother, now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to livin the dream
Seen he pulled up, goddamn, you know his format
Bentley Azure, marble in the door, mink floor mats
Hit the hazards, out the stash box popped two Glocks
Theme song: "All Eyez on Me," 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he still gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Ty in the blue GS, stuntin like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max, Haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peeped his style son I know his steelo, he on the d-low
He smile at niggas mumblin fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggas tried to merk him, most them got found
Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a black Hummer, he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that, let's go

[Hook]50 Cent raised the stakes in his beef with 3 rap heavyweights -- publicly insinuating Diddy, Rick Ross and former record exec Steve Stoute are gay together ... but he backed down minutes later

The shots were fired Sunday -- Fiddy posted the 2 pics on Instagram, one showing a pink-shirted Stoute embracing a pink-shirted Diddy. The other shows Diddy and Rick Ross from an angle that makes it look like they're kissing

Underneath, 50 wrote the caption, "I ain't saying nothing, but something ain't right. Lmao." He yanked the pics down a short time later

The photos were the latest in 50's ongoing feuds with the rap titans -- Stoute recently appeared in a VH1 documentary about hip hop, in which he called 50 a has-been. 50's been feuding with Rick Ross and Diddy for years

As for why he pulled the post ... 50 probably thought twice about starting a nuclear warBack:

Ladies and gentleman, I know you were very surprised when you heard for the first time 50 Cent is running for the president. I like to thank you for all for tuning into these debates. Some really important issues to adress and I'd love to answer your questions and hear your suggestions. (Listen to this shit) after I propose. I'm not just another politician politicing, it's your boy. 50 - here we go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I done smoked a couple pounds, but I ain't never inhale
Been in custody before, but never in jail
Baby, I love you like America, don't talk to me fly
But I promise you if you do, bitch, I'll black ya eye
See, the hood fucked up, I got a plan for the crisis
Bring the dope in on boats and lower cocaine prices
That's stage one of my plan to pass by depression
When everybody high who gives a fuck 'bout recession?
Imagine gas price is twenty dollars a gallon
D's catch a nigga and have walk to the island
My main aim's to take away pain
It's okay, get fucked up, man
Got that purple, roll that shit
Got that pill pop, now take that trip
Got the Hennessy, man, take that sip
The pain'll go away if you get higher than a motherfucker
And I know you think you know my style
Sursprise, nigga, I done changed it now
5 years, I'm the nigga you been hating on
December 9th I'mma give you what you waiting for
Before I Self Destruct, motherfucker

[Outro]
It's 50
I'm in Detroit right now

Feautered film, I'm like Prince right now, man
It's like Purple Rain, baby, stupid
Reproduced and directed by 50 Cent starring Curtis ''50 cent'' Jackson

[50 Cent]
That's the sound of the man, cockin' that thang - that thaaaang
That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang - thaaang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya
Say a prayer for me if you care for me cuz I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it
Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot
They say I'm skinny now, but I look big in a coupe
My cousin Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans
I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh you the black hand of death, then why your name ain't preacher
If you a pimp like Ken why them hoes don't treat ya?
If you wanna ball like Kirk, now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya

[Hook]
Problem child, I'm familiar with problems
I know how to solve em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve em
Shoot em up, rob em
In the hood we starvin, you don't want problems
Problem child

[Bridge] [Singing]
And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

[50 Cent]
They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
+Blaaat+, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty
For every bar in the rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
For every stone in the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check C-N-N for the "War Report"
See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I'll do it myself, I don't need no help
Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me cuz they couldn't beat me one-on-one

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[50 Cent]
I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cuz pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass
I got "God Understand Me" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'mma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say: "'Wassup", niggas get ready to duck
My heart is a house homie, If you don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings
See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'mma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

[Hook][Intro]
I took a sip of the potion
Little SK, a little Goose, now I’m loose

[Verse 1]
Quest for the cheddar I bought shiny Beretta
I’m firing squad hard, you niggas should know better
Than to bump with Ferrari, district calamari
I kill like rebels in Warri, I’m sorry
I ball like I think I’m the Prince of Abu Dhabi
Black gold gush out the ground
Gun powder fly out the pound
I turn a clown smile upside down
That’s 3 time zones in my watch face
Still hard to tell time with diamonds all over my watch face
Twinkle like I’m outta space, I'm the big dipper
You a little dipper, pipe down little nigga
Nice wheels, but don’t talk money, that's what I'm about
I could fit your house inside my house
And your neighbours and ya yard, oh my God
This shit ain't about shit so I ain't gon’ go hard
Now kick push, kick push, get the fuck outta here, kick push

[Hook]
You’re now being hypnotised, close your eyes
And say 50′s my favourite, 50, 50's my favourite
I’m not the the one to play with, I mean what I say, bitch
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite
Still on that gutter shit, forever on that gutter shit
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite
I know you love that shit, real niggas be loving this
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite

[Verse 2]
Oh shit, now a nigga floating
That Luger German, thats Kush burning
I’m Einstein on the grind, my wheels turning
I’m out in Cali
Not in Hollywood, Silicon valley
I’m bout to get rich, I mean real rich
I’m talking Facebook and Spotify type shit
I’m not a programmer, I use ghetto grammar
Slang, pussy, I’m strong as David Banner
The Hulk, my money come in bulk
And if this shit go bad I go back to the dope
Now pay attention to the murder I wrote
This my light shit, my heavy shit on the album
Lets get right, bitch

[Hook][Intro: 50 Cent]
Nights like this... I wish
Rain drops would fall
5 heartbeats left
One last deep breath

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I got a 16 shot Ruger, I got 16 cars
All over how I write 16 bars
Ja, Joe and Jada they're fuckin' retards
I run Interscope, uh-uh Oh, my God
Your stuff I'll make it hot
You want I'll get ya shot
You're just open your coffin
You're dead men walking
Now when I'm out in London they say I'm so smart
I fired rounds from pounds I came up so hard

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been around the world and aiya-ya-ya
Must be goin' crazy
Cause I'm still down
To get down to let off rounds
I'm loadin up my 380
I can't wait 'till I see death

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
I'm tryin' to pray to the preacher man but he in new gators
My ASCAP check got a nigga new haters
The condos in Vegas - cause NY freezin'
My strap is the reason that you on the floor bleedin'
I learned the Coke game Young and Watchin' 50!
And learned the dope game fast ask Bo-Diddly
Automatic Mossberg in the all white fur
Shotgun pellets out of snow white spur. [shot] {DAMN!}

[Hook]
I been around the world and aiya-ya-ya!
Must be goin' crazy
Cause I'm still down
To get down to let off rounds
I'm loadin' up my 380
I can't wait 'till I see - death!
Oh babyyyy!
Nigga I'm gonna... I'm gonna find you

You already know what I'm about boy[Intro:50 cent]
I'mma be honest with you, I expect you to like me
I mean what is there not to like, I'm confident
I got a great sense of humor, I'm fun
I'm the kind of person you have fun with
(chuckles)

[Hook: Jeremih]
If it look this good
I wonder how it taste
Baby if I touch your body
Hear you scream my name
Would you whisper to me "It's yours"
Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control my senses
Baby ooohhh my senses

[Verse 1: 50 cent]
It's like everything's good
When I touch and you touch (one)
It smells like heaven
Way better than a tulip (two)
Your love let me taste it
Come here let me taste it (three)
Time is of the essence
Baby don't you waste it
I tell you what I'm thinking
You listen to my thoughts (four)
So you could see my vision
Then you'll never get lost (five)
If you follow my lead
Girl I'll be what you need
I put my trust in you now
Put your trust in me

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 2: 50 cent]
I'll be a true friend
Someone to believe in
I'll give you freedom
Unconditional meaning
If tonight is her night
It's her night
Just get back to me tomorrow, alright?
I'm not into cuffing
I'm not into fronting
I'm into getting paid
But blowing paper
I be stunting
See to me its nothing
Let's get into something
Should I pick you up or meet you at the tele girlfriend

[Jeremih]
Would you whisper to me it's yours
Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control my senses

[Hook:Jeremih]

Touch....
See....
Smell....
Hear....
Taste....I guess this is 6 out of 6 muthafuckers

[Hook]
Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You running, I’m coming to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothing can save ya
Times running out, I’ma get ya boy

[Verse 1]
I threw a b-boy style, bullet wound in my smile
That beef I cook it, niggas I gets down
Call it what you want, the clip, the ladder, banana
I bet when I squeeze it, niggas scatter
The hoes, that’s a whole different story
Find out the baby ain’t mine, right there on Maury
Me I make the whip fishtail, trunk full of fishscale
Raw market itself, sucka the shit sell
That’s 36 o’s of love, give me kiss, give me love
Get to talking in codes, the phones bugged
This Ferrari I get to the green, half man, hald machine
(Tu, tu, tu) I’m on ya head with the beam
So focused ferocious, I shoot ya pretty ass out them Gucci loafers
You’re fucking with the wrong one
The strong one that God gave the gift
Stop the hater shit, you wanna make it
Why would you be mad, I done made it bitch

[Hook: 50 Cent + Freeway]
Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You running, I’m coming to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothing can save ya
Times running out, I’ma get ya boy
(Get get gully, g-g-get gully
Get get gully, g-g-get gully
We get gully and we get money
Them schemin' ass chicks can’t get shit from me)

[Verse 2]
Rain drops from heaven, the angels are cryin'
It’s raining outside, envision my gun firin'
Red and white flashes, the police coming
Nigga you ain't hittin' none, why the fuck are you running
I make your momma wish your ass was a stillborn
When that eagle get to chirping on the front lawn
Where’s teh love, I don’t know but here’s the snub
Sucker barrel swallow the slug, die like a thug
You know it’s really not worth it
To fuck with me, you’d rather tongue kiss the serpent
Don’t cry we all die
It’s just a matter of time
Nigga one shot from the nine will shatter your spine
Uh, the last of my breed, criminal tendencies inside of an emcee
Fuck around I will line you
Run from me, I will find you
Forgot I’m nice, I will remind you

[Hook: 50 Cent + Freeway]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
One, two, fifty coming for you
Three, four, better lock ya door
Five, six, grab ya crucifix
Seven, eight, don’t stay up late
The monsters back
Yeah, I need a target
So I can smash their head
I’m nice![50 Cent]
Yeah.. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-UNIT!

[Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggas rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
I'm wide awake but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death waits for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through Mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, Papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggas hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
"Chi Chi, get the yayo"
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
"Chi Chi, get the yayo"
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustling backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you moving forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third

[50 Cent]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Lets get it poppin'
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like "50 nice chain"
Belagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin' good
Or cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy

Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, lets get it poppin'

G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit, G-Unit![50 Cent]
She loves me, she loves me not
Yeah, she loves me not

[Verse 1]
The fiends need me, I ain't around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now you tryin' to leave me, you never live without me
Girl I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess, stick it in, relapse
I'm back bitch, don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

[Hook]
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[Verse 2]
Baby you know, on the low, ya sister been eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know soon she be tryin' me
Heard she bi-sexual, she fuck what that girl
But boy, oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing
Kurt Cobain, we were good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this ain't new
I live the lavish life, listen if the mood is right
Me you and ya sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, if you hyper I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, your reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV
I love you, love me back, no one said lovin' me be easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I love you, I got you bare footed on glass, chasin a dove
That monkey on ya back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me bitch, you sit there and listen to them
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up when you down, then they got nothin' to say
But when you call up, I come runnin', I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down, you crowned, you prom queen
They know bout me behind your back, call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you
Push me inside you, no other man can love you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And I see to that, I'mma do whatever it takes

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, Shout out to Chris Lighty! Violator!
You know how I put it down when I put it down nigga, let's go!

[Hook]
When you frown at me is it because I won't provide for you girl
Your after me cheddar
And you friends they see it to screaming we know what your up to do girl
I'm after my cheddar

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I gave you your style Gucci this Fendi that
Burberry bag shoes and the hat to match
I like the way it look but bitch I ain't buying that
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no more Prada shoes
When I just wanna chill you wanna go out
See me parle with some other chick you wanna show out
You say I'm wrong when I dog yo ass like I should
Now you reminisce about all the time I treated you good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
When you think about me grinding my fans
You either got more than one watch on or it's to much time on your hands
They say behind every good man is a woman
So tash pull up stash the cannon linen
I'll never be your chofuer to the mall
You'll learn to appreciate cd's and posters on the wall
Fatal attractions is mad real
Last bitch I deaded got mad and swallowed 50 Advil's

[Hook]

Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
They say money make the world go round
Material things make a ho go down
I see you in your Prada Gucci and BCBG
Bitch I'm rich but I don't trick on GP
That's 5 dollar dresses and 10 dollar skirts
Bitch play the strip and put in work
Birds wanna have my baby since I signed my contract
Now I got to double up in case the condom snap

[Outro]
Look don't ask me for shit man
I ain't got nothing for you man what?
Bitch what the fuck you mean I can't sing bitch
Bitch I'm Luther Vandross in the shower
G-UNIT![Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
We in the '64, air horn blowing at my enemies
Bulletproof cap, I ain't going out like Kennedy
50 got my fanbase growing out in Tennessee
I'm getting so much head it's drawing out my energy
I'm touring now, I need enough weed to pass around
Somewhere around a half a pound of that Manhattan brown
Bitch, I'm gonna sell records, I got a platinum sound
Ranned into half the town bandana wrapped around
Nah, we ain't got no manners
And as far as the clips you know how gorillas feel about bananas
Acknowledge whenever we round
And as far as bouncing back I'm like Ben Wallace on the rebound
You still spending 10 dollars on your weed, clown
You might lose your dick, it's all kind of disease now
They ain't OG's, they grumpy, old men
Riding 'round in a chunky old Benz, nigga, those ends
I'm not the type to fall in love, make your hoes friends
I turn a friend to a ho, spend all the dough
Niggas'll start fighting by the end of the show
I got 30 niggas on stage and 10 in the row, ya know

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Get ya gun, we gon' come for you, we'll lay ya ass out
The shells hit you knees, split ya, there's blood all on your couch
Didn't think niggas would really run up in your house
Hog tying ya mutherfucking kids and ya spouse
Bitch, give us the mutherfucking money and we out
This 45th shell'll tear a fucking hole in ya blouse
Waiting for me to have a change of heart, you assed out
Kill every motherfucker up in this bitch and stamp out
Nigga, this is pressure, punks respect pressure
Catch ya stunting in something I want and I'll get ya
Go 'head ride through ya strip in your Benz on chrome
See if I won't run up in your motherfucking home
They say money make the world go 'round
I've seen my knife work, I turn a clown smile to a frown
Squeeze and watch the barrel spin on the trey pound
I'm a G-Unit gorilla, niggas know how I get down[Skip]
Everytime I'm in the kitchen, you in the kitchen
Let me finish this brick, 'fore you put that fish in
Listen, I know we just came from fishin
But I'm on a mission, you see, there's money that I'm missin
I got 'em posted, so the move and I'm gonna murder y'all
You and all the trouble goin through by servin y'all
And only cause my man heard of y'all
Other than that, shit, y'all won't get served at all

[Tony Yayo]
I went from oodles and noodles to lobster and shrimp
I went from bare bubble coats, to brand new minks
And yo my neck upgraded, my wrist's upgraded
I stay C of F, I ain't got time for Jacob
I'm still on the strip, tryin to get my grims off
Nigga tryin to flip and its a Mexican stand off
I put a hole in your grill, with the nine mil
Dressed in all black, lookin for souls to steal

[Hook] - 2X
Little bit of dust, little bit of cocaine
Little bit of dro, little bit of heroine
A little bit of ecstacy
That's why your bitch want to be next to me
We sell a little bit a everything

[Young Buck]
I put the two Mags, up to your doo rag
And rockaby baby, I'm in the blue Jag with new tags, in case you wanna chase
I never knew that, the impact, comin up out a Desert Eagle
A make a nigga wob and wiggle screamin call my people
We got these fiends pourin liters, and they shootin needles
Need to be takin your connection, cause we got it cheaper
Shit I ain't new to this, I met this air stewardess
Who knows the ins and outs on how to get it in and out, nigga

[Lloyd Banks]
Ya if I put a dress code all black, nine hows and a laser
And the party is an ink pen, bottle, or a razor
Your hollerin for praise ya, catch me in the hood with a model named Taysha
And the swallow game major
These cowards ain't gangsta, they tellin you lies by sellin you dreams
And they ain't fill ins, they fiends
Plus they rat, and it's too hot to chill in the sun
My pops 39 years old, and still on the run

[Hook]

[Juvenile]
Wodie what you want, you want dope, you want coke
Wodie what you want, you want X, you want dro
Shit you got beef, I got a tec and a fo'
You feelin' hot and moist, I even get you a ho
If you don't got no whip, I get you a car
If you don't got no skills, I get your some bars
My nigga we don't cut it, we serve it raw
Got anythin you want, play us awful hard

[50 Cent]
My 22's bling, so niggas scheme
745 I clean, digital scale nigga, fuck a triple beam
Coffee pot to cook coke, Joe to smoke, I was born to loc
Method cut the coke, 50 no joke
I ain't "Scarface", no women, no kids, I don't give a fuck
Better teach that bitch, and that little nigga to duck
With a P-90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya
If you survive you gonna feel what talent do to ya

[Hook][Produced by !llmind]

[Hook]
He gonna give you all his love
He gonna give you all his time
He won't let a minute go by
Without the thought of you crossing his mind
I be like fuck a bitch, I'm trying to stay rich
I'm trying to concentrate on hoes
Even if I fuck that bitch do the freakiest shit
By the mornin, I got the go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got all kind of bitches, a vet bitch, a beginner bitch
My phone ringing and I ain't answering cause I'm in a bitch
I'm more like a pimp than a trick, I send a bitch
50's and lead escorts, call me the runner bitch
If we going out we going Dutch pay for your dinner bitch
Look bitch, this is my life I'm on some different shit
Every different day I wake up to play with a different bitch
Bitches love me, just like I love me
Fat bitch, skinny bitch, short bitch, tall bitch
You wanna buy me shit, meet me at the mall bitch
In the strip club, let her lick your ass bitch
Get the cash bitch and then go back to your man bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a ghetto bitch, a good bitch, a certified hood bitch
She with me to do the to the end, bitch fuck me and her friend
I said I'm headed to the top bitch I'm trying to get it all
A real bitch will be there for a nigga if he fall
The club pack front to the back up in this bitch
Got on my Louie checkers grey and black up in this bitch
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck
Bitch niggas front if you want, we got swimmers on deck
Get your ass hit over a bitch
The bitch ain't shit she in a porno clip with a bitch
She can't suck dick but damn nigga use your head
She gonna find another dick to suck when you're dead

[Hook]

[Outro]
West side
This that shit right here!
Feel like it's supposed to be on that Detox!
Yeah
Niggas think they're better than me, but they're not!
Fuck that! I'm just gonna start over
So we gonna act like I ain't been that nigga for 8 years
And I'm a new nigga! Call me Ferrari! GGGGGG-UNNNIIIT![Produced by Jake One]

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Now if I give you all of me, what'chu gonna give me back?
Your body is calling me, got me feeling like a fiend on crack
Boy you gonna make me fall in love, now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me, tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

[Verse 1]
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire, mama, make it all simple
Flashback '03, paparazzi flashing flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
Mwah - it just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you, but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they liar-liar-liars
You fuck 'em they, get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, I'm still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earning
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down, baby, I'm a special kind of nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Life is short, baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferrari horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggas hating on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a lifer that get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me is to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

[Hook]

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
What you gonna give me back?
You're gonna make me fall in love
What you gon' give me, what you gon' give me, what you gon' give me
