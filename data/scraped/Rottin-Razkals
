[Verse 1: Fam & Diesel]
What's the problem, Officer? I ain't be did nothin'
You on my back sweatin' me like I'm some kid frontin'
I'm tryin' to do my thing, Ingle and Illtown sing
Double I's the thing, if you know what I mean
"What you do for a livin', boy?," I mean I rock
Not sellin' coke on the block, I had to stop
"What's your name?" - Fam
Damn yo, put a mic in my hand
This is as good as grand
I make you understand how I am
What I stand for and what it's worth
You see my life flash in front of yo face and think it's cursed
I'm the soldier rarely seen from the block of 118
I'm a fanatic, can't help bein' a hip-hop fiend
Embedded in my enzymes before I tipped my nine
At birth the world knew I was one of a kind
It's all about the music, that's all I know
That's all I heard growin' up in E.O
But yo, let's not dabble in the past
A look at what the future got in store, so I gotta watch my ass
Can my music be the saviour of my grace?
Cause you see reality written on my face
Just a taste of my flavor make you savor for more
Go from city to city, I check you out on the tour

[Hook (x2)]
Is you with me? Oh yeah!
We holdin' fort, we ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2: Fam & Diesel]
I gots many, many, huh, concepts, that's much
In clutch grab my nuts, I'm nuts like 'deez nuts'
I got the touch, huh, I take my time when I do mine
It's done when I do mine, for fun when I do mine
It's mine, mine, all mine
The rhyme and the rhythm, I get it from the mind
And put it in the body and soul and then I roll
Steppin' on my stroll, I got total control
Hold up, boy, you're ready? Here it comes
Feel the bass from the drums as I expand lyrics from my lungs
I run lyrics so rapid to catch it you need a z
It's me from '19 Naughty III', the Diesel MC

[Hook (x2)]

[Bridge: Fam]
I said, 'Helloooo, everyboooodyyy'
I said, 'Helloooo, I'm from Ill-t-t-town-t-t-town-t-t-town'

[Verse 4: Fam & Diesel]
I push the pedal to the metal and just gas on up
Keep a limp in my strut when I walk talkin' much
Tell you what, huh, tell me what's really goin' on?
Everything's the same, everywhere I go, come on
Go on, so forth and so on, I throw on
A brand new style while I freestyle, me and Lovechild
Reekin', what is it I'm seekin'?
I'm always a little tipsy, rip, see, is how I gets busy
Influencin' your choice of your listenin' pleasure
Lyrics are more than a treasure, on wax to remain forever
Clever in my ways, I amaze audiences from the stage
Build up anger, releasin' physical rage
Once the spotlight shines it captivated your mind
Eye contacts sendin' chills up opponents' spines
This is my place of business, where I'm most relaxed
So many crews stepped up and them fools collapsed

[Hook (x4)][Supreme C]
Lick off a shot, I like drama hot
A strain on my brain make me kill your blood clot
So when you 'treat, make sure you got a shield
Cos on the real-to-real I make your body stand still
Watch your back, I get dim like the night
In and out of sight to hit that ass up right
Straight from the jungle where I call the zoo
A major breakthrough, Jersey comin through
A straight line I walk, from Ill Town to Newark
Back and forth to pack stacks and vaults
Troopin (troopin) just like the soldier
Even if yer stiff like a boulder
You'll still get run over
Raise the stakes, all the winner takes
Lyrics to beats like shakes to earthquakes
I puff lye's, doing double I, till I die
An' everybody get high

[Headache]
Ill to Cruddy Click
Will leave you flattened it's so simple
Playin' little fags out like a game of Nintendo
Nobody can see this B.G., that's hard to deal with
Punks knuckle up and they better.........

[Road Dawgs]
Will he get busy, is he ready for the booth?
This tracks makes me wanna grab my gat
And lick off a shot through the roof
I'm straight blasted, everybody's askin'
Can it be the 6'3" G runnin rampant
Bangin in your ear drum
When I've finished niggas'll know what's here from
Them other fools frontin, now somebody gotta wear one

[Headache]
I'm quick enough to hit em high with the Double I
I'm lettin you know right now I'm not to try to die
Load up the clip for clicks who wanna start beef
To be raised in the hood, you've gotta have heart, chief
Headache is the name
Catchin wreck is the game
When I'm battle MC's I go tear em out the picture frame

[Road Dawgs]
Who wanna try to ???? big booty, niggas, what's happenin?
From ???? to 1-18 Dionna Warwick can't keep us gangstas from rappin
This is the Road Dawgs
Rollin' wid the Double I crew, we got it locked
From the westside of Inglewood to Bangkok
I drop slang, let my nutz hang
Bustas can't handle us, from here to Los Angeles
Niggas hoo-bang

[Black of Zoo Crew]
Yo, this Black, I'm representin the motherfuckin Zoo Crew
I got my man Sup C in the motherfuckin' house
I got my man Headache in the motherfuckin' house
I got Dueja, I got my motherfuckin people
The Road Dawgs, Rottin Razkals, and the Cruddy Click
And yo, my man K-Boogie on this track
And now we gonna do it like this
If you pussies can't give us our props
Don't come to Jersey and do no shows thinkin that they're sold out, nigga

Chorus-X2
It's like that y'all, and we don't stop
It's like that y'all, lick of a motherfuckin shot

[Dueja]
Left to right, right to left I fight to death
Mentally mad, I'm insane, but I'm the best
Cos I flip shit, get niggas lifted
And then I creep to the naughty play ground
Way down in jungle deep
To smell the indo comin' from the steps
As I walk down the block, niggas throwin up the set
Double I, for life, if you slip, you're get dealt with quick
My brotha Gutter shakled up behind the steel strips

[Cruddy Click]
Cruddy quality is heavy duty
You never knew me, pull no stu-dy
To hide the 30 to life, my ??? roll on niggas who try and do me
I send the them 60 miles south, klicklow like ????
Not even a scout can find your whereabouts
You motherfuckers can lobby together, that makes it better
For the annihilation, occasion, erasion, invasion
And I must seriously doubt if you can find a passage out
You ego maniac, ???? get blowed out
When I showed out
Ill Town''s how I stand for mind
Get props to Alpine, rip rhymes
Designed with Cruddy types of obstacles
It's not impossible
Your niggas is unstoppable

[Diesel - Rottin Razkals]
Hold your horses
The lyrical force is about to toss this
Standin in the column with no draws or losses

[Fam - Rottin Razkals]
I come to make a mess
And put a disorder on anything in order
Sorta slaughter your recorder in the way you oughta

[Diesel]
Prepare for the worst
Once my verse hits the earth
Competition's in fear, I could make a star burst

[Fam]
Wish it weren't trouble
We get it on the Double (I)
Necks get ripped in a rumble
You stumble, fumble, then crumble
Nigga

[Diesel]
Frustration influencin my attitude and mood
Not in the mood to hear it
So kid, don't step near it

[Fam]
We ain't gotta prove naythin
Zip up your lip, cool with the basin
Recognize and realize
Open your eyes, look who you're facin
I've been BEAT UP
THROWN ALL AROUN
BURNS ON MY FACE
SLAMMED ON THE GROUND

[Diesel]
The microphone is taken
You must have been mistaken
If your thought I was fakin
Swinger, ain't perpertratin

[Fam]
So if you wanna be down
Just step up, step up
And if your pockets are too heavy
You can give it up, yeah

[Diesel]
Lyrics is my life, and the rhythm got me livin

118, Cruddy Click, Naughty By Nature, the Rottin' Razkals, the Road Dawgs

And if I ain't punchin' and thumpin' I'm stompin'
And kickin'' in nigga take a step back
It ain't even all that nigga catch a cap
If ya don't wanna brawl jack
Guzzle down a 40 till I'm all full
Take another hit of the dirl with a long pull
I gets blitzed outta proper state of mind
When me and my click searchin' for trouble to find

No he didn't but I'll you

Hook:
I tell you what good with deez some and the how
Cause that's why I stays with my klickow klickow (x2)

Right out the alleys of Cali

Hitter quitter skull splitter triggers from Inglewood

Watch us bring wreck quick
Road Dawgs the next kick
Pluggin' you jugular vein it pour like rain when ya neck whip

235 thick
Ingelwood Illtown click

Low hot off the bricks trot off or get shot off in the mix

Boobie and Luvchild staying trues paying dues

Madmen with ten millimeter heaters sprayin' fools
And slaying crews

Who wanna tangle get caught up and dangled yoked and strangle

In a fight straight soldiers swingin' pipes from every angle

Keep my hand on the nitty Glock fifty
Swift with my tool to lift any fool that wanna fuck with me

Don't sleep on Jersey nor California shit is grimmy trim ya limb
Blood and phlegm is all on him after we warn ya
It's curtains kids certain things we won't allow
Cause that how we stand with ours klickow klickow

Treach:
Word to the mother my mother was the only checkin' mines
So motherfuck your mother's father if he step like mines
Swift kicking cocks I hit spots and blocks
So listen pops then I'll miss you like I miss measles
Mumps plus fuckin' chicken pox
Givin' props to all the Old school that paved the way
Plus zero I fear no hero you think will up and save the day hey
Three letters describing that ass here's a clue
S-C-K the only thing missing is you
Excuse up's excuse um you've yet to lose one two ton
Crews son doing more then leaving bruised gums
Try it riot I'll roll quiet you'll never catch the trap
Cause I ain't the the the that to flap the yap
A black alley cats can catch my back
And to that and these scrap
Back to back wreck to wreck and wreck necks
Of macks fake macks break their necks to say I take that back
You see it used to be a time you rolled with shanks and friends
But nowadays we roll in fuckin' tanks with rims
That's how it go that's how we roll pow!
Cause that's how I stand with mine klickow klickow

Hook

Gutta Nigga and I Face Finsta the two man cruddy collision

To your advantage if you could manage the damage
I'm handing when ya get the fuckin' mic it leave ya hands branded

That's secondary I leave ya floatin' like a fuckin' ferry
Advancing my chances and ya retreatin'
From the beatin' ya seekin'
Fuckin' with me and feel your fluids leakin'

On time for too much tough talk
Nigga walk and keep walking
Fore I take ya tongue and make you stop talking

I'll meet ya at death's gate when a nigga took a step late
Jacked 'em for his place he set up shot in the next state

Yo zapping all the zip zags not that all the zig zag
Shot 'em in the stomach now he's living out a shit bag

Ha ha ha fag couldn't fuck with a nigga with nine rounds

[Chorus (x4)]
Hey alright, right, right

[Bridge: Fam]
I said you ain't a really down, really down
You ain't down with my crew
You ain't down with my crew

I said you ain't a really down, really down
You don't do what we do
You don't do what we do

[Verse 2: Fam]
Isn't it beautiful, lovely, the vibe that I'm feelin'
Cause my style is so appealin'
Got you jumpin to the ceilin'
I'm back, in fact I never went nowhere, my man
This track, is Boogie's and he hand it down to Fam
You don't understand, you could never underhand
The wonder man
Comin' from the under land
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
It's a Naughty-Rottin' thing goin on tonight
If you wanna join in, everything's alright
I'm quite tight
Tip-top shape for the night
Nothin's gonna stop us now, no way in a right
Right you are
Who's gonna stop a shootin' star?
Whose aim is to go far
Like the milage on a car
This is for all of y'all to enjoy
Every man and woman, every girl and boy
Boy, oh boy

[Chorus (x8)]

[Verse 3: Fam]
Yo, I got eight wheels
I wanna roll
Or might go to the rink
And get my stroll on
K-Boggie is the man behind the scenes that makes you move
Ill Town, Ill Town, ain't got nuttin to prove
Wake up every mornin with my boom box blastin'
It's you that I'm askin'
"What the hell's been happenin"
What once was a fad
Blew up and goin mad
Bart Simpson, even with it
Dropped a single with his dad
This is dedicated to the Hip Hop artist
Those who rock hardest
They're stuck in regardless
When the radio didn't want to play
What we had to say
Now things have changed
Just like a new day

[Chorus (x8)][Intro:]
Don't act wild, don't act wild (wooh, wooh)
I don't want no bullshit out of you
(Inglewood) (Ill Town)
This is for the Homiez and the Niggas

[Chorus - X2]
The homiez from the hood
The niggas on the block
The homies locked down
The niggas with the Glocks

[Fam]
Check it, I got a crew, two, maybe a few
Who crack 40's daily, do
Crack em over heads too

[Diesel]
Word to the bone, I get stoned everyday
Can't nuttin stop me, best be on yer merry-way

[Fam]
I stands for mine and mine iz where it is
All that, so scat, there it is so, square biz

[Diesel]
Take precaution often when you're steppin
In my hood it's good to have a weapon

[Fam]
But yo, trouble stays on my mind
And when I go out, it's trouble I'm gonna find
So yo, niggas better hide they goods
Cause here we come, two homies from the hood

[Chorus 2X]

[Fam]
Same shit, new day
Huh, niggas on the corner, waitin for a pay

[Diesel]
Straight off the Bricks, droppin bodies like mob hits
Nobody could stop it, tie it up and then clock it
Step out the house with a clip or two
Down the street's my crew, puffin herb and sippin brew

[Fam]
This is what we do everyday in the hood
Locked down in the ghetto, so we up to no good
Who's takin the bad news straight to the cops?
The homies from the hood, the niggas with the Glocks

[Diesel]
Man, I ain't worried about no five-o
Because I dash through the alley, dickin Officer O'Malley, oh
But they're comin from the backyard
I got a stash in a trash, ready to blast his ass hard

[Fam]
Caught off guard, now livin hard in a jail yard
The homie locked down linin up for the mess hall

[Diesel]
I had a Glock on the block, now I'm locked up
Peepin the game, every nigga think he tough

[Fam]
Huff, puff, I'm blowin all that stuff down
Ran by Illtown, the inside's ours now

[Chorus 2X]

[Diesel]
Finish my bid at last, I'm in need of some cash
Don't step my way or that might be your ass

[Fam]
Things have changed, new faces on my block
I got a new Glock, so nigga, why not?

[Diesel]
118, nigga, yeah, yo, it's time to pay rent
Fuck what you spent, I need every red cent

[Fam]
115 ain't been seen by me in a while
Checkin out the area to see the whole file

[Diesel]
You heard what I said, nigga, keepin it real
Cause you ain't got no business bein down the Hill

[Fam]
Start the dash, got the cash, but it ain't enough
So me and my man 'bout to get into some mo' stuff

[Chorus 2X]Double I, Double I (X4)

[Fam]
Huh yeah, huh
This is all live, and all real
Niggas can't understand it
I don't know why they can't comprehend
Heh-heh, heh-heh

[Diesel (Fam)- {Both}]
I got a rugged step-back, cruddy-bat-smackin type of style
Meanwhile flip a freestyle
You know what I mean now?
Cos I've been down and kept down
Now I'm comin up
Pack a strap for roughin up
Don't you think of runnin up
(This is the music, so just use it to your benefit
Shit don't hit the Fam, my man, unless I stand in it
(So duck) what? (your face will get bucked up huh)
You've never been roughed up
(But I think it's up something)
All about income, so run your funds
Yo, we ain't the ones
(We are your friend with the nines)
Cos I get slick
(An' I get tough)
And we get rough
(So we gotta get) ROUGH
(Enough's enough, save the chatter
It don't matter
Knocked your grill and left, Fam
Cause I'm a grand slam batter)
Who, when, why? What the fuck's up?
Give it up for the rugged rough
{And we them same guys
That snuffed guys on the last cut}

Chorus-X4
Get up, stand up
Chump, throw your hands up

[Fam (Diesel) - {Both}]
Guess what? (what?)
Hard  Knuckles in the house
Swingin bolos at your heads
Knockin teethes out your mouth
Hey kids, what's that sound?
Razkals got it goin
The word's around the town
Eat a dick, lick quick
Like the chick, who's next to get hit
With a pile of thick shit
(Jump jump in), Jump jump out
(Are you ready for the Razkals), cos we in the house
(What?), nigga what?
(What?), nigga what?
(Like I told you before
We kick a limp with our strut)
{Don't ask why, who's that guy
Standin in the corner wid the puffy black eye
(Come, come around)
Tryin to see what's goin down
(If you wanna be found)
Lay around (Ill Town)
(What, wha, wha, wha, what)
Nigga, I don't wanna talk
Best to go for yourz
Or have your body lined in chalk

Chorus-X4

[Fam (Diesel)]
It ain't' easy being greasy
It's like greasy, that ain't easy
?????????????????????
When a sleazy ho please me
(I used to swing a thing
Now swingin shit harder to deal with it
Take the bass to your face
And make sure a nigga feelin it
(Peel it, reveal it)
The skill, can I get ill with it?
(Yes, you can, if you're really fuckin feelin it)
I split your tongue with my fist
If you swung and you missed
Like I told you before
My 10 knuckles don't miss
When I'm pissed
(Who could it be
But the Diesel MC
Used to try to down my style
Now you're tryin to sound like me)
I got the knack to rip a track
(Just place your bat)
Leave you with some shoulders in the ass crack, Jack
(So you gotta), hit hard
(Hold your door), or get scarred
(Posse full of vic's
Straight niggas from the jail yard)

[Fam]
Nigga push that shit
Push it, push it, nigga
Yeah, yeah

Chorus-X4[Hook]

(Fustration) How do i release the pain
(Fustration) Got a brotha going insane
(Fustration) Do what we must to maintain
(Fustration) Everybody feels the same

[Verse 1]

When will I go, Who would I see, What Would I say
When and If i go to Heaven or if i even go that way
I don't know
Who calls the shots
Who says it starts and it stops, what's what and what's not
Not me, not you, not I, not who
Not a member of the Double I crew
Take the second letter off frustration
And now i wanna fuss with everybody in the nation
Everybody feels the same (?)
Everybody goin insane (racism)
Everybody feels the pain but as for me
I do what i must to maintain

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Do i release is it everytime that I'm at my peace
Be it West or East Coast
I devote and promotes my life to hip hop for the heart
And folks who wanna toast
[?]
We ain't a hate crew we got love but hate for those who
Tramatize, sodomize, crookdelics in disguise
I'm in a state of frustrate
Now it's on my friend ain't no win
Just say I'm goin all out cause i ain't giving in
To my fustration, with my fustration
To my fustration, with my

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Fustration
How many ways does it hit us
Racism, poverty, and plenty brothas put in prison
Real niggas come from the days before the childhood of my grandpa's [unknown word]
[unknown line]
Across the nation parent's basing minds are wasting
Disgrace and temptation no one's involved with education
The limits exceed to lengths longer than a lifespan
Man take out a chance and advance from fustration

[Hook]

[Verse 4]

4:20 in the morning i ain't gettin' no sleep
Got problems in my head and the shit is gettin deep
How's a nigga like me gonna make it as a rapper
Used to ? steppin in and out the slammer
Now i gotta fit in with some type of role model
I used to sling coke outta glass and plastic bottles
Always had loot offa robbin other niggas
These fingers signing autographs used to pullin triggas
Stay outta this shit is what my niggas keep yellin
I ain't got no loot so ain't no way in tellin'
Waitin on time gettin touchy as shit
Even snappin on some niggas and throwin nervous fits
When i was a crook i ain't have problems like this
Cause i was in it for self and i ain't really give a shit

[Hook] 2x[Verse 1: Fam]
When I be coolin', man look
I just be coolin'
Ain't got nothin' to prove
Or nobody to be foolin', yo
Listen to the words that I be sayin'
Cause when I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin'
I say yes, yes y'all
To the beat y'all
Look in here, everybody in the house, havin' a ball
Yoooo, I'm over here
Yo Diesel, I'm in the rear
Of the party, la-di-da-di
Catchin the vibe from everybody
Feelin' alright again
Rollin' with my buds, Double I to the end

[Chorus (x4)]
Hey alright, right, right

[Bridge: Fam]
I said you ain't a really down, really down
You ain't down with my crew
You ain't down with my crew
Check it out
I said you ain't a really down, really down
You don't do what we do
You don't do what we do

[Verse 2: Fam]
Isn't it beautiful, lovely, the vibe that I'm feelin'
Cause my style is so appealin'
Got you jumpin to the ceilin'
I'm back, in fact I never went nowhere, my man
This track, is Boogie's and he hand it down to Fam
You don't understand, you could never underhand
The wonder man
Comin' from the under land
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
It's a Naughty-Rottin' thing goin on tonight
If you wanna join in, everything's alright
I'm quite tight
Tip-top shape for the night
Nothin's gonna stop us now, no way in a right
Right you are
Who's gonna stop a shootin' star?
Whose aim is to go far
Like the milage on a car
This is for all of y'all to enjoy
Every man and woman, every girl and boy
Boy, oh boy

[Chorus (x8)]

[Verse 3: Fam]
Yo, I got eight wheels
I wanna roll
Or might go to the rink
And get my stroll on
K-Boggie is the man behind the scenes that makes you move
Ill Town, Ill Town, ain't got nuttin to prove
Wake up every mornin with my boom box blastin'
It's you that I'm askin'
"What the hell's been happenin"
What once was a fad
Blew up and goin mad
Bart Simpson, even with it
Dropped a single with his dad
This is dedicated to the Hip Hop artist
Those who rock hardest
They're stuck in regardless
When the radio didn't want to play
What we had to say
Now things have changed
Just like a new day

[Chorus (x8)]Intro:
118, Cruddy Click, Naughty By Nature, the Rottin' Razkals, the Road Dawgs

1-2-3 I'm up to bat so pitch me an MC so I can get ill

Hey call me the mud city mangler the nigger neck yolk tangler

And if I ain't punchin' and thumpin' I'm stompin'
And kickin'' in nigga take a step back
It ain't even all that nigga catch a cap
If ya don't wanna brawl jack
Guzzle down a 40 till I'm all full
Take another hit of the dirl with a long pull

When me and my click searchin' for trouble to find

No he didn't but I'll you

Hook:
I tell you what good with deez some and the how
Cause that's why I stays with my klickow klickow (x2)

Hitter quitter skull splitter triggers from Inglewood

Watch us bring wreck quick
Road Dawgs the next kick
Pluggin' you jugular vein it pour like rain when ya neck whip

235 thick
Ingelwood Illtown click

Low hot off the bricks trot off or get shot off in the mix

Boobie and Luvchild staying trues paying dues

Madmen with ten millimeter heaters sprayin' fools
And slaying crews

Who wanna tangle get caught up and dangled yoked and strangle

In a fight straight soldiers swingin' pipes from every angle

Keep my hand on the nitty Glock fifty
Swift with my tool to lift any fool that wanna fuck with me

Don't sleep on Jersey nor California shit is grimmy trim ya limb
Blood and phlegm is all on him after we warn ya
It's curtains kids certain things we won't allow
Cause that how we stand with ours klickow klickow

Treach:
Word to the mother my mother was the only checkin' mines
So motherfuck your mother's father if he step like mines
Swift kicking cocks I hit spots and blocks
So listen pops then I'll miss you like I miss measles
Mumps plus fuckin' chicken pox
Givin' props to all the Old school that paved the way
Plus zero I fear no hero you think will up and save the day hey
Three letters describing that ass here's a clue
S-C-K the only thing missing is you
Excuse up's excuse um you've yet to lose one two ton
Crews son doing more then leaving bruised gums
Try it riot I'll roll quiet you'll never catch the trap
Cause I ain't the the the that to flap the yap
A black alley cats can catch my back
And to that and these scrap
Back to back wreck to wreck and wreck necks
Of macks fake macks break their necks to say I take that back
You see it used to be a time you rolled with shanks and friends
But nowadays we roll in fuckin' tanks with rims
That's how it go that's how we roll pow!
Cause that's how I stand with mine klickow klickow

Hook

Gutta Nigga and I Face Finsta the two man cruddy collision
Illtown's villian that's wanted for some niggas killin'
Keep my material similar to a serial killer
Peeling cats check my stats ain't no nigga iller

Now here I go with the klick klacks the Tatter rat ta ta tat tats patter

Got cha fleein' word to me Mook Daddy and Little Steven

Comin' straight form the top notch of hip hop
Niggas gather round to the sound that nigga from the gutta not
Kick that slang talk explain why ya can't walk
It ain't my fault ya hit a flip and couldn't sommersault
I'm on a route with my nigga on some new shit
Flowin' with that music nigga WON'T YOU USE IT
To your advantage if you could manage the damage
I'm handing when ya get the fuckin' mic it leave ya hands branded

Ya backwards ass assborn assbackwards
Coming out feet first and getting drugged into this next verse
On the contrary I'm not ya ordinatry adversary
That's secondary I leave ya floatin' like a fuckin' ferry
Advancing my chances and ya retreatin'
From the beatin' ya seekin'
Fuckin' with me and feel your fluids leakin'

On time for too much tough talk
Nigga walk and keep walking
Fore I take ya tongue and make you stop talking

I'll meet ya at death's gate when a nigga took a step late
Jacked 'em for his place he set up shot in the next state

Yo zapping all the zip zags not that all the zig zag
Shot 'em in the stomach now he's living out a shit bag

Ha ha ha fag couldn't fuck with a nigga with nine rounds
A rugged Cruddy Click from the guttas of Illtown

This ain't a rap along clap along song son my shit is on

Ya best to get it out the way boy
The two slickest to ever kick it now klickow klickow

Hook[Verse 1: Fam & Diesel]
What's the problem, Officer? I ain't be did nothin'
You on my back sweatin' me like I'm some kid frontin'
I'm tryin' to do my thing, Ingle and Illtown sing
Double I's the thing, if you know what I mean
"What you do for a livin', boy?," I mean I rock
Not sellin' coke on the block, I had to stop
"What's your name?" - Fam
Damn yo, put a mic in my hand
This is as good as grand
I make you understand how I am
What I stand for and what it's worth
You see my life flash in front of yo face and think it's cursed
I'm the soldier rarely seen from the block of 118
I'm a fanatic, can't help bein' a hip-hop fiend
Embedded in my enzymes before I tipped my nine
At birth the world knew I was one of a kind
It's all about the music, that's all I know
That's all I heard growin' up in E.O
But yo, let's not dabble in the past
A look at what the future got in store, so I gotta watch my ass
Can my music be the saviour of my grace?
Cause you see reality written on my face
Just a taste of my flavor make you savor for more
Go from city to city, I check you out on the tour

[Hook (x2)]
Is you with me? Oh yeah!
We holdin' fort, we ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2: Fam & Diesel]
I gots many, many, huh, concepts, that's much
In clutch grab my nuts, I'm nuts like 'deez nuts'
I got the touch, huh, I take my time when I do mine
It's done when I do mine, for fun when I do mine
It's mine, mine, all mine
The rhyme and the rhythm, I get it from the mind
And put it in the body and soul and then I roll
Steppin' on my stroll, I got total control
Hold up, boy, you're ready? Here it comes
Feel the bass from the drums as I expand lyrics from my lungs
I run lyrics so rapid to catch it you need a z
It's me from '19 Naughty III', the Diesel MC

[Hook (x2)]

[Bridge: Fam]
I said, 'Helloooo, everyboooodyyy'
I said, 'Helloooo, I'm from Ill-t-t-town-t-t-town-t-t-town'

[Verse 4: Fam & Diesel]
I push the pedal to the metal and just gas on up
Keep a limp in my strut when I walk talkin' much
Tell you what, huh, tell me what's really goin' on?
Everything's the same, everywhere I go, come on
Go on, so forth and so on, I throw on
A brand new style while I freestyle, me and Lovechild
Reekin', what is it I'm seekin'?
I'm always a little tipsy, rip, see, is how I gets busy
Influencin' your choice of your listenin' pleasure
Lyrics are more than a treasure, on wax to remain forever
Clever in my ways, I amaze audiences from the stage
Build up anger, releasin' physical rage
Once the spotlight shines it captivated your mind
Eye contacts sendin' chills up opponents' spines
This is my place of business, where I'm most relaxed
So many crews stepped up and them fools collapsed

[Hook (x4)]Check it out, yeah
Rottin Razkals, Cruddy Click, nigga
I'll have your back on that wall
Get your back off that wall, boy
Ill Town, Inglewood, boy
Get your back off that wall

[Diesel] [Fam]
Hey, word is bond I ain't the one to be played like a fool
Get my temper out of place I'll smack your face with a stool
Hey Fam, man
Girl, you know your swinger's in the house
Grab a hold of your spouse
Cos they're checkin us out
Huh, Hip-to-the-Hop
And let the Glock pop
I knock the fluid out your mouth and watch it drip (drop)
Cos I ain't fakin the funk, you silly chump
I'll be high of that skunk
I mean, really, I mean a Philly blunt
Puff the herbs, then get wicked with the words
Throwin curbs in verse that you never even heard
I'm Naughty as hell
Even Rottin as well
And be ridin your ass
Like an animals' tail
I got the flow
Only you got the flow
Just to let em know
Here we, here here, here we go
I don't know you
So you can't show me nuttin new
Who got it like that?
Nigga, you know we do

[Chorus- X2]
Come on y'all
Get your back up off the wall
Come on y'all
We're bout to,  get it off

[Diesel] [Fam]
This isn't just to let yourself go
Bump with your rump ???, say yo
Peep the frequen flow that you already know
It's from Ill Town E.O
So won't you let yourself go
(Boogie)
The Boogie makes the Boogie pass it down, give it to me
Hard as decks the same jock when his cock got a woody
Hit him hiiiiiigh - hit him loooow
Hits him in the middle just to him know
That I can sing a flow
That I can bring the flow
That it's no thing to flow
So watch me fling the flow
Yo! Congratulations
Of my generation
Creation, rules the nation, the population
Popped inflation
Huh, so next time get it right
And don't confuse our music with that other type, alright?

[Chorus- X2]

[Diesel] [Fam]
This is the focus of the rump of every hottie
(Oh, you don't know?) You better ask somebody
We can throw it like this
When the hit, we won't miss
Grandslam hit on that Rottin-Cruddy tip
It's like that y'all
You don't stop
It's like that y'all
Mack on and mack on, ock
The Naughty nappy jack-happy nigga on the trigger
Light as a feather but figured for a bigger nigga
Because of a...
Rep for wreckin regs, we get respect in this business
Ain't no beef, but watch your teeth
I'll nock you senseless with the quickness
That's for my embryo, I did my number cho
I threw my tongue out
When I was young and came out with the rugged flow
Hip Hop maniac
Vocab like a brainiac
No good hood, swingin wood and not ashamed of that

[Chorus - X4]

[Diesel]
Yeah, 98 style up in yo house
My man K-Boogie
What goin down
Jersey in the placeChorus
Frustration, how do I release the pain?
Frustration, got a brother goin' insane
Frustration, do what we must to maintain
Frustration, everybody feels the same

[Fam]
Where will I go, who will I see, what will I say
When and if I get to heaven or if I even go that way
I don't know
Who calls the shots?
Who says it starts and it stops?
What's what and what's not?
Not me, not you
Not I, not who
Not a member of the Double I crew
Take the second letter off frustration
And now I wanna fuss with everybody in the nation
Everybody feels the same
Puff izm, everybody's goin' insane
Racism, everybody feels the pain
But as for me
I do what I must to maintain

Chorus

[Chap]
Do I release, is there ever a time when I'm at my peace?
Be it West or East Coast, I devoted promotes
My life to hip hop for the heart provokes
The one that totes
Issuin heat, givin' they enemies a choke
We ain't a hate cult
We got love but hate for those who traumatize, sodomize
Crook-a-delics in disguise
I'm in a state of frustrate
Now I saw my friend
Ain't know when
Just say I'm goin' all out
Cos I ain't givin' in
To my frustration, with my frustration
To my frustration, with my....

Chorus

[?Fam?]
Frustration, how many ways does it hit us?
Racism, poverty and plenty brothaz put in prison
Real nigguz come from the dayz
Before the childhood of my grandpa
Despise another top of the boat for the blackness wanted
And crime across the nation
Parents basin'
Minds are wasted
Disgrace and temptation
No one's involved with education
The limits exceed to live longer than a life span
Man, you take out a chance
And advance from.....

Chorus

[Diesel]
Four twenty in the morning, I ain't gettin' no sleep
Go problems in my head and the shit is gettin' deep
How a nigga like me
Gonna make it as a rapper
Just a thief of da bricks
That been in and out the slammer
Now I gots to fit in with some type of role models
I used to sling coke out of glass and plastic bottles
Always had loot, off of robbin' other niggas
These finger signin' autographs
Used to pullin' triggers
"Stay out of this shit" is what my niggas keep yellin'
I ain't got no loot
So ain't no way in hell in tellin'
Waitin' on time gettin' touchy and shit
Even snappin' on some niggas
And throwin' nervous fits
When I was a crook
I ain't had problems like this
Cos I was in it for self
An' I ain't really give a shit

Chorus-X2Double I, Double I (X4)

[Fam]
Huh yeah, huh
This is all live, and all real
Niggas can't understand it
I don't know why they can't comprehend
Heh-heh, heh-heh

[Diesel (Fam)- {Both}]
I got a rugged step-back, cruddy-bat-smackin type of style
Meanwhile flip a freestyle
You know what I mean now?
Cos I've been down and kept down
Now I'm comin up
Pack a strap for roughin up
Don't you think of runnin up
(This is the music, so just use it to your benefit
Shit don't hit the Fam, my man, unless I stand in it
(So duck) what? (your face will get bucked up huh)
You've never been roughed up
(But I think it's up something)
All about income, so run your funds
Yo, we ain't the ones
(We are your friend with the nines)
Cos I get slick
(An' I get tough)
And we get rough
(So we gotta get) ROUGH
(Enough's enough, save the chatter
It don't matter
Knocked your grill and left, Fam
Cause I'm a grand slam batter)
Who, when, why? What the fuck's up?
Give it up for the rugged rough
{And we them same guys
That snuffed guys on the last cut}

Chorus-X4
Get up, stand up
Chump, throw your hands up

[Fam (Diesel) - {Both}]
Guess what? (what?)
Hard  Knuckles in the house
Swingin bolos at your heads
Knockin teethes out your mouth
Hey kids, what's that sound?
Razkals got it goin
The word's around the town
Eat a dick, lick quick
Like the chick, who's next to get hit
With a pile of thick shit
(Jump jump in), Jump jump out
(Are you ready for the Razkals), cos we in the house
(What?), nigga what?
(What?), nigga what?
(Like I told you before
We kick a limp with our strut)
{Don't ask why, who's that guy
Standin in the corner wid the puffy black eye
(Come, come around)
Tryin to see what's goin down
(If you wanna be found)
Lay around (Ill Town)
(What, wha, wha, wha, what)
Nigga, I don't wanna talk
Best to go for yourz
Or have your body lined in chalk

Chorus-X4

[Fam (Diesel)]
It ain't' easy being greasy
It's like greasy, that ain't easy
?????????????????????
When a sleazy ho please me
(I used to swing a thing
Now swingin shit harder to deal with it
Take the bass to your face
And make sure a nigga feelin it
(Peel it, reveal it)
The skill, can I get ill with it?
(Yes, you can, if you're really fuckin feelin it)
I split your tongue with my fist
If you swung and you missed
Like I told you before
My 10 knuckles don't miss
When I'm pissed
(Who could it be
But the Diesel MC
Used to try to down my style
Now you're tryin to sound like me)
I got the knack to rip a track
(Just place your bat)
Leave you with some shoulders in the ass crack, Jack
(So you gotta), hit hard
(Hold your door), or get scarred
(Posse full of vic's
Straight niggas from the jail yard)

[Fam]
Nigga push that shit
Push it, push it, nigga
Yeah, yeah

Chorus-X4[Intro:]
Don't act wild, don't act wild (wooh, wooh)
I don't want no bullshit out of you

This is for the Homiez and the Niggas

[Chorus - X2]
The homiez from the hood
The niggas on the block
The homies locked down
The niggas with the Glocks

[Fam]
Check it, I got a crew, two, maybe a few
Who crack 40's daily, do
Crack em over heads too

[Diesel]
Word to the bone, I get stoned everyday
Can't nuttin stop me, best be on yer merry-way

[Fam]
I stands for mine and mine iz where it is
All that, so scat, there it is so, square biz

[Diesel]
Take precaution often when you're steppin
In my hood it's good to have a weapon

[Fam]
But yo, trouble stays on my mind
And when I go out, it's trouble I'm gonna find
So yo, niggas better hide they goods
Cause here we come, two homies from the hood

[Chorus 2X]

[Fam]
Same shit, new day
Huh, niggas on the corner, waitin for a pay

[Diesel]
Straight off the Bricks, droppin bodies like mob hits
Nobody could stop it, tie it up and then clock it
Step out the house with a clip or two
Down the street's my crew, puffin herb and sippin brew

[Fam]
This is what we do everyday in the hood
Locked down in the ghetto, so we up to no good
Who's takin the bad news straight to the cops?
The homies from the hood, the niggas with the Glocks

[Diesel]
Man, I ain't worried about no five-o
Because I dash through the alley, dickin Officer O'Malley, oh
But they're comin from the backyard
I got a stash in a trash, ready to blast his ass hard

[Fam]
Caught off guard, now livin hard in a jail yard
The homie locked down linin up for the mess hall

[Diesel]
I had a Glock on the block, now I'm locked up
Peepin the game, every nigga think he tough

[Fam]
Huff, puff, I'm blowin all that stuff down
Ran by Illtown, the inside's ours now

[Chorus 2X]

[Diesel]
Finish my bid at last, I'm in need of some cash
Don't step my way or that might be your ass

[Fam]
Things have changed, new faces on my block
I got a new Glock, so nigga, why not?

[Diesel]
118, nigga, yeah, yo, it's time to pay rent
Fuck what you spent, I need every red cent

[Fam]
115 ain't been seen by me in a while
Checkin out the area to see the whole file

[Diesel]
You heard what I said, nigga, keepin it real
Cause you ain't got no business bein down the Hill

[Fam]
Start the dash, got the cash, but it ain't enough
So me and my man 'bout to get into some mo' stuff

[Chorus 2X]CHORUS

Naughty kicked in the door, here come 235 more, livin' rotten to the
Core
Everybody to the right, cause all I got left is my flow

It's going' down, not now, right now
So I got down with the git down for Illtown.  Figure it's the fine
Fanny

And you could ask my uncle Randy, I'm grateful for my granny nanny
That's
My mother's mammy.  Two tittle brothers with different fathers but we're
Still family

Brotha man, cause I can
Take a toll on, you understand

Holdin my port down underground in
This hell hole
You never know which way to go
Get caught up in the game
Or even trapped behind the do'
Po po, I saw one clip today
It was slow, cold Gz was around the way
I had to go, hibernate, create a different mind state
And wait till it was my turn get the first break

Chorus-X2
Life of a bastard, it no easy
Ja rasta know it no easy

[Chap]
I got locked up, the end of last summer, put me on probation
I had to hustle, cause I was under nuff frustration
I had no cash, wasn't goin out diggin in trash
So I got some weed, bagged it up, called my staff
I broke the rule, hold it, sold in the school
And if in form, word is bond, I use my tool
From Ill Town, so it's natural I'm being real sick
Big up to [Name], gun salute off mi loose lip
How could I be positive
When all I grew around was negative
The dirty lights of four, is what I live
A certain point in my life I never knew where to turn
My concern was more ganja must get burned
A young lad, never had the Dad to play, I went astray
Runnin from the cops duckin stray shots around my way

Chorus-X2

[Diesel]
You playin chicken rhymes
You kickin on a dead head-on collision
Syllables slicin your styles like surgical incisions
Envision somehow, someway you be better than me
You couldn't fuck around, you nut, I'm a ecstasy
Forgotten just as fast as you came with no name
Rottin ain't the same, servin more niggas than caine
My brain'll slain careers of future MCs, wannabe's
Rappin like Gz, I make your fuckin heart freeze
Str8 out the land of the Ill
Swear to Jersey, I kill
Anyone duplicatin my skills for real
That's on the High, tell you no lie
My mental's too aggresive for your ways to defy
Every day I'm gettin lifted, sobriety win
I got swingin serpentine in a fedral pen
Ooh, let me cool down before I overheat
Representin Double I from the Ill Town streets

[Treach]
Life of a black bastard, boy from a baby
Robbed of a father figure cause Daddy was crazy shady
My mama had to be hurt, but she ain't showin
She was raisin two little boys
And ain't want neither to know, or to blow it
Now the loner hates the night aroma
Leanin more towards the youth house and less towards a diploma
A street roamer, damn near knockin niggas in comas
No daddy to reach, so the streets teach from the corners
A goner, now the Fed's, so the family splits
Sellin out on Rally Park soon after the star taff was hit
I went past the point, they found me, had a bounty
So the life of a bastard starts a new life from the county[Chorus-X4]
One time for ya mothafuckin mind an'
One time for ya mothafuckin mind

[Fam]
I'm creative, creatin with creativity
Intensively care about this hip hop industry
It's into me
But I go lyin sayin "been in me"
Now, it's in my blood and you ain't gettin rid of me, huh
Who's to say, dues to pay
I say crews to lay
And I do's what I chose today
Cause tomorrow is the same damn sorrow
No ones to beg and borrrow
Shit is gettin horrible
Dependin on the next man's money
And the next man's money
Is always lookin funny
So then it leaves me lookin bummy
And me lookin crummy
Then I'll be the dummy
But I ain't goin out like dat
So I writes like dat
And keep it tight like dat
Cause I love to rhyme
Kickin shit line for line
One time for ya mind

[Chorus- X2]

[Diesel]
Change up your whole game plan, man, ain't shit goin on
Thinkin you bully my name, well nigga, you're dead wrong
Listen, it ain't that much you gotta prove
Try and make that power move
An' I'll smooth fuck your whole groove
The name is Diesel, of third of the niggas you wanna be
That's word to me
That's how it's goin to stay till eternity
For them other MCs, seven ain't your lucky number
Timber! fallin like lumber
Oh I'ma Let you know about yourself
Did you think dissing the ours was gonna bring you some wealth?
Back to the drawin board
I scored, I floored
Your career before it took off and soared
I'm bored with these
Wannabe's, with these trick ass MCs
Who betray bein hard tryina gain higher fees
Please, why don't you be who you really are?
Cause actin tuff makes you a target instead of a shootin star

[Chorus- X2]

[Fam]
Now tell me is it me
Or is it the people that surround me?
The ones around me
They keep me gettin down, see
It ain't nuttin like the gutter, ghetto life
Livin near the curb, word,  have you heard
I don't think so, I really doubt it
There's nuttin to do about it
But straight up rug it, route it
So let me lead you, or give you lead way
I say he say, take heed to what we say
It ain't no holdin back
A'yo we told you that
And if you rolled on us
You know we rollin back
And it ain't nuthin nice after that
After the fat jack
And 20 niggas attack
It's 20 niggas after that
Comin back to scrap
In fact
Black on black crime is just one of the worst crimes
So I finds
Somethin better to do with mines
Spittin rhymes
One time for ya mind

[Chorus-X2]

[Diesel]
I don't mean nuttin to me, nuttin at all
Fuck you all
I'm livin off the wall
Swingin shit at all y'all
It's a rumble
I make you stumble
Before you trip
While you fussin on the ground I'll be bustin your man and shit
Elbows for all those who oppose
Before your mission started
Your fate was already chose
You dose off, nigga, cause your ass was sleepin
You really wasn't ready and I caught you creepin
This hood is sacred
Indeed I take it
To the extreme
That's why I'm always yellin 1-18
All the time
In every rhyme
Dat I design
And Double I, before I kick my next line
I'm silly sizzle neck
In full effect
Before you step
You best come correct
Don't think it's hardcore, this reality rap
Jersey's on the map
Nigga, chill with that

[Chorus- X4][Supreme C]
Lick off a shot, I like drama hot
A strain on my brain make me kill your blood clot
So when you 'treat, make sure you got a shield
Cos on the real-to-real I make your body stand still
Watch your back, I get dim like the night
In and out of sight to hit that ass up right
Straight from the jungle where I call the zoo
A major breakthrough, Jersey comin through
A straight line I walk, from Ill Town to Newark
Back and forth to pack stacks and vaults
Troopin (troopin) just like the soldier
Even if yer stiff like a boulder
You'll still get run over
Raise the stakes, all the winner takes
Lyrics to beats like shakes to earthquakes
I puff lye's, doing double I, till I die
An' everybody get high

[Headache]
Ill to Cruddy Click
Will leave you flattened it's so simple
Playin' little fags out like a game of Nintendo
Nobody can see this B.G., that's hard to deal with
Punks knuckle up and they better.........

[Road Dawgs]
Will he get busy, is he ready for the booth?
This tracks makes me wanna grab my gat
And lick off a shot through the roof
I'm straight blasted, everybody's askin'
Can it be the 6'3" G runnin rampant
Bangin in your ear drum
When I've finished niggas'll know what's here from
Them other fools frontin, now somebody gotta wear one

[Headache]
I'm quick enough to hit em high with the Double I
I'm lettin you know right now I'm not to try to die
Load up the clip for clicks who wanna start beef
To be raised in the hood, you've gotta have heart, chief
Headache is the name
Catchin wreck is the game
When I'm battle MC's I go tear em out the picture frame

[Road Dawgs]
Who wanna try to ???? big booty, niggas, what's happenin?
From ???? to 1-18 Dionna Warwick can't keep us gangstas from rappin
This is the Road Dawgs
Rollin' wid the Double I crew, we got it locked
From the westside of Inglewood to Bangkok
I drop slang, let my nutz hang
Bustas can't handle us, from here to Los Angeles
Niggas hoo-bang

[Black of Zoo Crew]
Yo, this Black, I'm representin the motherfuckin Zoo Crew
I got my man Sup C in the motherfuckin' house
I got my man Headache in the motherfuckin' house
I got Dueja, I got my motherfuckin people
The Road Dawgs, Rottin Razkals, and the Cruddy Click
And yo, my man K-Boogie on this track
And now we gonna do it like this
If you pussies can't give us our props
Don't come to Jersey and do no shows thinkin that they're sold out, nigga

Chorus-X2
It's like that y'all, and we don't stop
It's like that y'all, lick of a motherfuckin shot

[Dueja]
Left to right, right to left I fight to death
Mentally mad, I'm insane, but I'm the best
Cos I flip shit, get niggas lifted
And then I creep to the naughty play ground
Way down in jungle deep
To smell the indo comin' from the steps
As I walk down the block, niggas throwin up the set
Double I, for life, if you slip, you're get dealt with quick
My brotha Gutter shakled up behind the steel strips

[Cruddy Click]
Cruddy quality is heavy duty
You never knew me, pull no stu-dy
To hide the 30 to life, my ??? roll on niggas who try and do me
I send the them 60 miles south, klicklow like ????
Not even a scout can find your whereabouts
You motherfuckers can lobby together, that makes it better
For the annihilation, occasion, erasion, invasion
And I must seriously doubt if you can find a passage out
You ego maniac, ???? get blowed out
When I showed out
Ill Town''s how I stand for mind
Get props to Alpine, rip rhymes
Designed with Cruddy types of obstacles
It's not impossible
Your niggas is unstoppable

[Diesel - Rottin Razkals]
Hold your horses
The lyrical force is about to toss this
Standin in the column with no draws or losses

[Fam - Rottin Razkals]
I come to make a mess
And put a disorder on anything in order
Sorta slaughter your recorder in the way you oughta

[Diesel]
Prepare for the worst
Once my verse hits the earth
Competition's in fear, I could make a star burst

[Fam]
Wish it weren't trouble
We get it on the Double (I)
Necks get ripped in a rumble
You stumble, fumble, then crumble
Nigga

[Diesel]
Frustration influencin my attitude and mood
Not in the mood to hear it
So kid, don't step near it

[Fam]
We ain't gotta prove naythin
Zip up your lip, cool with the basin
Recognize and realize
Open your eyes, look who you're facin
I've been BEAT UP
THROWN ALL AROUN
BURNS ON MY FACE
SLAMMED ON THE GROUND

[Diesel]
The microphone is taken
You must have been mistaken
If your thought I was fakin
Swinger, ain't perpertratin

[Fam]
So if you wanna be down
Just step up, step up
And if your pockets are too heavy
You can give it up, yeah

[Diesel]
Lyrics is my life, and the rhythm got me livin
Cross the I once and it ain't no forgivin (forgivin)
