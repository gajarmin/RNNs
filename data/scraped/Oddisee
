[Verse 1]
When you told me the truth, even if it really hurt
'Cuz you knew a lie was worse (That's love)
When you let me borrow money, that you didn't really have
'Cuz you knew what I was worth (That's love)
When I was at my worst, you would tell me I would blow
When I thought that I would burst (That's love)
You taught me how to help others, and through that discover
How to put myself first
And here we are again, just confronting fears
Whether pain, or gain, it's a bunch of tears
Blood, sweats, and peers, probably disappear
When smoke starts to clear, their persistence near
Pay attention to the folks, who're fanning the flames
They're the ones who matter most, In the gravity game
When stakes weigh you down, and they stay around
And pick up pieces, and you off the ground
That's love

[Hook]
That's love
That's love
That's love
Aye, that's love, that's love
That's love, that's
That's love, love, love
That's love

[Verse 2]
When you were giving me advice, that I seldom ever took
But your head never shook (That's love)
Both knowing you were right, never shook it left and right
Just gave me that look (That's love)
When i had to learn the hard way, and you would let me fall
But never did it out of spite (That's love)
You told me never burn a bridge
If you build it, then you need it
Whether a river or a brook
And here we are again, in the cross of paths
Darwin’s our friendship, strongest last
But our strength lies in our first thoughts that laugh at
The things that bring most hurt hearts to clash
Funk passed the ball, beat bounced the brawl
Pass it, penniless, blame games, and all
Had a few deals, time out to chill
But knowing when you need space means you feel
In love

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ooooooo, we try to tell ourselves
That we don't really need it anymore
As if a million dollars, or the bottom of a bottle
Or a carton, never cheated me before
So you started with the "I don't need it, all i need is money"
"You can give it to me, but you'll never get it from me"
Yea you refused to play, but you was still in the game
Like it, or not, let me explain
Now see
There's a tough kind, a too much kind
A not enough kind, a rather rushed kind
And the abrupt kind, a go nuts kind
A hold up, maybe we should take it slow kind
A when you know kind, it started off as friends
But then over time, began to show kind
And if we love each other, but we can't stay together
We'll do worse than better, gotta go kind
And that's love

[Hook][Intro]
Keep it on the level
Keep it on the level (2x)
(Whoa-oh)
I'm climbing up the
Keep it on the level (2x)
I'm climbing up the ladder
While you're in need of a shovel
(Whoa-oh)

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I could do this all day
I could do this all night

I could do this all day, I could do this all night
All month, all year, for my whole entire life
Who you know got a home, but seem to live on the road
Lookin' like a black gypsie, in the Caravan, arose
Music for the people, I used to rap on the train
Now I rap on a stage and I'm used to capital gain
I ain't asking for change, I'm good at coining a phrase
What I want is more than ever and never to fade away
Is that too much to ask? Good, cause I ain't askin'
Already into action, I'll have your answer retracted
So stay up out my business, it's crowded enough with me
You added as just a witness I’d rather not even see
I'm good with the folks around me, get from 'round me
Before we commence to clowning, yeah
Keep it on the level, yeah, keep it on the level
I'm climbing up the ladder while you in need of a shovel
Skedaddle

[Hook]
I'm climbing out the-
Keep it on the level (2x)
I'm climbing out the-, I'm-I"m climbing out the- (What)
Keep it on the level (2x)
I'm climbing up the ladder, while you in need of a shovel
Yo, skedaddle

[Hook 2: Odisee]
Don't give it to me easy, I like a little challenge
Winning feels better when you take a little damage
Slow learning, fast earning, stay burning, wheels turning
It's a ongoing, ongoing, ongoing thing

[Hook]

[Hook 2][Produced by Oddisee]

[Intro]
You on that third eye shit, Huh?

[Verse 1: Dyemond Lewis]
It’s all illusions, fixed gear cruising
Fixed reality shrouded from governmental pollution
I ain’t a saint, the holy ghost up in my aura rebuked it
It’s the era of indigo and they go with the preaching
I ascend as the seasons, go on and I vanish
Cause I notice I’m slowly becoming way more imbalanced
A king with the crown, firm grip on the chalice
Solid gold angel coming back to burn down this Babylon
Has told many tales, his flows you could sells
Mastering wind elements, I move with the gales

[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]
‘Cause I’m a socialite in the night, bitch get right enable
I’m boxing yo dorm, Put my Nikes on the coffee table
My tongue’s below her navel, she makes it where her skills in naval
Seals my hands on her extremities, we’re chopping up these remedies
Came in between her and I
We leave it to the constellations like should we continue relations?
I think not cause all I do is smoke pot
And make beats, and yo ass just want back shots

[Verse 3: Dirty Sanchez]
Smoker’s club, Michael Jordan how I’m killing 4 quarters
You stashing the trash, hoarder
Yo girl starting to bath water, it’s Dirty
And that’s not an introduction, it’s nutching
Dirt on my shoulders, like Hova
My niggas turn boulders soft, that’s the shit that me and jovid saw uh
And now its like Pro Era in stores
All my niggas opening doors,
All my bitches is braless, flawless more or less
Balance was the key, more action less speaking
Everybody wants a piece
Peace

Check
(Peace)
Yo

[Verse 4: A la $ole]
When I release the flows I goes over yo dome far
The nigga to represent the barrio, we hold bars
I shine further, you sons get in the bogart
You gotta pick yo road, give it a go, keep the point, God
Better with the regis my mind, they manifesting
Beast coast, yea we the pros, you don’t wanna mess with
We leave you breathless, don’t second guess the best who blessed it
Less than yo adolescence when I speak my progression

Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

[Verse 5: Kirk Knight]
This is what I asked for, asked for
Chilling at my back door, back off, mind tweaking on bath salts
Confuse my intelligence, maybe I’m irrelevant
So eloquent, being riders with a elephant
The higher rank tryna pull a trump card
When I try and do the things, I deserve all respect
Intricit my amount, boy to any amount
To any account, probably I gets em out uh

I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I must admit, I must admit

[Verse 6: Dessy Hinds]
The mental state with a nigga that was penciled for great
Following schedules, never scheduled for break
But still embrace he'll put ya' neck in a brace
Regular days went to getting paid regular
Respecting the Era where the Era’s been ascending up
Got all types of fans that’s always sending us love
And ex girls that I loved I now offend with a glove
And stayed deeper but still heading above
‘Cause Mr. Hinds always gotta float to let the people know that nigga head is above
Regular sea height, cause they 3rd eye never seen height
Cause only this Brooklyn street light gave me shine to shine for these nights
Came with the free ice to bag bodies on the beat sipes

Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

[Verse 7: CJ Fly]
Looking for who’s in charge, don’t be shocked, I’m the plug
Get inside like the socket, the surgeon, the sergeant
Energy – I put all in
I’m learning the flaw things
In the storm you stand out, you can struck and stand up
I know how to conduct, feelings electric
Well we’re connected, your buttons are pressing
Can test the reception, I sent you a message
Let me know if you get this, the question

[Verse 8: Joey Bada$$]
Seen it all in the retrospect, took retro steps
Like it’s ’93 still, got ’93 til mic skills
Even got the ecko check
Like for real there no testing, my tribe is not some Tribe called Questions
My professions are not no seconds
To no veterans and they minutes of fame
I’m a menace, insane, minus the brain as I diminish the flame
Make it rain, champagne, 'til it falls down the drain
Got my head up in my dreams
Everything ain't what it be seemin'
Don’t blame me girl, blame my semen
You got good jeans so your inseams made seamless
And off top, you’re ingenious
We took a hit of of the greenest
Now she at most fear on the atmosphere but don't intervene us
Break her body down to the genus if she leaving
She didn’t get the pic and now I see Sophia
She get the tone, sorry Bonita but
Sophia got a applebum
Sophia got a applebum
I’m thinking I should take it home
What you saying?

[Outro]
*A Female says* Who do you think Bonita Applebum is?
I think Bonita Applebum is........

(Joey cuts her off with) "Hold on before you even talk, you ever been with a Bada$$ nigga?"(Verse 1)
I never asked to be born, and death's no question
The sun's still shining off the same old lessons
Then why does life feel like an educated guess and
My thoughts are like meals I'm a sucker for the seconds
Impressions got a lot of us stressing, but how we are perceived is more about a reflection
The reception warm that I receive
Which leads to believe these hoes like what I heave
Tall women in heels, tour money and deals
Off the no bull I like all money for real
More time aboard and less time at home
Less time for broads and more time in zones
Yeah, I'm in it while flying out of another one
This is a new beginning, I'm climbing out of the other one
The dream feel real'er than it ever been
And I was aiming high like a nigga being president
The possibilities of that are seeming pretty evident
So being self employed is not seeming like a definite
But staying that way is what I'm F'ing with
And like minded people are the only ones I'm messing with

(Hook)
This so real, not knowing what's ahead but I'mma go there still
Living in the moment got a hopeless feel but the feeling in itself got it's own appeal
But I know, I'm attracted to the lights in the distance
The closer that I get and the brighter my wish gets
Excited by the risk and the chances I'm taking
Not sure what I'm putting my faith in but I'mma be alright

(Verse 2)
I'm trying to get mine in this life time
The after life is much further in pipeline
I'm in inclined to believe that but truth is, that for death, any moment is the right time
So I live like everyday is my last
But I plan for tomorrow as if I will never pass
A Pharoah on the subway
Who never had dreams of jets but fell asleep on run ways
I just know that one day, that anything I needed I could mold
Get everything you want it ain't always good for the soul
A mix of self worth, some help, a little control
And I don't know the rest, good as mine is your guess
The recipe ain't the best, to make it though is our quest
And if you choose to accept, the meaning of life is yes
Cause only God knows, those of us in the flesh, get the privilege of test
Some will fail and some will pass
We all get the same grade though when we run the path
But how you grade your self is the mark that will matter most
To separate the heart of the strong and the battered folks
Have a dose

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
Ayo, shit so real, I kill shit to live nigga, schizo feel
I got a hunger for knowledge and I miss no meals
I stay high off life and I miss no pills
I'm addicted to thrill of walking along the edge
Not knowing what lays ahead but always knowing the deal
I'm good with my decisions, the set backs and gains
Is all apart of the game, I'm ready to spin the wheel
What ever is in store, I'm ready for, for sure
The attitude of wealth with the gratitude of the poor
The balance is the challenge and I sit so still
Between callus and analysis but this no frills
I'm off the chain, been that way since slaves to Flav
From 93 till infinity I'm slated in ways
That's etched in stone
The age where we market out selves
I'm still all about the music I don't monitor plays
I don't monitor hits and I don't monitor clicks
I monitor the snare drum and the bottom of kicks
Is anybody left that still fuck with this true shit
Well let me hear you scream over top of this CRU shit

(Hook)[Hook - Maimouna Youssef]
I think I'm in a maze
I feel I'm conflicting within my brain
All these contradictions got me feeling strange
Is this the phase
Or is this the way?

[Verse 1]
I wanna make nonstop profit
I wanna make a non-profit
Close down a store when I go shopping
Open up the floor for a closed topic
And relax on a beach in remote tropics
But grind like I'm broke and I'm so jobless
Feeling like it's me against the world- It's the other way around:
We polluting and we won't stop it
I wanna stay at home and play Xbox
But my homies keep on hitting up my inbox
Say it's been a long time since they seen me
So I'm cutting off the T.V and I meet em at the next spot
I think I want a job at an office
I am the epitome of what a boss is
A paycheck every two weeks
Over losing out on sleep for the fear that I go starving
And yet I wanna take more risk
I don't wanna take more losses
Wanna be a better spender but I like the idea of not caring what the cost is
I wanna tell the truth even when it hurts, but when I get it back I'd rather have the blow softened
Wanna pray 5 times a day, am I heading to the mosque?
Prolly not, I don't go often
In the kitchen cooking dinner yeah I made that
Feelin' lazy so I'll prolly order takeout
Better yet I'm really fiending for some Shake Shack
Lookin at the plate like I gotta keep my weight down
In a circle of self worth and judgment
How you match it up gets puzzling
How to know enough is enough when your lust for a much of enough it feels just as real as a something

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I pretend that I listen a lot when people say things I don't really care about
In one ear and it goes out
And you wouldn't even notice that my head was in the cloud
But my inner voice really wanna shout
Quit crying you ain't dying
But I reply with legitimate advice like
"Keep trying they hiring"
But I really wanna tell them that they wasting time
More importantly they wasting mine
That's harsh and I'm not cold
Yeah I'm from the Capitol but I'm not bold
I guess I really am a nice guy
Keep handled that they don't win races
So I wanna be a track star
Laughing at the people tripping on they own laces
That's tasteless and I got style
And I ain't got wings but I got house
And that's why folks wanna pick my brain
I saw the big picture when I picked my frame
But I think most y'all's pretentious
Prolly just surrounded by the egocentric
And that rubbed off, so
I say things that go along with the grain like
Yeah I meant it

[Hook x2]

I think I'm in a maze (in a maze)
I feel like conflicting with inner brain (yeaah)
All these contradictions got me feeling strange (feelin strange)
Is this a phase (Is this a phase)
Or is this the way? (Is this the way)[Verse 1]
Walk around the city by my lonesome
All that what I see is where the flow from
There's a million faces in the place to be
Get it where they fit in trying slip in which space is me
Then to see am I unique or just another fish
To grow feet and walk a beach how most done
Evolvin' at a speed is hard to see I'm in the chill lane
I be in the lobby in a party where I feel strange
Never was the cool dude, never was a suave guy
More like the odd guy, want a woman to root to
Never wanted to be the type that they were used to
Now I'm flying somewhere overlooking a dream
And being overlooked did wonders for my esteem
Now I get a lot of likes like I'm the one that they grew to
Something I couldn't see when I belonged to the scheme
Separated from the cliques and I created a team
It was me, Amir Muhammad , Oddisee is the squad
Much appreciation to 'em both of them gave me a job
Tried to tell 'em I ain't part of the commerce of art
They was "Like yeah you are, you smart"

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to break out the mould
Trying to do the opposite of everything that I'm told
Try to put me in a box, already in a globe
So I don't get offended by the thinking of the old
Where I'm at is where I go, and a circle ain't my thang
So it seems there were two gangs
Not enough, but too much changed
Two extremes and we are caught in the middle
Forever lost in the process to choose 'tween
Somebody ask what do you claim
I belong to the world

[Verse 2]
Save a seat for the quiet one
I'm working hard to make my ones able
There ain't a place that I don't call home
Was dropping beats at the lunch table
Now you can buy one, gotta keep my funds stable
The Western world to me is all wrong
And Babylon becoming unstable, don't wanna die young
I'm making moves like the ice caps staying hot with a tight track
Never spoiled I don't want labels
If you can find one, take it that they all wrong
I'm feeling  to unchain you
And liberate you from the Wall Streets you occupy
There's a lot of sky and underneath it a lot of pie
And you don't need a bigger plate, just a smaller stomach
You fed up on the feeling once, and you convinced you want it
Well go and get it, be another statistic
Bit off more than you can chew and so you started to vomit
I don't go that route, I don't hang with them
I just go around the globe and not a turn for the stunting
And keep it all in house, the world is my backyard
Don't try and break my fence, nah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Whats a clique, whats a crew, what's a gang to a brother who been doing this thing all along
I belong to my name, that's the only set I claim
I ain't bothered by the politics of fame
I perform, they put on, that's the norm, trying to get me on a song like baller this, shooter that
Then they got wrong mic
This the wrong platform, they about the wrong life
This is for the people I'm just trying to cut a path forward
Trying make some music for the future that will last long
Though the never ask for it
I'ma give it to 'em, I'ma give it to 'em
Pioneering tunes and forever I'ma live through 'em
Word to Bob Marley he put memories in melodies
It's relevant in the present though he made it in the 70's
That right there was telling me the classic where it better be
And if it ain't then it don't deserve to represent the pedigree
Part of the solution, or part of the problem
All the moving parts in the process revolving
What are you involved in, answered my calling
I belong to the world[Verse 1]
You wear the face of strength
The armor of a tank
Keep ya' calm in a bomber's brink
Your eyes are another paint
I seen their true colors through your blinks
Thin out I'm not here to exploit your chinks
More to reinforce 'em,  from the forces sent to see you sink
Stay afloat, and stay a while, and take a break
All you hear is orders barking, brick
And mortar stopping walls and space
What a shame becoming blame of roots, and no escape
Closing gates on fate like all mistakes are born in place
All it takes is pressing forth with form and grace
Forge a bond with more than hate
Meet these words with open arms
And plant your feet the planet shakes

[Hook]
Counterclockwise you're going in
While you make the same mistakes
Counterclockwise you're going in
Eleven, Ten, Nine, Eight
Counterclockwise you're going in
Seven, Six, Five, Four
Counterclockwise you're going in
Three, Two, One, Twelve-, Time

[Verse 2]
Let me in, let me closer
Let me hold on to what you can’t composure
I’m no pushover, more like a boulder
Or come test me and rest on my shoulders
I really mean it
I know you’re the meanest to me ‘cause I’ve seen your hold ups
And you don’t know trust, you only know bluffs
This world is so tough
Guess you’re some kind of soldier
Hand on your holster, ready for it and it’s over
You ever pulled the trigger early it hurt me before i get to closure
I won’t beat you to it, i ain’t trying, i ain’t lying
I’m just speaking truths and you’re implying that I’m hiding
I’m the mirror and all you see is you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't really wanna make calls much, don't talk on the phone but
You can hit me on the cordless, in the forefront where I store us
On the tour bus where the beats loud
We can speak now, if you ain't then it's all hush
Quit acting like a loner, try growing up
We were young, when we thought the whole world would disown us
Now we  own up to the spilled milk, and the real help is the go rough
When you show love, and it heal welts, sho 'nuff
You know I got your back-, and that's just speaking facts
So when I keep it real, it's not me you attack
But anger is your drive, and that there ain't my map
If fire's all you have, then water meets your match

[Hook ]

[Reversed]
While you make the same mistakes
Eleven, Ten, Nine, Eight
Seven, Six, Five, Four
Three, Two, One, Twelve
Time[Verse 1: Marvin Gaye]
Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy bout you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby till I don't want to see

[Hook: Marvin Gaye]
Ain't that peculiar a peculiarality
Ain't that peculiar peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar a peculiarality
Ain't that peculiar peculiar as can be

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye]
I've cried so much just like the child that's lost a toy
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
But I'm so much in love with you baby till I don't want to see

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oddisee]
I know the question that I'm asking and the answer ain't correct
And if loving you is wrong well then the answer won't be yes
So I'm lying to myself cause laying next to you the best
Every second in your presence worth a minute of neglect
But them minutes turn to hours and them hours turn to stress
Am I courageous, or a coward that's unable to accept
That I'm here but you left, I mean you here but you ain't right
Yeah you right here but you ain't like with me so I need to step
You would think that moving on wouldn't even be a sweat
I mean yeah you do me wrong but I conveniently forget
I just harbor on the better like whatever to the doubt
When you try to plant a seed I just see a weed in drought
As you twist your lips to lie and it's leaving out your mouth
I decide right then and there that I won't even hear you out
I know that love it peculiar but you are even more so
How you even wear your heart on your wardrobe?
Lord knows[Verse 1]
One time for setbacks
One time for progress
Have hatred for the matrix or fall in love with the process
Not enough sleeping
Way too many prospects
Always feeling fatigue but I have yet to need alarm set
I'm just bout the realest of things
Ain't that the logic?
Lie awake with a dream and then fall asleep with a concept
I hear a lot of chatter about hustling on the daily
But when did the discussion come pay me? Never
This the man that's behind the words that do whatever it takes
I'm not too proud to eat the scrapings off plates
Turn your nose up
You're missing out
What this about?
Having holdups?
Well you can eat the chips on your shoulder
Know what
That ain't something that you can learn
But on the way you could earn
Rode through the fixes and the clenches
Never make a U-Turn
And if you do
You ain't ready for what anything cost
Youngin' you soft
Run along with your loss and step off

[Hook]
You ain't got the skills for this
Nah, you ain't got the build for this
Nah, you ain't got the real for this
You ain't got the chill for this
Nah, you ain't got the smarts for this
Nah, you ain't got the art for this
You ain't got the ear for this
Nah, you ain't got the tears for this
Nah, you ain't got the fear for this
You ain't got the years for this
Nah, you ain't got the heart for this
Nah, you ain't got the heart for this
Turn it up

[Verse 2]
When do I not have a lot on my mind
Contemplating what to do with my time
I'm pursuing a grind that runs faster than my passion and I'm
Tryna match it with the habit to shine
Money coming and going
Predict the pattern what I'm tryna define
Already knowing is a tragic decline
Before the show end
Show up with a "I know what" instead of "why"
The answer ain't in the sky don't expect a reply
I'm just expecting decline
I'm scared to death that
This the best I'ma get before God come and collect his breath back
[Arabic?]
So I don't sweat that
I got a lot of blessings at stake
And I would hate to take them all in the vein
Like I was shooting up base
I'm in the trap you might know it as states
A  Murryland boy who wants the world to rejoice at my recording of tapes
Y'all don't hear me why

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My mother worked the register all the way through her pregnancy
Less than a week from getting me she was working to better me
Pop's selling coke out on Lanny Park in the 70's
He hustled for the struggle to stop the troubles ahead of me
That's when he had a diner off of New Hampshire Ave
Didn't last, Reaganomics set the market to crash
When I'm back home I always make a point to go past
To see the spot as a reminder of how the good could go bad
This the world that I inherited
Furthered it through the murderous week, and meager the nervousness
Look at me I'm impervious
Take your best shot and make sure that I'm done
Cause if I'm not I'll come back to take the life from your lungs
I fight The Good Fight
The merits of my actions is slow
Overnight: Nothing worth it would grow
This I learned from the modest of folks
Fake artists with your targets' to blow
Y'all implode
We ain't guarding your soul
Yeah

[Hook][Verse 1:]
When George Bush took the oil from the soil
I was in front of the counter buying some milk from the Arabs
In the land of honey I order fries from Chinese surviving off of what's in the foil
Gallon of gas, 2% is the same price
So it seems to the villain goes the spoil
It's cheap fuel, fried rice to my brother man
Cheap fuel, pipelines from the motherland
It's all the same, right?
On the other hand supply and demand could fill the corners off a late night
It's that suffering bestowed upon us by that great white
Not Columbus but Colombians
Cause ain't no coca leaves growing in the District
Of Columbia, so the rut we in
Got to be the best example of some pimp shit
Hit the strip, nigga, get that money and bring it back to daddy
Our forefathers been giving us the shaft
Back lash of a whip, to them whips like the back of Caddies
But we don't give a fuck cause we gettin cash, exactly

[Hook: x2]
This is everything you want, it's everything you need
This is good old fashioned American greed
See we get it how we get it and we spend it how we spend it
Cause it's good old fashioned American greed

[Verse 2:]
I want that dollar, but when I got it it's not enough
Fucking forget it, you think I'm quittin, you out of luck
Cause I'm addicted to picket fences and getting profit
Fuck penny pinching and pissy pensions amount to what?
Never stoppin killin myself to make a living
Make it, I spend it, they lend it, I take it, they print it, I fake it
Them laws invented by those who break 'em, I bend 'em
I'm painted as heinous by hypocrites who feel offended
Blue collar due to the stains from the blood of royals
Freedom rang, freedom rang but it didn't holler
Hard knocking at opportunity's door for life
Cause you can only reach the buzzer if you is a scholar
Higher learning, higher earning at the same time
The fire burning in the ghetto is about to boil... in the celebrated plot
I got everything I need but but I want everything you got

[Hook][Produced by: Oddisee]

[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la
I know I invited you, I still want you to leave now
This is a whole long thing just telling you to leave my mind, leave

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
I woke up down in this dungeon
I've made mistakes in my judgements
I've built you up in my head this is my prayer for your reduction
You're not my aunt, uncle or cousin
Not your nephew or your husband
You think just because you buzzin' you got licence but you doesn't
I hugged you like a glo-worm, come down now cause it's your turn
I ain't got nothing but time I like that long haul to that slow burn
I did too much of my homework
Killed my confidence with this research
I've put people on pedestals ego's reaction is knee-jerk
I'm trying to work on my weakness
It's not all roses and peaches, it's no secret
I've found my self in a funk for a whole weekend
Over email failures and DMs
"Did they get that shit? Should I re-send?"
What should I do when I see them?
Talk all soft and passive like Cleveland
Even wise men can go mindless
Voluntarily rocking them blinders
It generates all this shyness calling some other human your highness
They forgot about when they punched clocks
With Capri Suns in their lunchbox
Bad haircut with those sunspots
Drank fruit punch and wore dumb socks, yeah!

[Hook]
You're not my moms, you're not my father
You're not my food, you're not my water
Not your earth, you're not my lover
What the fuck is my problem?
It's a prayer for the American religion
You're not my food, you're not my java
Not my nurse, you're not my doctor
Not my priest, you're not my lama
What the fuck is my problem?
It's a prayer for the American religion

[Verse 2]
It's not worth my attention
Let alone all of these mentions
This first time is a warning, the next move is suspension
I got my own lapses in thinking, my processes were stinking
You're not Gandhi, you're not Yoda, you're not President Lincoln
Give a fuck if you was Oprah, Wolf Blitzer, or Al Roker
If you try to put yourself over I'll laugh at you like The Joker
This Hellfyre is my culture, put magic all in these cold words
I'm you as the slogan put up mirrors instead of these posters
Watch me smash all of these idols got all my own heavyweight title
There's no upper tier, we're all peers unless y'all want to be rivals
Talent's just a foundation rapped in festivals and in basements
If I ever lost my head I got good friends to replace it
Gives a fuck if you're on TV, you still poop and you still pee-pee
You sat down and got started not knowing there wasn't no TP
You got up then and you waddled
That shit might happen tomorrow
Whether you're a ball player, a stage actor, or international model
I don't care, neither should no one, I'll say that shit to Hulk Hogan
Obama down to Joe Rogan
Head of the studio that made Frozen
My brain is variable tape speed, SubGenius or hayseed
Try waving your resume, all of a sudden I can't read, yeah!

[Bridge]
Get your name, fame can make you evil
And that's the shame cause we done lost so many people
It gets ingrained and we start behaving like a sheep do
This song is a prayer you should aim it where you need to
When you say it they believe you
This is a prayer and you should aim it where you need to

[Hook][Hook:]
Y'all know my steez, y'all know my style, I keep it gritty
Y'all know my means, y'all know my how, I rep my city
No time to sleep, the time is now, I get it quickly
I don't care about another man's grind, it's all about...

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I'm a dude about his paper, always kinda been
If I was doin anything, see, I was tryina win
And if there was no competition, listen
I would make myself the opposition
Fencin with the grind within
It's just my nature, nurture is the way of haters
Learn to like me, I'm connected to the kind of men
That could make ya, break ya
Ties to the underworld, lies with a cover girl
Lies to the other girl home sendin texts like, 'What time you in?'
Reply later, the studio be my groupie ho
In her all night, tryina get my song right
Hopin that my verse was tight like my first was
First the bus, then the drop, first the buzz, then the top
Happen any other way and you will smack the surface
I'm prepared for the wayward climb
And unaware of other ways to grind

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
Knowin when to hold 'em, man, knowin when to fold 'em, man
Word to Kenny Rogers, nigga, you should learn to dodge a nigga
That ain't got no focus, man, that there is a hopeless man
That ain't got no rod, so niggas fishing for a problem and
That ain't my concern, took a couple times to learn
Reputation for the fakin is the only thing you earn
If the promises you makin you ain't keepin, then in turn
For the effort ain't remembered but the failure will be burned
In the memory of enemies disguised as your peers
If you ever drop the ball - that disguise disappears
So I learned to minimize niggas that get inside my enterprise
I find that's the way to stay clear
Yeah, handle biz with my partners like a Beretta spray
Cause everybody fuckin with me's in a better place
Yeah, we doin more than gettin by
Fixed time to get an infinite supply
It's all about mine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tranqill]
There's two types of brothers in this world that we live in
The ones that love to hate and the ones that be gettin
Stacks, cause ain't no place like business
Stay up on my grind, no waste, no pigeons
Pops taught me well, but them streets got the better
Ghetto black youth vocalize for that cheddar
Meals didn't come, so was out with the fellas
Copped a few crumbs, ( ? ) jealous
Comin straight ( ? ) get the finger out the nose
All I know is hard work, dedication and yeah it shows
Never paid mind to chickens or peoples I didn't know
As long as paper comin in you see the smile to a glow
Hey, always ( ? ) no recliner
Focused on my dreams, major ( ? )
The stakes are high, never mind I'ma find ya
Point the finger at his lung, trust that man is minor[Verse 1: Oddisee]
Welcome to the back of my mind
Where brain cells are chained cells, locked in solitary confine
I hope that they may never see shine
Where the insane dwells is not a place for people, way to
Lethal at times
See the demeanor I present you is kind
But the truth is I'm ruthless
I plan to do this until I'm toothless and dying
See I've realized it now, that most of my pals
Will never get the
Chance to see what they were dreaming about
Well look at me, I must be a nightmare for those
Who was right there, so close, not close enough to see
May you live vicariously, if you helped
Me on my feet, know i'ma be there, always around
Ironically the honesty is profound
It's the ones that left me on the ground that don't fuck with me now
Die slows brothers, die
Painfully
I'm in the, back of my mind this ain't a thing to me
I'm trying to be a better person, the more I get ahead I worsen
I use to have a higher tolerance
For when people be talking shit
Now I just put them on mute when they're cursing
I know we ain't
Perfect but I try to be above stooping low
Negativity ain't worth the exertion
But lately the
Thoughts in the back of my brain that I contain
Be leaking out, I'm speaking out through these
Verses this is what it is, cut throat is the biz
You either hold the knife or hold the wound, I'm
Trying to live
My competitions in need of no help, they're good at killing them selves
But I assist
Them, cause I hate to see them bleeding on shelves
I'm pretty selfish & I know it, i do my best
Not to show it
Sometimes though I can't control it, i let it go & expose it
I say some shit that's
Insulting & proud that I am the culprit
& hope you find it revolting, that what's from the back of
My mind[Intro] [Phonte talking]
Yeah, y'all know what it is man. Kev Brown
Tryin' to get this nigga to finish the album
Hell, at least start the motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin'?
Drove all the way up from North Carolina to do a lil' somethin'
I'm gonna give it to 'em like this yo
Check it, check it, check it

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Even though they try to hate and defile us
They could never stop Tay from being the foulest
New Jack Swingin'
I break it down like Cal West
Y'all be all be sure to put your doe where your mouth is
And cop everything we come out with
Cause Kev's beats turnin', my rhymes burn like Auschwitz
Niggas had their eye on Phonte form the outset
Cause I keep things simple and plain/plane like SouthWest
On to higher heights
Put the mic down
This is my advice
Cause Tay make the crowd say "Ho" like Heidi Fleiss
Hands in the air and
Sonin' these niggas that makes me apparent
Four years ago my girl made me a parent
Four years later Kev's beats we be sharin'
Goin' back in forth in the car straight illin'
And they say I'm raisin' hell, I just call him Dillon
And right now I'm chillin' in Kev's crib
Y'all know who the best is
When he drop the beat and it bangs
Drove up 95 with sixteen of them thangs
And I'm out till y'all see me again
It's Phontigga c'mon

[Hook] [Kev Brown]
24-7, 365, I bring it to you live
Whenever we arrive
That's right
Right
It's about that time to get in the state of mind
With beats and rhymes

[Verse Two] [Kev Brown]
Action packed
Hit 'em with the high dosage
Deliver the rap postage
Got it sewn up with no stitch
It's the regular thing
Cell phone got the regular ring
Name got prominence
Write bars like alcoholics check out the audience
Old school, sometimes I'm anti-social
And won't speak, stay cooler than Cochise
Drop poems over the beats to hold the streets
Comin' around
Constant, touchdown like offense
Under my cleats is where the comp is
Swarmin'
Either on stage or recordin'
And crossin' my path is where you lose your fortune

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [Oddisee]
How I do it is raw
How I do it is fresh
How I do it to death
Y'all niggas ain't ruinin' pursuing these checks
O on the road to riches and won't slow down for bitches
See I'm programmed for business with no glitches
So I won't get frozen, hold position
With flows that'll go the distance
When I speak, y'all supposed to listen
Like I'm the teach
In a class of my own, like I'm slow, I'm kiddin'
But on some real shit
Oddisee means journey so when I rap y'all niggas on some field trips
Welcome to the nation's capitol
Greater Washington
My nigga, we after loot
If you talk about rap music around here and our names ain't in it
Then you really ain't in attendance
So quit pretendin'
Yo Kev
Tell 'em thank me cause they style been invented
Low Budget forever in it
And I'm out[Verse 1]
Walk around the city by my lonesome
All that what I see is where the flow from
There's a million faces in the place to be
Get it where they fit in trying slip in which space is me
Then to see am I unique or just another fish
To grow feet and walk a beach how most done
Evolvin' at a speed is hard to see I'm in the chill lane
I be in the lobby in a party where I feel strange
Never was the cool dude, never was a suave guy
More like the odd guy, want a woman to root to
Never wanted to be the type that they were used to
Now I'm flying somewhere overlooking a dream
And being overlooked did wonders for my esteem
Now I get a lot of likes like I'm the one that they grew to
Something I couldn't see when I belonged to the scheme
Separated from the cliques and I created a team
It was me, Amir Muhammad , Oddisee is the squad
Much appreciation to 'em both of them gave me a job
Tried to tell 'em I ain't part of the commerce of art
They was "Like yeah you are, you smart"

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to break out the mould
Trying to do the opposite of everything that I'm told
Try to put me in a box, already in a globe
So I don't get offended by the thinking of the old
Where I'm at is where I go, and a circle ain't my thang
So it seems there were two gangs
Not enough, but too much changed
Two extremes and we are caught in the middle
Forever lost in the process to choose 'tween
Somebody ask what do you claim
I belong to the world

[Verse 2]
Save a seat for the quiet one
I'm working hard to make my ones able
There ain't a place that I don't call home
Was dropping beats at the lunch table
Now you can buy one, gotta keep my funds stable
The Western world to me is all wrong
And Babylon becoming unstable, don't wanna die young
I'm making moves like the ice caps staying hot with a tight track
Never spoiled I don't want labels
If you can find one, take it that they all wrong
I'm feeling  to unchain you
And liberate you from the Wall Streets you occupy
There's a lot of sky and underneath it a lot of pie
And you don't need a bigger plate, just a smaller stomach
You fed up on the feeling once, and you convinced you want it
Well go and get it, be another statistic
Bit off more than you can chew and so you started to vomit
I don't go that route, I don't hang with them
I just go around the globe and not a turn for the stunting
And keep it all in house, the world is my backyard
Don't try and break my fence, nah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Whats a clique, whats a crew, what's a gang to a brother who been doing this thing all along
I belong to my name, that's the only set I claim
I ain't bothered by the politics of fame
I perform, they put on, that's the norm, trying to get me on a song like baller this, shooter that
Then they got wrong mic
This the wrong platform, they about the wrong life
This is for the people I'm just trying to cut a path forward
Trying make some music for the future that will last long
Though the never ask for it
I'ma give it to 'em, I'ma give it to 'em
Pioneering tunes and forever I'ma live through 'em
Word to Bob Marley he put memories in melodies
It's relevant in the present though he made it in the 70's
That right there was telling me the classic where it better be
And if it ain't then it don't deserve to represent the pedigree
Part of the solution, or part of the problem
All the moving parts in the process revolving
What are you involved in, answered my calling
I belong to the world[Verse 1]
I know I'm hardly ever home
And it's hard to ever get me on the phone
But you get me, I'll never leave you alone
You ain't with me but I got you
I'll spot you if your money's ever low
But kill all that pride shit cause brothers don't hide shit
Different mothers never made us siblings divided
Our father taught us lessons through the way he provided
When talking about bonds this as strong as the tie gets
What ever you choose to do in life, I'm behind it
And shout out to my brothers not related by blood
Some people think I made it, if it's true it's because
I had a team that when shit got real, and I doubted my dreams
They'd remind me it ain't as hard as it seems
I just hope that I can pay them all back for the advice that they gave
Will I ever match the price to be paid
I don't know but I'll spend my whole life trying to make things right
If you need me, I'ma be within sight
And we gon' be alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Crazy to be your older brother
There's women but my sisters in the category other
I guess I got a fear of some shit that I did
Being done to them by some nigga they love dear
I only hope that the lessons that I gave them as kids
Stay with them in relationships and they know the biz
Cause y'all are young women now and I see you as such
No need to worry cause the cloth that we cut from tough
Y'all troopers in the moment of clutch, don't ever give up
But when things rough, you know I'm there
A liver, heart or kidney know that you've got a spare
I hope to be your role model, a best friend and brother
From the bottom of my heart, I love you
The world is yours but I'ma hold it till you're ready
And hand it over to you when your situation's steady
Just finish your college, live a little, and make some mistakes
The type you bounce back from, no permanent aches
And I got you if it's ever more than you can take[Verse 1: Uptown XO]
Get ready it's heavy, It's deadly it's 70's
80's, 90's relevant, ever since heaven sent
Evidence better men, let 'em in
Better get etiquette, stepping in my city
Crack right up the block from the president
Smell it as soon as you step in it
(You smell that shit?) Yup there it is
The block is a mother, that segregate parents get
Overshadowed by arrogant
Concrete boulevard, avenues, terraces
Howard you to the home of the terrapins
Never get shit twisted
'Cuz it will be off with your head, and it
Won't be easy to put on your head again
You 'gon feel this, killaz gorillaz
We the trillest, we the villains, the sickest
They said that i couldn't, but look at the way that i did it
The picture we painted about life,coming up right here in the district
We made it cool for K.Dot to do what he do
Oddisee better than Kanye too
Real DC nigga not that other shit, before rap
Was in the trap my gun was the publicist
After Alpo you couldn't come to my city
And you ain't know who Wayne Perry was 'fore jay said it
One album went to number one in the city
We functionally dysfunctional you let them tell it
I know you ain't think that the brothers was through
Fuck it we better than all ya'll too
Call y'all crew, trap rap, that's all ya'll do
This mac in my back pack, will make you call out truce

[Verse 2: yU]
This what they wanted- uppercuts to they stomach
Nup yo ass, and get busted on the mic whenever
We touch it
Look what them suckas loving, that shit that ain't saying nothing
Ahaha I get to chuckling like fuck 'em we way above 'em
Something coming with substance, and crushing that's how we does it
Do this rulers you foolish we finish fellas for fronting
I'm from where dollars are printed
Many monuments in it
Senate be signing shit that determine how we be living
And if you bullshitting
They getting your paper properly like monopoly
So if you don't save up neighbor, wake up you got to leave
Partna' if you do not agree then have a lot of cheese
Or else it is: Officer please take these cuffs off of me
The talk is cheap, less living, better we all would be
Listen if the Diamond District is what you want to see
We stalk the beat so awkwardly, like all of them raw emcees
So what up, put an apostrophe after the awesome three

[Verse 3: Oddisee]
The prodigal sons of the city returning
From the ashes where we rose when the city was burning
From the riots in the streets to the streets that be quiet
The city's ours, you don't believe me come meet me, and try it
I know you mad that a nigga from the county be repping the entire city I do it better without a question
You don't like it, I'm sorry, you niggas sorry, and my shit is absolute, and you prolly
Aye, let me kill these niggas more, let me dig these ditches more, let burn these bridges more, I don't need these niggas though Something they already know, so they say that we cool
You don't fuck with me, my nigga I don't fuck with you
Don't try to be difficult, go on step aside
Diamond District's the crew, and for the city we provide
Taking it international all the way from the capital
This March on Washington, get ready for the ride[Hook: Nick Hakim] x2
Don't judge a book by its cover if you don't even read
There's no shame in saying that you're not up to speed
No you're just scared
Yeah you're just scared

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I got a real bad habit
I think I know everything 'fore it happens
Few times I was right, didn't help
And I only made a know-it-all know without askin'
To the point if I didn't know the answer
I would make it up like the meaning of a canvas
I never should've went alack with a guess
'Til I go off on a round if you say I ain't correct
But that got real old real fast
I think I had a fear about bein' on the outside
Or the in while everybody out
I just wanna be the first yellin' out, "It's about time"
I don't have a clue what I'm doin' most times when I wake up in the mornin'
Be a fake in the mix? Nah I'd just rather be a real not knowin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
I was out at an event one time
Tryna meet people and such
NY stuff where people think you're cool
Cause your crew seen skippin' a line
Once I get inside I was chillin' out
Tryna feel the vibe, tryna feel it out
Feelin' out a place with a look up on my face
Like I wasn't really feelin' it much
And here she come
Lookin' like she run a blog about head
Let me guess: you don't need me, do yoga every week
And you only hang out here
I'll digress, I was far from right
She was far from down, she was so polite
It was no pretend, could've lost a gem
Next chapter, begin

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Oddisee]
You know my color, guess
But underneath remains courage you ain't discovered yet
Judge me on the surface and publish me as another threat
I'm far from it, got more in common than you would guess
Have a discussion, stop your assumptions, you know me best
It's hard to read anybody but if you never try
How can you say you're better without the measure to sympathize?
The internet, has exposed us but we all in disguise
Maybe camouflaged to protect us as we begin to brag
And this is why I'm freakishly in control of my enterprise
They'd rather spread a lie than sell the truth to get televised
May not have a clue but that don't stop their detective eyes
I tell these guys: You don't know me, you don't know me at all
Does bein' cool with my homie make you cool with me? Nah
I got layers to my person and the first one is thick
And you've never met the person within, it's far deeper than skin[Intro]
Yeah, I like that
Oddissee I appreciate the recommendation
Let's go, yeah, yo

[Verse 1]
Name Substantial, address Nunya
Baltimore resident but people know I'm from the
County where the Prince is a G, it's no wonder
That even in the dead of winter, the block is live as summer
Where dudes got that work, but I'm ji' mo' selective
Pass the line that is second you will find my objective
I'm seeking a position that will further my development
While fattening my pockets cause I don't rhyme for the hell of it
You need my work experience and past employers?
I'm down with QN5. Former U.V. Ink owner
And I use to be with Hyde Out and the late great Nujabes
Wherever I go my motto's "Be great do your best"
Responsible for making sure that we stay stupid fresh
Locally and globally while they help me get these groceries
And keep the fam eatin', I keep the fans fiendin'
And hit them with the potency of a professional, dope MC
You know it's me!

[Hook]
Can't speak for these other guys but
You can check my resume man, I'm qualified yep
Why would I lie bruh, (Nobody as fresh as this
Hit man for higher, check my references!)
Can't speak for these other guys but
You can check my resume man, I'm certified yep
You can put'em high up, (Nobody as fresh as this
Hit man for higher, check my references!)

[Verse 2]
I should be your 1st pick, long before the second interview
3rd LP's a 4 out of 5 minimum
Even with short pockets stood taller than Sentinel
Drive is uncanny, not your average individual
You'd think I graduated from the Xavier Institute
But School of Hard Knocks is where I took my classes
Where I got my Master of Ceremony tactics
My Poor Righteous Teachers taught me to make only classics
You may know me as this Educator and a Vocalist
Who the hell you know's a Team Player and a Soloist
Can dress to impress but I'm fly when I'm plain
Too thorough, if I quit you would hire me again
So fire him if he lame I've come for what's mine
Work around the clock so I can keep up with the times
Since elementary I flipped a dub from a dime
While they get the pink slip I get the W-9

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm the man for the job, while these slackers do jobs for the man
Knowing that it blows, sometimes it's involving their hands
They are really hoes. Don't you want a person with integrity
Setting goals, tailored for success, you can measure me
On my accolades and my skill in the field of rhyme
Future so bright, man, for real, have you feeling blind
Plottin' chart toppin while I chill and I'm killin' time
Skills gettin' better but they still ain't as ill as mine
Don't take my word here's some references to check up with
You can call the Gods, UAU is who they represent
Holla at Odd, he made the beat the I mettle wit'
Or Tone & PackFM because my famm is extended trick
Call my peeps Marcus D if you want that better shit
Me & my brethren stick together like a pair of tits
Call Kool Herc & Busy Bee, I ain't arrogant
But here's a quick reminder just in case it still ain't evident, yo!

[Hook][Hook - Maimouna Youssef]
I think I'm in a maze
I feel I'm conflicting within my brain
All these contradictions got me feeling strange
Is this the phase
Or is this the way?

[Verse 1]
I wanna make nonstop profit
I wanna make a non-profit
Close down a store when I go shopping
Open up the floor for a closed topic
And relax on a beach in remote tropics
But grind like I'm broke and I'm so jobless
Feeling like it's me against the world- It's the other way around:
We polluting and we won't stop it
I wanna stay at home and play Xbox
But my homies keep on hitting up my inbox
Say it's been a long time since they seen me
So I'm cutting off the T.V and I meet em at the next spot
I think I want a job at an office
I am the epitome of what a boss is
A paycheck every two weeks
Over losing out on sleep for the fear that I go starving
And yet I wanna take more risk
I don't wanna take more losses
Wanna be a better spender but I like the idea of not caring what the cost is
I wanna tell the truth even when it hurts, but when I get it back I'd rather have the blow softened
Wanna pray 5 times a day, am I heading to the mosque?
Prolly not, I don't go often
In the kitchen cooking dinner yeah I made that
Feelin' lazy so I'll prolly order takeout
Better yet I'm really fiending for some Shake Shack
Lookin at the plate like I gotta keep my weight down
In a circle of self worth and judgment
How you match it up gets puzzling
How to know enough is enough when your lust for a much of enough it feels just as real as a something

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I pretend that I listen a lot when people say things I don't really care about
In one ear and it goes out
And you wouldn't even notice that my head was in the cloud
But my inner voice really wanna shout
Quit crying you ain't dying
But I reply with legitimate advice like
"Keep trying they hiring"
But I really wanna tell them that they wasting time
More importantly they wasting mine
That's harsh and I'm not cold
Yeah I'm from the Capitol but I'm not bold
I guess I really am a nice guy
Keep handled that they don't win races
So I wanna be a track star
Laughing at the people tripping on they own laces
That's tasteless and I got style
And I ain't got wings but I got house
And that's why folks wanna pick my brain
I saw the big picture when I picked my frame
But I think most y'all's pretentious
Prolly just surrounded by the egocentric
And that rubbed off, so
I say things that go along with the grain like
Yeah I meant it

[Hook x2]

I think I'm in a maze (in a maze)
I feel like conflicting with inner brain (yeaah)
All these contradictions got me feeling strange (feelin strange)
Is this a phase (Is this a phase)
Or is this the way? (Is this the way)[Verse 1]
You wear the face of strength
The armor of a tank
Keep ya' calm in a bomber's brink
Your eyes are another paint
I seen their true colors through your blinks
Thin out I'm not here to exploit your chinks
More to reinforce 'em,  from the forces sent to see you sink
Stay afloat, and stay a while, and take a break
All you hear is orders barking, brick
And mortar stopping walls and space
What a shame becoming blame of roots, and no escape
Closing gates on fate like all mistakes are born in place
All it takes is pressing forth with form and grace
Forge a bond with more than hate
Meet these words with open arms
And plant your feet the planet shakes

[Hook]
Counterclockwise you're going in
While you make the same mistakes
Counterclockwise you're going in
Eleven, Ten, Nine, Eight
Counterclockwise you're going in
Seven, Six, Five, Four
Counterclockwise you're going in
Three, Two, One, Twelve-, Time

[Verse 2]
Let me in, let me closer
Let me hold on to what you can’t composure
I’m no pushover, more like a boulder
Or come test me and rest on my shoulders
I really mean it
I know you’re the meanest to me ‘cause I’ve seen your hold ups
And you don’t know trust, you only know bluffs
This world is so tough
Guess you’re some kind of soldier
Hand on your holster, ready for it and it’s over
You ever pulled the trigger early it hurt me before i get to closure
I won’t beat you to it, i ain’t trying, i ain’t lying
I’m just speaking truths and you’re implying that I’m hiding
I’m the mirror and all you see is you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't really wanna make calls much, don't talk on the phone but
You can hit me on the cordless, in the forefront where I store us
On the tour bus where the beats loud
We can speak now, if you ain't then it's all hush
Quit acting like a loner, try growing up
We were young, when we thought the whole world would disown us
Now we  own up to the spilled milk, and the real help is the go rough
When you show love, and it heal welts, sho 'nuff
You know I got your back-, and that's just speaking facts
So when I keep it real, it's not me you attack
But anger is your drive, and that there ain't my map
If fire's all you have, then water meets your match

[Hook ]

[Reversed]
While you make the same mistakes
Eleven, Ten, Nine, Eight
Seven, Six, Five, Four
Three, Two, One, Twelve
Time[Hook:]

It seems like folks now want it right away
They need to slow it down, and ride the wave
To act out of haste, the price we pay
What's destined 'll come, with slight delay.. slight delay
You do stupid shit when you move too a fast
Take a minute to think, and get ya foot off the gas
Each and everyone wanna have some fun
You're living under the sun, goals we gotta get done

[Verse One: yU]

We're living in a world where..
We stay in first gear
Ain't nobody there, earpiece in they ear
At all times, why.. It should be a crime
They desensitize you & I for a dime
When you see your brotherman
Don't nobody say hi, no more
What for, got a lot going on
Yeah right..
Plus just another red light, sitting still up in traffic, stagnant
Madness
A thin line between not having, and lavish
If I can't earn it, then fuck I'll grab it
Learned it from America, home of the Slaves
Lies legalized if the right price paid, paid
Paid off the sweat you losing.. Blessing or a lesson.. Just an illusion
And we wonder why we're losing
Pause for a second, and let the world keep moving..

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Uptown XO]

Like I'm a diamond, I'm shining y'all
Like I'm a sun, I bring light to y'all
Can you imagine me taking a loss
Retaliate before taking it all
Its been a week, dog.. You taking long
U think I'mma let them escape with our
Dough when I crept on through
Let 'em know I'm a pro, so I couldn't wait two..
More minutes, so niggas know how precious every moment is
Don't delay, build up the momentum
Cuz the block gonna talk if we don't get them
Like Barrack, when I talk.. They all listen
Shhhh... listen to 'em laugh when we keep losing
Keep proving ourself wrong, we cruising
Road to redemption, so we keep moving.. Keep, keep moving

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Oddisee]

Good things come to those who wait, hugh..
I'm trynna escape from, the bottom.. That bass drum
Haste I make from, mistakes done regardless
Gotta take from that waste dump the garbage
Turning treasure endeavors to try to sever me
And cleverly and steadily, heavily making progress
I'm one step ahead of me so
I'll never be slow, never be loafing
I'll never be close to somethin' that I wanted but confronted wit walls
If I ain't climbing, I ain't walking, man its nothing to crawl
More important. Man, its nothing to fall
Cuz a brother's bouncing back like I'm dunking a ball
Resilience is brilliance, trust me
Its real in the field, hit hard.. n*gga, rugby..
Nothing to guard you from the ugly, truth
What u want me to say, take time.. delay..

[Hook]And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?

[Verse One] [Oddisee]:
She practically handed me the ass
That I could care less because she lacked class
The fitting of her dress would of had me at 21
Its funny son
Just a few years older more revealings less appealing
And I'm more into shoulders
And other subtleties
I'm in the house more thus I'm out less
I'm less concerned with rocking fits that ain't out yet
I'm still about fresh
But not my tennis shoes more about my fruit and vegs
I decorate my crib my homie's couchless
That ain't the way I live
At least lately the life of a bachelor seems crazy
I went from cold pizza and old FIFA
To seeing goals scored in person at low bleachers
So lazy the youth in me I use to be
I use to like a one night stand
Now I'm all up in her house like there ain't one nice lamp

[Hook]:
And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?
And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?

[Verse Two] [Toine]:
You see I use to be the backpack school type
Headphones jacked up never on the new hype
Trying to clean my act up
Caught up on my own mind till the past stacked up
Failing every class shit I knew I want to rap
Never thought I could achieve who would I be
Not seeing the thinkers make believers from the make believe
So I had to break up out of this thing and go savage
Trying to tilt the fucking earth off its whole axis
20 years up in the game no practice
So when I turn over or crash there's no madness
No tactics
My hearts my instrumental so the ventricles just carry the sensible
But I'm still cynical
I cheat on revolutions with part time solution
But division ain't confusing I just keep it moving
Not even seeing the illusions
Cause everybody's a pimp seducing the percentage from your units
But your boy Toine never looses

[Hook]:
And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?
And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?

[Verse Three] [Oddisee]:
Longer days shorter nights
Make a beat record it nice
Order rice take away
Curry out the way we say
Me and Toine ain't like the way
Hurry out the game already
Sorta nice not enough
Rap about your paper chase
You gonna meet some niggas that just rap and keep their neighbors safe
Not a bluff kind of tough
DMV done bottled up
I'm gonna make that bottle bust
A lot of niggas carving up
Our art enough odd enough
I don't need to make a place
Smart enough new hustle
Progress the new struggle
Less about your skin color
More about your ends color
Whole worlds turning green and I don't mean recycling
That's why I'm out early queens the dollar bills trifling
Greek riots messing up the euro
Mad at that
Sweeds voted right wing sad at that
In fact damn cause they from a different world
Welcome to a black mans
Obama's in the office now
Look at how they reacting

And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?[Hook:]
I'm tryna do it all
(From now on until the day that I'm gone
I think large cause the Earth is too small
For real I'm)
Tryna do it all
(A blank page is how it all starts off
And rhyme and the blueprint'll get drawn on)
Cause I'm
Tryna do it all
(Just like ??? give it up or we gon' take by force
Because I'm)
Tryna do it all
(Without a pause and I ain't got no choice
But to do better than whenever before)
Because I'm tryna do it all

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I'm trying make the world know me, stack G's, yet be lowkey
Get paper with my brothers like the majors, but we so free
So we sign like we don't speak
I'mma rhyme like I'm tryna save the earth within the time I'm spinnin on it
The way my career is going, I might get to spending on it
Depending on if my minutes longer than 15
I might say a verse and then end the song on a big screen
Picture that from a small town with big dreams
From flying coach to buying coach, I'm in between
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I ride the subway as a car, I'm gettin by
My life is hard
Not all the time although yes I'm ready to die, ain't trying starve
I'm on the grind from poverty to the bottom line
And my barter time concluding only with dollar signs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Uptown XO]
I need change like a dollar for four quarters
I want fame, I can't lie to all my supporters
Pops wasn't around like immigration at the border
Illegal aliens gave me my alias, one saucer
We ate off the same plate, became a part of
Each other, we was moving as one cause one thought could
Change the world, Eric Clapton with the guitar
Could talk in the death but the sun is even a dying star
Had a couple meetings, guess we ain't poppin enough ace
Rappers incriminatin like it's no open and shut case
For no one time waits, me and my primates
Had guns like prom dates, look me in my face
Have you ever seen time stand still?
Ask yourself questions like why does man kill?
But fuck it, cause even Big Daddy Kane was Abel
So I'mma spoil my kids like the fruit Eve gave you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: yU]
Now peep the pattern as we movin on up the ladder
Had a dream of how we beam up, puttin the focus on what matters
Most, damn it, I hope that y'all ain't think that the ???
It would never let up, never, full court press upon the ball
Buildin bridges in this rigid bidness, plus stay on our pivot
Pilin albums with a different stylin
We spit to shift the balance
The District Diamond fill up they mind with the realest of rhymin'
Visions get wide when I apply it, now it's livin inside 'em
Borrowed tomorrow and gave back through my raps, our motto
Gotta let y'all know, so our steps led a path to follow
Yeah, son, bread crumbs, left two steps from the edge
Not scared, feelin prepared, that's for whenever that bread comes
Never loafin with potent, the shop's forever open
Speakers smokin with O shit to crack your windows open
And get to zonin, jonin on whoever want it
We go in on every song that we on because we tryna do it all[Verse: Oddisee]
They told me this ain't where the money at
It's funny that I heard that mess when I was coming back
From another sale they tell me I ain't buzzin' welp
Last year I made well over a hundred stacks
I'm sure it's better to know than to show
But it's hard to stay humble in the jungle as a alpha male
Too much romance and not enough real
Maybe that's just how I feel about the program
The old soul meets the old man
On the the road less traveled
They been waitin for a conversation
The wait is over, they catchin' up
Back it up, had enough, taking over ....
That's it right there
Naw it was just twelve bars
Naw, that was it cut it right there[Intro]
I ain't a singer, y'all, I just rap a lot

[Hook]
Bet that when them hoes come
Bet that when them hoes come
They fill up the room
Fill up the room
Bet that when them hoes come
Bet that when them hoes come
They fill up the room
Fill up the room, feel like it's June
Cause we hot
Girl, you know we hot
Show me where the weed at
Show me where them trees at

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know we hot, on fire
Got that weed, let me get my lighter
Cause I'm blazing
(Ooh, you know I'm blazing)
And I know it's late, but we ain't tired
Guess I'll sleep when we retire
And I made it
(Girl, you know I made it)

[Pre-Hook]
I ain't trying to fuss, I just wanna chill and
Get them dollar bills, yeah, get them dollar bills, yeah
I ain't trying to fuss, I just wanna chill and
Get them dollar bills, yeah, get them dollar bills, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know we ain't no lames
And that bass gon' bang
When we play it
(Ooh, it's so amazin')
And her body's off the chain
So you know a nigga trying to get that brain
I can't take it
(You know I can't take it)

[Pre-Hook & Hook][Chorus]
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye with your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye
With your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye
With your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt to let it shine

[Verse 1]
Fork in road, one is chose, least i drove
Nothing's easy what's a freebie?
All is sold we been reaping
In the fold, in the creases where I stole
Lucky see me, see my lows
Only highs I meant to show like all I meant to be is so
[?] close to being exposed
Can't have that so guard your secrets there the weakness to your foes
Catch you slipping on the slope, your positions in their scope
Take a hit and keep on ticking quick decision bleed to glow
Freeze the gold, no need to know the answer for all reasons seem to go
This ain't rocket science just have hardened mind beat them both
Over thinking overboard, soaked and sinking close to shore
Could have made a fear of failure sings the forward [?]
On the [?] the king to cost the Queen to cost him a loss
Hindsight is stronger, believe that if he back at dawn
Without the help of warnings your mornings repeat like alarms
You know the answer quit dancing around it an get dressed for prom

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I feel it more than ever you know
The Inevitably inevitable
It's better to leave than never to know
Who better than me to tell me to go
But the best is yet to come, will I regret this after run
Leave the next one next to none on a quest to manifest the [?] sun
I don't know but I'm cool with that
Foolish perhaps to choose this or that, or nothing at all
This could build while that collapse and I stood on stilts now fit to fall
So why make a move like, pushes sort of rude like
I'm that sort of dude that wants it all to prove that it ain't all a view like
Yo, Running in circles and waiting in lines
Jumping the hurdles we make in our minds
I'ma just go with the flow and I hope when it's over I'm over and made it in time
Know in the moment the open and closing the road and roses of war before
The battle was held, neglected to tell, went for the second I reckon I failed

[Chorus]
