[Verse 1]

Yo, I changed my habitat to palm trees from tabernac
Now I’m pullin' playboy bunnies just like a rabbit trap
White boy, looking like an angry tatted cabbage patch
That flies economy, but Lola’s got a Gucci travelbag!
Lone ranger, back on the saddle with satin saddlebags
And two chrome platinum battleaxe is the cattle brand
I don’t battlerap as I shadowcast
Attack a pack of cackling jackals to watch them scatter fast!
I got a new girl, who knows how long that’ll last?
Wants me to tie her up, I said I have to put the paddle back
Master of the universe, He-man, I’m back on battlecat
Mad’ll rap — circles around these rappers, hold your bladder back!
I sabotage and camouflage and cause an avalanche
So call an ambulance, while this track keep playin a mandolin
Scrambling these words together, no one fucks with fancy pants
I’m vain as fuck, can't walk by a mirror without a handsome glance!

[Hook]
I’m a sick and twisted midget with invisible friends
I cut like scissors with precision while you’re miserably vent
I mutilate the master, leave them physically dead
Some rappers run away from me like I’m a biblical plague
Sometimes I paint my face like juggalos and twisted sister
Eleven on the richtor, sick-o, I’m a triple twister
What comes around, goes around Ill close you down clown
Lyrics they keep circling your head, like Bose surround sound!

[Verse 2]

Okay, remain sober, insane cobra, the evil green dragon
Pain’s over, white range rover, the silver G wagon
I watch for new popular acts like I got binoculars
Cause one day, my shit is gonna end like the apocalypse!
But ‘til then, rapper fuck around he’s getting stamped out
Devil ain’t just knocking on my door, he’s fucking camped out!
Would someone please tell Lucifer I’m back to being a recluse again?
Every night I pray to God with Jesus on the crucifix!
And I don’t want no problems, but the little Goblin’s gone legit
No disrespect, but following your path, my life is gone to shit!
And even though I’m dope, this barrel is full of coke and heroine
I’m happy being clean and flying straighter than an arrow is!
The devil’s laughing, while these rappers buy his hollow dreams
Me? I’m down with juggalos, paint our faces like Halloween!
Cellar dweller, you're Helen Keller, I am Skeletor
My juggernaut gone in 60 seconds like an Eleanor!

[Hook]
I’m a sick and twisted midget with invisible friends
I cut like scissors with precision while you’re miserably vent
I mutilate the master, leave them physically dead
Some rappers run away from me like I’m a biblical plague
Sometimes I paint my face like juggalos and twisted sister
Eleven on the richtor, sick-o, I’m a triple twister
What comes around, goes around Ill close you down clown
Lyrics they keep circling your head, like Bose surround sound!

[Verse 3]

Ayo I’m doper than a barrel in a boat
Full of heroin and coke
Still I’m straighter than an arrow in a bow!
My style’s beautiful like Marilyn Monroe
But I’m more like Charlie Manson, when I’m tearin out your throat!
Once you get a buzz, if you lose it, it’s hard to get it back
So I’m working seven days a week while tryin to keep my head intact
So many rappers now, don’t matter if you’re twice as dope
Tryna' ride a rusty bicycle back up an icy slope!
But due to due diligence the new villain of dooms not through killing it
Dude, I’m to militant
When I get in the zone, I’m an abstract evil poet
And I’m still yet to have my time, I think the people know it!
I’m in the Barker Lounge coming up with a darker sound
Hellhounds, and demons in my head, my dogs are barking now!
It’s fun to be spoke out and leave the ego out of it
Hit the kids with love, cause that’ll beat the evil out of'em
Backpack rapper, I am underground, it’s pretty basic
Just get a pad and pen and smokes and find a dirty basement
Little devil, I rap for angels with dirty faces
They come from hurting places, feeling when I’m burning statements!

[Hook]
I’m a sick and twisted midget with invisible friends
I cut like scissors with precision while you’re miserably vent
I mutilate the master, leave them physically dead
Some rappers run away from me like I’m a biblical plague
Sometimes I paint my face like juggalos and twisted sister
Eleven on the richtor, sick-o, I’m a triple twister
What comes around, goes around Ill close you down clown
Lyrics they keep circling your head, like Bose surround sound![Verse 1: Demrick]
I'm always searching for the setup
Mother told her son "Boy better never let up"
I’ve been fed up, keep your head up, I'mma do this shit forever
Close my eyes watch letters come together
Better than whoever died
They better never not, murk 'em on the spots
Swervin' on some shots
Puffin' pot, this ain’t what you want
On the block, talk a lot, parking lot, barber shop
So I’m in the studio groovin' in the ambiance
Try and be a Capitan, think you’ll be a happy man
Trash can competitions, send them in an ambulance
Taliban, contraband, bitch do the molly dance
Make it out without a chance, livin down at Zombieland
My mind is all twisted, I need a smoke
They hope, I go over the edge without a vote
But nope, these quotes have overcome the impossible
Don't think that they ain't watching you
Nobody's safe

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

Yeah, it ain’t safe nigga (Nah)
Jarren Benton

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
My pen is poisonous, secrete on your girlfriend’s orifice
Politic with God, said make love to a sorceress
Twist kush like a contortionist
Skimming through thesauruses to find the perfect synonym to slaughter shit
Yeah, I’ve been tryna make a dollar, Dear
Fucking four bitches for perc and petting koala bears
I'm Alfred Hitchcock on PCP
Spillin' vodka for my nigga restin' 6 feet deep
I’m a legend in the making, these other rappers are bacon bits
Too much time in the music, fuck up relationships
Bitch breathe, got chloroform on a handkerchief
Be standing ovation, I spoke at the player's banquet
Fuck wit' me cause you stuck wit' me
I give a shit about your 2 cents nigga, here catch a buck fifty
Underneath the bubble goose, a tool that’ll cut kidneys
We in this motherfucker styrofoam cup with me

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

[Verse 3: Madchild]
Aye, Underground Kings, swing swords like we Turkish
The worst version of personal verse murkers
Spookiest nucliest kookiest conquest
So nobody's safe like a nuclear bomb threat
Young De dabbed till his lungs full of crystals
We kung fu fist, all these young tongue twisters
Very mental , listen and say "The Demented"
Kill it on a hoppa instrumental, now with Jarren Benton
Aye, I am asshole smurf
Money spread across the floor like it's AstroTurf
I met a groupie, almost had a heart attack
Fucked her then I came in her face and called it an autograph
Told you that right after I nut I won't call you
West coast Bax-War killers with Funk Volume
Angry, I'm bady, a Gladiator mayne
We are hungry, salivate with alligator fangs
I'm from an asylum, wild tribal and violent
Won’t catch me sleeping, I sliced both of my eyelids
I'm vibrant , vampire and lycan, a hybrid
White like i'm Rye bread and write like a tyrant

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe[Verse 1]
I broke my piggy bank and haven't put it back together
Back in heaven blastin' rounds like I'm a MAC-11
Livin' in my rainy city it was all wrong
Used to be the big fish in a small pond
Now I'm swimming with the sharks but I'm a down piranha
Plus I'm moving Fast & Furious like Brian O'Conner
Rest in peace, a restless beast
Call me Mighty Mouse, pocket's full of extra cheese, yup
Still a mental savage that is ravenous, indeed
Exerting psycho babble from a labyrinth in me
Angels flying up above, demons down beneath
When I'm breathing you can hear the evil seeping through my teeth
Close friends worth more than cash and havin' wealth
Self destructive beings are a hazard to themself
Lion roars, stronger than an iron door
Sun has killed the rain, love has killed the pain that I endure

[Hook]
Half these rappers are the liars like Pinocchio
10% are dope, other 90 less than okey-doke
You don't wanna rope-a-dope with Mad, you get the broken nose
Small but when I'm rappin' I am taller than the Poconos
My soul is mischievous like A-Plus and Opio
A toy collector, plus my clothes, they come from Tokyo
I'm not sayin' I got the dopest flow
But kids are studyin' my methods like a vocal coach

[Verse 2]
My brain's a battlefield for devils and angels
Walkin' contradiction like machetes and rainbows
Burdeon on my shoulders that is heavy and painful
Shane's raw, tearin' shit like Eminem's chainsaw
Battle Mad and you could be in real danger
Excruciating training like a Navy SEAL ranger
Run for cover, bounty hunter like I'm Bobafett
Wild west bounty hunter like I'm Jonah Hex
Ay, bitch, I could talk to the dead
You connect with me cause I can read the thoughts in your head
Yeah, mentally projecting till I'm causing metamorph(os)is
Almost lost my head like the fucking headless horsemen
Holdin' a jack-o-lantern, acrobatic verbiage
Dirtiest of wordsmiths, bar game is murderous
Don't talk about it much but came up with true killers
Still here cause I'm unbreakable like Bruce Willis

[Hook]
Half these rappers out are liars like Pinocchio
10% are dope, other 90 less than okey-doke
You don't wanna rope-a-dope with Mad, you get the broken nose
Small but when I'm rappin' I am taller than the Poconos
My soul is mischievous like A-Plus and Opio
A toy collector plus my clothes, they come from Tokyo
I'm not sayin' I got the dopest flow
But kids just studyin' my methods like a vocal coach[Куплет 1: Oxxxymiron]
Сомнения слетаются с утра
Моя бритая башка – это их Лысая гора
Сколько ещё лет будет мясо и рубилово?
И сколько ещё куплетов про себя любимого?
Я здоров, как бык, но смертельно болен
Ведь от священных коров отвык
Ильдабаоф, он же Иегова, он же Князь мира сего
Суёт перо в кадык
За окном под видом города гниёт нарыв
Я режу вас турбиною во снах
Не реже, чем под Аль-Джазиру мастурбирую на снафф
Желаю смерти пары редколлегий, пары рэп-коллег
И я не Дейл Карнеги, мне всё это на руку, как Брейгель
Мне снится то глава Ампира «В»
То в эфире ТВ живая голова Эльвиры Т
У меня кризис жанра!
Не Индиана, но всё из последних сил
Как прыжок в дилижанс из дирижабля
Что? Слышь, ногами на коврик!
Якобы, ты говорил, что я сдулся?
Но, видимо я ипохондрик
Если держу свою руку на пульсе
И в этом году я смогу либо переродиться
Либо загнусь от конвульсий
Ведь на хуй жить, если новой не сложить песни?
И к чему вычурная полисиллабика
Коль из нового ничего, летит моль из динамиков?
Мой второй альбом
Будет эталон, либо в этанол с головой!
Ты говно, либо гений – среднего не дано!

[Припев: Oxxxymiron]
А! Твоя мигрень – балаган!
Тут больше четверти века набекрень голова!
Мы идём на глубине путями тёмными
Под веществами ещё не изобретёнными![Hook]
Yo I’m going Prefontaine on you hoes
Mad dope like putting cocaine up your nose yeah
Those that oppose get slain I suppose yeah
Mad Child spit acid rain on you hoes
Gladiator on the battle break
You’re better off french-kissing with a rattlesnake
Fuck with Mad Child, that’ll be a bad mistake
Tell me how much torture can a little fucking savage take

[Verse 1]
I’ll go fishing and I catch a fucking rapper like a manta ray
Then slice his motherfucking throat with a katana blade
Rappers bugging me, I turn into a can of Raid
You are not a candidate, eat you like a candy cane
Veins are full of antifreeze, call me Candy Man
Three times, holding tools like I’m a fucking handyman
Rhymes are sweet, get delivered like a candy-gram
Fuck these pussy rappers up like porno on a handycam
I’m the Lawnmower Man, powerfully electric with an ongoing plan
I was crazy now a calm lowly man, yeah right, I’m a lunatic with bombs blowing land

[Hook]
I’m going Prefontaine on you hoes
Mad dope like putting cocaine up your nose yeah
Those that oppose get slain I suppose yeah
Mad Child spit acid rain on you hoes

Gladiator on the battle break
You’re better off french-kissing with a rattlesnake
Fuck with Mad Child, that’ll be a bad mistake
Tell me how much torture can a little fucking savage take

[Verse 2]
Won’t hear me complain, I am free from pain
I am running fucking shit like Prefontaine
Words spreading like they’re viral, now watch them spiral
Right into your brain until they break right through your firewall
You can see the fire in my eyeballs scaring all my rivals
Straightedge bitch, fuck a highball
You get kiboshed, I’m a cyborg
I’m a cyclops, I’m a rhyme lord
I don’t mind cops just as long as they’re cool
? find props mystical a werewolf
Spitting like I’ve written everyday since I have been born
Rocking diamond clothing, buying furniture from Inform

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Very charismatic addict, I’m a ruined idol
Last year even my demo sounded suicidal
This year spitting venom I’m a subhuman
Walking down the street I hear my song in cars with subs booming
Regurgitating rhymes like I am gargling
Everybody knows that I am dope, there is no arguing
Spitting sparklers, no rappers targeting
Don’t have to cause I marvellously raps like I am carpeting
I drink Monster, I rock Diamond
I rock RDS, I love rhyming
I cause problems, they know I’m raising hell
Now I got em worried like Carlito on the Jezebel

[Hook][Verse 1: Madchild]

I'm hiding in the shadow from the demons that I battle
I'm a psycho with a hypodermic needle in my ankle
My cerebral has a fire breathing ego that exists
I'm evil, people lock my sights and burn you to a crisp
My sentiments are venomous, I'm poisonous to enemies
No cure, there is no remedy -- death will be the penalty
I'm menacing, inventive with demented thoughts of grandeur
Temper is explosive, I'm a boiling pot of anger
Middle-aged mutant, deformed monstrosity
Do not have the audacity to fuck with this atrocity
Reform, deform, creeper in a tree fort
Deport, back into my country, read the report
Igor.. "why dey wanna pick on little me for?"
C4 explosives, I'm ferocious by the seashore
Keep it, you will reap it, I will give it all I got
I'm strategic, devil's reject, I will think then I will plot (Blah!)

[Verse 2: Madchild]

I will have the last laugh, I'm a fuckin' bad man
Surround my house with sand bags, like in fuckin' Bahgdad
They don't feel the fire yet? They will feel the back draft
Hand makin' bullets when I'm listenin' to Black Flags
Selectors, they are sodomized, detecting me on satellite
Sneak across the border to Seattle with a pad and mic
DJ play a battle break, I'm battling on stage
I'm a rattle snake, you kids should not be rattling my cage
And I don't give a fuck about a rapper with a buzz
I'll happily attack him and extract a little blood
Like packing an exacto, I'm exact with the result
Your friends can ask what happen, you'll say "Crap, it was my fault.."
I'm an albatross, fuckin' falcon claws
Half mountain lion, countless crimes but I'll be fine
My blood is mixed with alkaline
Kill the little monster, he is obviously insane
He's probably just a goblin that has problems with his brain

[Verse 3: Madchild]

I go to bed at night, I'm dreaming of revenge
But I'm tossing and I'm turning, candle burning at both ends
I wake up asking "Don't you hear the laughing?"
They don't hear it
Every night I pray to God, "Protect us from these evil spirits."
Lyrics like I'm touched by the angels; I'm dangerous
Put my words together in the strangest arrangements
I'm blooming from my vanity; illuminate insanity
Accumulating doom related lines that leave you panicking
A samurai; I guess I glamorize being traumatized
Promise I will never compromise with these homicides
An alligator salivating, calibrating jaws
Rap of malady I'll gravitate to gladiator dogs
Divine separatist, rhyme defined specimen
Combine efforts, align sublime specialist
I design, refine lines is my weaponry
Trying to find destiny, God provides recipe[Intro]
Fuck this economy
Cigarettes and red bull

[Verse 1]
I am the provider with the spider and the Viking
And on the typewriter, I am divider of the titans
Faster than a motorbike and brighter than a bolt of lightning
Tight is when I hold the mic explode and show the world excitement
Totally enlightened and walking on a different path
When I hit a verse it's like a fucking car collision crash
The rate of rebuilding my life, it isn't fast
I don't care how rich I get, I'm never flying business class
Put me in economy; I don't care who you bunch of stars
Like it's astronomy and I am an anomaly
The type of verses that I spit could be a real problem
Ill goblin climbing up the hill, hobbling
Still squabbling; unidentified flying object
They wondering whats inside my closet
Little, green martians and Sci-Fi projects
And big, furry monsters with eyes like targets
Carcass with a parka wearing a motorcycle helmet
Help me: I'm a psycho with a knife and mental illness
Give me a gun; I am troublesome
Cause I'm quick to pop a rapper like he's bubble gum

[Hook]
I got drugs in my pocket and I don't know what to do with them
Drugs in my pocket
I got drugs in my pocket and I don't know what to do with them
Drugs in my pocket, drugs in my pocket
He put drugs in my pocket, man, I thought that I was through with them
Yeah, drugs in my pocket
I got drugs in my pocket and I don't know what to do with them
Drugs in my pocket, drugs in my pocket

[Verse 2]
Got a red under my bed
There's a little, yellow man in my head
I'm a bipolar polar bear zipping up a polar fleece
Drinking Polar Ice and Pepsi Cola on a coral reef
Every lyric that I spit is an oral feat
Elbows on my knees, head in hands thinking 'poor, old me'
I keep a strap tucked; at least a sharp blade
Cause kids be playing more games than an arcade
And I am not afraid: I will shoot you dead
There's more snakes in this club than Medusa's head
I'm still underground: call me Tomb Raider
While I rap with iron jaws like Moonraker
You keep lying while you tell the kids your cool fables
I'll chop your fucking head off and leave it on the pool table
I'm not too stable: I am off my rocker
I'll lift you while making noises like I was Chewbacca
I'm fucking dope, like I could cook the rock up
He's a malacka and I'm down to knock his fucking block off
So thank-you, Mr. Ron Cavanaugh
My friend's in jail for more keys than a grand piano
When I say I'm hot, that means that I'm too hot to handle
If I don't make it in rap, to Willie Nelson: I can rock a banjo

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got a .38 special in the pocket of my hoodie
While I shake my pill bottle see if I still got some goodies
Give me a gun: I am troublesome
Quick to pop a fucking rapper like he's bubble gum
I swear I'll stab him with a sharpened lead pencil
Cause rappers, they got great, big heads like Fred Flintstone
I'm Michael Myers with a pair of pliers
First I'll eat your eyes and then I'll set your hair on fire
Now call me Jason with a hockey mask
Midlife crisis and I'm still a little, cocky brat
I'm tired of all these copycats
I need some help: I've never felt this fucked
Cause I had everything and then I had to self-destruct
Now I've got nothing but I swear that I am not complaining
Signing out from Canada: Van' city where it's always raining[Verse 1]
Rappers talking shit, that's a slaughter call
Slice his neck, blood flowing like a waterfall
I'm a sexy fucking beast, hope your daughter's home
I'm a modern gnome spitting out a lot of poems
You want to hear the fucking best? 'Kay, you got it, holmes
I don't like to sit and rot at home, watch this Rottie foam
Foaming at the mouth, roaming through the South
Kill it in the North, kill it in your house
Doesn't really matter where I'm at - white tarantula
My name is spreading all around, got a spatula?
Little guy but my aura is gargantuan
People stop in cars and tell me, "Mad Child, you're a champion"
I say thank you very much, take a quick photo
Don't like my shit? You can suck my fucking dick, dodo
Said I rise like a phoenix
Clean that fucking shit out of your ears, get a Kleenex

[Hook]
I'm happy to be back on stage
I don't wanna, I don't wanna act my age
I'm just repping that I rap all day
Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna act my age
Getting girls, I just laugh all day
Making money, make this rap game pay
Man, I'm happy to be back on stage
Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna act my age

[Verse 2]
You? You're like Fozzie the Bear and you got bad habits
Me? I'm Ozzy Osbourne in fuckin' Black Sabbath
Little Monster, I'm a track savage
Me and my team, we all break bread and crack cabbage
Travel 'round the world like gypsies and pirates
More like little Alex with a little Ultraviolence
Doing shows, I'm a real Rock-n-Rolla
Hit the telly drunk and go for walks and talk to Lola
Picking up these bitches that are half my age
Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna act my age
Friends with all my enemies, walk among identi-thieves
Borderline insanity and rapping is my remedy
Mentally I'm battling myself, I need a sedative
For real, this shit is like Alien versus Predator
I'll eat these rappers like a fucking bag of Cheesies
I'm colder than a bag of Freezies

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Don't worry about my age. You should worry about my rage
How I jump onto a stage like I just broke out the cage
Fifteen years ago, crazy little rapping hobo
Up shit's creek without a paddle in a plastic rowboat
I'm venting with constant tension
Beyond comprehension, a wanted henchman
I'm an old creep giving you the heebie-jeebies
Punk rock like it's '86 and I'm at CBGB's
Slice your face with an X-Acto blade
My friends are saying, "Time for you to act your age"
Naw, that's ok. I just want to sit around and rap all day
I just sit around and laugh all day, making racks off these tracks like it's crack cocaine

[Hook]Intro- Mad Child
Yeah... And you don't stop... Shit is crazy...
Everybody got their tool sharpened up man..
Prev One man kill'em...

[Prevail]
Oral speech, coral reef, beach submariner
Orbital bone gets cracked up with the chrome like the Punisher
The microphone transponder, transporter galvatron
Transformer galvanized, oversized pecking order
Fourth quarter Hail Mary, Prevail wins the game again
Westerly winds rip up your sails till they're paper thin
Pirate ship, private stock, power plant
Douse the light house watch as vessel crash into the rocks
Man over board, S.O.S., sharks in the open water
Battle Axe alumni buddy, oh that's my Alma Mater
Northwest villain, Mount St Helen's, overflowin' lava
Overgrown jungles cover monuments from ancient times
X and Y chromosomes are known to metamorphosize
Alpha beta carotene, kerosine, alkaline
Genetic alphabetic prime, kinetic algorithmic times ten
I use my mind to make time and space bend my friend, yeah

[Hook: Mad Child]
Almost famous, now I wonder if they've heard of us
Together we are one, when I'm alone I'm just a third of us
Family bond that's even deeper than blood
Cause we choose to stick together while we creep through the mud
And walk through the fire, we've been to heaven and hell
But when we were at the bottom, fuck it, nobody bailed
That's why we got a bond that's even deeper than blood
Cause we choose to stick together while we creep through the mud

[Mad Child]
I'm a reaper with a sickle
A twisted little sick-o, I'm as vicious as a pitbull
Eating gun powder, rottie with a shottie and a snotnose
A lot goes on while I watch my partner's locks grow
Canadian, together we are bigfoot and sasquach
Psycho killer with a hockey mask that's the mascot
Blood drips from the machete, it's a clean kill
I believed in us back then, I believe still
Skulls wash up to the seashore from the ocean
Meeting of the minds we should be more ferocious
Need more commotion, yeah, record, C4
Explosives, yeah, eat more, deport emotion
Prev and me together spit the lyrics that can paralyze
Together we become a pack of wolves that fucking terrorize
Strategic cold calculated killer under black skies
Mixed with orange and burgundy, we perform a surgery
When we break into Rob the Viking beats like it's a burglary
Reflection looking back at me, I think it want to murder me
Almost Famous now I wonder if they've heard of us
Together we are one when I'm alone I'm just a third of us

[Hook]
Almost famous, Now I wonder if they've heard of us
Together we are one, when Im alone im just a third of us
Family, bond that's even deeper than blood
Because we choose to stick together while we creep through the mud

[Prevail]
Alright, my battle axe cavalcade will turn your brain to marmalade
Armored car, bar spittin', hard hittin' gamma rays
Nowadays a phase can graze and ooze just like an oil painting
Boiler room money making, some are taken by surprise
Poisonous to cyanide, surprised I can not take a life?
Break the hive and watch the hornets sting and swarm with killer form
Fall free, you fuck with one of us, you fuck with all three
Freestyle cypher life, you know what they call me
Predator king of the jungle, second part was concrete
Levitate, decapitate, reactivate the alpha team
Sith Lord Palpatine, next step dominance
Prevail from the ominous province of steady rain fall
Deadlier than Darth Maul, heavier than the Death Star
This beautiful death machine is nitrous, with full bars
Flat black paint with glossy black skull
So we still kill copy cats who copy what we do, yeah

[Hook]
Almost famous, now I wonder if they've heard of us
Together we are one, when I'm alone it's just a third of us
It's family, a bond that's even deeper than blood
Cause we choose to stick together while we creep through the mud
And walk through the fire, we've been to heaven and hell
But when we were at the bottom, fuck it, nobody bailed
That's why we got a bond that's even deeper than blood
Cause we chose to stick together while we creep through the mud[Intro] [Evidence]:
Both middle fingers up, point 'em at the industry

[Verse One: Mad Child]
Watch a misguided angel bust
Like I'm on red devil angel dust
Man I play off the pain
Bear witness to the chaos that reigns
Of course I'm insane
Of course I'm gonna course through your veins
I'm a beast, you can't get rid of my name
Spit lit propane
Dope fiends, this is cooked cocaine
While I'm tryin' to touch these kids like Kurt Cobain
I guess that's why I fuck with pills that could hurt your brain
Chop through the track
Talk like I walk with an axe
Confident rap, no argument, I conquer with that
King Kong stomp through the track
Armed to attack
Come see the concert, I'm a monster with that
Faceless one
Patience till it's done
Shine bright, Shane could change places with the sun
Little savage in the states, I'm gettin' gradually known
The poet king is finally back on his throne
I'm glad to be home

[Hook: Evidence] {x2}
Man, we got this
Locked, kept under wraps
The best kept secret leakin' through the crack
Man, we so close
We stay lookin' for traps
And try to stay separate from these cats
It's Battleaxe
Man, we got this
Locked, kept under wraps
The best kept secret all across the map
Man, we so close
We stay lookin' for traps
And try to stay separate from these cats
It's Battleaxe

[Verse Two: Iriscience]:
Yo, kids try to kick it like it's A.Y.S.O
I'm World Cup, Copa Mundial, so let's go
Catch me killin' clubs or rippin' shows al fresco
Right in front of the bar like Pablo Esco
I'm a narcotic fiends go for the dope
I learned to secure position then go for the choke
I used to have a handle on life but it broke
Now I'm ghostriding Amsterdam flights for the smoke
Still you know my work ethic is strictly 'get busy'
They think I'm a teddy bear until it gets grizzly/gristly
Rappers wantin' beef, leave 'em in a meat locker
Fly around the world, line around the block to see Raaka
Money talks, sings and raps
Dilated out for more titles, rings and plaques
Sounds classic, like Chuck D and Cadillacs
While my Vancouver cats keep swingin' a Battleaxe

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Bishop Lamont]
Yeah, Battleaxe like Golden Axe
Gilius Thunderhead, dwarf competition
You're all hobbits to my optics
I'm talkin' microscopic, termite dandruff
And it's from my vantage
Better vanish 'fore I open fire with these cannons, somethin' mammoth
Flow like that Flying Dutchman
Best who did it, done it, do it
Nigga no need for discussion
Kick hits, split yo shit just like I was Zohan
You niggas bitch, pussy shit, stealin' shit so I guess that makes you Lohan
Get ate like ??, niggas you are not that poppin'
Slightly carbonated, pop your top, your fizz is quickly stoppin'
Parkinson's Disease in a Delorean, forever rockin'
And when I roll nigga, I lean so cool like Steve Hawkins (Battleaxe)
Nigga I got this like uh
I'mma pay the tab
I got this like, "Whoa, back up little homie, I'mma beat his ass"
Steppin' with my weapon, reppin' westside man
While real niggas don't fuck with 'Pac holograms

[Verse Four: D-Sisive]
I sit alone in my four cornered room
Wick burnin' till the wax drips, torchin' a spoon
Feelin' nervous while The Clash spins
Joe Strummer fought the law pickin' at strings
And we'd rather bail/Bale then spread our Batwings
Dark Knight, off light, Corey Hart, seein' dark all night
Time to let my battleaxe swing
Despite all my rage, I'm a rat in a cage
With a plan to escape out the basement
Walk through the fog
Grapefruit balls in my drawers
I'm a Hobo With A Shotgun, whistling a 'Pac song
Shot a cop car with a flurry of Who Got The Props, get it?
Sick so, dope sick, no fix, no spit, so syringe inject slow
The king of rock OD'd
The king of pop OD'd
So what's God got in shop for little ol' me?[Intro]:
It’s all up in my head
Aye, aye
It’s all up in my head
It’s all up in my head

[Verse One]:
I’m from Canada, I’m from Canada
Used to be an addict now I’m cleaner than a janitor
Open up my mouth its rapid fire from a banana clip
Shoot a bunch of manikins, I’m a fucking anarchist
I want a Grammy, our formats the Juno
Americans look at us like we're Borat or Bruno
I don't bathe got cooties still get my kudos
Warlock from Pluto, black belt in Judo
I do a bunch of lines and get a red nose like Rudolf
Watching porno wacking off in front of my computer
Last eight months I’ve been straighter than a ruler
And my medulla oblongata is a barracuda
But it’s a cold world man, colder than a cooler
It’s cold out there man, people have gotten crueler
I’m tryin' to get fat rub my belly like Buddha
And make a million spittin' punchlines like Luda

[Hook]:
I’m going crazy inside my head
The sun is going black and the sky's gone red
Will I wake up in the morning or will I be dead
There is something very wrong with me
I’m going crazy inside my head
The sun is going black and the sky's gone red
Will I wake up in the morning or will I be dead
There is something very wrong with me

[Verse Two]:
I want it all dog, I want it all dog
The money that I make is mine keep your paws off
Under my bed I got a Glocc and it's sawed off
I breathe fire, spit lightning and rap my balls off
Yeah, I am narcissistic
Plus a shark at business
My art is dark and twisted
On the roof I'm getting chased, by two cop vets
Trying to memorize my verse for DjBooth.net
And life is full of pain and death no antidote
Life is fucking hard, I wish this shit came with a manual
I guess that’s why they read the Bible, it's Mr. Suicidal
You wanna live right, do the opposite that I do
Listen this is arson I’m a vicious martian
I leave you sleeping with the fishes it's the headless horseman
I was a friendless orphan, that got offended often
Now I’m a splendid boyfriend making an endless profit

[Hook]

[Verse Three]:
And where I live there ain't nobody that is better than me
So I just rap in front of mirrors, my competitor's me
Now I’m battling myself, battling myself
I will kill you they will dissect your anatomy in hell
Assault Battery, my batteries are recharged
I'll kill your whole fucking album, with three bars
Yo that stupid customs officer's a retard
I need to get back in the States, with the green card
Skin kind of oily, my blood start boiling
I send you across the table lying flatter than a doily
Lucky like a four leaf clover super Grover flying down and
Punching out a ruthless group of stupid ogres
Imagine if Jughead and Veronica
Were listening to Jay Electronica while Reggie rolled the chronic up
Always stay on my guard wishing on a falling star
Walking down the street look like I'm 'bout to rob an armored car
I keep my lid low, I keep my brow frowned
Looking at the gas attendant like you better bow down
I’m a Boondock Saint wearing tube socks a new glocc
And 2Pac playin[Intro]
Now they call him the king of pain
When’s my second chance coming?

[Verse 1]
Go fuck yourself, pardon my French immersion
Going back in time like the Prince of Persia
So broke I’mma start pinching purses
Snatching watches, lifting your wallet
Wanted to be big like Christopher Wallace
Now I got this pig saying this is your calling
Customs treat me like a terrorist
Banned from America, I need a therapist
Possessor of the sacred sword, pulled blade from stone
Now the sounds of madness invade your home
Used to sleep on the cardboard box
Now the warlock door lock like Fort Knox
Hardcore thoughts in my art form shocks
You shouldn’t shadow box with the Grim Reaper
Now I grip my battle axe and I think deeper
Treating my life like blood-thirsty creature
Look like a gremlin with much better features
Call him Thor with the war hammer special
Six Red Bulls, four more canned espressos

[Hook]
War angel now the lone ranger
Hi ho Silver, the world’s in danger
Win some, lose some, used to be considered handsome
Now I’m ugly as sin, Black Phantom

[Verse 2]
Man becomes legend, legend becomes myth
Myth becomes failure, that becomes gift
I don’t give a fuck about the money that you’re counting
I’m going deep into the tunnel of the mountain
Spiritually awakened, that’s where it’s safest
Cause if I really want what you have I’ll just take it
But I am no longer listening to Satan
Your pockets are full but your soul it is vacant
Once a family, now four strangers
Reach insanity, now I’m more dangerous
Backs start to turn on the lone ranger
A lot less visits for the war angel
Did more than my share as far as cocaine go
And I still erupt like a volcano
My head’s still spinning, human tornado
Still dying as I’m staring at a black rainbow
Fuck everyone, fuck everything
Joke’s on me, I was never king
Walked around like I could never do wrong
Lost everything, now everything’s gone

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, ok, yo, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look, I’m a beast, I’m a vet, I’m a stone cold survivor
Got so many stripes, man, I look like a tiger
I pulled so many rappers’ cards, call me Hallmark
Racks, I got stacks, I am racked up like Walmart
Man I’m disgusting like old chunky yogurt
I’m old but I’m still fucking cool, Humphrey Bogart
Crash course kids, seatbelts and roll bars
Breaking into beats like I am carrying a crowbar
Five gold stars. I’m a terminator
Determined, not a German, permanent exterminator
24 bars, that’s a baker’s dozen
I am bad man like getting naked with your cousins
Brand you can trust, I’m dependable too
I’m getting old but still a killer boy, Expendables 2
Don’t mean to hurt your feelings boy but I will
Cuz I'm on top again and you can’t even get to the hill
Yeah, super beast, I'm an immortal, let me demonstrate
My skin is bulletproof impossible to penetrate
An animal that stands lateral without collateral
My personalities are multiple but they’re compatible

[Hook]
I can make an album in a week
Still be flyer than a motherfucking falcon with a beak
Let me do a show, I guarantee I'll pack ‘em in their seats
Cus I’m a fucking super beast, my homies back me in the street
Yo, I'm not a lil’ bitch, I'm not a bastard or a thief
I pray to god at night and thank him for my life, that’s my belief
I'm ok as long as all the bills are paid and I am dry
Got a little whip that cracks, my clothes are fresh, my girl is fly, fly, fly

[Verse 2]
I’ll race you, fuck, boy, that’s that shit I don’t like
You talking shit because my skin color is bone white
2 A.M. I am rapping on a cold mic
Just because I’m barking please do not think that I don’t bite
I’m a complex bomb threat
Little King Kong, I’m a broken Vietnam vet
My story dark so I go deeper than a tar pit
Put you in a chokehold, your nose is in my armpit
Nighty night, go to sleep from my Jiu jitsu
It's dark and I’m a shark, this is my turf and you are fish food
Sick and deranged cannibal, twisted and strange animal
I an insane man and my vision’s to rain cannonballs
I’m the last emperor in the Forbidden City
I will take over the planet when I’m good and ready
Deranged orphan, I’m sick of all the horse shit
Hire me for a verse and I will murder you on your shit

[Hook][Intro: Slaine]
Tell them motherfuckers to shut the fuck up in the background!
There's a new song and dance going on!

[Verse 1: Slaine]
Up in the MGM Grand with 10 g's in his hand
Coked out, drinkin', thinkin' of the reasons he’s planned
For shit to get hot as the summer til it’s freezin' again
Bullets pop off, hit you like it’s grease from the pan
Man, he don’t he believe in the law
Is it all regards? Demons 'n lords
Stackin' the paper, schemin' the broads
Whats his name, is it Steven or George?
Half of the time, that’s where the crime is
Kids, he’s been involved
Scare bids, even it off
Divas got his evening revolving
Not even the problem, the meanest of all
But the semen's evolved to get his penis and balls in
Lisa and all, who’s a piece of shit whore
With some creaks in her jaw that squeaks like a dolphin
He don’t even do drugs, he’s getting off em
He crashes into a wall, crawls in the coffin

[Hook: Slaine]x2
Bobby Be Real, (Bobby Be Real)
They told him "Bobby Be Real" (Bobby Be Real)
They said life isn't easy
Keep holding on to that wobbly wheel
(Hold on that wobbly wheel ohh)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I told em before you go to pack a Jimmy
With a Jammy, cause who you like is pokin' Minnie
She's open like Cedars, Mickey D's and Denny's
He never listen, so we don't take any
Hopped on the bitch naked, when she got the clapper
Somebody was at the door, they came to jack her
Broke in the crib, every one of em got the strappers
But Bobby done brung nothing but his dirty dagger
These psycho shooters came and plotted the ho
Seen a sucka so they shot at the bro
They want Bobby straight demolished, abolished
And then they caught it, I woulda brought in the fo
The family’s all blood
Sick as hell cause something raw called
I was one of the friends at Bobby’s funeral like “oh no!”

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Madchild]
I got a problem
I think that probably my kemosabe’s actually Bobby
Five in the morning, down in the lobby
Drunk but on coke so he’s not even wobbly
He got his problems, hope he can solve em
Talking to bitches that look like a goblin
He’s doing coke and he think that she’s dope
But her feet are as big as a couple toboggans
Once every month or so, quits and goes joggin'
Knowing there’s something that’s wrong with his noggin
Spends all his money and drives a jalopy
Actin's his passion and rap is his hobby
Smashin' and bashin', his fashion is sloppy
Laughin' and lashin' out, actin' up oddly
He’s got a crew, and when they all start mobbin'
That’s when my brother Slaine turns into Bobby

[Hook x2][Evidence]
Yo the rhyme excursions touch minds like brain surgeons
Feel the lyric teargas - even on clean versions
No profanit goddamnit hard like granite to the utmost
I'm butter on rye - always high but play the low post
I stretch to go the distance yo my lungs are mad elastic
I'm dope on plastic like Flex I always keep it classic
Expressions in the facial I'm on Rachel from caribbean rhythms
I hit 'em with a battered flow padded with circles added twice
I'm nice on ice the line slice your dome
And separate rhymes from poems
My life....
Ain't tryin to see no grammy or oscar
Best believe these styles will rub off like pastas
On people yo check Dilated Evidence
The influential rock rhymes in sequential format
You'll see the doormat if you acting disaccordingly
Something to the effect of Fatboys in Disorderlies

[Mad Child]
I'll take you from He-Man to She-Ra
Battle Cat to Cringer
Medieval Messenger, west coast avenger
Take it to the street battle me? That's a fucking sin
Go one round with Mad Child you'll be sucking wind
Snapping handcuffs just for de-concentration
Then I broke out the bus - a mental hospital patient
On a weekend pass but I still come sick
Psychopathic you're dealing with a deranged lunatic
Soon to kick your teeth in, and then go berserk
Even Van Gogh looked at me and said you're one piece of work
So I said lend me an ear, cause I'm the state of the art
First I'll feast on your brain, then rip your body apart
There's a part of your heart stuck in between my fangs
Wrap a rope around your neck, and you still couldn't hang
Cause you're way off track, you need realignment
Murdering masterpieces in solitary confinement

[Everlast]
I'll keep your backside open like the english channel
I rock the sure shot, I keep it hot like flannel
I'll survey your panel with my foot up in your anal
You think it can't happen? Kid, cause I'm rappin'?
Ain't no gun clappin' cut the jaw jackin'
Let the joints get shot and see where it's not
Then kick off your shoes jump off my jock
And check the new style Whitey Ford's prone to rock
Once upon a time, not long ago
Before Hip Hop was made for the radio
An MC show had to co-rock the masses
Used to wear a kangol with the clear gazelle glasses
So bang bang boogie up jump the party
Someone clapped off and scattered everybody
Drunk off bacardi, high off the trauma
It's death from above the livest dive bomber
In the squadron I break formation
I get New York love like my name's Ken Son
??At tea?? they rock bells till they break the dawn
Steady puffin owl's and fight hell like spawn
My moves are animated my crew's reinstated
While you cats suspension's up in my dimensions
We can ease tensions or we can get rowdy
So I'mma keep it on the love and do my duty/doody like howdy

[Divine Styler]
Direction short term plan regionalize rhyme boards
With the hordes - I'm satan dynasty killer
Refill the chords with the sling on down
Venom spit regurgitate def scripts I sound
Cylinder never python, prevail Mad Child
Physical justic can't rush this for now
Move fake of the game time set backs don't sweat that
God don't test that - too much infinite to get at
Space to fills all the members got the illa drills
And if you with the rhyme skill
Bust the revealings of my feelings of these dealings
Will the represent shall
I build three phases of death
The illusion is to sweat that you reflect
When you feel the veil
Divine Styles circumnavigate nine circles of hell
You keep on you don't stop cause a nigga never stay stale
WudaWudaWudaWudaWudaWudaWhat I'm saying is is that...
You ain't you ain't ready for that shit (echoes)[Intro]
Look at yourself and write down the truth. What more fatal complex subject could you find? It’s hard to face. Or maybe you’re afraid of yourself

[Verse 1]
[Madchild]
Daylight fright. They might bite
I get so high. I’m high as a kite
Fly to new heights. I try to do right
Grow older, weight of the world’s on my shoulders
People are bad, pretend to be helpless
Mad give juice to the youth. I’m selfish
I try to explore the dark side of the road
Skeleton’s dangling. Star-spangled mangling
I’m all tangled up in two gangs I’m fucked
Devour smurf. It’s all our turf
Let’s kick through the fence and waste a few heads
But karma’s a bitch that you’ll face when you’re dead
Sweet demon, take me to a level that’s a true test
Devil in a blue dress, I’ll do what I do best
Control freak speak. Do as I say
When you and I play cause you are not safe

[Hook]

Here I go again, here I go again
[X4]

[Verse 2]
The mind suffers. Thoughts are all scattered
With delicate matters and elegant patterns
A trail of myself. I’m beyond redemption
Weak to temptation, I’m filled with tension
Attract acts of vengeance. I will go the length
Cause I rap with my grandfather’s strength
I will not lose my family
Miracle man, you can’t stand me
I push for my dreams. Only God can command me
Black hand dark prints of the city
It’s hideous language. Bad blood on canvas
No partners we will keep building
I swear on the lives of my unborn children
That I would burn in Hell just to keep you safe
But I will stimulate my growth while I keep my faith
Give you everything inside my skull
These are the memoirs of a troubled soul

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, y’all know my voice is like a chainsaw. Yeah

[Verse 1: Slaine]
I grew up inside a sick world, so I’m a sick fuck
Got a mulatto model bitch. This chick is mixed up
Met her in Colorado. She knew how to swallow
My dick was hard as a brick. Balls like an avocado
And I ain't mean that its green bitches
I slip the clip inside a gun. Yeah, I mean business
I say what I mean. Lean with obscene rhythms
Swore the plaintiff spittin' semen at these teen bitches
As the rhyme scheme switches
At the crime scene. Shitfaced, I'm 19, vicious
My aunty used to remind me
How I was just a lost soul. No-one could find me
Smokin' angel dust till I look like a zombie
I'm back spittin' lyrics. I'm a crook like you want me (listen up)
I've got a bad habit and a loaded gun
The night is young and there ain't nothing I can't overcome

[Verse 2: Madchild]
My voice is like a garborator
Fuck it. I'm a terminator, bubbling like we carbonated
Shining like a conflict. You don’t want a conflict
Listen close. Center of my mind, hear a bomb tick
Break into a fit. Little Incredible Hulk
My lyrics' bullets riddle you with metal assault, HA!
Listen up, bitch. I can spit a mouthful
Turn it up and hear my voices blurring through your household
Go to bed at 7 and I spit like a zombie
Happy days are here again and I’m fuckin' Fonzie
And me? I'm gonna quit rap when hell freeze over
Spit evil lyrics. I’m a hell bent cobra
Here to manhandle you and shatter you bastards
Mentally a gorilla spitting battery acid
Machine gun preacher. Cartoon features. PTTTTT!!
Spit hard tunes. A dark moon creature
These rappers are robots. R2 D2
Boba Fett mask shit is hard to breathe through
I'm firing on all cylinders
Got me to Beluga Bazooka the small Dillinger
Fucking with me? Stupid. Recruiting in all villages
Mentally recouping, regrouping to rock militants
Never go full retard
Leopard print leotard, peppermint sweetheart[Verse 1]
My condition is critical
Twice as nice as the price is
When I select a electronic device to make a sequence
Frequent blows of rejection in my section
No action, no satisfaction
I'm takin a walk in the wrong direction
Is Mad Child blocked [?] marked don't even ask it
I'm like E.T. with the blanket in a bycicle basket
Rapped so tight like a vice-grip
Don't trip, feel the tension
[?] who drops like a [?] its beyond comprehension
Claustrophobic, i've founded that i'm surrounded
With a no-win situation afraid its too complicated
Technical combination [?] skeptical and dubs
And fears with sharks and tears will come out empty-handed
Branded [?] I fuckin hate it
I rock with a box and cock my cap so its crooked
Look at theres no gimmick to mimick i'm just twisted

[Hook x2]
Lack of blood to the brain, leaves me insane
I'm twisted!

[Verse 2]
Unpractical tactical techniques when I speak
Weak minded MCs freezin wack tracks posin frozen
I spread my tight butt cheecks and stick the nose in
Bulldozin over duck MCs, suck on these!
[?] what's really goin on, you better recognize
No second tries I despise ass kids and busters
I couldn't trust her, that topic is microscopic
Compared to the whole spectrum of things
Hot like tropical storms, warm and rapid
Capitating twelve heads
Well fed, if you eat my food for thought, its edible bulk
I bust into a rage like the Incredible Hulk
Don't sulk, just hide inside the closet as I deposit
Data into the memory bank
You spank over the texture of my constructure
Rough like stucco
I rock Pumas, fat laces, [?] and B-Boy belt buckles
Suckas, chuckle, fuckle them wack MCs
I flow like the breeze [?]
The keys to [?] is what I am
Scram, scoot-skedadle, you shouldn't try to battle
Tight rappers you're running circles around
Just like a satelite, not bad, aight?
Naw, west coast rocks the most!
And the [?] rascal [?] open a map and you can't come close

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Lack of blood to the brain, no simulation
Pacing back and forth, I can't function
My concentration is gone!
Omision wishin to pick up the pieces
To make [?]
Tension increases at a rapid rate
Birds of a feather flock together
So the Mad Child's alone prone to zodiac dimension
All I've got is my reflection, even then i'm shadow boxin
Tryin to make mends with God but the devil always walks in
Lets see you fuckin bastard: the master of deception and persuasion
Rushin to my soul like an invasion
And the Dark Angel's clutches as much as I try to fight for whats right
He's in control, the strangle-hold is too tight

[Hook x2](Verse 1 - Madchild)
Lyrics that I spit can seem unsettling
Rap like I’m on ephedrine and ornithine, sprinkled with amphetamine
Glass man standing, the last man standing
Not too many make it back from a bad crash landing
I was flyin' higher than a jet
Now I'm clean so every lyrics that I spit is fuckin' wet
I'm a vet, I'm a king. Canadian, a mystic mind
To the States I'm an alien like District 9
I am back, I am hot, got a fish to fry
Open my mouth and let the bullets from the pistol fly
I am finished with these thugs, causin' mischief guy
So the past can kiss my ass, that's a kiss goodbye

(Chorus)
Madchild, I'm under ground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine
Prev1, he's underground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine

(Verse 2- Prevail)
No shatter-proof plexiglass can save you from the battle axe
They're just too sharp, cut straight through. My autograph
Illegible, but still says Prevail in the boldest print
Rhyme anarchist, overthrowin' rap government
Superbeast and Predator, deadliest of hunting parties
A very impressive army, we're burying many bodies
Carrying pitchfork and torch through the castle ground
Master of confusion watch the little monster chop you down
Then I grind down the bone, spread all the dust about
Trust me you're rusty, I'm animal style, In & Out
When in doubt, ask for a professionals opinion
Blasting caps, TNT, my dynamite provision
Enriching my livings a given, so we Mad Max
Madchild, Prevail, Rob the Viking, we want rap back
Diamondback, Black Mamba, Lawnmower Man
Watch the blade spitters blade, one that's made from the pen again

(Chorus)
Madchild, I'm under ground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine

(Verse 3- Madchild)
I'm the reigning champ, I'm the reigning champ
Make these other rappers look like they're in training camp
Drugs fuckin' suck, they will drain your bank
I'm the greatest, I'm inflated, got my brain to thank
Rap like I'm infected in the head
Lyrics that I spit could fuckin' resurrect the dead
Actin' like a lunatic, rappin' like a wild boy
Told you motherfuckers you don't wanna look inside boy
Fuck shit up like the Taliban in hammer pants
Call the fuckin' ambulance, cuz I'ma cause an avalanche
Brighter than a lava lamp, throw you in the mud fucker
My skin is shinin' like a diamond, I'm a blood sucker
Indestructible, a circus freak side show
Doper than a hundred pounds of hydro on fire bro
I'm still here, I provide a new identity
Creeping through your mind like a centipede on ketamine

(Chorus)
Madchild, I'm under ground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine
Prev1, he's underground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine[Intro: From Psycho]
We all go a little mad sometimes. He just...goes a little mad sometimes

[Verse 1]
Sick of gay, sick of gay, sick of gay habits
Now I ping-ping like I'm Ricochet Rabbit
Ain't nobody getting sick of me. I never skip a beat
Look at me. I turn a rapper into faggot fricassee
On to being blonde and smelly. Thumbs up like Arthur Fonzarelli
I'm James Bond but got a hunkered belly
Hella grubby. Jump on stage, look like a Teletubby
Girls all in the front row, still all of the fellas love me
Because I'm underground. Love the fucking underground
Wonderful the undertow. I love to make the thunder pound
Throwing bolts of lightning like the mighty Thor from Asgard
Rock like Nazareth. Jump on tracks and spaz hard
Last five years of my life was the bad part
Next ten years of my life, I'm making mad art
My priority is high priority
I'm hi-fi Sci-Fi; prizefight orally

[Hook]
People listen to me and say that's that shit
Every verse is better than my last batch is
Never hear me do no half ass shit
I'm a lab rat, fat cat. Mad's back, shit!

[Verse 2]
I'm not hard to figure out: you could read me like a leaflet
A hyperactive beatnik with psychiatric treatment
I don't care if it is forever or only briefly
Every rapper in the world is going to be beneath me
Trust me, you don't want to fuck with me. I'm sucker-free
Stab you with your mother's cutlery. I'm not your cup of tea
Super Beast: a stupid geek and toy-collecting comic nerd
Sound alarms and dropping fucking bombs with each atomic verse
I'm lawless, mother-fucker; I'm lawless
I'm flawless. On the rocks again like I'm a walrus
Do what seems impossible to some. I'm a honkey
I'll kick you in the mother-fucking face like I'm a donkey
I'm bonkers. I'm wacko. I'm loopy. I'm zany
Say goodnight to the bad guy and 'fuck you; pay me'
Explosive like a landmine. Hot like a sand dune
Strong like bamboo and clean like shampoo

[Hook]

[Outro]
(Crazy) Mother-fucker I am
(You're crazy) Mother-fucker I am
(You're crazy) Tell these ducks that I'm
(I like you, but you're crazy)[Verse 1:]

Yo, Yo
I still split atoms and neutrons
Killing every rapper from LA to the Yukon
We used to pass Grey Poupon
Now I'm clipping coupons with an old touque on
Demi-god got doing debit fraud
Flat broke rap star no credit card
Yeah my head is hard, call me Mr. Thing
We rap fast, slow it down
So you don't miss a thing
I don't miss a thing
I'm a vicious king
Not havin' any cash when it's christmas stings
And I am intergalactic
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle doing back flips
(Let ‘em have it)
Raw denim and some new balance
Hit you like pow! Right to the moon Alice!
I ain't got no money, but I'm on one
Wombat, I'm a swamp rat drinking pond scum
I'm growing crops on my farmland
Kill a fucking nazi with a swatstika armband
Life's a popularity contest
Madchild's back one of the scariest monsters
I fucked this girl, she was barely unconscious
But now she wanna marry me, so therapy's nonsense
Yeah I'm back, I'm a powerhouse
You a little hot dog, full of sauerkraut
Madchild I'm a fuckin' Grizzly
You won't make it rain dog, it's barely drizzling
Think you're shit's hot? Mine is fucking sizzling
Yeah I'm fly, I'm a fucking frisbee
Your fault they are not listening
You on some Mickey Mouse shit
Walt Disney (hahaha)
And you rap for the wrong reasons
But my wheels keeping spinning
All season

[Verse 2:]
Hey look
Yeah I know
I was living wrong, but I know how to make it right
Yelling I'm on fire when I'm naked, Talladega Nights (ahh)
Yeah Madchild's back, you better say goodnight
Bust a sharp left, when I break right
I ain't stopping, I am running every red light
Make you stop like a deer caught in my headlights
Scratching your head like you got headlice
Thinking how the fuck did he come back?
He's been dead twice
Madchild, I'm running wild like a loose cannon
Daydream racing Drake in a new phantom
I'm coming through in a race
I'm a beast because I rap until I'm blue in the face
Get It I'm a beast until I'm blue the face
Get it cracking like a bat with an aluminum base
Misguided angel, I'm a demon killer
Bad man in the mirror, I'm a fucking thriller
(Which means you better fucking beat it man)

[Verse 3:]
Hey
Madchild spit razor sharp, like an x-acto blade
The pterodactyl, I'm a Jackyl with these accolades
Hanging like a macrame
Crack rock hit the jackpot, smoke a pack a day
I'm tinfoil in your microwave
Roll up on a BMX, shoot you in the face and ride my bike away
Work of art Leonardo Da Vinci
Never wander I will turn a fucking bully to mincemeat
I rap retardedly I'm hardly a mystery
In a cardigan, I'm (?) mass marauder from Disney (Wow)
It's like water and listerine
Now that my piss clean people are listening

[Outro:]
That's it, wow
Oh Boy
The kid's back!
The Pepsi-Cola kid's back!
The silver surfer is back!
I'm from the wild west motherfucker![Куплет 1: Oxxxymiron]
Сомнения слетаются с утра
Моя бритая башка – это их Лысая гора
Сколько ещё лет будет мясо и рубилово?
И сколько ещё куплетов про себя любимого?
Я здоров, как бык, но смертельно болен
Ведь от священных коров отвык
Ильдабаоф, он же Иегова, он же Князь мира сего
Суёт перо в кадык
За окном под видом города гниёт нарыв
Я режу вас турбиною во снах
Не реже, чем под Аль-Джазиру мастурбирую на снафф
Желаю смерти пары редколлегий, пары рэп-коллег
И я не Дейл Карнеги, мне всё это на руку, как Брейгель
Мне снится то глава Ампира «В»
То в эфире ТВ живая голова Эльвиры Т
У меня кризис жанра!
Не Индиана, но всё из последних сил
Как прыжок в дилижанс из дирижабля
Что? Слышь, ногами на коврик!
Якобы, ты говорил, что я сдулся?
Но, видимо я ипохондрик
Если держу свою руку на пульсе
И в этом году я смогу либо переродиться
Либо загнусь от конвульсий
Ведь на хуй жить, если новой не сложить песни?
И к чему вычурная полисиллабика
Коль из нового ничего, летит моль из динамиков?
Мой второй альбом
Будет эталон, либо в этанол с головой!
Ты говно, либо гений – среднего не дано!

[Припев: Oxxxymiron]
А! Твоя мигрень – балаган!
Тут больше четверти века набекрень голова!
Мы идём на глубине путями тёмными
Под веществами ещё не изобретёнными![Verse 1]
I broke my piggy bank and haven't put it back together
Back in heaven blastin' rounds like I'm a MAC-11
Livin' in my rainy city it was all wrong
Used to be the big fish in a small pond
Now I'm swimming with the sharks but I'm a down piranha
Plus I'm moving Fast & Furious like Brian O'Conner
Rest in peace, a restless beast
Call me Mighty Mouse, pocket's full of extra cheese, yup
Still a mental savage that is ravenous, indeed
Exerting psycho babble from a labyrinth in me
Angels flying up above, demons down beneath
When I'm breathing you can hear the evil seeping through my teeth
Close friends worth more than cash and havin' wealth
Self destructive beings are a hazard to themself
Lion roars, stronger than an iron door
Sun has killed the rain, love has killed the pain that I endure

[Hook]
Half these rappers are the liars like Pinocchio
10% are dope, other 90 less than okey-doke
You don't wanna rope-a-dope with Mad, you get the broken nose
Small but when I'm rappin' I am taller than the Poconos
My soul is mischievous like A-Plus and Opio
A toy collector, plus my clothes, they come from Tokyo
I'm not sayin' I got the dopest flow
But kids are studyin' my methods like a vocal coach

[Verse 2]
My brain's a battlefield for devils and angels
Walkin' contradiction like machetes and rainbows
Burdeon on my shoulders that is heavy and painful
Shane's raw, tearin' shit like Eminem's chainsaw
Battle Mad and you could be in real danger
Excruciating training like a Navy SEAL ranger
Run for cover, bounty hunter like I'm Bobafett
Wild west bounty hunter like I'm Jonah Hex
Ay, bitch, I could talk to the dead
You connect with me cause I can read the thoughts in your head
Yeah, mentally projecting till I'm causing metamorph(os)is
Almost lost my head like the fucking headless horsemen
Holdin' a jack-o-lantern, acrobatic verbiage
Dirtiest of wordsmiths, bar game is murderous
Don't talk about it much but came up with true killers
Still here cause I'm unbreakable like Bruce Willis

[Hook]
Half these rappers out are liars like Pinocchio
10% are dope, other 90 less than okey-doke
You don't wanna rope-a-dope with Mad, you get the broken nose
Small but when I'm rappin' I am taller than the Poconos
My soul is mischievous like A-Plus and Opio
A toy collector plus my clothes, they come from Tokyo
I'm not sayin' I got the dopest flow
But kids just studyin' my methods like a vocal coach[Verse 1: Madchild]

I'm hiding in the shadow from the demons that I battle
I'm a psycho with a hypodermic needle in my ankle
My cerebral has a fire breathing ego that exists
I'm evil, people lock my sights and burn you to a crisp
My sentiments are venomous, I'm poisonous to enemies
No cure, there is no remedy -- death will be the penalty
I'm menacing, inventive with demented thoughts of grandeur
Temper is explosive, I'm a boiling pot of anger
Middle-aged mutant, deformed monstrosity
Do not have the audacity to fuck with this atrocity
Reform, deform, creeper in a tree fort
Deport, back into my country, read the report
Igor.. "why dey wanna pick on little me for?"
C4 explosives, I'm ferocious by the seashore
Keep it, you will reap it, I will give it all I got
I'm strategic, devil's reject, I will think then I will plot (Blah!)

[Verse 2: Madchild]

I will have the last laugh, I'm a fuckin' bad man
Surround my house with sand bags, like in fuckin' Bahgdad
They don't feel the fire yet? They will feel the back draft
Hand makin' bullets when I'm listenin' to Black Flags
Selectors, they are sodomized, detecting me on satellite
Sneak across the border to Seattle with a pad and mic
DJ play a battle break, I'm battling on stage
I'm a rattle snake, you kids should not be rattling my cage
And I don't give a fuck about a rapper with a buzz
I'll happily attack him and extract a little blood
Like packing an exacto, I'm exact with the result
Your friends can ask what happen, you'll say "Crap, it was my fault.."
I'm an albatross, fuckin' falcon claws
Half mountain lion, countless crimes but I'll be fine
My blood is mixed with alkaline
Kill the little monster, he is obviously insane
He's probably just a goblin that has problems with his brain

[Verse 3: Madchild]

I go to bed at night, I'm dreaming of revenge
But I'm tossing and I'm turning, candle burning at both ends
I wake up asking "Don't you hear the laughing?"
They don't hear it
Every night I pray to God, "Protect us from these evil spirits."
Lyrics like I'm touched by the angels; I'm dangerous
Put my words together in the strangest arrangements
I'm blooming from my vanity; illuminate insanity
Accumulating doom related lines that leave you panicking
A samurai; I guess I glamorize being traumatized
Promise I will never compromise with these homicides
An alligator salivating, calibrating jaws
Rap of malady I'll gravitate to gladiator dogs
Divine separatist, rhyme defined specimen
Combine efforts, align sublime specialist
I design, refine lines is my weaponry
Trying to find destiny, God provides recipe[Verse 1]
I had a crush on this girl, we used to smoke indo
She lived across the street
I threw a rock through her window
As a kid I wasn’t making any sense
Screaming out her name, standing naked on a fence
She called the cops, I been hating ever since
Sometimes I still look back and think of what we might have been
That broken glass cost me seven hundred bucks
I was eleven, man, seven hundred bucks man
Fuck man, I seen her the other night
Hanging off a brass pole high as a kite
Dancing at a strip club, she got picked up
I got my dick sucked, she got tit fucked
She sucked my ball sack and licked my asshole
I came in her hair then she called me an asshole
Then I called her a cab and gave her five bucks
Said that’s all that I have

[Hook]
I’m addicted to being a dickhead
Tell a girl anything just to get head
I’m a fucking prick
Shut the fuck up bitch and suck my dick

I’m addicted to being a dickhead
Tell a girl anything just to get head
I’m a fucking prick
Now shut the fuck up bitch and suck my dick

[Verse 2]
How many people get to have sex with four strippers?
At the same time and it doesn’t make a difference
I’m a spoiled little brat, rock star lifestyle
I don’t want to talk, let’s fuck right now
Hang around and get mistreated cause I’m conceited
If you don’t like it beat it
I’ll just take the next slut standing in line
If you’re not here to suck it then you’re wasting my time
You’re here to please me and serve me
I’m here to make fun of you make you feel unworthy
Getting bitches takes no effort
Skinny ones with no tits to big fat heifers
Look a girl in the eyes and say I love her
The next day I tell my friends I never heard of her
Mad Child’s a womanizer like no other
Call me a motherfucker cause I’ll fuck your mother

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Please don’t call me on the phone cause I live with my girl
And I will say it’s the wrong number
And if you call me back I will find out where you live
And then I will turn your life to shit
So just remember that you’re just a slut made for sucking balls
I got a girlfriend she broke my heart
Now every night I rip a different piece of pussy apart
Straight sport fucking, she’s a whore fuck it
Treat em like a piece of shit till I kick the bucket
I’m so persuasive and every girl is beautiful when Mad Child’s wasted
Rub my balls in her face and make her promise not to say shit
I’ll put her number in my phone then erase it
I’m an asshole, face it, I just pretend when I act like a friend
I’m not your homie, here’s an update cupcake
Just blow me and show me your best fuck face

[Hook][Intro]
Fuck this economy
Cigarettes and red bull

[Verse 1]
I am the provider with the spider and the Viking
And on the typewriter, I am divider of the titans
Faster than a motorbike and brighter than a bolt of lightning
Tight is when I hold the mic explode and show the world excitement
Totally enlightened and walking on a different path
When I hit a verse it's like a fucking car collision crash
The rate of rebuilding my life, it isn't fast
I don't care how rich I get, I'm never flying business class
Put me in economy; I don't care who you bunch of stars
Like it's astronomy and I am an anomaly
The type of verses that I spit could be a real problem
Ill goblin climbing up the hill, hobbling
Still squabbling; unidentified flying object
They wondering whats inside my closet
Little, green martians and Sci-Fi projects
And big, furry monsters with eyes like targets
Carcass with a parka wearing a motorcycle helmet
Help me: I'm a psycho with a knife and mental illness
Give me a gun; I am troublesome
Cause I'm quick to pop a rapper like he's bubble gum

[Hook]
I got drugs in my pocket and I don't know what to do with them
Drugs in my pocket
I got drugs in my pocket and I don't know what to do with them
Drugs in my pocket, drugs in my pocket
He put drugs in my pocket, man, I thought that I was through with them
Yeah, drugs in my pocket
I got drugs in my pocket and I don't know what to do with them
Drugs in my pocket, drugs in my pocket

[Verse 2]
Got a red under my bed
There's a little, yellow man in my head
I'm a bipolar polar bear zipping up a polar fleece
Drinking Polar Ice and Pepsi Cola on a coral reef
Every lyric that I spit is an oral feat
Elbows on my knees, head in hands thinking 'poor, old me'
I keep a strap tucked; at least a sharp blade
Cause kids be playing more games than an arcade
And I am not afraid: I will shoot you dead
There's more snakes in this club than Medusa's head
I'm still underground: call me Tomb Raider
While I rap with iron jaws like Moonraker
You keep lying while you tell the kids your cool fables
I'll chop your fucking head off and leave it on the pool table
I'm not too stable: I am off my rocker
I'll lift you while making noises like I was Chewbacca
I'm fucking dope, like I could cook the rock up
He's a malacka and I'm down to knock his fucking block off
So thank-you, Mr. Ron Cavanaugh
My friend's in jail for more keys than a grand piano
When I say I'm hot, that means that I'm too hot to handle
If I don't make it in rap, to Willie Nelson: I can rock a banjo

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got a .38 special in the pocket of my hoodie
While I shake my pill bottle see if I still got some goodies
Give me a gun: I am troublesome
Quick to pop a fucking rapper like he's bubble gum
I swear I'll stab him with a sharpened lead pencil
Cause rappers, they got great, big heads like Fred Flintstone
I'm Michael Myers with a pair of pliers
First I'll eat your eyes and then I'll set your hair on fire
Now call me Jason with a hockey mask
Midlife crisis and I'm still a little, cocky brat
I'm tired of all these copycats
I need some help: I've never felt this fucked
Cause I had everything and then I had to self-destruct
Now I've got nothing but I swear that I am not complaining
Signing out from Canada: Van' city where it's always raining[Intro]
Yeah I'm Excited Man , Clarity in my life dog

[Verse 1]
Yo
My charge is federal, verses come in edible bulk
I'm unforgettable, yep little Incredible Hulk
Think you on fire? I'm a fire hydrant,
Small tyrant but stand like a tall giant so vibrant
Trust me I'm a Hi-Fi Sci-Fi project
But I'm a white boy so I drive by projects
I'm a king call me Maharabi
But I'm a Kamikaze in a trench coat sitting in your lobby
You can catch me in the toque playing a little hockey,
But I sold all of my rings no more Liberace
Who needs diamonds, open up my mouth and I shine when
I rhyme and get paid for assignments
I used to be so off alignment in an awful climate
But now I'm back on the grid like a waffle iron
Put me in the Fantastic Four I'll be the Human Torch
Nah I'm the Silver Surfer hes a stupid dork
Like Mork from Ork in his rainbow suspenders,
Battle anybody shit there ain't no contenders
Swollen Members that's a name to remember
Best out this summer be the same in December
I'm the misguided angel I'm insane with revenge
Kill you kill your DJ and the same for ya friends
Revenge like the Punisher take out ya family
Call me "2-12" I will take out humanity
Better start panicking its gonna be anarchy
I'm back shit I got this covered like a canopy

[Hook x2]
RAH RAH like a Dungeon Dragon
Mad Child kill a couple hundred faggots
You don't wanna become my baggage
Warlock stirring up a cauldron magic

[Verse 2]
Rapper with the repetition of a strobe light special wishing separate vision I am so bright
Snow white but I ain't got seven dwarfs
A little devil Im just trying to get through heavens doors
Drugs are bad they lure you with no control
And leave you empty like a whore with a broken soul
My minds dangerous I'm on remote control
I pull your heart out of your chest and leave an open hole
I quit drugs now I'm perfectly in tune
I'm the Silver Surfer I am surfing through your room
Yea perfectly in tune while I circulate the boon
I go to bed at six and I percolate and noon
And everything is work related proliferated doom
Rappers think they're Hercules regurgitating goons
Crazy clown face dance like its Halloween
While baby rocky knock you out like Apollo Creed (RAH RAH)
Real life war monger, I killed brain cells came back more stronger
Mad Child old school newcomer
I lost 4 winters and blew through summers
A Mercenary with a scary lack of mercy
But it's remarkable I land with total accuracy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah
I'm older than the phone on the wall in your grandmas kitchen
I still roll down windows and say "bitchin'"
I do not get paid for a week of missing
Mad Child bout as old as Colecovision
I reek of wisdom you can hear it though your speaker system
Battle Axe all my freaks are listening
Help me I'm really freaking I don't see an out
I'm the sickest rapper and got diarrhea of the mouth
A lot of rappers talk what they don't be about
It leaves a lot of them out there including me in doubt
EH, you see my mouth? It's full with rotten teeth
I don't care how rich you are bitch talk is cheap
Unless you get a verse from me
I'm smarter then an 8 year term in university
Try not to take it personally
I do this perfectly I got a buzz like a worker bee

[Outro]
RAH RAH (hows that for an ending)
RAH RAH like a Dungeon Dragon
RAH RAH like a Dungeon Dragon
(B-A-X-W-A-R Battle Axe Warriors)
RAH RAH like a Dungeon Dragon
(I'm holding it down here in the fort with my dogs Jekyll and my dog Lola)
