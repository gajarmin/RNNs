[Intro: Chris Webby]
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Dopamine, dopamine
That I'm on, that I want
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Dopamine, dopamine

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
See dopamine is what your brain is makin' when your feelin' happy
So, if your tryna' feel what I'm feelin' then yo get at me
And me? I get me fix from all sorts of shit
Every night a glass of milk with some Oreo's I can dip
Fresh pot of mom's sauce, macaroni, meatballs
That smell of Sour Diesel when I open up the jar
Break it up and rollin' somethin', breakin' off a ho I'm fuckin'
Pop a little ecstasy and get that serotonin pumpin'
Goin' commando in a pair of sweats
Reruns of Sopranos up on my TV set
And that dopamine be flowin' on stage
Feel it every time that shit is goin' my way
It's chillin' with your best homies
The spittin' game, it's gettin' laid and it's that after sex bogie
Any time you feelin' good, it's what your brain produces
So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's supposed to be
And that's the shit that I'm on, that's the shit that I want
Whether I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
That bamma weed you smokin', ain't fuckin' with the OG
I hit it till I'm coughing, I hit it often
I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge because I know the ledge
I wake up when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin', I'm bounty huntin' like I'm Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, we born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Now why do I expose these niggas'? I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical warnings, gettin' as gory as biblical stories, you  ignoring the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene
You ever live the life of a heretic?
That, dopamine, from the smoke the coke the lean, is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
I'm just tryna' get my fix

[Verse 3: Grafh]
Bitch on my lap, gyratin'
Loud so loud, my lungs vibratin'
High as a bitch I'm up skyscappin'
Annihilatin' some kind of Sanaa Lathan
That's the feelin' I feel when I am creatin'
And the fire's escapin', though your fire escape
Until I lie in your basement
Arise in the pavement just to arrive from inside of a spaceship
That fix, I'm suppose to dream
I chase Hennessy with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober
Promethazine in my soda, I'm supposed ta lean
My momma cookin'? Encore
The family members I die for
The two beautiful kids that I stay alive for
Plus Hip-Hop makes me feel alive more
That fix

[Hook: Chris Webby]

[Verse 4: B-Real]
Let me put you down, with some realness
You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
We're the feelin' that you get when you open up your bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
We're the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelled it
We the vibe at the party, when that shit's about to turn up
We the "hell ya", ya thinkin' when the dabs about to burn up
The fist pump, bitch I'm number one, I'm the winna' by the
Toast at the table when we celebrating [?]
Roar of the crowd when ya see something amazing
We're the thrill of victory, we're the felling of elation
It's a presentation and we hope you see
You're in need of that dopamine

[Bridge: Chris Webby]

[Verse 5: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, Truth spit game, murda'
Shoulda' been cased on it
Causing panic, 9-11 shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, knowing they woman' face on it
Money long, snakes, givin' a open chase on it
I'm fully sober, my fix is chicks and change
And ridin' lookin' amazing in something so strange
I hit the hood, just to kick it with homies
Knowing they need it for support, everyone left 'em lonely
I do my best to dodge the phoney, cuz' I don't understand them
And I ain't tryin'
I'm the truth and I don't fuck with that lyin'
Stay from beside 'em
Hit the studio to blackout, every track gettin' packed out
Just like somebody woman as soon as I blow her back out
Might just give a laugh as I proceed to knock a track out
And burn off with my speakers in the trunk, who tryna' act out?
Say Watson tell Boogz I'm on my turn up
Get [tightest?] in them [?], meet me at Dreams, we bout to turn up

[Hook: Chris Webby][Intro] [Apathy talking]
(Yo) yeah, yo. I don't know what song I'm gonna do (check)
But my man Unknown told me to rip this motherfucker
(Yo Apathy), so I'm gonna rip this motherfucker

[Verse One] [Apathy]
I ain't the type to trick for chicks or lick their clits
I make 'em grip the dick in the whip and strip for chips
Treat a bitch like a foe, givin' hoes no doe
With pros I never snooze, I consume No-Doz
If they're poppin' that trash then I'm droppin' 'em fast
Then put 'em in a body cast with an oxygen mask
I'm the bitch whipper, clip gripper, chick sticker, clit licker
Sip liquor, spit quicker, flip sicker, scrips ricochet, hit a brick
Stray bullet split tips of those Bics that you grip when you writin' wack shit
I can split molecules like the body of blunts
And karate punch you punks leave your bodies in chunks
I char flesh and scar chests like porn stars breasts
To find a squad that could test, you're hard pressed
I'll spit a rap to knock mics out like little mac
And fit a little metal cap right inside your fitted cap
If you spit again I'm slippin' in your little sister's school
And have her sniffin' Ritalin and make her grab my dick again
And stick it in until I split that little kinky bitch in two
And you ain't eve seen my finishin' move

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Don't even ask for me
Go ahead and ask for "Trouble"
I'm known to push back wigs and pull the extensions on your chick
Unknown & Mek asked me to spit some shit
So I calculated the accurate style to come with
You better be fully equipped with equipment
That's powerful enough to polarize the Earth and bend it
Off it's axis
My acronym is a mystery
My arch nemesis is shooken, can't even look at me
Start the day right
Bullets and milk is my breakfast
I fuck the type of bitches that make Dolly Parton look breastless
This is the raw nigga rap shit
With incredible action and drama, my suspenseful persona
Is honored among thieves, so son please
You can get your guns even
And suck on these M1's that's heat seakin'
The Celph Titled legacy will live long
I put planets on my back and hold quasars in my palm
Fuck a laxative I'll beat the shit out you
And if you a pregnant bitch I'll beat the kid out you
I hope your headphones are airbag efficient
Cause when I drop science the impact is imminent

[Verse Three] [Grafh]
Guess who?
Don't guess you
No one meant you or the homo's that co-defend you
I hope it offends you
I'm on the low with the hoes that I sex through
I could have got your sister pregnant
You wouldn't know I know your nephew
Gangsta
Banger automatic mode, tec shoot
I don't care if it's beef with the clique, I'm goin' to get you
I'm goin' against you and everything that you 'bout
And every nigga that be bringin' you out
Fuck 'em
Fuck their label
Not signed yet? Then fuck your block
Suck my cock, I'm next
No, AT&T, I reach out and touch, nah next
I reach out and bust my nine X
That's why smart niggas elevate they mind
And dumb niggas get slugs in 'em that'll elevate they mind
Slugs in they back that'll elevate they spine
Lift their chain over their face and elevate they shine
Once they faint, elevate they shine
Without they ice grill they pussy, but with their game face they fine
That's why I add my two cents and loose change they mind
And take every game face they find and un-thug it
You got a mic in The Source, I un-plug it
If you don't like it when I fight with the four then run from it, dick[Posta Boy]
Poster Boy, Fosterville, Kay Slay the Drama King
Fuck with the kid, gotta throw ya moms over the bridge
RP put the hawk to ya over ya ribs
Keep thinkin' that the god is chillin'
I'm the reason custies is comin' to the Carter Buildin
And it ain't no tellin what I do
They may find ya body on 16th smellin like a (*jew*)
I'm the number one stunna when it comes to the east
In the Jag with the .40 cal under the seat
Nigga this is my block, Name a nigga who run me out
Friday come, you and you have your money out
Son, my gun'll bring a playboy bunny out
Somebody gotta die, I'm a try ya hunny out
Send her to ER with half her tummy out
No C-section, no infants comin out
She can't have babies again
Me and Kay gettin money so its feelin like the eighties again
Holla!

[Shells]
Ayo, You boys is silly, I'm next since Pac and Biggie
And I'm Bout Major Figgas like Dutch and Gillie
Catch Shells all-star weekend down in Philly
On my hip, pack heat like a bowl of chilly
Look - I Clap milli's, act willy, you a chump
Only kid in the hood with elevators in his truck
See, I flash bucks, rock all black doors
And my watch ice'd out like Jacobs store
When you boys gon learn I got this game lock
What you got for your deal, I spent on X-Box
Keep frontin like you hungry, I'm a feed you a biscuit
I got rock and roll bullets, leave limps like bizkit
So hey, its ya life involved - act like it is
My chain light gray like trash can lids
If one of yall take my chain - none of yall live
You like, "I ain't do it Shells", One of yall did!

[Grafh]
Cause A lot of yall are fakin', one minute is As-salamu alaykum
2 minutes later is where's my salami bacon
Niggas swear the product they makin' requires rockin an aprin
They liars cause its Betty Crocker they bakin
Not that I'm sayin that I Cook, Cause I dont
I keep it as raw as you seen it before it was put on the boat
The hookers'll open they jaw for free
Fuck being a gentleman, ya girlfriend open the door for me
When a pimp walk the beat, you shut up one day
The day the dick had ya mother next up one way
I come up one way drunk pushin a porshe
Make beef and I'm cookin the sauce - Gravy!
I be lookin like a boss
I pop at ya hood on ya snorkle til I have the fur lookin like a scarf
Lookin like I robbed 'em
Tell cops is easy to find like chinks in a nail shop
Holla, cheah!

[Cassidy]
Ayo, get back get back for I click clack click clack
Where that shit at? Get that 'for I bust shots!
Get crunk if you want to, drunk if you want to
Front if you want to, And get slumped with the gun too
Gimme mine cause any time I could run through
And put ya brains on the mini blinds in sun roof
Try run dog, you can try hide man
But when I bust the gun dog, you gon die man
I drinkin rum dog and I'm gettin high man
Say good bye man or a prayer - "Aman"
Look It ain't hard to get at you dudes
I screw waitresses that'll slip shit in ya food
I got yay for sale and I got crazy shells
I got it locked from Illadelph to ATL
The wait is over, I'm a take it over
I'm a bubble like vinegar and baking soda
Easy!

[Jae Hood]
Ayo, I'm a D-Block nigga - I don't respect wack rhymes
If you had a gat in a clock, you couldn't kill time
Yall cowards don't want beef, why even start?
Yall like dicks in the pool - none of yall hard
Come thru in the spit white 330 with a mean birdie
Holdin my hammer cause she know its dirty
You got questions, holla at me - I tell you whats what
Lay you on ya back and yall chumps'll really see whats up
On the real, yall niggas better chill
Think ya crew spittin flames - I'll put ya hot dogs on the grill
It gotta be a conspiracy if niggas ain't feelin me
Like a nigga with no eyes - yall not seein me
Call me a director - I give clips to ya broad
Bullets is like gum - How they stick in ya jaw
Go 'head, call the narcs - I put a hole thru ya heart
And leave you on the train tracks in a shopping cart
This ain't just beats and bars, Its things i'll do to you
In Compton fuck, I'm tryin to get through to you
The gauge'll open ya chest like vics
How you went from being soft to hard - niggas is dicks
I don't wanna hear nothin bout ya coke and ya toast
Liars get shot in they tongue - I'll put the mack to ya throat motherfucker!Babe girl… Babe girl

In those jeans
Pretty thick like I like it

[Grafh Verse 1]
Got damn
Look at the way that you wearing them jeans
I wanna get lost somewhere in them jeans
And grind my way around
I wanna get lost and find my way around
And hit that spot
In your coke bottle shape
I hope I make the bottle break
And make your soda spill while your body shake
And bubble up, I'mma fuck the love
It's GANGSTA!
The way I like
That make a nigga wanna taste the bite
The way your waiste look right

That I forget what your face look like

But uh..I'll show you what a henny straight look like
And uh..Wanna get between them seems
So make a little more room for me in those jeans

[Hook]

[Ginuwine Verse 2]
You are the bomb
Girl you tight to death
I don't know the words to say to you
All that I know, baby all I know is
That
I'm loving what I see and I'm feeling you
I wanna know, all I wanna know is if
I could have what's up in those
Jeans
Baby can I have what's up in those jeans
Don't get alarmed cause I don't mean no harm
But I love the way you
Wear those jeans

Love the way you, wearing them I love them can
Calvin, Iceberg
Sergio, I love them
Trying to get inside of those

[Grafh Verse 3]
Aye, Aye, Aye
I wanna push your legs to the back of your head
To the back of the headboard then back to the bed
Then its back to the floor, back to the bed
Then back to the floor with your back to the floor

Your holding it back I'm rubbing your back
And when I'm pulling your hair

And make your love come down, multiply (wha)

[Hook]
Repeat x2[88 Keys]
Yo, this is 88
This is for Amadou Diallo
Rest in peace, you still here

[Fre]
Yo, I'm in a brownstone singin like Brownstone
Bird's eye view of the bodega
No Omega like Rakim
Thinkin about brother Diallo
I find it hard to swallow
Cause 41 is a hard act to follow
Who is it, it can happen tomorrow
Goes down all the time in some African community
This one just hit closer to home
Cause it happened in our backyard
This that *shit* bring us closer to home
They ask "What you writin fo'? What you writin on that paper fo'?"
Don't ask me nothing, just tell me
Who Howard Safir got it safer for, that's why my raps sour
My peoples screamin "Black power!" and "La Raza!"
From the Bronx, police bustin, it's redemption time

[J-Live]
Now on the squad car, CPR's supposed to be the motto
But in they minds, they be like "Yo, I'ma do Diallo"
I guess master's noose was a bitter pill to swallow
Cause nowadays, tips ain't the only things that's hollow
Constitution, 41 more holes in it
And cops swingin sticks like they tryin to win the pennant
And stickin sticks places where they ashamed to admit it
But that's the straw that broke the camel's back
THEY GON' GET IT!!

[Rubix]
Possessed by a nervous twitch and itchy writing finger
41 strokes through the barrel of pen for Amadou
More than a few of my personal friends
Since the beginning, it seems like it never ends
The story, ancient as biblical allegory and it's all gory
The Little Shop of City Hall Horrors
Who bakes infiltrate, agent, provocateur mission statement
Assassinate the Senate candidate, heavenly mandate

[Hook: Mos Def]
We proceeded on a country road
His mother's eyes withered swoll
Her child was never comin home
Said a prayer for his soul
As the coffin had closed, committed to the earth below
First seed she had sewn, would be a tree never grown
Shade that was never known
Who controls the Terrordome, the men with hearts made of stone
Who love only what they own

[Invincible]
Stay on your toes for a troop whose description match
Blue suits, walkin round wit a stick and...
Ready to blast with the wrath of a hollow tip
And the fact is my taxes are scholarship
I feel it in my chest cavity
The only death's apathy, so I change it for who's next after me
And that's the fullest reward
Keep the face of the lost on my bulletin board

[Wordsworth]
Yo yo, it's blue uniform, sirens, names, and badge numbers
Clubs, walkie-talkies, recipes for bad summers
Frisked, pissed after I tuck in my stuff
I really think they just like touchin my *nuts*
What's real stain they thoughts
Swear, but they won't say it in court
All they do is change the report
Riots, tryin to keep the crowd in control
They even got shows, Cops, LAPD, Highway Patrol yo yo

[A.L.]
From the cradle to the grave, they made you a slave
Brainwashed to kill each other, that's the plague that they made
I search em like readin scripts that could save you today
White is right, black is wrong, that's the label they gave
Fryin in hell, applyin jails, they got you dyin in cells
Triple six in the mix, Levine to ?spell?
Prepare for the worst, and try to hope for the best
I take a stare at the hearse, can we cope wit the stress?

[Kofi Taha]
See I live in the land of plungers
Illegal chokeholds and excessive gunshots
Where there's one millionaire for every million empty pot
And Adolf Guili think we static but he's in for a shock
They come wit automatics but we flip it
Use the one, create the four Glocks and while stocks get washed
While school doors get locked and when jobs get blocked
The confi-dence get's rock
And when the welfare's drop into the jails we stock now
After Amadou wrestlin wit freedom tacks my mind into a headlock
But *fuck* H&R, I'm a true cat
Refundin power back to our Blocks

[Hook]

[Tame One]
Good life, you can bubble or struggle
But use your brain muscle if you hustle
Don't let nobody touch you
Don't even trust the ones that trust you
Cause the ones you showin love to might bust you
Seekin as a cancer, my man got shot by Haitians or Jamaicans
Confrontations and school my mind's racin
I pride these sensations over this, now I'm hopin this
We shine for, I never got a chance to rhyme for
My role models sold bottles and stole cars
And when they got locked, I accepted all the phone calls
That's when *niggas* was real
Back before I had a deal
Back when people called Villsburg Hooterville
ILL!!!

[Jane Doe]
My mind wonders on melodic jams
An exotic bird, caged with the rage and the violence of my words
The same things I down I turn around and do
The white cops say nigga, but I say nigga too
Truth be told we hypocrites
In a materialistic society, spirituality shunned or
While young kinds get gunned on
Hibernatin in projects, which you project-ing
The pigs is crucifyin but Africans is resurrectin, Jane Doe

[Grafh]
Pataki, sending cops to come and catch me
He better send a running back to run a track meet
When I'm running through the back streets
The rat teeth of beast loving the black meat
Eatin brothers like our pigment color is that sweet
To lock a man up in prison, the standard of living
Thinking they make a better brand of man
Than the man when he went in
Rub up a man for sinnin
Handcuff his hands to the system, banned from his wisdom
With insanity in him, his mind roams like a cyclone
Damagin victim, his eyes hold savage within him
Wrath with the venom, poison his life
No ointment to boisten the might
If it's on the left, walk to the right
Until death, do your part through your life
Like a boyfriend and wife, because the day times shorter than night
You know?

[Hook]

[88 Keys]
Yo, black is fragile remember that

My name grafh baby I'm comin to town
With the 'NY' sign on the front of my crown
While y'all runnin around, stuck on the ground

With this allstar to make you check my page
And you love my songs and all the mess that I say
So you sent me a text and I replied 'yes I may' -Amen
Now I read that text
Okay, it said somethin somethin somethin somethin somethin sex
That's the only words that I remember in the text
Started on the keyboard and ended on your flesh
Started with a maybe and ended with a yes
Started between the legs and ended on ya breast

You sent me some flicks butt naked and tworkin
You look good online but look better in person

[Hook]

My soul rock the color of pop con

It might be a Benz or a Jag
But now I'm lookin for some friendz to add

So I could hop off the laptop and get in ya ass (Text me)
Tell me girl, tell me ya pass (Text me)

So when we meet up, we ain't gotta talk

[Sample]:
"I don't know what I'm gonna do."

[Ras Kass]:
Huh. I do. Get low. Ha

Bar none, when I spit a bar, I spit a bar
Hennessy, Hypnotic, Patron
Courvoisier, Grey Goose
I grill niggas, spit a barbecue
Committing drive-bys out a grey Coupe
When I start drowning rappers, dawg, it ain't cute
Till every person in they group turn blue like they Snoop
Watch face blue, but I'm grimey duke
I like most of y'all niggas better in your shiney suits
At the hood, after hours, when I'm on the loose
Cause I hang with troops like Sadaam on a noose
So fuck what y'all trying to pass off as the truth
I done jumped from the earth and touched the Universe's roof
Crash landed back on planet like meteor
Dust off my white tee and lift Lamborghini doors
I keep me a meaty whore
Trini in bikini, apple martini whore
Y'all niggas is CB4
My niggas in CDC
Bounty hunter ECG
Dipping Newports into PCP
Give a mic to me is UFC on Spike TV
Niggas talk gangsta shit but he ain't one
Till he see that gun and realize nobody really love you
Like New York on VH1
I'm the ghetto experiment
Pop in at any son
Me and the project, project, projecting objects at anyone
Blackjack bitches, that's 21
Dare any nigga to be a dollar and see
You want the king of the west then holler at me

[Joell Ortiz]:
Who's been eating? I haven't daddy
Just been the booth's Houdini, working my magic scrappy
Industry jabbing at me
I'm just trying to keep my marriage happy
But the politics and the games driving me crazy like an Arab cabbie
Still I never quit
Def Jam's president, from up the block, around the corner
Down the street, where I'm selling it
Who said, "Joell is sick"?
Man I'm on the deathbed
I wrote this on the bedspread, with IV in my wrist
I am him
The product of a moms who got high and a father who ain't say "bye" to them
His family that is
Know that y'all can never break me
Look in my eyes, listen up guys...don't make me
Only a rookie in the game's eyes
Been doing this since I was yeeh high
It's alright to be shook
I will turn your first album into a library book
C'mon let's skim through the pages in my diary, look
18 I rock those stretchers
19 I dropped a 12 inch
Rawkus Records, that's when I hooked up with G Rap
It's nothing, bang
Y'all heard the streets feedback
At 25 I'm the outcome of everything between that

[Sha Stimuli]:
Y'all know I'm everything y'all want to be
I do the shit you never do
I feel it when you look at me
I'd kill myself if I was you
You
See, but luckily I'm not
I used to run in labels like, "You should fuck with me I'm hot."
By now I could have sold some mills and showed that I was so for real
While your roster fucked around like Lauren Hill's
Let me stop, I ain't hating on nobody
It's like the whole world is waiting on somebody
They say that I'm the obvious replacement
I just say this shit's a hobby
Lot of new rappers waiting in the lobby
But I'm coming up
Me and Joell, do it so well
Niggas either want to throw shells or ride on our coattails
Oh well
Go tell someone I'm coming
I'm sonning niggas without touching they mother
There's no one above me
I told y'all that I was a problem
Rappers started studying me like they could solve it
Listen close
I got a 9 times 5
I pop 3 times 2
Add drama, take away your respect and divide you
In half, for your math I do this til I'm through
Living life, breathing breath, I bring death to your whole crew
I don't know if there's a better MC
Some people get better with time, I say the time's getting better with me
I got, I got my rhymes tight, the streets gave Sha light
Now you see me holding C-Notes like the Chi-Lites
It's The Present motherfucker

[Grafh]:
I got unhappy soldiers, esse that clappy clappy toaster
That turn you brains into nasty tapioca
Ewwww
Then I hop back on over
To drop autograph while I'm autographing a poster
I'm in the cut like
Change stashed in a sofa
I'm Hennessy straight, you a pretty ass glass of mimosa
You a bum, I caught you trying to go half on a soda
You make the change, I use the stash in my loafer
So it don't matter what I pack in a holster
Cause I slash you till I scratch the plaque off the back of your molar
It'll cut through the back of a boulder
Owwww
Got a pack full of soldiers with a bag of explosives
And they clapping them toasters that can detach your back from your shoulders
After I blow your little daughter out the back of her stroller
And the ricochet will blow her back in the stroller
Cause that gat caliber has the motor out the back of a roaster
Vrrrom
Get drunk and try to spaz you joker
Till I punch you in your face and move your back tooth over
I'll knock 'em down your throat
You gag, you choke up
Then I bet by the time your lungs collapse, you sober
Breathe easy
Back don't ya
I'm a crack donor
So my tax write off is a crack smoker
Aaaayyyyye
I ain't battling no one so don't bring a challenger over
If I wanted a challenger I'd battle my poster

[Gab Gotcha]:
I ain't never met a thug that my slugs ain't like
I never met one who lived or walked straight, when they all hit right
Head or the back you parents are attending a mass
Centered around that box wood, lacquered in black
With you you laying stiff in the cushion
While I'm pushing a 'Lac, past the church while your family's looking
Over your face, me driving over the bridge
With coke in a space sealed by placing a switch
If life is a bitch then she fuck me nice
Boxed up for seven joints now she pregnant, bout to birth me yikes
My first born at least, VS1
My seed cultivating, that love grow out of weed and concealed guns
Triple beam lust
Finger fucking them grams that make twins out of one in my hand
My connected weight set me apart
The potential to flood it like when Noah finished building the Ark
Colombian
Moving coke is an art
If Michelangelo was Pablo, Gab Gotcha gotta be Picasso
I rock flows and crush rocks for your nostrils
Clutch Glocks that pop when that blow make you hostile
Parce, cojalo suave, or I unload a clip
And siamese twin your head and the lobby
Silicone tips makes vests sizzle
Implants in your chest like fake tits, holes size of your nipples
Nigga

Gab Gotcha. Crown City nigga[88 Keys]
Yo, this is 88
This is for Amadou Diallo
Rest in peace, you still here

[Fre]
Yo, I'm in a brownstone singin like Brownstone
Bird's eye view of the bodega
No Omega like Rakim
Thinkin about brother Diallo
I find it hard to swallow
Cause 41 is a hard act to follow
Who is it, it can happen tomorrow
Goes down all the time in some African community
This one just hit closer to home
Cause it happened in our backyard
This that *shit* bring us closer to home
They ask "What you writin fo'? What you writin on that paper fo'?"
Don't ask me nothing, just tell me
Who Howard Safir got it safer for, that's why my raps sour
My peoples screamin "Black power!" and "La Raza!"
From the Bronx, police bustin, it's redemption time

[J-Live]
Now on the squad car, CPR's supposed to be the motto
But in they minds, they be like "Yo, I'ma do Diallo"
I guess master's noose was a bitter pill to swallow
Cause nowadays, tips ain't the only things that's hollow
Constitution, 41 more holes in it
And cops swingin sticks like they tryin to win the pennant
And stickin sticks places where they ashamed to admit it
But that's the straw that broke the camel's back
THEY GON' GET IT!!

[Rubix]
Possessed by a nervous twitch and itchy writing finger
41 strokes through the barrel of pen for Amadou
More than a few of my personal friends
Since the beginning, it seems like it never ends
The story, ancient as biblical allegory and it's all gory
The Little Shop of City Hall Horrors
Who bakes infiltrate, agent, provocateur mission statement
Assassinate the Senate candidate, heavenly mandate

[Hook: Mos Def]
We proceeded on a country road
His mother's eyes withered swoll
Her child was never comin home
Said a prayer for his soul
As the coffin had closed, committed to the earth below
First seed she had sewn, would be a tree never grown
Shade that was never known
Who controls the Terrordome, the men with hearts made of stone
Who love only what they own

[Invincible]
Stay on your toes for a troop whose description match
Blue suits, walkin round wit a stick and...
Ready to blast with the wrath of a hollow tip
And the fact is my taxes are scholarship
I feel it in my chest cavity
The only death's apathy, so I change it for who's next after me
And that's the fullest reward
Keep the face of the lost on my bulletin board

[Wordsworth]
Yo yo, it's blue uniform, sirens, names, and badge numbers
Clubs, walkie-talkies, recipes for bad summers
Frisked, pissed after I tuck in my stuff
I really think they just like touchin my *nuts*
What's real stain they thoughts
Swear, but they won't say it in court
All they do is change the report
Riots, tryin to keep the crowd in control
They even got shows, Cops, LAPD, Highway Patrol yo yo

[A.L.]
From the cradle to the grave, they made you a slave
Brainwashed to kill each other, that's the plague that they made
I search em like readin scripts that could save you today
White is right, black is wrong, that's the label they gave
Fryin in hell, applyin jails, they got you dyin in cells
Triple six in the mix, Levine to ?spell?
Prepare for the worst, and try to hope for the best
I take a stare at the hearse, can we cope wit the stress?

[Kofi Taha]
See I live in the land of plungers
Illegal chokeholds and excessive gunshots
Where there's one millionaire for every million empty pot
And Adolf Guili think we static but he's in for a shock
They come wit automatics but we flip it
Use the one, create the four Glocks and while stocks get washed
While school doors get locked and when jobs get blocked
The confi-dence get's rock
And when the welfare's drop into the jails we stock now
After Amadou wrestlin wit freedom tacks my mind into a headlock
But *fuck* H&R, I'm a true cat
Refundin power back to our Blocks

[Hook]

[Tame One]
Good life, you can bubble or struggle
But use your brain muscle if you hustle
Don't let nobody touch you
Don't even trust the ones that trust you
Cause the ones you showin love to might bust you
Seekin as a cancer, my man got shot by Haitians or Jamaicans
Confrontations and school my mind's racin
I pride these sensations over this, now I'm hopin this
We shine for, I never got a chance to rhyme for
My role models sold bottles and stole cars
And when they got locked, I accepted all the phone calls
That's when *niggas* was real
Back before I had a deal
Back when people called Villsburg Hooterville
ILL!!!

[Jane Doe]
My mind wonders on melodic jams
An exotic bird, caged with the rage and the violence of my words
The same things I down I turn around and do
The white cops say nigga, but I say nigga too
Truth be told we hypocrites
In a materialistic society, spirituality shunned or
While young kinds get gunned on
Hibernatin in projects, which you project-ing
The pigs is crucifyin but Africans is resurrectin, Jane Doe

[Grafh]
Pataki, sending cops to come and catch me
He better send a running back to run a track meet
When I'm running through the back streets
The rat teeth of beast loving the black meat
Eatin brothers like our pigment color is that sweet
To lock a man up in prison, the standard of living
Thinking they make a better brand of man
Than the man when he went in
Rub up a man for sinnin
Handcuff his hands to the system, banned from his wisdom
With insanity in him, his mind roams like a cyclone
Damagin victim, his eyes hold savage within him
Wrath with the venom, poison his life
No ointment to boisten the might
If it's on the left, walk to the right
Until death, do your part through your life
Like a boyfriend and wife, because the day times shorter than night
You know?

[Hook]

[88 Keys]
Yo, black is fragile remember that
Cherish everyday
Live life to the fullest, aight?[Intro: Grafh]
Black Hander, Stand up! Boom!

[Hook] x2
Bang Out!

[Grafh]
Holla at ya boy bitch!
Holla may day! may day!
We extort rappers before pay day
And I be on 106 & Park the same day (What!)
Trying to smash Free in front of A.J. (What!)
I hold heaters, it ain't safe (Huh?) (Get that money man)
The chrome nina done got busy like broke phone receivers
(Get that money man)
Blackhanders, stand up (Boom!)
Bitch, rock up cheap
With Knick's the size of Chris Rocks buck teeth (What!)
The clip click, pop up heat (What!)

The only letter we never touch are the D's
(Get that money man)
Get it? Forget it
I'm stuck to the street like gums on my feet
Like uck dat money man, I get it hot man

[Hook] x2

[Grafh]
Hey, hey, hey
We eat that food, you starve when we see that food
I be that dude, that'll rob, you don't need that spoon
Bite the bullet with your weak ass tooth
The heat blast, you fade like a cheap tattoo, you bitch
(Get that money man)
You see that (Woot! Woot!)
Well we can't move
(Get that money man)
I got your girl in my jag drop (What?)
She's my brand new stash box
All in her purse I stash the Glock
We ride right pass the cops like (Vroom!)
Like an express train flying pass your stock
(Get that money man)
Ask not, I be back on the block
Reppin my team like a Mascot (Holla Back!)

[Hook] x2

[Grafh]
Hey, hey
When I'm up, I grind till my time's up
Till the sun shine up, I'm grindin' for mine (What!)
In my momma's kitchen trying to chop dimes up
Until the cops chop my moms up in a line up (What!)
If you need it, then sign up, sign up!
And please don't ask for a dime for five bucks
(Get that money man) Nah
And you wonder why I strive for the bus
Cause now they charge me like $1.25 for a dutch (What!)
I live by the sword and die in a cut
I die when it cuts, I'm a ridah
But who the fuck else gon' supply my lunch?
Huh, Huh (Get that money man)
Ok, I'm a grind till the swine provide the cuffs, bitch!
(Get that money man)[VERSE 1: Joell Ortiz]

[VERSE 2: Scram Jones]

[VERSE 3: Nino Bless]
Baby there's a shark in the water
Named BLESS, upstaging the top performers
Was there from the start of the slaughter
When I go off like a shot from a sawed off, this was the cocked warning, sort off*
Eh eh eh, hands off this shit
I'll off you, QUICK as the black dude in a horror flick
This, artist spits SARS every song I rip
Got fans coming out the blue like some former Crips
I'm from the corner strip, that’s lawless
You be an informant, eating lunch with officers feeding the sergeant tips
HEART, of a martyr, shit these bars I spit
Are like folks related fucking, they just come out retarded kid*
I'm guarded with an arm looking like cable in the X Force
You less than a pawn, you a checkers piece on my chessboard
N.I.N.O, real heads know
I go, harder than acid trippers bopping to techno (whoa)

[VERSE 4: Grafh][Produced By: Prestige]

[Intro: Chris Webby]
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Dopamine, dopamine
That I'm on, that I want
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Dopamine, dopamine

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
See dopamine is what your brain is makin' when your feelin' happy
So, if your tryna' feel what I'm feelin' then yo get at me
And me? I get me fix from all sorts of shit
Every night a glass of milk with some Oreo's I can dip
Fresh pot of mom's sauce, macaroni, meatballs
That smell of Sour Diesel when I open up the jar
Break it up and rollin' somethin', breakin' off a ho I'm fuckin'
Pop a little ecstasy and get that serotonin pumpin'
Goin' commando in a pair of sweats
Reruns of Sopranos up on my TV set
And that dopamine be flowin' on stage
Feel it every time that shit is goin' my way
It's chillin' with your best homies
The spittin' game, it's gettin' laid and it's that after sex bogie
Any time you feelin' good, it's what your brain produces
So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's supposed to be
And that's the shit that I'm on, that's the shit that I want
Whether I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
That bamma weed you smokin', ain't fuckin' with the OG
I hit it till I'm coughing, I hit it often
I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge because I know the ledge
I wake up when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin', I'm bounty huntin' like I'm Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, we born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Now why do I expose these niggas'? I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical warnings, gettin' as gory as biblical stories, you  ignoring the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene
You ever live the life of a heretic?
That, dopamine, from the smoke the coke the lean, is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
I'm just tryna' get my fix

[Verse 3: Grafh]
Bitch on my lap, gyratin'
Loud so loud, my lungs vibratin'
High as a bitch I'm up skyscappin'
Annihilatin' some kind of Sanaa Lathan
That's the feelin' I feel when I am creatin'
And the fire's escapin', though your fire escape
Until I lie in your basement
Arise in the pavement just to arrive from inside of a spaceship
That fix, I'm suppose to dream
I chase Hennessy with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober
Promethazine in my soda, I'm supposed ta lean
My momma cookin'? Encore
The family members I die for
The two beautiful kids that I stay alive for
Plus Hip-Hop makes me feel alive more
That fix

[Hook: Chris Webby]

[Verse 4: B-Real]
Let me put you down, with some realness
You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
We're the feelin' that you get when you open up your bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
We're the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelled it
We the vibe at the party, when that shit's about to turn up
We the "hell ya", ya thinkin' when the dabs about to burn up
The fist pump, bitch I'm number one, I'm the winna' by the
Toast at the table when we celebrating [?]
Roar of the crowd when ya see something amazing
We're the thrill of victory, we're the felling of elation
It's a presentation and we hope you see
You're in need of that dopamine

[Bridge: Chris Webby]

[Verse 5: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, Truth spit game, murda'
Shoulda' been cased on it
Causing panic, 9-11 shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, knowing they woman' face on it
Money long, snakes, givin' a open chase on it
I'm fully sober, my fix is chicks and change
And ridin' lookin' amazing in something so strange
I hit the hood, just to kick it with homies
Knowing they need it for support, everyone left 'em lonely
I do my best to dodge the phoney, cuz' I don't understand them
And I ain't tryin'
I'm the truth and I don't fuck with that lyin'
Stay from beside 'em
Hit the studio to blackout, every track gettin' packed out
Just like somebody woman as soon as I blow her back out
Might just give a laugh as I proceed to knock a track out
And burn off with my speakers in the trunk, who tryna' act out?
Say Watson tell Boogz I'm on my turn up
Get [tightest?] in them [?], meet me at Dreams, we bout to turn up

[Hook: Chris Webby][Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Yo Kendrick you inspired me man, lets go
Yeah, visions of Che Guevara just staring at me
A fifth of people but legislation is barely Latin
Yea, we got a handful of senators but no president (nah)
'Cuz the politicians ain't acting like representatives (nah)
And they send the census in to check on us and then censor us
They see us all as illegals, white people keep on resenting us
They build that tension up in your mayday, on that May day
Officers sought melees and they kicking us with their pay-lays
And the pay days ain't racking killing us like some pioneers
Open fire like cowards, aggression is just a sign of fear
And they shot an immigrant dead, I seen him just lying there
And another one hit in the head they don't even try and care
Indentured servants, living conditions worsen
Got us waiting inside of Home Depot to see who working
Who do you think picks all them vegetables that you purchase?
Ten of us in tenements trembling with no furnace
Construction workers, house keepers and servants
Mommy got a degree but she works with laundry detergent
And Latin businessmen harassed by all the minute-men
You from the third-world then you a second class citizen
If your black or brown and them racist judges ain't backing down
And if you refuse them, the you get bruises from there abuses then they smack us 'round
And the want to love our food and our women, but hate our Spanish sound
They don't want us in school with they children, they kick our asses out
They're kind of missing the modern sense of the races
First the C.I.A will come and then the corporations
And then the U.S puppet, government inauguration
They rape our resources and exploit us for our labor
We flee into the states in search for better lives and wages
And work below the minimum because they don't got to pay us, right
We getting sick but we dont get no medication
We stay out of the hospitals avoiding deportation
So I ain't funding no IRS, why invest in that INS
When they want to see us all lying dead
And the cartels'll run by the feds?
The War on Drugs is just a war on us
So authorities can horde us up and keep the borders boarded shut
They makin sure they get their cut and that they caking
A flat bed truck is just a modern day slave ship
They make more paper if their workers got no papers
And they ship us off before we plead our cases because they got Hiiipower
Fuck we supposed to look up to man, George Lopez?
Get the fuck out of here

[Verse 2: Grafh]
Uh, yeah, visions of Martin Luther looking at me
'Cuz he had a dream and it as it seems I had a dream
But mines flooded with demons dreaming they should attack me
While I look at Michelle and Obama looking happy
I got the same smile he got
Called him the kettle black
Nah I'm talking about a tea pot
Anything for the nigga especially anything we got
Them walls look strong, them shits is made of sheetrock
Nigga you can't suit and tie me
I'm Huey Newton, you trying to do karate
While I'm shootin' shottys, you stupid, is you on Mollys?
I'm ruthless, assume a cum laude went to school just to party
The truest and found the Illuminati in the student body
I'll assume their probably using computers to crucify me (Judas)
The Giuliani's, you and Romney finna work it out, do pilates
Stretch cutie (yep) until the feds shoot me
If u don't like what I said, sue me
White cops beat a black mans ass, they dont get fired
They get demoted to death duty, yes truly, they pussy
They probably rock a vest to watch a Wild-Wild West movie
The hood is the stage but the sound check tooleys
What used to be nooses are now neck jewelries
And I still got my chains on
Just another statistic or just another Trayvon
Just another beat for me to talk about race on
Just another nigga trying to pull the racecard
Just another flashy ass rapper in a racecar
Fresh to death, best dressed in the graveyard, work it mama!
Black girl, you don't even focus
You want to model, but all you show is emotions
The insecurities showing all of your poses
Your such a beautiful soul and you don't even notice
You don't even know this
But white girls on the magazines make black girls one point of your noses
This is where the truth drops
I ain't good for all of the self esteem issues you got
When I'm trying get your boots knocked
Butt-ass naked in tube socks
But you ain't looking for truth
You on Google looking for 2Pac
You too distracted, the feeling of feeling inadequate
You adapted, you need me to tell you you attractive
Baby, I've been a victim of racism
This cop told me I'd probably make great chicken
And I'd look great in that upstate prison
I wanted to spit in his face
But then he gripped the thing on his waste
And I had became the victim
Change the game if you can't change the system
Think bigger, think smarter, get gudda
I never hate I lust to indulge in culture
I could love any creative way, I love my brotha
But black is beauty and that's my color and that's hiiipower
Baby, that's hiiipower"1, 2, 3, 4" 10x

Where there's one millionaire for every billion empty pot
And Adolf Guily think we static but he's in for a shock
They come wit automatics but we flip it
Use the one, create the four Glocks and while stocks get washed
While school doors get locked and when jobs get blocked
The confi-dence get's rock
And when the welfares drop into the jails we stock now
After Amadou wrestlin wit freedom tacks my mind into a headlock
But *fuck* H&R, I'm a true cat
Refundin power back to our Blocks

Chorus

[Tame One]
Good life, you can bubble or struggle
Use your brain muscle if you hustle
Don't let nobody touch you
Don't even trust the ones that trust you
Cuz the ones you showin love to might bust
Seekin as a cancer, my man got shot by Haitians or Jamaicans
? wit confrontations and school my mind's racin
I pride these sensations over this, now I'm hopin this
We shine for, I never got a chance to rhyme for
My role models sold bottles and stole cars
And when they got locked, I accepted all the phone calls
That's when *niggas* was real
Back before I had a deal
Back when people called Villsburg Hooterville
ILL!!!

[Jane Doe]
My mind wonders on melodic jams
An exotic bird, caged wit the rage and the violence of my words
The same things I down I turn around and do
The white cops say *Fuck you* but I say *Fuck you too!*
Truth be totally hypocrites
And materialistic society, spirituality shunned or
While young kinds get gunned on
Hibernatin in projects, which you project-ing
The pigs is crucifyin but Africans is resurrectin, Jane Doe

[Grafh]
Battacky, sends cops to come and catch me
He better send a runnin back to run and track me
When I'm runnin through the back streets
The rat teeth of beast lovin to black me
Eatin brothers like a picinic color cuz that's sweet
To lock a man up in prison, the standard of livin
Thinkin they make a better bred of man
Than the man when he went in
Rub up a man for sinnin
Handcuff his hands to the system, banned from his wisdom
Wit insanity in him, his mind roams wit like a cyclone
Damagin victim, his eyes hold savage within him
Wrath wit the venom, poison his life
No ointment to boisten the might
If it's on the left, walk to the right
Until death, do your part do your life
Like a boyfriend and wife, because the day times shorter than night
You know?

Chorus

[88 Keys]
Yo, black is fragile remember that
Cherish everyday
Live life to the fullest, aight?[Verse 1]
I wouldn't care if you was a cheap broad that lean by the bar
You and 3 broads drinking one drink with 3 straws
Like retards Siamese linked with 3 arms
Just be smart sweetheart holla at me
I don't care if ur shoes is on your jewels and charms
Your Gucci is on and your Louis Vuitton, whatever
You lil cute lil movie star I don't care
I don't give a damn what you don't wear, sugar
What's up with that them jeans are nice
I want to know what's under that
From the front to the back, I'm gutter
Try hump hump hump from the back
Like we in the first grade again, baby
I'm on that same BS that I always be on
I pump hardcore you want some R & B songs
I'm far and beyond and on, ah I'm crucial
I am what you are not used to, it's GR!

[Hook]
If you broke as a joke girl (I don't care)
Be yourself home girl (I don't care)
You ain't got to front with me girl
(I don't care, I don't care, and I don't care)

[Verse 2]
I don't care what you wears; under I don't care if you got a weave
Just make sure that it match your hair color
I don't care if your nails are real or acrylic
Cause when they scratch my back I'm still gon feel it
Still gon hit in fact I lay it good
Busting like a cop in a black neighborhood
Hate to see you independent black like myself
That's why I don't hesitate to act like myself
I rap like myself these rappers are so but
They don't pull weight they like broke up tow trucks
So pass the mic now I'm ahead of my time
So these parasites can live off my after life now
So why would I care about your punk ass jewels
When I'm still in the same hood you can't come back to
I like your rims look how they spun back (oooh!)
When I get your car jack you can run that too

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3]
I don't care how many times y'all been to jail
You sound like a snitch and I think you're frail
I think y'all fail I choose to fix them
If you got shot don't brag Homie you the victim
Now I don't care if you a straight veteran ask your fans
All the songs you makes I freestyle way better than them
Sick, I hate medicine I came to hurt you
I look butt dirty you way commercial
I spit on your stage rehearsal I'm sick
My album is like one long Aids commercial (yuck!)
I'ma take your worst nightmare
Divide it by fair and multiply it by 9 squared
I'm made up what your afraid of I'm here
When your nerves get to jumping and you know I'm there
I don't care if y'all ain't ready for the real
I'm the golden child I done drained the water that Eddy couldn't spill

[Hook] - 2X

I don't care, I don't care, I don't care I don't care I don't care[Hook][Ginuwine & Grafh]

Repeat x2[Hook 2X: Royce Da 5'9"]
I fuck with niggas that murder
They do the type of shit you ain't heard of
Divide a nigga clique with the burner
It's all about ahhhhhh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahhhhhh-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm like Socrates
So to assume is to make an ass out of you fast after you drop to me
Look at the word, that's a suit, that's what you would do
Choo-choo train handguns, do your crew
I squeeze while I'm lookin at you
Cause you made a mistake like my nigga Crooked I's tattoo
I'm the answer - you niggas is candy
Ya heart pump blood yet smell like a Jolly Rancher
While I'm lampin in my mansion with my private dancer
My man's outside of your house, my hired campers
I ain't the hardest nigga in the world
All I know is if you love me and know me you know I

[Hook]

[Grafh]
Yup, you know I fucks with them niggas that murder
They trigger finger's itchy when they grippin them burners
I am not a 9-to-5'er, I don't sit with them workers
Nigga I was flippin work while you was flippin them burgers
But I used to work in offices, now I'm the president
I'm where the Oval Office is but I don't roll with officers
I roll with loaded cartidges, don't know what law enforcement is
I know, I was marvelous, the road is like an orphanage
I blow and explode because I'm the arsonist, unloadin where the target is
I throw, gang signs when I pose for photographers
You don't know what the motto is, it's death before dishonor
Black Hand President, I's elected before Obama
I'da ran

Grafh got 'em
Life’s a bitch with ass shots mad rotten but I’m still back shotin
Still back boxing in back of the trap Chopin off track jogging with the city on my back squatin'
I'm Sashsquatching and squashing
I beat them into a pizza and add topping
I got em all runnin back hoping faster than Joe Budden have model broads coming back blogging
(Stop)
As soon as she tweets a fuckin cab stopping
I dead her as soon as she plug her laptop in ugh
Ooh boy
I got the game sewn tighter than the pants on a new boy
True story y'all expected me to fall
I am in the building with asbestos in the walls
I’m stepping on your arms then I put my heel under your elbow and lean on it while I’m stepping on your palm
(Snap)
Nigga I represent New York City
The whole world in my hand like two small titties
In a two door coupe with the roof all pretty
And my rim got my tires lookin' Snoop Dogg skinny
Gone

Go head you try it with a insider
Riot inciter
Who ever think they eating who the diet get applied to I
Show them the cal and how behemoth it be
To you it’s a war
It’s just disagreement to me
I’m a behemoth on the cement when you see him fix yo tone up
I’m coke infested semen all grown up
But when I’m talkin week that means I’m poppin out in Vegas
Move in my own rhythm you won’t spot it on the play list like
They shootin', I mean
Watch them all clear
Finding a shell will be like a needle in Ross' beard
But that was back in my so broke days
Now I don’t even text back if she don’t go both ways
Even then when they drop those draws don’t know if it’s the cargos I wore
Or the Murciélago's doors
Back by the fire pit eating charcoaled s'mores
I’m masturbating with my brain plot hardcore scores
I’m mime not a goon
I got every indication that I be on top soon-
The crib came with a stock room
So here a jewel to those mocking my craft
Can’t tell them my stock raising if you’re ain't watching the Grafh

Nigga this is my block, Name a nigga who run me out

Son, my gun'll bring a playboy bunny out
Somebody gotta die, I'm a try ya hunny out
Send her to ER with half her tummy out
No C-section, no infants comin out
She can't have babies again
Me and Kay gettin money so its feelin like the eighties again
Holla!

[Shells]
Ayo, You boys is silly, I'm next since Pac and Biggie
And I'm Bout Major Figgas like Dutch and Gillie
Catch Shells all-star weekend down in Philly
On my hip, pack heat like a bowl of chilly
Look - I Clap milli's, act willy, you a chump
Only kid in the hood with elevators in his truck
See, I flash bucks, rock all black doors
And my watch ice'd out like Jacobs store
When you boys gon learn I got this game lock
What you got for your deal, I spent on X-Box
Keep frontin like you hungry, I'm a feed you a biscuit
I got rock and roll bullets, leave limps like bizkit
So hey, its ya life involved - act like it is
My chain light gray like trash can lids
If one of yall take my chain - none of yall live
You like, "I ain't do it Shells", One of yall did!

[Grafh]
Cause A lot of yall are fakin', one minute is As-salamu alaykum
2 minutes later is where's my salami bacon
Niggas swear the product they makin' requires rockin an aprin
They liars cause its Betty Crocker they bakin
Not that I'm sayin that I Cook, Cause I dont
I keep it as raw as you seen it before it was put on the boat
The hookers'll open they jaw for free
Fuck being a gentleman, ya girlfriend open the door for me
When a pimp walk the beat, you shut up one day
The day the dick had ya mother next up one way
I come up one way drunk pushin a porshe
Make beef and I'm cookin the sauce - Gravy!
I be lookin like a boss
I pop at ya hood on ya snorkle til I have the fur lookin like a scarf
Lookin like I robbed 'em
Tell cops is easy to find like chinks in a nail shop
Holla, cheah!

[Cassidy]
Ayo, get back get back for I click clack click clack
Where that shit at? Get that 'for I bust shots!
Get crunk if you want to, drunk if you want to
Front if you want to, And get slumped with the gun too
Gimme mine cause any time I could run through
And put ya brains on the mini blinds in sun roof
Try run dog, you can try hide man
But when I bust the gun dog, you gon die man
I drinkin rum dog and I'm gettin high man
Say good bye man or a prayer - "Aman"
Look It ain't hard to get at you dudes

I got it locked from Illadelph to ATL
The wait is over, I'm a take it over
I'm a bubble like vinegar and baking soda
Easy!

[Jae Hood]
Ayo, I'm a D-Block nigga - I don't respect wack rhymes
If you had a gat in a clock, you couldn't kill time
Yall cowards don't want beef, why even start?
Yall like dicks in the pool - none of yall hard
Come thru in the spit white 330 with a mean birdie
Holdin my hammer cause she know its dirty
You got questions, holla at me - I tell you whats what
Lay you on ya back and yall chumps'll really see whats up
On the real, yall niggas better chill
Think ya crew spittin flames - I'll put ya hot dogs on the grill
It gotta be a conspiracy if niggas ain't feelin me
Like a nigga with no eyes - yall not seein me
Call me a director - I give clips to ya broad
Bullets is like gum - How they stick in ya jaw
Go 'head, call the narcs - I put a hole thru ya heart
And leave you on the train tracks in a shopping cart
This ain't just beats and bars, Its things i'll do to you
In Compton fuck, I'm tryin to get through to you
The gauge'll open ya chest like vics
How you went from being soft to hard - niggas is dicks

Liars get shot in they tongue - I'll put the mack to ya throat motherfucker!Uhhm uhhm Attention, Attention Please
Attention you, yea you, you too. Shut the f#ck up!
Ladies n gentleman, boys and girls
Niggas n bitches
I think that boy Grafh has officially lost his f#cking mind
His a mad man I tell you

You’re easy to ignore, believe me you’re a bore
Believe me I can sleep to you when you speak to me I snore
I treat them like a whore that I bee seeing on a tour
I’m just skeeting and leaving all they seeing is the door
I’m just skeeting and leaving all the semen on the floor
Then I cleaned it with your draws wit ma sneakers on your bra
Eeny miny moe ee ny eeny miny moe
Tity with it tiny whores, fit them in em tiny draws
See me I like it more when they feed into me raw
I am greedy, I am sure, life is my amor
Life is hard, life is odd, life’s like a lightning rod
Fight with god I did it twice nimrod
Life’s a light skin broad that might ménage twice with the right massage, ooh
She like it all night in your wife's garage
And my pipe’s quite large so your wife might barf
Waiting for me to feed her then your wife might starve
Boom, nightmare, night lights off, night night on
And fight night so running your wife tights bra w
With your wife tight on, take flight like dawn
My life’s like Mars
I’m under this world look bright light stars, wow
I bite like sharks
You little bitty bitches ain’t quite like jaws
You little niggers butcher little light by ball
This way the killers put your little type right …
I type right old type right to the mall
Just make sure you spell my name right on your blog
With a f
Nigger I see you right through your blog
My every ready study shine light through the fog
Then about the forming the rap they forming this flat
Time is money all the informers is back
I take all of that ask the informers and the rats
I baseball your hat off the corner with a bat
I slaughter it, all of it cause all of it is whack
Then I tossed in the water but the formal of a crack
Then I … pack all the … is packed
Then I tossed it in the coffin and performed in it a rap
Get the audience attack but I’m all on it
It’s on again I clap, I can strapper than a cardian …
Travel to your cardian, I’m smashing up your daughter while she travel with a guardian
I crash to your party and I’m looking for a virgin
That can splat my …
I’m bigger than a hit record
All night I drink liquor till I piss breakfast
I need an ale …deliver the message
Not the ale I said … lexus
Whip my woman I said they … exes
I’m chauvinistic whip…I’m sexist
I go ballistic when I’m …
…when they beginning the sketches
They been in the checkers, they’ve been in the catchers
Catch this (spits)
I’m sick and affectuous, I’m living with spirit delivering hexes
The devil’s sending me venom that’s dipped in as-bestus
And then he send me to heaven to scribble a message
I wrote 6 sixes and I’m scribbling the x es
I can’t read it, what does it say, oh no
I’m chucky who wanna play

This time you lucky, I got the bride of chucky
And all my shirt stain amount …
I slide in a vagina, kinda comfy
Half metal, they kinda look kinda rusty
Half ghetto, kinda look kinda ugly
She was climbing on my waist trying to climb above me
She dropped it on my face kinda clumsy
I was hit before Mike Jack got a monkey
That’s why Osama bin laden been trying to duck me
Tell Obama we divide an entire country
Half for him, half for me, he could run it after me
The feds are coming, after me
Cause I’m the missing letter that come after z
My heart pump lava plus half a key
Bud, hash n E plus gasoline
Doctor, what ever happened to me
Whatever happened is happen to be, it doesn’t matter to me
Juliette, what a catastrophy, I’m not Romeo like the sun from Master P
I just like the son dumb bastards
I’m just like the sun, unpack the heat
So punk, you should run for sun glasses
Or get your punk ass and …pass the street, what
Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon
Roar, roar like a dungeon dragon
Roar, roar like a dungeon dragon
Stop, I breathe fire me I’m a dungeon dragon
But I’m drunk and stagnant all the … are laughing
When I’m puff puff passing a bunch of magic
I rap cocky I do a bunch of bragging
About the … jewelry and a bunch of fashion, see
Gucci put g’s on a bunch of fabrics
I do it on tonight got a bunch of swags
And a bunch of rags that all come with tags
And 100 bags stuffed with stuff to match it
A hundred grand stuffed in a comfy mattress
I cut the hands up if you come to grab it
My underwear be coming with a bunch of magnums
I fuck them dump them punch them gag them
I shoot snuff porn jump and stab them
Cut them up and stuff them in a luggage then drag them
Then I tie the suitcase to the front of a wagon
Then I play chicken with a hummer and crush them
Then I burn rubber till I turn rubber to ashes
And then it burn under dirt covered with acid
And 5 tons of gas, police found you crying …
…up in a casket, fried up from like 500 matches
I’m boxing, I’m fighting 500 matches

My kitchen full of fireflies stop the magnets
No food in it, just bananas, go to hard knox
I come with the … but I drop that still came up with them assets
Trying to get lucky, fuck the madness
I cut a couple feet of a bunch of rabbits
Bunch of maggots …some baskets
Making up a plastic, ready one package, ewww
Damn, Grafh going on, why he rappin like that?
He showing off, lights on bright now
They going off
A stock up jackass and they know it all
Got a title belt but she never show it off
I don’t ever care about it I throw it off
Douche bag bench should have crowned me
I rap better than the best rap in your county
Hate the rap game and I’m rapping in around me
I hula … until the bag … surround me
I’m back to the dungeon dragon
…but I got a pumpkin hanging from my … thing
…cause I’m a vampire with a bunch of fangs that would cut your fingers off
Plus my elephant’s … orangutan not just hanging
I’m a monster, I bust the … while you stuck up in the closet with a bunch of hangers
A one night stand, hump is train this
And I’m running next door so I could hump your neighbors
Hump hump and away, plus they stay chained with hand cuffs and tasers
Cause when I get freaky and off this danger
You ever had your little nipples sucked with lasers?
That’s just for players, I show you what game is
Bitch let’s fuck, I’m famous
I got it feeling like a bunch of razors
My dick get hard enough to cut potatoes
Let’s role play, come dressed up as a waitress
While I stuff tomatoes up your anus
That comes on a plate with one steak fish
Some cake mixed up with lunch that I ate it
Yumm, your friend want some? Taste it
That’s how feel when you’re fucking the greatest
That’s how feel when you’re stuck in the matrix
Stuck in the basement, under the pavement
Life is a bitch, I’m coming to rape it
But this is porn so whenever you suck it I tape it, ok? Hey

[Still editing..][Verse 1: Grafh]
Gudda
Yeah (boom boom boom)
Yeah (I wanna set..)
Yeah (boom boom boom), Yeah
Huh, I'm live screaming from the underground
Get up under your skin 'til I push the blood around
I'm at your baby momma crib pushin your son around
If the world was mine I'd be pushin the sun around
Gold dust in this chain, let it twinkle
It look bright in the light when I let it sprinkle
This is not rap money, thats why its crooked and wrinkled
Cause I was pushin my work instead of pushin my single
This is raw, so holla at me if you need it cheaper
I speak crack, holla at me if you need a feature
This that sizzurp, nigga who need a leader
My car foreign, my engine need a visa
The nickel millimeter trigger need a fever (hot..)
The refer that I deliver need a speaker
Loud, hot copper, top shotta
I punch niggas in their snort locker (wadup?!..)

[Hook: Grafh]
We in this thang
We in it good
We out shit out
We in the hood
Them boys hunt
They in the woods
That red dot on your head, that ain't good, zip em up
Put em on their ass now, zip em up
Feel em with Tabasco, zip em up
Bring another toe tag, zip em up
Bring another body bag, zip em up
Body Bag em, I zip em up (x4)

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Grafh Wadup
I'll zip em up.. Ghost
Body bag, DOA ADHD nigga letting the heater spray
Coo coo, no clock
The four pound then the Glock'll make the show stop
Put a bullet in your bitch like Botox
Before you get robbed, get gun butted and throat chopped
Wolves here
Alpha male rep for the G niggas inside and out of jail
[?] on ..and .. [?] on
King Pin jeans when niggas had their Levis on
Body bag, toe tag
Mirk em and forget about em, end of the smoke bag
I'll rip em up, knock em out, pick em up
I'll stick em up, clip em up, hit em up
Body bag, niggas better zip em up
Ghost put em down, bet you can't pick em up

[Hook: Grafh]

[Verse 3: Loaded Lux]
Vital lines that'll pleasant doctors
The shots I throw hot as Russian vodkas
Its hard to withhold they came cold and stuffed in lockers
My art gothics in the age of forgotten logic
Getting these pockets high as white chicks scary flick octaves
I'm fine vintage, the life is just dying with us
Mind wicked, a few thoughts will kill a nigga wit nine endings
My kind ended off with the loss of John Lennon
When human minds didn't recognize the reflection was God's image
Life vengeance for vengeance, get your hinges kicked in shin
Then go up top to the chin
Thats how we get it in, when your doors rushed
Another screw ball's clutched in my vice grip
And the wrong turn to get your life stripped
Sit tight, listen to dawg on it with God on it
This knife split whatever fall on it, I'm for-warning
This how killers hunt, my style's draft out, you witness Lux
Might call K-Shine to zip you up!

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Yeaaahhh now get up out ya seat this hi-hop

This Levis Nike boots hoodi socks

But we ain't playin baseball with them wooden bats

This Yonkers Harlem this by any means
Don Gorilla the don don the bron bron
I Told you i murder whatever im on
This hoop di music this limo tinted
This two or three burners in a dirty rented
This brown liquor this ace of spades
This petron and pineapple my lemonade
This nobody safe here everyday they raid

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Grafh]
Where the cash at? Where the cash at?
You lookin at the future fuck where the past at?
Im lookin at yo peep ho where the class at?
We standing at yo momma crib where the grass at?
I drop one bomb where the grass at?
Where the trash can go? where the trash at?
Hit'em with a oh! Where the gangstas spit those hollows
They in the club with me with them big ol bottles
Big ol hammers with them big ol nozzles
Fuck a size one where my nigga big ol models?
With big ol asses the show dont stop
Oh no ya whole gangsta is photo shoped
Homo block doedoe so the poepoe watch
Doedoe i flood the hall to ya polo top
Logo black all iron and robocop
Or the 44 thatll blow a hole in ya top[Intro]
Rrrr...
Ay Ay.. My name Grafh ya'll
Wadup ugn! (Boom!) Team Bang Boy

[Hook]
Ain't nobody fucking with my click, click, click click (Pow)
Paparazzi see a nigga and they flick, flick, flick flick (Say cheese)
When your bitch come near ma zipper, it go zip, zip, zip, ziiiiip
Nigga they want the
They want the
The-the-the they want the

[Verse: Grafh]
Playing strip poker at your mom's house
I be in the Gucci store, playing dollhouse
Play em all out, they playing catch up
I be in the louie store playing dress up (nice..)
Pay a check up and I'm easy to talk with
I'm young fly and I'm fresh, easy to market
The label say I need me a marker
I say I'm good with the street, to make it comfy
All I need is a car pit
Each other label, all I need is a target
I put hands and feet on your artists
And beat them retarded, I'm off the leash and I start shit
Yes I did it, this isn't a test drive, is it? (F nah!)
Yes I'm with it & the chances of seeing me
It's like seeing lil wayne in a NY fitted
I chef I whip it (arrggh)
The great rhythm, I'm in the kitchen whipping the white, racism (Ohh)
Pump weight, living uncut baked chicken
Up late, ducking upstate prison
Come fuck with me, couple energy niggas don't wanna fuck with me, (who?)
I get one of them robbed if I don't come up quickly
Look, industry fuck boy, you stuck with me
What if I put one of your names in a rap
And call you all kinds of names in a rap
I don't know who to choose
I should just put all of your names in a hat
And come to your state and turn you into a stain on a nap
I'll abuse you, get the whippin on you
I had a blog saying, why that nigga picking on you
The infrared dot on your head and it's sticking on you
I knock the bitch off of your lap while she strippin on you
Nigga shooting fair one, I'm talking mano in mano
I'm on my Big Sean, I make it y'all wobbly wobble
Wobbly wobble, wobbly wobble, your bitch be sucking me empty
I mean she swallow me hollow, I mean she probably goggle
I don't never respect them, my bitches going both ways
I never direct em, Put em in bed & I stretch em
I take them legs and I bend them, and spread them like an antenna
When I need better reception I be the predator catching my prey
Wit all this bait on, ice hit the leather, look like I'm snapping the crayon
Colors busting out it's just what you happen to skate on
Dead presidents, my wallet happen to stay on
Dead president, I pray for no drama
I look in my wallet and pray for Obama
Argh, you better act your age
Don't go broke, tryina look rich, act your wage
Tell your bitch I might lick her, she might have to shave
Team Bang Boys, that's the way, if you see me, oh[Intro] [Apathy talking]
(Yo) yeah, yo. I don't know what song I'm gonna do (check)
But my man Unknown told me to rip this motherfucker
(Yo Apathy), so I'm gonna rip this motherfucker

[Verse One] [Apathy]
I ain't the type to trick for chicks or lick their clits
I make 'em grip the dick in the whip and strip for chips
Treat a bitch like a foe, givin' hoes no doe
With pros I never snooze, I consume No-Doz
If they're poppin' that trash then I'm droppin' 'em fast
Then put 'em in a body cast with an oxygen mask
I'm the bitch whipper, clip gripper, chick sticker, clit licker
Sip liquor, spit quicker, flip sicker, scrips ricochet, hit a brick
Stray bullet split tips of those Bics that you grip when you writin' wack shit
I can split molecules like the body of blunts
And karate punch you punks leave your bodies in chunks
I char flesh and scar chests like porn stars breasts
To find a squad that could test, you're hard pressed
I'll spit a rap to knock mics out like little mac
And fit a little metal cap right inside your fitted cap
If you spit again I'm slippin' in your little sister's school
And have her sniffin' Ritalin and make her grab my dick again
And stick it in until I split that little kinky bitch in two
And you ain't eve seen my finishin' move

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Don't even ask for me
Go ahead and ask for "Trouble"
I'm known to push back wigs and pull the extensions on your chick
Unknown & Mek asked me to spit some shit
So I calculated the accurate style to come with
You better be fully equipped with equipment
That's powerful enough to polarize the Earth and bend it
Off it's axis
My acronym is a mystery
My arch nemesis is shooken, can't even look at me
Start the day right
Bullets and milk is my breakfast
I fuck the type of bitches that make Dolly Parton look breastless
This is the raw nigga rap shit
With incredible action and drama, my suspenseful persona
Is honored among thieves, so son please
You can get your guns even
And suck on these M1's that's heat seakin'
The Celph Titled legacy will live long
I put planets on my back and hold quasars in my palm
Fuck a laxative I'll beat the shit out you
And if you a pregnant bitch I'll beat the kid out you
I hope your headphones are airbag efficient
Cause when I drop science the impact is imminent

[Verse Three] [Grafh]
Guess who?
Don't guess you
No one meant you or the homo's that co-defend you
I hope it offends you
I'm on the low with the hoes that I sex through
I could have got your sister pregnant
You wouldn't know I know your nephew
Gangsta
Banger automatic mode, tec shoot
I don't care if it's beef with the clique, I'm goin' to get you
I'm goin' against you and everything that you 'bout
And every nigga that be bringin' you out
Fuck 'em
Fuck their label
Not signed yet? Then fuck your block
Suck my cock, I'm next
No, AT&T, I reach out and touch, nah next
I reach out and bust my nine X
That's why smart niggas elevate they mind
And dumb niggas get slugs in 'em that'll elevate they mind
Slugs in they back that'll elevate they spine
Lift their chain over their face and elevate they shine
Once they faint, elevate they shine
Without they ice grill they pussy, but with their game face they fine
That's why I add my two cents and loose change they mind
And take every game face they find and un-thug it
You got a mic in The Source, I un-plug it
If you don't like it when I fight with the four then run from it, dick[Intro]
Pull it pull it, Hey!
Pull it pull it, Pull it
Pull it pull it, Hey
Pull it pull it, Pull it!
Pull it Pull it, Hey!
Pull it Pull it, Pull it!

Dead prezzys on my dinner table, blood type is greedy
Black tints, black shades on, they don’t see me
I’m greedy, it’s money on my knife and fork
Money’s speaking for me, I don’t like to talk

[Verse 1 – Chinx]
Roll around in that ride, deuces on that drop thing
Rolling out of my mind, a noose is what that guap mean
Pac man, eat your money up
Snowflake, pink toes, she just got her tummy tucked
BS is on my arm, pills up in that man capsule
Talking on that bum, little mama let em feel [?]
You need culture, on this side we get you focused
Now kick off them Louis loafers, life’s a trip, I get you chauffeured
Never on your A game, whole life on that B shit
These niggas talking but won’t walk up on that cement
Chinx Drugz, I’m a, I’m a coke boy
Fuck these niggas talking, I got money on my phone, boy

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Grafh]
I got money all on my mind
My money all about more bread
Put money all in your mind
Put money all in your forehead
Jumping out of my Corvette
You be the nigga I skate past
You be the nigga that ain’t next
I don’t need no motherfucking brake pad
I stay past, your fake ass ain’t even in my weight class
I body slam linebackers out they face mask
Talking all of that bullshit
Talking all of that full clip
Talking all of that sheep crap
Talking all of that wool shit
I’m talking all of that wolf shit, drinking out the bottle
My middle finger up, it just came up out of motto
My pocket full of green look like I’m spending avocado
I got beef [?]  like the lettuce in my taco

Why don't you hug me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you hold me?
My heart break!
Why do you hate me
Why don't you need me, empty and lonely
My heart break, you make my heart break!
You make my heart break, you make my heart break
You make my heart break, you make my heart break!

[Verse 1: Grafh]
Tell me how you're doing, tell me what's wrong
Tell me why you're hurt, tell me why you're so [?]
Did your heart break, tell me did it ever
Somebody did you dirty, hope I [?] do it better!
We argue all the time like I wanna lose you
I don't show emotion you say that I confuse you
Say that when I'm mad that I'm verbally abuse you
But I just wanna make you feel beautiful!
Maybe I never show it, I never, ever say it
Feel hard love, so we ain't communicating
You say that when you're talking you feel that you're [?]
The way you talk [?] complaining

[Verse 2: Grafh]
Tell me that I'm inconsiderate
Tell me that I just don't give a shit
My attitude brought you down, damn it!
I guess I took you for granted a little bit
When I don't appreciate you, you think I'm crazy
You say I don't treat you like a lady
You that we argue, you say I never listen
Tell me how you feel but I don't pay attention!
You say you don't trust me, I say you don't have to
Every time you call me, you say I never answer
You say I ain't a gentlemen, I ain't no romancer
[?] ain't no chance!

Wanna know a secret, I love it when you talk that
I love it when you talk that, I love your little attitude
Never ever fall back

You're calling me and I miss it? I'm a call back!
