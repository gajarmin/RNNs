[Intro]
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
You pussy niggas finna make me kill one a y'all

[Hook: T.I.]
Ain't a damn thang change
I still keep that thang right up under my shirt
Betta tell 'em I ain't playin'
Because it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt
Ain't a damn thang change
I still keep that thang right up under my shirt
Run up on him where he hang and BANG!
Cause it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Alota pussy niggas talk like broads love runnin' they mouth
That is til I run in they house
Put the gun in they mouth, tell 'em "Nigga talk shit now"
You'd think they know the gun go BOW!
I ain't scared of the law
Naw I'm about to go to war what it is nigga win lose or draw
I'll never get caught murkin' y'all cuz it ain't what you do
The question is: Who saw?
Shawty I'm way too raw
Catch me any day you want you could think I'm a play if you want
But the fact still remain if I got a AK and you don't
Well then playa you gone
Don't get me wrong there's some niggas wanna kill me too (Well where they at?)
But this ain't bout shit cause it's well known where I'm at
They could catch me in the booth right now if you really like that
Naw nigga let they ho get him in the whole shit, the 44 spit they holla "Oh shit!"
Protectin' her and you both hit
You betta check ya girl cause you be so sick
If the choppa leave you with no dick
Or a plastic bag holdin' yo' shit
Leave 6 in you, a couple more in ya bitch
And I don't miss cause I'm focused nigga

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 2: Alfa Mega]
(I got you Tip)
(I'm finna ride homie)
Fuck niggas might talk loud, act real, but they don't really want this here
Pussy niggas betta act right, lay low, we know where ya family live
Trust me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duck tapin' ya kids
You can pray all you want but I don't forgive
Ya shoulda been doin' that before ya did whatcha did
I ain't gotta spell it out pimp you know what it is
I'll rest you case for ya real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons with me, dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got K's, half got Macs
Bring 'em out, bring em out, show me where he at
We can do him right here, we could catch him in trap
Run up on his 'lac put a hole in his hat
With his brain on the dash, and his thoughts in his lap
And dump 50 more on him and tell him to hold that
Lights out, no hasta mañana, hasta la vista, sayonara
Y tú no tomorrow, no remorse and no sorrow
And the next one a y'all niggas try me like that
I swear to God man I'm really gon' snap

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Right now I'mma give you somethin' that a make a nigga beg "Please"
When a bullet wiz by, he'll probably feel a little breeze
Drop to ya knees, see the big barrel of the chrome
Fifth triple grip handles in the squeeze
I keep a couple of those for the niggas who talk shit
When I go to Jacob and cop that ring
If you try to see me I'mma cock that thang
And I'mma pop that thang, and the shots gon' sting (really?)
The nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga stuck with me
And tell you somethin' if you really were smart and you knew
Better people probably tell ya don't fuck with me
Front if want motherfucka you can catch it
Smile on my face even though I got a ratchet
Pop off (police) pull me over believe I got a compartment if I gotta stash it
Must I just remind y'all niggas when I come through
Know that I'mma find y'all niggas, take two (break through)
Bust so many shots gun powder probably blind y'all niggas now (Okay, okay let's go)
See you don't know really wanna feel that Mossberg blow (naw)
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga
When I finish it'll turn into an absurd show (listen)
Then you better observe yo
Feel the sizzle from the bullet of the Glock burn slow (ssss)
Shit'll probably twist you up just a little and have your body leanin' lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down betta (lay down)
Checkin' for a nigga, come and put your body in the dirt
I don't play bitch, you really need to go the other way
If you ain't know I got it under my shirt

[Hook: T.I.][Rick Ross]
I'm focused on Fetti Candy convertible Chevy
Fuck it, call me petty and owe me, I'm coming to edit
I'm coming to set it, pussy nigga I said it
Believe that fake shit if you want, them niggas pathetic
I'm smoking Jimmy Gee, so you know the weed fire
I got a crib in the A that's big as Green Bry
Ain't no furniture in it, just tees and Levi's
Couple dollars and them clips for the gringas
I'm talking more blow and I'm feeling bigger now
I'm talking M's nigga, put them little figures down
One time for Alfamega, we are alpha beta's
And we're out for cheddar, until we're out forever

[Alfamega]
Uh-huh, yes sir, this the G-mix
Alfamega run these streets, what it be bitch
Cause you're faking with it, and I know it
But the time has come, you gon' have to show it
I fuck with real goons, and O.G.'s
You fuck with straight lames, and wannabes
I got the Chevy pushing, in the fast lane
Smoking Obama, laughing at John McCain
Thinking like Malcolm while I exit ML King
I gotta get mines, and that's by any means
I know the haters thinking, how can this be
Alfamega, Rick Ross, Bun-B, and T.I.P

[Hook]
Ain't got another putting on like me
I can buy the bar 7 days out the week
We getting money uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yes sir

[Bun-B]
It's the underground, king and I
Be coming down, I'm singing my
New song, my crew long
Crack the window, this dro is too strong
You wrong, and I'm right
But you gon understand that with hindsight
Go get your mind right, and level off
I'm sub-woofer hard boy, you're treble soft
Go get your boss, go get your chief
Get get your O.G. and tell him bring his piece
I got the grill, I got the gas
He not the trill, I will dump his ass

[Hook]

[T.I.P.]
Stay on automatic, I ain't talking bout the gas shit
Well known, shorty flashing, fantastic, I'm spazzing
California mansion, poolside lamping
But still run zone 1, shorty what's happening
Rappers way average, shorty stay swagging
Death before dishonor, hate haters with a passion
Record drop straight to the top, no zig-zagging
Talking about I'm falling off, I'm laughing, imagine
I'm still getting money to the point it ain't funny
Shut broke niggas up, when I holla about a hundred
Quarter mill on me homie, want it, let's run it
Don't need the the dough trust me, hustling's just a rush for me
No dispute, who you fooling, the best to ever do it
And slice it how you like it, still I'm in the top two and
I'm on the top of that list, ask anybody that shit
The coldest on the mic, flowing with a southern accent
Nigga![Hook: Alfamega x2]
So we ain't gotta flex nigga we got big dough
Big trucks big wheels blowing big drugs
And for the realer niggas we got big 44's
And one clip make a nigga stop drop and roll

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I got big dough nigga got big rides
Got chauffeurs nigga, I don't drive
18 mind frame grown and steady
Why a sucka nigga hating plotting up on livin' lavish
Sucka free best believe that's some shit to claim
BK on my hat on my shirt and my chain
Step grown get dough on some real talk
My niggas post upon the slab on some real talk
I let a pussy nigga slide cuz I'm bout some paper
Whip a nigga in the A yeah I fucks without my maker
From the sip to the ham to the block
With the book work in and I cock that drop
It's not hard young nigga cuz this ain't rocket science
Hot shit on the shelves motherfuckers got's to buy it
So keep it cool young nigga because my clique some riders
Make niggas stop drop and roll cuz we by

[Hook: Alfamega x2]

[Verse 2: Alfamega]
Listen I ain't got nothin' to prove to you dudes
I ain't goin' out my way to floss for you fools
Before the rap game I was [?] big twos
Slick Ricky wasn't the only nigga rockin' big jewels
While y'all was getting dressed, tryna rush to school
I was teachin' young Dre to [?] one into two
I'm the realest I know in and out the booth
Cuz I been done the shit that y'all tryna do, Yeah
The shit you doin' now, I did that times two
The bitch you with now I bust her in 92
So I guess you could say that's throwback pussy
I'm a vet in these streets nigga I ain't no rookie
I'm a money go getter, a known head spinner
A fuck yo dude and you too nigga
I'm takin' the gloves off and I ain't playin' no more
I dare a nigga act like he don't know, c'mon

[Hook: Alfamega x2][Intro]
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
