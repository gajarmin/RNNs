Caught in the cycle, black American psychopathic
And I can't do right, nigga, doing wrong is my rite of passage
Straight in the street life, I'm trying to interact with the 'matics
One hundred baggies all wrapped in plastic, I'm living savage
It's hot in these damn streets, shot this nigga last week
Police on my last nerve, I'mma gon' make this last serve
And hit 65 South and get low than a bitch
You see me back in the g, then that means I'm back on my dick
Back on that bullshit, full clip, don't play with a full deck
Hope my pack ain't caught up, it ain't made it to my hood yet
Did some niggas dirty, and I can't wait for the day they burn me
Cause I showed them hoes no mercy, Lord forgive me, I was thirsty

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Scrilla]

Snatch a nigga out the car and take a nigga pride
And if we beefing in these streets, ain't nowhere you can hide
We kill a nigga, dump his body on 285

Whip a college tuition with my right hand
Can you drop it old school, you got the right man
Get them 20’s off the floor, I'm getting fly today
And you ain't gotta even sell them they just fly away
Cut that motherfucker off, no ceiling fan
When you catch me in the coupe, no ceiling man

You know my partner got the lean, drink seller

Niggas fronting affect me because they really sour
We in camosas spent that hay stack
A cool hundred thousand long that’s a hay stack
And my block look like a race track
I’m jimmy Johnson lapping niggas gunning on the gas
On the floor with miss ass counting up them bands
I can catch the bag blind folded I got great hands
Clear the set,  count it up onto the next shift
Come get this shit too many trash bags off in this bitch

[Hook: Jeezy][Intro]
I know all about broke and stugglin
I'm still in that boat
Scrilla, what up?
On them days when them nuisances
Made me look for a rope

[Verse 1]
To whom it may a offend, this here's the realest shit I wrote
I'm tired of other people's problems
I would much rather be alone
I'm tired of niggas shook and jivin'
I'm tired of hoes on my bone, with nothing intriguing to say
I'm tired of being at home
I'm tired of wakin' up, blazin' up, layin' up, savin' up
I don't make enough and I'm tired of places tellin' me no
I'm tired of livin this way, I'm tryna be out on that road
No disrespect to my queen, but I'm always after my dough
She know I'm always on the go, she may not see me no mo'
If I decide to go home, can't get me out of my zone
It's like them days get long and nigga them nights get cold
And if we longer enough in this world, we might can grow old
I still know all about broke and struggle
I been there before
It'll keep you down and keep you dying
Like there's a whale in that boat
But even if it ain't sunny I glow
Said even when it ain't sunny I glow
And if it ain't about money then I don't go no where
I'm nailed to the flo'

[Hook: 2x]
I know all about broke and stugglin
I'm still in that boat
On them days when them nuisances
Made me look for a rope
But even if it ain't sunny I glow
Said even when it ain't sunny I glow
And if it ain't about money then I don't go no where
I'm nailed to the flo' (to the flo!)

[Verse 2]
I'm always stressin' out for that cash flow
That cheddar, that dough
Shit keep me down, it keep me down, it's a whale in my boat
I know all about struggle, right now I'm tryna stay a float
But it seem like money all on my want
That bitch the sail to my boat
And it got me doing thangs that my parents seen and they gone tell me no
Gotta keep some sails in my coat
Even thought about sellin my soul
There ain't no heaven for hustlas, I guess to hell I'm gone go
In a pair of these gasoline draw
Bustin these raps that I flow
Oh and I be trappin for sho' cause I ain't goin back to broke
I get better with time, yall get wack as yall go
So whether it's trafficking coke
I'mma do whatever I gotta to stack a wot of them dollas
Forever I'm after my dough
What you harassing me fo? What you keep askin' me fo?
If it ain't about money, I'm def
Other wise just pass me some dro
8 Ball, MJG, UGK, Tre and Z-Ro my heroes
Let go my nuts, get off my tip, let me release my ego

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 3]
I'm only focused on cheese, but I got every right to
May Buddha bless them niggas that scheming on me, no need to be spiteful
But not dumb but I'm go dump
I know how to shoot a rifle
The bigger is the harder he fall make it tower like to Eiffel
I told you 8 Ball, MJG, Jay-Z, A.B. in my idols
I wanted to be just like you, trappin the surface my rivals
They still underground status, my rhyme book look like a bible
Truly a savior, they treat my shit like rules from the bible

Cause in the streets I claim, you gotta let ya nuts hang

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Caught in the cycle, black American psychopathic
And I can't do right, nigga, doing wrong is my rite of passage
Straight in the street life, I'm trying to interact with the 'matics
One hundred baggies all wrapped in plastic, I'm living savage
It's hot in these damn streets, shot this nigga last week
Police on my last nerve, I'mma gon' make this last serve
And hit 65 South and get low than a bitch
You see me back in the g, then that means I'm back on my dick
Back on that bullshit, full clip, don't play with a full deck
Hope my pack ain't caught up, it ain't made it to my hood yet
Did some niggas dirty, and I can't wait for the day they burn me
Cause I showed them hoes no mercy, Lord forgive me, I was thirsty

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Scrilla]
You don't wanna see me with that sack low
My name ain't Jody, but I'm coming through your back door
In all black, no mask, with a .45
And if this pussy buck a lick, then it's homicide
I'm from Zone 4 Atlanta, where these killers ride
Snatch a nigga out the car and take a nigga pride
And if we beefing in these streets, ain't nowhere you can hide
We kill a nigga, dump his body on 285
I'm getting tired of all these fuck niggas running around
Talking all that tough shit
Like you've been there and you've sold that
But in real life you don't run shit
My homie called me with a big lick
10,000 pills, about 10 bricks
I'm walking in with that big stick
Gonna lay it down with that dope dick

Let's talk bout dope in these hoes, I put that dough over bitches
Haters lips on that whip, look like that bitch blow me kisses

Got my crook in my city, push whips talking midgets
Popcorn got it popping, not that Orville Redenbacher
I'm talking bails of that yay, I'm talking scales of that chyea
Look how that water just shocked it, look how that soda just locked it
All my bitches love me, all my niggers they silent
Couple niggers that hustle, couple niggers that's robbing
Put them hoes on the vodka, peep them hoes in the lobby
Started off in the bed, fuck them hoes on the carpet

Yeah, nigga gangsta shit
See what a nigga gotta realize is
That a nigga, really don't like doing what he do
But fast cash, is more addictive than crack itself, you feel me

[Hook]
If I could then I would, stop slanging caine
Cause I know, that I should
But everytime I try, it's like I'm back in the hood
And everytime I sleep, I dream my Lac's fill with wood
I can't help it, nigga I'm a gangsta

[Lil' O]
All I do is gangsta shit
Go to work grab the four, spank the brick
All I do is hit stangs and licks, push cocaine and whip
I'm off the chain, like a dangerous pit
So you know the Fat Rat, gon stuff his face
Bleed the block nonstop, till I bust my safe
All these rappers telling lies mayn, fuck these fakes
You can tell by my style, I done touched some weight
Ask these boys from the Brae', I made my bread from butter
And I'm married to the streets, like I wed the gutter
Hit I-10, with a hem and a muffler
Make a nigga drop dead, if he ever say that I ain't no hustler
Dear Lord, have mercy
I'm a greedy motherfucker, and I'm thirsty
I got the devil on my back, and he done cursed me
I'm addicted to this cash and it hurts me, somebody help me

Even can't slipping on my hoochie, sleeping at fo' in the morn'
Cause my dog, need four of them zones
Hit the stash, lock the door and I'm gone
Make way, cause Mack Biggers bout to go in the zone
Knowing his own my competition, see they puzzled and lost
I paid the cost baby, now I just be juggling salt
Talk down you better muzzle your mouth, 'fore I run in your house
And fuck around, and put a gun in your mouth
What are stones about, ki's and waters who can run a quick route
And feed em the rock, and let em know what money's about
Cause all I know is getting cash, and then flash
Piss me off, I get a Mack and a mask
Knock a nigga do' down, and tell that nigga put his stacks in the bag
And don't flinch, my reactions are bad
I'm attracted to cash, but if I could then I would throw my crack in the bag
My Mack in the trash, but everytime I try it's like I couldn't have

[Scrilla]
It's the gangsta shooter out the gutter, way ahead of my time
With the heart of a hustler, and I predator mine
I spit that shit that leaves blood in my mouth, I'm the vill' of the South
Stepping on work, like a rug in your house
My fans scream as I dream, of having sold out shows
But I way cook paying bills, out my po' out bowl
Where I'm from the dust ain't dirty, determine niggas fluff they turkey's
And if you burn, nigga your trust ain't worthy
What you know bout getting your mail, with a digital scale
And dropping one and drowning one, or you shitting in jail
I'm just to satisfy mo' cabbage, puffing pounds of lettuce
Cause our life, is rough around the edges
That's why I peep game, through the frames on the bridge of my nose
I'm whipping up quick on my stove, in my slippers and robe
And my last zone's gone, before I slip on my clothes
If I could then I would stick my dick in a globe, fuck the world

(*talking*)
I can't help it, I'm a Brae' block motherfucking gangsta
I can't help it, I'm a Southwest motherfucking gangsta
I can't help it, I'm a H-Town motherfucking gangsta
We can't help it, we some bar none motherfucking gangstas[Intro]
I know all about broke and stugglin
I'm still in that boat
Scrilla, what up?
On them days when them nuisances
Made me look for a rope

[Verse 1]
To whom it may a offend, this here's the realest shit I wrote
I'm tired of other people's problems
I would much rather be alone
I'm tired of niggas shook and jivin'
I'm tired of hoes on my bone, with nothing intriguing to say
I'm tired of being at home
I'm tired of wakin' up, blazin' up, layin' up, savin' up
I don't make enough and I'm tired of places tellin' me no
I'm tired of livin this way, I'm tryna be out on that road
No disrespect to my queen, but I'm always after my dough
She know I'm always on the go, she may not see me no mo'
If I decide to go home, can't get me out of my zone
It's like them days get long and nigga them nights get cold
And if we longer enough in this world, we might can grow old
I still know all about broke and struggle
I been there before
It'll keep you down and keep you dying
Like there's a whale in that boat
But even if it ain't sunny I glow
Said even when it ain't sunny I glow
And if it ain't about money then I don't go no where
I'm nailed to the flo'

[Hook: 2x]
I know all about broke and stugglin
I'm still in that boat
On them days when them nuisances
Made me look for a rope
But even if it ain't sunny I glow
Said even when it ain't sunny I glow
And if it ain't about money then I don't go no where
I'm nailed to the flo' (to the flo!)

[Verse 2]
I'm always stressin' out for that cash flow
That cheddar, that dough
Shit keep me down, it keep me down, it's a whale in my boat
I know all about struggle, right now I'm tryna stay a float
But it seem like money all on my want
That bitch the sail to my boat
And it got me doing thangs that my parents seen and they gone tell me no
Gotta keep some sails in my coat
Even thought about sellin my soul
There ain't no heaven for hustlas, I guess to hell I'm gone go
In a pair of these gasoline draw
Bustin these raps that I flow
Oh and I be trappin for sho' cause I ain't goin back to broke
I get better with time, yall get wack as yall go
So whether it's trafficking coke
I'mma do whatever I gotta to stack a wot of them dollas
Forever I'm after my dough
What you harassing me fo? What you keep askin' me fo?
If it ain't about money, I'm def
Other wise just pass me some dro
8 Ball, MJG, UGK, Tre and Z-Ro my heroes
Let go my nuts, get off my tip, let me release my ego

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 3]
I'm only focused on cheese, but I got every right to
May Buddha bless them niggas that scheming on me, no need to be spiteful
But not dumb but I'm go dump
I know how to shoot a rifle
The bigger is the harder he fall make it tower like to Eiffel
I told you 8 Ball, MJG, Jay-Z, A.B. in my idols
I wanted to be just like you, trappin the surface my rivals
They still underground status, my rhyme book look like a bible
Truly a savior, they treat my shit like rules from the bible

[Hook: 2x]Pubs clubs parties and disco's co's co's
Drink weed dizzle and the hoe's hoe's hoe'sBitch I know I'm the shit, that's why I'm driving slow

When you see me I'm sittin low, on forgiato's ho, on forgiato's ho, on forgiato's ho
When you see me I'm getting dough, on forgiato's ho

Look at them chopping blades, you see them blades chopping
Keep killing them folk boy, and you gon need johnny cochran
Check out my new wrist watch, the one that got johnny watchin
Used to see when I wave, it look like johnny talking
I'm guilty as stuntin hard, think I need Oj lawyer that white broad goes awful hard, we call that there oj order
My whips clean as mama dishes and I had to order those
Pull up with so many bitches, you'll think that I order hoes
They know I'm never slipping, splittin' them splitarellos

My autos be sitting clean

Drop the top, ridin through the fo'... with the strap in my lap
If a nigga get wrong, he gon' get that
Like a mouse, make him feel it like a bitch slap
Lil niggas 'round here tote big straps
Hit the mall, buy it all, blow big stacks

Stop hatin' on me, that's what the watch fo'
Niggas plottin' on my life, I got the Glock fo'

Bullets hit him in his head from the peephole
He gon' take a free shot like a free throw

Money folder, highest over, grind on overload
And my ol' lady say, she can never tell what's on my mind all she know, I'm blowed
All she wanna know is how much yo I sold, but a nigga tricked off and blowed it doe
When I need a freak for the week, so I hit South Beach, laid up with some Florida hoes
Got a bitch suckin cock I'm on 'cotin, least a hundred fifty shots but I'm riding
Pull up in the Fountain Blue, see what her mouth can do but when I catch a nut then I'm slidin
Nigga got a stable full of bad muthafuckas, ice-cold cup of that Chad Butler what I say awake, I gotta make it shake and shine hard, grind hard 'til the last clucker
All my niggas done earned stripes, broads be on our balls cause we serve white
Dawg, I make a call to niggas behind the wall, hitt'em up give a fuck about a third strike, bitch
If you lookin' for that fire, fire shit, hit the back phone I got'em doe
Parking lot pimpin' and ridin' slow and I'm on forgiato's ho (yeaah)

Bitch I know I'm the shit, that's why I'm driving slow
I'm high as I'm a get, bitch I'm still blowing dro
Look at me what you see, you know I'm getting dough
