"Trapped in a deadly video game..." [GZA] 7x
"...with just one man" [GZA]

[Slug]
Put your quarter up
I got first (Sluggo)
And I'm the type of customer that orders the works
Not the same as any, I run the game of plenty
I buy my nickels from a dime who goes by the name of Penny
The Last Starfighter searching for the Starfucker
The drunk parallel parker, thank God for car bumpers
Another day, shot in the head and buried
While your wifey tries to convince me that she shouldn't have got married
From the Galaga bugs to the amateur thugs
To the punk rock chicks that can't handle my hugs
I'll be standin upon the web, born out of a thought
Where the spider makes her bed out of the carcasses she caught
Aiyyo she's got that good head, me I got dandruff
She wears a smile, and me I wear handcuffs
Yo wait a minute savior, how about a little truth
You couldn't save yourself if you had a cape and a phonebooth
The roof is on fire, the floor is underwater
The fish ignored the bait and ate the bobber
And as God hovers up above the highway and the chopper
I'm down here writing songs for her daughter (Is that your quarter?)

"Trapped in a deadly video game..." [3x]
"...with just one man"

[Aesop Rock]
Put your quarter up, brother
My underhanded summerjam escaped with a free game in my back pocket
The ego and the muddy gear lept clear off the concrete valley
To murder silhouettes with a budget that have me bummin cigarettes
My soul stuck in a mudpit absorbing anchors
With a y-shaped water stick and five great venoms
Caught it at the dog door by a sideways phantom
With a swift attitude problem
Knuckling up with a carbon-based common guarding goblin
I'm drowsy
Who drifted by the lousy Virgin Mary night light luminants
That blew a kiss to sin
Would've said "Count me in" but just couldn't afford the bounty
I'll do the deed myself before the second leaping sheep
Even got counted
Multiple tasking, drastic unsocialable captain gasping
Jay Gatsby the great bashing open the plastic backspins
Strapped with a plague and a cocktail napkin
Wrapped in oragami dragon fashion
Flashed in a effort to smash your pattern
Pen magnanimous
To say a little on this ancient foundation
They found na-tions running bases for nickeltips
Coordinate the zoning and the speeders trickle drips out
I'll skip town once these upright citizens sit down

"Trapped in a deadly video game"

[MF Doom]
Uh, yo I go next, put your quarter up
For bets, put your daughter up
MF is sorta corrupt
Not to be confused with the fake fly raw sound
Still the one who used to take your high score down
With more rhymes than germs a spitball carry
As it fly through the air like Pitfall Harry
Shit y'all fairies take a loss like Slobodan
This goes out to man, woman, and child from Robotron
Before the end, I save the world like Defender
There's no time for curling up to hurl from a bender
Like back when your last five never went to weed
More likely on like twenty rounds of Centipede
If it go fast or slow, no mattering
The flow down pat like the ole Acro pattern
Those need to learn the technique, take heed, note
And switch like Spy Hunter when he *psst* to the speedboat[Prime]
Yo, this is Prime
But to tell you cats who the hell I am
So listen up
I know you cats been asking, 'bout to answer that

[Verse 1]
Who's that kid that's rocking head phones on the back of the bus?
Reciting verses loud as fuck, while still tagging shit up
Who's laughing it up, sand paper scratching shit up
Whose making passengers blush when he babbles and busts
It's Prime
These cats that rhyme don't even know what it's like
They got me vexed wanting to test them when they holding the mic
That's why I'm yelling, talking shit and acting so impolite
Battling me you're either throwing the towel, or throwing the fight
I jump of the top of the rope, so stop your approach
Rappers keep trying to be different instead of trying to be dope
Harder then most, choking artists who croak, serving mimics
Setting fire to your notebook while you still writing your verses in it
My words indented, plus they're properly placed
All in your face, gems prices keeps them locked in a safe
Plotting to take the world over with rhyme, controlling your mind
So sit back and behold its P-Prime!

[Hook x 2]
I'm unbreakable, you can't make me or break me
And I don't give a fuck, none of you bitch niggas can take me
So when I hear you cats rap I have to resort
To telling kids how it is with a status report

[Verse 2]
Now a days commercial cats are all taking the game
All wearing similar outfits and all walking the same
You just acting for your boys you should all be ashamed
When on a low and all alone your looking awkward and plane
Ya'll 'ain't superstars fuck with me and you'll get bruised and scared
Even your beats don't match your just as whack as your producers are
Fronting' yourself like you got a gun on the shelf
Running with wealth, praying you wake up with somebody else
Little fish in a big pond I'm serving all of you toys
You couldn't get five mics on stage with four of your boys
Your whack is a rule, I rap and dismantle your crew
And leaving you guessing what's getting dropped first, your album or you
You've had it you're threw, get crushed by my weakest touch
I spit shit that speaks in volumes, my whispers will make the speakers bust
Trust that prime is chosen with the mic I'm holding
Here's a toast for you going platinum and silence is golden

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Now a days it's just as bad if you're an underground cat
The ??? are mad at this cause all that's coming outs whack
An analyst I have to diss cause half these kids just can't rap
They put on backpacks and label there whack shit as abstract
The other half they carry on about the revolution
I guess doing tours and being vegetarian is desolation
It's retribution when I get in the zone
Shit I spit gets in your dome like rays from cellular phones
Radiation I lay waiting to strike, so stay hating
As I leave these rappers shook like getting coughed up by an aids patient
I make statements that will fuck with your head
Till your flustered and shaking while your tucked in your bed
Pumping the lead, pencil is the way I diss MC's
Sticks and stones can't break my bones so your words don't mean shit to me
I'm vicious with the live flow, I spit wherever I go
So keep your eyes open from the nigga from Chicago

[Hook x2]

Ya, know what I'm saying
Memo on the beat
Molemen
Scam Artists
Keep an eye out
What!"I do some nasty shit" - Eddie Murphy
"Nasty"

[Intro] [Juice Talking]
Uh. Big Juice. 2 double zero uno. "Nasty". PNS. Molemen in the house
"Nasty". My nigga Memo in the house. Uh "Nasty"

[Verse One]
Ayo, this is how the shit run
The job I'ma get done
My sick tongue, spit one
Leave your whole shit numb
Bass go inside, coincidin' with the kick drum
Competition, just one
Victim, I lick one
Shot
The outcome, I murder for my income
Never to be outdone, the scale of one to ten son
Shit, I got good ones to great ones and then some
Cities, I ain't never been the type to represent one
I recite the poem cause I light your zone
And my home is where I roam on the microphone
Whenever the mic is on, I'm like Capone
I murder minus the syphilis
Rewind it when I kick this
Big Juice got flow as God is my witness
I scoop hot hoes and I'ma die with the slickness
When the spot blow, J slide with the sickness
Top flow
But I'm still down to ride with the quickness

[Scratch Hook]
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
Named Juice
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"

[Verse Two]
Molemen in the house
I'm well known for the free but my pen is just as deadly
I can come up off my dome if they behead me
Rappers need to slow down, I put the flow down
In your town I rule like I'm Judge Joe Brown
When it's all said and done, Big Juice will go down
As a vicious body puncher that ends it in fo' rounds
I'm one plane trip away from ruinin' your program
Compose for the hood like Rembrandt and Shopan
Men can't throw hands against me that's useless
I leave cats senseless, tryin' to call truces
But once they all defenseless, it ain't no excuses
I'm happy to commence if death is what he chooses
Anything J.U. touch, J.U. bruises
Winners don't pop the damn corks with the losers
I'm action
Either I can make 'em obey
Or like subtraction, the coroner can take 'em away

[Scratch Hook]
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
Named Juice
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"

[Verse Three]
I'm one step ahead of these niggas, I stay up
Most MC's hate every mic that J touch
To find me you gotta look way way up
Cause most nigga rap but they never say much
Like Nextel phones I can break y'all up
I roll with the heat that'll make y'all duck
I only squeeze once and I ate y'all up
My lyrics just fuckin' devastate, y'all suck
When my tec spray
Don't have your neck in my way
I'll have your broad readin' about your ass the very next day
Juice is bad to the bone like a fuckin' X-Ray
And I don't even spit unless I collect pay
I'm a flame in the game, can't wait to burn
But like gettin' a county check, I had to wait my turn
I must break you
So what's next for all y'all to follow?
These motherfuckers coughin' up blood like Apollo

[Buck 65]
I know I'm being followed by invisible men
Life is good, but why am I so miserable then
I'm second guessing my every decision
But my hand is guided with heavy precision
I can't even trust my own eyes
But actually everything I do is done with pin point accuracy
At least once a week I come this close to dying
But nothing ever happens
Am I supposed try and kill the heart of a man?
Or is every move I make just a part of the plan?
What should I expect the last mathematical invasion?
I refuse to believe my life is a mathematical equation
Can I do to pull the plug?
Or burn the bridges?
What if I start doing drugs or turn religious?
Every involuntary swallow brings a pattern and a chance to wear
A halo like the rings of Saturn
But do my family and friends know that I dome the back of my mind
To the back of my throat?
In front of my face and under my nose
No wonder why nobody notices any of this
I am expert, indivisible, miserable, individual over my head still
Burning the tread mill
One step faster than the man with the master plan, baby

Is this a game or it is real? (5x)

[Sixtoo]
Each move is like a simile
Compare to what I see to what I remember
Which pretender are you?
By standing on that same corner I've seen passing me in the present. The dream
Bend these words to mean what they mean now
Somehow lost in five double-U's
I misuse the game and then I forfeit the check mate
Rotates bishop, wait
I remember the next move
It goes something like:
My paper meshes weighs falling and I take flight
I fly into lay ups at night, see my piece is already there
See all the workers disappear into clarity
Never compare me to myself, I know us well
Living in between imagination and the parallel
One thing leading to nothing at all
Another thing leading to itself

Is this a game or is it a real? (5X)[Vakill]
We gun hold and not one cold and safe under the sun solar
So when I squeeze off 8, I'm guaranteed to make 7-Up yours like the uncola
Or retorically nice almost effortlessly
Born with a silver spoon in my mouth like infants with epilepsy
Shit, years after my prime leaves
I might have to resort to lettin' the nine squeeze to convince dick riders
To kindly let go of mine please
You a third nut separated at birth one conjoined testicle to tongue siamese
Last summer we jumped Out The Speakers and fucked shit up with the Vianese
Now watch me take a cold and this piss with a full bladder make time freeze
Golden shower the globe 'till every snowman across the fuckin' planet turns Chinese
My mentality is necrose red dot shit
To the face of the planet catchin' back here's ya' freckles
Me and J-U overshadowed the league, so you blaze battlin' with two dicks in
Yo' mouth till 'yo jaws give it out from battle fatigue

[Juice]
The professional's red dot'll turn these niggas into vegetables
So vivid I could kick it at the Cannes Film Festival
Decaffienated coffee shop niggas get assassinated
I was vaccinated with a syrum that was rap related
I spit a theorem full strength I don't approximate
Intoxicate ya' ho and show you footage o' da cock she ate
Whether Glock 3-8 grenades and street sweepers
Address me on yo' knees like students should greet teachers
My intellect special, I hold my tech special
Jet Li or Bruce, pick one I'm next level
The rest see me new some smoke six blunts inhale em'
And hang em' out to dry like Witch Hunts in Salem
Shit my status dope enough to catapult me to the top
We blew the spot like it was just another buddah drop
You couldn't dream of winning if you used your imagination
Triangle Offense and Molemen collaboration

[Hook]
[Vakill] Am I the sickest nigga shittin' on em'?
[Juice] No doubt
[Vakill] Y'all niggas want the heat?
[Juice] Than get ya' dough out
[Vakill] Kill with niggas before they even spit they flow out, we brought it
When y'all took the whole route
[Both] Fuck around and get yo' ass tore out

[Juice] Am I the nicest nigga spittin' it?
[Vakill] No doubt
[Juice] You niggas want the heat?
[Vakill] Get ya dough out
[Juice] Big Juice rip niggas before they even spit they flow out, we brought
It while y'all niggas took the whole route
[Both] Fuck around and get your ass tore out

[Juice]
And like I said we spit the vividest rhymes because we livin' it
You'll need eight more rappers just to make this shit equivalent
Juice crush this, any mic that Juice touches
We be all in your girlfriend's mouth like toothbrushes
Nasty off the head and when I'm in the booth fuck it
Like the skin on Edward James Olmos I'm too rugged
I could either thug it, lug it round or unplug it
Represent illmatic half time on one love it
It's murder to cassette and I beg you to come dub it
We could either use our hands but Tom just stun gun it
And I ain't ever been known to have the cleanest and demeanor
But I get the whole U.S. Open like Venus and Serena
Period, this is How We Chill, Freestyle or Written
When we came Out The Speakers last year they didn't listen
So next time I crack they bones follow me
I'm so much doper than mc's, I owe these niggas an apology

[Vakill]
Fuck sweating bullets niggas perspiring
Sixteen shot clips when I put they heat on slow roast
I don't just outshine you, I show my ass and make yo' face the co-host
While me and J-U run a triangle on yo' bitch
Feeding these balls in a low post
I'm a cross breed between
Letter T crosses in the letter I infrared sick dot us
Poison fingers until my wig smarter, from a hennison vine a stigmata with
Lacerations half Christ and Big Poppa
I'll push the envelope far beyond the term ill limits
That's why some of the nicest is still timid
If I said it than Kill meant it
Playa, only way yo' jersey hanging from the rafters
Is if yo' bitch ass still in it
One penis lacin' double penetration my pen is wastin' a semen tastin'
Substance on a fragment of yo' imagination
Fuck for the laugh of the exit wounds
I'll plug brains with .50 caliber slugs and plant seeds in exit wounds
I wipe my shit cat or corn it's just to whip motherfuckers
And zig-zag and watch his wig drag
In 2000 Triangle Offense gettin' dough and big bags
While you buy season tickets to ride dicks fag like six flags

Take a bite outta me
You wanna battle me, badly?
Son, you're sadly mistaken I'm taking your heart for charity
Make you a memory, forever remember the melody (uh-ha)
Mystically, magically, cast you a spell, put you in agony
Half of me's energy, half of me's chemically imbalance-y
Challenge the majority (what), mudthafuck autourity
Spit like there was four of me
Metaphorical imagery wintery wonderland, ???, visually, vividly
Son, I'm living the life, stripping the light out of the galaxy
Brooklyn academy
Climbing around the walls of insanity

Yo, I stomp beat like the feet of extinct reptiles

Set style into motion, like the mic mechanism
Mic check the rhythm
Furious five, live
??Got?? re-incarnated on a different timeline
S, T, R the O, you know the rest (???)
??We're?? the best happy seeing cops with exploded vests (Blaow)
I'm so depressed, I write rhymes to go to rest
Sold the best shit, this side of a death kiss
Restless, spit aggressive like "Fuck y'all" (y'all)
Expose y'all for bitches, now the bitches will fuck y'all (y'all)
Wassup y'all, I spit, now you're giving shit up?
All the talking
Now you're like, walking on lava
There's the mic but don't bother, I'm alike to your father
I write, tip the barber blade, snip a clip
Transform the metal ??plic??, start super-baffalling hippocrites
Six shots short of a single clip
Bust off your wing with this
Your DJ swing on my single dick
Rock it like you fucking back me up on the road
But let static reload, ??and he too, tragically goes??
And your label won't help you neither
I'm a believer in internet fever
That got 'em falling to the Queen of Shiva
This shit is wet
And you ain't no water breather
You better leave this shit to Breezer
Take a breather

C-Rayz

I'm one of tha illest things you can think of
Like Sisqo slapping Mike Tyson with a pink glove
I know you fucked up, ya'll should've dropped acapella's
Cause you smoke crack, that dont make you down with roc-a-fella
You're a bastard, aborted from the mothership
Like a greedy fly, you always on some other shit
These ain't battles (wha), these are lyrical punishments
I'm their pop's man, look at what I done to the kids
I feel bad, its because I immediately spit
Your moms went out to buy tissue, never came back
I knew she was full of shit
You wack, and the fact, you and I know both, that the best rhymes of your life, will be your suicide note
Thats a joke
I did an instore
Took your girl to my house and did an inwhore, told her I was an ewok
From the planet endor
You laugh
FUCK rap
Play an accordian y'all
You couldn't rock the crowd if you threw stones at the audience ??before??
With one score, y'all found out we too raw
I've seen so much bitch in you, I though you were ???shoe stores???
I smack crews, for sounding wacker that Shaq Fu
Until Redman comes through, and screams "that's you!"
No, you'd better say is "i'll be wack"
I'll react like hammers jus tapped ma kneecaps
Blaow[Verse: Mike Moses]
This means war for all you stupid little bastards. Playing with your life and all of mother Earth’s chapters
Popping pills instead of popping bubbles, speaking backwards. Stop and feel the tits on girly girl that’s speaking passwords
Farmers at the market and consumers in the garden. Streets are filled with peace and all the thugs will beg your pardon
Offs are often rip when prices really are a bargain. Sales are often sold when prices go right over margin

Kids are killing cops and all the models with the pigs. Biggest Loser pigs replaced with magazine twigs
Magazine clips are filled with middle finger index. Limousines shorter than the life span of the princess
Nine will go to eight and then the eighth will go to seventh. Life is going faster, was the twentieth now eleventh
Celebrities are poor, surround civilians with cameras. Nerdiest of nerds spitting dopest flow stanzas

Ask the honest folks if they all living with their lies
[Silence]
Tunnel vision when my mind is kush smoking provoking innocence. Gavel hit the brick with joking vividness
Rich can’t pay the bills and now the poor can watch cable. Hypnotize their minds perspective incidents unstable
The fable of the past is but a victimless archangel. The staple on the paper is reversible, how gratefulMr. Metaphor

The girl of my dreams, ain't from round here
She don't care about the bullshit down here
I wish you'd come back and save me lady
Cause these earth women wanna make me crazy
I try everyday to escape the world
Fantasizing about my alien girl
Look into the sky to find my love
Because these earth women are too fucked up

[Verse One: Slug]
She was naked
Standing over my bed
It must be a dream
Try to shake it from your head
Six packs deep
Not exact, but roughly
Half asleep until she reached out and touched me
She was ugly, but glorious divine
No words needed, she spoke into my mind
Didn't make a sound
No need to
She could read through
Every thought (I was see through)
Grabbed my hand
Led me to truth
Traveled from far to the top of my roof
She said she was one of two
She came to Minneapolis
Her twin sister went to Los Angeles
The plan was just to come find the Felts
And they was thinkin' maybe MURS and myself could help
She showed me how she came from a planet
Where everybody took all of their passion for granted
I tried to understand it
But I'm a one track
Starin' at her space tits, tryin' to hold me tongue back
Didn't matter she could read my mind
And you'd have to be blind not to see my crimes
She caught on
Well she's a quick learner
Climbed aboard her mothership as more than an observer
She said, "No" to the anal probe ("Drop it!")
But she swallowed the specimen to digest and take home

[Hook]

[Verse Two: MURS]
She wore a lavender Velour space suit with gray boots
Titanium O'Ryan diamond studded waist too
Anti gravity bra
Hug the breasts like it's supposed to
A future 50,000 volt laser in the holster
I approached her (shiiit)
I mean I had to
There's only two other guns in existance like that
And I couldn't fight that
Plus she was bad too
But somehow you, she just looked the other way
I held out my piece if she had a lot to say
"Where'd you get it, how'd you get it, who'd you kill in what system?"
I lit up a square, help my hand up, dismissed her
Went to kiss her but she flipped it
Grabbed my waist to try to get it
I snatched her wrist, twisted, leaned to her ear and whispered
"My boy Ant he theft it
The safety genetic
Anybody but me touch it and their hand will get shredded
Make a move like that you won't live to regret it"
She flipped me from my shoulders had the conversation deaded
I said "BITCH
What are you smokin'?"
A big fat dick comin' from the Pleiades
Don't make me fill your ass up with 50,000 z's of electricity
Bitch, I found my enemies
You need to recognize a G
She started chastising me
Dissed my whole galaxy
And the dudes that I roll with
Playin' the polar caps, she was one cold bitch
The whole bar was watchin' couldn't go for that shit
She paid for her drink then she headed for the door
Left me no choice I had to fire from the floor
En fuego
I mean the bitch went day glow
And vaporized into a pile of ash in a flash
About the size of an egg roll
And ayo
I know we just met and it could have been love
But the bottom line is
Never let a bitch disrespect you in the club

"Drop it" - Public Enemy

Peace"Trapped in a deadly video game..." [GZA] 7x
"...with just one man" [GZA]

[Slug]
Put your quarter up
I got first (Sluggo)
And I'm the type of customer that orders the works
Not the same as any, I run the game of plenty
I buy my nickels from a dime who goes by the name of Penny
The Last Starfighter searching for the Starfucker
The drunk parallel parker, thank God for car bumpers
Another day, shot in the head and buried
While your wifey tries to convince me that she shouldn't have got married
From the Galaga bugs to the amateur thugs
To the punk rock chicks that can't handle my hugs
I'll be standin upon the web, born out of a thought
Where the spider makes her bed out of the carcasses she caught
Aiyyo she's got that good head, me I got dandruff
She wears a smile, and me I wear handcuffs
Yo wait a minute savior, how about a little truth
You couldn't save yourself if you had a cape and a phonebooth
The roof is on fire, the floor is underwater
The fish ignored the bait and ate the bobber
And as God hovers up above the highway and the chopper
I'm down here writing songs for her daughter (Is that your quarter?)

"Trapped in a deadly video game..." [3x]
"...with just one man"

[Aesop Rock]
Put your quarter up, brother
My underhanded summerjam escaped with a free game in my back pocket
The ego and the muddy gear lept clear off the concrete valley
To murder silhouettes with a budget that have me bummin cigarettes
My soul stuck in a mudpit absorbing anchors
With a y-shaped water stick and five great venoms
Caught it at the dog door by a sideways phantom
With a swift attitude problem
Knuckling up with a carbon-based common guarding goblin
I'm drowsy
Who drifted by the lousy Virgin Mary night light luminants
That blew a kiss to sin
Would've said "Count me in" but just couldn't afford the bounty
I'll do the deed myself before the second leaping sheep
Even got counted
Multiple tasking, drastic unsocialable captain gasping
Jay Gatsby the great bashing open the plastic backspins
Strapped with a plague and a cocktail napkin
Wrapped in oragami dragon fashion
Flashed in a effort to smash your pattern
Pen magnanimous
To say a little on this ancient foundation
They found na-tions running bases for nickeltips
Coordinate the zoning and the speeders trickle drips out
I'll skip town once these upright citizens sit down

"Trapped in a deadly video game"

[MF Doom]
Uh, yo I go next, put your quarter up
For bets, put your daughter up
MF is sorta corrupt
Not to be confused with the fake fly raw sound
Still the one who used to take your high score down
With more rhymes than germs a spitball carry
As it fly through the air like Pitfall Harry
Shit y'all fairies take a loss like Slobodan
This goes out to man, woman, and child from Robotron
Before the end, I save the world like Defender
There's no time for curling up to hurl from a bender
Like back when your last five never went to weed
More likely on like twenty rounds of Centipede
If it go fast or slow, no mattering
The flow down pat like the ole Acro pattern
Those need to learn the technique, take heed, note
And switch like Spy Hunter when he *psst* to the speedboat[Prime]
Yo, this is Prime
But to tell you cats who the hell I am
So listen up
I know you cats been asking, 'bout to answer that

[Verse 1]
Who's that kid that's rocking head phones on the back of the bus?
Reciting verses loud as fuck, while still tagging shit up
Who's laughing it up, sand paper scratching shit up
Whose making passengers blush when he babbles and busts
It's Prime
These cats that rhyme don't even know what it's like
They got me vexed wanting to test them when they holding the mic
That's why I'm yelling, talking shit and acting so impolite
Battling me you're either throwing the towel, or throwing the fight
I jump of the top of the rope, so stop your approach
Rappers keep trying to be different instead of trying to be dope
Harder then most, choking artists who croak, serving mimics
Setting fire to your notebook while you still writing your verses in it
My words indented, plus they're properly placed
All in your face, gems prices keeps them locked in a safe
Plotting to take the world over with rhyme, controlling your mind
So sit back and behold its P-Prime!

[Hook x 2]
I'm unbreakable, you can't make me or break me
And I don't give a fuck, none of you bitch niggas can take me
So when I hear you cats rap I have to resort
To telling kids how it is with a status report

[Verse 2]
Now a days commercial cats are all taking the game
All wearing similar outfits and all walking the same
You just acting for your boys you should all be ashamed
When on a low and all alone your looking awkward and plane
Ya'll 'ain't superstars fuck with me and you'll get bruised and scared
Even your beats don't match your just as whack as your producers are
Fronting' yourself like you got a gun on the shelf
Running with wealth, praying you wake up with somebody else
Little fish in a big pond I'm serving all of you toys
You couldn't get five mics on stage with four of your boys
Your whack is a rule, I rap and dismantle your crew
And leaving you guessing what's getting dropped first, your album or you
You've had it you're threw, get crushed by my weakest touch
I spit shit that speaks in volumes, my whispers will make the speakers bust
Trust that prime is chosen with the mic I'm holding
Here's a toast for you going platinum and silence is golden

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Now a days it's just as bad if you're an underground cat
The ??? are mad at this cause all that's coming outs whack
An analyst I have to diss cause half these kids just can't rap
They put on backpacks and label there whack shit as abstract
The other half they carry on about the revolution
I guess doing tours and being vegetarian is desolation
It's retribution when I get in the zone
Shit I spit gets in your dome like rays from cellular phones
Radiation I lay waiting to strike, so stay hating
As I leave these rappers shook like getting coughed up by an aids patient
I make statements that will fuck with your head
Till your flustered and shaking while your tucked in your bed
Pumping the lead, pencil is the way I diss MC's
Sticks and stones can't break my bones so your words don't mean shit to me
I'm vicious with the live flow, I spit wherever I go
So keep your eyes open from the nigga from Chicago

[Hook x2]

Ya, know what I'm saying
Memo on the beat
Molemen
Scam Artists
Keep an eye out
What![Vakill]
We gun hold and not one cold and safe under the sun solar
So when I squeeze off 8, I'm guaranteed to make 7-Up yours like the uncola
Or retorically nice almost effortlessly
Born with a silver spoon in my mouth like infants with epilepsy
Shit, years after my prime leaves
I might have to resort to lettin' the nine squeeze to convince dick riders
To kindly let go of mine please
You a third nut separated at birth one conjoined testicle to tongue siamese
Last summer we jumped Out The Speakers and fucked shit up with the Vianese
Now watch me take a cold and this piss with a full bladder make time freeze
Golden shower the globe 'till every snowman across the fuckin' planet turns Chinese
My mentality is necrose red dot shit
To the face of the planet catchin' back here's ya' freckles
Me and J-U overshadowed the league, so you blaze battlin' with two dicks in
Yo' mouth till 'yo jaws give it out from battle fatigue

[Juice]
The professional's red dot'll turn these niggas into vegetables
So vivid I could kick it at the Cannes Film Festival
Decaffienated coffee shop niggas get assassinated
I was vaccinated with a syrum that was rap related
I spit a theorem full strength I don't approximate
Intoxicate ya' ho and show you footage o' da cock she ate
Whether Glock 3-8 grenades and street sweepers
Address me on yo' knees like students should greet teachers
My intellect special, I hold my tech special
Jet Li or Bruce, pick one I'm next level
The rest see me new some smoke six blunts inhale em'
And hang em' out to dry like Witch Hunts in Salem
Shit my status dope enough to catapult me to the top
We blew the spot like it was just another buddah drop
You couldn't dream of winning if you used your imagination
Triangle Offense and Molemen collaboration

[Hook]
[Vakill] Am I the sickest nigga shittin' on em'?
[Juice] No doubt
[Vakill] Y'all niggas want the heat?
[Juice] Than get ya' dough out
[Vakill] Kill with niggas before they even spit they flow out, we brought it
When y'all took the whole route
[Both] Fuck around and get yo' ass tore out

[Juice] Am I the nicest nigga spittin' it?
[Vakill] No doubt
[Juice] You niggas want the heat?
[Vakill] Get ya dough out
[Juice] Big Juice rip niggas before they even spit they flow out, we brought
It while y'all niggas took the whole route
[Both] Fuck around and get your ass tore out

[Juice]
And like I said we spit the vividest rhymes because we livin' it
You'll need eight more rappers just to make this shit equivalent
Juice crush this, any mic that Juice touches
We be all in your girlfriend's mouth like toothbrushes
Nasty off the head and when I'm in the booth fuck it
Like the skin on Edward James Olmos I'm too rugged
I could either thug it, lug it round or unplug it
Represent illmatic half time on one love it
It's murder to cassette and I beg you to come dub it
We could either use our hands but Tom just stun gun it
And I ain't ever been known to have the cleanest and demeanor
But I get the whole U.S. Open like Venus and Serena
Period, this is How We Chill, Freestyle or Written
When we came Out The Speakers last year they didn't listen
So next time I crack they bones follow me
I'm so much doper than mc's, I owe these niggas an apology

[Vakill]
Fuck sweating bullets niggas perspiring
Sixteen shot clips when I put they heat on slow roast
I don't just outshine you, I show my ass and make yo' face the co-host
While me and J-U run a triangle on yo' bitch
Feeding these balls in a low post
I'm a cross breed between
Letter T crosses in the letter I infrared sick dot us
Poison fingers until my wig smarter, from a hennison vine a stigmata with
Lacerations half Christ and Big Poppa
I'll push the envelope far beyond the term ill limits
That's why some of the nicest is still timid
If I said it than Kill meant it
Playa, only way yo' jersey hanging from the rafters
Is if yo' bitch ass still in it
One penis lacin' double penetration my pen is wastin' a semen tastin'
Substance on a fragment of yo' imagination
Fuck for the laugh of the exit wounds
I'll plug brains with .50 caliber slugs and plant seeds in exit wounds
I wipe my shit cat or corn it's just to whip motherfuckers
And zig-zag and watch his wig drag
In 2000 Triangle Offense gettin' dough and big bags
While you buy season tickets to ride dicks fag like six flags

[Hook]
[Juice] Am I the nicest nigga spittin' it?
[Vakill] No doubt
[Juice] Y'all niggas want the heat?
[Vakill] Get ya dough out
[Juice] Big Juice rip niggas before they even get they flow out, we brought
It while y'all niggas took the whole route
[Both] Fuck around and get your ass tore out

[Vakill] Am I the sickest nigga shittin' on em'?
[Juice] No doubt
[Vakill] Y'all niggas want the heat?
[Juice] Than get ya' dough out
[Vakill] Kill with niggas before they even spit they flow out, we brought it
When y'all took the whole route
[Both] Fuck around and get yo' ass tore out[Verse: Mike Moses]
This means war for all you stupid little bastards. Playing with your life and all of mother Earth’s chapters
Popping pills instead of popping bubbles, speaking backwards. Stop and feel the tits on girly girl that’s speaking passwords
Farmers at the market and consumers in the garden. Streets are filled with peace and all the thugs will beg your pardon
Offs are often rip when prices really are a bargain. Sales are often sold when prices go right over margin

Kids are killing cops and all the models with the pigs. Biggest Loser pigs replaced with magazine twigs
Magazine clips are filled with middle finger index. Limousines shorter than the life span of the princess
Nine will go to eight and then the eighth will go to seventh. Life is going faster, was the twentieth now eleventh
Celebrities are poor, surround civilians with cameras. Nerdiest of nerds spitting dopest flow stanzas

Ask the honest folks if they all living with their lies
[Silence]
Tunnel vision when my mind is kush smoking provoking innocence. Gavel hit the brick with joking vividness
Rich can’t pay the bills and now the poor can watch cable. Hypnotize their minds perspective incidents unstable
The fable of the past is but a victimless archangel. The staple on the paper is reversible, how grateful[Verse One]
What's the deal tho'/dildo like sex toys
You wanna loose respect boy?
Cause I can break backs and use you as a place mat
I smack you with an Almanac
So you can fuckin' face facts
Nacrobats is fresh and your crew is ridin' straight wack
If you thinkin' you're hotter hold your flames for ransom black
I'm a handsome black while you sound a bit Hanson black
I stay wreckin' it with nice battle etiquette
Ask you how you wanna get ripped
Punchlines or some street shit?
I say names for bitches
Fuck the street shit
You're just an MC on weekends always surrounded by weaklings
I'm rhymin' for the week's end
Seven days a week man
Got word play and a game of it with her last weekend
Your freestyle is shallow while mine is off the fuckin' deep end
With no life guards, you need recitative breathin'
Inhale
Now I'm smokin' heathens
I guess you believin' in a legend and be leavin'

[Hook] [x4]
Sterling Price not being nice is like no dots on dice
You wanna gamble your life
Bring your ass to the mic

Every time I open my mouth I bring my bank card

[Verse Two]
When I ball you might lose an eyeball cause I'm one of the tightest
With big balls like elephantiasis
Mic devices is a friend of ours
Closed stations like yards in prison guards
Sending your crew back with no self esteem is our calling card
? till the days me and skills depart
I'm from a time when cats battle at night at ?
I'm takin' out doubles like open mics at Noah's Ark
I'm takin' out doubles like drunks at city bars
With preciseness of a surgeon
So don't be alarmed
If you awaken and I'm holdin' a
Scalpel and a dog
It just means I'm tryin' to see if you really got heart
If come back and you talk cause my fam will bandage 'em all
Cause when my fist hits your face
That's when your teeth are lost

[Hook] [x4]
Sterling Price not being nice is like no dots on dice
You wanna gamble your life
Bring your ass to the mic

Every time I open my mouth I bring my bank card[Intro: Kaos]
Yo, check it out. Uh, yeah. South side nigga. What. All my live niggas
What. All my live niggas. All my live niggas. Yo, yo yo

[Hook]
Launch a shot
Whether it's on or not
Guard your block
Beef then storm the spot
Alarm the cops
Stick you then pawn your watch
No fake shit, real MC's born to rock

[Verse 1]
Oh God, I get charged out of nowhere
Battlin' me is like Afghanistan, nobody want to go there
Especially when I'm charged off the cannibus toke
Puff the dutch too much, lungs damaged with smoke
You can front on the lyrics but you know they sound strong
I walk down the blocks these bitch niggas ain't found on
Diss me, get clowned on
That's how it happen
I bomb shit, no nonsense, my style of rappin'
So vicious
Perfect, flawless, no glitches
And after the show, I'm shacked up with yo mistress
Yo bitches!
I'm runnin' game heavily
To broads I'm Barry Bonds, I'm tryin' to hit 70
Memo came to me with the hot track
Said, "I heard you rock phat."
Asked for dope lyrics, shit I got that
Hardcore, fly the Condor
Who want war?
Impress the crowd and make 'em scream "Encore"
Niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Y'all niggas talkin' bout the street life but really couldn't live it
Watch your back punk, you might catch bullets in it
These cats pussy like Monistat, bomb your rap
Your album's faker than Michael Jackson's skin, I can't honor that
The hungriest
Technique like the drunken fist
Lyrical cunningness, all haters can suck a dick
I ain't adjust shit holmes, I beg your pardon
Don't address the Sargent, I bring death like The Headless Horseman
Raw rhymes like P, I'm Bout that
Me without skills, like the ghetto without crack
How's about that
I just snap like bra straps
Test me, I hunger for blood
Get your jaw tapped
Who dares to try to master
Walkin' fire hazard
Natural disaster
Blast ya
To you nerd fucks who think you mastered the art
Go back to The Yellow Brick Road and get you some heart
Plus lyrically, or on the street, you don't want the ruckus
I rain/reign on Tin Man MC's and leave them rusted
Metaphor forever raw, lyrical predator
Go to war like He-Man and Skeletor
And fuck wack, cause dope is all I settle for
I play the rap game until I get a better score
And right now my niggas lookin' like a blow out
Grab the mic and show out never hold out
No doubt

[Hook x2]

[Verse Three]
I've been in this shit since Rakim was Fiendin' for Mics
When gold chains was the shit, nobody's thinkin' of ice
When the music bang hard, no debatin' it's soul
Then the labels got shiest and took creative control
Now we got senior rappers
Low and behold
Gettin' rich off lies and borrowed flows
Can't record and snap
But I'm advanced like a cordless lamp
I make your crew look inferior with a chorus chant
So who want it?
I make the Earth lose orbit
Chicago talk shit and lose you life for it

[Hook x2]"I do some nasty shit" - Eddie Murphy
"Nasty"

[Intro] [Juice Talking]
Uh. Big Juice. 2 double zero uno. "Nasty". PNS. Molemen in the house
"Nasty". My nigga Memo in the house. Uh "Nasty"

[Verse One]
Ayo, this is how the shit run
The job I'ma get done
My sick tongue, spit one
Leave your whole shit numb
Bass go inside, coincidin' with the kick drum
Competition, just one
Victim, I lick one
Shot
The outcome, I murder for my income
Never to be outdone, the scale of one to ten son
Shit, I got good ones to great ones and then some
Cities, I ain't never been the type to represent one
I recite the poem cause I light your zone
And my home is where I roam on the microphone
Whenever the mic is on, I'm like Capone
I murder minus the syphilis
Rewind it when I kick this
Big Juice got flow as God is my witness
I scoop hot hoes and I'ma die with the slickness
When the spot blow, J slide with the sickness
Top flow
But I'm still down to ride with the quickness

[Scratch Hook]
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
Named Juice
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"

[Verse Two]
Molemen in the house
I'm well known for the free but my pen is just as deadly
I can come up off my dome if they behead me
Rappers need to slow down, I put the flow down
In your town I rule like I'm Judge Joe Brown
When it's all said and done, Big Juice will go down
As a vicious body puncher that ends it in fo' rounds
I'm one plane trip away from ruinin' your program
Compose for the hood like Rembrandt and Shopan
Men can't throw hands against me that's useless
I leave cats senseless, tryin' to call truces
But once they all defenseless, it ain't no excuses
I'm happy to commence if death is what he chooses
Anything J.U. touch, J.U. bruises
Winners don't pop the damn corks with the losers
I'm action
Either I can make 'em obey
Or like subtraction, the coroner can take 'em away

[Scratch Hook]
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
Named Juice
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"

[Verse Three]
I'm one step ahead of these niggas, I stay up
Most MC's hate every mic that J touch
To find me you gotta look way way up
Cause most nigga rap but they never say much
Like Nextel phones I can break y'all up
I roll with the heat that'll make y'all duck
I only squeeze once and I ate y'all up
My lyrics just fuckin' devastate, y'all suck
When my tec spray
Don't have your neck in my way
I'll have your broad readin' about your ass the very next day
Juice is bad to the bone like a fuckin' X-Ray
And I don't even spit unless I collect pay
I'm a flame in the game, can't wait to burn
But like gettin' a county check, I had to wait my turn
I must break you
So what's next for all y'all to follow?
These motherfuckers coughin' up blood like Apollo

"I do some nasty shit" - Eddie Murphy
Oh that was it?

"Nasty" [echo][Verse One]
I swear to God I'm hungry, plus blood thirsty
I paid dues, but if I don't make it who the fuck gon' reimburse me?
No one, so it's up to me to remain true
We came through to spark it with your lame crew in plain view
You fantasize that you might be a star
Thought you got open but didn't even get slightly ajar
I done seen your style before
A little talent and soul but when the pressure is on you fold
You couldn't take the heat I guess you had enough
See problem is, you don't wanna be the best bad enough
You ain't hungry like me my heart pumps rocket fuel
I stay on my own dick like playing pocket pool
Seeing me is like seeing microscopic molecules
Think not then son put up your profits and jewels
You'll be feeling me no matter what vocal pitch that I'm rhyming in
Style switch with perfect timing
And I'm outshining men with wordplay
I'm always in the lab
On the down low, seldom seen like deadbeat dads
A legend in the making and you can't be one
Cause it takes more than just skill to be a champion
It takes equal parts of talent, luck and ac'
Charisma, qualities you certainly lack
We two of the industries freshest rebels
We don't fuck with platinum chains, we deal with other precious metals
Example
I got a heart of gold
An iron will, balls of brass, nerves of steel
Words is real and Gee-Field can tell
That you don't stand a snowballs chance in Hell to advance and prevail
I'm making my point perfectly clear
That when cats is half stepping this year we persevere

[Scratch Hook]
"Listen, we here to give the hardcore what they looking for" - Xzibit
"Dedicated"
"To those who know the deal" - Talib Kweli
"It ain't a game"
"We ain't afraid to bring the war"

No other crew gets this nice
We pay dues kid we live this life
(We living it ch'all)
Born to rip mics and spit shit tight
I show you how to rip shit right

[Verse Two]
Peace to my man Cap D
Bobby and Tone B
Rap be
More than a hobby it's my only
Purpose in life
Ain't shit else worth the strife
But mics and perfect beats, not a search for a wife
And fuck 9 to 5 jobs
Punching time cards is last in line of my probs
See my squad's trying to defy odds
Design more hits than you find from Ty Cobb
Dimes and tight broads combine with nice [?]
The kind of fly snobs inclined to drive Saabs
Trucks with phat rims plus a black Benz
My rap friends live plush and stack ends
Fuck the fads and trends
We've been down since the Jacksons, Cold Krush and back spins
Spin it back
And now we must have revenge
For past sins for has beens of wack hymns
Grab pads and pens
Amass mens like sailboats when I drop paragraphs and Timbs
Smack rims off of ducks with glass chins
Scuff my black Timbs I'll bust the Mac-10's
Burn weak acts just like packs of Slims
For these cats seeking [?] hats and brims
Keep cats running laps like tracks in gyms
These gats got 'em doing jumping jacks and back bends
Leave 'em soaking like a contact lens
When combat begins, your life contract ends
What happens then? That depends
I could start swinging the ax and hacking limbs to fractions
And just chill, we mack slims
Sorta like bear traps attract skins to my lap like napkins
Then acts like captains and rap lords
Sip on half Coors
Piss on [?] boards
Leave my [?] jumping to pass ports
Wood grain dashboards or maybe a fast Porsche
But not if trash is [?]
And if you that type you on a crash coarse with my task force

[Scratch Hook][Verse One: Capital D]
I used to say c'est la vie, que sera sera
And wish that I could be this super duper rap star
Drive around the planet from New York to London
Take it for granted that it could never get redundant
Now where the fun went?
That dumb ish is played out
To hell with stunts and blunts and tryin' to stay out
I fade out from that lifestyle to retirement
Cause we all called to a higher environment
Than the club scene drinkin' down gin and juice
With a fogged mind, you don't wonder what your sin produce
Nine months later with a shorty though
And you still tryin' to cling to your 40, no
I want true mission and submission
And never say a word without the most high permission
Now listen, ain't nothin' deep for us to understand
Put the nonsense down and be a man

[Hook: Capital D]
Redemption
Peep science and reflect
And seek the divine, refine and perfect
Time we receive we really don't earn
So each day I promise to Allah to stand firm
What will the day bring? I don't know, can't front
But if I listen close God will tell me what He want
Now some say the message in their ear ain't clear
Maybe what He's tellin' you, you ain't tryin' to hear

[Verse Two: Capital D]
I see the straight path before me, but walkin' it is difficult
The nature of life is just just and reciprocal
You reap what you sew my brother
"But the times are tough"
"Yo, I know my brother"
To guard against sin, you see I gotta close ranks
And still coexist with all who give thanks
Become an old man and find a straight path
We argue over names, some debate and math
But you see God is one
One Earth and one seed, one word
So brother you must read
The information that you need has been written
Any knowledge I speak, is definitely bitten
So I'm a proud biter and reciter of news
A writer who will try to reach higher haiku's
Just a plain one, tryin' to shed a little light
As long as we're alive we can make wrong's right

[Hook]This is Prime
I got a story to tell, so listen
It's about a ??, City of Wind

Here lies the son of Chicago, city of wind, a pitiful place
Critics talk shit behind his back and grin in his face
Theres no visible trace of ?teen? spirit or grace
And nobody in town supports anything he creates
This shit is hater-ville, it doesn't matter that he's made of skill
Or that his beats is bangin, motherfuckers here will hate him still
Kids are runnin rampant tryin to recreate the ills
Straight killin tradition by dissin all those who try to build
He climbed the hills with pride until his mind was filled with certain laws
Observe the flaws in thinking with an inkling to reverse the cause
He's heard them all and finds that it's hard to teach
Then she replied ?believe? i'm fine and target it beyond the reach
An artist speaks, silence overwhelms the crowd
They hated him before, now they're hoping he can help'em out
Forget about his previous plights, and see the signs
Cause he is the beacon of lights and he is prime

It ain't about style
It ain't about rhymes
It ain't about skills
And it ain't about lines
It's all about life, maybe you'll see it in time
And then stop hatin on because I'm speakin my mind
It ain't about style
It ain't about rhymes
It ain't about skills
And it ain't about lines
It's all about life, maybe you'll see it in time
And then you'll stop hatin on because I'm speakin my mind

It's over now, see I got a little bit older now
It's time to play my part and represent this molemen hold it down
I didn't wanna lead the flock, I was happy on the streets and blocks
Corner cypherin, receivin props
I used battlin so I could sharpen my blade
So often, that it made me ruthless and they stated to hate
Around that time I just recorded a tape, Mind over Madness
Put some of my niggas on it, this shit was timed like I planned it
I made out like a bandit, because nobody was doin this
Except for my man pug cause everybody was new to it
We used to get treated in the greatest regard
I met a lot of heads and took a stab at makin a spark
Scam artists rest in peace, yep I was the one who started it
I took some known names and I chose to make them a part of it
Qwel, Verbal, and ?bust?, by chance you might have heard of them
They figured out the hustle, guess who the fuck they learned it from

It ain't about style
It ain't about rhymes
It ain't about skills
And it ain't about lines
It's all about life, maybe you'll see it in time
And then stop hatin on because I'm speakin my mind
It ain't about style
It ain't about rhymes
It ain't about skills
And it ain't about lines
It's all about life, maybe you'll see it in time
And then you'll stop hatin on because I'm speakin my mind

This motherfuckers has got me stressed out
Surveyin the landscape that I've stretched out
I wonder if the path I've chosen to walks the best route
Feelin left out with the rain poundin my brain
Without any shade, no matter, moves gotta be made
The city I'm livin in is simply crawlin with hate
The same kids who turned they back was eatin off of my plate
They just reminded me, it's time to eat, so finally
It's time for me to find a need to be the scriber with designer beats
To shine you need more than just sheer talent and confidence
Like heart and wit, mixed with soul to be a part of this
The ?words? I spit, reveal nothing more than a tortured man
With nothing to lose, I'm warning you not to force his hand
I'm takin no ?shorts?, I stand for what I believe in
Pullin wool from you eyes, and pullin wolves out of sheeps skin
Each minute I'm livin is given to all who listen to
The lyrics, the spirits, the art, it's part of the ritual

It ain't about style
It ain't about rhymes
It ain't about skills
And it ain't about lines
It's all about life, maybe you'll see it in time
And then stop hatin on because I'm speakin my mind
It ain't about style
It ain't about rhymes
It ain't about skills
And it ain't about lines
It's all about life, maybe you'll see it in time
And then you'll stop hatin on because I'm speakin my mind
