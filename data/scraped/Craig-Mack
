[Puff Daddy]
Bad Boys
Come out and play
You know we had to do a remix, right

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh, uh
Niggas is mad I get more butt than ash trays
Fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way
Ski mask way, nigga ransom notes
Far from handsome, but damn a nigga tote
(What you tote)
More guns than roses, foes is shaking in their boots
Invisible bully like The Gooch
Disappear, vamoose, you're wack to me
Take them rhymes back to the factory
I see the gimmicks, the wack lyrics, the shit is
Depressing, pathetic, please forget it
You're mad cause my style you're admiring
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring
You shoulda been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle you're bound to get shot
Not from Houston but I rap-a-lot
Pack the gat a lot
The flav's bout to drop uh

[Hook]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
Word up, no rap no crap you bore me
Wanna grab my dick, too lazy, hold it for me
I'm straight rap great
Busting heads, straighten dreads
I'm everlasting, like the toe on Pro Keds
A Tec-9 when I rhyme
Plus I climb, word is bond
Your album couldn't fuck with one line
It's been three years since you last hear
But now I reappear your heart pumps fear
To your gut, did your girl's butt
I scraped it, shaped it, now she won't strut
I smash teeth, fuck your beef, no relief
I step on stage, girls scream like I'm Keith
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rampage]
Twenty-one ninety-four
Mad motherfucking hardcore
It's my time to burn now explore
The flava in ya ear it's the boy scout
I make outs, I make other rappers have doubts
You're fucking with the wrong clan
And the wrong man, that's it
Now you got to get your dome split
I'm going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat, yes I'm just cool like dat
The dangerous, the ruggedness, from the Flatbush abyss
BLS 97 KISS bounce to this
I'm gonna live long in this rap game, niggas know my name
Yo Puffy

[Puff Daddy]
Burn 'em in the flames

[Interlude]
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Hee-shee, uh blowticious
Skeevee, delicious
Gimme couscous, love me good
Um damn, Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
I guess like the jeans - uh
Flavor like Praline, sick daddy nah'mean
Papa love it, when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It's all for you, it's really all for you
(Now what)
Hunchback, close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Flavors in your ass crease ha
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise don't cease ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast ha
Everybody, hey hey hey
You better believe it's Busta Rhymes the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State
Yo yo, hey hey hey
I'll split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious
I grant your wishes every time
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected is how we all connected
To break fool on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down I disappear, reappear and blow up
Everywhere, fucking with these flavas in ya ear

[Hook][Produced by Easy Mo Bee]

[Intro]
Yo Mack, I don't even understand how they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!

[Verse One]:
Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor be the badder chitter-chatter, madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my spit come out fatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MCs need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you and I bet the Mack take off like an MX missile
No more of your whining on the charts climbing
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhyming
I guess I'm gonna say Craig Mack with perfect timing
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Hook]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse Two]:
Craig Mack, 1000 degrees
You'll be on your knees
And you'll be burning, begging please
Brother freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MCs for dinner
You're crazy like that glue
To think that you could outdo my one-two
That's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
Cause boy, the rhyme you're kicking ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave
For the Mack the power pack in black making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Hook x2]

[Verse Three]:
Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MCs more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MCs shaking with this track that my man's making
Emcees'll run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MCs stop relaxing
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy watch the MCs I destroy and...

[Hook x2][Notorious B.I.G.]
To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker HEAR??
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin HER
The raw rapper, spine snapper
With the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-ah
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her
[Singing] Why you wanna.. play your games on me
[Rapping] Bitch, you crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggas on that real bloodspill shit
My rap-pin tac-tics are drastic
Stretchin motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigreeeee
You better be, filled with energy, niggas never gettin me
So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]

Hahhhh, AHHHHHHHH HAH

Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(Yo I just wanna get em)

[G-Dep]
Yeah, yo
Odds even, said shoot (blaow)
Asked me the reason, and I said loot
Man that's all I'm here for, therefore
When death declares war, you know what to prepare for
Shit, one for shelter, book flights on Delta
Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya
Cool - I guess your momma raised a fool
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school
Rap terror, shots through your new era
Get it together, y'all niggas shoulda knew better
I'm on point like acupuncture
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya
Left side, right side, witcha ho I might slide
Runnin wit this big guy, y'all niggas is pranksters
Don't make a nigga have to show you the pound
And show you the sound, that'll put you low in the ground
Just let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]

Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(What? What?)
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna funk a little bit)
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(Hahh.. I just wanna funk, what? Ahhhh)
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

[Missy]
I be like WHAAAAT? Let me clear my throat
Break the smoke, Missy gotta hit some high notes
HEYYYYYY! Yo from coast to coast I burn like toast
So dope that I floats through snow nig-guh
Oh, you don't wanna battle me
The agony be like, "Somebody help me please!"
Feel my pressure, never could a bitch flow better
In any weather, I'm Biggie bangin ya nigga
Ah-huh, I used to be the chick to lick the lollipop
Now I pop through your body parts
BLAOW, BLAOW, you like the way I interact
Proceed to smack, any MC that's wack
Ah-huh, microphone check one two
I do ya tool, like them freaks run through your crew
Give it to me, OHHHH, send it to me, OHHHH
But before I get down, where's my money?
Let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]

Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(Hahhh.. boyeee)
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(I just wanna funk a little bit)
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(Hahh.. I just wanna funk)

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Bringin it live to you bitch ass niggasAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Now who got the flav
That comes a dime a dozen
Thinking that is phat but wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack
(of Mackman)
Like Biggie Smallz might say
I eat'em shits like pac-man
I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables
Cause... I does what I do you
(Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin...macking ...full effect mike check one two
I'm a reign...rain forever
Rain like bad weather....reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style
Cause my style ain't a style
That is a style
So I can go buck wild
Betcha figure you got more funk for flow
It ain't so
Flava in Ya Ear letcha know
Now I'm about a second, from the Hook duk
Strap ya rap book
Before you get ya wet style shook

CHORUS
Can I get down
Get down
Get on down
Can I get down

The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MCs leaves a foul scent
See I'm like what ya call...king a yes ya'll
My style wreck shit...I mean real shit
Shit's thick..I come with the ammo
The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin
I wake great the lets warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to the stake
You sunk by domniate
See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buckus we roll with the cuf
No cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down....let me get down

CHORUS

To leap a tall building
Crush the earth-a-phone
But I'm sayin ain't no fair when MCs roam
The mic now in the right hands
Cause the Macks and the earths are the worthy of plans
More pep than the peppa thats in ya peppa shaka
Ruff earthquaker..couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring
With unknown to mad slang
With bigger bite than the double-bang
I ain't met boot to hand
If ya testin in ya lesson
Got me dressin for ya funeral session
Man.....It won't even matter no more
Craig in 94' just won the war
My style definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin look over in a four door Chevy Nova
(Why yi yi)
I figure its a slaughter
In the world of colins(?)
Ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter
The name of the track is Get Down
So let me Get Down and pound other MCs in the ground

CHORUS[Intro: Ghostface Killah]

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Monster cut truck balley shit
Champagne spillin while we hittin every bump that my Denali hit
Outfit is four thousand and better
The rhinestones in my flintstones look crazy in my sweater
Pah, it's not a big fairy tale that's my M.O
Fuck bitches on the reg' with no problemo
Iceberg, rabbits, in the Foxhills Mall
Where I coped two more, brought four for RZA
Bad Boy thank you for this special delivery
Catch me by the pool in my Tony Starks slippers
Wonder Woman armed, Ghost is intelligent
Made 30 off of dust dime I was killin 'em
Did cash on One-Sixteen I was feelin 'em
Them days kept a crisp coke dollar bill on 'em

Death pressin ya and ya like a hustler on the first ya need work
Stand by the grand high exhaulted
At your door with a portrait of the raw shit

On your cd, tape, and wax so stand back

Buck 50 your face and then butter your throat
It don't matter where you been or where you at

Phraseologist natural philosopher wordsmith
Authentical metaphorical lyricist
Sharp descriptive writer, kill a biter
Panty raider, party exciter

You couldn't move through my terrain, even in 4-wheel drive
And I'm your highness, finest
You hungry? Try this, buy this, livest
Uh huh, I take my rap style real serious
What you think it ain't...that serious?
I bang clubs and streets it's gettin hot
See Mack won't stop until Mack's on top
Young black america my CD drop
In two thousand and two, to change hip-hop
Most folks shake ya bones

My heat will cook you bwoyy, whooped you bwoyy!

So any time you're gettin low, 'stead of lettin go
Just remember that ant..

[Hook 2X][Frank Sinatra](Kids)

[Opps there goes another rubber tree plant]
(Opps there goes another rubber tree)
[Opps there goes another rubber tree plant]
(Opps there goes another rubber tree)
[Verse 1]
Now I came to rock, I came to move the crowd
I came screamin' out loud
No other choice is this bad new voice
Can't wait to sit in my new Rolls Royce
You soft and moist, sweet like cake
Don't be scared to lie down in the bed you make
And if you fake, I'm like Alexander the Great
A conquerer, stompin ya, for even steppin to the plate
Now you think I'm late but I'm right on time
You had your chance to do it now it's my turn to shine
Keep in mind, you ain't heard my flow in a while
And I still ain't heard nobody that can fuck with my style
Juliet child nigga cook MC's, Criag Mack baby 1000 degrees
Stand back nigga I'mma shake this place
And look just when you thought it was safe?

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 2]
Now inside the streets Craig Mack's a living Legend
Nucular weapon better watch where you steppin'
Story at 6 and see the film at 11
You can be Kit but I'm like Frank Drevin
Mary Lou Retton, flippin on yall
You can use Motrin, Advil or Tylonol
Just to see me ball make your chick wanna follow
Rock the Meadowlands you got Boo-ed on Apollo
Real hard to swollow wanna know how come?
Cause I'm hot-dog probably buring meat off your tongue
So from now on till thy king-don-com
The sea-son has begun from my style to weigh a ton
Kill you for fun but I ain't playin no games (no games)
And I ain't sayin no names (uh-uh)
But next time you kill somebody make sure they dead
But wait, you can check this in-stead

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3]
I see you made it to the bonus round, see my crown?
Pretty, too bad you can't touch it
I'm like Pompeii first time it erupted
Chicks still call acting hungry as a buzzard
You can let your man dump it hug it and love it
Touch it and rub it, Mack nigga, that's why it sounds undiscoverd
Explode like L. Ron Hubbard, on the Dianetics Cover, smother a brother
Been "Lethal" for years ask Gibson and Glover
Your man be like "Help!", lying in the gutter
Just like that, "Splash me the Cash"
Shit I'm like Duke Nukem get ready for combat
I now pronounce you man and wife
You may, kiss the coffin it's the end of your life Mr. Mack
And I know how to land this bird
Bet I see you 2000 nigga that's my word

[Frank Sinatra]
So any time you're gettin low, 'stead of lettin go
Just remember that ant

[Hook 2X]What da fuck's going on inside the biz
Shit ain't raw no more
Fake is how it is
I hear brothers talking 'bout shooting and killing
Then going home and chilling
Frontin' like a villain
Let me tell you something real
Is how the Mack feel
I ain't no criminal and represent no steel
I tell you one thing though
MC's better walk slow the Mack's on the earth
To let you know
I'm on a mission from the kingdom of God
To do away with MC's dat represent nimrod
You MC's have been too bad
So where you go now ice ya gonna wish you had
When MC's disappear it's my fault
It's time to put all the madness to a flying halt
And radio ya need to be ashamed
For pumping murder, murder, murder all up in
Our brain
I'll tell ya now Big Poppa don't like it
Representing truth when the Mack
Starts to mike it
I hope the subject don't turn ya away
But the whole Hip-Hop generation need to pray

Chorus
Whatcha gon do when God comes
You can front now, but when God comes
You can't get straped for when God comes
Cuz you won't know how to act, when God comes

Now we all established dat Mack's new king
And the king for his people has to represent the
Right thing
Brothers in the ghetto stop genociding
Cause same boat we riding, will do like the Poseidon
I watched the earth's cheese line get longer, I watch
Allegiance to Satan's army looking stronger
I watched drugs and guns take control
I even watched how the devil take the Black woman's soul
They ain't got respect no more
When your ass on the camera you ain't nothing but a whore
Ladies you need to help out your man
Instead of frontin' at the club with a drink in your hand
The Black family is now pre-history
And we don't need psychic healing from Dionne Warwick
We all need to be down on our knees beggin' please
Lord help us shake this disease
And MC's don't take these rhymes for no joke
Craig Mack pen is mightier than the sword
You stroke
So take heed to the words that I send
Cause on Judgement Day everey man must attend

Chorus

All our Black leaders are throwing on they war paint
I ain't seen a saint that might make me faint
How long can we sing that song
Knowing that the shit ya kicking brother is dead wrong
And don't figure Mack new to get started
Cause flip out an old fat verse from get retarded
I'm talking from veteran chair prepare
MC's nightmare only there's no need to fear
Shape up ya Lord about to strike
With thunder claps that turn day into night
With something similar to Gabriel's horn
The first flag up my tribe of Judah's now been warn
Peace to Bad Boy for bring me here
People of the world presenting Mack this year
No need for fronting his time has almost came
And the last rhyme ya hear bears Craig Mack's name

ChorusYou Are On My Mind, You Are On My Mind

[Chorus:]
Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
The Way I Feel Lately, It's Driving Me Crazy
Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
I Can't Get Over You, I Think About You All The Time

Can't You See What You Do To Me
I Think About You All The Time
My Mind Is Hazy And I'm Mixed Up Feeling Crazy Over You
Let's Not Waste Anytime

[Chorus]

Round And Round I Go, Where I'll Stop Only You Know
I Guess It's All In My Mind
Take Your Time Think It Over Let Me Know
What You Wanna Do, Baby It's So Good

[Chorus]

Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
You're On My Mind, Hey...

[Chorus x2: Fade][Produced by Easy Mo Bee]

You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Hook]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse Two]:
Craig Mack, 1000 degrees
You'll be on your knees
And you'll be burning, begging please
Brother freeze! This man's undisputed

[Verse Three]:
Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MCs more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MCs shaking with this track that my man's making
Emcees'll run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MCs stop relaxing
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy watch the MCs I destroy and...

[Hook x2][Intro: Tenn Buick]

Tenn Buick
Come out and play
You know I had to do a remix, right?

[Verse: Tenn Buick]

Let’s take it back to rope chains and Uptowns
When wack MCs would get blazed and cut down
With rhymes so virile and raw, they could impregnate
When you cut a demo, man that shit was a cassette tape
Bumpin' out the walkman, all these fake thugs had to watch how they talk man
Say the wrong shit and get lined out in chalk man, it's real
They used to only take a cut of record sales when you had a record deal (what)
And I wanna hear a track with that crazy flow right
So I’m on the phone calling up the radio like
I don’t wanna hear bullshit, play some past hits
No bitch assness or get your ass kicked
They forgout about punchlines and sick rhymes
Got these zombies singin' hooks, somebody call Rick Grimes
Hip hop ain't dead, I think that I could save her
But we gotta turn the old school into the new flavor

[Hook: Craig Mack]

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

[Outro: Tenn Buick]

Yeah
Tenn Buick
I bring that old school back baby (what)
I spit that old school crack baby[Puff Daddy]
Bad Boys
Come out and play
You know we had to do a remix, right

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh, uh
Niggas is mad I get more butt than ash trays
Fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way
Ski mask way, nigga ransom notes
Far from handsome, but damn a nigga tote
(What you tote)
More guns than roses, foes is shaking in their boots
Invisible bully like The Gooch
Disappear, vamoose, you're wack to me
Take them rhymes back to the factory
I see the gimmicks, the wack lyrics, the shit is
Depressing, pathetic, please forget it
You're mad cause my style you're admiring
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring
You shoulda been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle you're bound to get shot
Not from Houston but I rap-a-lot
Pack the gat a lot
The flav's bout to drop uh

[Hook]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
Word up, no rap no crap you bore me
Wanna grab my dick, too lazy, hold it for me
I'm straight rap great
Busting heads, straighten dreads
I'm everlasting, like the toe on Pro Keds
A Tec-9 when I rhyme
Plus I climb, word is bond
Your album couldn't fuck with one line
It's been three years since you last hear
But now I reappear your heart pumps fear
To your gut, did your girl's butt
I scraped it, shaped it, now she won't strut
I smash teeth, fuck your beef, no relief
I step on stage, girls scream like I'm Keith
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rampage]
Twenty-one ninety-four
Mad motherfucking hardcore
It's my time to burn now explore
The flava in ya ear it's the boy scout
I make outs, I make other rappers have doubts
You're fucking with the wrong clan
And the wrong man, that's it
Now you got to get your dome split
I'm going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat, yes I'm just cool like dat
The dangerous, the ruggedness, from the Flatbush abyss
BLS 97 KISS bounce to this
I'm gonna live long in this rap game, niggas know my name
Yo Puffy

[Puff Daddy]
Burn 'em in the flames

[Interlude]
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Hee-shee, uh blowticious
Skeevee, delicious
Gimme couscous, love me good
Um damn, Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
I guess like the jeans - uh
Flavor like Praline, sick daddy nah'mean
Papa love it, when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It's all for you, it's really all for you
(Now what)
Hunchback, close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Flavors in your ass crease ha
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise don't cease ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast ha
Everybody, hey hey hey
You better believe it's Busta Rhymes the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State
Yo yo, hey hey hey
I'll split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious
I grant your wishes every time
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected is how we all connected
To break fool on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down I disappear, reappear and blow up
Everywhere, fucking with these flavas in ya ear

[Hook]AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Now who got the flav
That comes a dime a dozen
Thinking that is phat but wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack
(of Mackman)
Like Biggie Smallz might say
I eat'em shits like pac-man
I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables
Cause... I does what I do you
(Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin...macking ...full effect mike check one two
I'm a reign...rain forever
Rain like bad weather....reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style
Cause my style ain't a style
That is a style
So I can go buck wild
Betcha figure you got more funk for flow
It ain't so
Flava in Ya Ear letcha know
Now I'm about a second, from the Hook duk
Strap ya rap book
Before you get ya wet style shook

CHORUS
Can I get down
Get down
Get on down
Can I get down

The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MCs leaves a foul scent
See I'm like what ya call...king a yes ya'll
My style wreck shit...I mean real shit
Shit's thick..I come with the ammo
The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin
I wake great the lets warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to the stake
You sunk by domniate
See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buckus we roll with the cuf
No cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down....let me get down

CHORUS

To leap a tall building
Crush the earth-a-phone
But I'm sayin ain't no fair when MCs roam
The mic now in the right hands
Cause the Macks and the earths are the worthy of plans
More pep than the peppa thats in ya peppa shaka
Ruff earthquaker..couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring
With unknown to mad slang
With bigger bite than the double-bang
I ain't met boot to hand
If ya testin in ya lesson
Got me dressin for ya funeral session
Man.....It won't even matter no more
Craig in 94' just won the war
My style definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin look over in a four door Chevy Nova
(Why yi yi)
I figure its a slaughter
In the world of colins(?)
Ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter
The name of the track is Get Down
So let me Get Down and pound other MCs in the ground

CHORUS[Hook]
It's alright
As you may have heard
To smoke the fat one and let the thunder burn
It's okay, to play this loud
Mr DJ, don't mean to sweat you down

[Missy]
I stuck my fingers in the socket, I blew up like a rocket
In the market, now I cannot stop it
Oh mami, oh papi, why they envy me?
Messin up my creativity with all this negativity
So now I'm drinkin gin-and-seng
Anything to mess with my concentration with hallucinations
Of invasion, from waiting on the nation
To get with my style
Cos I'm about to transmit into some funky ish
Can you get with this?
Zay, villaveu, yes, ugh!
They ask me if I'm nasty, they ask me, they bet me too
Like osh-kosh-bigosh, osh cock suck their cocks
Osh miss Miss iss oh shit
I gets mad styles, get it get it
I'm wit it wit it if you wit it, oh shit then let's split it
Into a 20 sack, and I'mma be back
Wit my boy Craig Mack like that, ugh!

Chorus

[Craig Mack]
Don't sweat me down
This jam needs a frontin MC, leave MC's shakin in the ground
Here come the rumblin sound
Worth more than the coke that they sellin by the pound
I walk the street like Shaft
Hop to kick a paragraph, floatin on the funk like a life raft
Down with Sista, it's the MC brezzle twister
Mackalicious boy I'll pop you like a blister
Craig Mack's a Jedi Knight with The Force of course
I can run MC's thru my teeth like dental floss
So back up and don't sweat me down
Boo docks on locks, fat boys nabbed the home town
And you can get the balls like that
Hittin wicked like the funkalicious rhymes that's phat, uhh
And we can get back in forth off the back

Chorus

[Missy]
Oh if, I could bring sucker-suckertash
When I farts I poops cash from my ass
Cos If You Think You're Lonely Now
Like Bobby Womack in gangsta format, I dunk shit like Shaq
I'm not greedy, I feeds the needy, I smokes a beady
I feel, the need to stroke the weedy
Oh big daddy, is you ready *slurp*
To slurp me in your mouth like spaghetti?
Hi Ho Silver, ya killer, my drug dealer
Fo' reala, I drinks some Miller, ugh
Look up in the sky ARGH ARGH!!
It's a birdie, yes I'm worthy for certy
Black eyed peas, all in my butt like fleas
Oh we's smell panties
All in my crack
My amplifier's on the maxi light, Kotter Welcome Back

Chorus [x2]Here comes a rhyme in your ear Craig Mack is here so have no fear
My rhymes push the hack to the rear
I'm severe rap pioneer with funk I steer now it's clear
Rhymes flow to the break of dawn
Exploring MC's I get silly on, like Ponce De Leon
Yet don't foget my style is a banger
MC's I deposit in the closet on a hanger
Mack chop your rhymes like I chop shop chop a Acc
Startin with the bones in your back
Whenever I attack it's like a blow from a axe
Sweet like sugar that be on Sugar Smacks
Facts is Mr. or Mrs
Can't another rapper see me when it's time for gettin biz
And the moral of the story as you will see
Is that from now on the greatest rapper is me

Chorus:

MC's you're jockin my style, you're jockin my style boy
You're jocking my style, MC's stop jockin my style
You know you can't touch the flav
MC's you're jockin my style, you're jockin my style boy
You're jocking my style, MC's stop jockin my style
Craig Mack has the phat funk flav

Now I'm sayin, rock funk to the Himalayan
No more delaying, MC's you decaying, I'm staying
Cause now I'm out my cage
And what I do for rap is gonna make front page
Remember back in the days I was just a tyke
I do a rhyme while I do a wheelie riding bike
But now I'm the man with the mic in my hand
Starving MC's like them kids from Siam
Breaker breaker, it's the funk rhyme shaker
Super duper superb slamming like a Laker
Swimmin on MC's like moray eels with mass appeal
Your rhymes are jokes like Dangerfield's
Boy, I'll tell ya, ain't no liver on this continent
I'm dope and you the opposite, the man when I be dropping shit
Raw, I give MC's a headache
Hit your ass so hard and kill your man by mistake
Youse a fake ladies and real niggas know
Non-stop rockin til it's time to go so bust the flow
I'm a be a round for a while
MC's stop jockin my style

Chorus

Now everybody put your hands in the air
Wave them shits like you just don't care, aiyyo
You could have a dollar or be a millonaire
Sometimes I think that Mack should be mayor
Now me, myself and I, we three bad motherfuckers
Here to eliminate suckers
I came to rock a party are you ready
Get your Aunt Millie's out eat MC's like spaghetti
Rap machete, I'll cut your ass like a sword
Into buying rhymes these rhymes you can't afford
I shine like jewelry, ain't nobody schoolin me
I battle anybody just point to who the fool be
Cause you and me, we ain't the same type of breed
I grab the mic and give the crowd what they need, and proceed
To rock the mic since a child
Get off my tip and stop jocking my style

Chorus[Notorious B.I.G.]
To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker HEAR??
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin HER
The raw rapper, spine snapper
With the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-ah
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her
[Singing] Why you wanna.. play your games on me
[Rapping] Bitch, you crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggas on that real bloodspill shit
My rap-pin tac-tics are drastic
Stretchin motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigreeeee
You better be, filled with energy, niggas never gettin me
So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]

Hahhhh, AHHHHHHHH HAH

[G-Dep]
Yeah, yo
Odds even, said shoot (blaow)
Asked me the reason, and I said loot
Man that's all I'm here for, therefore
When death declares war, you know what to prepare for
Shit, one for shelter, book flights on Delta
Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya
Cool - I guess your momma raised a fool
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school
Rap terror, shots through your new era
Get it together, y'all niggas shoulda knew better
I'm on point like acupuncture
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya
Left side, right side, witcha ho I might slide
Runnin wit this big guy, y'all niggas is pranksters
Don't make a nigga have to show you the pound
And show you the sound, that'll put you low in the ground
Just let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]

Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(What? What?)
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(Hahh.. I just wanna funk, what? Ahhhh)
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

[Missy]
I be like WHAAAAT? Let me clear my throat
Break the smoke, Missy gotta hit some high notes
HEYYYYYY! Yo from coast to coast I burn like toast
So dope that I floats through snow nig-guh
Oh, you don't wanna battle me
The agony be like, "Somebody help me please!"
Feel my pressure, never could a bitch flow better
In any weather, I'm Biggie bangin ya nigga
Ah-huh, I used to be the chick to lick the lollipop
Now I pop through your body parts
BLAOW, BLAOW, you like the way I interact
Proceed to smack, any MC that's wack
Ah-huh, microphone check one two
I do ya tool, like them freaks run through your crew
Give it to me, OHHHH, send it to me, OHHHH
But before I get down, where's my money?
Let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]

Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

More danger for metropolis we're droppin this
Funk weight that's greater than George Poppadopalous
Now even fools are better
Rap's new trendsetter, at makin MC's wetter
So plug in the mainline 'til ninety-nine
For funk the genuine now vote for mine (vote for Mack)
My voice be gettin hoarser and hoarser
From the way they take a picture MC (?) than a flyin saucer

[Craig Mack]
Peace to Brentwood Town Shipping
I'm smoother than that Lex your whipping
With the rack and pinion
And Firelli tires that be gripping
Sometimes I wonder if MC's really know
Mack's eternal bought to burn you
While in ten feet, of snow
I grab the mic and turn in-to Ali Baba
With just a dabber, my rhymes are guaranteed to grab ya
I got funk with the bass and soul
Cause I've been rockin on the mic since nine years old
And I can groove with that, stupid fat
Rhymers when you're soupin that
MC's catch a headache
And find where some Nuprin's at
I'm on the case like Magnum P.I., F.B.I
Lookin for a man with the reason why
And it'll cost more than Lee Majors
To fix MC's after I kicks my flavor
Puff and Puff and blow the House down
Is what the Mack do whenever I get down
Gettin down, boyeee (get down)
One two, Mack man's in full effect

Chorus: .75X + (rock on, rock on, rock on)

[Craig Mack]
Move with the funk
Cause we makes the moves on down
Kick the funk, hahhhh.. boyeee
I'm like the greatest rapper, known to man
Got MC's meltin in mouth and not inside my hand (c'mon)
And you can try to, write a rhyme-a
But the pace that I race'll have you lookin like a old timer (old timer)
Do you wanna pay a visit, to rhyme exquisite (aheh)
That'll leave you standin colder than a winter blizzard (AHH)
Mack's engagin, extra blazin
Who's you fazin? Power Rangers ain't more amazin (amazin)
Rhyme flipper, flip-a-rhyme=a-ripper (uh-huh, say what)
Rip-a-rhyme-double-dipper while you talkin on my zipper
I wanna know who's been naughty or nice
With the device, turnin grown men into mice (yeah)
I can flip funk back and forth, forth and back
Ride more super rhymes against the track, tell em Mack (tell em)
I got Bad Boy as my back (that's right)
As we kick on the funk called MC subtract
Got flow for days, got rhymes to amaze (uh-huh, c'mon)
Got the brand new funk, here's the brand new craze boyeee
Mack the dope (one two)
We break all of the funk on down (yeah)

Chorus

[Craig Mack]
Mo Bee, make it..
Bustin out, in the House
Makin moves, with the flavor
One two, as we get busier
We gon' get like this

Come on everybody, let's all get down
Got rhymes by the ton while you weighs a pound (whoo!)
Supercagafragalistic type of hyper MC
That be me, twenty-twenty could not see (can't see)
I don't feel the pressure, of an MC aggressor
That I got a rhyme for in my top dresser
(in your top dresser) Craig Mack, Bad Boy representin
Fat Funkster be gettin, for Fat Funk be hittin (c'mon)
It's this man's turn to earn
Since my birth, a penny now is MC's worth (c'mon)
And MC's are nuttin but a joke-a take a toke-a
Smoke fatter than the Ayatollah
Can't nuttin ever stop the Craig Mack plans
To grab MC's, and crush em in my hands (as we get busier)
Like I said before, here comes the Mack
Power-packed in black, to make you see mad graphics
(as we get busier) As we get busier
In nine-four with the funk that hits on the floor

Chorus 2X[Craig Mack]
How many know what funk is? Raise your hands
You ready for this world?

"I can get real raw.." plus my style is hardcore
I'm Craig Mack, comin in at your backdoor
My rhymes hit hard, no games like ping-pong
I'm strong (like who Craig?) Kong!
I'm flexin, what's next in, my funk track erection
My licks get the kicks like the Chinese connection
Like Damien, the Omen son, I won't run
I never ran, fryin MC's like the Sudan
Craig Mack is like a loaded four-five
Mothers get welfare, fathers won't survive
Yo who can get fierce as fierce can get, get set
I'm ready, to eat MC's like spaghetti
The C-R-A-I-G Mack is back
I've blown the world well known, the man's got it sewn
Zoom zoom zoom, zoom za-zoom za-zoom
Three years of waiting, now here comes kaboom
Back off the STEEL kid, let me get my dough
You're real slow, get the DICK like a homo
Got the name, no games, the outlaw
I'm real raw, plus my style is hardcore

"I can get real raw.." plus my style is hardcore (4X)

Service with the wild style, freak a smile
I'm crazier than ever, PLEASE pull my lever
Oooh I can't wait, I'm paid, I see him
Brothers on my jock, a G for per diem
MC's that are down please stay down..
CRAIG MACK FOR PRESIDENT! Fuck around
My nature's to hate ya, my style of MC'in
To dust and crush I bust every human bein
Dig it, I'm cool but one rule, don't act fool
My four-fifth's a tool, I have aim
Hey, hush it down, quiet, I'm speakin
Unique technique and style that I am freakin
Peakin, speakin like a deacon or a pastor
The master, baby, death, okay G?
Let's get back to the issue with judicial
Weepin willow grab a pillow 'fore I have to diss you
I'm concrete, hard as the street, like pavement
Leavin heads bleedin, strictly in amazement
Surrender, with more 'ups than Alcindor
I'll bend ya, you're tender, next agenda

"I can get real raw.." plus my style is hardcore (4X)

Yeah.. check this out
I belong in a hospital insane
Life fast lane on the brain like Bruce Wayne
A telltale won't fail or get stale
Cause I'm stuck like braille as I walk on a 3rd rail
Manson's my grandson, not so handsome
I'm grotesque -- FUCK IT -- girls still rub my chest
I'm G with James Brown, "Give it Up or Turn Me Loose"
I'm terror on the red lines, prank phonin Zeus
Craig Mack's the brother that attacks at random
MC's I slammed em, cause I'm fat as Ralph Cramdem
Ras, bumba claat, boy I kill ya
MC's I'm a thriller, from here to Manilla
Lay down, nothin but facts, jacks
The blackjack ace to the beatdown max
Relax, this is just wax on my single
More chips on my shoulder than the chips made by Pringle
So how do you figure? I'm stronger than your liquor
Wild Irish Rose, huh, strike a pose
I'm death to an MC, below like Jack Dempsey
A shark feedin frenzy, on those that tempt me
One more score for the war, SEE-YA!
I'm real raw, plus my style is hardcore

"I can get real raw.." plus my style is hardcore (4X)[Intro: Ghostface Killah]

Catch me by the pool in my Tony Starks slippers
Wonder Woman armed, Ghost is intelligent
Made 30 off of dust dime I was killin 'em

Go 'head and stand there and bump ya gums
If ya wan't the problem we can hurry up and come bury ya
I'mma play the courier

So any time you're gettin low, 'stead of lettin go
Just remember that ant..

[Hook 2X][Frank Sinatra](Kids)

[Opps there goes another rubber tree plant]
(Opps there goes another rubber tree)
[Opps there goes another rubber tree plant]
(Opps there goes another rubber tree)
[Verse 1]
Now I came to rock, I came to move the crowd
I came screamin' out loud
No other choice is this bad new voice
Can't wait to sit in my new Rolls Royce
You soft and moist, sweet like cake
Don't be scared to lie down in the bed you make
And if you fake, I'm like Alexander the Great
A conquerer, stompin ya, for even steppin to the plate
Now you think I'm late but I'm right on time
You had your chance to do it now it's my turn to shine
Keep in mind, you ain't heard my flow in a while
And I still ain't heard nobody that can fuck with my style
Juliet child nigga cook MC's, Criag Mack baby 1000 degrees
Stand back nigga I'mma shake this place
And look just when you thought it was safe?

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 2]
Now inside the streets Craig Mack's a living Legend
Nucular weapon better watch where you steppin'
Story at 6 and see the film at 11
You can be Kit but I'm like Frank Drevin
Mary Lou Retton, flippin on yall
You can use Motrin, Advil or Tylonol
Just to see me ball make your chick wanna follow
Rock the Meadowlands you got Boo-ed on Apollo
Real hard to swollow wanna know how come?
Cause I'm hot-dog probably buring meat off your tongue
So from now on till thy king-don-com
The sea-son has begun from my style to weigh a ton
Kill you for fun but I ain't playin no games (no games)
And I ain't sayin no names (uh-uh)
But next time you kill somebody make sure they dead
But wait, you can check this in-stead

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3]
I see you made it to the bonus round, see my crown?
Pretty, too bad you can't touch it
I'm like Pompeii first time it erupted
Chicks still call acting hungry as a buzzard
You can let your man dump it hug it and love it
Touch it and rub it, Mack nigga, that's why it sounds undiscoverd
Explode like L. Ron Hubbard, on the Dianetics Cover, smother a brother
Been "Lethal" for years ask Gibson and Glover
Your man be like "Help!", lying in the gutter
Just like that, "Splash me the Cash"
Shit I'm like Duke Nukem get ready for combat
I now pronounce you man and wife
You may, kiss the coffin it's the end of your life Mr. Mack
And I know how to land this bird
Bet I see you 2000 nigga that's my word

[Frank Sinatra]
So any time you're gettin low, 'stead of lettin go
Just remember that ant

[Hook 2X][Verse One: Treach]
Hey boo! Yeah did you remember the tip of tender fender bender
From last September you let me enter the center
So we went through the Winter
Then we had a little prob, now we let it solve
Now you think that you get robbed, if you're givin bod
Well I'm stickin to the kitten cause it's hittin
The only way I be splittin if you pick it for money and trick it
You wanna dip, this is the brick you pick
So you ain't dismissed until both sets of lips kiss
It's the mother number one the phunky Phillified
The chilly side, Boyz II Men and women with the illy vibe
So until it's nineteen ninety (nine)
Just vibe with me and smile like you wifey for life, B

[Bridge: Treach, Boyz II Men]
[Treach:] Too high to get over
[Boyz II Men:] Yeah yeah
[Treach:] Too low to get under
[Boyz II Men:] Yeah yeah
[Treach:] Too high to get over
[Boyz II Men:] Yeah yeah
[Treach:] Too low to get under...arm me with harmony

[Hook: Boyz II Men]
We're just, vibin
Groovin, vibin
We're just, vibin
Groovin, vibin
We're just, vibin
Groovin, vibin
We're just, vibin
Groovin, vibin

[Spoken over Hook: Craig Mack, Puff Daddy]
[Puff Daddy:] That's right
[Craig Mack:] Just move it on down
And you came to feel the flav
[Puff Daddy:] Bad Boy, Bad Boy
[Craig Mack:] Haa!  We just vibe to the beat
[Puff Daddy:] That's right
[Craig Mack:] The Mackalicious funk flav
[Puff Daddy:] Gotta get the cash
[Craig Mack:] Ah one two y'all!
[Puff Daddy:] Gotta get, gotta get the dough

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
Craig Mack's got a lot in store for MC's so please listen
Fake rappers stop booin and hissin
My shit's the bomb, like nitroglycerin
Electrifying, if I said I wasn't I'd be lying
On the fader, from here to Grenada
Dope demonstrater creator of the force like hey Darth Vader
You imitator, I'm greater than your data
MC's run up so then they pack this doggie bag for later
I'm the, wisdom-mystical
Hyper-scientifical
Do your typical write rhymes get loaded take a miracle
To lyrical whip, the word dick on the side tip
Rhymes to flip, Hercules ain't got a tighter grip
Whoever said that you couldn't be beat?  Well have a seat
Grab a spoon, taste some defeat
I shake MC's down directly to the ground
Boyz II Men make the world go round

[Hook]

[Spoken over hook: Busta Rhymes]
How ya feel?
Party people, how ya feel?
Let me know if everything remains real!
Word up!  Tell me how ya feel!
I feel good tonight, talk to me tell me how do ya feel
So that everything's alright
Word is bond!  Busta Rhymes keep it comin one time for your mind
Flip Mode y'all, yo

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
WHOOOO! That music feel my cool breeze
Make you bang your head from hear to overseas, now!
You feel the charge that we be generatin, conversatin
Always get taken by vibes that be penetratin
I make you feel the sensation like we come into
The last days of Revelation, sometimes that's how we be vibin
Yes I'm gonna keep you smilin
Hit you then I take you on a ride just like Coney Island
One two three it's simply you and me
While you listen I MC
Blow your mind and make you really want to par-ty
Ohh ohh! Take those bars and keep em swingin
Ohh!  Sometimes it makes me want to start singin
But I keep on bringing ...
... and swinging you better believe I keep your bells ringing
Feel the motion and the magic potion while we in the dancehall
With Boyz II Men we bring the universal vibe y'all!
Bring the universal vibe y'all
One time, Flip Mode is forever
Y'all get down and feel my thing
Guaranteed to make your fat butt swing
One time while I get on

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Method Man]
Here come that real rap shit
Criminology, yeah
I mentally stab your brain with the pain
While other brothers spit mad game I spit flames
You know my fuckin name, write joints with Mary J
Johnny Blaze get methed right because it pays
Life insurance indeed as we proceed
To give the track menstraul cramps until it bleeds
Who the bad guy?  It's I, the chinky eye
Knotty-head, rugged MC, from N.Y
City, my whole rap committee get busy
My roots date back to Kizzy, now ask who is he?
Lady sings the blues then, I take it as a gem
That's able to raise Boyz II Men
A thousand, young black kids from out the housing
Projects, ready to catch wreck, Ticallion
The center of attraction, guaranteed satisfaction
Stop the yappin make it happen babyWhat da fuck's going on inside the biz
Shit ain't raw no more
Fake is how it is
I hear brothers talking 'bout shooting and killing
Then going home and chilling
Frontin' like a villain
Let me tell you something real
Is how the Mack feel
I ain't no criminal and represent no steel
I tell you one thing though
MC's better walk slow the Mack's on the earth
To let you know
I'm on a mission from the kingdom of God
To do away with MC's dat represent nimrod
You MC's have been too bad
So where you go now ice ya gonna wish you had
When MC's disappear it's my fault
It's time to put all the madness to a flying halt
And radio ya need to be ashamed
For pumping murder, murder, murder all up in
Our brain
I'll tell ya now Big Poppa don't like it
Representing truth when the Mack
Starts to mike it
I hope the subject don't turn ya away
But the whole Hip-Hop generation need to pray

Chorus
Whatcha gon do when God comes
You can front now, but when God comes
You can't get straped for when God comes
Cuz you won't know how to act, when God comes

Now we all established dat Mack's new king
And the king for his people has to represent the
Right thing
Brothers in the ghetto stop genociding
Cause same boat we riding, will do like the Poseidon
I watched the earth's cheese line get longer, I watch
Allegiance to Satan's army looking stronger
I watched drugs and guns take control
I even watched how the devil take the Black woman's soul
They ain't got respect no more
When your ass on the camera you ain't nothing but a whore
Ladies you need to help out your man
Instead of frontin' at the club with a drink in your hand
The Black family is now pre-history
And we don't need psychic healing from Dionne Warwick
We all need to be down on our knees beggin' please
Lord help us shake this disease
And MC's don't take these rhymes for no joke
Craig Mack pen is mightier than the sword
You stroke
So take heed to the words that I send
Cause on Judgement Day everey man must attend

Chorus

All our Black leaders are throwing on they war paint
I ain't seen a saint that might make me faint
How long can we sing that song
Knowing that the shit ya kicking brother is dead wrong
And don't figure Mack new to get started
Cause flip out an old fat verse from get retarded
I'm talking from veteran chair prepare
MC's nightmare only there's no need to fear
Shape up ya Lord about to strike
With thunder claps that turn day into night
With something similar to Gabriel's horn
The first flag up my tribe of Judah's now been warn
Peace to Bad Boy for bring me here
People of the world presenting Mack this year
No need for fronting his time has almost came
And the last rhyme ya hear bears Craig Mack's name

Chorus[Intro: P. Diddy]
Check this out
See where I'm coming from
The sun don't shine forever, you know the rest

[P. Diddy]
I ain't no joke, I used to make the mic smoke
Now I'm like, Kain, Rob, and Dep make sure it's broke (that's right)
The most around come through toast your town
And I'm the Bad Boy poster child (Bad Boy baby)
Now fool around girl do somethin with it (uh-huh)
Now that's cool girl move somethin with it (that's right)
And anything I talk I live it (yeah)
And everything as been like grining? (yeah)
Talk to 'em

[Black Rob]
Yo, this the Bad Boy mission and we got the goods here (here)
Play 'em to the left cause my right's my good ear (ear)
Trying to reach levels of a ill subliminal
Hoes know the fact that I'm a criminal (that's right)
The movie I'm facing, cutie looked Asian
One night, I bet she be off the hook paging them
(Singing) Soooo amazing, she's been waiting

[Chours: P. Diddy, Foxy Brown]
[P. Diddy} And we! We gonna take the crown, please
And we! Killin them clubs please believe
[Foxy]     And we! Rock L.A. to New Heezy
[P. Diddy] And we! We can get fly and get greasy
[Foxy]     And we! We pull up on them big things
And we! We make they ass and hips shrink
[P. Diddy] And we! Blind them with that bling
[Foxy]     And we! Rock ya body, rock, rock, ya body, body

[Big Azz Ko]
The untoucha, put you on your butt quick
Same thing you was taught not to fuck with
Fontaine the flame, the game with the pain
And maintain the same eye frame I came with (that's right)
Same shit, new day, same language, new ????
??????with a +Tech+ like +Sway+
The shit 'round my neck like Dre
Think what your chick might say
[Female: Bad Boy]

[P. Diddy]
My aim's to change the game cold (yeah)
Been doing this since chains and Kangols (uh-huh)
I hold foes to paint like Van Goghs
Leave niggas on "what up" stank like mad hoes (oohhhh)
Choppin' it down, cockin' the pound
Splat gate, vacate, niggas locking your town

[Craig Mack]
Hey yo
Don't try to play me for the same, same, same (as we proceed)
Last week you did it, caught a beating the same (to give you what you need)
(Underlapping chorus) You goddamn right I'm with the fam'

[Chorus]

[Kain]
(Overlaps last line of chorus)
Yo, spit that diva flow, fast slow, either o'
Keep that on a need to know
Freeze that so the milk ??? deep ????
Y'all can get beat, speak or go let the speakers blow
Stop acting like a half-a-fag
You don't wanna be shitting in a plastic bag
Gotta big green mit with a matching Jag (damn)
Bad Boy bitch, laugh at that motherfucker

[Foxy Brown]
I thought I that we won't stop (we won't stop)
I thought I told you Fox stay shotgun in the drop (Foxy Brown)
Take that rap game or rape that
And anything I feel I state that
I'm blatant like that (she blatant like that)
Can't feel bouncing right back
Fuck y'all bitches hating like that
Y'all niggas take heed when Fox rap
Bitches wanna dress just like that, the Sean Jean dress just like that
And I don't be frontin like that
I might just cock the hatch back, push the Bentley top back
I'm a Bad Girl at heart, shoulda made the move from the start
Bitch front bet the llama'll spark
(overlaps G. Dep's first line)
Motherfucker

[G. Dep]
??? the one who started the trend, be the first to reserve a the rims
So the insides match my Timbs
Make 'em say no fair, try to ball I'ma end your career
Like a can of Lysol put my name in the air
Say it, don't spray it might wet them up
Might push the panic button don't press your luck
Know the name G. Dep, I'm ghetto dependent
I'm in the hood like carburetors and engines

[Chorus]

[Outro: P. Diddy]
Don't stop now, let's go
Don't stop, let's go
Don't stop
We starting over

*Beat fades out{*scratched: "One by one I'm knockin you out" - Schoolly D*}

[Craig Mack]
Do... do you have it what it takes, to be a Street Fighter?
Street Fighter, Mackalicious fat funk flav'
For ya headphones, bwoiii

(LOOK!) I bet you thought you could beat Blanka
Mo' flav' than the chocolate made by Willy Wonka
Zangief'll hit you harder than a Tonka
Truck bet a buck USSR will stomp ya
Now M. Bison had this plan
And had the hostages inside the palm of his hand
Now we all know Dhal's the man
But in the world of rap Craig Mack'll turn ya into sand
Jane, haircut like she spent a summer at E. Honda's
Stomach wonder in four digit number (chomp, chomp chomp chomp)
I got Sagat on the spot just to rock your knot
He got kicks like I got rhymes to the sho' shot
A Street Fighter, funky rhymer, drop-a-dimer
Bound to action pack, yo Jack, greatest-of-all-timer
Here comes the hook again~!
Mackalicious that po' flav' will make your hair Ken

[Hook 2X: Craig Mack]
Do you have, what it takes, to be a Street Fighter?
{*"One by one I'm knockin you out"*}
I don't think you have what it takes to be a Street Fighter
{*"One by one I'm knockin you out"*}

[Craig Mack]
Momma don't let your babies grow up to be MC's
Cause they'll freeze (freeze 'em up Mack)
I got this real strange disease
That makes knees bend like hurricanes do the palm trees
Now Dhalsim is slim hittin harder than a Timb
Whem the rubberband man gets in
Peace to Balrog as I kick the monologue
Thicker than fog and heavier than Boss Hog
I heard Vega got Spain locked down
With tournaments, with ornaments underground
And Chun-Li reportin, with real brain distortin
Kicks fix your back for back brace supportin
And knees bend for Ken, no pretend
From beginnin to the end, Mackalicious rhymes'll win (everytime)
And call yourself a fighter if you wanna
But you'll be a type of fighter lyin all up in the corner
Mack you can't bite-a, silly overnighter
Flake-ass rhyme writer, Mack's a Street Fighter (here it comes)
It's time bwoi (bwoi, as we get down)
As we bring the funk on down for Street Fighter

[Hook]

[Craig Mack]
A Street Fighter, ain't just a game no more
Too raw, you'll get kicked out the back door
If fightin fo' position is your mission then keep on wishin
(Keep on wishin and hopin and prayin and..)
I mean this man on the mic got mo' flav' for days so listen
(So listen up with the funk)
I'm out with these be-about rhymes that the Mack'll shout
Punchin through bricks and turnin bodies out
A Street Fighter, is now in the house
Type of hype that will amaze, Street Fighter brand new craze
(Brand new craze~!) As we get on down
Street Fighter moves leave another fighter in the ground

[Hook] with ad libs

[Craig Mack]
Ah hahhhh bwoi!

{*"knockin you out" - scratched to fade*}[Craig Mack]
Aww shit, here come the man again
You know if you can't with the style that's goin on right now
Then you need to be sittin down

If MC's can't get with the style that's goin on
Then you need to sit down

Do your thing Mack, do it to 'em nigga! Ahh whassup?
What you don't know, what you don't know, kick 'em in the grill

"But anyway, I'd like to take this.. anyway, I'd
Anyway, I'd like to this time out to bother you"

Oh no no no no
No I don't think you can get liver than me G
So sit back, relax, Mack's about to attack
And turn your flav into Similac cause it's like that
I kick funk out the frame, make it insane
With all local stops set to crumble like a (?) train
My thickest format, my format's thicker all that
No comp for combat with bwoy like Supercat
Show you where my head's at I crack you with a bat
Where the funk? Hear the trunk a bit and fat knit(?)
Rearrange the skit make it fit so you can't sit
Now ain't that some shh.. I rip it
I snap a jaw, I stabba jab a dinosaur
Live from Creedmore under the floor
It's like the roughest of ruffnecks, wicked and (?)
Check the (?) MC and his project
All you brothers need to know doe
There's no more best MC cause that is now me
See, G, I am king MC
Once said from me can't another brother disagree
Got the funk bleedin all out your trunk
And there's all there is to it (that's all there is)

[Hook: repeat 4X]
If you can't funk with the style that's goin on
Then you need to be sittin down

[Craig Mack]
You must got no brains in ya head
I kill ya dead on the spot with the hits I got
Trust my flavor G, I make ya wanna pee-pee
I got what you can't see, somethin like a leprosy
I slow it dowwwwn, somethin like.. this
When it's time for me to stun 'em
MC's I warned them..
I'll put 'em on the moon without funk to listen to
Then again, my vibration
May give the sensation they're on vacation
Y'all brothers need a (?)
Real rugged alligator MC hater from the fader
You little tic-tac, tryin to act like a lumberjack
Sit back and watch how the earth crack
You funk around, you lay around, that's how it goes
And I suppose MC's still wanna try me
King of the mountain is a hard rock
Do you understand, smile and I'll take you out like the mob
Check it black, after the Mack there's no recoup
Not even soup, get out shake the hula hoop
Comin out the ground..
Gettin down..

[Hook]

[Craig Mack]
Sometimes alone I be writin
Must be frightenin, to hear I'm on the air
But I don't care, (?) 'til I'll see you sick(?)
Son, grandson, no tellin when I'm done (no tellin baby)
I'm about do you and you on some new
Who has a date and thank you for waitin
There my bad, I thought you took a beatin in the brain
Then you learned from rap that rap's a mistake
You won't get a break
Big as a cake for me to make, and you bake
So, banzaii, here comes the flyest guy
That you ever heard in your lifetime (yup yup yup)
I do a behind..
And rewind, I wanna kick some more shit
Down your faucet, I pours it
Mighta lost it, but then I retrieve it
Believe it, I got this fat okey-dokey style for a while
Peace from the king
Peace from the king G, here it go
One time for your motherfunkin mind

[Hook]

Sittin down, bwoy

"Anyway I'd like to take this time out.."
"No more music by the suckers"Craig Mack

AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Now who got the flav that comes a dime a dozen
Keeps 'em buzzin' thinking that is phat but wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack (of Mackman)
Like Biggie Smallz might say I eat 'em shits like pac-man
I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables
Cause...  I does what I do you (Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin...macking ...full effect mic check one two
I'm a reign...rain forever, rain like bad weather
Reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style cause my style ain't a style
That is a style so I can go buck wild
Bet'cha figure you got more funk for flow it ain't so
Flava in Ya Ear let'cha know
Now I'm about a second, from the hook strap ya rap book
Before you get ya wet style shook

CHORUS: Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down

The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MC's leaves a foul scent
See I'm like what ya call, king a yes ya'll
My style wreck shit, I mean real shit shit's thick
I come with the ammo
The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin
I wake the great lets warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to the stake you sunk by dominate
See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buck us we roll with the cuf
No cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down, let me get down

CHORUS

To leap a tall building, crush the earth for fun
But I'm sayin ain't no fair when MC's run

Q-Tip
Lemme tell you what they do when those MC's run
They either run and get their boys or they run and get their gun
Here I stand, the rawest of the raw
We from the Queens town without the floor or flaw
All of the sudden niggas is bustin' and frontin'
Talk about your busting titles when we're your idols
I'm looking through your minds corridor, you every though transpires
Through the Tribe's attire
We Bad Boys to the heart and post
That Tribe Called Quest, you follow us like coats
Position like a Beamer, y'all need to stop froggin'
If a catch a glimpse it's in the SP loggin'
You name brand tip, what's goin' on love
You know shit is tough and we coming through bugged

Craig Mack
The name of the track is get down
So let me get down and pound all these MC's in the ground[Craig Mack]
Hah!
My momma said back when I was born
That you was warned, so now your ass gets torn
(Wake it up Mack)
My style is bonafide
Fortified on my bad side, an MC on a high
Now we about to set this off
Bass and funk rattlin (one two) send MC's up North
I never had to fight with the mic
I make the funk so dynamite
So parasite MC's might wanna bite
Welcome to 1994 (welcome) beats that thump
Rhymes that's bumpin now at your backdoor
Never figured Mack got funk for days (what)
When "Project: Funk Da World" brought the brand new craze
(wake it up)
And MC's can't get one line
When the genuine take out deep max on your mind
I'mma hit you with the boom pow
Bolder than Moscow, MC's your judgment's now
Here it comes

MC's.. your judgment is.. now (now MC's)
MC's your judgment day is now (it's time, here it comes)
MC's.. your judgment is.. (hahhh) now
As we get down - MC's your judgment day is now
Here it comes, boyeee

Here comes the one they call King MC
If you're tired of those phony fake rhymes that be (fake)
I'm back with this deeper than Minds of Minolta
Preachin better than preacher up on an altar
(Amen boy)
I feel that I have pardoned, pardoned
No need for bad grammar startin in my MC garden
(chomp chomp)
And I'mma kinda hungry tonight
So I pulls out the ground a fat rhyme to recite
I don't means to boast but the most is me your host
On post, kickin flav til they ghost (ghost)
Craig Mack is here to stay
Rugged as a mountain bike on MC judgment day
(go ahead)
From now until the Earth's gone
In the chess game of rap, MC's ain't nothin but a pawn
(your move)
As the rap romps through your town (through your town)
And MC's around, time to put your panties down (put it down)

MC's.. your judgment is.. now (it's time)
MC's your judgement is now (MC's, check your clock, it's on)
MC's (MC's) your judgment is.. (hahhh) now (Mack the dope)
MC's your judgment day is now (with the flav, gettin down)

It was a rumble tumble, I put the bee inside the bumble
Kickin wicked type of hyper, won't never fumble (ahh)
I float like a tugboat do
Watch the virus, Mack the dope, start affectin you
Is rap real? You can't deal, what's the matter?
The badder the Don Dadda is still gettin fatter
You be lovin how it sound and shit
And have you dance when I battle for the sponsorin
And you can thank Bad Boy for that
A technique for layin MC's on the mat
Scat, scoot, pussy couldn't make a louder hoop
When I pollute, the world with funk to the roof
Mad rhymes we bust, in God we trust
And MC's don't discuss when ya turn back to dust
(Ashes to ashes)
Mark the year, 1994.. when MC's hit the floor

MC's.. your judgment is.. (hahhh) now
MC's your judgment is now (Final Call, MC's, we get down)
MC's.. your judgment is.. (here comes the Mack) now
(to clean house) MC's your judgment day is now, boyeee
(Here it comes boyee, it's time, hahhh.. ahahHHHHH, boyeee)
