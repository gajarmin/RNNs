[Vers 1: Angel Haze]
Okay I’m Rambo I ramshack
I’m next to that cheese like rat traps
On top of that green like grass ass
That’s over y'all head like snapbacks
I get it where I fit in, put up then I put in
Tryna find an ass I can put my fucking foot in
Run this shit no I run this shit
Don’t give one fuck bitch I done this shit
I did what I say I did
Did not fabricate one bit
I have been the fucking realest since my exit near the clit
That’s where I was born fuck what you on
All about me bitch fuck what you doin'
Round of applause bitches slap me with some clappin
Show my whole fucking ass like a fat bitch in chaps
But I’ll be running that shit like a motherfuckin' tracker
Like a run-on sense like a motherfuckin' chopper
Like a cheetah in the jungle but I’m motherfucking faster
Like a pre-teen boy in the church with a pastor
Hold up I’m not serious I’m just playin — psych!
Fuck your opinion bitch I mean it when I’m sayin that

[Hook: Angel Haze]
Money and more money is the only shit I’m after
You can cut the fake shit
I’m not a motherfuckin' actor
I’m on top of my green like a motherfucking tractor
You niggas you ‘bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
I’ll be on that other shit got that from my other bitch
She come from an island or a desert or some tundra shit
I am multi-faceted, bitch I do a ton of shit
Like I’m diarrhea or whatever's sitting under it
I’m nasty, I’m insane, I’m too much, I spit grains
I came from the fuckin’ bottom
I’m top now, I shit flames
I kick shit, like dope shit
Like no shit, like oh shit
Get in my way I fuck up everything
Like ho shit
See, they said that I wouldn't
I do whatever they said I couldn't
I’m not the one to be fucked with
Or to be tough with
I be on your head like duck, duck, duck bitch
I be in the air like pump-pumped up fists
Nah, I’m like up-chuck like gut fish like hands up my skirt
Like when you gon' let me fuck bitch

[Hook]

[Vers 3: Angel Haze]
I’m an undefeated bastard
My tongue is the fucking rapture, bitch
I be at my peak, I am not the one to be mastered
I’m the one to be after, I’m sweeping you while I’m dusting
I just popped up out the blue, I’m spontaneously combusting
Spit a little different, give me just a minute
Beat the beat down bitch, fresh it then I kill it
We are not the same but they don’t really get it
Tell ‘em do the math, hoe—fraction, division
Sick flow sick ho, drop me in the clinic
Eat 'em 'til the end 'til they back at the beginning
Cause I ki-ki-ki-kill it ‘til it’s flat dead
And never pass a rock like a motherfucking crackhead

[Hook][Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I tried to take the time to become someone's inspiration
Turnt up to the max, but talked about education
Preached how marijuana was the healing to the nation
Tatted Bob Marley face to help me through all my phases
This living life shit is startin' to take a hold on me
Started out with verbalizing poetry
Murdalizin' any instrumental anybody tried to throw at me
And that's when hip-hop started to grow on me
You could say that I'm proud, cause I wasn't followin' crowds
I was stuntin' on all them niggas that was runnin' they mouth
Surpassed my expectations on anybody with doubts
Feedin' niggas the truth, why you niggas lookin' spoofed?
The beginning to gettin' what I deserve
Cause in this life of sin, you only winnin' when it's earned
So niggas gettin' handouts is liable to burn
Yeah, you could shine now, but it's probably gon' die down
So when it quiet down for the day
And you broke cause throwin' money seemed cooler than tryin' to save
Nigga be a man, make a plan, be a better nigga and
Try to find a way to make a way, keep it G

[Verse 2: Logic]
I keep it real all the time
Like my crew when I rhyme
Just a killer in his prime with that predator state of mind
I'm set to detonate
Stack my bread and watch the paper escalate
Don't test my fate, Logic finna blow like Mary Kate
I play my role like Shakespeare, RattPack ain't no fakes here
I conceal my talent like a 357
Ever since I was 11 been a G, chillin' on the low key
Incognito, manipulate the steel like Magneto
Smackin' suckas like mosquitos, dispersin' verses like a free-throw
I'm Michael, the king, you fuckers is Tito
Versace frames with the green shades, I only see dough
Ballin' like a free-throw, you know my steelo
I once was a prince with the vision of a king
Now I run the whole thing, not defined by the bling
Exterminatin' fakes like crooked jakes killin' for high stakes
Guaranteed that it's my fate to be remembered as one of the greats
No matter what it takes, I'mma give it my all
Like Jordan when he ball, never stumble, never fall
Lyrical medicine, repeat the formula until I get it right like Edison
Now step into my mind as I calculate lyrics like Einstein
The way he manipulated numbers, I manipulate the rhymes
Like E equals MC squared, na
E equals eater of MCs, beware
Watch me shine in the darkness like a flare
Married to the game, I'm the heir to the throne you've been watchin'
I know a lot of people lookin' at me
Like who the hell this white boy reppin' VMG
Racially I'm no different from Cole or Young Drizzy
Just a half-breed born to succeed, now what you need?
Visionary, RattPack, Young Sinatra

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
I am like magic, I am a classic
Puttin' heat to these bitches like I'm ironin' fabric
Can't satisfy the appetite of a savage
So I'm eatin' 'til I'm at the top, openin' passage
Openin' passage always so drastic
I, kill the shit and have them bitches holdin' a casket
I am on point, bitch I'm verbally cactus
And it's my turn now like a rotating axis
Tell 'em I don't hold my tongue for no one
I'm a fuckin' asshole, so forth, so on
And I rap circles 'round bitches, I got 'em runnin' in relays
Had they jaw dropped in the same position for three days
I hear them hoes hatin', I got a proposition
Until you come, hoes, you ain't no competition
I put bitches in a bag, be next
I'm comin' up like gag reflex
These bitches on my sack, t-dip
I'm givin' out sneak previews, free clips
Y'all bitches don't want the drama
I end your sentencin' like colon, comma
Call me misses take the lead to these bitches
On tracks like glue to the weave of these bitches
I take 'em all in like I'm breathin' these bitches
Then put a couple drinks up the sleeves of these bitches
I'm killin', best believe I make 'em bleed in these stitches
I can't believe you really be believin' these bitches
Damn, dead is how I'm leavin' these bitches
Watch 'em all get sonned like I'm breedin' these bitches[Intro]
Now, this might get a little personal
Or a lot actually
Parental discretion is advised

[Verses]
When I was ten, shit, I believed I could fly
I would just flap my fucking arms and try to meet with the sky
And in my mind I'd envision that I was speaking with god
And then I'd chop his fucking fist off and beat him with mine
But this is just a fucking portion of the war with my mind
So I'mma take you fuckers back and through the vortex of time
When I was seven envision me at the bottom of stairs
And I solemnly swear that this is the truth, no fallacy here
See I was young, man, I was just a toddler, a kid
And he wasn't the first to successfully try but he did
He took me to the basement and after the lights had been cut
He whipped it out and sodomized and forced his cock through my gut

See it was weird because I felt like I was losing my mind
And then it happened like it happened millions of times
And I would swear that I would tell but they would think that I was lyin'
And now the power that he held was like a beacon of mine
So now I got used to it, I put up with the shit
And now my hate was so volcanically eruptive and shit
But this is nothing cause I guess he told his friend what he do
And they ate it up, shit I was like a buffet for two

And then it happened in a home where every fucking one knew
And they ain't do shit but fucking blame it on youth
I'm sorry mom but I really used to blame it on you
But even you, by then wouldn't know what to do

And now it happened so often that he was getting particular
And I'm more scared every time, word to my speed and ventricular
One night he came home and I was asleep in my bed
He climbed on top of me and forced himself between my legs
He told me: "Hey Ray, I see you like them Popsicle sticks so put your mouth on my dick and fucking swallow the spit"
And I was confused but I was scared so I did what he said
I had no idea the effect it would have on my head
My heart was pumping it was thumping with like tons of my fear
Imagine being seven and seeing cum in your underwear
I know it's nasty but sometimes I'd even bleed from my butt
Disgusting right? Now let that feeling ring through your guts

I thought of offing myself, I thought of killing these niggas
Wanted to take a fucking brick and push they teeth through they liver
Wanted to smash the fucking world and burn its leftover parts
Wanted to rip it out and just fucking step on my heart

Then I grew up and I wasn't within the reach of these men
But that didn't keep me out the motherfucking reach of my sin
And psychologically I was just as fucked as they come
I was confused, I had to prove I wasn't fucked from the jump
I was afraid of myself, I had no love for myself
I tried to kill, I tried to hide, I tried to run from myself
There was a point in my life where I didn't like who I was
So I'd create the other people I would try to become
Sexuality came into play and with as scarred as I was
I was extremely scared of men so I started liking girls
I started starving myself, fucked up my bodily health
I didn't wanna be attractive to nobody else
I didn't want the appeal, wanted to stunt my own growth
But there's a fucking reason behind every scar that I show
I never got to be a kid so that's as far as I grow
My mental state is out of date, and that's as far as I know

My biggest problem was fear, and what being fearful could do
It made me run, it made me hide it made me scared of the truth
I'm not deranged anymore, I'm not the same anymore
I mean I'm sane but I'm insane but not the same as before
I had to deal with my shit, I had to look at my truth
To understand that to grow you've got to look at your root
I had to cut off the dead, I had to make myself proud
And now I'm just standing living breathing proof look at me now
I made it through everything, I made you look like a clown
I'm fucking great, can't fucking hate, you nigga look at me now

Now I'm just saying this to tell you there's a way from the ground
The makings of a legend are often hidden in trials
Just be strong and just move on and just accept what you can
Because it makes your story better when you read at the end

[Outro]
Yeah, there's a story behind every single scar that I show
I made it out, this a me nobody's gotten before
I had to open my wounds, I had to bleed til I stopped it
Thanks for joining me here as I cleaned out my closet
I said I opened my wounds, I had to bleed til I stopped it
Thanks for joining me here as I cleaned out my closet[Hook: Sia]
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Oh-Oh
It's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Oh-Oh

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
It seems like yesterday that I was nothing
Then all of a sudden I'm a volcanic eruption
Then all of a sudden it's like spontaneous combustion
And I'm all up in your face, yelling
"Bitch, you can't tell me nothing"
Cos I came from the bottom
Now everybody's watching
I said it was my time
Now I'm who everybody's clocking
And I'm just out here sprinting
I'm running right through my vision
I'm trying to outrun my past
But still trying to defeat my limits
Cause you only get one moment
In this life to be great
And you give it your all, despite what it takes
And you never let 'em kill you
You take take everything they give you
And throw it right fucking at 'em
And tell 'em it doesn't build you
And no it don't ever break you
And no it can't overtake you
Life's like a bed of roses
You take the thorns and you make do
Sometimes you have to hurt
For the cause to be reached
But one day you'll be stronger
Than all that you beat, and you can say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
I woke up one Sunday morning, stopped believing in Jesus
Stopped believing in churches, I stopped believing in preachers
I realized I was a teacher, not just one of the heathens
I'm going to destroy the fallacies, start creating believers
Start creating the leaders, tell them who should they follow
Nobody but themselves, especially if they hollow
Especially when they empty, and death reserved for fulfillment
You the only person alive that holds the key to your healing
So you take it and you run with it
And keep going even when your sun's hidden
Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain come
Is where we often find the light soon as the pain's done
There ain't no material things in the world
That can change the fact you feel alone
Despite the fact that it gets hard, you take it all and you still go
Take the sun and you still grow, lose your light and you still glow
I been there, I'm still here, and I know how you feel, so

[Hook]

[Bridge: Sia]
We don't wanna fight
So sing with me a battle cry
Sing with me a battle cry
Oh-oh
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Oh-oh

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
It's hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it
A minute in my position filled with my opposition
To anybody not different fighting to stay the same
I got lives in my hands and I'm fighting to make 'em change
Couldn't accept responsibility, find somebody to blame
The emotions that I'm harboring 'bout to drive me insane
Tried to say "Fuck everything," but I ain't have the heart to
Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to
So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing
Inspire life into anybody that's forfeiting
Cause it's easy to keep pretending that there's nothing wrong
But it's harder to keep their head up and be fucking strong
So, now they telling me "Go, Haze, they can't stop you
Heavyweight flow, if they can't lift you then they can't drop you
The pinnacle, if they can't reach you, then they can't top you
Man, they can't do anything, that you're about to"

[Hook]

[Bridge][Intro: RZA]
Ay yo, it's the BET Cypher
The Man with the Iron Fists edition
Film out November 2nd yo
But right now check out these new hot weapons right here
Driicky Graham, A$AP Rocky, Angel Haze, Childish Gambino and Joey Bada$$
C'mon, splash em son

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
I came here with one intention to kill this
I'm talking head in my hands, mouth on that drill ish
I be on that wired insane, ultimate trill shit
And there is not a soul that can see me
Like I'm not real trick
Listen up niggas I'm tired of you lames
I'm hungry and you looking like entire food chains
And uh, it's to the point that I ain't even got to try hard
Spittin' like a lake in hell, but bitches like my God
Plus niggas flicking lenses on me like a tripod
'Cuz they know there's only one eye, like cyclops
You know I beat 'em to the count, to the points love
I swear I never even lost in a coin toss
So bow down mothafuckas, if you talking deep shit I’ll out drown mothafuckas
Somebody find my rocker cause I'm literally off it
I'm in the murder business I just spit you bitches a coffin

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Yo, til the day I die, I be puffing lye
Fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move, cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you can see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you'll unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul
Probably you know I found mines right through the pencil
Started bodying flows, but fuck that
This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to Squeal
This one for my people, heading to the top, no re-do
Thinking up evil but see no evil just be Knievel
You can't be this good they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me better
See, God made three Bigs, 2 Pacs but he only made one era, The Era

[Verse 3: Driicky Graham]
Swear you guys slipping like some ice on a bridge
Since diapers and bibs
The light skin has been quite nicer than how Mike was to kids
Cypher rhyming, Rikers Island, spending nights with the pen
Either that or cyber-Skyping with a dyke and her friend
She telling me, she gon' take my cock to her lips
Suffice to my wish, saliva and recycle my kids, gulp
I'm the best, its hard to lose hope
I'm spitting rappers out like orange juice pulp
And looking in the mirror like aren't you dope
You so clean motherfucker you should hardly use soap
Something sinister, raps that minister
You mortals don't want combat, I'll block and finish ya
I'm seriously dope, I'm crack, I'm venomous
And you are seriously poked in your crack by ministers
Eww, these days rappers on my TV
Are braggers about their swagger rocking karats off of Ebay
But I ain't tripping, I like groupie women
Who be sendin' chills up your spine when you see they booty switching
Fast cars with the kufi missing, that's top off
Pop off, I'm with my dawgs like Stewie Griffin
Niggas hear me, be like ooh he be ripping
And if your girl see me she catch that Driicky spank me, do me feeling
Over the money I be pooky twitching
And honestly about the beef I gives a fuck what who be Twittin'

[Verse 4: Childish Gambino]
Still good with a pen, no Joe Paterno
I count Ninja Turtles, my cash flow concern them
Gambino you meet him, repping east side of the A hard
Got the Black AMEX, I gotta pull the race card
Niggas move that Kreayshawn, naw I don't carry mine
Why the game fucked up like my hairline
Ay girl, you ever smoke a bowl out with Kid Cudi?
You ever gotten D like you don't study?
Rap game in the fast lane, with a gas tank
Filled with half of these trash lames
I have to say I'm such a Joey's last name
Bino boy, why you spit so mean
Why the flow so rich girl, them sweet sixteens
He on BET and he got White people problems
"Like, Whole Foods doesn't have the juice I like so I have to go to, you know
Trader Joe's and have it shipped to me"
Victory, history
More G than a kid's movie, Royalty

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
My name is Rock in the new drop, my destiny's to be the new Pac
That nigga Rocky gotta die, he too hot
It’s dead on, must've been tripping and stepping in heron'
Cause I’m cripping the lead on
I’m getting forensics twisting your head on
Traffic, mad clips, caskets, pass this, ashes to ashes
That shit, backwards, tactics
Bitches only like me for my status
Living ghetto fabulous and I’m still acting ratchet
Twenty-four karats, no dressing with my salads
Nigga with the Patch kids, steady talking cabbage
Got a chick red like radish, have it
Bitches think they bad til I drop them like habits
No one in this cyph' has swag like I do
Church with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel
Ever since a baby, ask my old lady
My first four words was, fuck you, pay me[Verse] (Woodkid)
Where the light shivers offshore
Through the tides of oceans
We are shining in the rising sun
As we are floating in the blue
I am softly watching you
Oh boy, your eyes betray what burns inside you

[Verse] (Angel Haze)
You were a maze to never be completed
And I fell through cracks in all your little secrets
But your grip won’t let me free and closed eyes won’t let you see
That out of everything you are arises mystery

Back to the intro, back to the back of the back of the door I watched you close
Colors washed by the endless tides, by the end of the cycle faded slow
Back to walls with the holes punched in by the ends of a fist with knuckles swole
Back to the chick that lost control, back to the pain that can’t be shown

[Hook] (Woodkid)
Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me too?
Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?

[Break] (Angel Haze)
Everything I feel for you, swallowed salted tears for you
Is there any chance you can feel this too
Now my heart’s a bid for you, you put all your quid onto
I just want you to make me a part of you

[Hook] (Woodkid)
Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me too?
Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?

[Verse] (Angel Haze)
Or can’t be seen or can’t be felt
Or can’t be shared with no one else
I chose my shade, I made it green
I lost myself, when I made your team

Back to the name I’ll scream forever from a place that can’t be home
Safe from the grasp of the rage ensued by a thought process that can’t be slowed
Where ill be when you realize, I can’t say
But dawn goes down today and nothing gold can stay

(But dawn goes down today and nothing gold can stay.)
(But dawn goes down today and nothing gold can stay.)

[Hook] (Woodkid & Angel Haze)
Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me too?
Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?[Verse 1]
Uh
I’m running, running through the jungle
Running like a slave through the underground tunnel
Told y'all niggas better get these bitches
Cause I spit till my lips need 16 stitches
I am lyrical intrusion
You bitches can’t see me like I’m really an illusion
I hop up on your face and do my motherfucking two-step
Till I knock the meat out like a motherfucking toothpick
Uh, I’m nasty nigga, like Nas, like Kim, like Cassie pictures
Like I’m fucking Chris Stokes or that Raz-B nigga
Or the skin on the feet of a ashy nigga
I am whatever they say I am
Bumping like the asses on them thick bitches at Stadium
Fuck them other bitches I sound better in the place of them
I killed this shit, this the motherfucking requiem

[Hook]
Sick bitch, chicken noodle soup face
Calls from overseas like a motherfucking crusade
Crack rock and you can hit it till your nose hurt
Rooftop Brooklyn, made this shit in Covert
I run New York, I run New York

[Verse 2]
I am zero past a hundred, spitting like a dragon
That went missing from a dungeon
Y’all a bunch of niggas getting trippy off of nothing
Tie a rope around your neck and let me kick you off a bungee
I’m satan, and I’ma take your ass to church now
Running my fields and you midgets on your first down
I love it when these bitches know I’m better than them
Cause I don’t hear, not a word or a letter from them
I’m a fire in the midst of a forest ‘round bitches
And I rap elliptical orbits round bitches
Anaconda, I sit with an open mouth, bitches
And you bitches are lyrically
Like some fucking down syndrome, no offense
No shade 'n all, but y’all bitches on knees like babies crawl
You can catch me out in Covert, chilling like a stoop kid
Yeah I hear you, don’t talk bitch, do

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a lyrical criminal general
Take shots, but never subliminal
Don’t stop, ever continual
Running and running but never in intervals
Can’t even stomach the shit that I’m finna do
Y'all niggas want the shit that I’m giving you
If you front, I’m gon' put and end to you
I’m like Scorpion, bitch I will finish you
'Make It Nasty', real real nasty
Why you bitches running like you will get past me?
Won’t happen, you bitches could get on, when I’m off it
Try to cross me now, you be gone in a coffin
It’s just me, myself and I
Talk tough shit and I’ma beat you till you die
Ask why? Because I’m better than you’ll ever be
That’s why my shit make your shit seem lighter than Heavy D

[Hook][Verse 1: Angel Haze]
Yo, I'm abuse to these bitches
They endure domestic violence
Flowin' loud like the roar out the mouth of a lion
All these hoes get delete, even when I ain't watchin'
Puttin' all ya'll careers in a custom made coffin
Yes, I'm a problem
Fuck the confusion
Success is like a lonely ass road to seclusion
Me, I'm prepared for it
I know I'mma tear thru' it
I'm about to blow up like balloons with some air thru' it
Tell them what I don't give, 10 fucks
Dead skin and they bout to get nip/tuck
Mines like a bullet, I kill you if I shoot it
Perfected my craft
The best go, cool whip
Fuck this game while I'm cummin' in it raw shit
Overlapping bitches who runnin' it like they jogging
Ready or Not
Im comin for you bastards
Whippin' nigga's asses they finna call me "Massa"
Yo, My flow so massive
Fuck out of my space ho, NASA
Point is that I'm on point and the pointed to flex on you bitches like I'm fucking double-jointed
Yo, Ya'll all over
On top of my green like lawnmowers
Shit, I am ahead
Ya'll all shoulders
Get the fuck off my clit
Ya'll wallholders[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
We're never done, we found a place where we belong
Don't have to stand alone, we'll never let you fall
Don't need permission to decide what you believe
And jump, down on Jump Street

[Hook: Angel Haze]
Jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Work hard, play hard
You may not wanna quit your day job
Undercover, on the loose
Don't let 'em recognize your face card
This king shit, the team equipped
We 'bout to empty out like three clips
Got a mean grip on this street tip
Tearin' up the club like 3-6
We out of control, all over the place
And somebody gotta put it to a stop, quick
Out on the road and all up in your face
You better know we steady lookin' for the drop, bitch
Yeah they'll crack the case and yeah they gotta crack it fast
They're the Jump Street and 'bout to jump up in your ass
This the special unit that's designed to keep it quiet
We infiltrate the dealers and we find the damn suppliers

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
Your friends'll be there when your back is to the wall
You'll find you need us cause there's no one else to call
When it was hopeless, the decision is what you need
You better be ready to, be ready to jump

[Hook: Angel Haze]

[Verse 4: Angel Haze]
Don't be afraid to die
A lot of bad guys should be afraid to die
Got Schmidt, Jenko, the whole damn crew
Same ole same ole with a whole lot of new
You know there can't be love without an inch of pain
It all goes hand in hand like yin and yang
In the city but I'm mothafuckin' sky high
Tryna find a new drug called WHYPHY
Wait, we just here tryna find us
Schmidt went lookin', 'til he found love
Got his life sweet, bon appetit
Spring break, bitch, throw a party on the beach
Shit did change, but all that means
Is that your real friends don't ever leave
Will it ever be complete?
Jump Street won't ever ceaseShut up and let me talk
I said shut up and let me talk

I'm better than whoever motherfucker
Better than whatever motherfucker
Better than a better motherfucker
That was better motherfucker
Yeah I'm better than whoever
When I step up in this motherfucker

This right here on behalf of the haters
I don't give a fuck cause my act is the greatest
I put my foot into the ass of the greatest
And shred they ass like they passed through a grater

I pinch my teeth
I'm trying to hold back a mental beast
Straight jacket on my tongue
Brain in the facility
I'm like the motherfucking stinger of a killer bee
All about my benjies, legs of a centipede
I'm sorry but I body every track
Make 'em stop and hold they breath like cardiac arrest
I slaughter 'em to death, I kill them fucking bitches
There's a lot of girls out there, a sea of fucking fishes

Wordsmith, I ain't never gotta try hard
Be good to they ass like I are
My track record is a killer for a pop star
My AKA is "the best by far"

My life is a job, trying to stop me is an occupation
Beat 'em to a pulp, O.J., concentration
Never win if I'm who you trying to beat
Swear it'll be a blowout, like the sigh of relief

I kill niggas
Gone from the bottom of the dirt I be big real, niggas
Bit off the chain then I beat 'em with a whip
'till I turn these hoes to feel, niggas

I swear to god you never get up on my level ho
Tell 'em kiss my ass and call it mono from a stereo

Came up from the bottom like a back with a hump
Always been the realest in the last of the bunch
Over everything like Shaq when he jump
Chew these little niggas like sticks of gum
Eat em with my mouth, straight Captain Crunch
If they don't say shit, ma ma ma

Verbally destructed, I'm spitting like it's a whirlwind
Outside of my box, I'm fitting to put the world in
You do not add up, don't think you can do the math, stupid
We are not the same, equal sign with a slash through it
Walk up in this spot, the hoes scream till they throat is gone
Like I'm not human, like I got two extra chromosomes
Pull up in that new shit, they get they Ford Focus on
All these kids follow me, I get my hocus pocus on
Don't know what to call me, super fucking dope or something
I'm killing them niggas, I must be the shit they choking on
If they copy a style, I must be the one that they quoting from

Nestle bar flow, I get nutty when it's crunch time
Eat the best of everything like cutting in the lunch line
Beater ass bitches know, they don't want the beef or nothing
Pull they eyes out they sockets, they don't gotta see me stunting
Whole fucking wolf, I ain't posing like I'm a sheep or nothing
Hanging outside of their door, like a wreath or something
You bust shots, I got an army brigade
That put the heat to niggas chests like LeBron and Dwayne
Niggas call me Haze Horus, there is only one eye
Getting closer to them pussies like the top of the tie
Spit from the bottom of shoes, it's entirely soul
And bitch, I'm about to blow like "fire in the hole!"

Why don't they get it, I won't stop till I'm finished
Said I will not fucking stop till I'm finished
I'm better than holding and won't you admit it
I'm over the bill like the top of the fitted
Get the fuck out, I'm don't stop I'm not quitting
I'll murder this shit, have a job then let's quit it

Mind state overgrown, Scarface in the corporate zone
Put them in the batcave, I eat them till they're carbon bones
Nobody is fucking with me like I'm in the world alone
Ain't nobody like me, Facebook is dead and gone
Fucking neck-breaker, make 'em turn until they head is gone
They worry 'bout them Edward Cullen, son they may be dead at dawn
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, I'm a fucking monster
I'm a shot of Hitler, Guevara, mixed with some Josef Stalin
My girl come from America but she look like islands
My dude look like Tyga, but he think like Common

Have you not got the time, motherfucker stop playing
Money on my mind like it sits on my brain
You will lose so be on my team
If it hurts to be sick, I ignore my pain

Now tell 'em who be killing shit, I'mma get a copyright
I'm so fucking good, I'd probably win in a cocky fight
You niggas can't copy right, you forgot to credit me
You niggas ain't picture perfect, you don't got no editing
They speak it and they let it be, yeah that's right they let it be
The line at the top is long, like the letter D
You fuck with my money, I murder your mummy
And then I throw the twos up like the top of a bunny
Got the fucking world jumping like the drop of a bungie
Then I snap and kill niggas, Crocodile Dundee
Nobody is scaring me, I'm the fucking monster coming
After niggas running like a motherfucking comma
Shit ain't pretty when I spit it but it's better than you ever looked
Giant to these bitches, six foot seven footI've seen meadows become mountains of pride within me;
Witnessed the light within the darkness inside befriend the helpless soul that I've become
And even in my weakest phases
My darkest days are often brighter than the lightest rays you could feel me burnin' through the shade
But, I'm convinced that I ain't changed

My close friends say if you press rewind and look at Haze the person that I am now is not the same
I tell them when seasons change everything else has to fall in line, become aligned
I feel like I've lost my spine, I thought that conquering the minds of this troubled youth would get me through
But it seems as though I've forgotten me to get to you
When all you needed was the truth

There's often great trouble in contemplation
That tendency turns fascination into a permanence
One I hadn't been sure I was prepared for

But you never know what you're prepared for until you're standing within that time
And the only thoughts within your mind are "I wanna win. I don't ever wanna have to worry about making it here again, so I gotta be just like them."

Creating subcategories;
I don't fit within the persona that fits with them
I've become you
True in a sense, but, I lie all the more
And confidence is the key that unlocks every door
That way you'd never know I felt this; You'd never know I feel it
With my Spider-Man senses I can hang upon the ceiling and hold my head in shame
Look from whence I've came

My eyes are brightening the cave within the dark slow lives behind
There is emptiness where my fears reside
I am a queen and a Pharaoh
I am the villain and the hero
I am death and I am life
I am lows as well as highs
I am truths within the lies
I am a heroine and a zero
I am too, altered ego
Welcome[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
If you’re contemplating suicide, this is for you
See this is for the moments when ya alone and with emotion
So fucking bold leaves you mentally frozen
When ya cold and alone heart open and broken
When that loves outta sight and your hearts into focus
When ya floating in oceans hopeless soaking in misery
Headphones on you link yourself with the synergy
When you watch your mind and ya lost in a song, be strong
You are not alone, I just want you to know you are not alone

[Hook]
There's angels in the airwaves tonight
And I've been running all of my life
And I need you to stay, I need you to stay
Angels in the airwaves tonight

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
This for all the moments when your weakness is your cloak
And people you love most just beat you to a pulp
When you cut open your wrist looking for loving in the slits
But find nothing but self hate cause nothing exists
See this for all the moments when they don't understand
And they ain't where you stand
And they can't comprehend
They just staring from the outside
And then they judging your in, when they
Kick you and beat you and hurt you then leave you
Laying on the ground like you half of they equal
Gladly defeat you then laugh to your face
When you feel all alone, when ya so outta place
They can't relate to this pain
They don't feel how I feel

[Bridge: Angel Haze]
So don't get lost tonight
Never let the ignorance cost ya life
You can make it, keep ya fingers crossed tonight
Put your headphones on and turn off the lights

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
When the girl that you love won't look in your direction
When the guy you like adds you to his fucking collection
When you all dressed in black
And they whisper and snicker
And they make you feel wrong for being so different
This for everybody who knows what it is
To feel like nothing but a memory that won't be relived
That distant fucking shit that everyone forgets
The words on the tip of tongues that gets swallowed with the spit
See I know how it feels
I've been there before
I had head in my hands and my heart on the floor
I've been worthless and shattered
I've been nothing to people
I know what it is to have to force them to see you

[Bridge 1: Angel Haze]

[Bridge 2}
I've been running now
I'm outta here today
I've been running now
Questioning my faith (x2)
There's angels in the...

[Verse 4: Angel Haze]
For when you feel so invisible you're not even sure you exist
So you cut yourself open just to see if you real
You numb yourself with drugs just to hide what you feel
You drink the washed up pain in hopes of rejecting it afterwards
You live everyday wishing you could rewind your life backwards
Because you wanna figure out where the fuck you went wrong
Cause everything in your world ain't been right for so long
I know how it feels
So this is for you
If you're thinking it now
If you're wanting to die
If you're thinking it out
You are so much more than you are in this moment
You never know how great you can be
Don't give up on you
I didn't give up on me[Intro]
April's Fool

[Verse 1]
Dead skin on the flesh of your halo
Drunk love on the breath of an angel
Time frozen in the ash from your blunt
And you breathe like you had life trapped in your lungs
And you wanted escape, and I wanted to take
Every thought from your mind and just throw it away
As I've watered you've grown
I've deflowered your soul
You a seed that I planted with a thought of a rose
And I thought I'd impose if I ever had the energy
And I would save somebody if I ever had the memory
I cleared up some space and invited you in
You were brown and I tried to make you violet again
And I brought out the sun and the violence of wind
And I tore off your thorns and they died in my skin
Yeah
And I watched you, become beautiful
It's funny what the dirt does, when it's suitable

[Pre-Hook]
I don't mind being April's fool
The flowers came when the rain made you
Honest hours having spent with few
But I'll be April's fool for you and

[Hook]
I'm April's fool
And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat
And I took you to the grass and made its bed
Then I bathed you in my love until it sprouted
And I'll never get the thought out of my head
I'm April's fool

[Verse 2]
Yo
Freeze frame cause the view is so cinematic
And the opening to you was so hemorrhagic
But my first mistake was thinkin it was easy
And that you'd love me if I really let you see me
Deep thoughts in the abyss of your brain cells
One shot to wherever your pain's held
And it became something I'd never seen before
And now my heart too small to beat for anything but yours
Though my perception's is varied as your shade change
And the burdens gettin heavier than weight gain
And we kept swallowing the sun until the shade came
And kept on knockin on the clouds until we made rain
All the flowers in the garden share the same range
And a rose by any color share the same name
But I love you in a way that will not cease
Cause you're hideous in ways I cannot see

[Pre-Hook]
I don't mind being April's fool
The flowers came when the rain made you
Honest hours having spent with few
But I'll be April's fool for you and

[Bridge]
I'm April's fool
If we take the flowers stem and walk into the rainbow
Remember to water them and watch how quickly they grow
But as quick as clouds come in and drown them in the rain so
We can take the potters  and anoint them with the same ho
And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat
And I took you to the grass and made its bed
Then I bathed you in my love until you sprouted
And I'll never get the thought out of my head


I'm April's fool[Spoken Intro]
"I remember being asked a lot, by a lot of different writers, zines, and shit, like, 'Why don't you incorporate your race, your ethnicity, where you've grown up, into your music?' I don't identify with that shit, like, my identity is the music, everything you need to know about me is in the music: my home, it's where I originate, it's where I fall apart, it's where I come to life."

[Verse 1]
Back in the booth let the tragedy in
Switched up the team, let the magic begin
Told all you haters, I'm in it to win
Way back when them losers wasn't letting me in
All of these bitches is mad at me, so?
Money appeared now they magically foe
Honestly really can't pay it no mind
Because spending that time means I'd rather be broke
I'm out here living my passions and more
Witnessing peace as it pass through my soul
Nothing can irritate masses like literally showing them stagnance can turn into growth
Haters gon hate when you winning this shit
Done for these bitches, they tend to forget
I'm out here yelling 'bitch, look at me now!'
I was underground, now I'm stuck in the clouds
14 whole hours, a trip out to Spain
High in the clouds, bitch I'm gulping the rain
Just a year later still fucking these haters
While facing my fears, no more running from pain
Head is on straight so I'm gunning with aim
No more fucking with bitches who stunting for fame
You can catch me out roofless in something deranged
Ain't it funny how suddenly something can change?

[Hook x2]
You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down

[Verse 2]
Back when the preacher said change is to come
All nonbelievers prepare to be sonned
Not talking Jesus but honest to God
I bet I reach my prime before air leaves my lungs
Switched it up bitches, adjusted my flow
Go against me and get wrecked from the go
All of you bitches keep taking your shots
But if one come at me, then it's straight for your throat
Harder than nipples on bitches aroused
Deity swag and omnipotent style
Don't fuck with my bread and don't fuck with my head
Cause if it get to that point then I'm seriously vile
Promise you people that evil's alive
Wish you could see what I see with my eyes
All of the demons that be in mind
So I burned all my bridges and cut all my ties
Said I would do this back when I was 9
Said I would do this before I got signed
Said I would give all these lost kids and doubters
A reason and purpose to question their lives
Look where I am and then look where I've been
Tell me that I ain't destined to win
Never give power to none of you cowards
To tell me what you think my destiny is

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Gone for a minute but back on my grind
Promise you you are no match for my mind
Took all my doubt, whipped it into submission
And forced my ambition to step into line
I know that they do not want me to shine
I know that they do not want me to climb
I know inside that being a boss means making these bitches get back on their jobs
Can anyone fuck with me now? No
How do these bitches respond? Don't
Looking behind to seeing me now
What do they think I'm beyond? Dope
I've just be taking my time, slow
Being alone in my mind, flow
Putting the contents of all that's inside me into this shit I'm designed for
Crossover, pivot, I'm back in the game
NASCAR on bitches, I'm tracking my lane
Focused on bridging the gap
And showing the youth all the ways to accomplish their dreams
Know how it feels when they kicking you down
And it's getting you down
You gotta make the decision to be the one difference in your life and turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
I know it's hard to be adamant, too
When you stand out like a sore thumb in the crowd
No niggas and bitches and quitters allowed
Ball inside you until the survival of your dreams
Until you are living them out

[Outro]
Everything that you need to know about me is in the music
My home is the music, it's where I originate
It's where I fall apart, it's where I come to lifeAngel got a dream, ha
Murder everything, ha
Yeah, yeah

All our lives we only wanted to prosper
Nothing compares to them knowing they can’t stop us
Throw your hands up, know anything is possible
This right here be the motherfucking gospel

God damn, I’m still the greatest
Well, I didn’t sit back for ages
Feel I didn’t let time be wasted
And I swear I’m still underrated
Gave purpose to these haters
Told them bitches to follow me
Wasn’t making it easy
Had to force my way in like sodomy
Bitch, now I’m at the top like apostrophe
Made you eat your words, hypocrisy
If Angel ain’t the best hypothesis
Make an equal out of rope, isosceles
Y’all niggas then made this a mockery
Had to let my demons out to leave
Go kill, kill, kill, kill
It’s the motherfucking policy
Now my motherfucking brain is a graveyard
Y’all bitches gonna need a savior
I’m gonna scare the people that made ya
Tell ‘em bitches better keep their day jobs
And it’s my job to kill you hoes
I guess that leaves me to play god
Said it’s my job to kill you hoes
I guess that leaves me to…

All I ever really wanted was the sane heart
And a brain that’s only people saying “dope”
In a world where everybody stay true
Got a bunch of motherfuckers that stay hard
I ain’t fuckin’ with niggas
They all intimidated
You ain’t getting no pussy
Just keep on masturbating
You niggas fuckin’ with Satan
Fuck playin’ with fire
I’m King Hazel up in this bitch
You must now address me as “sire”
Bitches check my attire
All of the finest fabrics
The fuckin’ Angel of Death
If they want it, then they can have it
I’m sorry I’m going manic
Insanity is a habit
Got knowledge of proper English
Profanity just to grab ‘em
Busy getting my weight up
Told them I couldn’t carry ‘em
Murder and pronounce them dead
But my pallbearer up for burial
So fuck whatever you heard
I murder whoever said this shit
My builder make that paper
‘cause poppin’ pussy’s irrelevant
Some of you are intelligent
Most of you niggas can catch a line
If you listen closely
You’ll understand that the time is mine, bitch
Angel got a dream, bitch
Murder everything, bitch

All my life I only wanted to prosper
Nothing compares to them knowing they can’t stop her
Throw your hands up, know anything is possible
This right here be the motherfucking gospel

This just beginning
This is fun
This is 30 Gold, bitch[Hook: Sia]
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Oh-Oh
It's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Oh-Oh

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
It seems like yesterday that I was nothing
Then all of a sudden I'm a volcanic eruption
Then all of a sudden it's like spontaneous combustion
And I'm all up in your face, yelling
"Bitch, you can't tell me nothing"
Cos I came from the bottom
Now everybody's watching
I said it was my time
Now I'm who everybody's clocking
And I'm just out here sprinting
I'm running right through my vision
I'm trying to outrun my past
But still trying to defeat my limits
Cause you only get one moment
In this life to be great
And you give it your all, despite what it takes
And you never let 'em kill you
You take take everything they give you
And throw it right fucking at 'em
And tell 'em it doesn't build you
And no it don't ever break you
And no it can't overtake you
Life's like a bed of roses
You take the thorns and you make do
Sometimes you have to hurt
For the cause to be reached
But one day you'll be stronger
Than all that you beat, and you can say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
I woke up one Sunday morning, stopped believing in Jesus
Stopped believing in churches, I stopped believing in preachers
I realized I was a teacher, not just one of the heathens
I'm going to destroy the fallacies, start creating believers
Start creating the leaders, tell them who should they follow
Nobody but themselves, especially if they hollow
Especially when they empty, and death reserved for fulfillment
You the only person alive that holds the key to your healing
So you take it and you run with it
And keep going even when your sun's hidden
Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain come
Is where we often find the light soon as the pain's done
There ain't no material things in the world
That can change the fact you feel alone
Despite the fact that it gets hard, you take it all and you still go
Take the sun and you still grow, lose your light and you still glow
I been there, I'm still here, and I know how you feel, so

[Hook]

[Bridge: Sia]
We don't wanna fight
So sing with me a battle cry
Sing with me a battle cry
Oh-oh
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Oh-oh

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
It's hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it
A minute in my position filled with my opposition
To anybody not different fighting to stay the same
I got lives in my hands and I'm fighting to make 'em change
Couldn't accept responsibility, find somebody to blame
The emotions that I'm harboring 'bout to drive me insane
Tried to say "Fuck everything," but I ain't have the heart to
Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to
So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing
Inspire life into anybody that's forfeiting
Cause it's easy to keep pretending that there's nothing wrong
But it's harder to keep their head up and be fucking strong
So, now they telling me "Go, Haze, they can't stop you
Heavyweight flow, if they can't lift you then they can't drop you
The pinnacle, if they can't reach you, then they can't top you
Man, they can't do anything, that you're about to"

[Hook]

[Bridge][Intro: RZA]
Ay yo, it's the BET Cypher
The Man with the Iron Fists edition
Film out November 2nd yo
But right now check out these new hot weapons right here
Driicky Graham, A$AP Rocky, Angel Haze, Childish Gambino and Joey Bada$$
C'mon, splash em son

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
I came here with one intention to kill this
I'm talking head in my hands, mouth on that drill ish
I be on that wired insane, ultimate trill shit
And there is not a soul that can see me
Like I'm not real trick
Listen up niggas I'm tired of you lames
I'm hungry and you looking like entire food chains
And uh, it's to the point that I ain't even got to try hard
Spittin' like a lake in hell, but bitches like my God
Plus niggas flicking lenses on me like a tripod
'Cuz they know there's only one eye, like cyclops
You know I beat 'em to the count, to the points love
I swear I never even lost in a coin toss
So bow down mothafuckas, if you talking deep shit I’ll out drown mothafuckas
Somebody find my rocker cause I'm literally off it
I'm in the murder business I just spit you bitches a coffin

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Yo, til the day I die, I be puffing lye
Fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move, cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you can see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you'll unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul
Probably you know I found mines right through the pencil
Started bodying flows, but fuck that
This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to Squeal
This one for my people, heading to the top, no re-do
Thinking up evil but see no evil just be Knievel
You can't be this good they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me better
See, God made three Bigs, 2 Pacs but he only made one era, The Era

[Verse 3: Driicky Graham]
Swear you guys slipping like some ice on a bridge
Since diapers and bibs
The light skin has been quite nicer than how Mike was to kids
Cypher rhyming, Rikers Island, spending nights with the pen
Either that or cyber-Skyping with a dyke and her friend
She telling me, she gon' take my cock to her lips
Suffice to my wish, saliva and recycle my kids, gulp
I'm the best, its hard to lose hope
I'm spitting rappers out like orange juice pulp
And looking in the mirror like aren't you dope
You so clean motherfucker you should hardly use soap
Something sinister, raps that minister
You mortals don't want combat, I'll block and finish ya
I'm seriously dope, I'm crack, I'm venomous
And you are seriously poked in your crack by ministers
Eww, these days rappers on my TV
Are braggers about their swagger rocking karats off of Ebay
But I ain't tripping, I like groupie women
Who be sendin' chills up your spine when you see they booty switching
Fast cars with the kufi missing, that's top off
Pop off, I'm with my dawgs like Stewie Griffin
Niggas hear me, be like ooh he be ripping
And if your girl see me she catch that Driicky spank me, do me feeling
Over the money I be pooky twitching
And honestly about the beef I gives a fuck what who be Twittin'

[Verse 4: Childish Gambino]
Still good with a pen, no Joe Paterno
I count Ninja Turtles, my cash flow concern them
Gambino you meet him, repping east side of the A hard
Got the Black AMEX, I gotta pull the race card
Niggas move that Kreayshawn, naw I don't carry mine
Why the game fucked up like my hairline
Ay girl, you ever smoke a bowl out with Kid Cudi?
You ever gotten D like you don't study?
Rap game in the fast lane, with a gas tank
Filled with half of these trash lames
I have to say I'm such a Joey's last name
Bino boy, why you spit so mean
Why the flow so rich girl, them sweet sixteens
He on BET and he got White people problems
"Like, Whole Foods doesn't have the juice I like so I have to go to, you know
Trader Joe's and have it shipped to me"
Victory, history
More G than a kid's movie, Royalty

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
My name is Rock in the new drop, my destiny's to be the new Pac
That nigga Rocky gotta die, he too hot
It’s dead on, must've been tripping and stepping in heron'
Cause I’m cripping the lead on
I’m getting forensics twisting your head on
Traffic, mad clips, caskets, pass this, ashes to ashes
That shit, backwards, tactics
Bitches only like me for my status
Living ghetto fabulous and I’m still acting ratchet
Twenty-four karats, no dressing with my salads
Nigga with the Patch kids, steady talking cabbage
Got a chick red like radish, have it
Bitches think they bad til I drop them like habits
No one in this cyph' has swag like I do
Church with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel
Ever since a baby, ask my old lady
My first four words was, fuck you, pay me[Intro]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood

[Verse 1]
Now imagine that there’s a shorty
Maybe fatherless or optionless
Grinding from checks deposited
Trying to get on public housing list
Mother meets a man with an ample amount of funds
But in order to get that she’s gotta give ‘em some
So he treats her like a beats her like a
Cleans her up and keeps her like a
Screams and yells then seats her like a
Like a bitch, well
You wonder how she got the whole idea
Her ear to the wall and she could hear him pretty clear yellin'
Oh you make me mad bitch shut up or get slapped bitch
Roll over you stand bitch who’s the fucking man bitch
See what I’m saying is the bed you make you layin' in
But what you put out well it kinda remains the same huh
Now you might not be believing what you hear
But the objects they tend to mirror be closer than they appear so
To sit and stay she learned it from her mother
But imagine how it all affected her little brother

[Hook]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood
I’m killing these bitches
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood

[Verse 2]
Now imagine her little brother's maybe 9 or 10
We have have no idea exactly what’s relaying on his end
Until one day he’s out and probably playing with his friends
And to beat and treat a woman like a bitch is what he pretends
We thought that his sister would be the pawn in all his drama
But mixed with misconceptions and his hatred for his mama
He grows up to hate the weakness in a woman
Thinks that if he beats her it will potentially make her stronger
Ah the plot thickens
Little boy bystander gets infected with a sickness
See he grew up wishing his father would come and fix it
And wish mama away and show abuse is what a fist meant! Power!
But the abuser put his fist in all the little boys dreams
Till he sifted and mixed his shit in
To be what he hated wasn’t the aim
But his hatred really made him exactly what he became

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ok bitch was just a weapon I’m using it to suggest that
The primary example is usually the parents, see
Mama didn’t stand up ’cause mama couldn’t lift her chin up
With all the shame she carried she figured they won’t forgive her, see
Mama didn’t notice that the baby wasn’t old enough
She coulda really shown em that there’s nowhere left to go but up
All mama had to do is look and listen but
Mama as afraid as both of her little children
So she let ‘em hear it, let ‘em see it
Let ‘em grow up, let ‘em be it
When all she had to do was just show up and help ‘em beat it
Now as they grew up in the world
The little boy’s lost and has him a little girl
And his life changes -- again
He don’t ever wanna see her hurt by men
To protect her through everything on earth he can
And that moment he understands
Woman should never be hurt by words or hands
And just like that that little boy becomes a man

[Hook]

[Outro]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunder -
I can't do that part, fuck it
I gotta hear that fat nigga do it
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
Nope
I'm killing these bitches
Yeah fuck the singing partI be on that shit, bi-bi-bitches on my dick
Said bi-bi-bitches on my dick, bi-bi-bitches on my dick (swagg!)
I be on that shit bi-bi-bitches on my dick
Bi-bi-bitches on my dick, said bi-bi-bitches on my dick (swagg!)
Bitches on my dick cause I swagg to the maximum
Bitches ain't on yours cause it's short like an acronym
Bitches on my dick because I look like Poca-hontas
And I'm a young Based Goddess
Bitches on my dick cause I'm severely intellectual
Bitches on my dick because I'm also way bisexual
Bitches on my dick because I found that I don't give a fuck
I tell 'em fuck the world, fuck the world until it's titty buck
Bitches on my dick because I'm Alpha like Omega
Bitches on my dick cause I got game, like Sega
Bitches on my dick cause I go "Rah! " like tigah
Bitches on my dick cause I'm a model like I'm Tyra
Bitches on my dick cause I go harder than the rest of you
Bitches on my dick because I ball like some testicles
Bitches on my dick because I'm Based like down low
But still high enough to put God on the ground though
Bitches on my dick cause I be goin' like I can't stop
Bitches on my dick cause I don't cuff like a tank top
Bitches on my dick because I'm hot as summer's first night
Bitches on my dick because I'm colder than reversed ice
Bitches on my dick cause I got hoes like Santa
Bitches on my dick because they wanna like Fanta
Bitches on my dick because my money triple three times
Bitches on my dick because they pussy like felines
Bitches on my dick because they heard I'm so important
Bitches on my dick because I cut 'em then avoid them
Bitches on my dick because I'm always wearing something new
Bitches on my dick because they want somethin' to fuckin' do
Bitches on my dick because I do what the fuck I want
And I turn them ugly duckling bitches into fuckin' swans
Bitches on my dick because nobody can fuck with me
Pretty bitch, faggot, ho I live the life of luxury

Swagg! Swagg![Intro: Natalia Kills]
You should write a song where the concept is…
You’re basically writing like a love letter, or like a piece of advice
To your mother, when she was your age

[Bridge: Angel Haze]
I don’t know
Maybe I would write you a happy ending
I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning
I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you
And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you
Or maybe I’m naïve…
Maybe I’m just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed
It would somehow grow inside you

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
Spent so much of my time wishing you were different
But reality is that with life can't never be provision
But if I could wish for one thing, I’d go back and I’d fix it
I’d tackle all your obstacles and kill 'em with precision
And better the intentions of every single person
Who'd play a part in you learning exactly what your worth is
I’d shower you with purpose, I’d wipe hate off the surface
I’d reshape all your pain and make it fucking worth it
No more feeling worthless, no more fucking searching
No more of that fraud shit, nobody else could hurt you
Yeah, said nobody else could hurt you
And if they ever tried too I’d wipe 'em from the Earth too
Cuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too
I know that you been running from everything that’s behind you
I know you’ve been burying everything deep inside you
I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you
But I’m stuck sitting in this time frame
Struggling with my demons and playing these stupid mind game
One day it could get better, maybe it could get better
Maybe we could change shit, no more inclement weather
Know you hated your mom, know it went through your mind
You were just like me, wish that you had more time
To see life from a different angle, wrestle with a different angel
Wouldn’t lose your wings and fall from heaven like a cliffhanger

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
Everything is different now, nothing is the same
And nowadays I swear it feels like you don’t know my name
But I look at the mirror and I see you every day
I’m you in every way, every hue and every shade
And maybe you should know, it’s the last thing that I wanted
Cuz what I hate about you makes me feel like I’m haunted
And I don’t wanna spend the rest of my time on the run and-
So I’m just gonna confront it, yeah I’m just gonna confront it
And tell you that I love you for everything you made me
And that you need to hear this even if it makes you angry
God lives inside you, you’ve already found him
The Devil lives in memories and you just let him hound you
And I despise your church for every fucking thing they taught you
It’s just a fucking stain that I wish I could wipe off you
That I wish I could wipe off you
And I forgive you for doing everything that it cost you
Everything that it cost you
Fame is such a heavy price, I wish it didn’t cost you
Losing a part of me that would follow you to Hell
Follow you to hatred, or follow you to jail
Followed you to patterns that I could never get out of
Now I realize that I could never make it with that love
Now I realize that shit is the alternative outcome
Never wanted you to save me, I just wish I count some
I just wish that you grew up with someone you could count on
I wish you knew that you could never make it without love
For your goddamn self, and that you never ever find it in anybody else
Cuz I would help you find you
And if I saw it killing you I swear I would revive you
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy end in peace

[Bridge 2: Natalia Kills]
Because, you are such a special thing
You’re not just my mom, but you’re the reason I exist
And the best life that you could’ve had for yourself without making a mistake
Would have meant I woulda had a nicer childhood
And even though my childhood wasn’t perfect and I still love you
I just want you to know that if I could go back and do one thing for you
Or be one person for you
I would make sure, not just for my sake, but so that you could’ve had a nicer life
And a nicer childhood, that you know
You would not have made the mistakes that put us all in this bad situation
And not have the strength to leave
But just so that you would have been happier and stronger
Even if I didn’t exist, even it meant that I was never born
That’s what I would have wanted for you

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
Yeah, and if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
Cuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too
I know you’ve been running from everything that’s behind you
I know that you’ve been burying everything deep inside you
I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending

[Outro: Angel Haze]
I don’t know
Maybe I would write you a happy ending
I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning
I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you
And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you
Or maybe I’m naïve…
Maybe I’m just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed
It would somehow grow inside you
And that I could hide you from the rain
So that it could be easier for happiness to find you
Or maybe I’m still a kid who’s caught in a dream
I’m the heir to the throne of a princess who’s still trying to be queen
Or maybe we’re all just caught in the winds of a massacre
The blackened leaves of dying, black dahlias(Verse)
Back in the booth and I'm bout to attack
Nothing but Jesus was holding me back
All of you bitches been lyin on tracks
And I'm modest but right now its time after that
Who are these bitches? They wastin my time
Doing nothing constructive, they wasting the grind
I'm exposing you frauds because i feel its time
Then I'm peelin' your skin back and chewing the rhind
Everyone know ain't no stoppin my shine
Punchlines that feel like a blow to the spine
Came from the dirt, from the bottom i climbed
And i climbed up that bitch till im outta my mind
Call myself Angel 'cus that be the goal
Stay draped in black cause it matches my soul
Swear i be rhamses way I'm wrapped in gold
Versace, Versace, you already know
I haven't opened my mouth in some months
I just sat back and kept watchin you front
I just sat back and kept letting you stuck
But that silence was silently callin your bluff

(Hook)
Why you still going? You still boring
Zz Zz Zz I'm still snoring
This morning I woke up with a foreign
Thing that can only be seen when I'm touring
Baby I swear I'm the best bitch who doin it
Fuck all the critics, they blind and too stupid
All of this vision of mine is so lucid
All of this passion I got is so ruthless
That all of you bitches are now rendered useless
Yeah you're now rendered useless

(Verse)
Cry for competition
Or just different people who make better music
And that's just in general
Said that's just in general
I'mma fuckin straight shooter
This shit ain't no beef and I don't do subliminals
(GOD)

(Hook)
Why you still going? You still boring
Zz Zz Zz I'm still snoring
This morning I woke up with a foreign
Thing that can only be seen when I'm touring
Baby I swear I'm the best but you doin it
Fuck all the critics, they blind and too stupid
All of this vision of mine is so lucid
All of this passion I got is so ruthless
That all of you bitches are now rendered useless
Yeah you're now rendered useless
Dirty Gold  bitch[Poetry Intro: Angel Haze]
"And the light, the light can make everything feel beautiful. It can make it feel safe, so safe that, like, in the night, we spend all of our time running away from our truths. And then we meet someone who tells us, 'God will always love you, no matter what you do. The only thing that will never stop loving you is God.' And because of all of our darkness—which at night I still run from, which at night we all still run from, we get stuck chasing light. That's a Black Synagogue."

[Gospel Intro: Angel Haze]
"And God said that the meek shall inhabit the Earth! But there shall be masses, I said masses!, of bloodshed first! And that will open the floodgates of Heaven, and pour down upon us His blessings from the floor, to the ceiling, but only if you praise Him, I said praise Him, shall you receive His healing!"

[Hook x2: Angel Haze & Wynter Gordon]
Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
I been running from the pain in my brain
Got stains on my scene while I search for the real me
Search for the real me, lost in the night
Only talk to angels when I'm lost in a height
I don't really wanna get lost in my mind
So I pray until I feel I'm getting lost in the vibe
Then I took the bottle up and I drink it to my what?
Yep, drink it to my fucking soul's lost in my eyes
But I don't really wanna drown no, 'cuz I'm not that trusting
But I'ma keep coming 'round though, till I'm sure that I found something
And when I tell you what it is, you better talk to God, remember
No feelings, no thoughts allowed
And if pain's a trapdoor then I need God
And so send someone to come walk me out
But don't think, don't talk about it
Wait, don't sing, don't tell nobody
Wait, don't drink, don't fail your body
Wait, don't scream, no, fucking shout it
See, these voices in my head are the fucking loudest
So belligerent, so fucking rowdy
And my tunnel vision's so fucking clouded
And I don't really have a motherfucking outlet
So, I talk to God, but I don't really know if He can hear me
But you know Him well, and I think that you could bring Him near me
So I keep praying, every word that I keep saying
Every part of me that I needed shield from
Every part of me that needs saving

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
None of this's real, when it calls you
Thought I found you, now I'm lost too
I've been listening to service sermons
A lotta redefining, a lot of words reworded
A lotta thoughts detected and thoughts suggested
A lotta stuff that resonates with certain persons
I've been searching for the truth but it's embedded in lies
Read every single verse until I'm red in my eyes
And God'll only hear you when you offering ties
And protection is the truth
But when the Devil's a lie
But what am I to do when the Devil is I?
And everything I touch seems to shrivel and die?
My mama always said I was a rebel inside
But now I'm looking for some peace and a benevolent I
And how it feels to need that, some humbling pie
And how long it will take when it comes from the sky
Means I'll probably be waiting until I crumble and die
And just wrestling with Satan while I'm struggling by
So, I think, I talk about it
Wait, I drink, I tell somebody
Wait, I sink, I fail my body
Wait, I scream, I'm fucking shouting
Cause these voices in my head are the fucking loudest
So belligerent, so fucking rowdy
And my tunnel vision's so fucking clouded
And I don't really have a motherfucking outlet
So, I talk to God, but I don't really know if He can hear me
And you know him well, and I think that you could bring him near me
So I keep praying, everything that I keep saying
Every part of me that I needed shield from
Every part of me that needs saving

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
Did he die on the cross for this?
Do you have any fucking proof?
Everything here is man-made
And I'm just searching for some fucking truth
Cause everything they ever told me not to do
Has always made me question what freedom is
Why listen to the words when they not from you?
And why feel judged when I freely live?
Now I know what the fucking root of evil is
And why peace is dead, but evil lives
Everybody thinking they can talk to you
And what they believe in they hearts are true
Now they feel that they had the right to persecute
Judge, doom to hell and come first to you
Now I don't really know who wrote the Bible
But nothing under the sun goes unrecycled
Take every shot you have with a fucking rifle
Cause you rarely ever get a chance for revival
So, just think, just talk about it
Wait, just think, just tell somebody
Wait, don't blink, don't fail your body
Wait, just scream, just fucking shout it
So the voices in your head fall abruptly silent
And the blood in your veins flows rough and violent
And you see everything with your lifted eyelids
And every burden you carry is eventually lighted
And you talk to God, even when you ain't sure he hears you
And you give it to Him, tell Him, He can keep the pain and fears too
And you keep praying, only now you don't repeat sayings
Cuz you know when you let it go, then you receive savin

[Outro: Angel Haze]

"How many people here look for Jesus to solve their problems? Lots of people. And how many of those people are fixed? None of them know fucking about shit, they're all fucking fucked up. Anything to help you escape. It takes it, it takes something to just say, 'Fuck it! This is reality, I'm gonna deal with it!' But do we ever really deal with it? Deal with it, stop running, stop trying to find these substitutes? Stop trying to find Jesus in strangers, and Jesus in church, and God, and find God in yourself. Powerful thing, yeah?"[Intro]
(Ai-ai-ai, ai-ai-ai)
Woo!

[Verse 1]
Drift off, meet after dark
Leave what you love with a head full of art
Run to the sun to wherever you are
Swear to your moon with a cross on my heart
Swallow my thoughts, let's get lost in the sparks
Of whatever this is
I'm devoted to you, babe, affection is risk
But do you have my heart? That's a definite yes
Starlight, the beauty, the visage is bliss
Nature, you're gloomy, perception is lit
I can see you and me, struggling beautifully
Paint the whole scene with good head and good, uh
(Just can we dance forever?)
(C-c-can we dance forever?)

[Verse 2]
I think I'm obsessed with you
If the world was ending soon
I don't think that I could take it
Yo, what's the point in messing around
If we both know what we've found
Forever, baby, we could make it
You say

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's human nature, we all are dying
But I'm still burning bright and blue
If we're in danger, if time is flying
If so, we'll both be lifeless soon

[Chorus] (x2)
Let the candles burn slow
Forever young, I wanna be
In this moment
Oh, we're just making too much love
Till heaven calls, it's just me and you only

[Post-Chorus] (x2)
Let them candles burn slow
Oh, them candles burning
Oh, them candles burning

[Verse 3]
I took you where the leaves are bright
Fall is your favorite season, right?
I don't think I heard you clearly
Yo, I can barely sleep at night
Funny, you the reason why
I don't think you need to fear me
We should

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We should keep dancing, we should keep trying
We should keep burning bright and blue
Oh, we're in danger cause time is flying
And soon we'll both be lifeless too

[Chorus x2] + [Post-Chorus x2]

[Bridge]
You told me you ain't wanna do it
Said love was for stupid people and cupid
I swore to you that I could make you lose it
And now I got you dancing to my music
Got you dancing to my music
Got you dancing to my music
Shake it, make it, move it
Got you dancing to my music
Got you dancing to my music
Got you dancing to my music
Shake it, make it, move it
Got you dancing to my music

[Chorus x2] + [Post-Chorus x2][Intro: Jarren Benton]
What up Dizzy?

Jarren, Benton. [scratching noises]

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, fuck these niggas, I don't trust these niggas
Pull the knife out the AK, and cut these niggas
Put the knife back on the AK, I throw the AK away, I get the nunchuck and nunck these niggas
I am, out of my mind, Jarren, you gon' really sniff all of those lines?
Where the fuck were you when I was out on my grind?
Stress bout to blow my brains out of my spine
Insane in the membrane, sick with the pen game, y'all niggas been lame
Frickin' faggot, gagged and fucked in the ass like the Gimp did Ving Rhames
Eastside tyrant, little bit of vibe when I flee from the sirens
I hit a nigga in the leg with a tire iron, and crack him in the fucking skull with a fire hydrant
I'm a beast, I'm a god, I'm a killer, I'm a pimp, and I walk with a limp
You're a geek, you're a lame, you're a bitch, you're a fag, bitch you talk with a lisp
Like "Hey Dizz, pull your dick out, all we wanna do is party"
Meanwhile, I'm with your fucking baby mom at the drive-thru at Hardy's
She say "Yeah, I thought you were ballin'", bitch you see the Hardy's at Arby's
Bougie ass trick still let a nigga hit, so I fucked her in the back of an RV
What up to my nigga named Dizzy, hoes throw the pussy at a nigga like a frisbee
Hatin' ass niggas gon' hate, better load up the guns, till the pussy ass niggas come kill me, feel me
Chop ya, body up, put it in my locker, freeze it, cook it, put it in my pasta
The chopper go 'brah' in your mouth like binaca, drop ya, call the fucking coroners and doctors
Duct tape and rape ya, As-Salāmu `Alaykum, killers from Jamaica, they gon' let you meet your maker
Funk Volume bitch, we don't need a fucking major, Mr Benton sickest motherfucker from Decatur

[Hook]
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
Okay, they let me loose and I'm at it
Bitch I’m noose neckin' this rap shit
Got a gang of hoes on my matress
You a bitch nigga, you manson
Man I'm too much for you niggas
I could murder you on yo own song
Give my flow some turbo
End up breakin niggas like O-zone
Kill a nigga quicker than a mili to his temple
Drag his fuckin' body beneath the 2 cylinder
You too weak, and me I’m too villainous
Ain't shit safe bitch I ain't through killin' it
Bitch I'm hard as I do claim, bitch I'm harder than you claim
I get on anybody’s song and make that shit part of my food chain
Boom, bang, bang, boom, bitch back, back better gimme some room
I got a wild mind, I'm on a million shrooms
Codeine cups look like a million prunes
I'm ill, and I want it, those two deadly components
Anything I'm in, I always win
Can’t even picture havin' opponents
Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
They done fucked up, fetch the bong
Remix bitch I'm extra on
I’m rollin weed, overseas
Funk Volume bitch we finna set the tone
Can’t trust 'em, fuck it, put em' in a bucket
Wanna see my dick so you could hug it?
Came a long way for niggas to fuck with me the long way
Independent on the motherfucking budget
Man I’m never putting this mic down, right now it's my lifestyle
Change your lives on a high cloud, I got marijuana all in my white owl
So the hoes wanna hit it, niggas get to witness the bitches that really groupie for a livin'
I’m at the show, she at the front, now she at the hotel trying to get the motherfuckin' business
Hold up, hold up, why everybody on my dick?
Is it cause I rip songs, hit bongs, with hit songs and niggas wonder how I'm getting on like this
Damn, find another lover
Can't trust 'em cause we tired of each other
Brother, Las Vegas will never have another
Tell XXL want the motherfuckin' cover[Intro]
For you, alright, look

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
A story to tell
Pennies into a, wishing well
See it's hard to cope with a kiss That you can't tell
And a word that you can't spell
And a victim, who can't yell
And they under your fucking nose with a sickness you can't smell
And the problem is that you really crying for help
Nobody out there can hear you it's like they silent your yell
It started when he was 7
Continued to when he was 12
And in the middle of the night
Found another man than himself
But this man was confused
This man was abused
See this man was a tool To the sickness that he let loose
Infected and he abused
Molested and he abused
Till the person that he affected was lesser than finna shoes
Damn, he affected the chance to choose
He never gave him an option
He told him what to believe
But never gave him a doctrine
Now little boy blue, he's just like you
Sick in the head can't die but he'd like too
Damn, same dreams every night too
Screams every night too
Thinks that he's like you
Says every single day there's new demons inside you
They scream and they fight you
They scream to remind you
Of all the fucking pains still breathing inside you
And they give a million reason to die too
But nobody ever sees what's inside you
I know it cause they ignore my screams and my cries too
I met a girl once ,went through the same thing
She told me shit happens, but things change
Things change, she told me all this pain don't mean chains
You gotta take it and remake it 'Til it means strength
But I ain't strong enough, I don't think I'm strong enough
Why me man I wasn't even old enough
I wasn't strong enough, wasn't even bold enough
Would've told my mom but that shit would've torn her up
And she was torn enough, and he was mister perfect
And I was trivial I guess I was just fucking worthless
I just want you to know how much it hurt me
Because of you I feel like I'm not a person
So I sit here with this blade in my hand
I got the pain of a child and a brain of a man

[Bridge]
And it's so loud
I wanna fucking scream but I don't know how
I wanna let it go, but I don't how
Yes, it's so loud
I wanna let it go but I don't know how
It's so loud
I wanna let it go but I don't know how
I wanna fucking scream but it won't come out
Tried to escape but there ain't no out
Now I'm stuck here in this castle on a cloud
Castle on a cloud, Never going up
Never getting out,never coming down
Castle on a cloud, Never going up
Never getting out,never coming down
For you

[Outro][Verse 1]
I need to know
That somehow forever is real
And we can grow through whatever we feel
We could be like rose petals, Olympic gold medals
Or pretend we're kids and run through like every field
See, it gets much deeper than we think
Cause sometimes, you don't just fall
It gets much deeper, and you sink
And you're immersed in its love, so nothing else seems to matter
Though there's wholeness in the moment
It's nothing for things to shatter
So, can we break it down to a science
If love is chemistry, then you and I could be its ions
If love is mostly strength, then you and I could be the iron
And we carry the weight 'til it hurts
Do anything to make this shit work
Cause love won't always be easy
I just promise my all when you need it
And you'd be on time when I need you
And we'd vow to always be see through cause
There's no progress without some digression
And love is boring without some aggression

[Hook]
Just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Baby, put your hands up and we can reach forever
Just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Put your fucking hands up

I need to know that it's possible to love you
Like they do it in movies, baby
I need to know that it's possible to feel you
Like you're never ever moving
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Cause I love the way you do me
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Hey, baby, we can make it, make it right

[Verse 2]
I need to know that somehow our destiny matters
And that you'll keep my heart intact if the rest of me shatters
And that the things that we endure, we'll effectively master
Baby, this is food for thought off of destiny's platter
See, it takes some pain to make it work
Although diversion could occur, it takes some rock to make it Earth
I need to know that I'm safe within your grasp
And if ever I'm off, that you would race to keep me on track
Cause I would crack the clouds open just to show you heaven
And lift you up when you get down just to show you leverage
And if you've never felt love, I'll make it tangible
And show you how to do it right, I could be the manual

[Hook]
I just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Baby, put your hands up and we can reach forever
Yeah, supposed to be together
Put your fucking hands up and we can reach forever

I need to know that it's possible to love you
Like they do it in movies, baby
I need to know that it's possible to feel you
Like you're never ever moving
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Cause I love the way you do me
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Hey, baby, we can make it, make it right

[Break]

I need to know that it's possible to love you
Like they do it in movies, baby
I need to know that it's possible to feel you
Like you're never ever moving
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Cause I love the way you do me
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Hey, baby, we can make it, make it rightDon't get too attached to me

[Verse 1]
I get what I want then I decide that I ain't satisfied
Flippin' becomes something else like 6 into the number 9
Promise what I never mean and take you to that other side
Then step out your life, now your world seem like you colour blind
Can't break the cycle, it's a system and I know it well
Get introduced to heaven, and then I give'em hell
I got that potion, I put them under a vicious spell
And then I drop 'em like pennies into a wishing well
Told you I was different, chances are I lied
Said I'd give my all, and never really tried
But this heart is all I have and I cannot let it divide
And if we talking 'bout our feelings
I'm not acknowledging mine
We can build a little, break a little
Give a little, take a little
Talk about love, baby we could probably make a little
Or, we can feel it 'til it dies
But hold onto your heart cause I'm gon' hold onto mine

[Hook]x2
I've been running 'round in the same old circle
Cause when your running and you fall it could hurt you
But I can't give you what your dreaming of
Cause I run from everything I care about

[Verse 2]
I've been played before and it's a process
To get through everything
Then turn around and just acknowledge
The fact that people change
And everyone has different mind sets
And we can go through pain
But we shouldn't let it bind us
And we could hide from love
But chances are it finds us
And we can run for years
And its still in trail behind us, define us
There's a difference when you gifted and thrown into a position
And you hurt but your indifference can never stop you from feeling
And, I remember thinking you could save me
'Til you said that I'm the only one that can change me, crazy
Find a different filter to deal witch'ya opposition
Cause until it really kills
It should never stop you from living

[Hook]x2
