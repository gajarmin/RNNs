[Marion Band$]
Everyday I think lucrative
It always got to be progress
If it ain't about that money then it ain't a part of my process
Meeting with the bosses over lobster tails
Strategizing our next move
Conclusion is prevail
Bitches that hold yo shit up, bitches that fuck yo shit up
She call and she wanna lick up
But I'm busy hittin this liquor
Bitch I'm chasing money
You dont deserve a description
It take some sacrifices
To get in this position
When my well was dry, I was still making my wishes
I was riding around, I was risking it
But if I didn't do it I wouldn't get this shit
Up late nights I'm an owl too
Theres a few things that I value
Money, trust, respect, loyalty and my crew

[Hook]
Politicking with my niggas about this money bitch hold up
I had to drop my bitch, cause I don't need no hold ups
Walk right in VIP, we don't do no hold ups
Get too close, I got some killers with me that'll tell you
Hold up, hold up
(tell ya)
Hold up, hold up
(tell ya)
Hold up, hold up
You say you want this money then nigga what's the hold up?
If you really 'bout this paper, then what's the (Hold up?)

[Nipsey Hu$$le]
Nip Hussle the Great back
Came up, you can't hate that
Self made you can't take that
Yeah, self made you can't make that
Some say I need a record deal, I need a cosign, I need a Dre track
But all the time I had a mean flow, I had a cold grind and that's a great match
(Hold Up)
Payback, fuck hoes and I make racks
And my pockets gon' stay fat
Cause I merk beats and I slay tracks
(Hold Up)
Payback, wrist rocky like A$AP
Stay strapped like I'm Arab
And in a world of lies I still state facts
Lame-ass, hatin' niggas take flame baths
All you really doin' when you running your mouth is telling me where to aim at
(GUNCOCK)
Duck nigga, fuck-bitches and fuck-niggas
If you ain't talkin bread then I don't fuck with you
(GUNSHOT)
HUSSLE

[Hook]

[Marion Band$]
Fifteen, Uh
I'm going all in it no matter the outcome
They told me I had it and now I am relapsing
And how could you "X" me out? I am not Malcolm
And how could you doubt me you heard my first album
And who had the nerve to think I was done with
I left the game graciously for you to run with
Like that of a blueprint, go on and front then
Time that you had, and this what you come with?
Hold up
If you want it to work out, exercise it nigga
And if you want to see it, visualize it
That was me that we been discussing
And it was the thought, they thought I was bluffing
I know that they waiting to see what I come with
I told you my best and I feel my toughness
Hold up
Nevertheless I'm who they fuck with
I'm the go-to guy you niggas go too shy
No Kanyes or Commons
I'm coming
And don't ask me who I like in the game right now, I'll say no comments
YUNG

[Hook][Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a [?], wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: Retch]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', it still got me goin'
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own shit and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Bryan
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm draggin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'?
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trainers cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds, [?] all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine [?] and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
[?] niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was [?]
You nervous like I thought you seen [?]
Got everybody thanking me
[?]
I'm a boss [?]
[?]
[?]
Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
[?]
Riding shotty in the chevy [?] know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk [?] like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado] x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to [?]
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meech]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
To get their shot, [?]
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real west side nigga, [?]
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
[?] put me high [?]
You can do that, flyin', fuck, do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on [?]
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga then drip of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the work she see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
[?] chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx [?] on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make shine sit on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell
Now I been rich since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your diction is lack, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo in another color
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My ? say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian [?]
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: SL Jones]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like [?] we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a [?]
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social [?]
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
And [?] sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
[?] what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em
Never write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the [?]
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
[?] with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on [?] tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
[?] I got it right here, I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
[?] we gettin' it
With that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a [?] to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off [?]
Rottweiler just to watch 'em
Maybachs for the profit
Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing

All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne
And a 3 page spread
Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, go for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
[?] a monk, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be into me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A black claimed king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare try the Elohim of flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up trick
Put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work

East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like [?]
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my [?]
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip
And just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit  with a pistol
[?] full of [?], I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID
Game leave me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some [?]
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
[?] throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blastin' naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Man didn't chief
My sons of sons'll sandwich the beef
We get loot, always scram from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this bitch, smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Neighborhood Nip I came in on this shit
Most of my homies in the pen' for this shit
Westside N's, ain't friends in this shit
Bust at you niggas that pretend with the shit
A lot of niggas tryna blend with the crips
Make him break bread, kick in for the shit
Run him off cuz he been was a bitch
It's a big ass hood but it's a small ass clique
(Look), full of real niggas and we hate fakes
Round table, politicking on the late late
Can't run a nigga credit then he ain't straight
Gang of volunteer killers and they can't wait
I'm from where they cut holes in the gate
Take him to the back, and expose if he's fake
Point Blank, shoot a hole in his face
No weapon, no witness, that's the whole in this case
Look, county jail front line with a shank
S Gang, neighborhood in they face
Homies left got detained to the state
But I kept it that way in a whole different tank
Roll it up, you a whole different game
Rap money, that's a whole different bank
Niggas done so much dirt in LA
Got these niggas banging this in a whole different state
(Look, Look)

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Bloody Jay]
Bloody Jay, I'm bloody drunk, I guess that's why I'm throwing it up

Take a look at me and you know i'm suwoo
Flame tho, Flame tho, Flame tho
Bentley bees
Firing out these pistols relentlessly
And we hitting everything, like Nowitzki threes
You know I'm on a balad, that's blood with it
Red drank, that's blood lean
Strip ya pockets taking shit the fuck down, that's blood team
Team blood, can you keep up?
Catch up, blood Rich Gang
Bitch wait, wait

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Ay, I'm banging blood but I'm booling on Slawson, nigga

Aaahh, I live life like a shark, I'ma jaw that nigga
Ooohh, I'm shooting him on the chest like a blouse, lil nigga
Nigga, don't bother my line trippin bout no bitch, nigga
You better not ever think I'ma let to Simon like Mitch, nigga
Don't ever think I'ma ride your bitch and don't do no tricks, nigga
Ride a Tec, ride a Tec, Tec Tec
Get the pussy nigga tatted up for free, that's free, I ain't charged no tax

[Hook: Young Thug][Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Thumbin' through the bands

Those niggas won’t call you again
Bring the noise to 'em niggas
It’s loud and it’s obvious
The strange shit I do
The things that you see
The bottles I pop, the way that I speak
I’m out in these, I’m shining on D's
No turning down, now you turn me up
The bright lights will burn you up
From LA to the MIA
To the up-top, I've been on my way

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
In candy, candy paint, candy paint
In candy (candy)
I’m in the candy paint
Just a Sauga city young nigga
Just a young nigga don't tell me nuttin'
I'm a young nigga, just a young nigga don't tell me nuttin'

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
She say I make her wanna get dressed more
Never talk about the sex, make her want sex more
I, met her on the 55th floor
Told her it’s a party next door
She used to think about her ex more
Now she shop at Rolex more
Let go her regrets more
I gave her game and motivation now she blessed more
Thumbin' through them bands busting checks more
Found herself now she demanding respect more
Don't ever turn me down that’s what stress for
And we can travel around that’s what jets for
I’m the type to leave a mark on your neck more
Laurent clutch purse in your Lex' door
Realism got you feeling the effects more
Fuck it I might just take you with me on my next tour

[Verse 1] + [Hook][Hook: Snoop Dogg Sample]
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks [x8]

[Verse 1:YG]
Aye..uh
Got this bitch named Tar, She let me fuck her in the car
Like Kim Kardashian, she wanna be a star
Got this bitch named Britanny, With Big ass titties
But bitches ain't shit, cause Bitches act Mickey (ughhhhh)
Got a main bitch, but I don't need her
Every time we fuck, I gotta pop a bean first
Hit the purp, then eat that pussy for dessert
It gets worse, just watch when she squirt
I got this bitch who act Sidity
She live in the 60s
Every time she hear I got a new bitch, She says she miss me
I'm a thug, Got this thug bitch she stay up in the Jungles
Every time we go to Crenshaw Mall, she have a Rumble
Got this bitch in the Hoovers, I don't wanna losaaa
Ass so fat to measure it, I need a rulaaa
Got this Bad Bitch, that go to North-ridge
She always wear Gucci, but she can't afford it

[Hook]
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks [x8]

[Verse 2:Tyga]
Take a bitch life, Now it's my life
Need a bitch that can Fuck, Cook, Clean, right
Turn a bitch out, make her lick twice
Yeah she eat pussy, but she don't fuck dikes
Laid in the middle, two Miller Lites
Straight kill a bitch, pop rocks little sprite
Bam bam little chubby ass goey car
Tell the bitch twinkle twinkle come meet a star
I don't Odom, no Lamar
Kind of money make her come out her Leotard
I'm in this bitch, like my dick hard
And I shuffle money, Like playing cards
Uhssssssssssssssss
YG tell them bitches whats up, they ready to cut no
Links in my suit, we don't cuff em
Straight duck em, Like Donald
Quack Qwuck
I don't even know the sound them bitches make cause...

[Hook]
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks [x8]

[Verse 3:Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I like bitches, that's lightskinned-ed
With a whole a lot of ass, and get right with it
Off a pill, I can probably make her like bitches
Lick Lick it, like a lolli till it's like liquid
These hoochies always talking bout, wher my dick is
But if it's not in your mouth, then get out my business
A nigga real ratchet, I ain't wifing shit
Known to fuck and cut her off, Light switches
Uh, Now What I get? Money bitch
You look good, but to me you just a bummy bitch
And the funny shit is, you know my other bitch

Scandalous bitches, we living in a cold world
That's why I flip em, flip em like ah zone girl
And every week I change my number to my phone cause...

[Hook]
Bitches ain't shit but, hoes and tricks [x9][F][Verse 1: RJ]
Now fuck the silencer, I'm shootin' through the pillows
And if the door's locked, I'm jumpin' through the window
I might be wrong but I ain't tryna work a 9 to 5
So if I gotta sell these pills, I'ma sell 'em high
Go get your business straight on renovated condos
Ratchet bitches whippin' chicken like a Roscoe
Niggas face tatted like Baby, Bomb and Bosco
And my city, niggas judgin' for what you got on
I'm well known from Atlanta past Fig homie
Me, TeeCee [?] 400, Mustard gettin' rich though
No Limit [?] gettin' money like what they hittin' for?
Follow code, gotta value morals and principle
Niggas actin' like they're pimps but they paid the bitch
Some of us ain't in the position that we say we're in
In one year I done moved in 3 different residences
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Mercedes Benz

[Hook: RJ]
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I just want a dime on me
Snitchin' throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I gotta keep the fire on me

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm ridin' dirty on the L-O
Cause the judge givin' niggas body parts, elbows
So I paid 15 hundred for my stash spot
This janky dude, if you fuck with it, it'll pop out
Ooh I got a strike and a felony
But the homie ridin' with me say his record clean
So you would take this case is what you tellin' me
Oooh, you better not tell on me
You went to jail for a nickel, came home too quick
And you wonder why your homeboys never wanna tell you shit
But you wasn't too sure so the homies still let him lurk
'Til niggas saw that paperwork
Told the DA, he was just drivin', he plotted, he did it
He even threatened to fuck me up if I wasn't with it
Now it's all bad in the hood and he can't come around
Conversation's like, "somethin', somethin', somethin', gun that nigga down"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I made it through my situation and I stayed down
For niggas [?] it's nothing much you can say now
I'm so accustomed to sucka' niggas that hate now
I pokerface and then touch 'em, my niggas play foul
It ain't no rules cause these niggas threw the rules away
If I could pick a place and time I would choose today
See I'm the type of nigga die for his jewelry
Gang related homicide is what the news'll say
Playing with my reputation ain't amusing me
Playing with a nigga patience who are you to say
Short temper, fuck it, I'ma blow a fuse today
And when I lose my mind I'ma shoot a face
I seen 'em get away with murder cause he knew the way
Killed a nigga, went to trial, then he beat the case
So what type of example do it set, nigga
Play with mine, you can fuckin' get wet nigga
Yes, nigga

[Hook][Intro: Jules Winnfield]
And you will know I am the lord, when I lay my vengeance upon you. I been saying that shit for years, and if you heard it that meant yo ass. I never gave much thought to what it meant I just thought it was some cold blooded shit to say to a muthafucka before I popped a cap in his ass. I saw some shit this morning made me think twice. See now I'm thinking, maybe it means you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here is the shepard protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness

[Hook: Young Thug]
Nipsey, smoke that lil bitch
Take the cuban link off and choke that lil bitch
I'mma gon' expose that lil bitch
If you didn't know it nigga, now you know that lil bitch, hey!
You's a cocka roach ass lil bitch
I'mma take your head off and roll it, no rollin' bitch, hey!
Big B's on report card, right beside me is a whole lotta C's lord

[Hook 2: Nipsey Hussle + Rich Homie Quan]
Black loccs, Neck gold
Rich bangers, Death row
Keep hammers, pockets bulge
Yea, Yea
Lil nigga, step off
Fake bangers, Just pose
Us niggas, snatch souls
Now you know, now you know (x8)

[Verse 1: Young Thug + Nipsey Hu$$le]
Hold it, I'll eat you like a Krystal
All my jewelry showin' loud like a whistle
Hold it, know some bodies on my pistol
Woah, don't push me cause I'm a killer
Thug, gon' and smoke that lil bitch
Take the ruby robe off and choke that lil bitch
You shoulda known, no approaching this clique
Got the Damu riders and the Locs in this bitch
Don't spit out my baby, all my whips the latest
I know I'm the greatest, sorry but I'm taken
And my living room floor plan spacious
Niggas better stop playin', get to busting at they faces
I'll turn your goons into pieces and sell 'em overseas and
I ain't gonna tease her, sit on it like a bleacher
Send 'em to my Haitians in Miami, they gon' eat 'em
Or I might send 'em to my Crips, let them defeat 'em
Shout out my niggas banging at the Four Seasons
That good drank got a skinny nigga eatin'
I gotta live, I could name 100 reasons, that I'm squeezin'

[Hook: Young Thug +  Rich Homie Quan ]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Thought I was playin', I had to show that lil bitch
I fucked her three times but I ain't know that lil bitch
Went platinum a couple times now it's gold on my wrist
Probation tryna drug test me, I can’t hold my piss
They claim that I owe the money, I don't know that nigga
We throwin' up gang signs, no Zodiac nigga
Been locked up like three times, I can't go back nigga
Got these bitches watching me like a Kodak picture but
What am I to do when it feel like the walls are closing in, on me?
Time is ticking, got the Frank on my wrist, I ain't talking about Ski
I know these niggas talk about me
Be the same nigga who be walking 'round me
I tell a broke nigga "talk is cheap"
Thugga Thugga wit' me, can't forget about

[Hook: Young Thug +  Rich Homie Quan ]10 toes in these chuck t's
When it come down to it
Still getting more money, more bitches
More love than a nigga screaming fuck me
It's so beautiful, it's disgusting
When you figure it out, niggas wasn't all in
So them niggas is out
Shit hit the fan see what niggas about
I heard misery loves company
It's no lie, you get lonely at the top
It's a chance you can drop, so, they don't try
And I won't judge you, I know why
So don't shoot me down when I fly
On the road to the riches
It's a whole grip of niggas that will wreck they cars it won't rise, fuck it
Call some hoes up and roll this weed up
And turn the lights down and pour this drink up
My last shit sold out I'm bout to re'up
Tat on my neck, face, chest and sleeve
Where the cars are world I like foreign features
I get 10 for shows and 10 for features
I've been in the hood and on them beaches
I've been in the game and on them bleachers
Now I see my lane and the shit I speak on
Where I'm standing, motivate my people
In the ocean, blue range with nico
If I'm drinking champagne, it's probably clicquot
Bossa Nova, we should probably eat bro
Got a couple of zones but we gon probably need more
We gon probably need more
But first, let's eat bro
Order me a steak and rice another early morning, another late night
Doing 7 days a week, can you ever get to sleep?
That's 25/8 life oh, get money
Take flights, go for full throttle, no brake lights
Make all the bad bitches wanna play nice
And all the broke nigga wanna hate life
Yo bad[Hook: Nipsey Hu$$le]:
I came to get money and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it
You asking why you won't, it got too much mileage, ooh
You're looking at a 1 of 1, ooh
I'll show you how this shit is done, ooh
My chain look like it weigh a ton, ooh
Bitch, look at what I've become

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]:
I make a grip, walk inside this shit and then take my pick
I take a shit, on all you fake niggas when I drop my shit, I run my shit
I own my shit, I'm on my shit
I'm on some shit, some owner shit, some mo' shit
I pay my rent, I pay my team
They make me rich, I make them rich, ain't that some shit
Now, watch this look
More cash, more money, more fame
I'm the realest nigga in this fucking game
I came up, off the corner, all grind
Make these cracker niggas respect my mind
I run my shit, I own my shit
I'm on my shit, I'm on some shit, some owner shit
Range rover shit
I came to slice bread off the loaf and shit
Get you niggas off that feet up on the sofa shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]:
I talk that shit that's cause I live it, nigga
And if I don't know more that's cause I did it, nigga
You get smart you get richer, nigga
You start hating and I'll chip you, nigga
To be specific, it's a, west side, neighborhood
Crenshaw District, Slauson Ave Cripping
Anybody killing, don't give a fuck about a bitch or a nigga, yeah
They quote my raps like scriptures, say I shop like hipsters
I drive cars like a rich nigga
And probably pull up with your, ho
Oh, six two o's, fasho, get dough
Pulling up at my show, been about a bank roll
Make these mills and lay low
Bust a whip and change clothes, money, power, and hoes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: BH]:
100 pints thats 100 grand (thats 100 racks)
Bring your money if you want it then (if you want it nigga)

My pack loud like like a fucking band
Big choppers like the Taliban,
All these racks, i'm breaking rubberbands (count up)
I love my haters they my biggest fans (i love you niggas)
Im on the field and they just in the stands
I let em watch me while I make these plays
6 touchdowns in they face, that's something to hate on
On the block yeah get this money
OG rolled in my swisher
After this, pour up in my sprite
That little bitch know she bad, she got ass and I wanna fuck
But

[Hook][Intro]
It's that 4 in the morning shit

[Verse 1]
I'm off this Red Bull
I got a head full
A nigga stressed out, let's get this bed full
Sexual healing; so appealing
You a bad bitch, I'm a real nigga
Tell me that you love me
I tell you the same
That's a fucking shame
We both runnin' game
I just want your pleasure
You just want my pain
I just want you all for me and you just want the same
Let's take a flight; let's live this life
Let's get a hotel, let's both spend a night
I'm a busy nigga, you a busy girl
It's a fast life we liven' in this busy world
We in my fast car, you ain't no fast broad
You got yo' heart broke, he did yo' ass wrong
Plus yo' dad gone, let me be yo' daddy
I wanna see you happy we both come from broken families
You can tell the truth, I'mma tell it too
We gon' smoke this weed 'til they kick us out the room
Like fuck it, that's life
Fuckin' tonight; we fuckin' right?
You fuckin' right
I ain't goon' lie to you; I know I'm fly to you
Nah, fuck that girl I'm the sky to you
Ocean in the clouds; birds and the bees
Your friends proud when they know that you fuckin' with me
I got you poppin', I'll take you shoppin'
Around the world; started on Slauson
That's real shit; real shit
I know all my real bitches feel this
4 in the morning, tell me that you want it
Bend you over, I got you moaning
You love this shit, you want this shit
You got this shit, no politics

[Outro]
Smoke something with you?
It's like we pouring' some more drink
Get yours, I got mine
This that real shit
Sittin' on the top floor of the fly ass hotel drunk as fuck with a bad bitch
Make you appreciate life
Nigga work hard you know
7 days a week we do this shit
You should do it with me
When I'm gone, shit play this
I ain't trippin' on shit, ain't no rules in this
Fuck 'em all though
Hussle50 young niggas sellin' crack for a livin'
Tryin' to buy a Benz and a flat television
Single income and he tired of the feelin'
"Momma, I'm a man," gotta show her that he meant it

It's a cold ass world, gotta show 'em that he get it
Watch a good lil boy turn into a cold nigga
He ready to die just to show 'em that he wit' it
So he put it on his mind, gotta get it how you live it

One Shot got life, Zimmerman got acquitted
Talkin' 'bout a carjackin', we talkin' 'bout a killin'
Wonder why we never have faith in the system
Look at young niggas like a waste of existence

And when we do make it, look at how they try to twist it
Become the world champ, and then y'all enlist us
Get rich off of rap, y'all search us for pistols
It's like it ain't no respect 'til we burn up the buildings

Could you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?

50 young niggas sellin' crack for a livin'
Tryin' to buy a Benz or a flat television
Single income and he tired of the feelin'
"Momma, I'm a man," gotta show her that he meant it

It's a cold ass world, gotta show 'em that he get it
Watch a good lil boy turn into a cold nigga
He ready to die just to show 'em that he wit' it
So he put it on his mind, gotta get it how you live it

No Punches
[Verse 1]
Bounce back off every loss like a real nigga
Handle business like a man, I’ll make a deal with you
Loyalty for loyalty, I keep it real with you
You go to war, then I’m gonna kill with you
Married to the streets, ask me why I’m still with her
Ask a don this obvious, I’m a field nigga
Around the corner it’s a dozen niggas still tripping
They’ll still kill you if you still slipping
Look, I put curtains on my rear wind shield
My bitch bad but my wrist on chill
My bitch bad, man, that bitch got skills
She 5’11 rocking 6 inch heels
She my Excedrin in this sick ass world
She probably make a stray bitch toes curl
She used to being rich nigga, retail
But money’s my only fetish with my rich ass self
Hussle, I know y’all hating but I wish y’all well
I’m eating steak, cracking crip leg shells
I’m getting cake, let the champagne spill
It’s either participate, or your bitch ass fail, nigga

[Hook: June Summers]
I’m looking at the world through rose colored glasses
I could chase this dream but no I had to catch it
I been 10 toes down, I’m out chea, looking back that’s how I got here
‘Cause even when I slept in the gutter, I was still at the start

[Verse 2]
Young niggas fucking bitches, getting dope money
745, gold chain, rope money
Was every man for himself when you was broke bumy
You make it happen, niggas acting like you owe something
My nigga, I just wanna let you know something
The clock ticking, you gotta get it and devote something
The transition and legitimize the flow of it
It’s just a given that these folks coming
Look, I knew some niggas that was killers and these hoes loved them
Was getting money till some other killers told on them
The whole city, and they business they was known for
A string of bank robberies, was beasting for a whole summer
It ain’t no hall of fame, it’s over and they don’t love you
Ain’t no arenas hanging jerseys with your old numbers
You gotta get what you can get and make the most of it
You beat the odds then you grow from it, look

[Hook]


[Verse 3]
Let’s get it straight, these niggas fake
It's Nothing though, we getting cake
My mornings early, my nights is late
It's all dollar signs in on my license plate
Y’all niggas struggling, my life is great
You freestyling your life, I write my fate
I play to win ‘cause life’s a game
Put your all in this music and your life will change
It’s what I told myself, that’s what I showed myself
It’s a cold and lonely road, you gotta go for self
I meditated ‘cause I knew I had to know myself
Said 600 Benz, is what I owe myself
Worldwide recognition, now my flow is known
In and out the States, pay me just to show my face
Bottle after bottle, empty out the case
Hip hop, empty out the safe

[Hook][Talking]
Yea...
Me and my nigga Rimpau
Was on the way to the studio...
And cuz had that ummm that Wiz and Curren$y mixtape in the tape deck
The Cd changer... and I heard this beat I'm like "What the fuck!"
Yahp!
Ya know, only thought it's right for my 58,000th leak
Shit hear we go

[Verse]
7 days a week, 7 different freaks
But I got tired of fucking hoes so I just smoke and count my cheese
Watching Godfather, leather couches, flat screens
I say I’m on this marathon, she ask me “what does that mean?”
Ain't no puff and pass please, roll your own I do the same
Girl, get on that Marlon Brando and stop tryin’ to pick my brain
Yo boyfriend is a lame thats why you’re not used to this game
And if you looking for me, I’ll be first class on a plane
Ixnay my landing gear cause I don’t need no runway
My final destination is some clouds and a oneway
Fucking with them streets, ain't no stranger to this gun play
But I now I eat these beats and I don’t ever take a lunch break
Back to back swisha sweets, never grown no sober shit
Post traumatic stress, I feel like thats what Im coping with
So I smoke the best, impossible not to notice this
30 thousand feet up, I cross the atlantic ocean with a pack of Swisha’s rolled
And if my time ain't even over yet
I’m tryin’ to live my life so when it’s over I got no regrets

Keys to success, multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity, believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it till it’s over with
Napa Valley Dolce, my cup runneth over with
My trunk is in my roof eh, you know who you rollin’ with
Hussle!

I know a place we can go
Where you can be yourself
You ain't gotta worry
And we ain't gotta rush, cause we not in no hurry
You can’t be afraid to let go
You gotta let go of yourself
But you ain't gotta worry, cause this gon take some time
But we not in no hurry[Intro: T.I.]
Search far and wide
And I bet you'll never find a lil' nigga with a heart this size
Keep me separate and apart from all these frauds
They see me get appalled, you know why?

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Every time I take, penitentiary chance all I take
God with me I'ma find my way
Nigga they ain't even fuck around nowaday
Feds came in the house, say they found my yay
A couple handguns and a new SK
Bag full of weed and some Grand Marnier
But fuck it though, I gotta keep my grandma straight
Catch a case, getaway by the grace of God
Standing on the corner slanging slabs of hard
Just a young soldier no camouflage
Man them niggas ain't tough they're just playing hard
I pull a fuck nigga card on GP
Between 'em make 11 mill and peewee
We spray your block, turn around pull up, repeat
And let everybody look at it on TV
Man I'm certified and I'm gangster
Getting on the rock like my banker
I'm in the gated mansion, no neighbor
New Italian suits on my hangers
I got Cuban links and diamond rings
Solitaires and shiny things
Aye fuck how tough you tryin' to seem
Come try the king, cause I'm about my

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Have you ever heard the point blank blast of a Mossberg?
Whole block never mind like you've not heard
Lil' nigga keep it moving like they not scared
And out here, it's do or die, kill after kill in the coupe so fly
Man the niggas over there tried to shoot your guy
Man the fully automatic .22 go by like damn
And as fly as I am, it's hard for you to tell how high I am
Oh my God damn, you see it don't believe it still
And all I ever had was a Glock 23 and an extra mag
Presidential weed and a extra bag
2 or 3 bad bitches on the jet to France
We set to land and I get to the plan
How to violate your little sexy ass
Then get in the Jag, the little Vette crash
Just ride this till you get to splash
You a wild girl, go cowgirl
Keep the noise down, you loud girl
Turn down, don't know how girl
No white girl cause

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Couldn't listen to niggas they said I dream too much
Heart fucked up, guess I seen too much
Numb to it now, bring a gun to it now
When this shit pop I'ma run to it now
Niggas talk loud but they dumb to announce
Read he got away so he tryna play it down
When they kick down your door and they run through your house
Cuffs on your wrists and they cussin' you out
It'll make sense then, telling you that they got your prints then
What's the reward for your risk then?
Niggas game goofy, this just in
Time after time, know we need a light nigga, blind lead the blind
Why do we ride? Grind to provide nigga, not just to shine
Blood in my eyes, stress on my mind, let a fly nigga fly
9 on my side, God I'm your child but times are so wild
Playing with me? I'ma draw down and I'ma show out
If it gotta go down, I'm prepared to go now cause

[Hook][Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you girl, you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And nigga I'mma die for my fucking respect

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
You fucking with a young nigga, two twelves in the trunk nigga
Havin everything he want nigga
Life on the rush nigga, probably never get enough nigga
All he wanna do is stunt nigga
Niggas always looking up to him, whole spot going up to him
New money getting stuck to him
Life it was rough to him
Skinny nigga he was buff to it, trying to do it like Puff do it
Do it like Russ do it, real life said wassup to it
Need a Benz nigga fuck Buick
Made a plan and I stuck to it
I'm the man you a bluff to us, small talk such a sus to us
The money is a must to us
We came from these corners but we at it til we affluenced
You gotta bring your guts to it
Trying to get it to the point they gotta bring it in a truck to us

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
All 'em blogs never shook a nigga
Hundred racks just to book a nigga
Greatest ever like a Brooklyn nigga
All this ice here is hard to overlook a nigga
Fell in love with that fast money
50 racks on that back end
Walk through cause four bricks
Maybach's when I back in
LAX Nip roll that pound
Pool outside of that polo lounge
MOB bitch hold that down
Pinky ring gold Rolex crown
Testify; never go that route
Black bottles, that Moet out
My first mil I had a Kodak smile
Tell the plug bring more back now
Fake jewels never tolerate it
Pray boobee's case exhonerated
Every night I thank God I made it
Every night I thank God I made it!
My bitch bad like Paula Patton
Big ass mansion from all that rappin
Tell the police call the captain
Motherfucker I'mma start the clappin

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle][Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic (Nope!)
New king of this beat shit, I'm the hardest
Just being honest
You don't got a Grammy nigga, don't comment
This is my HS87 promise, I go crazy killer retarded
When I touch the beat and get started, Barry Bonds it
And I hit these hoes with the peace sign
Nigga, As-alaykum salaam it
Boy, you better get your work up
Been the same niggas since surf club
They putting on for that best side
I'mma make sure that they heard us

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
I know what it is
These niggas ain't real, tell the truth 'bout how I feel
Fuck these niggas, what's the deal?
I know what it is
Y'all forgot I ride around on the weekend
Top down for no reason, y'all was missing that G-shit
Y'all was missing that G-shit, y'all was missing that G-shit
Y'all was missing that G-shit, y'all was missing that G-shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
I'm out here on my Pac shit
She out here on her Faith Evans
Niggas still on that fraud shit
Selling out all of my concerts
Breaking bread with my dawgs, shit
Repeat the steps till we all rich
(Repeat the steps till we all rich)
I'm getting that change
Sitting on deuces, riding on [?]
One part of my brain was like
"Hussle, get to it, just sign on your name"


[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
Look, I don't waste time, I take mine
From the state line to Boston
New York to Austin[Intro: Rick Ross]
Walk with a real nigga
Self-made millionaire
What more could you ask for, huh?

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]

All blue chucks, with the gold spikes
All black benz with the chrome pipes
Run my own shit, own my own rights
Press my own line got my own stripes
$1,000 luggage on a long flight
See me out in public, bet my arm bright
Million dollar meetings, cause my songs tight
Said he gonna take it, nigga all right
Fake it till you make it, me I ball right
Stack it till my paper is Lebron height
Russian cut diamond cost your car twice
S550 thats the wrong type
600 Benz, with the fog lights
Press the gas, snap your neck like a short bite
Most of these niggas live the fraud life
So most of these bitches is a frauds wife
When you meet a real nigga, play your cards right
Cause when I meet a real bitch I do that broad right
Bet you I'mma leave a mark, like a dog bite
Sellin hot 16's like they off white

[Hook: French Montana]
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds
And I ain't going back -- I'mma ball first

[Verse 2: YG]
Put you in the dirt, with all words
My team straight, all pervs
These hoes dirty nigga, all germs
Listen to Nip, you learn like he spittin all verbs
Bad lil bitch, all curves
Homies like corners, they all turn
Man that big body, nigga all swerves
Bitch before you come to my house, call first
Nigga, do your homework
Gotta take care of home first
You a ho nigga, take a ho bath
I got the strap on me, real niggas hold that
Where the rachets at? Lets get ratchet though
Never trick on them bitches, ain't a magic show
I never trust and I never lust
If it ain't the first night then we never fuck

[Hook: French Montana] x2

Smokin Backwoods
Marathon OG

Hussle
Yeah, I feel brand new like I just started this shit
Like at the beginning
I Know y'all been waiting
My foundation's solid, let's take flight

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
Turn off the lights, turn up my mic
Roll up some flight, let's all get right
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I got that good, still in the hood
I kept my word, yea my nigga I make good
6 figure niggas in them v-12s
No tint nigga so you see well
My Cuban link that's 14k
My presidential, I wear it every day
It symbolizes, how I'm enterprising
I came from lint in Dickie pockets so I emphasize it
You check the filing, niggas say I kept it solid
But fuck the rumors, money talks and you made less deposits
I dropped some videos, you should go check the comments
They love me all around the world my nigga, what's you problem?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
All my liquor from France, my cars from Frankfurt
Told them keep they advance
Distribute and market my label
I own it all, I own it all
Word in them offices is that I want it all
That's right I do, now who the fuck is you?
To question my request, I paid my fucking dues
Had a couple dreams now they coming true
I'm at the Porsche lot, asking do they come in coupes?
Walking out the club with a hundred goons
Magnum bottles of the Veuve, an a pungent fume
Model bitches stunting in them fucking shoes
Bring your homegirl, cause she coming too
Fast cars with them leather seats
Drop top she a fucking freak
Blow me down while we ride on PCH
I'm Nip Hussle the great
Middle fingers in your face

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J Stone]
I'm Infant Stone, I just came home
My flow is sick, disinfect the microphone
In 08 we told you we was never gon'
Change, and we still on this marathon
I'm a heavy hitter like Barry Bonds
Lightweight setback for a heavy arm
Now I'm jumping on stage with my jewelry froze
Fresh out, spending money, killed the movie role
It's all money in like a Brinks truck
And it's no money out like a prenup
You need to get your green up
Cause me and my team up
Light up some flihgt, lace up my Nikes
Victory lap, tonight is the night
This the shit I waited for my whole fucking life
This the shit I waited for my whole fucking life (Stone)

Like that

The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No más pistolas y rosas, no
No más [?] con fácil copas, no
Aprendí si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el águila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook][Sample: Aalyiah]
A million, a million, million...(x2)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I got my mind on a million 'fore I turn 26
But that's just what it costs for that condo at the Ritz
I got this European belt, belt, European bitch
Ever seen an African in a European whip?
I got my top off in traffic playin' this, get'em pissed
Police hot, cause my operations legit, suck my dick
All my life they've been shootin', thank god they miss. I'm convinced
That I'm here for a reason, it don't make sense, how they miss
All my niggas is gone, but I still exist, I exist
So I got on my knees and I told him this, I repent

[Hook: Nipsey & Aaliyah]
One in a million, a million, million

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I got my first hundred thousand 'fore I turned 22
And then I went to jail for some shit I did not do
Them niggas think it's rap, huh, till bullets make'em back up
Know I'm in the movies bro, but I am not no actor
Way before these contracts, I knew I was all that
Bet she say Nip Hu$$le if you ask her where the bomb at
She don't even smoke weed, she's just high off contact
Way before I launched that I understood the concept
Got it from my bro, bro, never drove a six-four
Used to push that cut dog, but now I drive that Benzo
I don't got no girlfriend, cause baby I'm against those
We say that we just friends, but really know that is one in a

[Sample: Aalyiah]
A million, a million, million, millio... One in a million...[Intro]
If what I believe
Is proved to be wrong
Then I guess i'm a miracle

[Hook: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I was been supposed to change up
I was been supposed to fold all this pressure
I was been supposed to change up
Nigga what would I look like I come from the hood
I represent the only way up
Had to hustle boy I'm tryna touch the toy
I'm trying fuck these LA streets up
Think it's safe to say I did it
Look nigga, uh

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
All black everything, and my diamonds all love like Vera Wang
Look, blue rags in the south of France
Theres some things in life that won't ever change
Me, I'm a nigga that's supposed to ball
Cause I'm a street survivor and they mould us wrong
Before rap we was rolling stones
I drove a cutlass coupe, a couple corners on
Front of the building on my mobile phone
I'm thinking pace yourself cause you can overdose
Not on the drugs but the life you chose
But hanging niggas they don't like parole
No such thing as they might parole
They putting cameras up in microphones
They got me sandwiched in I want a nicer home
They know I take the risk I don't know right from wrong
Plus any given day you might be gone
No cliche where the lines get drawn
Come on the block its a riot zone
For the loot niggas stoop into pirate mode
Paint with less strokes and divide you dawg
Guns get drawn niggas lives get lost
Never was entitled had to fight for raw
Necessities in life, you see the reason right?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
All black everything in my 600 Benz with a heavy chain
Look, you deserve a real nigga with money
Theres some things in life that won't ever change
Me, fell in love with a cutie
A celebrity herself prolly fuck with her music
She the one that the shoe fit but I can't stop for love
Look how the game has seduced us
Benihana  or the Ruth's Chris
Alot of new responsibilities with all of this influence
Spending racks therapeutic
So I snow flake the fakes like ACs in my new shit
One button, where the roof went?
TMZ taking shots say cheese for the news clips
Dope boys and them boosters
Gangbangers and hoopers
My style is inclusive, the streets is abusive
But its life my nigga wanna survive gotta shoot shit
Hella thick skin never bruise quick
Yellow wrists and some 7-speed shit
I talk to you on some sucka d shit
All visual nigga going digital nigga
Not the smartest nigga but its visceral nigga
My understanding on a level kinda different my nigga
Every time I drop the city a feel it
Every time you hate you gotta be kidding
Every time I pull up the foreign is kitted
And I can't even really walk through the Beverly Center
Hudson jeans on ain't the regular demin
I bought the 600 not the regular Benz
Famous without a deal that ain't regular nigga
Tired of telling you niggas I'm not a regular nigga, no!

[Hook][Hook: June Summers]
I'm a army all by myself
A soldier if nothing else
An army (I ball) and I want it all (I want it all)
Them O.G.s that brought us up
Them young boys that's coming out
The wars speak won't stop with the call (won't stop with the call)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Look, I'm from the hood, won't never turn my back on it
Got balls tryin' to make it with this rap homie
And the boy get his hustle on
Keep my 45, I don't need no muscle homes
Got the heart of a hundred soldiers
Got my town on my back, and it feels like a hundred boulders
Now that's pressure, the boy never fold with it
Serve you a dish, look nigga I'm cold with it
In the bricks with my 'G'-double 'O'-'N's
Mack 10 loaded im my 5-double 'O'-benz
Ridin' on my enemies, got no time for friends
All about business, got my eyes on ends
Homies said they're your homies, some niggas pretend
Forget about your ass, when you hit that penn
Jay Rock and Nipsey, yeah we out to win
Red and blue make green, bitch niggas hating

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Look, our city never quite shook off
The recipes of Ricky Ross
Couple of niggas rolled, but most just took a loss
While the real bosses passed bills in city hall
Legislate the law for the niggas that cookin' raw
The razor blades and rocks get cut on fine china
My blocks economics like the beers [?]
The black man's sacrificial land for the concept
A land based on the false prospect of progress
For instance
[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Look, my niggas crooked though it seems
My every single thoughts caught up in collectin' cream, a made nigga
Picture me dyin' in the blaze of gunfire
Will not retire till I'm paid till I reach the pie
When we ride we fly by bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 1-2-5 and do or die
Rollin' with niggas from Long Beach to Long I
I'm heartless now cause my heart froze
Once I commence my show I rip apart foes
Now I got one nation just a crooked compilation
Just the inner bullshit let's get back to money makin'
Tell them bustas that I rolled on controllin' a house
My shit's so wicked when I flip niggas closin' they mouthh
Them cocoa brothers, Buckshout the beady eyed thug
Greg Nice, LS, Asu, sure show a nigga love Outlaw![Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
(Look) Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Black eyed the game and got passed on
Me, I kept this shit super solid
Came up, and nigga you acknowledge
See me in my coupe, I got stupid dollars
I'm a dropout but now I speak at colleges
Ironic, I'm honest
I get paid to speak my mind, and it's crazy to me
Just pay me fooly, if I wrote a script it'd be a crazy movie
About my life, about rolling dice, about taking risks
You gotta know the price, gotta know yourself, on the coldest nights
Can't turn it down, you gotta own the fight
Win, lose, or draw, you could ball
You could've kept it real, but nigga, you'sa fraud
Before you get the shit, you gotta lose it all
And then you find yourself and see that you'sa God
And that's real shit, thousand hundred dollar bill shit
Front hood to the hills shit, like how the fuck did we build this
Real shit, look
Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Came in the game then I passed up
I can't stop, won't stop
I'm the type to get more guap
You the type to fasho flop
I'm from Brynhurst and them dope spots

[Hook: Vernando]
[?]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
(Aye, check it out, look)
I'm still runnin' laps, takin' fades, I still run it back
Talkin' guns, I got a hundred straps
And I be in your bush if you fuck wit' fats, that's a fact
I don't fuck wit' rats
This boss life, I got a lust for that
Pullin' up at Sak's, blow a hundred sacks in my V12
I don't fuckin' slack, not at all
I gotta ball, they shot my dog
Rest in peace, my nigga, Frog
Life is short, nigga, then it's gone
But in the mean time we tryna get it all
You should get involved, I'm really raw
Before this rap shit, I really balled
Alpina's, nigga, on white Lincoln's, nigga
Black beamers, nigga, they can't see us, nigga (naw)
Sometimes I get so offended by it
Don't compare me to none of these fuckin' liars
I'm fuckin' flyer, I'm fuckin' realer
Play wit' me, I'll be a fuckin' killer
Seven takes wit' no fuckin' filler
Now victory laps my fuckin' thriller
If you broke, I ain't fuckin' wit' you
Unless you went broke while you was fuckin' wit' me
Then you bounce back cause it's nothing really
We gone do it big 'til they fuckin' kill me



[Hook: Vernando][Hook: K. Camp]
Nigga, I’ma live like it’s my last
You worried bout them bitches we done had
Baby I’m so focused on this cash
I said baby I’m so focused on this cash
I said she wanna roll cause she see me in that ride
I ain’t got no time, gotta put her on the side
You can’t come between it, between it
You can’t come between it
Baby I’m so focused on this cash

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
VS bezel my Ro', perfected my role
Focused my mind, and got to this dough
I'm one of a kind, not like what you know
True to my oath, they proud of my growth
I come from the turf, I doubled my worth
I made some mistakes, but that’s just part of my search
They connect with my words, right at the part where it hurts
This life is a bitch, my hand up her skirt
Had a thirst to get rich, couple stains on my shirt
Every reason to fail, but we was makin' it work
We was walkin' on water, you could say it was church
All this money I’m makin',  every day I’ma splurge
Boy!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
We on that Clicquot and kush, all yo buttons, I push
We pull up in that Benz, all them pictures they took
Paparazzi gone flock, that's cause both of us hot
Ain’t no limit like Percy, but we like Jada and Pac
Let’s invest in these stocks, let’s vacate on these yachts
Let’s go chill out in Bali, let's make a tape and let’s watch
Let’s by two of those watches, let’s go do it on Collins
Let’s fly out to Atlanta, you play that role, got you poppin'
I fuck wit yo style, you should be somebody stylist
Every time we have sex, you makin' noises the loudest
Faces you makin', paper I’m chasin'
If I make you my girl, you ask if I could be faithful
I’m stuck to these streets, I'm sprung on this loot
Addicted to crime, but I’m attracted to you
Pull up in that Porsche, then hop in that coupe
Pull off in that Benz, it's me and that’s you (uh)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Girl yo sex the best, hickies on yo neck
Love the way you dress, plus that pussy wet
Do it 'til you sweat, and yo hair a mess
Have you late for work, but you been carin' less
You been livin' more, you been lettin' go
You been having fun, just to let me know
That you down to ride, you down to roll
You know the game, and how it go

[Hook][Nipsey Hussle]
I dont want your love
It’s not why I make music
I owe myself, I told myself back then that I would do this
And I always look so out of reach
It just seems so confusing
That I felt my place in life
A young black man its seems so useless
That I don’t want no help
Just let me suffer through this
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas
This knife thats in my back
It’d be the the truth that introduced us
And the distance inbetween us
Its the proof of my conclusion
So life is what you make it
I hope you make a movement
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunist
Hoping as you walk across the sand you see my shoeprint
And you follow, til it change your life, it’s all an evolution
And I hope you find your passion, cause I found mine in this music
But I hope it’s not material cause that’s all an illusion
And they all in colusion
This racist institution double standard
Acting like they not the reason we ruthless

[June Summers - Hook]
Tonight is my night
This is my moment
Feeling bigger than life
But I gotta own it
Its a victory
Lets make history

[Nipsey Hussle - Verse 2]
Look at where I started and look at where I’m standing
Y’all can say its luck
But I know that its planning
Shout out to the pain
That gave me understanding
Shout out to my gang
It turned me to a savage
So niggas could say what they want to
But I go through what they haven’t
But it’s not ego driven, it’s not me boasting and bragging
This road I chose to go down
Hard to slow down when in traffic
In order for me to grow I had to let go of some habits
And its easy to say I’m on now cause you see it, and it happens
But before it ever did I had to believe and get it cracking
So I’m gon take you back then, 32 shots and my mack 10
With a dream minus the means my early teens was fucking tragic
And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you can’t imagine
That I wrestle with the night demons that I fight I can’t get past it
So no matter how straight your cash get
It don’t matter if you plastic
I was looking for the lights and all we stumbled across was flashes
But tonight…

[Hook]

[June Summers - Bridge]
Bigger than average life
I’m brighter than Vegas lights
Feeling like I can’t lose
Any other day I do
Its feels like I’m 8 feet tall
Tonight is my night
For sure, for sure

[Nipsey Hussle]
So if it’s meant, than it’s gon be
People love it, cause they know it’s the real me
The cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me
But I don’t want the fame, I just want y’all to feel me
It’s my time, so I’m going in
We ball till we fall, fuck how the story ends
We see these niggas hatin’
I know you hoes plotting
I ain't worried bout it
Cause I know God got me
Say I know God got me
Yeah I know God got me
Yeah I know God got me
See I ain't worried bout it
Cause I know God got me
Once in a lifetime shit you know
Song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthaf-cking dream
F-CK what they say, do your shit

[Hook]
Tonight is my night
This is my moment
Feeling bigger than life
But I gotta own it
Its a victory
Lets make history

[Nipsey Hussle]
The marathon N*gga , This shit ain't gone stop until I say its gone' stop
It ain't gone' stop until you say its gone' stop
And it ain't gone be unless you make it
It's yo time get up off yo ass, Ten toes down out here you know?
I swear to God I shed tears in this Mutha' F*cka' booth
To my N*ggas that's gone And can't be here with me
For the ones that is
Shout out my beautiful baby girl Imani
Shout out my big bro Black Sam
Shout my n*gga facts
Shout out my bro Alex[DJ Skee Intro]

[Hook]
My bills are paid
And everything's okay
It's like every day here
Summertime in L.A

[Verse 1: Game]
I'm from Compton, home of the fiends
Home of the monsters, home of triple beams
Home of the shattered fucking dreams
Where most niggas I grew up with ain't make it to see they teens
Ain't no Freddy, ain't no Jason, but niggas too scared to dream
And they ripping pages out of them books bout Dr. King
You don't wanna know half the shit I seen
Where reading a magazine get you hit with a magazine
Niggas ain't scared to murder cause the jails too packed
Kill a nigga, he be out before the "R.I.P." tat
I seen Raider snapbacks by Starter
Then I seen Dre make that Sox hat harder
Then I seen Makavelli go at Shawn Carter
Then I seen that block where B.I.G. got slaughtered
Then I knew it was my calling
G the fuck up or die balling
Lace them red Chucks up, but die falling

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
I'm rising in this game and it feels great
Still trying to keep it real, niggas still fake
I'm so impatient, but I still wait
Dropped The Marathon in November, niggas still late
Still show love when I feel hate
On a scale of one to ten, need a high heel eight
Or better, blowing this cheddar like I'm Bill Gates
Whatever, I'm in to win til this movie ends
Smoking California, eating Peruvian
Out on Miami Beach, my niggas, a few of them
Just like Beverly Hills, the bitches we usually wear
From wishing on a star, nigga, took it far
And if I lost it all to war, I wouldn't trip at all
It sound crazy when I say it
But the fear of falling off is the only thing that could take it
I'm straight

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
I got my hoodie on, it's a Starter
I'mma rock this motherfucker for Trayvon Martin
I'mma rock this motherfucker for Trayvon's daughter
That he coulda had; where's his killer at? The whole hood is mad
That ain't the first time, won't be the last
See reflections of my past while I guzzle through this glass
Make me want to run up on you with the muzzle -- "Where the cash?"
Retaliation is none, niggas can't afford the gas
Got a mansion in the Hills, Rottweilers by the gates
Red Ghost's in the driveway and ducks by the lake
Spending time with my daughter so them ducks gotta wait
Let a nigga call it a duck, he gonna eat a .38
I'm supposed to be this fucking rich
I'm supposed to be this fucking great
I'm a menace to society, no Larenz Tate
But me and my niggas straight and

[Hook][Hook: Snoop Dogg Sample]
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks [x8]

[Verse 1:YG]
Aye..uh
Got this bitch named Tar, She let me fuck her in the car
Like Kim Kardashian, she wanna be a star
Got this bitch named Britanny, With Big ass titties
But bitches ain't shit, cause Bitches act Mickey (ughhhhh)
Got a main bitch, but I don't need her
Every time we fuck, I gotta pop a bean first
Hit the purp, then eat that pussy for dessert
It gets worse, just watch when she squirt
I got this bitch who act Sidity
She live in the 60s
Every time she hear I got a new bitch, She says she miss me
I'm a thug, Got this thug bitch she stay up in the Jungles
Every time we go to Crenshaw Mall, she have a Rumble
Got this bitch in the Hoovers, I don't wanna losaaa
Ass so fat to measure it, I need a rulaaa
Got this Bad Bitch, that go to North-ridge
She always wear Gucci, but she can't afford it

[Hook]
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks [x8]

[Verse 2:Tyga]
Take a bitch life, Now it's my life
Need a bitch that can Fuck, Cook, Clean, right
Turn a bitch out, make her lick twice
Yeah she eat pussy, but she don't fuck dikes
Laid in the middle, two Miller Lites
Straight kill a bitch, pop rocks little sprite
Bam bam little chubby ass goey car
Tell the bitch twinkle twinkle come meet a star
I don't Odom, no Lamar
Kind of money make her come out her Leotard
I'm in this bitch, like my dick hard
And I shuffle money, Like playing cards
Uhssssssssssssssss
YG tell them bitches whats up, they ready to cut no
Links in my suit, we don't cuff em
Straight duck em, Like Donald
Quack Qwuck
I don't even know the sound them bitches make cause...

[Hook]
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks [x8]

[Verse 3:Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I like bitches, that's lightskinned-ed
With a whole a lot of ass, and get right with it
Off a pill, I can probably make her like bitches
Lick Lick it, like a lolli till it's like liquid
These hoochies always talking bout, wher my dick is
But if it's not in your mouth, then get out my business
A nigga real ratchet, I ain't wifing shit
Known to fuck and cut her off, Light switches
Uh, Now What I get? Money bitch
You look good, but to me you just a bummy bitch
And the funny shit is, you know my other bitch
Met me through her, on some under cover lover shit
Got damn, ain't that your homegirl?
Scandalous bitches, we living in a cold world
That's why I flip em, flip em like ah zone girl
And every week I change my number to my phone cause...

[Hook]
Bitches ain't shit but, hoes and tricks [x9][F]
