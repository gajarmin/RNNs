[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip Hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars driving slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned, styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is coming look around your town is crumbling
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leaving MCs listless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher, partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9ne's vilde!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house through the front window
And heard this guy shout, "Hey that's my couch"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm ripping this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flipping vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breaking so many freaking needles, I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doing drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting from high noon till the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was, when I cut ya neck
Leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon and spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinning like lead from out the  Heck and K
Tearing your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate
Until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to but what you gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you but what you gon' do
Rev can give it to you but what you gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fucking up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul file sexual harassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fucking murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show repping with Sway and Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One coming with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willing to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willing to bet, on a Sway and a Tec, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gaining respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just seckle
Ha-ha-ha, fresh for 1999 you suckers[Verse 1]
On fo' seven, the helicopter lights nearly blind me
In the south east streets is were you might find me
True bandana, my scanner, and my pager
In the blue 1994 one blazer
And I'm the one all the ho's wanna get wit
Jack Daniel punch and the indo spliff
You don't like the way I kick shit
You can get the dick six fo' three wheelin
Mobbin to the picnic
But somethin's missin, wake up and stop dreamin
Tyshe let's take a ride to the coast to get a demon
Bring it back to Gomper's Park before two
And everybody know what the fuck we gon' do

[Chorus]
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit (we gon smoke a sherm stick)
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit, we gon smoke a dip (sherm stick)

[Verse 2]
In the men's bathroom, fool let me have room
So I light it right, so it won't go boom
I took fo' hard hits, and passed it to the next man
Now it seems like I got powers like the X-men
Sittin on the curb, for four fuckin hours dog
Thinkin bout my homie in the pen, lil boss hog
Damn near dead, bout to head to the tilt
My homegirl woke me up, wit a carton of milk
I'm glad I didn't get caught slippin when I was sleepin
On them fools on the otherside who call themselve's creepin
But see sucka, gangs a nation crew
And everybody knows what the fuck we gon do

[Chorus]

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
(Sherm stick)

[Verse 3]
I flips the ill gangsta shit on the worst day
Bitches sayin go bullet lock it's ya birthday
My homie b.k., threw a party and we got there late
You know I had to make them ho's wait
And when I arrived, the whole shit was in a trance
Niggas gettin bong out, muthafucka a dance
Haha, gettin ready for the next batch
My homie's asshole naked, doin the muthafuckin cabbage patch
Niggas throwin up, it's a part of growin up
My piss test is straight, it ain't shit showin up
So duck, cause the next busta might be you
Now all y'all niggas know what my crew bout to do

[Chorus]

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip

Yeah, this for y'all niggas out there, and y'all bitches out there
Smokin that border, rest in peace big tray dogg, much love loc[Ice Cube]
I been servin' niggas since 1985
Niggas want the gutter
Ice Cube, Jay-O Felony
My nigga Gangsta, Squeek Rule
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta

[Ice Cube Hook X2]
Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Ain't the rugged shit

[Verse 1 Ice Cube]
Keep it gangsta y'all, I want to thank you all
Niggas comin' with that bullshit, it's gankin' y'all
We can ride to this kinda shit and bank them all
Nigga ball 'till you fall motherfucker thats all
Can't none of y'all hang with me putin' in work
Turn this motherfucker up unless you goin' to church
Nowadays, crazy ass bitches want they bills paid
But can't even make a good thang of kool-aid (ha ha)
But chicken heads get chicken feed (bahk bakh)
(a) Lil' dick and weed (bahk bakh)
Everything that a chicken need (bahk bakh)
Tryin' to pot I get real as Chris Rock
Make a bitch hot, turn into Fort Knox (bitch know)
It's Ice Cube comin' straight from the gutter
Westcoast Don, you fags undastata

[Verse 2 Jay-O-Felony]
There is sa-lethal in the gas chamber
I'm full of anger, nigga the west is in the house
But you still in for some danger
And when I'm thru, I take your bitch and finger bang her
But if she looks tossed up, i'll slang her
Beat you like mama dearest with a clothes hanger
Cuz the gang a niggas be tryin' to spit
But you can't spit it like this
I come equiped to rip, any battle
And leave him strung in his crew
But they put me in the twist like Trump
I can collapse or puncture, the lungs of anyone
Give him a chance to spit his last word, unerve
Then he done
20/20 ain't good enough
Rappers they ain't seein' me, this Jay-O Felony
And nobody can stand three of me
Caution keep MC's out of my reach, I'm on a mission
And be gettin' to your fuckin' hide to be called a physician
Immediately, I puts it down at a show (Jay-O)
But loked to choke the shit out a fool, nigga dat's on doo low

[Bridge Ice Cube]
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)

Illuminaughty, bitch hoes in they body

Fuck the party, come on, my niggas focus

Niggas notice, as soon as you're checking quotas
We the coldest, so go and tell the rollers (biotch!)

[Verse 4 Gangsta]
Who dat? next out the game, in blue kahks
Gangsta's the name, niggas wonderin' how I do that
By the thug way, package and transportin' the drug way
Only means of makin' a livin', the Crip and Blood way
I'm on grates when I'm grindin'
I'm on stakes when I'm dinnin'
And on sunday's on the wine
Is you can't calm the savage beast (never)
And I can make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em
You sell 'em, I swell 'em, loke (sell 'em loke)
Hard or soft determines how much a nigga sell 'em for
We got the fish scale texture (fish scale)
Now if you cook it yourself you get extras
Dub that shit to death with this dub thang
Only a few niggas left with this love mang
So we cop together (yeah), put it in the beeker
Rock together (uhh), claim blocks together
And fuck cock together, nigga (brrrph!)

[Ice Cube Hook X2]
Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Ain't the rugged shit

[Squeek Rule]

[Verse 5 Squeek Rule]
Look in my eyes
I see the dollar sign dogg, and my dick start to rise
Got to handle money, got to stack the money (tell 'em)
Buzzin' like a bee cuz I crave for the honey
Million dollar tickets make bitches look wicked
So you innocent hoes, ain't got to like ta kick it
I know you knows (uhh), cuz now my decimals (yep)
Done fiend for the green, keep you itchin' in your panty hose
Your eyes full of gleem (brrrmmph!)
You wanna get on my team, and live my dream
Captain of the ship is what I'm boastin'
Hit the three wheel motion, I'm the shit when I'm coastin' (uh huh)
Down the boulevard, flossin' hard
Lights hit the chrome, don't go lick 'em like a movie star
Money makes me a savage (what it do?)
Shit, I brake down the world for the cabbage (Squeek Rule)

[Bridge Ice Cube]
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta

I can give it to you but whatcha gon do wit it
I can give it to you but wha-wha wha-wha whaaat

[Verse 1: Jayo Felony]
I can give it to ya but whatcha gonna do wit it
When I'm in Texas I'm bumpin' screw music
With Big Mike and Scarface with Luke Loop
Me and lil' Crook like Bo and Luke Duke
When I'm in Miami I go to scoop Luke
To see the peep show and hit some duke shoot
Went to Branson, back to back, Lex Coupe
Up in "Harlem World" in my Timb boots
Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot
Called up Benny Rat, copped a bullet proof
Seen T-Funk he took us to the fruit
Then he went to the Tunnel and brought down the roof
Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin' sweat
Slang a cassette to Funkmaster Flex
And now I'm bumpin' on East Coast tapedecks
Went from Swatch to platinum Rolex
S.D., Jersey we getting more sex, flow next, go next

[Hook]

[Hook]
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low ridahh (2x)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
If my niggas can't eat then y'all niggas can't sleep
I just begun to creep, Nightmares on Elm Street
Release from Jones Beach to South Beach, capisce?
Kickin' dust as I bust, fuck peace
And all them crooked cops on the beat
My niggas bring the funk like your Grandpa feet
'Til death do us part, save my bullets for the charts
With darts, like HBO watching after dark
No love for a mark, even less for a trick
That wanna be like Mike, Mike who? My dick
Real shit Hot Nicks
Run wit my niggas that ain't got shit
Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit
One time, out for mine, but can't stop it
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic
Leave the crime scene spotless
Mix the green with the chocolate, here's the topic
Niggas, synchronize your watches
We goin in, wit nothin' but a Clan logo
Mr. meth, (DMX!) I'm running loco motherfucker

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
I got a wicked flow and I'm gonna kick it yo, feel the pressure
Snatching niggas up just like change off the dresser
Niggas hit me with they best shit, then what
I shake that bullshit off *arf arf arf* then go nuts
Ive been down too long, can't a motherfucker show me nothing
Y'all bitch niggas is duckin' me like you owe me something
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say
I couldn't talk you wouldn't walk my way on your best day
The best way you can hope to get close to me
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be
The first time you start acting fuckin' strange
Best to be ducking range
Talkin' shit wearing a fuckin' chain
I break niggas like promises
Split em' open like Thomas's
And sell more drugs than a pharmacist
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime
Attitude that doesn't mind doing time

[Hook]

[Hook]{*ten seconds of instrumental to open*}

Yuh, bounce like it's a earthquake, Nitty shake
Let's see how much noise it make the city make
You see it's just another day in my neighborhood
And the police ain't fuckin with me, knock on wood
For my shoes, cause she just blew my socks so good
Double shot, never knew I'd shoot my Glock so good (pow!)
I rock like coke when they hit
And they just cain't do it but they all wanna spit
Put my Padre head on, but see I tried to warn him
Fuck around boy you know it goes down (in California)

[W.C.]
Ba-block, ba-block, deep in the slums
Here they come come with the new Chucks on
Click-click, ba-block, ba-block, green in my lungs
Straight from Killa Cali got the one one one
With a tall stack in all black
With that Louis trimmin on our golf cap
Known to make 'em all fall back
It's that - Mr. Fuck Everybody I Can't Stand
And bust random
C-Walkin on another anthem
Tryin to teach these new rappers some manners
Chasin niggas out of the mic booth with a camera
Back at it loc it's Da Lench Mob and I'm more {?}
Than a can of blow, bust ya head open like canteloupe
You niggas is pussy pretend to be, we run the vicinity
Walk in the +Circle+ and lose your virginity
Put these khakis on and get out them speedos
And bow down, cause without us, there wouldn't be no

Looped out, satined out -

Niggas can't see me cause I kill shit blowin'

A-K-47 street, quick to get ya
My lyrics like missiles to hit Hitler
Motherfucker stay up out my Kool-Aid pitcher
You don't wanna see my style like click-click pow
Make you bow to my wicked style, make you my child
The enemy wanna diss, nigga but how could he?
We hookers and hoodies, with a bag full of goodies, what!?
Now take that for what it's worth
I'll terrorize your territory and take over your turf
All these niggas is rob, but they was soft as a Nerf
Nasty as after birth, they say "ooh" after the verse

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm commercial, universal with no rehearsal
And when I'm in the hood I'm just so controversial
Niggas know me homie - the O.G
West Coast Don, I'll smash on anyone

And prepare to get ill when the gangstas talk
Saggin' and flaggin' with the '7-trey draggin'
Smokin' like a dragon with the .4-4 cannon

Gray and Blue bandanna's, hoo-ridin' is standard
So what y'all wanna say? (Huh, huh?)
What y'all wanna do? (Huh, huh?)

[Butch Cassidy]
You niggas trippin', while I'm steady dippin'

L.B.C. huh?
S.D.C.?
Fuck I heard it was uh, D.P.G[Mack 10]
I'm screamin as I'm dreamin, I see evil bad spirits
So I wake up in the middle of the night to write lyrics
In a cold sweat, heard magnums in my dreams, my ears ring
So this time on the mic I bring horror like Stephen King
All my good times are turned bad like the Evan's
Seen hundreds get wounded but like a thousand 187's
Everybody that was so real, they were now phony
And the nigga that used to be my homie, shit he turned on me
I got a 45 that spit hot lead that'll drill him
The nigga know too much about me, so it's a must that I kill him
If it's time available at the shrink, man I need to spend it
Cuz now I see the chair rockin, but ain't nobody in it
I'm psycho like Norman Bates in the fresh side of my mind and
All I think about is comittin redrums like The Shining
So Lord please help me and forgive me for my sins
And tell me, why do I deserve the twilight zone that I'm in?
Somebody ease the pain I need a shot of novacaine
Or angel dust smoke circulatin through my brain
So who got the slaughter water, la la the brain killer
I got five on it, four stick, to the first dealer
With no screws left it's like my head is now hollow
I'm so crazy seems like my own shadow's scared to follow
Ain't that a bitch, 1-O caught up in the horror show
But ain't no popcorn or bon bons, it's all teflons nigga

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a 44 everywhere I go
It's 1-O in the ghetto horror show

[Jayo Felony]
I'm slangin ?nocous? on the boulders
Keys, O-Z's and quarters
Come along, get up, stand up, and come and get your sack
I'm bustin nigga's hearts with this motherfuckin crack
I'm sayin please oh please oh please give me just one more hit
Now I'm surrounded by skinny motherfuckers with glass dicks
I'll jack Jack and Jill, smack Bill Clinton and his bitch
Tell po po they can't fade me I'll kill him and his snitch
I'm a bad influence, I'm a bad influence
And motherfuckers don't wanna know what I'll tell these fuckin kids
Fuck school nigga, bang with me
Why you gotta get a job nigga, slang with me
Listen, my 44 protects ya if any nigga tries to test ya
Nigga who the fuck is you? I'm Peer Pressure
Took the last bit of the thorazine, I'm at the end of the rainbow
There ain't no fuckin pot of gold, just the ghetto horror show
There we go

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a AK everywhere I go
It's Jayo in the ghetto horror show

[Ice Cube]
I got to testify, I grew up in this ghetto horror
?Justaora? got me spittin from the ghetto Torah
Ghetto bible survival I'm hittin rivals in their vitals
Tryin to rob titles, from livin idols
I give recitals on the drugs to sex to county checks to Lex
Your respect from the hot techs
And it's the same for me cuz the fame don't wipe away the black
Westside can't react
Braniac with this maniac, get to losin 'fore the schools get to oozin
And your bitch get to ?twosin?
The niggas at 600 pools and like the Pope
Get on the fuckin city F niggas like to vote
It's the horror, no tomorrow in your eyes
But look at me nigga I believe I can fly
You believe you can die, well shit it might happen
I believe I can rhyme and look, I start rappin nigga

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a tech nine everywhere I go
It's Ice Cube in the ghetto horror show

[Mack 10 talking]
What is time? Huh, time is divded by two
Before it happens, and after it happens
Right now, we callin it the ghetto horrow show

[Some guy]
Only a fool would go there at night![Intro]
Welcome to California
Remix (echo)

[Verse 1 - Mack 10]
Uh Westcoast
Mack 10, Sly Boogy and the rest of the homies, look...

See I was raised at the gutter
And no matter what happened I got that raw cane & water
I ain't dependin' on rappin'
And I ain't wit the disrespect, watch ya mouth when ya yappin
I grab the homies and some bullies, hit ya block and start clappin
And I got so much aqua, my traps got floods on it
Gettin' that rubber band money and who cares if Bloods is on it
Mack 10, one of the few West Coasters to shine
And most of them got the mainstream, the hood is mine

[Verse 2 - Jayo Felony]
Man, I'm quick to tell a killer that I'm iller than he is
See, and I'm a G since it's me and my peeps, please
Look I'm the quickest no stitches, hit switches
And I love these witches that be gobblin' snobbishness
We takin' wrist watches, we be plottin' on change main
Why did I hit you up? Homie this is the gang thang
Can't hang with us gorillas, main, you just an orangutan
Sly and Bullet Loco gone bring these killers PAIN!

[Verse 3 - Sly Boogy]
Right, aight, hold up, trip (ha ha!)
Me and my niggas came to blow up shit (yeah)
And show these niggas how to flow that spit (yeah)
And quit actin' like some ho-ass tricks (Sly Boogy)
Fool, you know who the hell it is (yeah)
I'm clickin' up wit all my cousins and relatives
And you could roll wit us and rep yo block
And we could show these motherfuckers how the West Coast rock
So come on

[Hook - Butch Cassidy]
Everybody all around the world (yeah)
All the little baby boys and girls (alright)
Can't sleep cause they wanna know what's goin' on in California
All the seeds all across the globe
People comin' from coast to coast
For the show cause they wanna know what's goin' on in California

[Verse 4 - E-40]
Talk to me, I talk back, ain't no need to explain
Y'all know my name
Y'all know who this is rappin' over this steel trap
Y'all know it's the man wit the slang
Use no pedal when pushin' that cane
Everything that I ever sold in the street it was top grade
Magazines, three mics, sprinkle truth in the game, spit the venom
Every rapper got a little E-40 up in em
Every rapper off the heezy fo sheezy
I thought you plot 'em wit Jigga down
For shit got down

[Verse 5 - Kurupt]
Switches, bitches, chrome deep dishes
Impalas, pop collars and pop collar bones
It's California, Gangstaville, in ya mouth, all up on ya
Cologne, you California
I'm Chuck All Stars, chronic sack, skull hat, Nissan truck
Not to give a fuck, Kurupt
86 gang bang, World War 3
Thunder Dome, Crenshaw, Chemical Ali
California nigga!

[HOOK]

[Verse 6 - Crooked I]
The women hop in the whip
They love the way the speakers be subbin' in eight places
I represent Cali like Governor Gray Davis
On roller coaster rims, I own my own company pal
I'm slangin' spinners, how you lovin' me now
In L.A. you gotta be do or die in junior high
He's Sly Boogy, I'm Crooked I and we ride - you know?
And I'm Death Row, heartless and lethal
You seen Menace to Society, I should start in the sequel
Yeeah

[Verse 7 - Roscoe]
Blaze up the sticky dro, raise up the '64
Sittin' low at the liquor store
He's better than generous, inconsiderate
On a shwe wit a cigarette
You know that nigga Young Roscoe rollin' in the Cadillac
Rag on these (on these)
I got my Khakillac saggin' wit the crease
And everybody wanna know like, "what's up wit Sco?"
It's Y.A. Killafornia!

[Verse 8 - 2Pac]
Know for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin' me
And nah it ain't the drugs, it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery is automatic, lettin' niggas have it
I been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks, ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a, catch a nigga worldwide
A fucking Mob Figga, West Coast who ride

[HOOK]

(Outro)

We hope you have enjoyed your stay (echo)
Think about this stuff (echo)[Mack 10]
I'm screamin as I'm dreamin, I see evil bad spirits
So I wake up in the middle of the night to write lyrics
In a cold sweat, heard magnums in my dreams, my ears ring
So this time on the mic I bring horror like Stephen King
All my good times are turned bad like the Evan's
Seen hundreds get wounded but like a thousand 187's
Everybody that was so real, they were now phony
And the nigga that used to be my homie, shit he turned on me
I got a 45 that spit hot lead that'll drill him
The nigga know too much about me, so it's a must that I kill him
If it's time available at the shrink, man I need to spend it
Cuz now I see the chair rockin, but ain't nobody in it
I'm psycho like Norman Bates in the fresh side of my mind and
All I think about is comittin redrums like The Shining
So Lord please help me and forgive me for my sins
And tell me, why do I deserve the twilight zone that I'm in?
Somebody ease the pain I need a shot of novacaine
Or angel dust smoke circulatin through my brain
So who got the slaughter water, la la the brain killer
I got five on it, four stick, to the first dealer
With no screws left it's like my head is now hollow
I'm so crazy seems like my own shadow's scared to follow
Ain't that a bitch, 1-O caught up in the horror show
But ain't no popcorn or bon bons, it's all teflons nigga

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a 44 everywhere I go
It's 1-O in the ghetto horror show

[Jayo Felony]
I'm slangin ?nocous? on the boulders
Keys, O-Z's and quarters
Come along, get up, stand up, and come and get your sack
I'm bustin nigga's hearts with this motherfuckin crack
I'm sayin please oh please oh please give me just one more hit
Now I'm surrounded by skinny motherfuckers with glass dicks
I'll jack Jack and Jill, smack Bill Clinton and his bitch
Tell po po they can't fade me I'll kill him and his snitch
I'm a bad influence, I'm a bad influence
And motherfuckers don't wanna know what I'll tell these fuckin kids
Fuck school nigga, bang with me
Why you gotta get a job nigga, slang with me
Listen, my 44 protects ya if any nigga tries to test ya
Nigga who the fuck is you? I'm Peer Pressure
Took the last bit of the thorazine, I'm at the end of the rainbow
There ain't no fuckin pot of gold, just the ghetto horror show
There we go

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a AK everywhere I go
It's Jayo in the ghetto horror show

[Ice Cube]
I got to testify, I grew up in this ghetto horror
?Justaora? got me spittin from the ghetto Torah
Ghetto bible survival I'm hittin rivals in their vitals
Tryin to rob titles, from livin idols
I give recitals on the drugs to sex to county checks to Lex
Your respect from the hot techs
And it's the same for me cuz the fame don't wipe away the black
Westside can't react
Braniac with this maniac, get to losin 'fore the schools get to oozin
And your bitch get to ?twosin?
The niggas at 600 pools and like the Pope
Get on the fuckin city F niggas like to vote
It's the horror, no tomorrow in your eyes
But look at me nigga I believe I can fly
You believe you can die, well shit it might happen
I believe I can rhyme and look, I start rappin nigga

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a tech nine everywhere I go
It's Ice Cube in the ghetto horror show

[Mack 10 talking]
What is time? Huh, time is divded by two
Before it happens, and after it happens
Right now, we callin it the ghetto horrow show

[Some guy]
Only a fool would go there at night![Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, yeah
It's another one of those...
Snoop D-O-Double G, L.T. Hutton thangs

Chorus: Snoop Dogg (repeat 4X)

If you got beef, with DPG

Bridge: Charlie Wilson, Snoop

[C. W.] Any problems any problems you can holla at my dogg....
[S. D.] Holla, holla
[C. W.] Holla at my dogg, you could holla at my dogg, ohhhhh
Any problems any problems you could holla at my dogg
Holla at my dogg, holla at my dogg, heeeeey heeeeeeey

Chorus 1/2

[Jayo Felony]
The life I lead
The average nigga would have broke down a long time ago
Try to bang in a show and get slumped like The Crow
Anyday now, we gonna run at my nigga them killas is Nathal
We see it all like night owls and we stay on the prowl
They don't wanna see me shine again
They fuckin' with my mind again
But as soon as I finish this Heineken
I gotta go get my nine again
(It got a body on it from a party don't it?)
Yeah I been tryin' to slang it, but don't nobody want it
They can't help you with band-aids, we comin' with grenades
You ain't seen this many niggas in your life with diamonds and braids
I'm from the home where they get sprayed and gang related raids
Fuck y'all, that start bangin' after "Colors" was made
Let's C-walk to that, and never give me no hassle
Cause I come from one of the worst cottage in Paso

Chorus

[Tray Deee]
It ain't no mystery you dissin' me you dissin' my clique
And ain't no question we come steppin' straight to get in your shit
So why you actin' like a bitch? Puttin' your business on wax
When we could scrap or slap a clip, if you wanted to crack
See in the pen we got a name for niggas runnin' they yap
Sale soldiers, roll 'em up with somethin' up in they back
Handles ours, battle scars, Shackles, guards and all
And we the last niggas standin' once they start to fall
Make the call, or fuck it, just kick off the brawl
Cuz I'm ridin' with my doggs, win, lose, or draw
Dogg pound insane, neighborhood twenty gangin' it
And every gangsta that I hang with down to bang
Full time pull mines and I gots to bust
Fuck a pass, when I mash, anybody get touched
So make my name taste just like a dick in your mouth
And watch the way you on my nuts when you spittin' it out
Dogghouse

Repeat Bridge

Chorus 1/4X

[Sylk E. Fine]
You got a muthafuckin' problem with my niggas then you got one with me
It's the S to the Y, the L, just drop three keys
As I flee, to the homie L.T.'s, to make the magic
It's those that talk, and those that make shit happen
So what'cha say? You wanna spit? You got beef?
D.P serve the heat, straight to the street
Honey west, I make the mission complete
Therefore them bitches who talk that shit
Be them bitches that's gettin' they ass beat

[Snoop Dogg]
Now don't come round here fuckin' with us
Cuz on the real homeboy, we'll be fuckin' you up
And to you bitches who be thinking y'all could slide by
With that punk shit, BITCH, biddity bye bye
I fuck a bitch up faster than I do a nigga
See to me, most bitches is women but bitch you'z a nigga
We got rules and codes, G's and hoes
Friends and foes, ride or get rode on

Chorus 1/4x)

[Snoop Dogg]
Nigga, nigga, bitch[Ice Cube]
I been servin' niggas since 1985
Niggas want the gutter

Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta

[Ice Cube Hook X2]
Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Ain't the rugged shit

[Verse 1 Ice Cube]
Keep it gangsta y'all, I want to thank you all
Niggas comin' with that bullshit, it's gankin' y'all
We can ride to this kinda shit and bank them all
Nigga ball 'till you fall motherfucker thats all
Can't none of y'all hang with me putin' in work
Turn this motherfucker up unless you goin' to church
Nowadays, crazy ass bitches want they bills paid
But can't even make a good thang of kool-aid (ha ha)
But chicken heads get chicken feed (bahk bakh)
(a) Lil' dick and weed (bahk bakh)
Everything that a chicken need (bahk bakh)
Tryin' to pot I get real as Chris Rock
Make a bitch hot, turn into Fort Knox (bitch know)
It's Ice Cube comin' straight from the gutter
Westcoast Don, you fags undastata

[Verse 2 Jay-O-Felony]
There is sa-lethal in the gas chamber
I'm full of anger, nigga the west is in the house
But you still in for some danger
And when I'm thru, I take your bitch and finger bang her
But if she looks tossed up, i'll slang her
Beat you like mama dearest with a clothes hanger
Cuz the gang a niggas be tryin' to spit
But you can't spit it like this
I come equiped to rip, any battle
And leave him strung in his crew
But they put me in the twist like Trump
I can collapse or puncture, the lungs of anyone
Give him a chance to spit his last word, unerve
Then he done
20/20 ain't good enough
Rappers they ain't seein' me, this Jay-O Felony
And nobody can stand three of me
Caution keep MC's out of my reach, I'm on a mission
And be gettin' to your fuckin' hide to be called a physician
Immediately, I puts it down at a show (Jay-O)
But loked to choke the shit out a fool, nigga dat's on doo low

[Bridge Ice Cube]
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)

Niggas notice, as soon as you're checking quotas
We the coldest, so go and tell the rollers (biotch!)

[Verse 4 Gangsta]
Who dat? next out the game, in blue kahks
Gangsta's the name, niggas wonderin' how I do that
By the thug way, package and transportin' the drug way
Only means of makin' a livin', the Crip and Blood way
I'm on grates when I'm grindin'
I'm on stakes when I'm dinnin'
And on sunday's on the wine
Is you can't calm the savage beast (never)
And I can make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em
You sell 'em, I swell 'em, loke (sell 'em loke)
Hard or soft determines how much a nigga sell 'em for
We got the fish scale texture (fish scale)
Now if you cook it yourself you get extras
Dub that shit to death with this dub thang
Only a few niggas left with this love mang
So we cop together (yeah), put it in the beeker
Rock together (uhh), claim blocks together
And fuck cock together, nigga (brrrph!)

[Ice Cube Hook X2]
Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Ain't the rugged shit

[Squeek Rule]

[Verse 5 Squeek Rule]
Look in my eyes
I see the dollar sign dogg, and my dick start to rise
Got to handle money, got to stack the money (tell 'em)
Buzzin' like a bee cuz I crave for the honey
Million dollar tickets make bitches look wicked
So you innocent hoes, ain't got to like ta kick it
I know you knows (uhh), cuz now my decimals (yep)
Done fiend for the green, keep you itchin' in your panty hose
Your eyes full of gleem (brrrmmph!)
You wanna get on my team, and live my dream
Captain of the ship is what I'm boastin'
Hit the three wheel motion, I'm the shit when I'm coastin' (uh huh)
Down the boulevard, flossin' hard
Lights hit the chrome, don't go lick 'em like a movie star
Money makes me a savage (what it do?)
Shit, I brake down the world for the cabbage (Squeek Rule)

[Bridge Ice Cube]
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta

Yuh, bounce like it's a earthquake, Nitty shake

For my shoes, cause she just blew my socks so good
Double shot, never knew I'd shoot my Glock so good (pow!)

And they just cain't do it but they all wanna spit
Put my Padre head on, but see I tried to warn him
Fuck around boy you know it goes down (in California)

[W.C.]
Ba-block, ba-block, deep in the slums
Here they come come with the new Chucks on
Click-click, ba-block, ba-block, green in my lungs
Straight from Killa Cali got the one one one
With a tall stack in all black
With that Louis trimmin on our golf cap
Known to make 'em all fall back
It's that - Mr. Fuck Everybody I Can't Stand
And bust random
C-Walkin on another anthem
Tryin to teach these new rappers some manners
Chasin niggas out of the mic booth with a camera
Back at it loc it's Da Lench Mob and I'm more {?}
Than a can of blow, bust ya head open like canteloupe
You niggas is pussy pretend to be, we run the vicinity
Walk in the +Circle+ and lose your virginity
Put these khakis on and get out them speedos
And bow down, cause without us, there wouldn't be no
(California)

[Outro]

Llello (llello) but if I do that's what I do (that's what I do)
*repeat 2X*

[Verse One: E-40]
Grindin out of my Aunties, backyard that's the chronic
I been havin more candy than a pinata, more cake than Betty Crocker
Get on the horn and hit me on my locker, cause I'm fake ID havin
Strikin and drivin on a suspended expired license comes in buy it
From the nigga with the best quality and the lowest prices
Spendin that capital that the big homey advanced me
In front of me with the next nigga
I love money plus I'm labelled rough rider
Known for bringin bitch ass niggas out of hidin

[Jayo Felony]
Charlie Hustle, I hope I won't have to go back
To sellin sherm sticks, but if I do that's what I do
Charlie Hustle, I hope I won't have to go back
To sellin loop loop, but if I do that's what I do

[Verse Two: Jayo Felony]
I stabs a nigga, and Kool-Aid came out
Cause his heart pumps Kool-Aid, so I mixed it with my Thunderchicken
Barely livin, and smokin headache with a deuce-deuce
Now I gotta put my snub nosed back to use
I'm dangerous it gets crucial, cause I loves conflict
Fuck a headache I'm jackin niggas for pounds of bomb shit
And now my fingers is sticky like Sticky Fingaz from the greenery
You gon' retaliate, nigga what that mean to me? Bitch!
When you shoot crooked it's Cartwright, on site I'm takin flight
It's gon' rain on your head, I'm tearin the roof off this bitch tonight
As you fall like Guy, for tryin to swipe my pie
Nigga DIE while your bitch give up the Beaumont

Chorus:

[Jayo] All my niggas havin fancy dreams! (FANCY DREAMS!)
Comin up cause we all on a money scheme! (A money scheme!)

[Verse Three: E-40]
RRRRAP for free, nigga FUCK the hype
BEOTCH! You gotta pay me just to BREATHE on the mic
High, higher than a dust cloud
Hella disrespectful, all up in the party talkin loud!
Systemized, a triple striker, when I was born
My mom and daddy shoulda named me Isiah cause I'm a Rider
Sole survivor, Hillsider, 1400 block Magazine Street
Narcotic ? bomb preparer heroin provider
I'm vicious, mean mugged and mad doggin niggas like the
Like the Grinch Who Stole Christmas
I like to, like to, finger fuck bitches up in clubs
Take her home and get rug burns on my nuts!
Stuck! Gordon's Gin and Donald Duck
NUT! All on her spine and on her butt
FUCK! Major clientele (major clientele)
Then I pass it to my nigga Mista Jayo

[Verse Four: Jayo Felony]
? up the glass is shatterin, bitch it ain't matterin
They scatterin, see me and forty start splatterin
The cowards are heartless, so you burn like flames
Niggas that got snake eyes get broke up like dice games
Fuck a bitch, why? Cause skeezers don't please us
So I just go around sippin fine wine like Jesus
And everytime I bust a spit it's a hip-hop quote
Drinkin Moesha Brandy, head spinnin like hundred spokes

[Hook]

[Verse Five: Jayo Felony]
Still drinkin Krypton
Brothers is Snapple then I snap like a snapping turtle
Nigga, shittin on the world keeps my land fertile
I grow my own shit, fruits, vegetables and tobacco
It's third down and forty nigga
You know you gon' get tackled
Get your land while you can old man
Niggas so dope they named me twice like Duran Duran
Killa nigga put honey on em, and feed em to my hogs
See I leave no evidence for the police dogs
Now off the low stroll we go so let's flow
Lil' bitch, we the shit because the people said so
You can't tell a lettuce from a cabbage silly rabbits
Get these chips even if it means lettin these motherfuckers have it!

[Verse Six: E-40]
Nigga got out of line, I had to ice him
Reached into my drawers, and pulled out my strap
Motherfucker got out of place, I had to chop him
Reached into my d-da-da-das and pulled out my strap, check it out
Nickle plated chrome planet Clint Eastwood special
Designed strictly for staplin and toe taggin
Po-Po wrote me up a citation cause I was saggin and draggin
My b-ah-bitch, by her w-uh-weave
I had to, I had to make the bitch bleed! Last New Year's Eve
She tried to hit me with a fryin pan, my attitude wasn't carin
Backslapped that ho in front of her parents
More ki's than a janitor
It gets mannisher and mannisher and mannisher
Smokin on a roach, loitering in a McDonald's parkin lot
Throwin up gang signs
To ? as if he was some kind of first base coach
I luh I like my egg poached, hard over easy!!!
In the drive through, hollerin at her breezy!!!

[Hook]

*talking to end*[ VERSE 1: Jayo Felony ]
I knew I was gone before they even put the handcuffs on
A whole chicken in the back of the Brougham
Rocked up, so I knew that I was locked up
Got a good lawyer but can't do nothin for ya
But they got chronic, I chills and get my puff on
Eat Ramen, hit my fifi, lift weights and get my buff on
These hoochies are trippin but I expect that, see
All on another fool's jock but they can't get a dime from me
But you my gee, see, and we supposed to be tight
So why the fuck you didn't send me no kite?
I been down for two and ain't heard a thing from you
See, that ain't the thang to do, let's keep this bangin true, blue
If it was you, you would want me to do the same thing
How you gon' slip and leave your homie on the hang?
I gots no time for you busters and you snitches
This is for the real - niggas and the bitches

[ VERSE 2: Jayo Felony ]
I had a down one, she kept my books on fat
We used to do it like this, then we would do it like that
This is for the real, to hell with the faker
I was on my bunk bed bumpin Anita Baker
Wishin I was in a hot thub gettin my back rubbed
Instead of bein in here with 4'000 thugs
I remember all the letters you wrote and the cards you sent
And them ends when you had to pay rent
But you would always get yours and couldn't nothin stop ya
Tight Guess and K-Swiss lookin proper
And you were proud to be Ms. Bullet Loco
Fool, don't phantasize off my foto
Even though you knew I was mackin you still stuck with me
Remindin me to stay sucker free
And when I touched down you kickin in straight riches
This is for the real - niggas and the bitches

[ VERSE 3: Jayo Felony ]
And now I'm fresh out, I was a C but they doubt me
Much love to the bitches that didn't forget about me
Because I surely won't forget about you
And everybody knows what the fuck I'm gon' do
Blow up from the flo' up, grow up and don't be to' up
The hoes that tried to clown, I diss them hookers like throw-up
I'm tryin to learn to keep my black ass on the streets
No more shackles on my feet
Makin funky hits like this I can't miss
Jam-Master Jay and T-Funk and my nigga Cool Chris
So when I'm at a picnic gettin my mob on
Don't walk up on me, we might have to get our squab on
And my female got a mouthpiece
Protection for the wicked streets of Southeast
My day is too short for you marks and you snitches
This is for the real - niggas and the bitches[Method Man]

Mista Meth in the house! Ha, yeah, break it down

[Xzibit]

When it's all said in done, we gon' be on top
Cause we don't stop, now, lock it down, hit the spot
And clown; Niggas relyin on special effects
While the khakis and chronic, got the bitches still breakin they neck
Move the crowd without breakin a sweat
Trend setter, with a Beretta, so keep it on deck
Cause you never know when Xzibit gonna roll through the set
Don't be scared, just be prepared and quiet as kept
At a night club, talkin bout you don't go out
And you tryin to got to school to make a certain amount
But the last part, I just couldn't figure it out
I guess its real hard to talk with a dick in your mouth
Lightweight, like confetti, steadily tested by motherfuckers who ain't ready
To deal with the legendary
Soopafly, X-Z, and Bullet Loco
Shot callers, clear the whole block like we po-po

[Chorus: Method Man]

Round and round we go, it don't stop
Till we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot
Baby girl to the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!
Lookin good with your stink-ass
Type of ass make a nigga pull it over fast
Make it hot, baby girl to pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop pop!

[Jayo Felony]

Well, you gotta pop the pussy, get rid of the next with a name on your gums
Mr. Du Lo gang bitch, who the hell want some
You got titties and ass
But I got a dick and some cash
You ain't talkin bout shit
Then I'ma smash, bitch
On three, on me, bitch, you my property
Daddy Jayo Felony, ain't nobody stoppin me
And I said daddy, bitch thats what you gon' call me
I ain't no simp or a wimp
I'ma motherfuckin pimp
Terrorizin' my hoes, make they high-heels fall off
You got me ? the fuck-up, if you think I'm goin soft
On ya; I'm hard on my hoes that's how it goes
Bitch, get up off your toes, and get my six-four
? My name, you bounced, so you might as well break bread
And only Du Lo niggas know, whats the head
My name is Billy Loco and this is my opinion
I'm coming from SD, and Du Lo is my religion
Be-b-b-b- atch!

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]

I don't save or pray, or ? clothes
All I really wanna do is win the game, fuck hoes!
In Jamaica, at the Half Moon Villa, with a killa
And a cocain dealer, layin low from the law
See it all comes down to who's quick to draw first
Pay attention, prevention, ridin off in a hearse
Mister X to the you know me
Thousand-dollar bitches wanna pop the pussy for free
The disfunctional member of the Alkoholik family tree
Frequently bang bitches, Wu-Tang, Killer Bee
Hennessey on the rocks, with Pina Coloda
At the Ramada, make you work hard like Donna
For the cheese, got you down on your hands and knees
After that we kick back and burn up some trees
Mad shout, cause Xzibit's not the type to be treatin
I'm an Alkaholik and I'm late for my meeting
(Come on, Like that!)

[Chorus][Intro: DJ Eazy Dick]
Oh y'all just wanna do with out the beat
Uh well fuck it we gon' do it like this
On radio station motherfuckin' 187.4 bitch
W Ballz part two huh?
Peep game broadcasting
Provided by mother fucking Emena huh?

Emena... not Enema... Enema!
I'm sayin' it baby, I just said it low

Ok like this, we gon' clean it up like this, huh punk bitch

[Kurupt]
Man what a bitch, gangsta shit

I never love me a ho
Just to remind y'all bitches in case you didn't know
I breaks fool all niggas, way cool all niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, sawed off y'all niggas
And I'm quick to pull out
Gangsta shit, tell a bitch to stick a dick in her mouth

[Daz Dillinger]
As I skip to my loo, C-Walkin', G talkin'
I'm a gangsta, cold hearted, sick, dumb and retarted
Came up this far without a bullet proof vest (yeah)
Ran with the best, sport khaki's again
Always stay fresh won't settle for less
Looped out, satined out -

[Soopafly]
Man these niggas on deck
Now it's the pimp of the crew, Soopafly comin' through
I got a dick and a couple balls just to name a few
The D.P. locced out, niggas get choked out
Smoked out niggas that'll fuck you up no doubt

[Tray Deee]
Gangsta gangsta, tell me how you do it
It seems so simple like there was nothin' to it
Rippin', sippin', dippin' on the fluid

[Jayo Felony]
I have so much beef I shoulda fucked up my colon
But I sent 'em off deprived, with both they fuckin' eyes swollen
Everything stolen and it's still rich rollin'
Niggas can't see me cause I kill shit blowin'
I let loose like ain't no tomorrow with bomb beats
A-K-47 street, quick to get ya
My lyrics like missiles to hit Hitler
Motherfucker stay up out my Kool-Aid pitcher
You don't wanna see my style like click-click pow
Make you bow to my wicked style, make you my child
The enemy wanna diss, nigga but how could he?
We hookers and hoodies, with a bag full of goodies, what!?
Now take that for what it's worth
I'll terrorize your territory and take over your turf
All these niggas is rob, but they was soft as a Nerf
Nasty as after birth, they say "ooh" after the verse

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm commercial, universal with no rehearsal
And when I'm in the hood I'm just so controversial
Niggas know me homie - the O.G
West Coast Don, I'll smash on anyone
On my daughter and my two sons, the set and my two guns
I move the dubs and let D move the 2-1's
Not to mention all my No Limit niggas now

So to kick a style, you gotta kick me down
Every nigga from the Pound gettin' paid now
Hey now, big bow wow honey child
I ran a hundred miles through about a hundred styles
And now I'm through with it, with nothin' else to do with it
Roll it, blaze it, pass it, now you hit it
We's a D.P.G. committee

Dat Nigga Daz fuck that bitch, that trick, that goofy ass bitch
Soopafly, super high, ruff cap slip, fuckin' gangsta shit

It's a gang thang, we all gang bang

[Daz Dillinger]
Hold up (Wait a minute!)
All my niggas get (Gangsta with it!)
Tick-tock (Crip Walk!)
And prepare to get ill when the gangstas talk
Saggin' and flaggin' with the '7-trey draggin'
Smokin' like a dragon with the .4-4 cannon
Be the last man standin' whoopin' niggas at random
Gray and Blue bandanna's, hoo-ridin' is standard
So what y'all wanna say? (Huh, huh?)
What y'all wanna do? (Huh, huh?)

[Butch Cassidy]
You niggas trippin', while I'm steady dippin'
Throw your clip in, since y'all all flippin'
Rollin' capers, while I'm gettin' papers
Tried to shake us, you know they caught the vapors

Ain't nobody comin' close to me
Keep hangin' 'round and you'll believe

The broadcast is directed by motherfuckin' Snoop Doggy Dogg in this biznotch

Shabadoo huh?
We gon' kick it like this to the Eastside L.B.C
L.B.C. huh?
S.D.C.?
Fuck I heard it was uh, D.P.G[Verse 1]
On fo' seven, the helicopter lights nearly blind me
In the south east streets is were you might find me
True bandana, my scanner, and my pager
In the blue 1994 one blazer
And I'm the one all the ho's wanna get wit
Jack Daniel punch and the indo spliff
You don't like the way I kick shit
You can get the dick six fo' three wheelin
Mobbin to the picnic
But somethin's missin, wake up and stop dreamin
Tyshe let's take a ride to the coast to get a demon
Bring it back to Gomper's Park before two
And everybody know what the fuck we gon' do

[Chorus]
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit (we gon smoke a sherm stick)
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit, we gon smoke a dip (sherm stick)

[Verse 2]
In the men's bathroom, fool let me have room
So I light it right, so it won't go boom
I took fo' hard hits, and passed it to the next man
Now it seems like I got powers like the X-men
Sittin on the curb, for four fuckin hours dog
Thinkin bout my homie in the pen, lil boss hog
Damn near dead, bout to head to the tilt
My homegirl woke me up, wit a carton of milk
I'm glad I didn't get caught slippin when I was sleepin
On them fools on the otherside who call themselve's creepin
But see sucka, gangs a nation crew
And everybody knows what the fuck we gon do

[Chorus]

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
(Sherm stick)

[Verse 3]
I flips the ill gangsta shit on the worst day
Bitches sayin go bullet lock it's ya birthday
My homie b.k., threw a party and we got there late
You know I had to make them ho's wait
And when I arrived, the whole shit was in a trance
Niggas gettin bong out, muthafucka a dance
Haha, gettin ready for the next batch
My homie's asshole naked, doin the muthafuckin cabbage patch
Niggas throwin up, it's a part of growin up
My piss test is straight, it ain't shit showin up
So duck, cause the next busta might be you
Now all y'all niggas know what my crew bout to do

[Chorus]

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip

Yeah, this for y'all niggas out there, and y'all bitches out there
Smokin that border, rest in peace big tray dogg, much love loc[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip Hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars driving slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned, styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is coming look around your town is crumbling
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leaving MCs listless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher, partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9ne's vilde!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house through the front window
And heard this guy shout, "Hey that's my couch"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm ripping this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flipping vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breaking so many freaking needles, I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doing drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting from high noon till the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was, when I cut ya neck
Leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon and spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinning like lead from out the  Heck and K
Tearing your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate
Until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to but what you gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you but what you gon' do
Rev can give it to you but what you gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fucking up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul file sexual harassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fucking murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show repping with Sway and Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One coming with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willing to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willing to bet, on a Sway and a Tec, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gaining respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just seckle
Ha-ha-ha, fresh for 1999 you suckers[LL Cool J](Snoop)
(Yeah, Big Snoop Dogg, X to the Z)
Yeah
(Uncle L, blast these bitch ass motherfuckers)
Yeah, Yeah

Pour your Dom on the floor, try to flow with me
Duke 'em raw with them whores, hide ya hoes from me (Whooo)
Your momma wanna chase, I'm just statin' the fact
L.A. think about your broad all I want is the stacks
Cats flashin' in my face is who I'm laughin' at *HaHaHaHa*
So you made a little dough, but wutchu doin' wit that?
Thought 'cha girl ain't feelin me
Why she grillin' me, Black?
Admit I'm the man or else I'll twist ya uterus back
On my lap, in the jet to Miami and back
When I tear through new school, all y'all records is whack
I'm from Q, for Quiet Killers
And U know I deliver
The double N, enough ammo for every nigga
S, that spell Queens stupid ass, run it back
That HBO shit, I must address that
Once and for all, what's my opinion on Jamie Foxx?
He pussy. Pussy ain't funny as Chris Rock, Ha

[Hook: LL Cool J](Snoop){Xzibit}[Both]
You can't fuck wit me
{Can't fuck with me}
I don't care about your imagery
(Fuck, nigga)
Give a fuck who you claim to be

You can't fuck wit me
[You can't fuck with me]
I don't care about your imagery

Give a fuck who you claim to be
{Yeah}(Nigga what)
You still can't fuck wit me

[Jayo Felony]
No Go
Who you thought it was? Don't be fuckin' wit my Uncle, 'cuz
One does up dick the pen in my streets go one way
I kill 'em In Living Color, on Any Given Sunday
They all anxious to be waitin' to see how ill is my style
And if it enough to make Kevin Lyle spit this out right now
And get em with Juvenile feed pitbull puppies, bologna in the projects
You wanna die next?
Nah, he wanna live, and he loves his kids
We got this rap game on lock, like a cake rock
Gimme the key, run up in your spot
Like, you on your belly, gimme the key
What is it gonne be, what it is gonne see
When your blutter don't mean
And if he keep tryna wipe it off, like "Nigga, what's this song mean"
L got 'em cornered, bitch, why you speak like that?
Tattoed Def Jam under your wing like that
What? You a rider, not in my house, Mouth
Glad to escape down south to my Miami house
And fifty spring in the couch

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
Let's play a game of big bank take little bank (Yeah)
Big dank take little dank (Yeah)
I average ninety-five in the paint (C'mon)
We comin' down like a shank
I know you wanna ride, but you can't
We all up in your shit like a shank *ugh*
Don't make me stop and pull brakes
Ya two downs are lookin cool, freakin a sound
Yo, I get fucked up and terroize the town
I'm the circus ring master so fuck the clowns
I bust, lyrics and rounds at the Lyricist Lounge
Lost and Found a new identity, from here to infinity (Yeah)
God have mercy on all my enemies
Don't even test, waist your breath or your energy
Knock ya whole family off, like the Kennedy's
I'm pledge sicker than age, with no type of remedy
Makin' niggas retire but reclaim disability
Agility, keppin' y'all outta the state penitentiary

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Look, nigga I, regulate, bake the cake
Shake the fake, while keepin my faith (Uh-huh)
Demonstatin' from the funk shit to the H
I bring the bread to the meat, so put the funk on the plate
You weedin' at my table, did you say your grace? (Huh)
You say the wrong thing and I'mma smack your face (Bee-atch)
Chase these niggas or waste these niggas (Say what)
You did fucked up cuz I'm break these niggas
Spray them, liquidate 'em, fade 'em all
Suckers, I hate 'em, laws I pay them off
Big Dogg, in this motherfuckin' bar
Wit Uncle L, don't tell Baby Dogg, "Yes y'all"
We do this with no flaws
I love my bitch wit no drawers and no bras
No laws, we break 'em from the get-go
Slidin' by, ridin high when we get-go
Love it or leave it, we love livin illegal
Servin' or swervin in a '85 Regal
Look here, bitch, you ain't a motherfuckin' Beagel
I take off on your ass like an eagle
Wherever we go, we stay connected with my peoples
Just incase a motherfucker wanna G Funk
Two of the homies, and one of 'em got a piece on
And they never hesitate to dissolve[Intro: 40 Glocc]
Light up that marijuana
Pass me the bong
Fill up my cup
Fill it up with Patron
Suuuun

[Verse 1: Sun]
We just came to party
And I'm feelin' good
I got the Remy for any women that's feeling loose
Your man grillin' and he just up on my tennis shoes
I think we met, we gettin' checks like (???)
You see her shinin' with diamonds, glass, a swimmin' pool
All the women drool, when they see the linen jewels
The way you drifted by, it really got me in the mood
Take me to the room and blow me up like a inner clue

[Verse 2: Village Boo]
I just came to party
Pulled up

Valet park

TipToe)

And I'm tryin' to leave tonight, with at least three freaks
Hit the room, you know, until I skeet, skeet
I hope these clowns in here ain't tryin' to start beef
Cause that'll be the reason that niggas kickin' your front teeth

[Hook: Eminem]
We just came to party

Cup, and spilt it on me
Now, he's startin' on some
Shit, this with the naughty
He's about to get the
Shit, kicked, (???) out of him

[Verse 2: TipToe]
I don't got no time for these niggas that's playing games
I don't take it as a diss unless you sayin' my name
I'm a bad influence, I smoke weed in front of kids
I crack a bottle open and ask 'em
If they wanna swig
I'm the bad guy that touched your wife
TipToe ain't nothin' nice
I rob Benz's and still sport a gang of ice
We gettin' money, we ain't trippin' off you ho niggas
Cause if we want you, we'll come show up at your show, niggas

[Verse 3 Jayo Felony]
He 'bout to get the
Shit kicked the fucked out of 'em

Head for the pushin' and shovin' 'em
So crazy

Just sayin'
Hit a stick that get a guerilla pissin' me with that is Crip

Never sound like an amateur, I damage niggas' brains
This buster
Came to be a party pooper, I'm insane

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Niqle]
Got a couple of handguns, feel like my block is ready
And I'm livin' it Thug Life, like I was Makaveli and
Nigga, this Zoo Life, nigga, I ride for it

I done flip the whole brick
I'm flippin' this cocaine
Got socas in line, dancin' like it's Soul Train

[Verse 5: 40 Glocc]
The party don't pop off, unless we pop up in it
If the drama jump off, the first to dive up in it
Infamous/G-Unit it, baby, Shady, Aftermath
I done started my own shit, Zoo Life about to crack
Bloods and Crips, they love me (I get my point across)
Bang on the nigga that's phony ((???) sauce)
Pick up the phone with the police
And he was tryin' to kick it, but nigga's got cold feet
YAH!

[Verse 1: Jayo Felony]
I can give it to ya but whatcha gonna do wit it
When I'm in Texas I'm bumpin' screw music
With Big Mike and Scarface with Luke Loop
Me and lil' Crook like Bo and Luke Duke
When I'm in Miami I go to scoop Luke
To see the peep show and hit some duke shoot
Went to Branson, back to back, Lex Coupe
Up in "Harlem World" in my Timb boots
Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot
Called up Benny Rat, copped a bullet proof
Seen T-Funk he took us to the fruit
Then he went to the Tunnel and brought down the roof
Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin' sweat
Slang a cassette to Funkmaster Flex
And now I'm bumpin' on East Coast tapedecks
Went from Swatch to platinum Rolex
S.D., Jersey we getting more sex, flow next, go next

[Hook]

[Hook]
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low ridahh (2x)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
If my niggas can't eat then y'all niggas can't sleep
I just begun to creep, Nightmares on Elm Street
Release from Jones Beach to South Beach, capisce?
Kickin' dust as I bust, fuck peace
And all them crooked cops on the beat
My niggas bring the funk like your Grandpa feet
'Til death do us part, save my bullets for the charts
With darts, like HBO watching after dark
No love for a mark, even less for a trick
That wanna be like Mike, Mike who? My dick
Real shit Hot Nicks
Run wit my niggas that ain't got shit
Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit
One time, out for mine, but can't stop it
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic
Leave the crime scene spotless
Mix the green with the chocolate, here's the topic
Niggas, synchronize your watches
We goin in, wit nothin' but a Clan logo
Mr. meth, (DMX!) I'm running loco motherfucker

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
I got a wicked flow and I'm gonna kick it yo, feel the pressure
Snatching niggas up just like change off the dresser
Niggas hit me with they best shit, then what
I shake that bullshit off *arf arf arf* then go nuts
Ive been down too long, can't a motherfucker show me nothing
Y'all bitch niggas is duckin' me like you owe me something
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say
I couldn't talk you wouldn't walk my way on your best day
The best way you can hope to get close to me
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be
The first time you start acting fuckin' strange
Best to be ducking range
Talkin' shit wearing a fuckin' chain
I break niggas like promises
Split em' open like Thomas's
And sell more drugs than a pharmacist
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime
Attitude that doesn't mind doing time

[Hook]

[Hook][Intro: Cold 187Um]
This is an escalation, merging every corner of your mind
I'm with the twist of a rhyme, we outlast time
We got Km.G in the house
DJ K-Oss in the house
Jayo Felony in the house
I must spit

[Verse 1: Cold 187Um]
Welcome to the tilt that the Tru's built
We on gold whips, with them killer lifts
Look here, tre swinging rag-top
Boy you didn't know we was some legends like Sasquatch?
Dot your I's, cross your T's, when you see these G's
We stand tall like them California palm trees
And everything is fine, when I roll
Cause I flips never slips sipping X.O...

[Verse 2: Km.G]
I X.O. before I sex-o, a pimp clinic ritual
Chips for the stacking, hoes wanna know what's cracking
I'm in, tell them they ain't coming through with that love potion
Ask me what I'm quoting, wondering, what I'm smoking
The bomb, more scarier than that shit her-on
Sweat out your bitch 'do fresh from the salon
I can't give it up, I love my leather and chrome
And my 20 inch rims, grin nigga, I'm gone yeah.....

[Hook: Cold 187Um and Km.G]
So now we got you hooked on X.O
So high the homegirls can't let go
See the homies still fading that X.O
Worldwide, Above The Law getting faded on another level
So now we got you hooked on X.O
So high the homeboys can't let go
See the homies still fading that X.O
What "X.O." What "X.O."

[Verse 3: Jayo Felony]
Like I was born to be homicidal, so I let my Glock spit
Motherfuckers don't wanna see this California shit
Who you can't go the mile so you ganked my penitentiary style
That I kicked since a juvenile
Niggas who be foul get touched
Kicking this shit with Km.G and Hutch
Then I roll through your hood and blast such and such
More than your whole click with what I'm holding
Patrolling the block I'm from
If one gun aiming up, then 40 Glock'll come
Rock your son then I pop you one
Ugh, you done, kill a bitch in the sun
I ain't the one mothafucker
Like walking across a tiger, in a pork chop bikini nigga
You gon' get ate up, so you don't wan' see me
It'll be me and a chick so if I steps in a three piece
It's D-O-G-C and he'll see deceased
I hold more alcohol than a liquor store
For sure, clown these hoes at a show
And for sure we X.O....

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Km.G]
Oh for sheezy nigga, I stay Eazy like E
I got hoes making sounds like Master P "Ugh"
I got homies with the bomb and we still on the run
Yeah, hooker hit the grind and it's tossing time
See I asked me homey Jayo what's the price on the yayo
Yeah right, they next to Mexico, the homey from Diego
Get the plug on the drop, hop
Then my niggas hit the club
Bring five of them back to kick it in the hot-tub..

[Verse 5: Cold 187Um]
We got the hook up from here to Okinawe
New and improved like the C-4 Volvo "yeah, yeah"
And remember one thing when you in my zone
Is that I still break a bitch conversating on a chipped phone
Cause I'm amazing like the great Houdini "ooohh weee"
And I be fly like that hit of ya Remi
Who wanna be me
I wanna see me when I'm on the grind
Cause I be straight hitting corners, X.O.'ing in the sunshine...

[Hook]

[Hook: X6]
Km.G: See I can't lose, with the shit that I use
187Um: So everybody, X.O. Wit Me

[Outro: Street Dialogue]
Goddizamn, who's that knockin down the blizock like that homies
Oh that's the homies K-Oss, Hutch, Km.G
What's up my niggas, what's up man
What's up homey, trip, trip, trip (*Car Parked*)
Damn I'm trying to come up on some weed for the party
Oh they got you down the street

Lafayette down the street
Not the Lafayette that I got into it at the club last week?
They got that pure

It's that crip nigga, quick hit em with my dick
Spit with a big shit, kick a nigga
Get wit a nigga quick shit
Bitch, now can you picture me jokin?
I bang 47th street, bitch I keep it loccin
And all around the world, I leave my enemies broken
Like toot, toot, toot, you hear their families hopin
With tooooot, death is all I got to give
I said my name is One Shot Kill not One Shot Live
And all ya muthafuckas got to go

Hit a muthafucka with a gangsta flow
?? prank to though
Have you ever shot a nigga befo'? No!
Have you ever killed a nigga befo'? No!
And I'ma take yo lil ass to the movies to ??  Part 4
I flip four cases of noodles on moral
And nobody had to give me shit when I was in Paso
G might kick a nigga in, even though he was from the Brimms
Now I'm rolling with triple gold rims, eatin shit and Eminems/M&Ms

[Hook](2x)
You's a muthafuckin character I buried ya
Knew you was scared, nigga scary us

Fashion gangbangas with the part but can't play the role
When it's all said and done I'ma be left with these streets in my soul

[Jayo Felony]
Which one of ya'll tricks wanna test this?
Young, dumb and I'm restless
You hide from me when you throw parties and never make ya guest list
You's a character you fake gangbangin clown
And the homies and cuz's would tear this muthafucka down, RIGHT NOW!
Now, my khakis always fit me
Don't want no funk, you scared to squabble with me
I'm the hardest on dry land and even you see that
Catch him with 11 thou on the +Baby Boy+ movie set
I approached like "We need to holla" and he tucked his tail
Cus this bitch lanky nigga knew he can't fuck with Fel
Ya see even you know what type a nigga you was facin
Tryin to leave and hurry up and get to the next location
Tryin to jump me but I knew to grab his cold ass nigga
A 40s cuz? I'ma about to meatball that nigga
Beg me to sign to ya label, nigga but keep tryin though
Had his perm fucked leanin to the side like Lionel

[Hook](2x)

Nickname Bullet Loc
Your 8-ball junkie
Bass drum kickin' to show my shit
Rockin', holdin' my dick
Boy

Crowd rockin' muthafucka from around the way
I got a six-shooter, yo, mean I'm brave
Rollin' through the hood
To find the boys
Kick dust and cuss, crank up some noise
Police on my drawers
I have to pause
40 Ounce's in my lap and it's freezin' my balls
Hook a right turn, let the boys go past
Then I say to myself: "They can kiss my ass!"
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass on high on
Cruisin' through the East Side, South ??
Seen the bitch ass
Then I say word
Took a look at the face and the bitch was street curb
Ho's on my dick for the title I'm holdin'
Bullet Loc fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin

In the cityyyyy --] Ronnie Hudson's West Coast Pop Lock
Kick that shit --] Flavor Flav

Ridin' on ??? weed is on ???
Turned down the sound
And ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause old bitch almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off, put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tilt cause I was drunk
See an enemy on mine, had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all ?? cause
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the heat
And like a mirage
A busta like that got out of dodge
Sucker's on me cause the title I'm holdin'
Bullet Loc's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin'

In the cityyyyy --] Ronnie Hudson's West Coast Pop Lock
Kick that shit --] Flavor Flav

Olde English 800 cause that's my brand
Take it in a bottle, 40, quart or can
Drink it like a madman, yes I do
Fuck the police and the 5.0 too
Stepped in the party, I was drunk as hell
3 bitches already said: "Ohh Bullet your breath smells!"
40 ounce in hand
That's what I got
(Yo, you see Bullet earlin' in the parkin lot?)
Stepped on your foot, cold dissed your ho'
Asked her to dance and she said: "Hell no!"
Called her a bitch cause that's the rule
(Bitch, who d'you callin' a bitch?)
Boyz in the hood tryin' to keep me cool
Tell your homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get 'em up
I start droppin' the dogs
And watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum, got knocked out cold
(Ah aha, made you look sick you snotty nosed prick
Now your fly bitch is all over his dick)
Punk got dropped cause the title I'm holdin'

Get chipped up, fresh out the gate - yea we strive for that
Homie wanted it bad enough so he died for that
I'mma follow my dreams like never before, knah'mean
They givin out time like trick-or-treat candy
And every day is Halloween
And that one time, ay Lo why the call it 'one time'
Cuz it only takes one time to get yo' ass behind
Them iron bars, I used to steal cars
Never wheel cars all around that D
Gleam gleamin on the scantlous hoes - beware of the cuthroats
Mad cuz kids be pointin to my mami that's bullet loc'ed
God told me "Go study the ants", I'mma work like 'em
Never pass emcees, give them dust like dirtbike 'em
And in the process of that, I progress with that
I know to get out here and get my scratch
Break the door down for my loved ones, you know who you are
And I'mma leave the bank open like ahhhhhh!

[Ras Kass]
When I die bury me butt-naked and face down in the grass
So I can fuck the world while y'all kiss my ass
Like that faggot - crawlin out this bitch like a 6 foot maggot
For the lust of livin lavish
I rhyme in a cocoon so nobody can find me
And that rapper who dick you ridin, ten years behind me
Motivation switched from freestyle to buy me
Nigga gotta twist this paper like oragami

[Hook - Jayo Felony]
I'm in the business of Bentley's and bitches, and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on them schemers, when I dip
In the business of Bentley's and bitches, and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on them schemers, when I dip

[Jayo Felony]
In this cold-hearted world, nobody give a damn about you
When your on a mission to come up, they wanna knock it out ya
But as soon as you break the ice you gone see how they fake it
"That's my dawg right there, damn, I knew he was gone make it"
Ha yea right, I done heard it all, your full of yourself
When I needed your full support, where the hell was the help?
You was nowhere in sight, but I flooded the airways
You thinkin about plottin, huh, I'm thinkin about diggin ya grave
You wanna hurt me huh, wanna do it real bad huh?
Cuz I kick it with Cash Money, that's makin you mad huh?
But I worked to hard for this, you know the game gets stressful
But I know my biggest revenge is to keep being successful
You instigated, ya hater, who would have let you in?
Fool, just give me forty feet cuz you know what I'm doin

[Hook]

[Ras Kass]
I spit from the genitals bitch, leave mascaline stinch
Got niggas panickin petrol, make a manakin flinch
Grew up botanical inch - the root of all evil
Green thump for greenbacks, rented a tech
But we can't all eat though (Why?)
Cuz y'all fecal, we brawl lethal
Homicide dick absorber, Fairfax and Pico
Suga, nobody's ever equal
Cuz the more we make, the more we're takin from other people
Pimpin for the repo - pent up in LAX to JFK
Abide this claim with three ho, like Santa say (ho ho ho)
My third eye be the equivalent of the algebraic pi
So if I give you a piece of my mind; it's multiplied times infini
Spiritually elevate so high, I commit driveby's while I skydive
Sip of my time, perform shit only concieved in sci-fi
So why try an test?
It's boom-bop-bop, Mr. Ice-Grill guy
You must be lookin somewhere else like Biggie Smalls' lazy eye
Ha, sicker than your average
Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome infectin faggots

Bitch, bitch, bitch...{Xzibit}
Mi casa es su casa
Mi raza es su raza

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Kid Frost

This is big business, understand me?
Yeah, you can't take no for a answer

Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made
You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades
We're playin catch with a hand grenade
Cause what you faggot niggas caught
Spread you all over the asphalt
Walk the walk, talk to nobody
Spark the chrome shotie
Whenever they run up on your home, Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it
Xzibit get your whole shit crowded
And packed to capacity
You actually had the audacity
To want some problems with the X Man
Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand
Learn one of life's hard lessons
You can't negotiate with a weapon
When it's fully loaded and cocked
Hollow points shot
Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop
I took you off, so accept the loss
Crack open some Olde English that's covered with frost
And it's like that

[ Chorus ]
	Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
	For this is the season for stackin the papers

	Chasin my chips till my last days
	Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

{Frost}
I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces
Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases
Please understand automatically
One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy
Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me
My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically
Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me
50/50 - half gangster, half hustler
One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka
So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like Swiss-made
Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade
Razor, got the H-K with the laser
Slid the Enterpriser, rent a 99 black Blazer
I shot straight at Merino
Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the Peppermint Casino
I been a player before I had riches
And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches

[ Chorus ]

{Jayo Felony}
I don't give a fuck about not one of y'all
Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin y'all
When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite
I take flight like Delta, nigga, helter skelter
Who the fuck could you call to help ya
Nigga, good health couldn't help ya
Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya
Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off
Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off
But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off
Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher
Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit
Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit
Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic
Static, what's that? That shit that get up in my fabric
I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch

[ Chorus ][ VERSE 1: Jayo Felony ]
12 noon in the hood, Hennessy on the rocks, that is my potion
Bitches singin that sad love song like Billy Ocean
But to them hoochie hoodrats (I) give em no leeway
So now I'm peelin out hittin switches on a freeway
Leanin to the side (right) bouncin when I hit a dip
Slowin down so my CD won't skip
When trip I'm pullin up on all-gold D's
The orange bud is sticky, crack a forty with the O.G.'s
And it was cool until they put me up on the scoop:
"Yo Loc, I saw your main bitch in a coupe
Whooptie-whoop and they were goin to the mo-mo"
So I'm thinkin: Oh no, it's time to roll to the pad and get my .44
No ho is worth another case, get out my face
As I bring it to the table like grace
Bitch, and I want nothin else to do with you
Speed on, hurry up and get gone because I'm through with you

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

[ VERSE 2: Jayo Felony ]
Not givin a damn about a punk bitch, it's all about the sex, man
Cause if the Loc take a fizzall you're goin to the next man
Prraw, prraw, prraw, that's how my toolie sound
When I pullin off on her
Cause I don't want her
You know what I'm sayin?
I wasn't born with that bitch
And I ain't gon die with that bitch
And I tell that bitch to split quick
And prraw sounds I make out the pipes on my muthafuckin 64
But let me get back on this bitch, though
My O.G.'s raised me to never ever let them hoes plays me
I pray that you save me, they pushin up daisies
Cause if I caught you in bed with Ted and Fred
That still wouldn't make me put no strap to my head
Bullet Loc stayin tall, though, through it all, though
Some of y'all ain't good for nothin but a bootie call, though
Yo, so I'm off in the wind and stayin true
Speed on, hurry up and get gone because I'm through with you

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

(Prraw prraw prraw, that's how my toolie sound)
When I'm pullin off on those bitches
Cause your game ain't tight

(Prraw prraw prraw, that's how my toolie sound)
When I'm pullin off on those bitches
Cause your game ain't tight

[ VERSE 3: Jayo Felony ]
There's a pijama party goin down...
Fool, you should know that I'm with that
The baddest hoes in the world want the Bullet Loc to hit that
I'm on the prowl, I'll be the one gettin my stroke on
I never hesitates to get my loc on
Ugh, get my smoke on ,but you know that's only right, though
The po-po wanna know why my eyes low
But I got a surprise, though
Pedal to the flo', that's how I peel out
Drink won't spill out, chill out and let my crop sprout
I'm out it's on ( ? ) takin it easy
Bitch, don't try to hide when you see me
Your game is wack, so stay the fuck back
I drop you off at the bus stop to give that horse his tail back
You been dismissed, dissed like snotty tissue
Get outta here, disappear bitch, but I won't miss you
And they all know what a real gee'll do with you
Straight give the boot to that ass because I'm through with you

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

(Prraw prraw prraw, that's how my toolie sound)
When I'm pullin off on a bitch
Cause your game ain't tight

(Prraw prraw prraw, that's how my toolie sound)
When I'm pullin off on those bitches
Cause your game ain't tight
