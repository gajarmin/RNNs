If Big Squad was here, he'll be off a hitter

You ain't know shit though man, just keep eyes to yourself nigga
Watch your step
Bad bitches to the right, weak bitches to the left
Like I said man we here to party

Do your thing just don't step on these all white G Fazos
Gang! Turn up

[Hook:]

I'm bustin', I'm bustin', im bustin this bus somebody pass me a water or something

Now everywhere I go, I'm with my niggas
Everywhere I go, I let my chain swang
You a fuck nigga, stay in your lane
This ain't nothin' to us cause we gang bang

[Verse 1:]
Herbo steppin' out, everything designer
Off of Louie V, drinkin' Fiji water
Belt Louie V, sag my Truey jeans
Hit the club deep and we off them yoppas
All my niggas fly, we came for the bitches
But don't get it twisted, we still for the drama
Pop a lot of bottles, all my niggas with me
The ones you don't see? Outside with them choppas
Back to what I said, we here for the hoes
All them bitches love me now
I'm gettin' money, I might pull up in a Rov
Came from nothin', I just had to let them know
So don't mix me up in this rap shit
I don't rap beef, get you wrapped quick
I be in the streets, every nigga know me
If you lookin' for me, you can get to me
150 with me, my shooters with me
All they know is kill, show no sympathy
And they kill for free, don't get killed for me
Lil bro got it on him off a pill or three
We don't show ID, couple shorties with me
Tottin' thirty clips only sixteen
Fly my bros out, buy some new poles
Spend a few cheese, that's a sixteen

[Pre-Hook:]
And who this nigga approachin'? Don't know him
If he do somethin' put infrared on him
He make a move and you know we start blowin'
They rollin', they rollin', they rollin', they rollin'
Bitch in my section and I know she on me
After I stroke her, leave her pussy soakin'
Suck me up then and we gone fuck til the mornin'
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', we rollin'

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
This ain't nothin' to us cause we (gang bang)
So don't fuck with us if you don't (gang bang)
My momma ask me why I gotta (gang bang)
Cause I can't make no money and still (gang bang)
But for my dead homies gotta (gang bang)
Cause I know they was on the same thang
Ridin' focus, I can't even change lanes
Forgiatos, fully autos, bang bang
This one's for my niggas
I woulda said it was for the bitches but I dont got shit for the bitches
Shame all on you niggas all on the Instagram stuntin' for them bitches
Frontin' under pictures
And you can catch me over east my nigga
Don't like talkin' under pictures
If he was a threat, we'll get on that left by where he living
All I know is hustle, move it by the muscle
I won't move a muscle have my shooters touch you
I got nina with me, I know she don't trust you
Nina nice and little but she still'll fuck you
Glizzy's with the drums, play with them for fun
Got so many guns I don't know which one
Tahoes in them chops, ridin' flippin' blocks
If we see the opps make some windows drop

[Pre-Hook + Hook + Bridge:][Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
These rappers is actors, they life is in scenes (Cut, cut, cut)
You catch me in traffic, got pipes with the beams
Got so many clips that I could make a movie
Herb got the Uzi up under the Coogi
Them niggas with you they look like some goofys
Gon try to rob me, you gon have to shoot me

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Nigga tryna rob me? That will never happen
Keep my Smith & Wesson
Hollows to his chest some one call a reverend
Taught that boy a lesson, here come 911
Step right over here check him if you ain't check him
Four nickles jam, damn he caught a blessing
Better not come through flexing all my niggas reckless
If you looking for us, just pull up on Essex

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
I trap on the corner no matter the weather
A stack for the sweater, I trap in Margielas
Shooters they with me they pack a Baretta
She let me fuck from the back when I met her
That .357 will send you to heaven
These niggas is tellin my niggas is felons
My bitches dyking like they name was Ellen
Laughing at niggas like they name was Kevin

[Verse 4: Lil Herb]
Aye, codeine what I'm sipping,  gas what I'm inhaling
Posto what you smelling
Rollin up dutches in the living room got my momma yelling
Chill out, why you trippin, fuckin up my session?
Here a couple 100's go watch channel 7
Momma knew I was the man since I was 7
Therefore she don't give a damn about the present

[Verse 5: Lil Bibby]
I hop on the track, you could see what I'm spitting
You niggas wouldn't believe how I'm living
I don't think they could take the heat in the kitchen
I pray my young niggas get freed out the prison
My block is hot, the police is tripping
My niggas savage, don't need a religion
I see niggas oppin then I'm going shopping
I pop out the cut then I'm squeezing and dipping

[Verse 6: Lil Herb]
Hah, and we call that completing the mission
You know everywhere we go got like 2 or 3 poles
Shoot the bitches if you look suspicous

[Verse 7: Lil Bibby]
Play with me, you gon sleep with the fishes
No them killers don't shoot from a distance
And them niggas ain't leaving no witness
Eat up tracks man this beat was delicious

[Hook: Both]
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
Niggas is cappin, they say that they savage
But I ain't heard nothin bout you
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
They say that they trappin, they claim that they got it
But I ain't heard nothin bout you

[Verse 8: Lil Herb]
Before me and Bibby had verses and show money pilling
We were just young niggas wyling
Even though I be rapping about murders and violence
When the police come, I'm silent
Louie V on my shirt, Gabana my shades
Versace my belt, I be stylin
Your bitch says she in love with my "Hot Nigga" verse
Now she sucking my dick from freestyling

[Verse 9: Lil Bibby]
I'm still puttin on for my city
Fuck niggas rapping like Bibby
Still ride around with my glizzy

They kill in Chiraq like it's legal
Pop out shoot shit up like a needle
Try to take my chain, I ain't going
Shoot him in his brain, I ain't know it
Take a nigga chain then wear it
Pass it to the gang now we sharing
Turn a goofball to a spirit
Bullet turn a nigga to a bitch
Hit, screaming like a bitch
You a goofy got hit on the hip
I'm thumbing through a check, running up a bag
Since you can't get no money get a ?
You can't get no ride bitch call a cab
I be mixing drugs like a lab[Intro: Lil Herb & Lil Bibby]
Time to let these niggas know what it is in the streets
Aye Bibby, let's kill shit broski. Whatchu wanna do?
It's whatever man, just go on ahead and rip that shit
Ima come around and clean that shit up
Lets get it

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty I'm really wit' it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it
Lil Bibby on the track with me
One mistake and he clap fifty
When I hit the scene hoes go insane
Cause they know a nigga got them racks wit' me
No velcro but the strap wit' me
Let a nigga wanna act silly
I'mma let it off and then leave him there
Ride off and don't even care
Bitch I cash out 'till I pass out
Got a couple trues I don't even wear
In the game bitch I do my thang
Hoes scream my name I ain't even there
Lil Herb boy I does this
Leave your bitch wetter than a pool pit
And I make bands like I make friends
Bought some ray-bans on some cool shit
But now it's back to some killa shit
Got some wild hoes that'll drill a bitch
Yea it's no limit, thirty years runnin'
Thirty years gunnin' and we still the shit
I never run cause I stay to fight
I'll cook a nigga like steak and rice
And it's hella real in the battlefield
Gangbang gotta pay the price
Hit a nigga with the forty fifth
Bet it make his ass do forty flips
M-O-B I don't love a ho
Imma be this way 'til I'm forty six
Matter of fact 'til a nigga die
Smoke kush blunts 'til a nigga cry
And I never feed off another man
Cause I understand how a nigga lie
Never snitch on a nigga dry
Yeah that's how a nigga die
Got a yellow bitch in the passenger
She gon' suck and fuck if I get her high
If I do the dash then my whip will fly
Foreign shit what a nigga ride
I ain't never snoozin' let a nigga try
Got the nine ruger on a nigga side

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Lil Bibby, no limit yea I'm all about that sack bitch
My young niggas they clap shit

And Y'all know what snitches get, No limit shit
We wit' the shits, I'm focused on gettin' rich
M-O-B forget a bitch, right after I hit the bitch
Like point me to the kitchen bitch, I be water whippin' shit
Whip it, Jeff Gordon whip it, hit it wit' the fork
Straight drop no shorts
Shooters on and off the court, shoot a nigga off his porch
Turn a nigga to a corpse, yeah, I'm bout that
Rollin' up that loud pack
Catch me lackin'? I doubt that, cause I never leave without that
And that's real shit, got real hitters they kill shit
You fuck around hit the kill switch, these hollow tips you feel this
And I'm tryna get real rich
Cause my mama said I wouldn't be shit
Nobody never gave me shit
Like "Bibby hop on this remix", that's five hundred, no free shit

I got thirty off in that Glock, have my nina give you top
Bodies gon' drop and we ain't gon' stop

He telling and he hiding, but real niggas still catch a nigga
Cop Raris, I don't test drive 'em, home theaters, can't Best Buy 'em

Broke bitches that talk shit, now them the bitches I stunt for
Malcolm X daughter came at me, lookin' ass niggas ain't happy
Rolled out with some Latin Kings and some eses in 'em plain khakis
Smack bitches, no smack cam, closed fists, no back hands
Pop pussy on a hand stand, they suckin' dick like it's band camp
Call Webb and then call Nitty, Queens niggas in it's all hoodies

Smoke a lot a of weed like fuck kidneys, put a dutch in me
Got a 40 on me, I don't trust any
And if any nigga ever try to end me
I'ma die shooting, prayin' God forgive me
You too busy hating, you can't get no paper, why are y'all so silly?
Straight killers I can call so many, I don't love no bitches
But my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki
I'm in Hollywood came from Kingston Food
Shorties standing, in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang we don't say no names
If you talk to cops I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Puttin' my relations in your conversations
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation
You get my position then you better take it
Know some young bulls from a while back
Tryna leave the game but they never made it
I got old shit, killin' your shit, on a couple tracks I just never played it
Pussy nigga you don't want war, I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
Pussy nigga you don't want war, I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis

Best thing to do is get your cake and bounce
Word around town, bucks made it now
But I'mma go hard til they take me out
And I'm ridin' with the goons cause the goons gone shoot
Thick white Shawn  don't want a new coupe
If a nigga was a threat then that boy'll be through
Twenty on his head, what the fuck he gone do?
I ain't duckin' no action, I ain't just rappin'
Young niggas clap, we can make it happen
Learned mathematics, fuck with crack addicts
Was gone for a minute now a nigga back at it
I kill for the dough, still kick it though
Still got smoke and it still for the low
In the field with the shit, I'm still with the shit
Niggas know Bibby, I'm as real as it get

[Interlude]
Hold up

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I'm from a city where they forever hate
Young nigga wanna see better days
Lotta nights I coulda seen Heaven gates
God stay with me but I never pray
I keep my gun on me, I ain't never safe
And I'mma let it spray naw I won't hesitate
And Mills with the steel cause it's real in the field
Bitch it's kill or be killed, I don't live a better way
Without a doubt I go hard for my niggas
Roc Block, Kobe Squad them my niggas
And yea I got an open heart for my niggas
But still gotta keep a Glock for my niggas
Can't stop me once we squad up, with my niggas
Gettin' money, fuckin' stars is my niggas

Then I might have to depart from my niggas

[Interlude]
Look it's like what's best for everybody else ain't always whats best for you my man. Can't hand feed no sharks nigga. Still Never Leave My Brothers though

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby + Lil Herb]
Young nigga so sick, need a check up
On the road, people tryna run they check up
Gettin' money, all these hoes wanna sex us
Nigga out of town, still throwin' sets up
Lose your head before I leave it on the curb
This real talk, it's not just some words
Niggas sneak dissin'? Man that nigga got nerves
A call to the city, gotta check up on my nigga Herb like
What up bucks? What up bro?I'm ridin' on east with it on me
I still gotta look to my left and my right
Niggas want me to sleep by my lonely
I'm riding and smoking and thinking
I'm only 19 but feel like a grown-up
Look at the mess that we madeAll these other MCs tryna clone us
Ain't that a bitch
And my face on my dick
Big face on my wrist should be makin' 'em sick
Start hatin' and shit
Man I think they just wanna see a nigga trip
Then I had a thought right when I was about to flip
Gotta calm down, let me hear my nigga TIP likeIntro(Lets get it! Fazo Land Roc Bloc L's)

Verse 1 (Lil Herb)
I remember growing up tryin get it
Gotta eat by any means, for that green I was with it
But I had to humble down I learned
Money come around now I'm tryin to raid the town
So my clips scrape the ground
If I'm riding round ima get that
Petty stains i ain't with that
Never fed in to the chit chat
Cause these fuck niggas they'll act hard til the mac spark
Leave em flatlined in the backyard thats a quick hit
Scratch the hit list
My lil niggas gone flip shit
Don't tolerate no bitch shit
Mossbergs that's 6'6 better duck from the bucks
Buck after buck, 1 leave em stuck 2 leave em slumped Throw the pumps in the trunk
Knuck if you want if he jump he a chump
Better watch how he move if he clutch he'll dump
I ain't worried bout em, I ain't taking no L's
Only heard about em cause the old heads told stories about em
And Rel just told me, Herb man fuck em up
And that's what ima do, so if you riding, man buckle up
You know its goin down, so the guys gone knuckle up
We booming on the work, so on the first they come and fuck with us
They know we got that drop, yall rocks playing double dutch
Stepped on concrete, washed out like laundry
Pharrow in the cut Dooski twisting up the blunt
And Remo in the garage and grab the ozz so we can stunt
I be getting money, keep it coming, new joints on my feet for nothing
Bitches always staring at me, trying to get a piece of something
And they can't get a piece of shit, still i make them eat the dick
I'll never be a stain, and I'm always Fazo Land so ill never be a lame
Niggas playing hard to kill, That'll never be a game cause if we catch you we doing you
Farewells at funerals, hollow tips get to chewing you
Let him see the light
Ain't no time to revive he gone rest in peace tonight
Make him fight for his life
Pussy nigga should have never brought a knife to the fight
Tell his moms her baby boy lost his life to a pipe
Thats gone break her whole heart
Have her all on the news like my bae was so smart, he should have took another route
Then she tried to testify, so we took the mother out
Bitch we grimy on the 9, we get reckless on the 8
We the reason why they got all them detectives on the 8
But we ain't snitching, so we safe
No face, no case, The rats get the whole thang
Cops snatch me up, I don't know shit but my whole name
Sweep off the 8, blow one and back to the dope game
Flip a ounce and cop a drop top whiter than cocaine
With my doe up, the strip gone blow up like propane
If we deep in the streets, we taking up both lanes
John walking with the thang
He shooting like D Gaines
Don't get it brought to your front door
Jamal on Muskegan posted up like Mutombo
Thrax packs for the low, them 7's go for the honcho
If he short, he in debt


He don't pay and leave em wet
Overtime in the trap, im tryin make this nina stretch
If you front us for a dime, put some ether in his neck
Maintenace man hate the block, cause we always leave a mess
And they call us hotboyz, but we always leave em wet
And the ops don't come outside cause they always need a vest
I'm on the Ave. all night, so i always needa rest
I got a couple of keys to stretch
So my trap on D's and F's
My niggas on they P's and Q's out here wilding squeezing Tecs
And my bitches fiend for sex cause i leave em steaming wet

R.I.P. them niggas
Welcome to Fazoland coming soon
Just be patient
I know that's what ya'll been waiting for

Let's Get It!
Free them niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
Look I wake up every morning with the same state of mind
Bitch I'm running to this money
Let the lames wait in line
I'm impatient
Bitch I'm chasing
This first place and we not racing
Now I'm cashing
Riding Astons
Went from sitting in the station
But I'm up now

All the neighborhood hoes wanna fuck now
I can't let chain me up like a chump now
I just call my lil bros let her bustdown
See Jackie at the top when you touch down
I done lost alotta niggas to this street shit
Had to duck alotta triggers to this street shit
I done seen alotta niggas do this street shit
But the streets talk when you in deep shit

Taught me get rich cause you can't beat this
Gotta stay afloat niggas getting seasick
Gotta get the dough I ain't with the cheap shit
For everybody ever said I wouldn't be shit
Seen my homie hit twice coulda been three
Almost seen Christ twice coulda been three
I'mma burn these pipes 'fore they get me
I had to earn my stripes coulda went sweet

Now I separate from niggas I don't trust
Niggas that ain't starve with me
And all them bitches I ain't fuck
Cause I was working hard
Mixmatching words straight in that booth attaching verbs
Herb gon' get what he deserve and I deserve it all

Got some shit a couple labels heard
Now they want Herb to ball
Get me out the hood and in them hills
Man I done heard it all
But honestly my niggas honour me
Won't leave that hood at all
And honestly no nigga sponsored me
Me and my hood gon' ball

Responsibly I keep my promises
No need for compliments
I do as I please like the G's
Fuck the consequence
You boys ain't in my league
Got my speed or accomplishments
Might catch me overseas smoking weed eating Lobster tail

Or I'm probably over East where they pop you over beef
Dissing 'bout them L's boys until they spot you in the street
Now they got you in the streets
With nun' to block you from that heat
Ain't no boxing over East
My youngins pop before they speak

That's the way it go in my city
They trained to go in my city
We dream of sunny days
But it rain and snow in my city
Them things will blow in my city
Them boys be feeling anger
Can't just be hood on hood
Them boys be killing strangers

Everything ain't good all good
It ain't the same when your mans draw blood
Niggas change when the gang draw blood
When it's cold in the game
Niggas don't know your name
Have you posted on the block
Giving blows in the rain
16 toting Glocks thinking those are the things
Now you on top riding fours on a range
Everywhere niggas claim yall cuz

Nah it ain't all love where I meet you at
Niggas want Herb man that's why I keep a strap
Posted over East man where them heaters at
Run up on me bro let them heaters clap
And dear Lord I pray
That on the day when you take me away
I got enough money laid in the safe
To make sure my moms and my sister they straight

But the Lord coulda took me today
Let a nigga run up on me cook me today
It wouldn't be easy I stay with the Eight
Or I make one call have them K's in his face
Catch me in the mall spending K's on my waist
All I know is ball
And I do it harder than ya'll
In the club throwing racks got your broad off the wall
Off the Po' up leaning so hard I could fall

Codeine
Pour me up
Triple cups
Fours a night
Smoking dope
Sipping lean
Purple sprite
Hold the ice

Me and broski riding in that challenger high as fuck
Any nigga challenge us
Duck when we riding up

Buck at the nigga back
Buss till the nigga flat
One to his fitted cap
Watch how the nigga act

Skeet off
Drop the heat off
Call an ass to hit
Pick her up smash the bitch
V12 fast as shit

Dudeski call it Activist
I'm gon' off a six
I ain't lackin' while it's crackin'
Something long on my hip
Big pole nigga
You gotta be strong just to live
Quick soul lifter
This will get him gone in a jiff

Leave a nigga right there on the block where I'm at
Riding through kids and Marley in a lot with the Mac
Riding through trigger we gone leave you stinging from the black
Nigga lay a couple bricks on a mat
We on that
Apologies you don't want that
Run upon us with the chance you ain't blow that
Too bad man I feel for you
Say you eating man I hope your squad got a last meal for you

Catch a nigga in the store we blow him
Catch a nigga with his ho we blow him
Catch a nigga he don't got it we smoke him
Catch a nigga out in traffic we on him

Niggas think they want static do they really?
Ask me why I start rapping do they hear me?
But this shit ain't only rap cause it's in me
We ain't worried 'bout your stack we got 50's

Put No Limit on my back for the city
And No Limit's where it's at in the city
Right on Essex where I'm at come and get me
Right on Essex where I'm at come and get me

L's

Get More crack when my tape drop
Get More crack when my tape drop[Produced by Luca Vialli]

[Verse 1]
My hunger is equal to my struggle
I came from nothin'
Grindin' then I made it to somethin'
The age of a youngin'
Started hangin' and bangin' and hustlin'
Exchangin' the customs
To make it in this dangerous jungle
In a treacherous war
People dying, nobody crying
All the shit that I saw
You expect me to sit on the porch?
Every moment is yours
Freeze up and you fall by the torch where I'm from
Better not front in the city I'm from
Homicides on a Sunday in the city I'm from
Young nigga, always hanging wit them older guys
We was bangin', slangin' all the white
But we ain't Oberweis
Fantasizing, tryna be that trap nigga
Can't get to the money
We too busy tryna clap niggas
Standing on that block, where my mama told me
"Boy don't got right there"
But I was by that store right there
Learned everything I know right there
Me and broski, brought me to the block
He showed me the work, and he sold me the work
But nobody never told me to work
I used to post up, talk shit and tote guns
While we smoke blunts
We knew the price if we gon' live this life
But we like so what
Cause no one gon' make a way for none of us to come up
But I'm tryna make a way for every one of us to come up
When the sun rise I roll a philly up, and load the semi up
By 9 o'clock  I'm drinkin' double cups and gettin' paper cuts
We savin' up, sittin' on this money
Now it's raisin' us. We trained to buss
You can run dog, that's what this laser for
I think I need to, take a breather
Cause I'm hot as fever
I'm about to bring some type of demon
Right up outta me
Cause I been feelin' like you pussy niggas tryna plot on me
That's why I keep this Glock on me
Plus I got all this guap on me
But way before the flex you still could catch me
On that block out east
Lost my homies, now I feel like God just dropped a rock on me
But I won't stop, I can't stop
Gotta go hard, till my rate drop
Spittin' all this fire make my face hot
Now I can't wait till my tape drop
And I'm still up on the 8 Block
Late night me and J. Dot
Better think twice for you ride past
Let the 9 blast now the Jakes hot
I was bout to take a rest but
Smoke told me, "Bro it ain't no let ups"
So I'm working hard like I'm in the pros
Make a nigga bitch lick my sweat up
She suckin' dick and I just met her
She know a nigga next up
She hope I don't neglect her
And she know I don't respect her
And I might forget my sweater
But never leave the house without Berettas
Still the same nigga from the gangway
Tryna flip a ounce into a Phantom
Catch me doing shows filling stands up
You know the gang turn the fans up
And you know we got them cans tucked
Hope nobody don't get blammed up
I be leanin' I can't stand up
And this bitch asked me why my jeans sag
Cause they tryna hold my bands up
Heard somebody wanna rob me
Well you bett' not give ya chance up
2 seats in the 50 shot
I just hope I don't get jammed up
And this 50 bett' not jam up
I seen niggas get in jams and
They ain't even stay to pick they mans up
I seen niggas shakin' hands
Then make the same niggas put they hands up
I seen niggas changed gettin' change
Niggas that was cool since the sandbox
So I gotta keep my head up
16 and I got one head up
And ion talk, I let the gun talk
And she don't never really understand nothin'
Let a fuck nigga ask somethin'
Give a fuck nigga every one
Gave my young niggas couple .38s
And some shells let em have fun
Young niggas spend a lot of cash
Cause growing up I never had none
I'm like, "Oh I gotta get me some"
Cause being broke wasn't any fun
We got choppers for everyone
Who want problems with anyone
I be tired of tryna tell y'all niggas
Where a nigga really comin' from
And why a nigga gotta go hard
Cause ion really come from nothin'
And I never been a runner up
Cause it ain't nobody runnin' us
And Lil Mally got that sit em down
If somebody ever runnin' up
Imma always bond them killas out
What'chu think I got them hunnids for?
Crazy James just knocked his sentence out
Yeah the state done let a menace out
So I'm showing up at my nigga house
Like the cop that move the tenants out
I see lil niggas want some Twitter clout
But I ain't tryna put ya business out[Produced by DY of 808 Mafia]

[Intro]
I said I wasn't gonna do no more 4 Minutes Of Hell's, man
This gotta be it though, this the last one

[Verse]
I'm from the jungle, lions, apes and gorillas,  lions the police
Nigga we the apes and gorillas, go ape and gorilla
Boy, don't turn your face on a killer
Fuck the system, man, we going back to racism, nigga
Look, the department suffer fake-ism, nigga
Black police try not to notice, like they ain't killing niggas and hate killing niggas
Seen a million bodies, I done shed a thousand tears
Niggas just turn thousandaires, been selling rocks a thousand years
Two time felon nigga, one more like a thousand years
And the average pussy nigga out here ain't gone ride with his
He gon' switch up, he gon' fold, he ain't holdin' shit back
He only got a year back and now he can't forget that
You done sold your fucking soul for 400 days
Niggas got their kid starving for some fucking J's
Life too short, better not get caught up in your fucking ways
I be feeling like Phil Jackson, all these fucking plays
I'm just riding through my city, getting blazed, in the rain
I been stressing, feel like I'm a couple days from insane
Don't know what's got into me, I just been saving the pain
The devil tryna' enter me, I just might let him into me
But I know when he finna' leave that that's gon' be the end of me
And I won't let that finish me, cause I got too much energy
I be right back in effect like I just got a injury
Pourin' up that purple happiness, it give me energy
Sip your happiness, forget your problems; that's the remedy
Sippin' Activis straight out the bottle, shit's so good to me
I be leanin', I be smoking, poppin' beans then I be rollin'
Hop in steamers and we rollin, hop in Beamers and we rollin'
Pull up on your block with glizzies and them beams and we be blowin'
We ain't shooting for no reason, clear the scene when we blowin'
Then we high, in the sky, tellin' fo'nem 'bout the story
Got a lot of niggas gone that I been knowin' since we was shorties
That alone just made me stronger, got my chrome though I ain't worried, boy
Posted on that curb, boy, early off the syrup, boy
Chill, if you don't know me, give a fuck 'bout what you heard, boy
Niggas see me when I fly past like, "There go Herb, boy!"
Rappers wanna know the way that I play with the words, boy
33 up in the clip like I play with that Bird, boy
And niggas know that Lil Bibby my bro, got the shit for the low on the birds, boy
Real nigga shit, we ten year niggas, bitch, so imagine the numbers  for Herb, boy
And we go ham every month on the first, junky walk up and just empty her purse
Don’t work with feelings, my money come first
And no, I'm not a hypocrite so therefore, I don't got to a church
God still with me even though I'm out here doing my dirt
It's a lot of times when I know I coulda been threw in a hearse
So I'm dropping 4s in my soda every time I'm through with a verse
Please do not try to act crazy my nigga cause rugers'll burst
They ready, they on it, they aiming at niggas, my shooters so thirst
G Herbo my name, so a pussy, I can't be
I hang with them menaces, free Jamaes and free Maneski
If it was still slavery, I know the mastas' a hang me
Cause I only respect my momma and granny and aunties
I'm just a young nigga, from the 'go finna blow
And I'm still in the streets, so you know I will take blow for a show
Just let me know, as long as don't nobody search at the door, cause you know how we roll
If anyone try to act like they want smoke, then the club will be closed
No Limit's don't play around, all they know blow
Like they play with they nose
And they taking them souls

[Outro][Verse 1: Cdot Honcho]
In a coupe with them autos in em
Each one got them hollows in em
So when I pull up on ya block
And let the Mac spark
Better hope that his god be with em
My eyes low cause I'm smoking on kill
I ain't lacking bet I'm gripping on steel
Plus I heard niggas plotting on me
Run up on me and his scalp getting pealt
Run up on me and them rounds getting spilled
Run up on me and his crown getting filled
Lil bro posted with the 50 shot
Catch a opp on our block and bananas getting pealt
On the real niggas ain't on shit
Pull up watch his wig get split
Roll a dub while I'm off this big six
Then I hit the club, prolly pay a bitch rent
But I never give a stupid bitch shit
I just give her every inch of this dick
Then I bail out blunts get lit
Flame up tell a bitch get lost
And I'm throwing bullets nigga get mossed
All my young niggas wild letting semis off
Take em down 30 rounds that'll get em off
Smoke sum dope out the pound then I sleep it off

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Yeah Glocks with choppers we got plenty of em
We over east if you want smoke, pull up on yo block and that 50 drumming
On the Essex block with a roll on me and this 4-0 come and get you something
Call lil bro, a nigga want war? Fuck the PoPo we don't give em nothing
Why you think I call my nigga 60 shot? He gone tote for me, he gone keep em coming
Them No Limit Boys a pull on any block, saying fuck Rock, better pick a gun up
We riding round and we got em on us
Run up on you now my niggas one up
Glock with choppers, lurking till the sun up
Hollows in them 50's don't get burnt up

[Verse 3: Cdot Honcho]
And you know my niggas in them Range Rovs
Sipping strait drop with them long poles
Hit the block with them Glocks cocked
Once I send shots watch em lay low
Slugs all in his kangol
Tell my young niggas get his pesos
Homies ask what happen with em
Say them hollows split em cause he ain't go
Next day making sex tapes
While I'm with the bros at yo bitch place
Hit the bitch then forget the bitch
But I left my kids on your bitch face
Drop a nigga then I switch states
And the the car stole so we switch plates
Bezel on me caught yo bitch face
Now she hella on me give my dick space


[Verse 4: Lil Herb]
Look.... And don't forget go cop my mixtape
I got bad hoes in another state
They don't know me but know how my dick taste
And I pray to god I never piss test cause I be smoking dope pouring big 8ths
I be leaning but I ain't lacking boy, run up on me , I'ma make this bitch quake
I like Robin Jeans, I like Trues and Fendi
Price of act? I might choose the Remi
30's, 40's, we got Uzis, Semis
Lots of ammo cause we use too many
Hollows clapping if yo goons offend me
Ain't no snitching, we a loose the witness
And all the opps got empty Glocks,
Don't let em tell you that they out here cause them goons pretending


[Verse 5: Cdot Honcho]
Sneak dissing we a wet em up
Send my bitch to go and set em up
Roll up on em let them Nina's bust
When them hollows hit em ain't not gettin up
Bitch I'm leavin while I'm facing blunts
All my niggas Wildin, feelin semis up
Front his move and we gone hit em up
Heard him talking shit shoot em in his tongue
And the pack I'm smoking it be heavy loud never running out I got plenty of it
And my niggas be hella wild shootin hella rounds they plenty of em
Got them 30's and them 40cals
I a take em down and forget about em
Young niggas brought them drummers out
If you running up, give you 50 of em[Hook – YGG Tay]
Why you talking like that? You ain’t done shit
Why you walking like that? You ain’t done shit
That little bit of hype, you ain’t done shit
I [?] all night, you ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Don’t blow up at the clothes, don’t blow up at the hoes
You ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Go and blow up at the fans on Instagram, you ain’t done shit

[Verse 1 – YGG Tay]
Why you acting like that? You ain’t done shit but run your mouth
You ain’t got a car, you ain’t got no money, you ain’t got a house
It’s that Instagram, that Instagram pumping niggas up
Yeah you got her number and you took her out but you ain’t even fuck
You been in DC and Miami once, now you taking trips
Copped an ounce or two, now you running round talking bout some bricks
Fuck out of here, you need to lay down, you need to take a seat
That little bit of shit, I make your life savings times 3 a week
Think I’m lying, go ask the plug ‘fore they boss my team
You known for nothing, we known for fucking inside of [?]
Like I said, you ain’t known for nothing
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t doing shit, we know you bluffing

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Lil Herb]
You ain’t posted on the block, you ain’t out selling blocks, you ain’t done shit
You ain’t putting no ops, [?] 30 shots
Forty clean up a block, riding round dirty mops
Fuck a little bit of hoes, now you think you on top
I ain’t cuffing no thots, only love what I got
Telling me she in love, no you not, she in love with my Nas
Riding four X 6s, Mercades, E way going crazy
And your bitch drew a dick eating babies, sipping Ace, I be lazy
And this Gucci, this Louis, this Prada, Fendi Hermans, and these Robins ain’t shit
That’s these lil niggas problems with stuffing [?], they want to be famous, not rich
Why you spend all your dough on that bitch, why you ain’t put your bro on that lick
And I’m gone off a four and that crush nigga, pour up some more of that shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – YGG Tay]
You ain’t done shit, cause you’re lazy nigga, you sleep too much
You went in at twelve, I went in at three, I don’t get enough
Them little bit of lights on high G got your head bent
You ain’t never made a dub with a first, man I really did this
You ain’t touching 36, boy you ain’t cop 1000 Gs
You ain’t talking shit but we all know you a wannabe
If you did do it then it wouldn’t be up for discussion
You know how to lie, other than that, you ain’t good for nothing

[Hook][Hook]
Only thing I fuckin care about is money and me
And I swear to god a bitch can't get no money from me
And every nigga thats with me keep a gun
Bet not run up on us cuz we ain't for none
We ain't for none fuck nigga, we ain't for none over here
We ain't for none, we ain't for none over here
We ain't for non fuck nigga, we ain't for none over here
We ain't for none, we ain't for none..


[Verse 1]
We ain't for none
Lil bro blow heat for fun
Posted up with the L's
Gotta whole lotta shells we'll feed you some
And then the peoples come
Nigga I ain't see none
We dont know no names
I ain't see no gun
I can't be build no case, I ain't snitchin
I can see a nigga face that they bitches
I won't look in thru ya eyes, you ain't wit it
Thats the reason Ion pay em no attention
See this bezel on wrist, yea it glisten
If you reach ima have to do a sentence
Cuz my ear a couple g's not to mention
It look like I took my neck to the dentist
All I think about is Jackson's and Bentleys
All I think about is Franklins and Semis
And my car look like a teg with a hemi
And C Money got a tech with a 50
Now we ridin thru the opp shit
Red beams, Glock shit, hollows tryna drop shit
The police can't stop shit
And lil bro gon drop a body
I ain't even gon drop this .. GANG!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Only thing I care about:
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Sike, that shit dont mean shit to me
And thats on Roc's soul
Boy im in this shit wit my niggas
Give a fuck about shit, but my niggas
OG, Grandma, and my sister
And everybody that I lost to that trigga
Nigga I can't die by that trigga
So I gotta stay behind that trigga
Lil Mally, he behind that trigga
Smith and Wesson designed that trigga!
And you know I gotta plan for my niggas
Damn right, I blow bands with my niggas
You can catch me all in Ninas

Still catch me in all black nigga
Run up on him with the mac
50 hollows go BRATT

Better ride thru wit ya flag out
Cuz we got the mags out
Dont get ya car flipped over

[Hook]Got the squad with me and yea we got alotta guns
40,50 drums
Come and get you some, you betta run !
When the Glock spit, leave a nigga top split, if he on that opp shit
Posted on the block tryna make a profit, tottin hot she get popped tryna fuck with my shit
Why I keep telling these fuck niggas I ain't for none?
I can't never sit away, I get up everyday and resume my paper run
But I gotta play it safe cuz around my way niggas hate when yo paper comin
But ima die for my cake, 50 shots in this cannon, ima spray til it don't shoot nothin
And I came from the bottom I won't change for a dollar or nothin
When the times they was hard, it was me and my squad, if it's change then it ain't no fun
Now we ridin in em cars, fuckin all em broads, make a young nigga feel like he up
But shit'll never be the same with the gang, since they killed my nigga Kobe ion give no fucks ![Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
These rappers is actors, they life is in scenes (Cut, cut, cut)
You catch me in traffic, got pipes with the beams
Got so many clips that I could make a movie
Herb got the Uzi up under the Coogi
Them niggas with you they look like some goofys
Gon try to rob me, you gon have to shoot me

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Nigga tryna rob me? That will never happen
Keep my Smith & Wesson
Hollows to his chest some one call a reverend
Taught that boy a lesson, here come 911
Step right over here check him if you ain't check him
Four nickles jam, damn he caught a blessing
Better not come through flexing all my niggas reckless
If you looking for us, just pull up on Essex

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
I trap on the corner no matter the weather
A stack for the sweater, I trap in Margielas
Shooters they with me they pack a Baretta
She let me fuck from the back when I met her
That .357 will send you to heaven
These niggas is tellin my niggas is felons
My bitches dyking like they name was Ellen
Laughing at niggas like they name was Kevin

[Verse 4: Lil Herb]
Aye, codeine what I'm sipping,  gas what I'm inhaling
Posto what you smelling
Rollin up dutches in the living room got my momma yelling
Chill out, why you trippin, fuckin up my session?
Here a couple 100's go watch channel 7
Momma knew I was the man since I was 7
Therefore she don't give a damn about the present

[Verse 5: Lil Bibby]
I hop on the track, you could see what I'm spitting
You niggas wouldn't believe how I'm living
I don't think they could take the heat in the kitchen
I pray my young niggas get freed out the prison
My block is hot, the police is tripping
My niggas savage, don't need a religion
I see niggas oppin then I'm going shopping
I pop out the cut then I'm squeezing and dipping

[Verse 6: Lil Herb]
Hah, and we call that completing the mission
You know everywhere we go got like 2 or 3 poles
Shoot the bitches if you look suspicous

[Verse 7: Lil Bibby]
Play with me, you gon sleep with the fishes
No them killers don't shoot from a distance
And them niggas ain't leaving no witness
Eat up tracks man this beat was delicious

[Hook: Both]
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
Niggas is cappin, they say that they savage
But I ain't heard nothin bout you
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
They say that they trappin, they claim that they got it
But I ain't heard nothin bout you

[Verse 8: Lil Herb]
Before me and Bibby had verses and show money pilling
We were just young niggas wyling
Even though I be rapping about murders and violence
When the police come, I'm silent
Louie V on my shirt, Gabana my shades
Versace my belt, I be stylin
Your bitch says she in love with my "Hot Nigga" verse
Now she sucking my dick from freestyling

[Verse 9: Lil Bibby]
I'm still puttin on for my city
Fuck niggas rapping like Bibby
Still ride around with my glizzy
Pull up and do a nigga like Ricky
Said you can't get out of this game
End up murked like Caine
Y'all niggas be looking like stains
Yung Berg I'll take a nigga chain

[Hook][Intro]
Ha, fufu ass niggas
It's that dope

[Verse 1: Johnny May Cash]
Okay it's cool
These niggas better play it cool before they make the news

[Hook: Johnny May Cash]

[Hook: Johnny May Cash][Intro]

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Young nigga always on that gang bang shit
Bag it up, slang piff, different day same shit
This fame shit came quick, but I can't switch
They try to come and change shit but I remain this
Real nigga from the start to the finish
All my whips are tinted, and all my niggas winnin'
Yeah, you could tell the difference, i'm the realest in it
Don't make me call them killers get you gone in a minute
You know we keep that tool fam, please don't front your move fam
How you on that news cam, you shoulda stayed in school fam
That 30 gets you two grams now, they dreamin' bout a new Lam
And I, walk around with a few grand, everybody got 2 hands
She gon' fuck cause she know we them niggas
Send a bitch to the store for some swishers
So fresh I just pose for the pictures

Judge offers you two years and you told on em?
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
No I won't never leave my brothers they all I got

And i'm pourin' up a 4 right now
And you told me bro you gotta watch these niggas
They're tryna come around you now
These niggas ain't real, same niggas I was with in the field
Boy I treat em like family now
I don't got no deal I don't live in no house on the hill
Fuck nigga this all I got
And i'm still the same nigga got the gang with me
150 killers in the lane with me
In the same city Crazy James with me
Betta not run up on me he gon' bang semis
Slay the game my man bitch I play to win
I won't never change, all the change I spend
All I count is bands, tryna touch an M
When I touch an M, touch an M again
Niggas come around like some immigrants
Ain't no new niggas don't remember him
Who is you nigga you ain't cool nigga
You ain't shoot nigga, just a few niggas
Heard when you get money niggas change
I ran through a lot of that i'm still the same
And my niggas honor that
I know niggas when they left the hood
They ain't bring a dollar back
I trust my niggas they know where my mama at
We brothers nigga
And don't no money come above you nigga
I'll never tell ill do a hunned nigga
Cause I love you nigga

[Hook][Hook]

Catch me in the field, gotta move with the steel
Till the day I get killed or the coppas come get me

Trappin', stretchin' work, bitch that's always
Flexin' on these goofies, bitch that's always

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Coolin' in the trap, gettin' high off that gunsmoke
Niggas sneak diss and imma show 'em what my gun fo'
Lot of rappers actin' remind me of CB4
But I be gettin' money and I don't need to see you folk
Yo' bitch text me, I don't know why you wit her tho
She suck my dick in the morning and ate me like some Cheerio
Turn that bitch around and beat it like my stereo
I be movin' work my plug come from Mexico
I remember sellin' coke, posted by the liquor sto'
Work for niggas, I ain't sellin' packs no mo'
Now I pull up to the trap, big bags like I'm Santa Clause
Now they like Fredo damn what the Phantom cost

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I be high off zips. Sippin pints, drinkin' codeine always
Pour 6 off in my Sprite I been leanin' all day
Woke up tryna fuck yo' bitch cause I know she call late
Always make her suck this dick until her jaws ache
Hit the trap already got fiends waitin' in the hallway
Tryna rob 4-4 hawk 'em down nigga that's a dog chase
Bulldog only hold 6 shots, but he got red beam for a nigga
Fredo in the cut wit the 30 he gon' give everythin to a nigga
Let the choppa sing to a nigga
Mask up cause I know my name ring to them niggas
No Limit that's the team, them my niggas
Always sippin' lean countin' figures
Always got the gat always spendin' money
Always get it back
My bitch told me I'm always in the trap
She talk always, she always gettin slapped

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Capo]
They like Cap why you spend that money like that, that's always
I remember 6217 came out runnin' 'round pissin' (in) dem hallways
And if you wanna smoke fuck nigga you can get it the hard way
Gotta ride with my Glock
Gotta give a nigga shots
If I see dem opps that's always
And shoutout to Zaytoven
Ain't get my earrings yet
Or my watch, but til then my neck frozen
Aye look bitch, I'm holdin'
Where you get that bag from, shit look fake
Yo lil dirty ass stole it
And Yo boyfriend ain't no friend of mine
Can't smoke weed with him and his homies
No his ass ain't no kin of mine
Top from your bitch that's always
Somebody poppin' out the club
This Doowop with a mop and he spark in broad day

[Hook][Intro]
GANG!
Louie what'chu on bro?

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
Another day, another body droppin'
If I go broke then I'mma rob somebody
A fragile body can't survive a shotty
Pump a nigga, I'll slump a nigga
And I been shot at by a bunch a niggas
But I'll still  never run from a nigga
Catch a nigga hollows flyin' for dem niggas
50 hit every last one of niggas
Got some old heads that'll slump a nigga
But you still can get killed by my younger niggas
My young niggas hungry, put 'em on a lick
And they'll take every last thing from a nigga
I got hittas wit' me rollin' off a flat
Now it's hittas in me, ridin' wit' this 30
I might high speed, so I think that I might go get me a Hemi
Lil bro gotta 30 now it's me and 60
We ain't goin' in 'til them bitches empty
Mally tryna make his Glock go empty
Ridin' on them oppers but they block so empty
Kobe make me wanna catch a body
Seeking for revenge, but that's not forgiveness
My niggas ridin' wit' it, they on business
Shoot a brick a hunnid times, put that on Guiness
My hittas know they don't condone the snitchin'
Fuck a trial, broski dome the witness!
Lookin' for them niggas, why they keep sneak dissin'
See him in the field, up the nickel
Niggas act like they pretendin'
Bitch I'm in the field wit' the steel
Niggas say they wanna kill me, act like they forgettin'
Lil bro keep a Glock wit' 30 shots for any block
Wit' red beams to help them pay attention

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Another day, another dollar for me
Wake up and get to the money
Money on me so that tool is on me
If I want him gone, I'll put money on 'em
AKs wit' them hunnids in 'em
Let 'em up, bring out the runner in 'em
Ion bop I do the money dance
Pack louder than an ambulance
I be goin' dumb wit' my big head friends
Them new hun duns make me feelin' friends
I spend hella bands on my Robin jeans
Gotta get this green by any means
Cop killas in the magazines
From the block to the magazines
I'm Mike, yo bitch Billie Jean
Make her best friend lick her belly ring
My life like a Belly scene
Catch me flexin' in that Pelle thing
Bitches want me like a wedding ring
No answer I just let it ring
No time to talk baby 'tml'
And ion set up no voicemail
M.O.B. 'til I D-I-E
Wit' a beam on tha heat, I could shoot a bee
Shoot a creep in the eye and tell 'em, "see"
I told yo dumbass not to fuck wit' me
No love for a bitch I just fuck and leave
She just suckin' dick, and she ugly
I'm sick of gettin' bands I got counterflu
Killas a hit up a carnival
Get shot hella times like its lots of you
We DOA they can't doctor you[Hook]
I keep my pistol on me only at night
Because the haters be tripping,that's right
I keep my pistol on me
I keep my pistol on me

[Lil Bibby]
Late night I'm servin' fiends
And I'm rocked up
In the field with the Glock tucked
Fuck the cops bruh
I ain't trynna' get shot up
My nina on the side of me
It's speedin' through in the ride with me
I'm from the town you know how it be
Got to keep that all times nigga
I ain't lying nigga
Or you gon' end up dying nigga
Shots fired nigga
It's a man down
Leave yo' body juss' layin' 'round
But I'm the one that's sprayin' 'round so it ain't me
Big thirty so it can't be
I keep that
Gotta have it yea I need that
Drop his ass then forget the shit
Herb like where the weed at?
Only kush no seed pack
Word around I got free crack
I'm lackin' don't believe that
Thirty shots on my waist
Give a fuck about no case
Coolin' where it ain't safe
I need a mill on my plate
In this trap shit
Cause I've been doin' this way before this rap shit
Pistol on me in traffic
Real life no actin'
Young niggas they clappin'
And I ain't trynna' get whacked bitch
So damn right I'm packin'
Yea it's on me


[Hook]

[Lil Herb]
I keep my shades on at night
And not the Rays holmes
Cause ion' kick it in a safe zone
If you run up on me you get blazed holmes
And I been learned that
You can't get caught without one
Especially from where I'm from
And if you get caught without that
Then you might just get your scalp cracked
Know a couple niggas that got left behind 'cuz when it's crunch time they was juss' behind
It was clutch time so I kept the nine
And you never know when it's reppin' time
Yea the last time I slipped
I fuck around and got hit
Bitch niggas fuck around with the wrong clique
Must be fuckin' 'round with that shit
Yea it don't feel great but it feel safe when I walk around with the steel eight
So don't play with me cause I will spray
You'll be walkin' 'round with a steel plate
And that's real rap
Try to play me like a fuck nigga and get peeled back
Ion' trust niggas keep 'em real back
In my two-seater with the steel Mac
Pull up on 'em let the steel clap on my own shit
Drop a nigga fire the block up and get locked up at my own risk
Rather catch me wit' it on me
And I do my dirt by my lonely
I'm a real nigga I got real killas'
If I hit 'em up then they'll deal wit' 'em
L's

[Hook][Verse 1]
So much money keep coming, I get it like "what I'ma do with that?"
Buy choppas and clips hold a hunnid, now what I'ma do with that?
Wonder who I'ma shoot with that
Ride through the 8 block and the Rugers clap
Call up J.Dot, broad day face shot
Hollows make his face drop, knock his noodles back
Now how true is that?
Yeah my niggas they doing that
All black, lets go do a hit
Hoodie on, they like "who is that?"
We at war, we got stupid shit
Talking 50 shot macs with the cooling kit
Fazoland where I'm cooling at
Bodies drop, I don't got nothing to do with that
And man it's crazy, that I ain't even made it, but these niggas hate me
And I'm patient cuz I'm still in 1st place, but I ain't even racing
I'm just sprinting to 100's and 50's and Beamers and Bentleys
Yea its with me, if you want it come get me
I move with that semi
Don't come near me, cause I'll act a fool with that semi
In that new SRT8 with a whole pint of drank and a tool in this hemi
Heater right on my lap yea so I'm cool in this Hemi
And when I stop at the light I make sure I grip tight on that pipe

[Hook]
I know niggas out for my life
Gotta look to my left and my right
I'll be damned I get left at the light
Summertime, I remember them nights (2x)

[Verse 2]
Me and Kobe off ACT with the sprite
He just left and they took his life
Wish the lord woulda just let him fight
But don't trip man its gon be aight
Cuz I got lil niggas tryna earn stripes
I could write them a check for your life
They might walk up and check you tonight
40 sneeze we gon' bless you tonight
Mask up broski, lets do it right
Catch a crowd bring them choppas out
Ain't no shooting out the car, nah bro'nem hopping out
Yea, smash on sight fuck the cops we gon' pop it out
And we stay in the field, block busting I'm popping out
NO LIMIT's what's popping now
City love me, ain't nun else to talk about
Labels all on my bumper now
Call Mikk like "bro, what they talking bout?"
If they ain't talking them M's, ain't none else to talk about
Wait 'till my tape drop, watch the label start stalking now

[Hook][Hook: Lil Bibby]
Just a year ago I was stuck off in a slump
I was broke, I ain't have nothin
I came from the bottom that's why I stunt
That's why I stunt, that's why I stunt
Might go broke, ion give a fuck
Pop a pill, that turn a nigga up
Catch me in the club might throw a few bucks
See me in the streets, niggas know what's up
Still throwin my set, that's where I'm from
I ain't worried bout nun, rollin up the blunt
Shittin on niggas that's why I stunt, that's why I stunt
That's why I stunt,and my momma ain't gotta worry bout nun
Ain't got ask no bitch for no money, used to be hungry now I stunt

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
You might catch me in the club counting nothing but one hunneds
Juvenile with cash money, I'm the number 1 stunta
Foreign whips all summer, ridin tinted, gettin blunted
And they all different colors, so you never see me comin
And the reason I be stuntin, is cuz I'm used to havin nothing
Schooling housing by the public, now them thousands ain't a subject
I put money first, trapping all summer call it sunny work
Went from rags to riches pullin bitches with a bummy shirt
Now the city sayin I'm the man in the streets
Going hard for the squad, throwing bands in the streets
I might go broke, but you know just how that go
If I go broke then a nigga getting poked
Nigga don't go then a nigga gettin smoked
Watch I get ghost, like a nigga didn't blow
Make the police think a nigga didn't know, like a nigga didn't know
Fuck the po po, if I had Court then a nigga didn't go
Had to see a PO, then a nigga didn't show
750 cost ten like I'm in a 6 4
I ain't trippin on a ho I'm too busy gettin dough
Same nigga by the sto, posted up, me and bro
Just roll up the dope, thinking bout a year ago

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Winter time I super grind, summer time we stay awake
I'm up early, whipping up the pies like Aunt Shirley
Rollin the loud make the blunt pearly, catch me on the 8 ?
Fuck the jakes, you get stretched for the cake
Bitches know the deal we can't chase erday, we just sex we don't date
Skeet her chest and her face, I flex on them hoes
Fuck like twice then I next on them hoes
Only want a night worth of sex from them hoes
Don't wanna FaceTime or chat with them hoes
I'm sprinting to them stacks, imma hit you right back
Trap full of white made (?) look black
Pull up in that thang with the ceiling pushed back
Riding by myself, but if you pull up on the side you can look at this mac
Remember I used to look at them niggas way back
Remember I used to rock the huaraches with the strap
Remember I didn't know how to fill a kinda stack
But now I'm that nigga and all I do is count em back
Yeah, and that's why I stunt
I ain't worried bout nun I do what I want
I ain't gotta trick on bitches cuz they wanna fuck
I'm just chillin countin digits, and I'm smokin blunts, c money rollin up
And if we pull up on a nigga then he betta duck
Cuz we got hollows in the semi you gone need some luck
My shooters on it, they ain't stopping till they see him drop
Cuz when a nigga kill yo homie you don't give a fuck
In the field for my homies we gone send it up
I'm off a hitta for Roc
R.I.P. free my niggas off the Remy's and Jocs
Used to ridin hot cars, now my shit off the lot
Just to sit on the block

Homeboy flexin' to his bitch, sayin' he know me but I know he lyin'
And, I been fucked his bitch and he been whinin' the whole time
And, his bitch want me to stay over but baby I ain't go the time
And, I told her hold my guap first, she said "Baby do your thing"
And, I can't trust these niggas, so that's why I keep my thang with me
And if you ain't with the street shit, don't get your ass cooked, nigga just for hangin'
And a lot of these niggas start gettin' a little money, then they get to changin'
I'd rather have this money and my niggas with me, shit fuck bein' famous

[Verse 1: Capo]
I'd rather, rather have this money and my niggas with me, shit fuck bein' famous
A lot of niggas talk a lot of shit, so them guns get to aimin'
My niggas don't bullshit, lots of men we bangin'
If you ain't with the street shit, don't get cooked just for hangin'
Pull up on a fuck nigga block and them shots get to ringin'
Sneak dissin' to that bitch, and my phone get to ringin'
Rappin' just to get Slick out, I ain't tryna get famous
[?]
[?] firin' the K, and y'all niggas, y'all fake

Boy play your place with me

And we gang bangin', don't get changed man
We ain't like y'all rappin' ass niggas, got hammers on us, we aimin'
Young nigga I came up from nothin', that's why I'm 'bout a sack
Start finessin', I'm playin' with these racks and I don't know how to act
Remember me, Kobe, Capo, and Duwop was on the block gettin' off the act
RIP Kobe, me and Duwop, Boss, Cap gettin' off the act
We leanin', we dozin' off a four
Bro still got a 30 up on his head, run up we gon' blow
"What happened to them niggas?" We don't know
Tryin' to stack my digits, ain't flexin' for no hoes[Produced by C-Sick]

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
They say I'm from a place where niggas don't make it out
Best thing to do is get your cake and bounce
Word around town, bucks made it now
But I'mma go hard til they take me out
And I'm ridin' with the goons cause the goons gone shoot
Thick white Shawn  don't want a new coupe
If a nigga was a threat then that boy'll be through
Twenty on his head, what the fuck he gone do?
I ain't duckin' no action, I ain't just rappin'
Young niggas clap, we can make it happen
Learned mathematics, fuck with crack addicts
Was gone for a minute now a nigga back at it
I kill for the dough, still kick it though
Still got smoke and it still for the low
In the field with the shit, I'm still with the shit
Niggas know Bibby, I'm as real as it get

[Interlude]
Hold up
(Nigga what's up bro?)
Niggas round here talk crazy bout what they'll do to a motherfucker
(Like what?)
You think I don't worry about a nigga man?
We got more choppers, more lawyers, and our (?)

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I'm from a city where they forever hate
Young nigga wanna see better days
Lotta nights I coulda seen Heaven gates
God stay with me but I never pray
I keep my gun on me, I ain't never safe
And I'mma let it spray naw I won't hesitate
And Mills with the steel cause it's real in the field
Bitch it's kill or be killed, I don't live a better way
Without a doubt I go hard for my niggas
Roc Block, Kobe Squad them my niggas
And yea I got an open heart for my niggas
But still gotta keep a Glock for my niggas
Can't stop me once we squad up, with my niggas
Gettin' money, fuckin' stars is my niggas
They ain't tryna play the part of my niggas
Then I might have to depart from my niggas

[Interlude]
Look it's like what's best for everybody else ain't always whats best for you my man. Can't hand feed no sharks nigga. Still Never Leave My Brothers though

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby + Lil Herb]
Young nigga so sick, need a check up
On the road, people tryna run they check up
Gettin' money, all these hoes wanna sex us
Nigga out of town, still throwin' sets up
Lose your head before I leave it on the curb
This real talk, it's not just some words
Niggas sneak dissin'? Man that nigga got nerves
A call to the city, gotta check up on my nigga Herb like
What up bucks? What up bro?I'm ridin' on east with it on me
I still gotta look to my left and my right
Niggas want me to sleep by my lonely
I'm riding and smoking and thinking
I'm only 19 but feel like a grown-up
Look at the mess that we madeAll these other MCs tryna clone us
Ain't that a bitch
And my face on my dick
Big face on my wrist should be makin' 'em sick
Start hatin' and shit
Man I think they just wanna see a nigga trip
Then I had a thought right when I was about to flip
Gotta calm down, let me hear my nigga TIP like
