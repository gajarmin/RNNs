[Intro: 50 Cent]
It's 50, It's the Unit, that means it's money, ha ha

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Nowadays niggas snitchin' so much in the street
That you gotta talk to them like they the police
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat
I don't know nothin 'bout settlin no beef in the streets
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams
I ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand
Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
Coke, dope, x, dust or crystal meth
Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass

[Hook: Prodigy]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible
All I know who spittin all I know who givin
Me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
Listen, keep it far away from me
I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentiary
All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work
When theb album drop they go bezerk
Mad video play, crazy radio spins
Number one all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
They had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin

[Chorus: Spider Loc
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]
I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
But for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
Have no idea what type of gun they done him with
You see I hear no evil and I see no evil
Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
I don't know why my name in your female's phone
But you really startin to sound like a female holmes
Don't know why they told you that we sell stones
We on the internet tryin to get our Email on

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Nah nigga I don't know who sent them young boys through
To air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue
I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news
I don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands with your bitch in the cruise
Oops my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
Lose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street
I don't know why they said what's up I don't know who's in that jeep
He talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep

[Hook: Mase]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 5: Mase]
I don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm
And why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm
You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel
There's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto
I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggas rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggas wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why them Harlem CB4 niggas just keep comin at me
Got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church
Could you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do[Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No más pistolas y rosas, no
No más [?] con fácil copas, no
Aprendí si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el águila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook][Hook 2X: 50 Cent]
Nigga things, change, never stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

[Spider Loc]
All money ain't good money, this I know
But I still love hood money, I gets my dough
And as a youngster, a nigga went to so much church
And still turned out fucked up, I did so much dirt
Chose to bang the neighborhood, I put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't gunned on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit, just runnin the streets
Without some type of beef the week wasn't complete
It's like a nigga feel better after dumpin his heat
On feet, just to see that body slumped in the seat
Was like a whole nother rush to me, bustin was sweet
Now I'm smarter, I'm all about somethin to eat
I'm on the road, spend 30 days a month in a suite
But I'm still gon' hustle and cheat, let's go

[Hook]

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, uhh, now walkin down the block without'cha weapon
Is a first class ticket to a lesson
I thirst cash, kick it to perfection, me and Ben got a connection
That's why I bring the Benz to impress him
Heart in my zone, all alone homes rattle in my bones
Cause he yappin off his lips and if I hit him I'll be wrong
Cause he ain't never gon' be shit, and I done worked so hard
But I will make you a corn on the cob, you'll be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggas'd pull your card God
I'm on my job, scarred since my nigga gone
HP tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your bomber'll
Be funeral arrangements for your mama
I learned that when I was in pajamas watchin Michael and Madonna
Now I got the appetite of a pirahna, nigga

[Hook]

[Spider Loc]
What nobody knows, all the roads you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to for crumbs
Damn, tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Tools
There's not too many that ever walked in the Loc shoes
Or tell the tale that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
I'm clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that kush weed sparks the brain
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when I pulled up and parked the Range
Your damn right I got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the art of aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, 'til you found out I caught the chain

[Hook]It's a Bluetiful day in my neighborhood
A Bluetiful day in my neighborhood
Remix
Motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Spider Loc]

Im on the blue mic standing in a blue booth
Got that blue light blinking on the bluetooth
Blue water, great big blue sky
Blue royal, all kinds of blue fly
Blue boxers sagging in my blue jeans
Blue chucks on, fat laced blue strings
Got a jacket that's made out of blue socks
Blue knocks on the back of my blue rocks
Snoopy Blue in the cut with the blue steel
We drink blue beast, and pop blue pills
Shoot it out over dope like in Blue Hill
Blue Benz up on four big blue wheels
Hood rats, blue braids, blue nails
Good cat, got an ass like a blue whale
Spray paint got that hood full of blue walls
Bleed blue blood, and got blue balls

[Hook:]
Oh, it's a Bluetiful day
It's a Bluetiful world
I'm in a Bluetiful car
With a Bluetiful girl

It's a Bluetiful night
My chain blinks blue in the night
I'm Bluetiful when I grind
I'm Bluetiful when I shine

[Verse 2:Spider Loc]
Blue berry blunt wrapped
Getting blue back
Bay Mack plaque in the back of the blue Lac'
Navy blue long sleeves on my blue tees
Powder blue knock-offs on my blue dees
Got a bluetiful glow from that blue ice
Crack the crack game nice with the blue dice
Light the blunt with the torche and the flame blue
I'm in the fast lane getting my brains blew
Blue kicks look good with the blue fit
I keep a blue choke chain on my blue pit
Stuff a dub worth of bud in a blue bag
Jumping out of the blue Jag' with a blue rag
Blue belts, blue hats, blue coats
Don't sing but I do hum blue notes (hmmmmm)
High as a kite off of Blue Dolphin
When I go lay me in a blue coffin

[Hook:]

(You next Snoopy Blue ha ha)

[Snoopy Blue talking]
"Hey, hold up Spider. How you going to do a song called 'Bluetiful World' and Snoopy Blue ain't in it? Crip!"

[Verse 3:]

Everything blue from the shirt, to the shoe strings
Rims, to the car, earrings to the chain
Yeah I bang
Cuz' can't you tell from the colors?
Snoopy Blue in the mink in the middle of the summer chilling
My birth stone blue ain't that a trip?
A coincidence, nah I was born a Crip
It's a blue fact the house blue, trim blue
And everytime you see Snoopy he in something blue
From dark blue, to sky blue, royal blue is mine
Sipping Blueway Eastie like the Blue Line
Off a blue Puma, never mind the blue rumors
Bumping Bobby Blue blowing on some blue pursuing
This money blue cause' them blue dice stay skippn'
Like blue flags get shown when niggas' trippin'
I'm in blue more than your whole hood nigga'

Why you think they call me Mr. Snoopy Blue nigga'

Takin' aim at anythang that I see wak-wallin' cuzzzz'

Laughin at shit, burnin shirtz on tha YouTube

Still got tga clip in tha plastic
I'm a crip till 'ma casket

Striking blue ink when I jot down the blueprint
The blue glove coordinate with the blue Hood
That Blue leather look good with the blue wood
Blue phantom and the private jet blue
Fly first class never use jet blue
The blue harley worth more than the blue book
Im colour blind but I love how the blue looks
It's the truth, I'm a true Blue Boss
You cross me and your bound to need Blue cross
I ride with a red rag every Blue moon
Me n smurf getting money in the Blue Loon
Blue baseball cap, ridin for the Blue team
You can run but can't hide from that blue beam
Blue crypt now they fillin up my blue cup
Them boyz in blue is hatin cus I blew up

Blutiful day, Blutiful Night
Red sun and purple Night

She look to blutiful with purple of pearl
And she always wear blue when she banging on the side
Its a blutiful world

[Verse 4: Papa Smurf]
It's P. Smurf, tell 'em throw the red carpet out
My Chucks flaming like bullets when they sparkin' out
Red fox stupid like Redd Foxx
Red Monkeys, rows go with the red rocks
My red bone hair red like Charli Baltimore
Then stopped at the red light, that's how we caught the boy
That red beam got yo' hood fulla red necks
Papa Smurf, only Smurf in a red hat
My clothes red, my pitbull nose red
Hoes clothes red, cross me you be mo' red
I drank red Remy thizz off a red Nykey
Red Levis saggin' on my red Nikes
Red rubberbands hoppin' out a red Benz
Eat red snapple, smoke more than Redman
Cherry swisher fulla cush got my eyes red
Red Gucci shades, look like the sky red

Can you picture purple pain in the rain when thugs cry
Purple rain up in the pane when the flood high
Purple jordans, with the purple leather slips
Purple Lig purple banada's in the stitch
Purple work the grey in the grey goose
Got the purple manson shirts and the stones in the a souse
A coouple purple codings, a couple purple Pills
Feeling like D-12 running up a purple Hill
Smoke weed still hate to taste the swishes
I go that purple cush stack all wrapped ina grapeliscious
Colour purple is my favourite picture
Red and Blue lead to puple thats a perfect picture
Purple Rag around the Mag, so its perfect with the tools
So everthing i hit turns purple n then blue
Come up in this grapevine like i hold a purple heart
Frutiful, Frutiful, purple with a purple car

This is from the ourtown nigga, claim your hood
Helped him get his chain back bang on Suge
Homie don't trip we can G-Unit then he tried to
Jump shook and leave you in it
You might beef with the homies but this the turf
You diss G-Unit loc then you diss the turf
I walks with no feelings show no fears
Even if I'm sitting on this shelf for 4 more years
Deals don't need them back you ain't no outlaw
You on C-Bo sack you might crack, and telling us be easy
You sell your soul if you can just be cheesy
They gonna to diss you in the south, might as well let
Baby kiss you in the mouth what you did in the dark
Came to the light then jumped on the phone and wanna
Play on the mic, and I'm like

[Hook: Spider Loc]

They don't make G'z like they used to
I still squeeze like I used to
I got mo' G'z then I used to
But I still roll this like I used to 2x

[Verse 2: Spider Loc]

To make this go away is gonna take a miracle
All you can say your take was a year ago
I understand you took me to the blood
But I'm a man you must have took me for a dub
What you did makes me so sick, switched up
You on Doja dick?
You said he ain't no blood and you ain't no cuz (remember)
But cuz now its on though it ain't no love
This shit ride like it's supposed to go
I beat the shit out of rap niggas Sosa know
You must be sueded off the wip
Got kicked off the click and then booted
Off the set, every word that i say on this
Track is true, quit crying i gotta pay taxes too
See the THC level in my eyes?
You must be think SPI is the devil in disguise
I'm like

[Hook: Spider Loc]

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]

It's a shame what this lames will do for some fucking fame
This ain't a fucking game, fuck Buck and Game
I bang that capital letter G (Unit) come on cuz
Have to know better, Baymaac gonna blast then I'm gonna
Pop ???? the realest gonna come out on top
I turn the whole county on the hook
While you ???????? get your butterfly tat y'all can cry
Together, then come where I'm at so y'all can die together
Who lied to Buck, Chuck played you twice, remember trying to
Buy your chain and he raised the price?
Besides I'm the truth is what you are to see
You two goofballs lost Snoop Dog a G (haha haha)
Switched up real quick like, on the set I know my
Nigga thinking like damn

[Spider Loc with Young Buck on the phone][Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No más pistolas y rosas, no
No más [?] con fácil copas, no
Aprendí si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el águila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook]It's a Bluetiful day in my neighborhood
A Bluetiful day in my neighborhood
Remix
Motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Spider Loc]

Im on the blue mic standing in a blue booth
Got that blue light blinking on the bluetooth
Blue water, great big blue sky
Blue royal, all kinds of blue fly
Blue boxers sagging in my blue jeans
Blue chucks on, fat laced blue strings
Got a jacket that's made out of blue socks
Blue knocks on the back of my blue rocks
Snoopy Blue in the cut with the blue steel
We drink blue beast, and pop blue pills
Shoot it out over dope like in Blue Hill
Blue Benz up on four big blue wheels
Hood rats, blue braids, blue nails
Good cat, got an ass like a blue whale
Spray paint got that hood full of blue walls
Bleed blue blood, and got blue balls

[Hook:]
Oh, it's a Bluetiful day
It's a Bluetiful world
I'm in a Bluetiful car
With a Bluetiful girl

It's a Bluetiful night
My chain blinks blue in the night
I'm Bluetiful when I grind
I'm Bluetiful when I shine

[Verse 2:Spider Loc]
Blue berry blunt wrapped
Getting blue back
Bay Mack plaque in the back of the blue Lac'
Navy blue long sleeves on my blue tees
Powder blue knock-offs on my blue dees
Got a bluetiful glow from that blue ice
Crack the crack game nice with the blue dice
Light the blunt with the torche and the flame blue
I'm in the fast lane getting my brains blew
Blue kicks look good with the blue fit
I keep a blue choke chain on my blue pit
Stuff a dub worth of bud in a blue bag
Jumping out of the blue Jag' with a blue rag
Blue belts, blue hats, blue coats
Don't sing but I do hum blue notes (hmmmmm)
High as a kite off of Blue Dolphin
When I go lay me in a blue coffin

[Hook:]

(You next Snoopy Blue ha ha)

[Snoopy Blue talking]
"Hey, hold up Spider. How you going to do a song called 'Bluetiful World' and Snoopy Blue ain't in it? Crip!"

[Verse 3:]

Everything blue from the shirt, to the shoe strings
Rims, to the car, earrings to the chain
Yeah I bang
Cuz' can't you tell from the colors?
Snoopy Blue in the mink in the middle of the summer chilling
My birth stone blue ain't that a trip?
A coincidence, nah I was born a Crip
It's a blue fact the house blue, trim blue
And everytime you see Snoopy he in something blue
From dark blue, to sky blue, royal blue is mine
Sipping Blueway Eastie like the Blue Line
Off a blue Puma, never mind the blue rumors
Bumping Bobby Blue blowing on some blue pursuing
This money blue cause' them blue dice stay skippn'
Like blue flags get shown when niggas' trippin'
I'm in blue more than your whole hood nigga'

Why you think they call me Mr. Snoopy Blue nigga'

[Hook:]INTRO:

Stuff a dove worth the buzz in a blue bag
Jumpin' out the blue Jag

Remixx

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]
Im in a Blue vint, Blue grill Blue tint
Striking blue ink when I jot down the blueprint
The blue glove coordinate with the blue Hood
That Blue leather look good with the blue wood
Blue phantom and the private jet blue
Fly first class never use jet blue
The blue harley worth more than the blue book
Im colour blind but I love how the blue looks
It's the truth, I'm a true Blue Boss
You cross me and your bound to need Blue cross
I ride with a red rag every Blue moon
Me n smurf getting money in the Blue Loon
Blue baseball cap, ridin for the Blue team
You can run but can't hide from that blue beam
Blue crypt now they fillin up my blue cup
Them boyz in blue is hatin cus I blew up
G-Unit

[Hook 2:]
Blutiful day, Blutiful Night
Red sun and purple Night
I'm blutiful for every car that I drive
It's a blutiful world
Blutiful girl with all red curls
She look to blutiful with purple of pearl
And she always wear blue when she banging on the side
Its a blutiful world

[Verse 4: Papa Smurf]
It's P. Smurf, tell 'em throw the red carpet out
My Chucks flaming like bullets when they sparkin' out
Red fox stupid like Redd Foxx
Red Monkeys, rows go with the red rocks
My red bone hair red like Charli Baltimore
Then stopped at the red light, that's how we caught the boy
That red beam got yo' hood fulla red necks
Papa Smurf, only Smurf in a red hat
My clothes red, my pitbull nose red
Hoes clothes red, cross me you be mo' red
I drank red Remy thizz off a red Nykey
Red Levis saggin' on my red Nikes
Red rubberbands hoppin' out a red Benz
Eat red snapple, smoke more than Redman
Cherry swisher fulla cush got my eyes red
Red Gucci shades, look like the sky red

[Hook 2:]

[Verse 5: Piper]
Can you picture purple pain in the rain when thugs cry
Purple rain up in the pane when the flood high
Purple jordans, with the purple leather slips
Purple Lig purple banada's in the stitch
Purple work the grey in the grey goose
Got the purple manson shirts and the stones in the a souse
A coouple purple codings, a couple purple Pills
Feeling like D-12 running up a purple Hill
Smoke weed still hate to taste the swishes
I go that purple cush stack all wrapped ina grapeliscious
Colour purple is my favourite picture
Red and Blue lead to puple thats a perfect picture
Purple Rag around the Mag, so its perfect with the tools
So everthing i hit turns purple n then blue
Come up in this grapevine like i hold a purple heart
Frutiful, Frutiful, purple with a purple car

[Hook 2:][Intro: 50 Cent]
It's 50, It's the Unit, that means it's money, ha ha

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Nowadays niggas snitchin' so much in the street
That you gotta talk to them like they the police
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat
I don't know nothin 'bout settlin no beef in the streets
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams
I ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand
Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
Coke, dope, x, dust or crystal meth
Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass

[Hook: Prodigy]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible
All I know who spittin all I know who givin
Me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
Listen, keep it far away from me
I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentiary
All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work
When theb album drop they go bezerk
Mad video play, crazy radio spins
Number one all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
They had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin

[Chorus: Spider Loc
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]
I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
But for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
Have no idea what type of gun they done him with
You see I hear no evil and I see no evil
Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
I don't know why my name in your female's phone
But you really startin to sound like a female holmes
Don't know why they told you that we sell stones
We on the internet tryin to get our Email on

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Nah nigga I don't know who sent them young boys through
To air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue
I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news
I don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands with your bitch in the cruise
Oops my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
Lose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street
I don't know why they said what's up I don't know who's in that jeep
He talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep

[Hook: Mase]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 5: Mase]
I don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm
And why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm
You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel
There's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto
I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggas rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggas wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why them Harlem CB4 niggas just keep comin at me
Got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church
Could you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad doCccccriiipppppp
Kushhhh
Gang-banga's

[J-Love:]
White tee, blue jeans, gotta sag with em'

6 foot, 2 inches I'm a real crip
Shine like a diamond

Lay 20's need' I still gotta' baby face
Play me wrong I'll have ya singin' songs like baby face
Smokin' blunts on tha grind is ma dad to day
I'm a diamond so I shine from a mile away
Like a cowboy you'll catch me in dat blue need' grey
Ruff ridin' with gorilla's, you'll get blown away
Try need' front cause, you'll get dumped on in California
Caught slippin' in dat alley like that nigga reapa
I keep it cool but characters got alot to say
They want a crip to slip in traffic need' get washed away
For now I'm slipin' bars, I let em' think I let it ride
Designate that ass at the designated time

[Hook x2]

[Spider Loc:]
Lay low I'm a crip
But I dun know when tha day was
It turned cool for all these fools to say they cause
It's all true u gotta see me talkin'
I'm sick of these G's I see on tha TV C walkin'
You see I gang- bang like a famous Raymon
Before this rap fame 'ma names bin rangin'
It's like, chhiity-chitty 9 South neighborhood
East side EC land of no pitty
Known for almost fallin' off
But I bounce back ballin'
Takin' aim at anythang that I see wak-wallin' cuzzzz'
Blue bandana, left side blue shoes
Laughin at shit, burnin shirtz on tha YouTube
See - sellin his rope-chain on E-Bay
No brain what can they say about a key-weight
Take shit on a red truck trippin in traffic
Still got tga clip in tha plastic
I'm a crip till 'ma casket

[Hook x2]

[Lil Boss:]
Blue flag in da bak of ma blue catt
I'm a hood rat

Constantly on ma grind

Why can't these nigga's see I shine on em'

Don't waste my muthafuckim time on em'

[Hook x4][Verse 1 - Jay Rock]
Jay Rock, well connected in these streets, I'm a legend
Testified, the reason why your momma dialed 9-11
Ride for my line, no questions gotta stay alive
Stay inside if you tryna subside a homicide
It's suicide to test me, the iron if you press me
They say the game cold but I don't know Wayne Gretzky
Keep the flamethrower in my coat if you disrespect
The clips' known to make a scene when I hit the set
Play your cards right or hit the deck
The tech hit your flesh and your silhouette
Corner store carnivores
Fiends schemin', "what the fuck you want a quarter for?"
I make a drop off, then I order more
I'm with the killers and the thieves, hide your Audemar
And if I got the thumper, I'mma hit you with it
Blood, I'm on 112 obitual with it

[Hook]
We on the avenue, we on the boulevard
We blockin' off the block, we corner corner-shops
We in the street, we in the street
We in the street, we in the street

[Verse 2 - Jay Rock]
Mmm, smellin' like dinner time
You got a five star mill on you, give me mines
And when I take it make sure you don't drop any dimes
You play Magic Earvin
You gon' see a black burner and a black turban
That's a black mask
And tell your bitch to get that necklace out her handbag
You see it's cutthroat
And my reality is cut dope and gun smoke
Another casualty the family in the front row of the church pews
A politician don't understand a hood nigga' views
You see them devils in them black and whites
And hit the lights, we hit them corners like Regis on a Monday night
I'm in the spot like a dalmation
Bake a cookie dinner, nigga break it, go 'head nigga taste it
You know I keep them goodies in the oven
Dawg it's nothin' want a dish, say somethin'
Holla at me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Spider Loc]
Smack the back of my hand with a fresh pack
At the meeting the homies know I press facts
Can't ignore that he-say, she-say
He pillow talk, what she say, he say
On Keeway, they wanna see me in the pen
Gettin' ends tryin' not to fall completely into sin
Ever been in a trap where everywhere you turn
You learn it won't help for you to make a U-turn
Been through bullshit it only made the S better
Recorded with Cube, arguably the best ever
Ask me, it gotta be a conspiracy
Still, no hate in my spirit, see
They keep my reputation like "why are you the worst"
No matter how you rehearse they don't vibe through the verse
Will my world wide web ever hit these fans
Only God knows, it's out of 50's hands

[Hook][Verse 1: Young Buck]
They say god bless the child that can hold his own
And he who is loyal, allways live long
A real hood nigga gets money and gives back
So when i got money bitch i did just that
I put packs in the hands of the dope man
Put gats in the hands of my old friends
Listen when i tell ya, i dident even really know game
When i said his name, on pop em them thangs
Yea i got on all blue, thats how i do
Tommarow its all red the bloods love me too
Im true, and every nigga around me knew it
But you, are only hard around ya boys
I knew, when fiffty gave you your first watch
Wrote you ya first verse, wrote you ya first drop
We dident really need ya, homie know im gone see ya
Dont ever bite the hand and feed ya
Bitch niggaaa

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Now if its beef, then go ahead, let the war start
Do what you do best, have a change of heart
You a man with breast, simaller to a brawd
You disrespect that the west when they find out who you are
Do ya thug thing, spit ya 300 bars
But me and banks garage, makes up 300 cars
You not a solder homboy, you come from a stripp clubb
Ya name is dolja, i can show you the pictures blood
The game is over, nigga change ya cloths
Look at cha, you lookin like a video how
And i was on the phone when spider loc called ya
Ya punk ass said you ain't want no problem
You try to diss memph bleek, throw lines at jay
Have ya ass apologyzin, the vary next day
Damn right radio gone play my shit
Wonda what trey gone say bout thise
Game over

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]
Now i seen that tought talk and it swell to find it
And thats why, for so long, i can held my silence
But im from ec g-unit, i bangs the game
And its needless to say, that i slang them thangs
I got love for the west, and im asamed of game
And not because his album was full of famous names
See im everything he wishin he was, but hes nothin like me
Can't you tell from all the dissin he does. he be all about poblesity buzz
Cause when he meet at the club, he be all about kisses and hugs
He rent yukmout the loc, you ain't touch him one time
When you said, that joe buddens was only punch lines
Out here we gangbang, know for known for heatin up guest
Thats that, [somethin] beatin up rats
Underbated, cause its hard to understand this nigga
Hes spose to represent the riders, but he ran from jail[Hook 2X: 50 Cent]
Nigga things, change, never stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

[Spider Loc]
All money ain't good money, this I know
But I still love hood money, I gets my dough
And as a youngster, a nigga went to so much church
And still turned out fucked up, I did so much dirt
Chose to bang the neighborhood, I put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't gunned on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit, just runnin the streets
Without some type of beef the week wasn't complete
It's like a nigga feel better after dumpin his heat
On feet, just to see that body slumped in the seat
Was like a whole nother rush to me, bustin was sweet
Now I'm smarter, I'm all about somethin to eat
I'm on the road, spend 30 days a month in a suite
But I'm still gon' hustle and cheat, let's go

[Hook]

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, uhh, now walkin down the block without'cha weapon
Is a first class ticket to a lesson
I thirst cash, kick it to perfection, me and Ben got a connection
That's why I bring the Benz to impress him
Heart in my zone, all alone homes rattle in my bones
Cause he yappin off his lips and if I hit him I'll be wrong
Cause he ain't never gon' be shit, and I done worked so hard
But I will make you a corn on the cob, you'll be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggas'd pull your card God
I'm on my job, scarred since my nigga gone
HP tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your bomber'll
Be funeral arrangements for your mama
I learned that when I was in pajamas watchin Michael and Madonna
Now I got the appetite of a pirahna, nigga

[Hook]

[Spider Loc]
What nobody knows, all the roads you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to for crumbs
Damn, tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Tools
There's not too many that ever walked in the Loc shoes
Or tell the tale that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
I'm clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that kush weed sparks the brain
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when I pulled up and parked the Range
Your damn right I got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the art of aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, 'til you found out I caught the chain

[Hook][Spider Loc]
This bitch boy can not see me
Listen to the way I rhyme
On the streets I got that easy
This West Coast is mine

I got a hundred young niggas wit me hollerin' 2 c's
Wack and Pooh rider, them my niggas from 2 p's
I smashed in the 90's and I run into 2 g's
You ain't a gangbanger so you run in wit 2 tees
You hurricane stompin' with the flame bandana
In Compton they say you used to glaze Santana
You gave that up, and really start trippin'
And yo Doja could you tell me, what made ya start strippin'?
You did change your heart, and now it's Piru
On DVD talkin like the downest Damu
But Doja, you know just as well as I do
The truth is the story that you tell is not true
Doja be in a gang for the last few years
And tried to go from tongue rings to them tattooed tears
Stop the frontin' You ain't wit the funken at all
You really ain't nuttin' more than dunkin' a ball
Rev Riders Red Rags
Everybody knowin' you a nobody that sound like everybody flowin
You ain't got no background you talk about T.V
If it ain't about 2Pac, It's all about Easy
If it ain't about Easy, It's all about Fif and the Unit
I wonder who's listenin' to it
Jumped on Dre's dick and do nuttin to Yucmouth
Memphis Bleek or Joe Budden
I've come to the conclusion you got to be special or retarded
How the Fuck'd you get me started
But a war with the Loc, you don't wanna try that
You steady goin' broke and gettin' butterfly tats
When Fosen died you lost ya G side
And I just spoke with G Malone and G Ride
And they said no bullshit, it's on fo' real
You get popped, if you try to pop up on Brazil
Oh I'm from, that's just how the politics go
I got a boss from New York that knows how to get doe
I'm a Loc from L.A. that knows how to kick flow
In big blue diamonds look how my shit glow
You don't know, where I'm from
You don't know, where you from
You can catch me in the Yukon hittin' on fire
Or pushin' up century, gettin' head from Mya
And I don't really wanna let the Tec speak
So Bitch Boy, check your technique
And while your at that check the streets good
The Eastside Riders don't fuck with Eastwood
You just a bad look for the Dymu's
Tight drawers saggin', hatin' ya high school
G-Unit! On the plaque of the lowrider
Da rats in the hood holla "Go Spidah!"
I'm from the most gang and I flow tighter
Take back the Bentley's, go get a ghost rider
Jacion callin' for peace
He said it his self, you should call the police
If you ever see the G-Unit Crips, I'mma EC banger with G-Unit chips
I can tell that you hate it alot
But I'mma stay on top, if ya hate it or notIt's a blutiful day in my neighborhood x2

I'm on the blue mic standin in the blue booth
Got that blue light blinkin on the blue tooth
Blue water, great big blue sky
Blue royal, all kind of blue fly
Blue boxers saggin in my blue jeans
Blue chucks on, fat laced blue strings
Got a jacket thats made out of blue fox
Blue knocks on the back of my blue rocks
Snoopy blue in the cut with the blue steel
We drink blue beast, and pop blue pills
Shoot it out over dope like in Blue Hill
Blue benz on four big blue wheels
Hood rats, blue braids, blue heels
Good cat, got an ass like a blue whale
Spray paint got the hood full of blue walls
Bleed blue blood, and got blue balls

Chorus:
Oh, Its a blutiful day
It's a blutiful world
I'm in a blutiful car
And got a blutiful girl

It's a blutiful night
My chain blings blue in the light
I'm blutiful when I grind
I'm blutiful when I shine

How many times i gotta holla how this white shit mine
And all this is bad boy, you did not get shyne
The chains glow just watch the shine
See what time is it, gotta watch this grind
I can do this on an off night
Sell crack to powder fiends and have em crush a pack of soft white
Tell em bring it if its cost right
Call em ballerina on this clothes like a frostbite
Have the fiends burn his fingers on the exhaust pipe
No sleep, street dreamer can't exhaust pipe
I'm everywhere, you ain't never there
You like chess, wanna make a move but you debatin where
I keep a fifty between my legs like i'm braidin hair
I leave cream around her mouth like a bakers square
Check the closet, it ain't a pair of apes in there
MJ's in there, Blue Jays in there

Chorus[repeat 2X]
I am, al-ways, there
You are, ne-ver, there

[over repeat]
Heh-heh
S.P.I., and Kurupt

[Hook 2X: unknown female singer]
I ain't mad at 'cha (I ain't mad at 'cha)
You ain't mad at me (you ain't mad at me)
After all this bullshit, it's nonsense, no time for that

[Spider]
Niggas upset me from buckin, they ride in Rolls
While these bitch niggas tucked in, hidin rolls
Don't speak on it nigga, collide in blows
But be careful, the fo' can hide and close
In an instant, your chest can divide in holes
It's cruicial, but that's how this ridin goes
Ain't a nigga out here Eastsidin knows
It's a no-no, must not confide in hoes
I roll low-lows, love how it glide and glows
Provided by the fact I supply them O's
I'm the coldest in the streets, that's why they chose
What MC live and dies by they flows?
I grew, fought hard for the line I drew in the yard
And all must regard I'm true
'Til I'm through, I push it from my point of view
High off cush and the tires on the two
Hood gospel, from the in hood apostle
Paintin pictures, lyrical Picasso
In and out of Wasco for packin a rosco
Plus I'm pushin more products than CostCo
Guard your grill, your jaw hard to heal
And my hands will leave you scarred with skill
Got my feelings pushed down too far to feel
And I never spit rounds out the car to kill
Talk is cheap, I'ma stalk and creep
Like a hawk, leave chalk when I walk the street
Talk is cheap, I'ma stalk and creep
Like a hawk, leave chalk when I walk the street

[Hook]

[repeat 4X]
I am, al-ways, there
You are, ne-ver, there

[Eastwood]
Baby I'm all about my scrilla and seein figures paintin the perfect picture
With my mind on this crazy life, workin what I was given
Two sisters, three brothers, no father loved my mother
Cause my daddy wasn't there for the times that I struggled
Yeah I lost my G-moms and it hurt so bad
But rest in peace and let your soul fly free I ain't sad
I got this thug shit runnin through my veins, Lord watch me
So many they try to copy a natural kamikaze
You can never walk the shoes of 'Wood, I'm a natural born leader
And plus I been discovered by Suge
So please believe it homey, I ain't gon' change for shit
It's Death Row, the millenium clique, self-made nigga

[Hook]

[repeat to fade]
I am, al-ways, there
You are, ne-ver, there[Verse 1: Spider Loc]

This is from the ourtown nigga, claim your hood
Helped him get his chain back bang on Suge
Homie don't trip we can G-Unit then he tried to
Jump shook and leave you in it
You might beef with the homies but this the turf
You diss G-Unit loc then you diss the turf
I walks with no feelings show no fears
Even if I'm sitting on this shelf for 4 more years
Deals don't need them back you ain't no outlaw
You on C-Bo sack you might crack, and telling us be easy
You sell your soul if you can just be cheesy
They gonna to diss you in the south, might as well let
Baby kiss you in the mouth what you did in the dark
Came to the light then jumped on the phone and wanna
Play on the mic, and I'm like

[Hook: Spider Loc]

They don't make G'z like they used to
I still squeeze like I used to
I got mo' G'z then I used to
But I still roll this like I used to 2x

[Verse 2: Spider Loc]

To make this go away is gonna take a miracle
All you can say your take was a year ago
I understand you took me to the blood
But I'm a man you must have took me for a dub
What you did makes me so sick, switched up
You on Doja dick?
You said he ain't no blood and you ain't no cuz (remember)
But cuz now its on though it ain't no love
This shit ride like it's supposed to go
I beat the shit out of rap niggas Sosa know
You must be sueded off the wip
Got kicked off the click and then booted
Off the set, every word that i say on this
Track is true, quit crying i gotta pay taxes too
See the THC level in my eyes?
You must be think SPI is the devil in disguise
I'm like

[Hook: Spider Loc]

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]

It's a shame what this lames will do for some fucking fame
This ain't a fucking game, fuck Buck and Game
I bang that capital letter G (Unit) come on cuz
Have to know better, Baymaac gonna blast then I'm gonna
Pop ???? the realest gonna come out on top
I turn the whole county on the hook
While you ???????? get your butterfly tat y'all can cry
Together, then come where I'm at so y'all can die together
Who lied to Buck, Chuck played you twice, remember trying to
Buy your chain and he raised the price?
Besides I'm the truth is what you are to see
You two goofballs lost Snoop Dog a G (haha haha)
Switched up real quick like, on the set I know my
Nigga thinking like damn

[Hook: Spider Loc]

[Spider Loc with Young Buck on the phone][Intro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah it's the talk of New York (yeah yeah yeah nigga!)

Let me tell you how to school y'all young niggas man

[Hook: Tony Yayo]
22's on a Porsche truck, Henny in the fridge

If we can't eat then your team can't live
That's how it is, it is what it is
Nigga that's how it is, it is what it is
Nigga that's how it is, it is what it is (here we go!)

[Tony Yayo]
I'm Crip'n, heaven gates open meet your maker
My pistol get it poppin like the Pistons and the Pacers
I'm the messenger of misery, I move discreet
You kiddin me? My victory is in the jaws of defeat
And these haters wanna kill me cause my dreams is reality
The cig' with the beam will cause a fatality
Just caught a case but it's a minor technicality
With shooters on the street, prosecutors keep houndin me (break it down now!)
Whatchu know about, Grammy speeches, sandy beaches
Pounds of seedless, pounds and sweepers
Movie features, groupie divas, deal with sneakers
Secluded in the woods from them snakes and leeches (yeah!)
I'm makin money on the road homie autographin ass
While you on the silver horse witcha Metro pass (what nigga)
For every dollar you make nigga I make a G
Damn it feels good to live life like me, c'mon!

[Hook]

[Spider Loc]
When it's Spider and big Yay', we doin it which way?
Real big cause he stay where the rich stay (nigga)
We get it crackin like a high school ditch day
Ghetto mack in this how I do the itch-bay
A Escalade and a two-shade six-tre'
With his life is the price that the snitch pay
But it's political, my paper sproutin
My girl get upset I don't take her out and
My choice of occupation make her doubtin
I'll be out the front do', I can't take the poutin
I'm about anythang, that'll make a mountain
Of this moolah; ooh all the cake I'm countin
See the game too deep, I can't shake I'm scoutin
The clout; our fans loud like the Lakers shoutin
Tryna have me a flat with some acres
Out in the boondocks, so I move without them fakers
G-Unit!

[Hook]

[Tony Yayo]
I'm filthy so stop hatin, the milli's what I'm wavin
You guilty by association, you payin for operations
Your kids be orphans, coughin up organs
You sprayin up your Benz, you layin in coffins
It's G-Unit clique NIGGA, you love how we spit NIGGA
My wrists glist' in glitter cause we sittin on six NIGGA
Yo it's all about the Benjamins, feel the adrenaline
Yo we killin 'em, with beats from, Dre and Eminem
Your bitch keep grillin me, I know she feelin me (yeah!)
My last cap and gown was, in elementary (uh-huh)
The kid is back, the kid is strapped, I'm hot hot
The way we rap, we blazin tracks, you not not

So we keep the club packed, for the fire marshals (one more time!)
Nigga Em on the beat I had to, hire Marshall
So we keep the club packed, for the fire marshals, yeah! (HERE WE GO!)

[Hook]

[Tony Yayo - repeat 2X]

You can't see me, it's the incredible
Rider from ECG, young reputable
A good excuse is hard to come up with
A nigga just came up hard, I'm corrupted
I'm a hog I like shootin' at pigs
Never mind your vest I like shootin' at wigs
It's gonna take a miracle
I'm evil for spiritual and ever so lyrical
I induce mind states
I drink cognac by the crate tryin' to get my mind straight
Curtis Jackson cut the check
And without Spider Loc tell me what's the west? (a mess)
It ain't what it's 'posed to be
What MC on the coast is coming close to me?
I'm everything that they 'posed to be
Lil T mean the most to me

[Hook: Spider Loc] x2
New York, New York big city of dreams
Who gives a fuck where a nigga from? Gimme the green
I ain't no fool, L.A. my town
But this is hip hop and Fitty the king


[Verse 2: Popa Smurf]
Red L.A. hat, ride through the Bronx
Got 5 blunts burnin' gettin' higher than fuck
Spider hooked me up with this east coast connect
Now I'm going back to Cali with a piece on my neck
Dirty south central, feet off the jet
G-Unit west, I eat off of that
Look at the world different behing them Gucci shades
I swear to God, I won't rest 'til my crew get paid
I put instrumentals in hospitals
So fuck you MCs, I spit for my niggas
On the chirp with some hoes from Jersey
Smurf, I got hoes like a jersey
(What?) Me and my boys
Been wearin' white t's before Dem Franchise Boys
I got the 38 chillin'
Higher than the Empire State Buildin'

[Hoook]
