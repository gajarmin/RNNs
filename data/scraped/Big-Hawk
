[Intro: Big Hawk]
H.A.dub.K, hater proof
Kyle Lee, Robert Earl Davis
This is for you baby
Know what I’m saying

[Verse 1: Big Hawk]
In the turning lane, six CD change
Trunk full of bang like change then I swang
Smoking Mary Jane as I grip wood grain
It’s kinda hard to explain why I’m so off the chain
Still banging screw, riding candy blue
I don’t gang bang so I ride red too
Ever since 92 I’ve been screwed up
Syrup in my cup and that strawberry crush
Sitting on buck or sitting on grey
D to the A it’s the H.A.dub.K
Still to this day I’m still screw head
Even though screw dead I’m still doing what he said
Repping S.U.C repping P.A.T
Repping Mafio and Gata of patn’ me
What screw did for me, was real as can be
That’s why the whole world must know it’s legacy

[Chorus: ]
I’d rather bang screw while I’m on the block riding through my hood
Grey tape in the deck, while I’m sipping drank and smoking good
I’m talking bout that Pat and that S.U.C coming out my trunk
Or maybe E.S.G while I swang and bang to the ocean of funk

I’d rather bang screeew, yeee, know wha I’m saying
Said, I’d rather bang my screeeew, know wha im sayin x2

[Verse 2: Big Cease]
It gotta be slow down if it gone bang in my ride
I was raised in the tex and I rep it with pride
Grey tape in the deck of the slab at all times
RIP to the legend, true king of the south
Who would of thought back in 92
The whole world dripping candy and jamming Screw
I'm sure he knew it cause he started the movement
Slowing down the music now it’s all eyes on Houston
Pistol trolls sliding all the way slow
While I'm buried over gold, while I'm sipping on a 4
Peep the crops fader, make the beat studder
RIP to H.A.dub.K's brother
That’s the Fat P, haters won’t like me
When they see the DVD with Big Hawk and Kyle Lee
Big Cease I represent hater proof
And I done heard it all before but I’d rather bang screw

[Chorus: ]

[Verse 3: Kyle Lee]
I’ma screw head till I D.I.E
And I got ghetto dreams like P.A.T
Do you remember, creeping in my window
Month of September, riding foreign car in the winter
Throwed then a bitch, as the wood wheel twist
Diamonds on my fist, I’m leaning on a switch
Tipping on 4's, got candy on my doors
Diesel on my chest, banks on my toes
Don’t approach hoes, real players get chose
Classy L Vogues on my wide body loads
June 27th, whose next to plex
I’m a south side player from Screwston, Tex
Sitting sideways with the H.A.dub.K
On the highway blowing blueberry haze
Screw in the deck while I hogg the lane
Slow mo music is all I bang

[Chorus: ][Intro]
In the beginning, we were those kids
That played on the dirt fields
But with determenation
We came from the bottom
And rose to the top
We chased and grabbed
Ahold of our dreams
Now we play on the fields
Where the grass is greens
And we can tell by the
Looks on their face
When they find out what the
Dream is we chased
They hate
But we as a team
Have a phrase we say when
Negativity comes our way
Don't tread on this

[Verse 1]
Game took hold like the roots of a tree
Think soccer ain't a sport?
Then why'd NIKE sign me?
Cause I got on my job
And made the game ferocious
I was born with a drive
I got that from no coaches
Big hulking duece
Spittin truth in the booth
Stop drop and role
I brings down the roof
Got nothing to lose
And everythin to prove
Don't change the mood
Cause we done payed our dues
Best to give way
For the USA
Now we're hot
You might think we're a sun ray
In over your heads
Southside, we fed
This is life and I'm grinding
Until I'm dead
Thanks to DJ Screw
This ain't friday night lights
But I got the infrared
Yeah and you already know
Beggers on the shoes
Big hulk came through

[Hook ]
Everybody out your seat
Bob your head to this
Real recognize real
We was bred for this
The dream is real
Don't tread on this
We live the dream
Don't tread on this
Everybody out your seat
Bob your head to this
Real recognize real
We was bred for this
The dream is real
Don't tread on this
We live the dream
Don't tread on this

[Verse 2]
See I'm a just do it like nike
Spit it so nicely
When I'm done some ain't gon' like me
I'm a try to say it politely
So I might come across a tad bit fiesty
Check my resume and see
What I've done
I'm official like the
Check on my AF1
From the slums
Raised off noth'n but crumbs
I don't want none
And look what I've become
Ahuh ahuh I'm a just keep it real
And my brother's ghetto dreams
Will be fulfilled
And on the field
Deuce gonna show his skills
Wheel to wheel for real
And so I feel
My balls are real
So home boy please
Don't tempt me
Or I'll cross you over like the
Great Clint Dempsey
The rhyme is simple so
Please don't tread on this
This is soccer and rap
With a screwed up twist

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Don't wake a sleeping giant
Unless you wanna see him pissed
Though I'm quick with my feet
You ain't seen the fist
It'd be a one hitter quitter
Then class dismissed
Better think twice before you
Try and tread on this
Games hard on the street
Cause with no shoes on their feet
Winning satisfies hunger
They don't need to eat
Yeah we came here to learn
But we're starting to teach
Cause we stood in the shadows
Now you can see
Haters wanna hate
But man I'm feeling great
Thanks to soccer
I'm around more ice
Then a hockey skate
More cash than's in a bank
No need for ya'll to rate
I done cut the yard
And threw the trash away
In the south we got the game on lock
More game than a game cock
In Texas we plead block
Straight close up shop
I'm gettin twisted
Steppin on rough
You think we trippin'?
Check the stats yourself

[Hook][Hook - 2x]
Try to understand, all the shit that I've been through
Try to understand, I got a life to live too
Try to understand, I got problems but I feel you
Try to understand, I'm a man I got bills too

[Pretty Todd]
I never give the devil the pleasure, to ever take a fella off of his level
Still, everything's right on schedule
I had my personal vendettas, but I solved em
Cause all that drama, could stop us from getting dollas
I take advice from one, and that's my mama
I made her a promise, my word is my honor
Cause sure enough, I'm a grown up
Just turned 21 there's money to get, and I'm trying to get me some
So get your ass out my path, 'fore you get mashed
Put a whole new career, in your new acts relapse
What we have, is organized grinding
In a mind of real niggas, our vision's a clear picture
I'm still with you, you ain't lost me I hope I ain't lost you
I just, had to get that out fool
And let niggas know, a lil' something about school
And struggle in this concrete, jungle I walk through

[Scooby]
I am dog, a grown man dog
You don't understand, the plan at hand dog
You see the potential, I mash to get cake
Hustle Presidential, like a Bad Azz Mix Tape
Say I live what I speak, so you best believe
I grind to what's left for me, is left in these streets
Listen up man, I mean with figgas
I don't know if it's just me, but all I see is green pictures
And I don't bother, with these in between niggas
Loyalty is my back bone, we the team nigga
G-R-I-T-B-O
Y-dolla sign, chump cause we need do'
Respect is power, and power is money
Money is time, money is the reason that I rhyme and grind
Might I remind you, that I'm designed to
Move anything out the way, of getting what's mine fool

[H.A.W.K.]
See the type of nigga I am, I give a good damn
Bout anything, other than fam
Just ten years ago, when I didn't have flow
Before You Already Know, when I didn't have do'
My mom's oldest seed, I had to take the lead
Dreams of making believe, became make believe
We was boys but we now men, ask once then you'll ask again
How many times, will I have to lend
You on the outside, looking in
You don't know where I done been, do anything to get in
I don't know how, some of you think
But soon as you blink, they here on the first and fifteenth
Now see I got bills too, feel me like you I feel you
God damn, I got a life too
Got a kid, and a wife too
And how the hell they gon eat, if I still gotta feed you

[Lil' Keke]
Follow the vision, and we can walk the road clear
I hustled and struggled, it was another long year
I never had a brother, so I turned to the thugs
No unconditional love, cause we ain't the same blood
Tough guys, most y'all niggas still bluffing
I'm thinking while I'm puffing, I don't owe you niggas nothing
I'm changing my ways, I'm living my life new
Nigga get your own thang, and see what your hustle do
I done heard it all nigga, guess I'm chasing a dream
Got a big family to feed, and I'm the coach of that team
If you the shit best believe, all the flies they love it
When the plan going bad, everybody say fuck it
And you recognize game, when the pain is felt
And it's one thang fa sho, I ain't gon lie to myself
So you busta ass niggas, can't see night from day
Understand black man, I got bills to pay

[Hook - 2x][It's a Big E beat]

[Intro: Bun B]
This is dedicated, to the legendary
DJ Screw

[Verse: 1 Bun B]
Now once upon a time not long ago
Where they come down candy, and live life low
Where the fours stay chromey, and they grippin' on wood
And people all behave like it's all to the good
Then came a young player from the Southside streets
Who had dreams of making music, with slowed down beats
He jumped on the tables made it do what it do
And so begins the legend of DJ Screw

[Hook]
(Scratched) This is dedicated to the legendary DJ Screw

[Verse 2: ESG]
Jeah
Six in the morning, Feds at my door
Quarter mil' on the floor, the city where everything shows
Yeah, still bang Screw, we love it mayne
I know he gone, but nothing changed
Hawk, P.A.T., M.O.E. they all above us, mayne
Down here he grind and hustle, mayne
Can't forget Chad Butler mayne
Still swang on 84's, a mirror-glass like buzzers mayne
Grab the Louie duffle man, S.U.C. still in this thing
I know my dog gone, Robert Davis, we gon' do it mayne

[Verse 3: C-Note]
See, I love this life
This is Screwed Up Click
Don't quote me, dog
You'll get screwed up quick
Still we blew one quick
My 84's, they stick
On 24's, we sit
You know we holdin' it, bitch
I'mma do this hit for Screw
For Hawk, for Pat
Even though we pushin' powder
But the trunk, be crack
C-Note reppin' S.U.C
R.I.P. to Jimmy T
Nigga, I'mma swang in the 'Lac
That's how it s'posed, to be

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
(Jeah)
One of the realest to do this shit
Used to Texas Screwed up, quick
Yeah, the tracks, Screw'll bring it back
No one better that you can get
For my nigga Robert Davis
Chop it up, Screw my shit
Now the true representation, making sure the world knew this shit
Every time you think of double cups, or swangers peekin' out the boards
Freestylin' off top of dome, or grills covered in ice and gold
Dealers salute the General, point-black, no subliminal
Tell 'em we Screwed up Texas, we go fed like a criminal

[Verse 5: Lil' O]
Here's a little story about a nigga like me
Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, nigga, S.U.C
South-west, H-Town, all of that's me
If a ho is cotton-mouth I wouldn't give a bitch P
I'm so Screwed up nigga say I talk slow
I say I listen fast when you niggas talk doe
And nah, I can't touch if the shit is not dro
If the drink is not purple, and the bitches no -whoa-

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Z-Ro]
Dark blue Regal, or a Screw Blue Impala
Helpin' everybody, that's what he used to with this dollars
No collars, just t-shirts and Dickies
Even though he had a lot to do
He was never too busy to come and get me
I'm really Screwed Up Click, Robert Earl Davis put me in
Not a friend of a friend of a friend, of a friend
I can see him spinnin' records in Heaven in all white
Like he used to do on 22-34 all night

[Verse 7: Big Hawk]
Niggas I feel that's talkin' shit
Niggas I feel that's ridin' dick
Talkin' down on the Screwed Up Click
They must don't know who they fuckin' wit'
5-Star General of the S.U.C
Want my clique, gotta go through me
Go through Key, and Mike. D
Then you gotta go through Big Pokey
Who you know a nigga hard as me?
Who you nigga know is smart as me?
Niggas wanna know how hard is he
I'm hard as the Baltimore Raven's D
Betcha ain't see, like a [?] real
Hardest nigga I feel, with no deal
Plowin' through niggas like a snowmobile
And I make beats that the real can feel

[Hook x2]What's up, this our new artist Quest
Check him out, sing the hook baby

[Hook: Quest - 2x]
Baby don't cry, I know you stressed out
Because I live the thug life
Ducking dodging cops, and selling drugs all night
I know it seems hard, but it'll be alright
Oooh, it's alright-i-ight

[Rod]
Steady paranoid eyes and gray skies, looking at the people in my life
Trying to read my mind, cause this world ain't treating me right
Barely sleeping at night, with so much stress and drama on my brain
Cause busting bitch ass niggas, want me out of the game
Now ain't that a shame, can't be real with niggas niggas ain't real
Can't put my trust in none of em, cause these niggas'll steal
And if I show 'em they stealing, they'd think a nigga tripping
But yet still they plot to catch a nigga slipping, pistol gripping
When my pockets itching, to stack money
Never thought my baby mama, would bitch and act funny
Walking round fat tummy, talking bout she pregnant for me
Then turn around, and say it's for a nigga named Deep
But I ain't tripping cause I got what I wanted, and let a head in some pussy
Always knew I was gone make it, so she's scared to overlook me
Therefor, I hope that nigga that you with walking by your side
But don't be looking all sad, bitch smile

[Hook - 2x]

[Rod]
I feel this world, is full of envy and greee-eeed
Suckas and bustas, all wanna witness me bleee-eding
I paid my dues to become rich, now these folks all up on my dick
They wanna hate cause we balling, on top of ours and they falling
I done spent too many pain, from struggling years
Behind and under, heavy rain blood sweat and my tears
All on my lonesome, I've been facing my fears
I see day to day problems, in the faces of my peers
No need to be greedy, cause I'm just trying to get what I'm worth
Before the people have us the hats, and wipe me off the face of the earth
And place me in dirt, brought up as a problem child
Going through so much drama, but I still smile

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
You know I'm thugging, not for a hobby it's just my life
It's gon be a hot minute, 'fore I find me a wife
I'm into short term relations, switching up situations
Always on the go, I hustle for occupation
Got them people watching, they trying to shatter my world
You's a major part of me, that's how I look at it girl
Get your mind right, it ain't no need for tears
I've been grinding getting this money, living dirty for years
When we lay chest to chest, you moan and say you love me
'Fore you fall asleep tonight, say another prayer for me
It's one honey, get the stress off your brain
I'm built to maintain, lil' mama just do your thang
I'm my own man, and I'ma do just what I can
Staying inside my character, sticking straight to the plan
As for me and you, I'm trying to keep it true
It's a struggle on the streets, but you're still my boo

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)
Yeah you know, this here just a lil'
Game for my real niggas out there getting it mayn, you understand me
You know, do whatever you gotta do to survive baby
But be safe in them streets mayn, well my nigga Keke

[Hook - 2x]
Hustle and hustle, till you can't no mo' (uh huh)
Hustle and hustle, till you can't no mo' (uh huh)
Hustle and hustle, till you can't no mo' (uh huh)
Hustle and hustle, till you can't no mo' (be safe in these streets)

[Lil' Head]
Whether it's nine to five, or either selling dope
You gotta get it how you live, just to stay afloat
By any means necessary, bitch get on your grind
Broke shit is punk shit, man it ain't lying
I been there I'm still here, and I'm trying to get out
And all my real niggas know, what I'm talking about
And street life, make a nigga not eat right
Losing sleep, and why you trying to stay up on feet right
Been in the game, for a real long time
I can't believe you motherfuckers, ain't respecting my rhyme
Can't believe you motherfuckers, ain't respecting mind
The year 0-4, I know you gon respect it this time
Cause I'm talking bout the real shit, I know you gonna feel this
Down South nigga, nope I ain't from the hills bitch
I'm from a place, where niggas the yellow
And yeah I'm from the Clarke, but I'm still stuck in the ghetto so I

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I hustle and hustle and, struggle and struggle and
Juggle and double and, stay out of trouble man
I am a hustler man, and I can't stop it
I'll rock for rock it, I want all the profit
Put it in my pocket, I'm sticking to the topic
Life is a hustle man, so can't nobody knock it
Hustle and hustle, till I can't no mo'
And I hustle and hustle, till my calves get so'
And I hustle and hustle, till I get all the do'
And it's a must when I hustle, I do it solo
Don't need no sidekicks, or niggas that ride dick
With that fly shit, and on the crew they really a snitch
Who the fuck you working with, the F-E-D's
H.P.D's, get up off my N-U-T's
You cats is wanna-be's, boy I do this to eat
Better listen to Lil' Head, be safe in these streets

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Take the good with the bad, respect it just like a man
It's still some mo' to fight, but losing ain't in the plan
Rocks and fry sticks, bricks and big licks
On to cut your stick, with the niggas you click with
The pyrex's shake, no mistakes and flakes
The bakery in the hood, serving cookies and cakes
So I hustle till I can't, I ain't just running my mouth
Ain't no future on the block, so I'm stretching my socks
I done set my price, I ain't gon change for the streets
Me and my workers got families, we both gotta eat
So I shake boys, you cowards just making noise
Life is still a struggle, I hustle and get it hard
For the fam, I don't give a damn that's who I am
Put the plates on the table, daddy gon bring the spam
Get your cash too fast, I'll be taking it slow
Gotta grind to get mine, till I can't no mo' whoa(*talking*)
Uh that's right, we back in the building nigga
Young Fever Presidential, 1-8-7 Presidential

[Hook - 2x]
Go on mix it up (yeah), go on twist it up
If you in the club fucked up, holla (hell yeah)
I'm talking Henn and Hypnotic, hydro and chronic
Mugging a motherfucker, screaming (we don't care)

[Kevo]
Hate me when I skate up to the club, with a bug on my wrist
Custom six overload, no Crys
I came to throw some bows and break a nose, where my bitches and sixes
I see you motherfuckers outside, whistling and tipsy
Bitch you bouncing with your mouth wide, and mix on your kidneys
I'm worser than Ike and Bobby, beating Tina and Whitney
I hold three X and dro, feeling oh so woozy
Popped a bag of broad at the bar, and gon bruise it
Who party like we do shit, nobody
My niggas in the club, from Saturday to Friday
Bum rush the bar, trample over feet
And to you niggas play it sweet, or get put to sleep
You gotta love it, when these niggas play corporate
Until that metal open up they chest, and they stop just forfeit
You don't want this desert eagle, in your face
And act like that drank on that bar, nigga stay in your place and

[Hook - 2x]

[Lyrical 187]
I'ma fall up in the place, with my mug twisted up
Straight shots of Henny, plenty hoes wanna fuck
Bitch niggas around me, with they nuts swolled up
This new nigga on the block, got your spot sewed up
1-8-7 the Lyrical Presidential, high roll
Put that diamond in your tooth, on the flo' (hell yeah)
We tear the club up, niggas throw your thug up
Bitches show your thong, acting like you scared take your ass home
I'm fucked up off dro and drank, calling niggas to the bank
Seeing how many gon ride, I see the panic in they eyes
You don't want no problems dog, I just came to chill with y'all
Show you how real niggas ball, they don't give a fuck
Three way pimp action, after hour in the Clutch
Slut chasing in the parking lot, dodging the butts
1-8-7, Young Fever and the H-A-Dub-K
Presidential, Ghetto Dreams and them boys don't play

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I'm at the club fucked up, in my pick-up truck
Fresh dressed, looking like a million bucks
I hit the dutch, then climb out the truck
Old school Chucks, walking with a gangsta strut
You can swear that I'm playing, for the Stanley Cup
I'm so iced up, just missing the hockey puck
I'm sipping on Hypnotic, feeling pshycotic
Good weed I got it, trying to see who bought it
Girls getting erotic, shaking ass and tits
They see a playa in the mix, so they jump on dick
Them girls so slick, with that famous rhyme
I ain't a groupie, I don't do this all the time
Lil' mama stop lying, cause I could really care less
I'm really not impressed, and all I want is sex
So baby what's next, are you going my way
Another notch on the belt, for the H-A-W-K

[Hook - 2x][Intro]

Don't need no sidekicks, or niggas that ride dick
With that fly shit, and on the crew they really a snitch
Who the fuck you working with, the F-E-D's
H.P.D's, get up off my N-U-T's
You cats is wanna-be's, boy I do this to eat
Better listen to Lil' Head, be safe in these streets

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Take the good with the bad, respect it just like a man
It's still some mo' to fight, but losing ain't in the plan
Rocks and fry sticks, bricks and big licks
On to cut your stick, with the niggas you click with
The pyrex's shake, no mistakes and flakes
The bakery in the hood, serving cookies and cakes
So I hustle till I can't, I ain't just running my mouth
Ain't no future on the block, so I'm stretching my socks
I done set my price, I ain't gon change for the streets
Me and my workers got families, we both gotta eat
So I shake boys, you cowards just making noise
Life is still a struggle, I hustle and get it hard
For the fam, I don't give a damn that's who I am
Put the plates on the table, daddy gon bring the spam
Get your cash too fast, I'll be taking it slow
Gotta grind to get mine, till I can't no mo' whoa[Intro: Big Hawk]
H.A.dub.K, hater proof
Kyle Lee, Robert Earl Davis
This is for you baby
Know what I’m saying

[Verse 1: Big Hawk]
In the turning lane, six CD change
Trunk full of bang like change then I swang
Smoking Mary Jane as I grip wood grain
It’s kinda hard to explain why I’m so off the chain
Still banging screw, riding candy blue
I don’t gang bang so I ride red too
Ever since 92 I’ve been screwed up
Syrup in my cup and that strawberry crush
Sitting on buck or sitting on grey
D to the A it’s the H.A.dub.K
Still to this day I’m still screw head
Even though screw dead I’m still doing what he said
Repping S.U.C repping P.A.T
Repping Mafio and Gata of patn’ me
What screw did for me, was real as can be
That’s why the whole world must know it’s legacy

[Chorus: ]
I’d rather bang screw while I’m on the block riding through my hood
Grey tape in the deck, while I’m sipping drank and smoking good
I’m talking bout that Pat and that S.U.C coming out my trunk
Or maybe E.S.G while I swang and bang to the ocean of funk

I’d rather bang screeew, yeee, know wha I’m saying
Said, I’d rather bang my screeeew, know wha im sayin x2

[Verse 2: Big Cease]
It gotta be slow down if it gone bang in my ride
I was raised in the tex and I rep it with pride
Grey tape in the deck of the slab at all times
RIP to the legend, true king of the south
Who would of thought back in 92
The whole world dripping candy and jamming Screw
I'm sure he knew it cause he started the movement
Slowing down the music now it’s all eyes on Houston
Pistol trolls sliding all the way slow
While I'm buried over gold, while I'm sipping on a 4
Peep the crops fader, make the beat studder
RIP to H.A.dub.K's brother
That’s the Fat P, haters won’t like me
When they see the DVD with Big Hawk and Kyle Lee
Big Cease I represent hater proof
And I done heard it all before but I’d rather bang screw

[Chorus: ]

[Verse 3: Kyle Lee]
I’ma screw head till I D.I.E
And I got ghetto dreams like P.A.T
Do you remember, creeping in my window
Month of September, riding foreign car in the winter
Throwed then a bitch, as the wood wheel twist
Diamonds on my fist, I’m leaning on a switch
Tipping on 4's, got candy on my doors
Diesel on my chest, banks on my toes
Don’t approach hoes, real players get chose
Classy L Vogues on my wide body loads
June 27th, whose next to plex
I’m a south side player from Screwston, Tex
Sitting sideways with the H.A.dub.K
On the highway blowing blueberry haze
Screw in the deck while I hogg the lane
Slow mo music is all I bang

[Chorus: ][It's a Big E beat]

[Intro: Bun B]
This is dedicated, to the legendary
DJ Screw

[Verse: 1 Bun B]
Now once upon a time not long ago
Where they come down candy, and live life low
Where the fours stay chromey, and they grippin' on wood
And people all behave like it's all to the good
Then came a young player from the Southside streets
Who had dreams of making music, with slowed down beats
He jumped on the tables made it do what it do
And so begins the legend of DJ Screw

[Hook]
(Scratched) This is dedicated to the legendary DJ Screw

[Verse 2: ESG]
Jeah
Six in the morning, Feds at my door
Quarter mil' on the floor, the city where everything shows
Yeah, still bang Screw, we love it mayne
I know he gone, but nothing changed
Hawk, P.A.T., M.O.E. they all above us, mayne
Down here he grind and hustle, mayne
Can't forget Chad Butler mayne
Still swang on 84's, a mirror-glass like buzzers mayne
Grab the Louie duffle man, S.U.C. still in this thing
I know my dog gone, Robert Davis, we gon' do it mayne

[Verse 3: C-Note]
See, I love this life
This is Screwed Up Click
Don't quote me, dog
You'll get screwed up quick
Still we blew one quick
My 84's, they stick
On 24's, we sit
You know we holdin' it, bitch
I'mma do this hit for Screw
For Hawk, for Pat
Even though we pushin' powder
But the trunk, be crack
C-Note reppin' S.U.C
R.I.P. to Jimmy T
Nigga, I'mma swang in the 'Lac
That's how it s'posed, to be

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
(Jeah)
One of the realest to do this shit
Used to Texas Screwed up, quick
Yeah, the tracks, Screw'll bring it back
No one better that you can get
For my nigga Robert Davis
Chop it up, Screw my shit
Now the true representation, making sure the world knew this shit
Every time you think of double cups, or swangers peekin' out the boards
Freestylin' off top of dome, or grills covered in ice and gold
Dealers salute the General, point-black, no subliminal
Tell 'em we Screwed up Texas, we go fed like a criminal

[Verse 5: Lil' O]
Here's a little story about a nigga like me
Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, nigga, S.U.C
South-west, H-Town, all of that's me
If a ho is cotton-mouth I wouldn't give a bitch P
I'm so Screwed up nigga say I talk slow
I say I listen fast when you niggas talk doe
And nah, I can't touch if the shit is not dro
If the drink is not purple, and the bitches no -whoa-

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Z-Ro]
Dark blue Regal, or a Screw Blue Impala
Helpin' everybody, that's what he used to with this dollars
No collars, just t-shirts and Dickies
Even though he had a lot to do
He was never too busy to come and get me
I'm really Screwed Up Click, Robert Earl Davis put me in
Not a friend of a friend of a friend, of a friend
I can see him spinnin' records in Heaven in all white
Like he used to do on 22-34 all night

[Verse 7: Big Hawk]
Niggas I feel that's talkin' shit
Niggas I feel that's ridin' dick
Talkin' down on the Screwed Up Click
They must don't know who they fuckin' wit'
5-Star General of the S.U.C
Want my clique, gotta go through me
Go through Key, and Mike. D
Then you gotta go through Big Pokey
Who you know a nigga hard as me?
Who you nigga know is smart as me?
Niggas wanna know how hard is he
I'm hard as the Baltimore Raven's D
Betcha ain't see, like a [?] real
Hardest nigga I feel, with no deal
Plowin' through niggas like a snowmobile
And I make beats that the real can feel

[Hook x2][Hook - 2x]
If you got plex, we can catch the square
Anytime any placer, any motherfucking where
Gutter ass niggas, and we don't play fair
Anytime any placer, any motherfucking where

[H.A.W.K.]
Any place anytime, I'll beat a bitch down
Push his face to the ground, then fill him up with rounds
See I don't fuck around, I terrorize the town
Sniff a hater out the pack, like a damn bloodhound
See a motherfucking hawk, don't hang with crows
I hang with the those I chose, who ain't scared to throw blows
On that Mike Tyson shit, that'll bite a earlobe
Bloody your nose, then scratch off on your vogues
I'm on that other shit, you better run for cover bitch
Or get hit with this, bear lethal fist
I must admit, that I heard some shit
That when you piss, you don't stand you sit
You's a bitch, and fucking with a grown ass man
I don't have to use a gun, I'm pretty good with my hands
Ask your man's he'll tell you, H.A.W.K. don't care
Anytime any place, any motherfucking where

[Hook - 2x]

[Mussilini]
Let the flame burn, burn baby burn
Caught him at that light, saying turn baby turn
Gutter ass niggas, and we don't play fair
Take a nigga life, or I pull a bitch hair
Step to the square, it'll be your last walk
Who is that Mussili', Lil' Ke and Big Hawk
Think before you talk, bitch you'll eat them words
Get hung from a tree, or get flipped off a curbed
Anytime any place, any spot anywhere
At night time in the noon or day, our niggas don't care
Flame spit at niggas we marvelous, to get you nigga ain't hard to us
These bitch niggas be fraud to us, we rich niggas in God we trust
We flip figgas and our broads stay up, step out of line you will get rushed
Crushed dick in the dust, have your homeboys picking you up
Plus flush enemies done, I be the one to be sick with the tongue
And the gun, G.I. Texas where I'm from leaving 'em hung

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Niggas consistently provoking, me to try to test mine
Come through your hood, with them killas and have you get down
CMG, I rep it hard on the streets mayn
We bust shit down, like a block of that cocaine
Let's do it dog, like them gangstas and soldiers
Let's get scarred up, knuckle up till it's over
The game is infected, niggas must respect it
We well connected, up in Texas
They better squash plexers, cause we never play fair
Dirty South young nigga, boys gutter out there
Hating and bullshitting, will get your family tied up
Texas and cowboys, the Penitentiary wired up
Got licks for plenty bricks, the prices are skied up
Catch the square anywhere, my click the size up
This Southside, and it's home of the crooks
Put my boxing gloves on, and take a look

[Hook - 2x]*Chorus* (Lil' O)[Hawk]

Ever seen a broad get drunk off hennesy on the rocks
Then I pop me and ex(extasy) now i'm fiening for cops
Thats when I notice her sholder staring at the gleam on my watch
Licking her lips rubbing her tits ooh you making me hot
She had a waist like a boss and neck like a hoss
And by the twich in her walk I knew she love when I floss
I whispered in her ear baby let me hit but first
You down to leave with a player she replied [of course]
Took her to the room and baby I was ramming her
Had her hitting off the wall showing stamina
My dick was eating up her pussy like an canibus
She was like [ooh Lil O you a animal]
Thats when I rolled her on her stomacje and I worked her caboose
Deep shots like three corners made her nut me some juice
Then she made her pussy squeeze had it grippin my goose
Made me bust about a gallon had to go and produce
Mann!

*Chorus*

(Big Hawk)
Missy freaky deaky I was watching you peep me
From the look in your eyes I can tell that you're sneaky
You're ready to eat me I know you hate to admit
I know you want it come and get it cause I been antious to hit
Girl i'm ready to rip I hear you love good sex
So I map out a plan like an artchitech
Ain't no name calling or no disrespect

When I dig I dig deep and make you grit your teeth
I'm a natural freak in between the sheets
But what you got between your legs girl I ain't gon eat
But you can suck the meat til i'm about to cum

My job is done I love the way you work the tongue

*Chorus*

Check him out, sing the hook baby

[Hook: Quest - 2x]
Baby don't cry, I know you stressed out
Because I live the thug life
Ducking dodging cops, and selling drugs all night
I know it seems hard, but it'll be alright
Oooh, it's alright-i-ight

[Rod]
Steady paranoid eyes and gray skies, looking at the people in my life
Trying to read my mind, cause this world ain't treating me right
Barely sleeping at night, with so much stress and drama on my brain
Cause busting bitch ass niggas, want me out of the game
Now ain't that a shame, can't be real with niggas niggas ain't real
Can't put my trust in none of em, cause these niggas'll steal
And if I show 'em they stealing, they'd think a nigga tripping
But yet still they plot to catch a nigga slipping, pistol gripping
When my pockets itching, to stack money
Never thought my baby mama, would bitch and act funny
Walking round fat tummy, talking bout she pregnant for me
Then turn around, and say it's for a nigga named Deep
But I ain't tripping cause I got what I wanted, and let a head in some pussy
Always knew I was gone make it, so she's scared to overlook me
Therefor, I hope that nigga that you with walking by your side
But don't be looking all sad, bitch smile

[Hook - 2x]

[Rod]
I feel this world, is full of envy and greee-eeed
Suckas and bustas, all wanna witness me bleee-eding
I paid my dues to become rich, now these folks all up on my dick
They wanna hate cause we balling, on top of ours and they falling
I done spent too many pain, from struggling years
Behind and under, heavy rain blood sweat and my tears
All on my lonesome, I've been facing my fears
I see day to day problems, in the faces of my peers
No need to be greedy, cause I'm just trying to get what I'm worth
Before the people have us the hats, and wipe me off the face of the earth
And place me in dirt, brought up as a problem child
Going through so much drama, but I still smile

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
You know I'm thugging, not for a hobby it's just my life
It's gon be a hot minute, 'fore I find me a wife
I'm into short term relations, switching up situations
Always on the go, I hustle for occupation
Got them people watching, they trying to shatter my world
You's a major part of me, that's how I look at it girl
Get your mind right, it ain't no need for tears
I've been grinding getting this money, living dirty for years
When we lay chest to chest, you moan and say you love me
'Fore you fall asleep tonight, say another prayer for me
It's one honey, get the stress off your brain
I'm built to maintain, lil' mama just do your thang
I'm my own man, and I'ma do just what I can
Staying inside my character, sticking straight to the plan
As for me and you, I'm trying to keep it true
It's a struggle on the streets, but you're still my boo

A nigga going pound for pound, until the blood is found
Snatch punks off the glass, like a Shaq rebound
Got more depth young clown, cause we rep H-Town
And we beat chumps down, at the lyricists lounge
I hit em high, regroup then go to the bottom
To his ass to his ribs, when he fold I got him
If he still sitting up, then we work that grill
Big judge young Don, serving raw and steel
To the gate to the finish, this for CMG
Another Ghetto Dreams, sponsored by S.U.C
Got big swoll nuts, and as a matter of fact

Oh..

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
Class is in session, I'ma spit with aggression
And if I feel threatened, you better call witness protection
Stop asking questions, five line connection
Well connected, jinks, whites, blacks and mexicans
7-1-3 nigga, armored Texans
In the three fo' deep, in my corner flexing
Intersection, young cats is fucking with veterans
Southside legends, killas that'll beat your head in
Pop the lead in, hit you in the stomach and head and
Pop your legs in, then straight leave you for dead and
Enough is said and, move it on down the field
Like the Kansas City Chiefs, and that Dick Vermeil
This shit is real, fuck how a nigga feel
We moving like a freight train, trying to get that scrill
I'm changing the game, with Don still changing lanes
And with both of our brains, all we see is change

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
The mic turn on, boy it's duck and cover
Another pen getting pimped man, by me and my brother
Never pimps my hand, cause I just don't love her
When I'm in the studio, I do it like nan-nother
And I'm one of a kind, they better find me a clone
And you sure right sticks and stones, they break bones
Rise like grits, when the shit get thick
Break em down so quick, sit him up on bricks

[H.A.W.K.]
I'ma hit all his licks, fuck all his chicks
Wondering how I done it, cause I flow so sick
Do the arithmetic, flow equals do'
And dope plus flow, equals the take your ho
CMG, is fucking what that Ghetto D
Trying to see, currency like Master P
S.U.C., Big H.A.W.K. and Don Ke
And with 20-20 vision, y'all still can't see

Mugging a motherfucker, screaming (we don't care)

[Kevo]
Hate me when I skate up to the club, with a bug on my wrist
Custom six overload, no Crys
I came to throw some bows and break a nose, where my bitches and sixes
I see you motherfuckers outside, whistling and tipsy
Bitch you bouncing with your mouth wide, and mix on your kidneys
I'm worser than Ike and Bobby, beating Tina and Whitney
I hold three X and dro, feeling oh so woozy
Popped a bag of broad at the bar, and gon bruise it
Who party like we do shit, nobody
My niggas in the club, from Saturday to Friday
Bum rush the bar, trample over feet
And to you niggas play it sweet, or get put to sleep
You gotta love it, when these niggas play corporate
Until that metal open up they chest, and they stop just forfeit
You don't want this desert eagle, in your face
And act like that drank on that bar, nigga stay in your place and

[Hook - 2x]

[Lyrical 187]
I'ma fall up in the place, with my mug twisted up
Straight shots of Henny, plenty hoes wanna fuck

This new nigga on the block, got your spot sewed up
1-8-7 the Lyrical Presidential, high roll
Put that diamond in your tooth, on the flo' (hell yeah)
We tear the club up, niggas throw your thug up
Bitches show your thong, acting like you scared take your ass home
I'm fucked up off dro and drank, calling niggas to the bank
Seeing how many gon ride, I see the panic in they eyes
You don't want no problems dog, I just came to chill with y'all
Show you how real niggas ball, they don't give a fuck
Three way pimp action, after hour in the Clutch
Slut chasing in the parking lot, dodging the butts
1-8-7, Young Fever and the H-A-Dub-K
Presidential, Ghetto Dreams and them boys don't play

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I'm at the club fucked up, in my pick-up truck
Fresh dressed, looking like a million bucks
I hit the dutch, then climb out the truck
Old school Chucks, walking with a gangsta strut
You can swear that I'm playing, for the Stanley Cup
I'm so iced up, just missing the hockey puck
I'm sipping on Hypnotic, feeling pshycotic
Good weed I got it, trying to see who bought it
Girls getting erotic, shaking ass and tits
They see a playa in the mix, so they jump on dick
Them girls so slick, with that famous rhyme
I ain't a groupie, I don't do this all the time
Lil' mama stop lying, cause I could really care less
I'm really not impressed, and all I want is sex
So baby what's next, are you going my way
Another notch on the belt, for the H-A-W-K

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)
Southside, the land of milk and honey baby
Real niggas getting money baby, respect that
Broke niggas, get somewhere only the strong survive
All about that paper baby, we want it

[H.A.W.K.]
Money by the tons, weed in my lungs
Switch blades and guns, niggas don't want none
This is the Dirty, the land of the birdie
Hustlers up early, getting they hands dirty
You heard me, yeah we get that do'
Sell out and resco', and then get some mo'
And also, we spit that amazing flow
Ask me what I'm hitting fo', I want ten a show

[Lil' Keke]
Niggas up in the gutter, they do it for white and butter
They stretching it like it's rubber, the ghetto a motherfucker
Ducking the undercover, FED's they trying to smother
Got taps up on your mother, your sister and baby brother
Working in closed do's, walking on tip toes
And these zeros, processing these kilos
Scratching for chips and cheddar, making a cookie buck
Gangstas up in the hood, we get it no matter what

[Hook - 2x]
When it's on in the hood, you feel it deep in your gut
Gangstas gon hold it down in the streets, no matter what
Packages by the hour, my nigga we get it early
Grind and get your cash, this how we do it in the Dirty

[H.A.W.K.]
This right here, gon squash all the rumors
Satisfy consumers, and cause some brain tumors
Our boy's a late bloomer, but now of excel
Local to worldwide, expanding like Nextel
Niggas hoping I fail, but I raise hell
In the shit I sell, quickly moves off the shelves
I'm a hood nigga, up to no good nigga
Hood nigga, I wish you would nigga
Eleven-nine-eleven, nigga that's what's up
I'm strolling the cut, pinky suits and all black Chucks
You gotta have nuts, cause gangstas gon hold it down
Saturating the town, white tan or brown
Bricks of pounds, you bumping get hit with rounds
Kicked around, fuck around and get beat down
Cause it's money to be made, on my side of town
If you ain't getting money, you better move around

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Niggas out here faking, and hating on my ability
All type of weapons and guns, in facility
Niggas out here bumping they gums, it's really killing me
Gangstas representing in the hood, I know you feeling me
Off top, this how the work gon get handled
Snatching from the po', when they cross the ship channel
Quick nigga, and I ain't got time to think
Only dates matter now, it's the first and fifteenth
And it's casualties in war, ain't no friends in money
Everybody's all good, when the days is sunny
But I'm a G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Multiply and add, trying to raise up my pay
This one for the fam, so I hold shit down
Worldwide round the globe, but it's still H-Town
This is for the hustlers, I know you heard me
Wrecking 2K4, straight up out the Dirty

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)
Uh yeah, I told you niggas I had PS2 clarity on tracks
It's Young Fever and Worm, the million dollar connection
Uh you fucking with Presidential, Commission Music Group
And most of all Ghetto Dreams baby, how you think about that one uh

[Hook]
Presidential, ain't nothing to be fucked with
Commission Music, ain't nothing to be fucked with
Ghetto Dreams, ain't nothing to be fucked with
You come playing games with us, you out of luck bitch
Presidential, ain't nothing to be fucked with
Commission Music, ain't nothing to be fucked with
Ghetto Dreams, ain't nothing to be fucked with
You come playing games with us, goodbye

[Kevo]
I always had a vision, that I would count cash like the government
A attitude like they like it, I'm fucking loving it
I never fronted niggas on credit, cancel that brother shit
Hover around another strip playa, you on that other shit
If there's cash outside my set, then I'ma cover it
Beef I put that shit off in the skillet, and smother it
I promised myself to love, not a nan 'nother bitch
I'm a pimp, I will make a ho house out of covenant
Niggas fuck around with Fever, and Kevo gon thump ya
In all black, pop right out of the hedges and bump ya
I rack stats and shots and assists, like original Rucker
Your destination is hell, cause heaven don't want ya
They gon find you with your body in the car, head in a dumpster
Hate the flame or the game, cause it plays in a monster
Slapped off, 151 and Mamosa
Ready to make my hollow points, hop out of your head like a toaster

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
With a full head of steam, and a hell of a team
Ghetto Dreams, is a money making machine
I'm chasing a dream, like Karl Malone chasing a ring
By any means, a must that I get this cream
Get that do', and spit that sickening flow
The C.E.O., and you ought to see me flow
You Gusto, the dude from CB4
And with that flow, your shit won't make it out the sto'
On tracks I'm a creature, I'm a smashing feature
Feel these hard 16's, coming through your speakers
I can teach ya, every aspect of the game
From putting it all together, to putting it in them chains
I'm talking change, in large amounts
Coming straight from the streets, to them corporate accounts
That's what counts, and any nigga willing to bet
Who the hell said a thug, can't be an exec

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
Commission Music, call me the franchise player
Touring city to city, with my C's in the air
Done seen plenty battles, 'fore I came out the hood
And I still lead my team, like a quarterback should
And we ain't to be fucked with, we worser than S.W.A.T
Every year two or three niggas, on the streets get shot
It's the Young Don nigga, on a hell of a job
Thanks to C.M.G. bitch, we the new black mob
This for the family, so it's mostly for wealth
I started my own label, then I signed myself
You know the street sweepers sweep, on a late night creep
One thang about a killer, he bring it just where you sleep
And it's 7-1-3, my nigga we still holding now
Still pimping bitches, my game is called polar bear
Multiplying game, get cash any and everywhere
Busting off talk, my pistol play is never fair

[Hook](*talking*)
Damn hear it baby, rep it
Can't fold, yeah uh-huh yeah
Yeah ok, what a nigga would say
If you ain't feeling this, you ain't touching it right

[Big Pokey]
Speed coat one week, next week chinchillas
Speed boat one day, next day three wheeler
A nigga don't play, and I'm all about my pay
Until I get it that way, I'ma be a gorilla
I put pistols in niggas pillows, and change they mind
Make niggas feel it for real, when they playing with mine
Ain't no sense in playing around, nothing ass niggas
Weighing you down, check em off nigga stay on your grind
Ask God for signs, and follow the guidelines
Sometime, you gotta set your pride on the sidelines
Strapped in the field, one shot one kill
One drop one live, say something gotta give
Lot of niggas be hating, but don't know what it is
Keep your eyes on the prize, and a extra pair of ears
If a nigga square it off, then you gotta tear him off
Crock bull bloodline, I roll like ouijas

[Hook]
Stop bullshitting with life, and pick up the pace
Fuck bill money dog, I'm trying to fill up a safe
I started from the ground, and I'm coming for my crown
Niggas wanna see me down, give a nigga some space
I go hard, round for round niggas can get it
In the yard, pound for pound nigga we hit it
Six digits, we spending that at the lot
That's what it's all about, paper chasing

[Lil' Keke]
Earth wind fire, is what I breathe
And receive in my lungs, I'm leaving the world sprung
I'm the Young Don, the streets turned me rotten
I ain't never had nothing, I surface straight from the bottom
You claim you a man, then nigga time to show it
If the fam on the line, then nigga I'd die for it
Concrete soldier, rocks and gate jumping
28 young, I'm still looking for some'ing
It's dirt plus work, when I'm rolling lonely
The 4-5 cocked, and my son is hungry
I stand up and slice the turkey, on Thanksgiving
I'm a entertainer, I show out for a living
In the booth with the truth, I be constant spitting
Ain't no lying to myself, I know when I'm bullshitting
Miss me, cause I'll smash on a hater
Out the do' on a go, I'm running after my paper

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
It's either get money, or be broke with no hope
Strung out on dope, with no way to cope
See us black folks, are so materialistic
Looking good but broke, with no way to fix it
Let's be realistic, and look at statistics
Without no do', we can't make no business
See I wanna be the richest, cause I came from nothing
I'm a greedy motherfucker, you could say I'm a glutting
Fuck bill money, I'm trying to get real money
Real money, that major deal money
That house, on a hill money
Put some food in my son's tummy, cause that's all that he wants from me
And what he want, he sho' gon get
Cause my daddy didn't give me shit, shit
Life's a bitch, and then you're gone
So while you here get your hustle on, get your hustle on

[Hook][Hook - 2x]
Try to understand, all the shit that I've been through
Try to understand, I got a life to live too
Try to understand, I got problems but I feel you
Try to understand, I'm a man I got bills too

[Pretty Todd]
I never give the devil the pleasure, to ever take a fella off of his level
Still, everything's right on schedule
I had my personal vendettas, but I solved em
Cause all that drama, could stop us from getting dollas
I take advice from one, and that's my mama
I made her a promise, my word is my honor
Cause sure enough, I'm a grown up
Just turned 21 there's money to get, and I'm trying to get me some
So get your ass out my path, 'fore you get mashed
Put a whole new career, in your new acts relapse
What we have, is organized grinding
In a mind of real niggas, our vision's a clear picture
I'm still with you, you ain't lost me I hope I ain't lost you
I just, had to get that out fool
And let niggas know, a lil' something about school
And struggle in this concrete, jungle I walk through

[Scooby]
I am dog, a grown man dog
You don't understand, the plan at hand dog
You see the potential, I mash to get cake
Hustle Presidential, like a Bad Azz Mix Tape
Say I live what I speak, so you best believe
I grind to what's left for me, is left in these streets
Listen up man, I mean with figgas
I don't know if it's just me, but all I see is green pictures
And I don't bother, with these in between niggas
Loyalty is my back bone, we the team nigga
G-R-I-T-B-O
Y-dolla sign, chump cause we need do'
Respect is power, and power is money
Money is time, money is the reason that I rhyme and grind
Might I remind you, that I'm designed to
Move anything out the way, of getting what's mine fool

[H.A.W.K.]
See the type of nigga I am, I give a good damn
Bout anything, other than fam
Just ten years ago, when I didn't have flow
Before You Already Know, when I didn't have do'
My mom's oldest seed, I had to take the lead
Dreams of making believe, became make believe
We was boys but we now men, ask once then you'll ask again
How many times, will I have to lend
You on the outside, looking in
You don't know where I done been, do anything to get in
I don't know how, some of you think
But soon as you blink, they here on the first and fifteenth
Now see I got bills too, feel me like you I feel you
God damn, I got a life too
Got a kid, and a wife too
And how the hell they gon eat, if I still gotta feed you

[Lil' Keke]
Follow the vision, and we can walk the road clear
I hustled and struggled, it was another long year
I never had a brother, so I turned to the thugs
No unconditional love, cause we ain't the same blood
Tough guys, most y'all niggas still bluffing
I'm thinking while I'm puffing, I don't owe you niggas nothing
I'm changing my ways, I'm living my life new
Nigga get your own thang, and see what your hustle do
I done heard it all nigga, guess I'm chasing a dream
Got a big family to feed, and I'm the coach of that team
If you the shit best believe, all the flies they love it
When the plan going bad, everybody say fuck it
And you recognize game, when the pain is felt
And it's one thang fa sho, I ain't gon lie to myself
So you busta ass niggas, can't see night from day
Understand black man, I got bills to pay

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)
South-Sive, the young Don
You motherfucking right, I'm back man
H-A-W-K, my motherfucking big brother
This for the late great Fat Pat
DJ Screw baby, you did it
You started this monster man, ha-ha

[Lil' Keke]
We did that, just to prove a point
When we in the vocal booth, we'll crash the joint
Another callabo, reaching for mo' do'
Geeking and spitting flow, teaching a weak ho
Let me go, I drop raps a mile a minute
Done six hundred thousand, local and independent
Boys see me flow, but they can't see me do'
Cutting out the middle man, when you the CEO
I mash and get crunk, and do it for Corey Blunt
Take a two week trip, throw fifty up out the trunk
Mastermind, take it to another level
Basically I'm saying, that I'm platinum in the ghetto
Fuck a major deal, we get nine a pop
Pressing up seventy thousand, everytime we drop
Release six a year, you do the math
I'ma stay in the studio, and let you hear the slab

[Hook: Lil Keke & (H.A.W.K.) - 2x]
We did this, just to let you niggas know
(mic check straight wreck, when we come with the flow)
Representing, for the S.U.C
(coldest lyricists, in the 7-1-3), hey

[H.A.W.K.]
7-1-3, is the area code
7-45, is how I hog the road
24/7 nigga, I stay blowed
And all the hoes say H.A.W.K., is thoed
It's the great one, brother of the late one
The straight one, when I bust with this gun
Don't hate son, cause the flow is polish
Never went to college, but still blessed with knowledge
Never had a major deal, and don't even want it
I just flex my skill, and crush my opponent
However you want it, I bring it hard to the rack
And y'all must forgot, I got platinum placks
And that's a fact, the next best thing to crack
To hear one of my songs, you gotta ring it back
Rewind that shit, get off in your mind and shit
The kid is sick, and I love the way he spit

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
We spit this rap, and drive this map
Then I kick this flow, and go for mo'
Then I let you niggas know, that I don't play
Smoke this light green, everyday
I'm on my way, me and my nigga Big Hawk-y
Across the water, alert the Nextel walkie
Young Don, and they just can't see
Another cold nigga, from the 7-1-3

[H.A.W.K.]
Ke hit me on the walkie, so I hit him back
Did you hear what we did, to that Worm track
We did that, boys better back on back
Or I'll react, and dominate just like Shaq
H.A.W.K. and the Don, really we don't barre none
We the shit, and y'all mo'fuckers the runs
Here we come, so y'all better move around
It's the 7-1-3, bout to shut shit down

[Hook - 2x]
