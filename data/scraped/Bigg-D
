[Intro: Ludacris]
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip lip lips
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip lip lips

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I ain't afraid to drown, if that means I deep up in your ocean yeah
Girl I'll drink you down, sipping on your body all night
I just wanna take your legs and wrap 'em round
Girl you're cumming right now
My head to your chest feeling your heart beat girl
Swimming all in your sea, and you're sweating all over me, bring it forward don't you run
I don't want to be a minute man
Baby you're just like a storm raining on me girl you're soaking wet, whoa

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma kiss it right, yeah, yeah, I'm gon' lick all night, yeah, yeah, girl when I'm inside, yeah, yeah
Yeah girl you heard what I said, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'mma put your legs behind your head when I make you wet the bed

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You don't know what you're in for, 'bout to get inside your mental
Bend ya back like it's limbo, I'mma make you feel like a nympho
Tonight, oh whoa, you're mine, baby girl
Any time you want it, I'm, ready and willing girl to give it
I start to lick your body you go to trembling, flip it around girl lemme get it from the side
And can I visit all those spots you like?
Your neck, your back, your sexy lips booty and thighs
I don't want to be a minute man
Baby you're just like a storm raining on me girl you're soaking wet

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'mma make your body wetter than ever, we'll get together you can tell as soon as I approach ya
When you're feeling up tight, get it right, don't fight lighten up like Sammy Sosa
Women call me the super soaker and I'mma soak ya bed to death
How long can you hold your breath?
Asthma attacking, wake up wondering what happened
Making me hot like Toni Braxton, you can't deny you wanna break my back in, two
What you wanna do, look at you with your birthday suit suit suit suit suit
The forecast said it's cloudy tonight and I'mma have your body like bloop bloop bloop bloop

[Chorus][Verse 1]
Bring the crowd and I'm loud in living color
It is Weezy Fuckin' Baby, got these rappers in my stomach
Yummy, I'm takin' it I ain't asking them for nothing
If you sell a million records we can battle for ya' money
I rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin' baby yes I'm still flossin
Latest car on the market wit the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a lil bulky
You look a lil salty have ya self a chill coffee
Chill out, the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out
I'm busy I got paper to reel in
God I hope they snappin' at the end of my rod
And I hope I'm fishing in the right pond
And I hope you catchin' on to every line
Who am I?

[Hook]
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
Swagger right, check, game tight
And they gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
Swagger right, check, game tight
And you should be afraid be very afraid

[Verse 2]
The heart of New Orleans
Thumpin' and beatin'
Livin' and breathin'
Stealin' and feedin'
Peelin' and leavin'
Killin' and grievin'
Dearly departed, erased/deleted
No prints, no plates
No face, no trace
Out of sight, out of mind
No court, no case
Sell his chain, celebrate, block party, second line
Zulu Ball, Essence Fest, Jazz Fest, Mardi Gras
Shorty bounce body rock
Now he dropped, now he got
Family try tell the feds tell the cops
Smell the rat comin' back to the house
To the spot tap tap knock knock who is dat
(Chi-chick! Pow!) trigga man, hoodie man, tell the kids
Boogie man pistol pete ammo mammal gun man blum blam!
Damn Sammie you dun' fucked up
Pussy ass niggas put ya' nuts up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck up wit all these rookie MCs

Fuck Em!
Fuck 'em good fuck long fuck 'em hard
Fuck who? Fuck 'em all
Yeah, like dat jus like dat
I'm right back
I'm on dat money train and the mac'll knock 'em off track
The quarterback well protected from the Warren Sapp
The young heart attack, I spit that cardiac
You can't see me baby boy you got dat cataracts
I'm right here straight out the hood jus like an alley cat
Since everyone's a king, where the fuckin' palace at?
Me? I got callous on my hand, I can handle dat
It's no problem, baby I so got 'em
It's just a victory lap baby, I'm jus joggin'
And I ain't even out of breath
The motherfuckin' best yet - sorry for cussing
Who?

[Hook][Intro:]
Helloooooooooooooo!!!!!!!! Brooklynnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Hello Brooklyn, how you doing?
Where you going? And can I come too?
And If I can, I'm a be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars, and drive me crazy
Wherever you going baby girl just take me
Cause I'm so taken, if you taken
I'm just saying baby I'm just saying

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Like a mama you birth me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you'd murk me, by the time I was twenty one
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'm a call her, Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend ya
Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much I bought extra
So much so the dinners now turn into breakfast
I only roll Lexus, to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne] (Jay-Z)
Hello Brooklyn, what's your story?
She said she eating on the run but she ain't N.O.R.E
She said she got a man but he ain't worried
But baby I'm a have to rob him like Horry
She said she love B.I.G. and she like 2Pac
And when I said Jay-Z she said "It's The Roc!"
And I'm a leave it like this, like this like that
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Have you seen her?
And when she tell you something you better believe her
She told me she like my New Orleans demeanor
And so I said goodbye Katrina, and hello Brooklyn
But baby you are, the sweetest sight eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, b-b-baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time (Time) place (Place) and the weather
On the day you said hi to me and let's say hello Brooklyn

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Brooklyn you crazy, look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth walking 'round behaving
All demented black hoodies and Timberlanded
Always scheming "you see the gleam on that niggas pendant?"
Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude
It says my life's too real, check out my ice grill
Baby I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville
But my Bed's in the Stuy so while I flatten your bush
Till we smoke a C.I. what up to the boy B.I
You know I handle B.I. I don't half-step on the 'caine
Ask the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan so?
She like it hardcore, So I grind slow
Iller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0
My fine ho we got some victims to catch
So in a couple years baby I'mma bring you some Nets

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And hello Brooklyn, but but baby you are, the sweetest thing eyes could see
Hello Brooklyn, baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are, so damn fine to me
But I remember the time, place, and the weather on the day you said goodbye to me[Hook]
I wanna get down, down, down, down
Down, Down, Down
Get Down
We can get down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh...Mr. West is in the building
Children, Ladies
Call the shrink up, they about to go crazy
Hold your drinks up, like you was celebrating
Hold your guns, if they is hella hating
I'm so clean and them, they got rabies
I can see them through the lens of my Raybe-
Ans, Wayfarers...MmmHmm
'Ye do you play fair? MmmNnnn
Grab your remote, for the reason they made Tivo
Snap your Nikon's with the icons with Nike's on
I heard you like to do it with the lights on
But I really make babies when the mics on
Check out all my kids, that bought all my cribs
Got me out of that apartment
You have got to pardon him
I am so retarded with a spit like a retarded kid that spits
Ooops, I ain't mean to say that shit
I told my homie Chris, these chicks is dangerous
You need a girl that's A List
Not one that's just barely made it on a list
Cause from Wall To Wall
We got it poppin' right now
Its a hundred girls, try to get down down down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, gotta tell you
Seen you somewhere before
You look familiar
You had a red shirt, Dickie slacks, and a Gucci bag to match it
Tell me you remember that baby girl
But lady never mind that
Can I take you out later?
And here's my contact
Can you do me this favor?
Can you spend this paper?
Only you cause its just sitting and lets just get it and go

[Bridge]
Let me, let me
Guarantee, guarantee)
I'll make your day
Okay!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
The way I see it girl, You a perfect ten
That's why I'm all on you baby
You got me wondering
What to do, what to say
Don't want to come off lame
Girl do you gotta man?
Better yet girl, what's your name?

[Bridge]

Now if you hit it
Shawty, shawty
Let me, let me
Take you better way
Baby can we dream, just for today?

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, I used to care so much what people thought about me
Now I really could give a fuck
Not when I own over $15 million in real estate
And bought all the Fast & Furious trucks, haha
See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows
See the Bridges Family values on the south side
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta house, why?
I'm not married, I've never been engaged
But your dumb-ass believes whatever's on the front page
See some of these bloggers don't even believe their own lies
Turn the computer screen into a mirror, look at'cha own lives
Cause technology exceeds all humanity
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity
Now private pics on my private, no longer private, man
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane

[Hook: John Legend]
Ohhh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'm a be alright, I'm a be alright
Let me live 'til I die

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I'm doing interviews
Getting asked the same questions from 10 years ago
Wondering to myself what the fuck I'm there for
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport
That repetition will drive any human being nutty
I'd rather be in my own crib, on my own couch
Thinking I gotta do what the fuck I wanna do money
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do
Soon as you get some money, it's gon' be someone with more than you
Sci-Fi movies, the fans said this album is overdue
And if you don't put some music out
These niggas gon' be over you
Talking about where that old Luda, for the rapper's sake
But Ursher told me if I don't evolve I'll evaporate
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen
If you're smart, and went to college better use your intuition

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
They said I'm so visual, they overlook the lyrics
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
Then steer it in the direction of your memory
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries
Wrote a song for my girl she couldn't stand straight
My man said, "don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base"
I said, "man, my female fan base gon' be here for forever"
Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth
And I ain't scared of shit except God in a life or jail suit
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answered everything that I prayed for

[Hook x2][Intro]
Weed and syrup, yeah
Who we is? Young Mooolah, baby!
Got that right shorty
Bigg D on the track!

[Hook]
I'm just, staring at the world
From a Cadillac window, baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don't act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I'm ready to perform and she's gon' be my audience
And she said "Bravo"
And I said "I know"
And she said "Encore"
Girl, I'm really big on you
So what you wanna do?
Too fly you need a parachute
But that just means you're falling in love

[Verse 1]
In love with a skater
Five six seven, man, I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of Uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when she gave me a hug
Shorty got me open
Pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Where your mans at?
Remember me like this one time at band camp, yeah!
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Hey, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine and then I drink a tall glass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girl you gon' make me take you
To your desired destination
Left leg, right leg, segregation
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that's my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I'm there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like she stole something
And she so fine
From the front from the side from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I'mma fuck you till you whine

[Hook][Intro: Wale}
Folarin, Double M, G
Slip N' Slide collabo
Let's get it!

[Verse 1: Wale]
What you talking bout?
Know I’ve been to Roma
Well let me call you out
When you put your crown
You got a little style
Let me put it down
Until you walking on the cloud
Look, the time’s now, I’m intrigued
Whenever I browse
I’ll be sure you get things
Yeah, see what I did there
Slip inside of her body
Until she get there

[Hook: Sebastian Mikael]
I can't lie, when I
Watch my baby
Her lip gloss pop, just came from the spot
Hair done too
But girl that was four shots ago
Now you can't believe
That you didn't feel me
Cause you wasn't sayin' that last night

[Verse 2: Sebastian Mikael]
Girl, I swear to God
People pay for a smile likes yours
And I'm loving it, cheaa (and I'm loving it, I'm loving it)
Girl, I swear to God
They'll pay for ass like yours if it wasn't there, yeah, yeah
(and I'm rubbing it, I'm rubbing it)

[Pre Hook: Sebastian Mikael]
You wanna know if we can make this confidential
Between me and you
(we already did it)
Between me and you
(we already did it)
Remember when I said
I'm tryna find something to get into
I was talkin' 'bout you
(we already did it)
I was talking about you, you, you, you, you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
This ain’t real baby
What they talking bout
Ain’t no rapper that’s alive call Folarin out
Now can you deal with it?
I’ll probably win you out
Cause I never tell a woman
Where my body call
Lemme tell 'bout last night
I don't remember much of last night
How I can say it keeping it polite
Ummmm, you left once, but she came twice
So get it right

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sebastian Mikael]
I swear to God
And I promise I won't tell nobody
Your privacy is safe with me
(and I'm loving it, I'm loving it)
Girl I swear to God
I wanna get plenty time to touch you
(and I'm rubbing it, I'm rubbing it)

[Pre Hook][Verse 1]
Bring the crowd and I'm loud in living color

That's 10-4. You don't know what your in for
What's in store is my new album but I can never save them
Fuck your bitch. Like Swade, I never page them
I am the best and anybody try to battle me
And if they tryna diss, I be like, "Oh, how flattering."
Nobody's on my level. Your girlfriend dig me without a shovel
I do not give a fuck cause I am hotter than the devil
The best rapper alive, Deezy
Tryna tell you niggas, to be me, it's not easy
Yeah, no disrespecting to Weezy
But call up John Cena and get some lessons to see me
Really, it's a blessing to see me
And they ask who's the greatest. There's no question, it's Deezy
I am...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rockstar status. Still the Shawty Magnet
Couldn't see me, you little faggots. 10-4, y'all some maggots
Y'all is on the ground. Please believe, it's going down
Yes, I am King Deezy, bitch. Hand me my crown
Tell them bow down. I'm representing Chi-Town
And I'm never your homie cause y'all some motherfucking clowns
Yeah, SMB is who I pound
Yeah, I rep them 'til I'm in the ground
Shoutout to Typhoon, Shane Lee, and Star Miller
Yung Trigga, C-Note. All them niggas my niggas
Shoutout to Young Flash. Shoutout to Luey V
Shoutout to RJC. Shoutout to $murf Da Beast
Really, it pays to see me
I been the best rapper alive since me and Swade was beefing

And if you don't put some music out
These niggas gon' be over you
Talking about where that old Luda, for the rapper's sake
But Ursher told me if I don't evolve I'll evaporate
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen
If you're smart, and went to college better use your intuition

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
They said I'm so visual, they overlook the lyrics
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
Then steer it in the direction of your memory
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries
Wrote a song for my girl she couldn't stand straight
My man said, "don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base"
I said, "man, my female fan base gon' be here for forever"
Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth
And I ain't scared of shit except God in a life or jail suit
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answered everything that I prayed for

[Hook x2][Intro: Rick Ross]
Yeah! Pussies don't get pussy
Brooklyn (uh-huh)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Kinda short, dark-skinned, she a fly lil' bitch
Be up in all them clubs spillin Dom P and shit
Know the boy stunt, Jonathan Kelsey clutch
Yves Saint Laurent fronts on her bags to the pumps
D's love her aura, Balenciago fedora
Lame niggas bore her, struttin like she Kimora
She'll take a kilo and stuff it up in the coochie
Brick of that raw, stash it between her coochie (ha ha)
Breeze through the hood, niggas treat her like a O.G
First bitch in the hood with the Bentley Coupe GT (yes)
Brooklyn is the team, Alexander McQueen
Bustin down a bird and balance it with a beam
5'5", slanted eyes, bitch walk is mean
Mahushi Ron bracelets and Armani jeans
They're called skinny, my bitch is like a rasta with it
Black car, red bottoms, only mobster in it

[Chorus: Foxy Brown] (x2)
It's like damn, bitch niggas lovin me now
'09 Bonnie & Clyde doin it now - whoa
Murder murder, these bitches ain't never heard of
Gettin money, gettin hurt up, impatient to leak them burners

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown]
Aiyyo Ross, send them bitches to the boss
The blood claat flyest bad bitch in New York
Y'all hoes better bow the fuck down and pay homage
I'm ten million sold and that's SoundScan knowledge
And all y'all rat bitches sound garbage
While me and Ross like the hood version of bombings
Bars keep me stylin from Giuseppe to Marblonyx
The .38 special in my Chanel stockings
Now that I got the llama and the Hermes duffel
Word to fly silver Fox, keep you stompin, who above me?
The dries, Stan Noten pumps, Nickelus Curt with platform
So ladies raise your glass to this mad song

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Money ain't a thing, just look at my pinkie rings
So many numbers in the bank, shit could never be the same
Tall four Velours, withdrawals by Michael Kors
And I watch a pretty penny I'm talkin hundred or more
My critique for 'leet, not for the cheap
And my money in the street way longer than my receipt
Dealin with the money, no (Monie) all (In The Middle)
I'm dealin with who owe me, opponents, they gettin riddled
Box niggas up, on the ropes
Louis sneakers, Louis luggage, the colognes and soaks
Smellin like money, my body tatted with hundreds
Oh-nine Bonnie & Clyde, gotta live with it like uh

[Chorus]

[Outro: Magazeen][Intro]
Weed and syrup, yeah
Who we is? Young Mooolah, baby!
Got that right shorty
Bigg D on the track!

[Hook]
I'm just, staring at the world
From a Cadillac window, baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don't act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I'm ready to perform and she's gon' be my audience
And she said "Bravo"
And I said "I know"
And she said "Encore"
Girl, I'm really big on you
So what you wanna do?
Too fly you need a parachute
But that just means you're falling in love

[Verse 1]
In love with a skater
Five six seven, man, I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of Uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when she gave me a hug
Shorty got me open
Pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Where your mans at?
Remember me like this one time at band camp, yeah!
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Hey, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine and then I drink a tall glass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girl you gon' make me take you
To your desired destination
Left leg, right leg, segregation
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that's my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I'm there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like she stole something
And she so fine
From the front from the side from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I'mma fuck you till you whine

[Hook][Intro: Ludacris]
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip lip lips
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip lip lips

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I ain't afraid to drown, if that means I deep up in your ocean yeah
Girl I'll drink you down, sipping on your body all night
I just wanna take your legs and wrap 'em round
Girl you're cumming right now
My head to your chest feeling your heart beat girl
Swimming all in your sea, and you're sweating all over me, bring it forward don't you run
I don't want to be a minute man
Baby you're just like a storm raining on me girl you're soaking wet, whoa

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma kiss it right, yeah, yeah, I'm gon' lick all night, yeah, yeah, girl when I'm inside, yeah, yeah
Yeah girl you heard what I said, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'mma put your legs behind your head when I make you wet the bed

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You don't know what you're in for, 'bout to get inside your mental
Bend ya back like it's limbo, I'mma make you feel like a nympho
Tonight, oh whoa, you're mine, baby girl
Any time you want it, I'm, ready and willing girl to give it
I start to lick your body you go to trembling, flip it around girl lemme get it from the side
And can I visit all those spots you like?
Your neck, your back, your sexy lips booty and thighs
I don't want to be a minute man
Baby you're just like a storm raining on me girl you're soaking wet

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'mma make your body wetter than ever, we'll get together you can tell as soon as I approach ya
When you're feeling up tight, get it right, don't fight lighten up like Sammy Sosa
Women call me the super soaker and I'mma soak ya bed to death
How long can you hold your breath?
Asthma attacking, wake up wondering what happened
Making me hot like Toni Braxton, you can't deny you wanna break my back in, two
What you wanna do, look at you with your birthday suit suit suit suit suit
The forecast said it's cloudy tonight and I'mma have your body like bloop bloop bloop bloop

[Chorus][Intro: Wale}
Folarin, Double M, G
Slip N' Slide collabo
Let's get it!

[Verse 1: Wale]
What you talking bout?
Know I’ve been to Roma
Well let me call you out
When you put your crown
You got a little style
Let me put it down
Until you walking on the cloud
Look, the time’s now, I’m intrigued
Whenever I browse
I’ll be sure you get things
Yeah, see what I did there
Slip inside of her body
Until she get there

[Hook: Sebastian Mikael]
I can't lie, when I
Watch my baby
Her lip gloss pop, just came from the spot
Hair done too
But girl that was four shots ago
Now you can't believe
That you didn't feel me
Cause you wasn't sayin' that last night

[Verse 2: Sebastian Mikael]
Girl, I swear to God
People pay for a smile likes yours
And I'm loving it, cheaa (and I'm loving it, I'm loving it)
Girl, I swear to God
They'll pay for ass like yours if it wasn't there, yeah, yeah
(and I'm rubbing it, I'm rubbing it)

[Pre Hook: Sebastian Mikael]
You wanna know if we can make this confidential
Between me and you
(we already did it)
Between me and you
(we already did it)
Remember when I said
I'm tryna find something to get into
I was talkin' 'bout you
(we already did it)
I was talking about you, you, you, you, you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
This ain’t real baby
What they talking bout
Ain’t no rapper that’s alive call Folarin out
Now can you deal with it?
I’ll probably win you out
Cause I never tell a woman
Where my body call
Lemme tell 'bout last night
I don't remember much of last night
How I can say it keeping it polite
Ummmm, you left once, but she came twice
So get it right

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sebastian Mikael]
I swear to God
And I promise I won't tell nobody
Your privacy is safe with me
(and I'm loving it, I'm loving it)
Girl I swear to God
I wanna get plenty time to touch you
(and I'm rubbing it, I'm rubbing it)

[Pre Hook][Intro]
Sevon Miles, baby
I'm feelin' real sexy
Shoutouts to the big niggas out there, mane
Check this out

[Verse 1]
Went from chill avenue to bein' on cloud 9
Got to lookin' at a masterpiece that was outta time
Lemme rephrase, timeless classic
I guess she's cute when she get a lil' savvy
Baby girl thick, can't nobody handle it
Like I can and I could never quit
And what's my favorite dish?
It's shawty right there, lil' miss thick

[Chorus]
I can tell you how I feel about you nite and day
You was on my mind
Fightin' feelings inside
I can tell you how I feel about you nite and day
If you knew what I feel about you
Then you would feel the same way too

[Verse 2]
Emotions kicked rocks when I became addicted
Too much force on the hammer, it's the nail, I missed it
She feels disliked from the others around
Try my best to be there when life gets her down
She was on my mind, in my imagination
It's her lips that I really wanna start tastin'
In reality, it's back to the basics
Takin' things slow like Neo in The Matrix

[Pre-Chorus]
You can think about me anytime
Any day, any night
Any day, any night
I can't stop (thinkin' about you)
It's no good (livin' without you)
I just can't stop (thinkin' about you)
Girl, please tell me ("I been thinkin' about you")

[Chorus]
