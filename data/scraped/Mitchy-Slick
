[Verse 1: Menace]
Fresh out the Pyrex pot, red Chucks on
Red beam on the Glock, so you better get your duck on
Blood in, Blood out, that's how I get my thug on
No smile on my face, that's how I get my mug on
Keep that 40 cal on my waist, I get my slug on
Eastside is the gang, that's how I get my Blood on
Blood know what it is when I got my red cap on
Not from the Nolia but everybody get they clap on
Sippin', sittin' sat, red Kool-Aid pack
The big homie Dub just came home, 'bout to get it crackin'
Yeah, don't mix gang-bangin' with this rap shit
My niggas bananas, red bandanas when they clap shit
Red rags around they face in traffic
Lookin' like George Bush never found Bin Laden
Rick James used to let me drive his lowrider
Bloods in Miami and I ain't talkin' bout Flo Rida

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Got my nigga Streets in here with me
Bloods down south, guns in your mouth
Eat these fuckin' bullets, and shit them bitches out
I'm talkin' Blood nigga shit, Menace what it do?
I keep a red bitch, I call her Damu
I'm sayin' "soowoo" to the hive
You know what I'm bangin' bout
Pistol in my sock, if I run I'll blow a ankle out
I body these beats, body bag in the booth
Red flag around the rear view mirror in the coupe
Oops, I meant the boupe
I'm smokin' on the sloop
And they know my group, more bloods than the loop
Blood I'm too high, I'mma have to stoop
And if you think you fly, I'mma shoot your parachute
Hat to the right, flag to the same side
Weezy F Baby and the F is for flames, five
No homo, big B's nigga
Blood game homie, bleed nigga

[Verse 3: Mitchy Slick]
That's why we decked in all green because we LPBs
Down here in Salty D where Damus roam free
The capital for soo-woopin's the planet of southeast
And this ain't no offshoot city we been in since the 70's
And since I've been around ain't shit about protected communities
I wanted to be down the homies sent me on shootin' sprees
Now where I'm from if you ain't did that you ain't no Blood
Just like if you ain't washed no niggas you ain't no judge
He say "soowoo" in his raps that don't mean shit
You didn't do nothin' when your homie got lit up by them Crips
And the main thing that show that y'all ain't no Blood
Is when you come to San Diego y'all don't hit me up
This is not rap shit, Mitchy's really been active
Blood niggas from bross bountry make sure they get at him
Legendary in the cherry spur with Spalding guts
Yeah, I still got on Dickies, I won't change
Now I'm just a ballin' BloodIf I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 1: D-Lo]

Girl, all you got is pussy to give a nigga?
Dumb bitch, you ain't seeing the bigger picture
Haha!I'm on my big dog shit and if you ain't about no money you can't be my bitch
See, you got action, that satisfaction, my pimping is strong, bitch
But if I gotta hurt you, you gonna be on your own, bitch
I'm 'bout 50 toes down, bro, that's 5 hoes
And when I shoot I don't miss, I think I'm Dale Rose
I'm David Roughy, these bitches, they shoot without me
I fucked her without a penny, boy, that ain't like me
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
No regy, boy, I smoked the dopest reefer
Look, my weed loud, like Samuel L Jackson
I can multiply and divide these bitches like fractions
I'm a rude boy, I'm a cold nigga
I'm the reason these bitches call you they old nigga

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]

She hit the Mandolin, Venetian, and Caesar's in one night
Retired at the crack of dawn till the gates racked her with no god
Never listened to her momma, never listened in school
So if you bet on her listening to ism, you a fool
The pea hunter I call her, all of Vegas know about her
She got hella victims in her bag, got pictures of them with powder
Residue on their nose while they're snoozing in their Polos
He ain't never had real snow so he fucked her to the sun rose
New to the desert, so we never knew vet hoes this cold
To keep frying toes to your asshole but won't give you no blow
Go out like the whole cake, fuck first, I can't screw it
You can tell every bitch at the service, your name's ruined
If I'd have known the business, now you fucked off
Two notes away from paying your rova truck off, now she done truck off
She could've kept that pussy, I'mma fuck who earn this, why I'm always swerving
This the new end journey

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 3: Compton Menace]

She know I get it, I'm pitching about that trap
Niggas, they know it's Menace, I keep that bitch on my lap
Suckers, they love to hate but they never 'bout that paper
Niggas ain't really balling, they ain't playing with the Lakers
Trucking with real lovers, breaking it out with C-Lo
Fucking with bad bitches but keeping it on the d-lo
Step out, niggas love to run they mouth
Niggas come from the bottom cause I lead it from the south
I'm smoking on that shit, pimping on that bitch
Hopping off that lag and jumping in something sick
Sipping on that shit, I'm thinking with my mind on my dick
Baby, I'm a baller, not a trick'
She know that I'm rollin'
She see me, she want it
When I pull up, she on it
She know I'm running that corn

Tell me this

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina[Hook]
I know crack, I know rap
Load a track, load the mack, flip the Lac, flip the Jag
I know, I know, I know a hustler's motive
So I make shit for em to slump while he's rollin
I know, I know

These niggas wanna beef in the west (be the best)
It's obvious I peep it in their swagger, talk, and their dress
I know Quinn, I know Mess, I know Juice they SS
Northern Killafornia hustler's they can tell why I'm stressed
Thousands of records sold out the trunk, they tilts the SS
The squaly with fake breasts, Denali wit paint wet wit
Sound scans that shoulda easily got us deals
But these square labels don't know how the streets feel
Cuttin them eyes on it through my relevence
Then use it for niggas that bang or be out sellin fits
Hear my shit and I got the buckets with them chickens in it
Check any whoopin on the yard and I bet you Slick is in it

[Hook]

I know Kurupt I know Kokane I know 40 Gloccs pain
I was with Big Country BK until the federals came
Hip hops now pop I guess the gangstas done changed
It's cool for every nigga except for a west one to bang
Low lows in the video but can't hit the switch
Nigga can't believe he's singin & makin mills of his shit
But it's cool I guess everybody fam gotta eat
But while you're shoppin your demo nigga I'll be squooshin this D
Slept on any nigga in a Bentley GT
Pull a C-Bo sell a mill without the TV
So fuck what they say, I ain't tryin to hear it
They took out Ts and khaki suits and just changed the lyrics

[Hook]

Gang brand baby of the west coast
Lace the game by Sir Jinx and Crazy Toones yea they made me the lefts most
Go promotin places only the crips go
Do shows with C-B-O and G-Malone
I know Snoop, I know Bad, smoked a blunt once with Daz
40 Water my mentor even chopped it up with Chaz
Miko and Lil Cyco yea they fuckin with Slick
Dego the Sacremento 6 1 9 1 6
Big Wine, Young Hooty yea they climbin with me
Tryin to help these Bs free from this conspiracy
But fuck it, I think I'll stay in SD
But don't come here lookin for none nigga cuz the city's all me

[Hook][Verse 1]
In the nighttime, I don't write rhymes I killa
Niggas rapping thinking that shit is cool, but the fact is I do this for reala
Don't be caught at the bus stop with no weapons
Stuck if you gotta hit the fence real quick then fucked if a nigga bust in your section
I'm from the west coast where you never know when's your death day
Blood niggas, and Crip niggas, and eses with the [wet thangs?]
Little niggas thirteen years old taking knives to triple OGs and shit
Everybody said "Fuck everybody" so now everybody put to sleepin' shit
Take another mission, I will get offended if you do not make a trip with me
I could be alone by myself [where you do it for my health?], but I still represent for the [beak?]
All stay lit for the brainsick
Oh yeah we got Crip niggas too
Oh yeah we got eses too
Oh yeah we got [pyros?] too
Mexican Disciples and the Latin Kings, oh yeah we got Vice Lords too
Indians and the motorcycle gangs, oh yeah we got bikers too
Motherfuckas that'll get ready up to mack, and then hunt ya
Niggas who ain't ever playing, but how can you play when all they ever say is:
"Nigga you a monster"

[Hook]
Everybody said
"Fuck everybody"
So now everybody put to sleepin' shit

From under the bed
Teeth up in your back

Everybody said
"Fuck everybody"
So now everybody put to sleepin' shit

Behind you in the dark
Reaper to the max

Everybody said
"Fuck everybody"
So now everybody put to sleepin' shit

From under the bed
Teeth up in your back

Everybody said
"Fuck everybody"
So now everybody put to sleepin' shit

[Verse 2]

(If flesh is best when bloody)
Make a mess, and yes it's funny
You are death the rest are running
Your a monster

([Fuck, we ain't feeling tasty?])
It's reloading and relocating
Stay strap down with some shit that'll cave your face in
They try to knock me down, but I won't fall
Catch your ass in traffic, and I bet your jaw get blowed off
They say you blessed, and you're here for a reason
I say "yup, yeah I know that's to leave theses niggas bleedin'"
Ain't no passes, just hundred round drums and caskets
[And amigos tattoos?] get burnt to ashes
Block monster
[Baby hey whores and macks?], [and the baby cater thing with the Mickey Mouse trap?]
Yeah I'm that double cinnamon rolls for you don't-knows
Ain't no tapping out, this the life I chose
That's why I'm [every head busta favorite rap nigga?]
Better ask the streets if I'm a motherfucking rap nigga
And I put the wrap on the chicken, put some wings on that bitch
[Have my niggas that'll stay trill?]

[Verse 3]
([trill up they label me the accurate?])
Cuz where I be at [logging?] avenue [it's crawling with goons?] with [pap-bats?]
It's scary walking to school where there's dudes with blue flags
Come through and clack-clack at any nigga standing around when the shit [breaks?]
[Soft he's dead ghost like the walking dead cuz of the homeboys I'm here walking with?]
[But to get infected they will write you lead?]
[It's in your head with the can sted?]
[So inevitably I'm an LPV?]
[It's your destiny where you from around my street?]
Get brainwashed by your double OGs by the time you turn twelve you a B-L-double O-D
Rob Zombie like shit, Stephen King'll [write this trip?]
[How I live, shave a niggas wig with the forty-six I was suppose to kick it back for my nigga kill out with his bitch?]
[Round here niggas can't flip?] that's a urban survival tip
Labeled a terrorist [since the gang put me on that list?]
Can't get a job, can't leave the town, so a nigga's bound to [risk?]
Psychologically made me an animal, I even shoot at a bitch
So to keep from being locked up, I lay low like the lochness
Cuz it's hard being around niggas that act like [mar guai when they wet. trip?][Intro: Crazy Toones Talking]
Okey, Okey, that's what I'm sayin'
There's no compromisin' with bitch-Ass-Niggas
Aiy, aiy baby that's ain't your nigga, he's a bitch
Yeah, I like to hit the shit, in you or that nigga
Aww, that nigga see me piss in his panties

[Verse 1: Mitchy Slick]
Nigga I can't believe you, but now hustlin'
And comin' roam with the dough and handin' it over to this butt
My pig, you picked him, cause he got Rims and TV's "what"
But he's a bitch, when the nigga seize me, he'll speak peace
Couldn't be a gangster into the streets beside peice
And there go, you can thought outta the P.I.M.P "you don't know"
Sounds like a sucker or a buster that tell me
He gotta do somethin', he needs an Identity
To get bitches he needs a Gimmick, so he'll do what he got to
Seen America pimp a few times now he is out poppin' his collar
These freak barricaded ass-niggas make wanna holla
Now all the fly world grew up on the out skirts
Saw the heats, saw they born known him since the birth
Great, but she ain't never knew me
Could have her to them niggas but she scare of the OG's.....

Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]
Now girl you miss him out, cause every bitch you get
What I said, got fake bitches and D.N.G on our blocks
And you must be square as fuck
Not be able to tell that your spouse is a mouse
Never did nothin' to know once when you always hang out "buster"
Never walks to bum and what a shame now "mark"
On the out Skirts with his clique, he got a couple of rounds
With some real niggas, then he'll be knock the fuck out
Girl what's gonna happen, when you bumpin' to a gangster
From the dipped in wants to break you
All cause he knows you niggas are homo
Got pretty twin glass never shot them before
Keep focus, you for shees, and be turn off ease
And you think, you need to stay away from niggas like me
Girl you hustle and then reverse
I can show you how to maximize your network...

[Verse 3: Crazy Toones]
You was a player shit, what nigga, you was a bitch "faggot"
How you from there go and not a blood or a crib (*Gun Cocked*) "aww shit"
And I better not hear no funny shit
When I hit you up about, knockin' you for a honey dip
Unless you want the flesh on your chest
Clacked into a mess for less
Then run into your mouth like a bitch when you see me in the S
Matter fact nigga get your.. come on nigga.. give me that
You might get trick, little mamma with the blacks and tacks
But we know it if your ass get jacked, you're a rat
Only act bunny when he's got this nigga behind him
But wait till them wrong kind nigga find him
Creep behind him and leave him for the squash till I wind hin
My crimes is all gang affiliated
At night we on TV I know you really hate it
And when you bitch see me now she is really faded..

Okey, Okey (*Echoes*)We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
... we just boogy, advance
The rubber band stack thick in my pants
Real gangsters make plots and plans and touch dirt
Only prayin for the day when they can wash they hands
Real gangsters leave nothin to chance at first glance
If it ain't a sho' thing then you bet' not swing
Real gangsters keep that Cutlass clean, keep the monsters mean
And when you dump it drop it right at the scene
Real gangsters got a gangsta lean
You might not talk red, black, or blue but everybody talk green
Glance to my left look over my right shoulder
Livin life in my rearview, FUCK stayin sober
Forget back I sit back and wait for the click-clack
Real gangsters want real spit so I spit that
Real gangsters don't even say it
They just hit the trunk cock it and spray it
Light up your Christmas! Yeah!

[Hook]
We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
... and don't slip up
It's way too late when the bodybags zip up
Real gangsters pray for they soul when they get up
You live by the gun but you'll die by that hit up
Watch that rig up, find yo'self in a box
In a spot where the cops can't dig up
Real gangsters ain't just thugs in bandanas
Slugs and big cannons, drugs and big hammers
Real gangsters open up ya minds and expand 'em
Why was 2Pac really spittin at the cameras?
Cause real gangsters get no peace, they want us six feet deep
Or locked down in the belly of the beast
Real gangsters make bread, rise like yeast
Won't hesitate to put hot chrome to ya teeth
So fuck beef! Real gangsters load heat
When ya see 'em in the street better call the police, c'mon

[Hook]
We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...

[Verse 3: Tone]
... syndrome is a fear
That inner-city residents have of they own peers
People in they own community
Usin a case where two blacks got smoked by one in '93
And ain't now nigga be the murder case
Usin and servin survival shit as a defense plea
In Cali big knot (knot)
The judicial system out here'll have you level fo' 'til you rot
It's because of the system we violence stricken
Forced to frequent the zone when the reefer's driftin
And it's hella drift cause in Southeast Danglewood
Damn near, 30 years of Bloodin and Crippin
And we inflicted with a disease mo' trip than an H-I-V
Can't nuthin protect you from a hundred, drummer 2-2-3's
You can call the police
Wear a V-E-S-T but forget about safety

[Hook]
We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Sitting, fighting this pressure in the state of exhaust
How many times I talked to God, speaking on those that I lost
A couple brother, couple sisters then a bunch of my homies
That's why I move up out my lonely, hoping God'll come show me
A new direction cause I feel like I'm losing faith by the minute
Tryna hide away from reality in something that's tinted
I conversate most of the time across the mind of a seal
Same niggas that showed me love, you might just find em in hell
I hate to see us, or to blame em on everything they been through
In a different circumstance a better life, they might just been you
Tryna provide, missing homicide by minutes
Or they tryna get stripes from a basic Sargent to lieutenant
I do this here for my nigga Dawg, my nigga Clip
Ain't too many others that are sold, that's why I trip
I trip out, but try to keep my cool knowing pain is here
Wanted the sun, but since I missed this shit the rain is here

[Hook: Mitchy Slick]
Abnormal heart, diagnosed at birth
All my niggas got em whole family cursed
T-shirt with their nan just ain't the same
Shoulda have em attack out all the stress and strain
Fuck this fame and this change
Fuck this chain and this Range
With all my real ones gone I can't sleep the same
I wish this fuckin rain' would go away

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Lost is what I feel, looking at where I'm headed
Talked to God begging for help so much I feel like I'm out of credit
He don't know me and I understand, I just need a helping hand
Talked to my grandfather day later, now we on the sand
The homie calls mama's stress
And even though he gone, he still around so yeah we blessed
It's a cold world
They say it get better but I just save the drama tired
From all the pain the I acquired, left the Devil fired
I swear it's life to end the days
Of tryna make it out but I can't get up out this maze
It's me against the world and I can't get up out this phaze
Niggas jumping fly like they can't get up out them J's
I'm on my defence
May my sons forgive me, I don't wanna be no failure
But being real throughout the pain, it hurt like hell I tell ya
It's hard to see when you're surrounded by the dark
It's that type of shit that take ya air support
For real mayne

[Hook][Verse 1: Menace]
Fresh out the Pyrex pot, red Chucks on

I could be alone by myself [where you do it for my health?], but I still represent for the [beak?]
All stay lit for the brainsick
Oh yeah we got Crip niggas too
Oh yeah we got eses too
Oh yeah we got [pyros?] too
Mexican Disciples and the Latin Kings, oh yeah we got Vice Lords too
Indians and the motorcycle gangs, oh yeah we got bikers too
Motherfuckas that'll get ready up to mack, and then hunt ya
Niggas who ain't ever playing, but how can you play when all they ever say is:
"Nigga you a monster"

[Hook]
Everybody said
"Fuck everybody"
So now everybody put to sleepin' shit

From under the bed
Teeth up in your back

Everybody said
"Fuck everybody"
So now everybody put to sleepin' shit

Behind you in the dark
Reaper to the max

Everybody said
"Fuck everybody"
So now everybody put to sleepin' shit

From under the bed
Teeth up in your back

Everybody said
"Fuck everybody"
So now everybody put to sleepin' shit

[Verse 2]

(If flesh is best when bloody)
Make a mess, and yes it's funny
You are death the rest are running
Your a monster

([Fuck, we ain't feeling tasty?])
It's reloading and relocating
Stay strap down with some shit that'll cave your face in
They try to knock me down, but I won't fall
Catch your ass in traffic, and I bet your jaw get blowed off
They say you blessed, and you're here for a reason
I say "yup, yeah I know that's to leave theses niggas bleedin'"
Ain't no passes, just hundred round drums and caskets
[And amigos tattoos?] get burnt to ashes
Block monster
[Baby hey whores and macks?], [and the baby cater thing with the Mickey Mouse trap?]
Yeah I'm that double cinnamon rolls for you don't-knows
Ain't no tapping out, this the life I chose
That's why I'm [every head busta favorite rap nigga?]
Better ask the streets if I'm a motherfucking rap nigga
And I put the wrap on the chicken, put some wings on that bitch
[Have my niggas that'll stay trill?]

[Verse 3]
([trill up they label me the accurate?])
Cuz where I be at [logging?] avenue [it's crawling with goons?] with [pap-bats?]
It's scary walking to school where there's dudes with blue flags
Come through and clack-clack at any nigga standing around when the shit [breaks?]
[Soft he's dead ghost like the walking dead cuz of the homeboys I'm here walking with?]
[But to get infected they will write you lead?]
[It's in your head with the can sted?]
[So inevitably I'm an LPV?]
[It's your destiny where you from around my street?]
Get brainwashed by your double OGs by the time you turn twelve you a B-L-double O-D
Rob Zombie like shit, Stephen King'll [write this trip?]
[How I live, shave a niggas wig with the forty-six I was suppose to kick it back for my nigga kill out with his bitch?]
[Round here niggas can't flip?] that's a urban survival tip
Labeled a terrorist [since the gang put me on that list?]
Can't get a job, can't leave the town, so a nigga's bound to [risk?]
Psychologically made me an animal, I even shoot at a bitch
So to keep from being locked up, I lay low like the lochness
Cuz it's hard being around niggas that act like [mar guai when they wet. trip?]We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
... we just boogy, advance
The rubber band stack thick in my pants
Real gangsters make plots and plans and touch dirt
Only prayin for the day when they can wash they hands
Real gangsters leave nothin to chance at first glance
If it ain't a sho' thing then you bet' not swing
Real gangsters keep that Cutlass clean, keep the monsters mean
And when you dump it drop it right at the scene
Real gangsters got a gangsta lean
You might not talk red, black, or blue but everybody talk green
Glance to my left look over my right shoulder
Livin life in my rearview, FUCK stayin sober
Forget back I sit back and wait for the click-clack
Real gangsters want real spit so I spit that
Real gangsters don't even say it
They just hit the trunk cock it and spray it
Light up your Christmas! Yeah!

[Hook]
We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
... and don't slip up
It's way too late when the bodybags zip up
Real gangsters pray for they soul when they get up
You live by the gun but you'll die by that hit up
Watch that rig up, find yo'self in a box
In a spot where the cops can't dig up
Real gangsters ain't just thugs in bandanas
Slugs and big cannons, drugs and big hammers
Real gangsters open up ya minds and expand 'em
Why was 2Pac really spittin at the cameras?
Cause real gangsters get no peace, they want us six feet deep
Or locked down in the belly of the beast
Real gangsters make bread, rise like yeast
Won't hesitate to put hot chrome to ya teeth
So fuck beef! Real gangsters load heat
When ya see 'em in the street better call the police, c'mon

[Hook]
We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...

[Verse 3: Tone]
... syndrome is a fear
That inner-city residents have of they own peers
People in they own community
Usin a case where two blacks got smoked by one in '93
And ain't now nigga be the murder case
Usin and servin survival shit as a defense plea
In Cali big knot (knot)
The judicial system out here'll have you level fo' 'til you rot
It's because of the system we violence stricken
Forced to frequent the zone when the reefer's driftin
And it's hella drift cause in Southeast Danglewood
Damn near, 30 years of Bloodin and Crippin
And we inflicted with a disease mo' trip than an H-I-V
Can't nuthin protect you from a hundred, drummer 2-2-3's
You can call the police
Wear a V-E-S-T but forget about safety

[Hook]
We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...[Intro: Crazy Toones Talking]
Okey, Okey, that's what I'm sayin'
There's no compromisin' with bitch-Ass-Niggas
Aiy, aiy baby that's ain't your nigga, he's a bitch
Yeah, I like to hit the shit, in you or that nigga
Aww, that nigga see me piss in his panties

[Verse 1: Mitchy Slick]
Nigga I can't believe you, but now hustlin'
And comin' roam with the dough and handin' it over to this butt
My pig, you picked him, cause he got Rims and TV's "what"
But he's a bitch, when the nigga seize me, he'll speak peace
Couldn't be a gangster into the streets beside peice
And there go, you can thought outta the P.I.M.P "you don't know"
Sounds like a sucker or a buster that tell me
He gotta do somethin', he needs an Identity
To get bitches he needs a Gimmick, so he'll do what he got to
Seen America pimp a few times now he is out poppin' his collar
These freak barricaded ass-niggas make wanna holla
Now all the fly world grew up on the out skirts
Saw the heats, saw they born known him since the birth
Great, but she ain't never knew me
Could have her to them niggas but she scare of the OG's.....

[Hook: MC-Ren]
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..

You can't be fly with a guy like that, ugh

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]
Now girl you miss him out, cause every bitch you get
What I said, got fake bitches and D.N.G on our blocks
And you must be square as fuck
Not be able to tell that your spouse is a mouse
Never did nothin' to know once when you always hang out "buster"
Never walks to bum and what a shame now "mark"
On the out Skirts with his clique, he got a couple of rounds
With some real niggas, then he'll be knock the fuck out
Girl what's gonna happen, when you bumpin' to a gangster
From the dipped in wants to break you
All cause he knows you niggas are homo
Got pretty twin glass never shot them before
Keep focus, you for shees, and be turn off ease
And you think, you need to stay away from niggas like me
Girl you hustle and then reverse
I can show you how to maximize your network...

[Hook: MC-Ren]

[Verse 3: Crazy Toones]
You was a player shit, what nigga, you was a bitch "faggot"
How you from there go and not a blood or a crib (*Gun Cocked*) "aww shit"
And I better not hear no funny shit
When I hit you up about, knockin' you for a honey dip
Unless you want the flesh on your chest
Clacked into a mess for less
Then run into your mouth like a bitch when you see me in the S
Matter fact nigga get your.. come on nigga.. give me that
You might get trick, little mamma with the blacks and tacks
But we know it if your ass get jacked, you're a rat
Only act bunny when he's got this nigga behind him
But wait till them wrong kind nigga find him
Creep behind him and leave him for the squash till I wind hin
My crimes is all gang affiliated
At night we on TV I know you really hate it
And when you bitch see me now she is really faded..

[Hook: MC-Ren]

Okey, Okey (*Echoes*)[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Sitting, fighting this pressure in the state of exhaust
How many times I talked to God, speaking on those that I lost
A couple brother, couple sisters then a bunch of my homies
That's why I move up out my lonely, hoping God'll come show me
A new direction cause I feel like I'm losing faith by the minute
Tryna hide away from reality in something that's tinted
I conversate most of the time across the mind of a seal
Same niggas that showed me love, you might just find em in hell
I hate to see us, or to blame em on everything they been through
In a different circumstance a better life, they might just been you
Tryna provide, missing homicide by minutes
Or they tryna get stripes from a basic Sargent to lieutenant
I do this here for my nigga Dawg, my nigga Clip
Ain't too many others that are sold, that's why I trip
I trip out, but try to keep my cool knowing pain is here
Wanted the sun, but since I missed this shit the rain is here

[Hook: Mitchy Slick]
Abnormal heart, diagnosed at birth
All my niggas got em whole family cursed
T-shirt with their nan just ain't the same
Shoulda have em attack out all the stress and strain
Fuck this fame and this change
Fuck this chain and this Range
With all my real ones gone I can't sleep the same
I wish this fuckin rain' would go away

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Lost is what I feel, looking at where I'm headed
Talked to God begging for help so much I feel like I'm out of credit
He don't know me and I understand, I just need a helping hand
Talked to my grandfather day later, now we on the sand
The homie calls mama's stress
And even though he gone, he still around so yeah we blessed
It's a cold world
They say it get better but I just save the drama tired
From all the pain the I acquired, left the Devil fired
I swear it's life to end the days
Of tryna make it out but I can't get up out this maze
It's me against the world and I can't get up out this phaze
Niggas jumping fly like they can't get up out them J's
I'm on my defence
May my sons forgive me, I don't wanna be no failure
But being real throughout the pain, it hurt like hell I tell ya
It's hard to see when you're surrounded by the dark
It's that type of shit that take ya air support
For real mayne

[Hook]If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 1: D-Lo]

Girl, all you got is pussy to give a nigga?
Dumb bitch, you ain't seeing the bigger picture
Haha!I'm on my big dog shit and if you ain't about no money you can't be my bitch
See, you got action, that satisfaction, my pimping is strong, bitch
But if I gotta hurt you, you gonna be on your own, bitch
I'm 'bout 50 toes down, bro, that's 5 hoes
And when I shoot I don't miss, I think I'm Dale Rose
I'm David Roughy, these bitches, they shoot without me
I fucked her without a penny, boy, that ain't like me
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
No regy, boy, I smoked the dopest reefer
Look, my weed loud, like Samuel L Jackson
I can multiply and divide these bitches like fractions
I'm a rude boy, I'm a cold nigga
I'm the reason these bitches call you they old nigga

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]

She hit the Mandolin, Venetian, and Caesar's in one night
Retired at the crack of dawn till the gates racked her with no god
Never listened to her momma, never listened in school
So if you bet on her listening to ism, you a fool
The pea hunter I call her, all of Vegas know about her
She got hella victims in her bag, got pictures of them with powder
Residue on their nose while they're snoozing in their Polos
He ain't never had real snow so he fucked her to the sun rose
New to the desert, so we never knew vet hoes this cold
To keep frying toes to your asshole but won't give you no blow
Go out like the whole cake, fuck first, I can't screw it
You can tell every bitch at the service, your name's ruined
If I'd have known the business, now you fucked off
Two notes away from paying your rova truck off, now she done truck off
She could've kept that pussy, I'mma fuck who earn this, why I'm always swerving
This the new end journey

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 3: Compton Menace]

She know I get it, I'm pitching about that trap
Niggas, they know it's Menace, I keep that bitch on my lap
Suckers, they love to hate but they never 'bout that paper
Niggas ain't really balling, they ain't playing with the Lakers
Trucking with real lovers, breaking it out with C-Lo
Fucking with bad bitches but keeping it on the d-lo
Step out, niggas love to run they mouth
Niggas come from the bottom cause I lead it from the south
I'm smoking on that shit, pimping on that bitch
Hopping off that lag and jumping in something sick
Sipping on that shit, I'm thinking with my mind on my dick
Baby, I'm a baller, not a trick'
She know that I'm rollin'
She see me, she want it
When I pull up, she on it
She know I'm running that corn

Tell me this

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
