Trynna' stack my money high, taller than a grown up
Ladies wanna' have my babies, they gon' go low like limbo
Like for real, what's the deal, whipping out my demo

Looked up in the mirror, that's that shit that made me

Thou shall fear no evil, and never trust nobody

Watch out for them niggas who keep a close eye on them bitches

10 milli yo, sponsored by CMG
Mac a write a book about who owe me
Pussy ass niggas gone D.I.E., on sight, A.S.A.P
Nigga say he gonna snatch my chain
Nigga better know my name
Suicide man the boy insane
He lost his mind that nigga lost his point
If I'm beefing with a nigga I'll fuck his baby momma
Get all in her head and tell that bitch that I love her
Send a pack to my partner
Send a demo to a cousin
Ooh I got his ass in the oven
I just seen this money turn a pretty bitch ugly
Time made a nigga turn state on his cousin
Bitch broke up the whole squad for the pussy
Never be us, swear to god, or we pussy
I fuck with Snootie Wild the strong way
All I know is yayo like the song say
Money dont fold, its the long way
Slow grand, took the long way
My niggas my niggas forever
Enemies, enemies forever
Bitch you whatever
Like Meek said there's levels
And choppers are devils
Got extended on .40 Glocks, I love my Beretta
I might just be a gun fanatic cause my ego a devil

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I've been selling crack since I was 12
Still trying to duck 12 (yep)
Old school Chevy for twelves
And two grams short no scales
Nigga that 12
I don't hit the club before 12
I never fuck with no 12
My bitch is on 12
And my status so hot
I ain't trying to fuck nothing else, yup!

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
All a nigga move is bells
And I move them in dark after 12
Four years locked in a cell and they let me out, nigga, 'round 12
GD is what a nigga bank and it's nothing but love screaming 12
Fuck with a mothafucking client
I'll send your whole crew straight to hell
Nigga hit a lick for like 12 blocks
Caught a motherfucker slipping by the mailbox
My young nigga got hit with like six shots
That's why a nigga walk around here shellshocked
I don't hit the club 'til 12
12 o'clock on my rollie
Nigga might work for the 12
Motherfucker don't know me
Partner called me out for a bitch, so a nigga had to bail
Big brother Gotti told me, don't trust shit in this world
12!

[Chorus x2: Yo Gotti][Hook]
Hop up in this Benz, Benz, Benz, hop up in this Benz
Hop up in this Benz ho, you know what I’m in ho
Hop up in this Benz, Benz, Benz, hop up in this Benz
Hop up in this Benz ho, you and your friend ho

[Verse 1]
Hop up in this Benz, once again, I’m at it again
System winging loud, blowing loud, straight off in the wind
Wind, wind, wind, wind, wind, 100 a ten
What I’m doing fast, throwing cash, I’m showing my ass
CMG gone win, white on white, mister yayo Benz
Throwing up the deuces, I don’t know you, I am not your friend
Friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, GD what it is?
Man I need like ten, wrap em up, put em in the Benz
Skkrt, Skkrt, Skkrt, Skkrt, Skkrt, I’m at it again
Party hard like a white boy, it is what it is
Serving white to a white boy while sitting in my Benz
Hit your bitch then I took your bitch, she like that my Benz

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hop up in this Benz ho, we ain’t gone pretend ho
I know you a freaky dyke, you can bring your friend ho
I keep plenty rocks, pour a four, pistol in the car
You know who I are, they know I’m a star ho
[?] Benz, inside choco
Keep a strap in case, like my nigga Rocko
Make your bitch cha-cha, pussy doing the hopscotch
She know what I’m in, hop up in this Benz ho

[Hook][Intro: Starlito]
I gotta keep it
I told you niggas
I told 'em, I told 'em
Unstoppable
This the kinda shit that I'm on
Take all my pain and put that shit in a song
Just bought another [?] to stay strong
I give my niggas hope, I gotta keep goin'

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
Told these niggas ain't no stoppin' me (aye)
Told these niggas ain't no stoppin' me (aye)

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Ain't no stoppin' me, ain't got no breaks
Can't take no breaks
No rearview, no lookin' back
Just learn from when you make mistakes
No patience on this paper chase
I can't wait nor hate
I'm too busy grindin'
Look at what I did, I visualized
And went to get it
Finally business minded
Pretty much indifferent to them criticizin'
Really shinin' for my guys in prison
Plus my niggas dyin' back-to-back-to-back
That's why I smoke like dat
Never really had shit
How the fuck I'm spose to act
Toaster in my lap, I'm ridin'
Never been appalled to that
Smokin' like some dro and get ghost
Like someone wrote my raps
I'm throwed, niggas throwin' shots like
I won't throw 'em back
But ain't no blockin' these
Nor stoppin' these
Snootie talkin' back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
I hate the choices I've made
Feel like I'm trapped in the gate
But that's the price that you pay
For smokin' dank everyday
My body's gettin' in shape
Mind is about to fade
Cause every time I'm awake
I fall in these fucked up days
The devil is in my face
No turnin' the other way
He's callin' my fuckin' name
He's playin' these mental games
Bobbling' up my brain
Drivin' yo boy insane
Cause even when I regain
My heart is still full of pain
Goddammit this shit is strange
Been sellin' in the rain
Tryin' to cool all my rage
And stack up my cheddar, mayne
Gotta try to maintain
Come up wit a better plan
Or end up get wet up dead
Or locked down up in the pen
They let me out at the end
I'm startin' over again
Cuz once you up in the system
Your freedom you never win
Gotta try to reinvent
For me and my children
Cause thuggin' I really love it
That's why I be in the wind (wind)

I ain't never, I ain't never seen life like this before

Who ever ride with the team, they ain't without the beam
Keep the J's 'fore they hit the streets, hundred bands in my jeans
Never talk what I've seen, bitches don’t mean shit to me
These niggas don’t mean shit to me, all this money might get to me

[Verse 1]
I'm knocking these niggas out spots
Number one song, sit in the charts
Still in the slums, stove and a pot
Keep me a Glock with a rich nigga guap
They try, they try, they try, they try but nigga you not
Really you can't, just need to stop
Martin Luther King, buy me a dream
Vision my mountain, straight to the top
Fuck Hollywood, fuck being a star

Tell me the truth, is you snitching or not?
Fuck the world!
Real, you niggas are not

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I used to be broke as fuck
Nigga, not no more!
All I know is go, in the sky I soar like an eagle
Getting my dough, only Lord knows what I've done
Penitentiary chances, kick in the door and I'm blastin'
Never no question I'm asking
Servin' the fuck up with ratchets
Rocks in my sock with a Glock
Beat to the block 'fore the cop
'Bout to get richer, richer or not
I used to be broke as fuck
Nigga, not no more!
All I know is go, in the sky I soar like an eagle

She's a keeper, he don't know what to do (he don't know)
Baby, you too bad and ya got all that ass

Cause she's a keeper - babe, you the trillest for sure
Down to ride when I'm ready to go
And you look good, I thought you should know
You ain't like them other hoes

[Verse 1: Snootie Wild]
Come straight from the ghetto, ass all on the strip pole
Cashed out with a bankroll, now she focused on college
And I know that she polished, daddy used to swang yayo
Now he locked down on death row, independent, she's got it
And I know I'mma get her, and she know that I want her
Five star in my city, need that in my corner
Five packs for the fifty, posted up on the corner
Used to watchin' her daily, walks to school from my corner
Nigga drivin' her crazy, he just spurned on her
Real estate that pussy, let him know I'm the owner
Thoroughbred and I know soul, all about her gold robe
Dude must be loco, that's why I won't let go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
He don't know what to do wit you
If he did, he wouldn't have put you through

Killin' hoes, you a casualty
And you the one, I ain't gotta tell ya that though
Competition high, yeah ya already know
Imma jet to your city just to bring ya to the show
Turn your house into a mall, turn your closet to a store

Hope this shit here neva eva end wit ya
I could be ya man and friend wit ya

[Bridge]

Pussy nigga shouldn’t talk about it, he don’t know it
New bitch like a quarterback, she gone throw it

Niggas got two ears and one mouth for a reason
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
We never trust none of them niggas unless they with us
Fresh off the lot, I pull off in the skkrt
