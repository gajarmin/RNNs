[Intro]
Just let the pigeons loose let the games begin Tone
Must be crazy, ay yo Sin, what's up Capone?
I created this motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Let me start from the beginnin, you ain't reppin the streets
You from the outskirts of Detroit, where the bitches meet
I'm gonna pull your skirt up, expose your true sex
Antagonize your label, till I get my respect
You ran to your manager, asked him how to handle this
Five shades darker motherfucker you'll be Canibus
No one would care about your complicated rhyme style
Another backpack rapper out of style
Don't let me have to backslap your mom's if you smile
I'm serious, if you ain't 'gon respect her why should I?
Chin check it Snoopy put a circle on that eye
My time's never up cause real niggas don't die
I'm not Moby, the little puppet on MTV
I bring glasses to your living room so you could see me
Yeah you sold alot of units, but you can't be me
The state of hip hop, will continue to be fucked up
You playin by a different set of rules you got me fucked up
Respect the hood Marshall, or the hood'll take you out
You the real wanksta, and I don't care who you sign
Disrespect Benzino, that ass is mine
What you know about pumpin, on the block till you freeze
What you know about cuttin up rocks, duckin D's
What you know about facin, a grand jury indictment
As far as I'm concerned you just industry excitement
I hope them D12 niggas ain't who you fight with
Clash with the titan, you bound to start a crisis
Meanwhile back in Boston I'm a legend
My number in the rafters fuck Bird I'm representin

[Hook]
He's alright but he's not real (Real)
We spit tight and we got steel (Steel)
You talk shit and you get killed (Killed)
From the streets to the studio nigga it's all sealed (Sealed)

[Verse 2]
The two thousand three Vanilla Ice how you playin it
If you ask me, you really ain't that nice you overrated
Hang you from your feet part two in theaters now
Drop your ass from the roof you gonna feel it now
You was unsigned hype, before you ever met Dre
I birthed your little career now you owe your life to Ray
The five mic giver, the Marshall maggot ripper
Better never let me see you with some jewels I'm gonna strip ya
Oh, and tell your label heads stop callin my phone (Jimmy)
Leavin messages sayin please leave him alone (Fuck that!!!)
And don't forget, how this shit all occured to me
Your whole camp be surrounded by security
What you want? the black or the chrome?
How can you ever claim a block, when you have no home
I do it for my niggas in the cells and public housin
You takin too much X Em you need counselin
Get anybody on your roster who could fuck with Ray
Obie Trice you a busta I don't think you wanna play
And 50 holla at your boy get that loot and ride
But please don't make the mistake and take this nigga's side
I hate to have to turn this battle to an all in out war
But if we have to, I'm a leave his partners on the floor
I think we both know exactly what we hear for
I want the streets back I'm comin to your door
I earn my stripes I'm a don you a pussy
Zino bombs hit you out the park you still a rookie
Bottom of the ninth, the scores lookin crazy
Niggas on my block will knock Slim Shady

[Hook]
He's alright but he's not real (Real)
We spit tight and we got steel (Steel)
You talk shit and you get killed (Killed)
From the streets to the studio nigga it's all sealed (Sealed)
He's alright but he's not real (Real)
We spit tight and we got steel (Steel)
You talk shit and you get killed (Killed)
From the streets to the studio nigga it's all sealed (Sealed)

[Outro]
And that's how the motherfuckin story go
Crush, kill, destroy, crush, kill, destroy, crush, kill, destroy
Crush, kill, destroy, crush, kill, destroy(hook)
She said she want to get to know me
Even though she smashed the homie

If we did that it be more that you can handle though

Uh, hold it! This beat is the shit

Yeah! Hold this smack while I empty the clip

(hook)
She said she want to get to know me
Even though she smashed the homie
I'm just saying what they told me

At night she creep in my bed and she yawnin
And then she creep out at 6 in the morning
Skurr! She always riding in something that's foreign

Specially when its dark and the candles are lit
No Love and Hip-Hop this is some animal shit

(hook)
She said she want to get to know me

Secretaries get beat in my office
No, it's not enough so I turn down them offers

We tore it down and you said, "Look what them animals did."

(hook)
She said she want to get to know me
Even though she smashed the homie

I just know you don't want a war with me
So don't fuck with me

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo, it's war this night and over run up on ya few
Boss niggas dump bullets and get rid of that crew

Guns on their friends and they feds dunn yeah dunn
Venalate niggas hear `em out
Wear niggas out
Get them before they get you
Open up your eyes, true
Look alive, dunn its not a game

[Hook 2x: Bobby Brown]
Don't start with me
You don't want to see that side of me
I don't really care how hard ya be
I just know you don't want a war with me
So don't fuck with me

[Benzino]
Yo, swing that, mince that, double bogie, hit that
Big gat, tiger money, holdin one, get that
Forty-cal go and get your burns, spit that
Bring beef where your motherfucking cribs at
Shove knives in your chest where your ribs at
Get money with my Hangmen, split that
Come thick when we show those guns
Doing 1-6-0 on the Autobahn
Ride all night drink cris til dawn
Tonight we don't care, right from wrong
Anybody wanna kick the same old song
Bitch-ass niggas won't last too long, motherfucker

[Hook 2x: Bobby Brown]
Don't start with me
You don't want to see that side of me
I don't really care how hard ya be
I just know you don't want a war with me
So don't fuck with me

[Bobby Brown]
Meet you overnight
Rest now thats tomorrow
My projects thorough
Tribes with Made Men, now you know
No matter what happened in the barium rocks
Still remain with my pistol in my palm cocked
God damn, country, all shit is sick
Cause shit ain't but a bag full of fucking tricks
Addition and money in my pocket
So I'm a dip into my bag and grab my motherfucking clip
Then I'm a break out the door cause I'm mad like fuck
And I'm pissed off and like get your ass and stick you up
No hold barred and its time to get paid over
I'm broke, ain't nuttin funny I need money

[Bobby Brown & Benzino] (Bobby Brown)
Fuckers want to try and change the game (I did that)
Try throw dirt on my name (You got that)
Storm them for their fortune and fame (You want that)
Twenty karats on my neck, wrist and brain (I flaunt that)

[Hook 6x: Bobby Brown]
Don't start with me
You don't want to see that side of me
I don't really care how hard ya be
I just know you don't want a war with me
So don't fuck with me[Benzino]
Benzino, unhh!
Throw 'em up
Up here in the 6-1-7
Ray Benzino
Yo, killa tactics

[K.T.]
Yo, why y'all niggas wanna test me, I'm out your division
I got more bars and hooks than Mike Tyson in prison
Listen, you ain't gangsta, killa
Shorty sure only boy you touched befo' is Vicks 44
Hoes should squeeze fern, spread like a sick germ
Have niggas face down on the floor like they doin the kick worm
Think something sweet with me, try me
And watch how fast I rash on niggas like poison ivy
Cats claim they got guns, they scared to dunk
I thump on a nigga back like I kick 'em between the trunk
When Boston's in the house niggas head for the exit
I put the toast in they mouth like it's breakfast

[Prince]
These niggas hatin my guts cuz I'm raking in bucks
Havin straight parties with nothin but bitches with C-cups
Models with manicured hands, livin my feet up
Yo, let's speed up, I leave the week later, traitor
I gotta spray ya axe up crooked, I'm doin you a favor
Look at you ain't a playa so, you'll hate on me later
I decorate ya clothes, puttin holes through ya paper
Reck those, respect the flows and catch kang-goes
Professionals tell me I'm the next to blow
Yeah pop, I already know, I'm just perfectin the flow
I got bitches at my window, I get sex to go
Even though I hate nosy hoes like I'ma go-star

[Smoke]
Niggas ask me, Smoke why ya go so hard?
I'm tryin to get sucked off in the Benz Coup Drop
Tryin to have all my C'z niggas shoot for the stars
My nine stars spread bullets like grey poupon
I'm tryin to ice on my wrist and on my arm
With the high beam shit so frigid it won't visit
Or put that nigga Jake up out of business
You niggas know fast life, niggas blast nines and toss 'em in a bucket full of acid
Now, if I don't leave a nigga and I see you cast up in the pod'
To his motherfucking mouth he ain't gotta have asthma
I hold down blocks like Mutombo, and check with the muzzle
Got niggas yellin "break!" runnin different ways
Like them bitch-niggas was comin out a 'hugem

[Chorus: Benzino]
My Boston niggas wanna ride
Mattapan niggas gonna ride
Roxbury niggas wanna ride
Do you wanna ride?
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
South End niggas gonna ride [Throw 'em up]
Hyde Park niggas wanna ride [Hangmen 3!]
JP niggas gonna ride
Do you wanna ride? [Un-hunh]
Tell me, do you wanna ride? [What!]

[Luv]
The blazin spot is here, take a shot wit me
I prefer the grey guch short a Hennesey
My chicks pull out your door, go and buy the bar
Tellin you don't even ride you got your own car
My fellas, who ain't come through don't sweat us
Some of ya girls is watchin and they probably get jealous
We rock the club all out, rock the bra
Comin through and throwin like Michael's glove
I show ya love, only if ya down to get dirty
My niggas in the back, I don't think y'all heard me
Bring ya ass in the front, get crunk and corrupt
Grind up on a chick that you know you wanna fuck

[Weirdo]
I've been known the toughest nigga, my pockets a size bigga
Inch taller, nigga, don't fuck with a true baller
We so harda, how do you think, we in Impalla?
We spendin on them drinkies, my remiss a bit louder
Strong power, murder dungeons with promptness
Fuckin wit doe and twist ya cock to ya casket
Ya left on the scene, pockets ripped off ya jeans
All crunked up and lunked up, my attitudes mean
Ya know Minks wantin it, Franco Harris runnin it
38 Mag, I thump on faggots comin wit
My hands, they chop grands, pop cannons
Sock drop dudes same spots that they standin

[O.T.]
It's that bastard child, small frame, heavy waist
With that raspy crowd reck shop everyday
Niggas test the blaze, bullets move steady pace
Gettin hot burns, still a few on your waist
I got a fetish for cream mixed with ash and green
Eyes blood shot red when I pop on the scene
I got a few niggas with me and they grills is mean
Drunk pissy in the lobby, niggas shout in the Beam (Hello!)
Timbaland's be fitted, Jeeps that tinted
On some 20's, like whoa, with the gleam all in it
A nigga take it how they want it, son we in it to the finish
Rob Low and 'Zino, niggas ain't fuckin wit it

I'm out here
You know what I'm sayin?
It's crazy wild out here
So I got to roll with mines like that, man
And be prepared for anything that jump off
You know what I'm sayin?
Yo Rhome, man
Tell em what that cop did to that kid

[ Tony Rhome ]
Yeah man, that's real messed up
But I'ma tell ya like this
Check it

[ VERSE 1: Tony Rhome ]
A brother caught a bullet, now he's dead
Chopped by a cop who seen him trouble enough to bleed him from the head
And that's goin out the foul way
Straight up murder, word of mouth is that he done him in the hallway
And like always a lot of controversy
But of course he got away scott-free and yo, it hurts me
And it makes me angry just knowin that a cop can't stop
Reach, pull the trigger, no speech
Laid off for two weeks and then he's back on the streets
No investigation
Just a paid vacation
For the jake who did the bustin
Yo, you can't trust him
Cause back in Boston there was a kid trained by a cop
Days later the same kid found shot
Bleedin to death as he was left up under a car
Hey yo, Boston, I'm gettin strapped, I know who they are
Cause back in the days I went to school with him
And I remember when I was kinda cool with him
But now he got a badge and a tool with him
And he's up to no good in the hood
And he would make your life a livin hell if he could
And I don't see an endin
Unless the corrupt cops on the streets are apprehended
Until then I'ma feel my life is in danger
So Tony Rhome is keepin one in the chamber

	(One in the chamber)  --] Ice Cube

Yo, Legion of Doom, time to suit up

[ VERSE 2: Ray Benzino ]
I wake up every mornin and get geared up
Huh, I grab my Tec just in case I gotta tear up
I reach up under my bed, look in the shoe box
Take my clip, now I'm headed for the block
Yo, every day'll be the same old trip
Young brothers gettin shot up, baseheads gettin pistol-whipped
I gotta get away, cause see, I can't cope
Cause here's where I get dope
So I put up with the nonsense
I'm still servin up fiends while my man's rollin ?????
And don't think you can run up on the one they call Ray
Dog, cause I'm strapped every day
You're always fiendin, lookin greedy, up to no good
Cause RSO is rockin Timberlands and black hoods
Just don't play us like strangers
Huh, Raydog keeps one in the chamber

	(One in the chamber)

[ VERSE 3: E-Devious ]
I knew this kid who was livin kinda foul with no mercy
(No mercy) sort of blood-thirsty
He was out here makin a little change
But this thing about him made him a little strange
He was cool to a certain extent
Then he would disappear, no one knew where he went
He was cuttin brothers' throats
And drapin his crew in black and leather Adidas coats
Servin up fiends like it wasn't no thing
Cause he did it more smoother then when Barry White would sing
People didn't know he had two personalities
Yeah, they let the papes blur out all the realities
But E, naw, I straight used to beef him
Five-o would shake us down, but him they used to keep him
They would talk to him, he said a lot to em
Man, they would roll up and he would just walk to em
I'm lookin at my homies like, yo!
Why's the cop givin the kid dough?
Hmm, somebody yelled out (Yo, he's just bein real friendly)
Aight, then why's the cop lookin at us with a pen, bee?
Y'all can't see, but I ain't nobody's fool
He ain't cool, he's goin out like a pigeon on a stool
Hangin on the block, doin what we do
Kickin willie bobo to the cops
Ace, give me the joint, put one in the chamber
Put one in the chamber, this kid is bringin danger
Now y'all can sit around and wait for the heat to blow
But I'd rather see him layin six feet below
He wanna play mischievious
Let me show him when you're messin with E-Devious
How the game gets played, the game's played with anger
And I'm playing with one in the chamber

	(One in the chamber)[Intro: Benzino] + (Lil' Kim)
Ayo (Benzino where you at?)
It's Yellowman, Benzino wanna rock the party
And we gonna bring this to the after party
Queen Bee wanna rock the party
Uh, uh, oh (Oh my God)

Young Hef wanna rock the party, Petey Pablo
Yellow City, yea

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
It's your girl Queen Bee with the poisoness sting
Chinchilla draggin' with the diamond G-String
Bouncin' on Lorenzos I'm the Bee with the wings
Who the fuck want what? (What?)
Bettin' it all at the crap tables, rip the casino
From Vegas to Reno, me and Benzino
We gonna rock the party and drink Bacardi, all damn night
Awww watch me shake my ass like a fresh bowl of jelly
Quite Bootylicious like Beyonce and Kelly
Love to see guys with tattoos on they belly
Let's get nasty from the car to the telly
Ooh, I got my girls with me, so go get your boys
Come ride with us, we on the tour bus
If you treat us right, and you spendin' the night
Then we gon' freak

[Chorus: Benzino] + (Lil' Kim)
We gon' throw the party, rock the party
Then drink Bakardi, freak somebody
Then leave the party to the after party y'all
Now what ya'll gon' do?
(We gon' take it off, we gon' turn it out
It's hot in here, we gon' burn it out
We gon' throw that thang, we gon' back it up
Now what ya'll gon' do?)

[Verse 2 Benzino]
Benzino rock the city and you know I can't stop
Back at the lounge with a mean Diddy Bop
Shorty lookin' mean and her whole team hot
Yo' what's up? Yo' what's up with ya'll?
She sippin' cranberry with a splash of Belvedere
What? Five carot 'conia ice in my ear
Always drinkin' Coniac with ice when I'm here
... Nice
Feelin' how 'Zino put's his game to the test
36, 24, I think you know the rest
What's your secret ma? How you fit in that dress?
... Oh damn!
Now it's gettin' heated and you know what's on my mind
Me and you, outta hear, I think it's that time
Make you tap out when I creep in from behind
Now that's what's up, now everybody just

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Hey hey hey hey
Me met a bitch of my dreams, corn jack
Come on, liquor inside my head like that
Pants saggin', Carolina hat to the back
I'm in New York City, can you hear me goddamnit
Weavin' through the traffic, shootin' usual daps
Tryna find Benzino, is it him in the back
Bring it back, porn channel X on the back
Be like hey hey hey, how'd she do that?
Pretty headed woman, with her fine self
Bow-legged cutey with her tight legs
Tryna get outta here with her friend in the black dress
Spread her hoochie coochie on my sun beam bread
Now I been sayin' to myself, Petey Petey
Get freaky, damn boy I can't even say it
And I got no need to be scared
Some things ain't supposed to be said

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Benzino] + (Lil' Kim)
Yeah, we gon' rock
Yellow City, we gon' rock
The after party, we gon' rock
(Now what ya'll gon' do?)
We gon' rock, we gon' rock tonight
Cuz a Yellow City party don't stop
Uh, we gonna rock tonight
Now what ya'll gon' do?

Hangmen 3
Runnin off topic

[Hook]
Aiyyo, stop what ya doin and bang ta dis
Put ya glass down and grab a chick
Don't even think you can hang with this
Bitch-ass niggas can't hang with this

Blunts, bitches, clips, guns
Bars, bricks, whips, funds [4x]

[Benzino]
Come to think about it we ain't ordinary men
You think you immortal, my dogs ain't sleepin
Run through ya crib at 6 in the evenin
10 o'clock news, front page section
Count all the votes, Benzino's been elected
Most dangerous, most violent
My killers always move in silence
Put 'dro in a blunt, twist it up
Put fo' in ya gut, twist you up
You ain't heard, not guilty's the verdict
I paint a clear picture, you spit with no vision
I spit viscious, we all in position
Check a nigga history, you better ask around
Rap's greatest mystery
This is for my real dog niggas, incarcerated tears
Niggas all in tears, throw it up

[Hook]
Aiyyo, stop what ya doin and bang ta dis
Put ya glass down and grab a chick
Don't even think you can hang with this
Bitch-ass niggas can't hang with this

Blunts, bitches, clips, guns
Bars, bricks, whips, funds [4x]

[Benzino]
Sky's the limit, long as my heart pump I'll be in it
'Til I overcome, finally win it
Used to hit the street hard
Hustle like time was endin, and I'm not pretendin
I choose my own destiny
And can't nobody get the best of me
And half y'all niggas can't get next to me
Y'all ain't strong enough to question me
Cuz ain't no tellin when it's time to go to war
Specially when niggas don't bang no more
Fake-ass rappers should cut and take ten
You act like you can't get laid in coffin
You act like niggas get play from Boston
Never underestimate it too often
Smoke hash just to ease the pain
And keep stayin focused on gettin payed
Still searchin in my soul for the answers
Askin God why I'm gettin these chances
Home Boston, we harm if we hungry
Fight if we starvin, I'll die for this money

[Hook] 2x
Aiyyo, stop what ya doin and bang ta dis
Put ya glass down and grab a chick
Don't even think you can hang with this
Bitch-ass niggas can't hang with this

Blunts, bitches, clips, guns
Bars, bricks, whips, funds [4x]Check it out, here we go

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I bet cutie wanna freak
Don't matter if she on covers of Maxim or Jet "Beauty of the Week"
Give 'em wet cooties when I speak
I usually flash thousands worth of invisbly set jew-ies on a freak
It's likely I'm a take boo in the cut
Take her back to Spike Lee & have her doin' the butt, and I'm a mention
Just the way you shake it make my little soldier stand at attention
My hands gon' be inchin', cause I'm standin' there flinchin'
Tryin' to hold my hand back from pinchin'
But, ma I can't follow too long
Unless you look like a model who on, and swallow boo bons
I'm the kid in the XL Model Yukon
That get more numbers than a lotto coupon
Yo, F-A-B go scanty
Ma, you know how many I meet with no panties?

Boottee (*5 Times*)
I see boottee, I see boottee

[Verse 2: Benzino]
Benzino, if you can't stand the heat get the fuck out the kitchen
Chauffer driven limousines straight outta prison
In jewelery, man listen
Masterpiece was out to long I never wore presidentials
Still payin' for the shit Jacob lent you (Bootee)
Still waitin' for the check the label sent you (Bootee)
I'm still doin' things you can't imagine (Bootee)
That's there for blastin'
Bangin' on wax that's bootee
Face it Teddy banged tracks
Zino lace it
I like the chicks with the big fat ones
When you back that ass up all you feel is my gun
Hourglass ass you a mo'fucker boo
So please believe it I'm leavin' with you
& if you want 3 I'm freakin' with you
Benzino smashed bootee more than a few
Ha, ha ha

Bootee (*4 Times*)
I see boottee, I see boottee

[Verse 3: G-Dep]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aiyyo 8 classes, champagne glasses
V.I.P. passes lettin in all the asses
Got move fastest, cheek to cheek
Move from freak to freak, speak the greek
Shorty with the sleek physique, lots of stylin
The way you move I can tell you got some talent
Intelligent & she fuckin' with seniors
I need brains & you probably a genius
Bein' the Bad Boy you know I be
It's all ages you ain't gotta show ID
Too young is a man in China
So what if she can buy a gray goose with a loose vagina
Forget Azure's, I'll take her to court
Catch me on the dance floor tailgatin' a broad
I don't care is she ain't a cutie, ask fruity
When I see boottee, I see boottee

Bootee (*4 Times*)

I see boottee, I see boottee

[Outro]
Aiyyo my party people dance to this (boottee, boottee)
Party people dance to this (Feel me, feel me)

Repeat 3.5 Times

Ladies show your thongs drop your pants to this[Intro]
Yeah
You thought it was over?
Nah
You can't get rid of me
I'm your arch nemesis
And I'm not stopping
'Til I've accomplished what I've came here for
Complete elimination

[Verse 1]
It's about to be the death of Slim Shady
A little over 2 years, he still can't face me
That shit you pulled up in the D was a slick move
You should have got Dave, cause now I'm gon' get you
And I ain't even press up on you like I should
Double up on your security
Wish a nigga would tryna run up to the station
And I'll be waiting here with fully automatics macs, running out of patience
Got a fucking nerve taking me to trial
For copyright infringement, you said it was a freestyle
And you lied about your age, you was 21
And never ever make a move with an empty gun
I'll go to war, never folded
Snipe you on the 50-yard line while you talking to Sway
Or while you walking with Dre, it don't matter
Catch you at the show, you ain't built for battle

[Hook 1]
(It was me) that made you stop doing shows in the states
(It was me) that made the call to put Pauly on the tape
(It was me) that made your uncle put the burner to his face
"You can run but you can't hide, I'll find ya"
(It was me) that got your boy Proof served in Miami
(It was me) that struck a nerve when I said Fuck Hailie
(It was me) that ultimately put an end to Slim Shady
"You crossed the wrong motherfucker, now you paranoid"

[Verse 2]
Paul told me on his celly, coward you a lightweight
Steve Stoute can never front cause he the same way
The whole circle's just a bunch of little bitches
Tap dancing niggas, and weight lifting snitches
And I know I didn't hear you say you helped building rap
You're a puppet, sitting like a kid in Jimmy's lap
Makaveli rolling over in his grave
You fucking up his music, the beats don't bang
And where's your girl Kim? I need to get my dick sucked
I heard she like coke, she wanna get her face fucked
But I ain't freaking with no trailer park trash
I'll leave that shit to you Marshall Math, I'll pass
What's the use of having papers, if you hide it?
I can see the Source awards, but missing at the Vibe in?
How can you call yourself the number one rapper
XXL showing love cracker

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
Heard up on the radio, you said you want to squash beef
It's kinda funny, to me this shit was never beef
In Puerto Rico with the burner in hand
Ran up on Green Lantern, he almost shit in his pants, damn
Raise the white flag, I'm charging up the hill
Nail in the coffin, I'm impossible to kill
I'm your worst nightmare, the reaper in the flesh
Its a fight 'til the finish, a battle 'til the death
Dressing like a woman just to sell a few copies
Disrespecting Mike, Em you getting sloppy
Your albums is atrocious, Jimmy's scared in double
Fuck a D12 cause their careers are in trouble
Angie needs to get your nuts up out her mouth
Enuff's a dickrider, I'll air these niggas out
And anybody else who wanna try to hold ya
Cause in all reality, you're the only toy soldier

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
(It was me) that made you stop doing shows in the states
(It was me) that made the call to put Pauly on the tape
(It was me) that made your uncle put the burner to his face
"I'm on the hunt so keep your shit low"
(It was me) that got your boy Proof served in Miami
(It was me) that struck a nerve when I said Fuck Hailie
(It was me) that ultimately put an end to Slim Shady
"But yo, I'm kinda slacking up, I should've killed you from the get-go"

[Benzino talking during Hook 1 & Hook 2]
Cocksucker
It was me, Benzino
You know where I'm at
You are scared to a flea motherfucker
Huh
[?]
Hangmen 3 motherfucker
You know what it is
Huh
Oh believe that shit
But don't think we gonna run into each other
We gon' see[Benzino]
Lord help us, my peoples bein' raped (uh)
Deliver me from evil and I'll seal this devil's fate
Let's take a closer look at what's really happenin'
He wants you to believe that it was all about rappin'
And all I try to do is open up my niggas eyes
It wasn't about me and Em, you gotta realise
It's just a smokescreen, my niggas there's a bigger picture
I want the streets to pay attention cause I'm ridin' with ya
This credibility is what we here for
Then why ain't the hood sellin' units no more (tell me why)
Labels actin' like it's good so they say so
EPMD was always gold with no radio
Now it's time to turn the prophecy, time's up
Marshall Mathers gotta die, rise up
No choice, the only way we gonna turn this shit around
Is put this little bitch in the ground
And these so called kings, steady going at eachother
Do songs with the devil, while they fightin' with their brothers
Sell a house, fuckin' pitiful, we always just some drama
Let 'em slide through then they devide, conquer
And every plantation got a bunch a house niggas
D12, Shady Records just a bunch of house niggas
Obie Trice, is for security in your front lobby
Better call the secret service, if you gonna stop me (blaah)
Paul Rosenberg, you fat fuckin' pig
I'm holding you responsible for what this bitch did (kill ya)
Cause you call me up, try to cop or plead
As far as I'm concerned you both gonna bleed (bitch)
Talkin' bout he wanna fight, please
Let's set that shit up quick so I can drop him to his knees
You let a clown clown you, how insane is that
You let em tongue kiss your wife when you had a gat
How you gonna have a gun with no bullets
Oh don't worry cause when I see you I'm gonna pull it (blaah)
You dyed ya hear blond, I'm a make it red
How you gonna sell records Marshall when you dead
Motherfuck make you pay for that bullshit you talkin'
I'm goin' hard in the streets of New York and
Just ask Chuck how we ran 'em outta Boston
He should have been killed left in the coffin
And you better keep my kids out ya fuckin' mouth
Before I put a Glock in yo' motherfuckin' mouth
Tell Hailie it ain't safe no more (nah)
Daddy better watch yo' back at the candystore
We fucked up, resort to plan B
Fuck around she end up like JonBenét Ramsey (that's right)
Matter of fact you better check the DNA (what)
She probably ain't yours, and where's your wife Kim anyway
She's on her knees somewhere suckin' 50 Cent
I know you wishin' you were there cause you on his dick
You dress in drag, you huggin' up on Elton John
You closet fag, I'm a king you a little punk
You the rap David Duke, the rap Hitler
The culture stealer, niggas ain't with ya
I'm the rap Huey, the rap Malcolm, the rap Martin
Don't worry I'm a finish what we started
And everybody who wanna scream Pac's name
You don't make a difference, you in it for the fame
Cause if Pac was livin', he would shoot this bitch alive
But I'm a do it for him, if the hood must survive
You sleep with five-o, you walk with the feds
Better keep the lights on, when they tuck you into bed
Cause I'm a get yo' silly ass, find out where you lay
When Debbie set you up you gonna die another day[Hook - Troy Bell (Benzino)]
Look into my eyes and you will see (my struggle, my pain)
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me (made me who I am)
There's no other place that I would rather be (Benzino)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me (Troy Bell)
This life chose me (c'mon Troy, let's go)
[Intro - Benzino (Troy Bell)]
Yeah
This one's for the world, my people *my people)
You think you know me *uh uh*, you have no idea who I am
This is my story, it's not about the magazine
About my baggy jeans, my braids, or my jewelry
The Money, Nah
This is why I didn't choose this life (yeah yeah)
This life chose me
[Verse 1 - Benzino]
It wasn't long ago when it all began
Standing in the graveyard while they buried my man
That's when I first understood how this game is played
Either kill a nigga quick, or you might get get played
Scene never was that big, the hood was even smaller
Grew up in the projects, then we moved to four corners
Pops went to prison, I knew about the system
Every sunday morning me and moms paid a visit
He was heavy in the streets, maybe mafia connected
All I'm gonna say he was very well respected
They called me Ray Dog, yeah that's Tito's son
I met a lot of great men for many years to come
I'm getting money on my block all night
Running with a bunch of niggas born to fight
Boston was the first on the east to really bang out
Niggas run these streets while they automatics rang out

[Hook - Troy Bell (Benzino)]
Look into my eyes and you will see
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me
There's no other place that I would rather be (that's right)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me (I didn't choose this man)
(yeah)

[Verse 2 - Benzino]
Now fuckin' with these niggas on the other side of town
The All Mighty forms, we the hardest click around
Jewelry was heavy, niggas rolled thirty thick
Artillery was heavy, jake steady on my dick
And I'm squeezin all types of guns *whatever*
Mom's is cryin but that's the life I loves
And that's the life I love, street life, real thug niggas making rap music
I met Dave at the radio, he cool
Started The Source mag, always had to be in school
One piece of paper, then it grew into a book
But I had my own paper cause my block wasn't looked
I caught a couple of bids, I'm fightin' court cases
It was news at eleven, or in the news papers
Investigation federal, I knew it from the start
Either jealousy, or envy, tore my crew apart

[Hook - Troy Bell (Benzino)]
Look into my eyes and you will see
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me
There's no other place that I would rather be
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
(here we go)

[Verse 3 - Benzino]
If money's is the root of all evil, then burn it
Or get up off your ass, motherfucker, and earn it
I moved to New York, it was time to make it happen
Dave is my dog, and yeah Zno still rapping
I walked through the valley of death with no fear
I'm holdin' Dave down till a niggas outta here
I breathe for my niggas deceased, holdin' in
Exhale all the anger that I'm holding within
Too many people in my life never comming back
Never where you from, it's only where you standin' at
I got a few good niggas, a box of ammunition
That's all I really need for me to carry out a mission
If Eminem wanna squash beef, tell him call me *where you at*
Meet him anywhere, he can bring his whole army
The day will soon come when the world recognize
Zno is the realest since Pac been alive
Motherfucker!
[Hook - Troy Bell, (Benzino)]
Look into my eyes and you will see (yeah, it's about the struggle man)
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me (yeah it's about my people man)
There's no other place that I would rather be (you wanna know me huh)
(don't judge me, there's only one that can judge man, you need to know me man)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
(don't judge me, there's only one that can judge man, you need to know me man)
Look into my eyes and you will see (I didn't choose this life, this life was bestowed upon me)
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me (ha, you can't walk in my shoes yo)
There's no other place that I would rather be (ugh, yeah they're my niggas, and I'm still here man)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me (yeah I'm still here, and I'm going nowhere)

[Outro - Benzino]
Uh huh uh huh, yeah
Yeah Troy
You did it on this one nigga, believe that
Yeah, The Arch Nemesis
In a hood near you
Get it[Intro]
Just let the pigeons loose let the games begin Tone
Must be crazy, ay yo Sin, what's up Capone?
I created this motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Let me start from the beginnin, you ain't reppin the streets
You from the outskirts of Detroit, where the bitches meet
I'm gonna pull your skirt up, expose your true sex
Antagonize your label, till I get my respect
You ran to your manager, asked him how to handle this
Five shades darker motherfucker you'll be Canibus
No one would care about your complicated rhyme style
Another backpack rapper out of style
Don't let me have to backslap your mom's if you smile
I'm serious, if you ain't 'gon respect her why should I?
Chin check it Snoopy put a circle on that eye
My time's never up cause real niggas don't die
I'm not Moby, the little puppet on MTV
I bring glasses to your living room so you could see me
Yeah you sold alot of units, but you can't be me
The state of hip hop, will continue to be fucked up
You playin by a different set of rules you got me fucked up
Respect the hood Marshall, or the hood'll take you out
You the real wanksta, and I don't care who you sign
Disrespect Benzino, that ass is mine
What you know about pumpin, on the block till you freeze
What you know about cuttin up rocks, duckin D's
What you know about facin, a grand jury indictment
As far as I'm concerned you just industry excitement
I hope them D12 niggas ain't who you fight with
Clash with the titan, you bound to start a crisis
Meanwhile back in Boston I'm a legend
My number in the rafters fuck Bird I'm representin

[Hook]
He's alright but he's not real (Real)
We spit tight and we got steel (Steel)
You talk shit and you get killed (Killed)
From the streets to the studio nigga it's all sealed (Sealed)

[Verse 2]
The two thousand three Vanilla Ice how you playin it
If you ask me, you really ain't that nice you overrated
Hang you from your feet part two in theaters now
Drop your ass from the roof you gonna feel it now
You was unsigned hype, before you ever met Dre
I birthed your little career now you owe your life to Ray
The five mic giver, the Marshall maggot ripper
Better never let me see you with some jewels I'm gonna strip ya
Oh, and tell your label heads stop callin my phone (Jimmy)
Leavin messages sayin please leave him alone (Fuck that!!!)
And don't forget, how this shit all occured to me
Your whole camp be surrounded by security
What you want? the black or the chrome?
How can you ever claim a block, when you have no home
I do it for my niggas in the cells and public housin
You takin too much X Em you need counselin
Get anybody on your roster who could fuck with Ray
Obie Trice you a busta I don't think you wanna play
And 50 holla at your boy get that loot and ride
But please don't make the mistake and take this nigga's side
I hate to have to turn this battle to an all in out war
But if we have to, I'm a leave his partners on the floor
I think we both know exactly what we hear for
I want the streets back I'm comin to your door
I earn my stripes I'm a don you a pussy
Zino bombs hit you out the park you still a rookie
Bottom of the ninth, the scores lookin crazy
Niggas on my block will knock Slim Shady

[Hook]
He's alright but he's not real (Real)
We spit tight and we got steel (Steel)
You talk shit and you get killed (Killed)
From the streets to the studio nigga it's all sealed (Sealed)
He's alright but he's not real (Real)
We spit tight and we got steel (Steel)
You talk shit and you get killed (Killed)
From the streets to the studio nigga it's all sealed (Sealed)

[Outro]
And that's how the motherfuckin story go
Crush, kill, destroy, crush, kill, destroy, crush, kill, destroy
Crush, kill, destroy, crush, kill, destroy[Benzino]
Ima smoke until I'm fried
Help me cope with the demons that I can't hide
Intuition is a gift (nigga)
If you think that a nigga did it
Hit em in the chest and keep it movin'
Or go sit your silly ass down
Dont give me no excuses that you turned your little life around (naw)
You were born into violence
You weave pain, ain't nuttin but a g thang
Anyway, you better get him 'fore he get you (get you)
Fuck around, fall asleep then he wet you
Fuck around he call the feds then they get you
And your bitch is gonna flip and forget you
Drop to my knees, Lord I'm reachin out
I'm ordain to the streets (Tell me whats it all about uh)
Kill them niggas with the clout
Eliminate these haters
Ima deal with you later
Man this shit got me fucked up (fucked up)
Right up
I gotta keep token (pass that shit)
Conversatin with the devil
Im on another level
The evil thing that men do
Off with your head if you fuckin with Benzino (fuckin with Benzino)

[Hook]

God I'm droppin to my knees (to my knees)
My Rosaries in my hand
And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord please)
Gotta take the pain away (Gotta take the pain away)
Will I live to see another day (another day)

[Verse 2]
I was, boring in heaven, raised in hell
Fightin demons off my back
Attack and kill
Chill
When murder is an option
Gotta take precaution
I'm already known, the Lord has a plan
But it's so damn hard bein honest man
And I'm stuck in my ways
So Ima blaze for life
Give these streets some praise
I know they raised me right (haha)
Jesus Christ, if my life turns upside-down
I'll sit beside you in your kingdom with your angels round
Hear the sound of your choir
All in my brain
The streets is on fire
They callin my name
Even though they caused me so much pain (so much pain)
They lace a thugged up on so much game (so much game)
The agony in extacy
People mad at me
If Judas' is next to me
End up in tragedy
Fuck it
Im destined to die young
Im losin my religion
Speakin in tounge
Im on a one way trip to death
Inhaling this pain like it's my last breath (so whats next)
Ima kill you 'fore you kill me
Fuckin with Hobby ya dead body
Your bitch gonna feel me

[Hook]

God I'm droppin to my knees (to my knees)
My Rosaries in my hand
And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord please)
Gotta take the pain away
Will I live to see another day (another day)

[Fatal Hussein]
Hussein the don
It's nothin I get there early
Cuz I stay in the mix
Could you imagine all the demons
When you stay in the Bricks
And every night I hear em talkin to me
It's like I hear em when they call me in my sleep
But I ain't tryin ta feel em walkin to me
Six million ways to die
I choose the one, thats easiest to me
So I choose the gun
And if you choose the wrong one choice
You better choose to run
I had a soul of Makaveli
When you lose a lung
Take it from me
I make niggas learn respect
Disrespect hurt but pain is when I burn a tech
And it ain't nutttin like gettin ya head slittin ya wig
And the fed find you buried with your bitch and her kids
It was rough comin up nigga, I ain't eatin
You think Im tryin to turn the tables now, I ain't beat

Im finna do this, ride it out to the end
Rest In Peace to my niggas
Makaveli the don, Killa Kadafi

[Hook 2x]

God I'm droppin to my knees (to my knees)
My Rosaries in my hand
And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord Please) Rest In Peace
Gotta take the pain away
Will I live to see another day (another day)

Yellowcity That's where I'm from
Benzino My nigga
Young Heff - c'mon rock!

[Verse 1: Benzino]
Checking in the closet for my blue Velour suit
Piping all around it wit the matchin' Timb boots
Hop up in the wagon wit the 20 inch shoes on.. ohh
Riding down the street wit a twenty G stack
Shorty paging me saying "Zino where you at?"
Look up in the mirror 5-0 up on my back it's - uh ohh
Pull up in the spot smoking in the parking lot
Everybody having fun niggas don't stop
Pray to God that I don't have to let the guns pop it's
Maybe all the girls wanna chill wit Benz and Heff
Pushing up the bottle 'til there's no more Henny left
Step it up to Louie now let's see what happens next

[Hook: Mario Winans]
We gon' throw the party (yeah) rock the party (rock)
Then drink Bakardi (c'mon) freak somebody (freak)
Then leave the party to the after party y'all.. ohh

Then drink Bacardi freak somebody
Then leave the party to the after party y'all.. ohh
What we gon' do?!

[Verse 2: Benzino]
Lookin' at the shorty with the Frankie B. Jeans
Thong hanging out, butterfly belly ring
Butter leather boots with the tassels, that's mean - oh
Got up on that ass when she came up in the door
Rock it to the beat then we took it to the floor
DJ in the club spinning record back and forth - oh
People going hard cause you know the mood is right
Everybody screaming like they at a Tyson fight
Young Heff in the back wit a dime looking tight, oh-my - ohhh
Hit the sour diesel mami bouncing on my lap
VIP crowded so I take it to the back
Up in the coat room where you find 'Zino at
(And Mario too, yo)
Now everybody just

[Verse 3: Benzino]
5 in the morning more drinks at the crib
Whachu waiting for, mami? Get your ass in!
Hop up in the coupe, girls riding wit my friend
(Y-y-y-y-yo, y'all follow us, follow us)
Rolling through the city wit the CD on blast
Pull up at the mansion had to dip up in the stash
Scene looking sexy shorty got a fat ass, oh-my-God
Step up in the place everybody getting wet
Sweating on the floor dancing like they having sex
Popping Champagne taking bottles to the neck
Looking at my Jacob it's about that time
Sun's coming up bout to close the blinds
This is how we do almost everyday
Now meet me upstairs with Courvoisier

[Hook]

[Bridge - Eddie from Yellowcity] (2x)
What is a party if it don't rock?

A Yellowcity party, no it don't stop

[Hook]
If my pain don't speak my story, If these words don't speak my soul
If my struggle be the legacy, In this world if I let go
Is it the only thing that's constant is a change that's overdue?
If they fault me for my attitude, I'm just tryin to make it through

[Verse 2: Freddie Foxxx]
It's Bump Knucks from the underground still full of rage
Rhymes, I write 'em in blood, They spill through the page
I been on my Lillo Thomas, layin in the cut
Waitin for feds and snitches to move, Nigga what?
I'm a smooth nigga but, I'm extra deadly
I'm 45 minutes of gangster medley's
I'm a crook, to the heart B, Master the theft
Steal everything but air, I won't take ya breath
Y'all know, The 3 pound 7 cali revolve
Got a murder to solve, My heart was involved
I'm a thug nigga, I still say fuck a label
Fuck wit ray, And nigga you will duck a table
Krupt mob, My Nigga we bounce from the jake's
Tryin to turn into key's, The ounces we take
I'm a locman, Diamond, Rhymin godzilla
Wit the calico's cocked, You fuckin wit a killa

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Benzino]
Don't you ever think for a minute I wasn't comin back
Makaveli would never be on a Shady track
How could you ever insinuate the inprobable?
The number 1 rapper alive? How is it possible?
Runnin through these industry niggas like I was Ray Lewis
Never scurred to press on the trigger because I been through it
Tryin to keep me from flyin, They gonna let you do it
Only thing that kept me from dyin is makin rap music
Tell me what you hidin for, Was it miami on memorial day?
Up in the all-star in La, Super bowl sunday
We up in houston where niggas like the gunplay
And everybody's shootin, I'm a universal hood nigga, Me and Bumpy put it down
Wit Makaveli, These niggas wasn't even around
What's the difference between ya niggas and mine?
We was up in the studio wit the realist of all time

[Hook]Yeah, muthafuckas
It's time for the real Legion of Doom
Buddah Man, tell em we ain't havin it

[ Buddah Man ]
Yeah, silly rabbit
Fuck that shit
We ain't havin that this year
This is comin straight from the Bean, knawmean?
And we ain't havin that
[Name] Street live, muthafucka
Hey yo, Rhome, man, won't you drop that shit

[ VERSE 1: Tony Rhome ]
Yo, here we go again
On the strenght of L.O.D. I kick facts, and
Some are the reasons that I stay strapped in
Deal with the jealousy, bullshit, tryin to rush the stage
While I'm kickin a rhyme that's gonna get me paid
I got niggas who got my back while I tour
What's up, hold up, you can never fuck with the 4
Cause if you try to step, then my niggas gonna step too
Listen to the way I bring this, cause you might face the whole crew
Huh, and we'll be like 20 deep
So that's 20 muthafuckas comin straight from the streets
Nevertheless you been warned
Cause yo, I'm speakin up for my parts, and if you step, then it's on
And there'll be no holdin back
Niggas in gold and black
Who know nothin but dope and straps
And it's never for no reason
So prepare yourself, cause it'll be comin straight from the Legion

[ VERSE 2: Mass Murderer Mike ]
It's one of them niggas from the Brick
Packin a Tec, and quick to blast it
(A [Name] Street bastard) Sendin niggas to a casket
915s, my g-a-n-g makin noise
Us niggas from the Brick now wreckin shit with the (Badd Boyz)
Step to my crew, you get your dome flown and blown
I'm part of the Legion, so mutahfuckas shoulda known
That a nigga will back up, we pack, son
Now make room for Mass Murderer Mike
Straight from the Legion of Doom (No question)

[ VERSE 3: Big Roscoe & Mody ]
Big Roscoe's on his goal while I fuck around
Rippin niggas in half and tearin shit up when I go down
So let a nigga stroll
Cause niggas like to mow
Roll and throw, screamers
Hummin from my bitch Nina
Now Legion's in the house, so feel the violence
My Ace file up when I'm rollin with the muthafuckin black talents
Cause if you're cruisin for a brusin, then you're schemin for a beamin
Niggas done represented the G, but this one's for the Legion

[ VERSE 4: Kool Gsus ]
This is the Gsus Kool
Not the old or the new, I'm just straight up school
Cause niggas be soundin like dumbo
So I exit all the mumble-jumble
Cause I'm good at makin dumbo-gumbo
I makes you crumble
You had the ball, but fumbled
My Mac carries a rumble
Makin MC's tumble
I hates a faker as far as I can see em
So if you be him, then you get lynched by the Legion

[ VERSE 5: Fly Ty ]
I think you better make way for the joint, punk
Fuck around with the sound and get the head shrunk
It was a real bad move to stick your crew in, shit's gettin ruined
When you're fuckin with my boys, with the Bruins
Who you're think you're foolin? Not Ty
How really gotta die before I really get fly?
Hittin all sides with the slides, and I'm leavin
Everybody's doomed, comin straight from the Legion

(Hey yo, this is Raydog
I'm not here right now
Just leave your name and your number
Out)
(Hey yo, Dog, man, this is Beef
My bro, what happened, man?
We ain't goin out like that
Yo, we gots the shit, man
Hey yo, I'ma call Tone
Then I get back with you, man
Out)
(Yo man, this is the second time I call you, man
Get up, man, get up)

[ VERSE 6: Raydog ]
Hey yo, I be a nigga that you never could figure
With a dog on his chest and a stolen Trooper's vest
I represent a pack of niggas that'll kill quick
Like that, so suckers better get the fuck back
I bet you thought the Dog would never get another turn
But I'm the flame-thrower, so muthafuckas burn
You probably thought RSO's deep, well, you're right
We'll hit you up somethin fierce in a gunfight

[ VERSE 7: Tangg The Juice ]
Hey yo, Tangg's the ruffneck with the Tec hangin out the window
When they sleep on the T, smoke em like the endo
Niggas'll know when I pull, the whole patrol drop pants
On your blocvk with the Glock, nigga, that might be yo ass
So yo, don't ever call a nigga lazy
Cause all the B.P.D. know we all crazy
Cause everyday up in my hood it be the season for squeezin
Trust me, we'll be comin out the muthafuckin Legion

[ VERSE 8: E-Devious ]
Yo, we the Legion, but they labelled us the gangbang thugs
Who do nothin more than shoot shit and sell drugs
Mad niggas who do a lotta cursin
Strapped down with automatics on they person
With attitudes like: 'I don't give a fuck about you
Cause you don't give a fuck about me, gee'
That's how it is, yo, shit don't never be right
That's why we cross a gun with a mic
So I ain't makin friends, so fuck sayin 'what up'
Cause I pull my pump, and then I blow your gut up
So watch it when you talk shit, cause if I flip
I be on some old _King Of New York_ shit
And ain't nothin nice about that
Cause my crew is much deeper than Top Cat's
Huh, I'm E-Devious, never leavin shit alone
Word to Doom, it's comin from the Legion, homes[Black R] Yeah baby it's time to pump the bottle, baby

Me and Black like big Shaq in the paint
We do it from Cleveland to Oakland, down to LA, VA and back to NC

[Black Rob]
Yo, best done, who done popped up out of hiding
Snuck out the bowels of Gotham, who gone stop em'?
The body mask wore eighty-fives, all solid
It's all roll-ed, let's get this green like its call-ed
I floss a lot black and get to Boston I'm hot
Acting like I won't bring the black Porsche off the lot
Then do the right thing, y'all know Ray, y'all know Jinx
I'm like the night wing with the iced out bright wing
Go ahead dog, sleeping I'm a steal ya plate
Brought Ray and Made Men out to seal ya fate
More ya ta none, beef, might borrow ya guns
I borrow ya funds, dog we'll spoil your fun
Eastside I lay at, I'm like whoa! when ya play that
I'm not a killer cat to fix his mouth and say that
Bad Boy, Made Mens and high living
I'm outta here, streets, stay out of prison

[Hook]
[Black Rob]
If ya real, ya real, if ya ain't, ya ain't

If ya real, ya real, if ya ain't, ya ain't
Me and Black like big Shaq in the paint
We do it from Cleveland to Oakland, down to LA, VA and back to NC

[Benzino]
Four, five, sixes, arm tight bitches
The middle finger's up to all my critics
Flow so vicious, hate taking pictures
I ain't feelin' niggas who fuckin' with the snitches
Hit you out the park like Manny, y'all can't stand me
Won't see me at the Grammy's
My team stunning, the high beams are coming
Doors flying open, my team start thumping
Leave your boys crawling
Who got your back, call em'
Problems resolve them, there not that important
The last one standing, you the first one leaving
The first one bleeding, now who the one breathing?
Ninety-five south, don't ever try and follow
Fuck around, get hit by the hollow
Ray Benzino, Grand Marciano, Bad Boys, Made Men live at the Apollo

[Hook x2]

Blood, slugs, murder, jail

I have you niggas buyin guns, for real
Pattin on 'em, might pop up and lay things down

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Benzino]
I spend my whole life tryin to get paid for this
I watched Rock get slayed for this
I kept it gangsta - niggas.. don't.. want.. it
Betta yet, motherfuckers can't take it
Strike back so there whole squad suffer
Attack niggas til they can't get enough of...
I got RSO blood in my vein
Made Men take it there, for see no pain
I run with niggas that see no pain
And cock them things, dip quick in the Range
Unsolved murderers, cold case niggas
Undescribable, when we squeeze those triggers
Invisible like night glove
Shine like a nickel four-fifth, bitch slang to this, c'mon

[Hook]

[Bars & Hooks]
Yeah, it's real ill when a classic album drop
But it's real fucked up when a classic album flop
And your sweet dreams turn into nightmares - your plans get crushed
It seems like the grands been flushed
But since it's all for diniero, you can't give up
We gotta keep hope alive and, keep strivin
Keep scribin, and don't give up til we Diamond
If any nigga get in our way squeeze iron

[Bars & Hooks]
Yeah, we gang bang him, we shoot him til we dyin
Act like a nigga said "Bars", and empty out fry him
Shoot that nigga, cut that nigga til we dyin
Cause he wanted to lay down, and we couldn't deny him
So nigga, get up out or way, we don't play
Ain't no nigga, ain't no bitch, ain't nobody I won't spray
You niggas is ass, my niggas is Made, y'all mens is two throat, my niggas is too big

Uh, Check it out
Here it goes

[Mr. Gzus]
Step up in the club, what did I see?
B double O double T double E
All 'round me
Duckin the tricks around me
Look it's soft as Downey
Never wait for the plug, she found me
As I nod to the beat, and down some Re-mi
Gettin tit-ty, smokin minty, gettin crispy
Dimes in line from the shine, they can't miss me
I rep the 3, Benzino and Twice G
I rep the Bean, I hold it down for my team
Make no mistakes, I wanna rake that backyard
Keepin mad links in the 'yac (?)
Lord, Lord, check the design
Joe Dash but I'm tryin to make that ass mine
Player always on the grind scopin some take home
Creepin, bonin, see you in the mo'nin

[Chorus - Teddy Riley]
Booty, booty
Booty, booty
I see booty
I see booty

[Teddy Riley]
Uh, aiyyo, it's time to shake that ass baby
Wiggle it and make it last baby
Take it off and I'll give you a little cash baby
Booty bangin like the bass in the cape, uh
Call your friends, come and hang with my click, uh
Come to the mansion with that think and them tits, uh
You can get it if you slimmer your thick, uh
Aiyyo it's T.R., I be the dude from the east
Collaboration with the Made man, movin ya feet
Aiyyo my party people dance to this (uh)
Get ya roll on, wave ya hands to this (what)
Ladies show ya thong, drop ya pants to this (wha-what)
Hop inside the Benz and get tampered with
You can get it even if your glamourous, feel me, feel me?
The way you shake that ass it's like you tryin to kill me
I'm with the sex you need, so baby heal me
Teddy Ted and Made Men, what you forgot me

[Chorus]

[Benzino]
Boottee ass niggas that's there for blastin
Smith and Wesson turn ya into ashes
Assassin, that's me if ya askin
Get ya frame bent up, wrapped in plastic
Who got the game mastered? Benzino, bastard
I lasted, stepped the game up and passed it
Boottee ass niggas wanna do this thug shit
Flash all night but your jewels are busted
We cop bottles, flocks, my motto's
Benzino's 'bout to drop, and that's a problem
Matta fact, that's a promise
You spit trash, your man is garbage
I whip cars, fast and forty
7 Class, six sedans aboard us
Boottee ass niggas wanna please the ass man
Fake copin whips, no cash protection
Get outta here!

[Chorus]

[Benzino] 3x
Ridin thru these streets in my Range, and all I see is..
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Pull up to the club on dubs, and look at here
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Bitch type niggas try to creep, they whole crew..
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Don't cock block, stick a dime in the G for the..
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)

[Teddy Riley] 8x
I see booty, I see booty[Intro]
Yeah, yeah Storch
That's what I'm talkin' about, my nigga
Bottles & up, TS what up, nigga?
Bottles & up, O's and G's know

[Hook]
Bottles in the air, middle fingers to the sky
My niggas don't dance cause we all gettin' high
Semi on the waist, two-steppin' on the side
Keep gettin' money till the day that I die (2x)

(Thug the club!)
Shawty what, get buck
(Thug the club!)
Real G's roll up
(Thug the club!)
Fight it out, get drunk
(Thug the club!)
Act wild, tear it up

[Verse 1]
Introducin' the Nemesis, you've heard of me
Enter the rebel, the legend, the "Rock the Party" took me to another level
I'm a bad mothafucka, stones colored, illuminatin'
Pull up to the joint and the girls love it, the niggas hate it
Unstoppable, position myself to get cheddar
Incredible with these lyrics, I'm only gettin' better
I'm on a sour, my niggas, we poppin' vouf man
Don't want no bottles for niggas, you 'bout to lose, man
Buyin' bottles for brodies, you know it's nothin', dawg
Crush you something later fo'sho, she breakin' somethin' off
Soon as Zino step through the door she got it jumpin' off
Grab your chick and head to the floor, I'm callin' all of y'all!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Most of my niggas got felonies, we's haulin' at the bar
Throwin' Hypno and Hennessy, she fuckin' with the Hulk
We continue to roll and blow the best trees
Puff an ounce in the club, lookin' for sour D's
Plus downin' bottles of bub like it was ice tea
Only bottles & up, that's if you like me, you got keys!
I'm feelin' lucky like a Celtic clover
Lil' spit, Lil' Flip, now the game is over!
I'm on a mission ain't finishin' 'til I'm done
Make the crowd move wild like I'm bustin' the gun
Everybody hallucinatin', somebody set it off
You're callin' security, now it's (?)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Apologies are never accepted, I'm on another level
Probably try to get me arrested because I'm so ghetto
So many victims from homicide
Accountable for only thorough niggas
Who want to ride or die with me
Poured a bottle out for homies who ain't here
Incarcerated niggas with numbers be givin' mad years
I'm number 34, beyond all the glory
I'm the truth like the "E! True Hollywood Stories," nigga
Zino king of the city, I'm 'bout to lock it down
Silly rap get smacked, let's get it poppin' now
Big dog and I do it the best
I'm in the club with a cold million dead on my chest

[Hook]

[Outro]
(Bottles & up!)
Boston get it poppin'

Un hun, un hun-un
Un hun, un hun-un
Un hun, un hun-un

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yeah, aiyyo
We can do whatever you want to, I promise
Fight, play razor tag or spit lamas
I'm two guns up over the roof
Hopin at least one hit your upper gums over your tooth
Cuz a lot of niggas jus talkin
Wanna kill a nigga on a record, when they see 'em they jus talkin
In my case, I'ma jus hawk 'em
Cuz niggas is waitin for a lawsuit, it's hot and they walkin
They sendin dudes up like clockwork
Niggas that can't hold it down usually come home with artwork
Ain't no such thing as a smart jerk
Then again, one fuckin dumb-dumb can make your heart jerk
D-Block nigga, we got work
That old school grey shit, uncut, got niggas pops hurt
You ran off Broadway, I get top work
Minority report, you don't know what you got murk, that's why..

[Chorus: Benzino]
Everybody wanna call your name
Until you squeeze them chromey thangs
Everybody wanna call you out
Until you pull up at the house
And everybody wanna try and bluff
Go head nigga press your luck, what's up?
And everybody wanna call your name
Don't wait, jus please call my name

[Jadakiss]
Dear God I got eighty five forty five bullets in the Tommy
With a extra thirty clip in my back pocket so try me
I'm on the yellow lines on one knee
Tryna hit a nigga in a building in One-D
Yeah, D-Block, you hatin the unity
I bring it to your motherfuckin gated community
In case you ever get it in your mind again
Twenty lil dirty niggas, with no guns throwin Heinekens

[Benzino]
By the time you hear this verse, I done staked you out
Me, V nailed and hearse, layin at your house
We screwin silencers, put a muzzle on that AK
Rip that nigga shit in half, make that bitch pay
Annihilate, every piece of ground you walk on
No need to talk on coward, I get my chalk on
It's always one nigga on the side
Talkin out his mouth next thing you know he bleedin from his side

[Chorus]

[Benzino]
Are you crazy?  I was in the dirt since '87
If war is hell, then will I ever go to heaven?
The D duck, Zino bring the Tommy when I re-up
Four and a half is nothin, get your ki's up
You boys stop bluffin, before you get beat up
Take your car keys, throw your ass in the trunk
Slide off with your bitch, L.E.S. track bump
Cats still can't figure me out (What?)
Askin how this nigga in the game gained so much clout?
Fuck whoever wanna claim king, I lay you down
Take your chain and your ring, you can keep the crown
I told your man the same thing, he can eat these rounds
Lacerate your face, pistol whip you unconscious
Your block never did so I know you can't want this
You rap a good one, but I see it in your eyes
You like to bang on wax cuz you don't wanna die

[Chorus]

[Outro: Benzino]
Un hun, un hun-un
Un hun, un hun-un
Un hun, un hun-un[Napoleon (Benzino)]
Don't worry soulja (Made Men, Outlawz)
Yo, pain ain't nuthin but a part of the game
They got us real fucked up
Ain't nuthin but a part of the game, deal wit it

[Napoleon]
Life -- is a hustle, I got my .45 waitin to bubble
I lost a lot of my loved ones to the struggle
It's like I'm holdin back my breath through a muzzle
It's like I got one more piece to complete the puzzle
You only got one chance cuz I don't love you
And I'll be boned if I cock back and slug you
For all my dead niggas, that's above you
It's like a feud, my family ain't around they done
And if I lose one more soulja I'ma drown someone
Who Makaveli? I give you eight to ya belly
For Killa Khadafi, please tell the cops to stop me
My brother Seeky, I'ma ride all night for ya
And do the same for Gustafa and Big Mike soulja
This to my main man comin from a Made nigga
I feel your pain, hold ya head, let's get paid nigga

[Benzino]
Yo hear my number Polly, call me
And anytime you wanna talk about the situation, involve me
I understand just what your goin through
I lost niggas too.. I shed tears too..
I can't cry no more, yo Tony what'chu die for?
Three strike 915 is what I ride for
You and Roc hold it down, we aight (we aight)
We with the Outlawz, sippin Henny all night
Been goin through that shit since day one
I think I live this long, cuz I live by the gun
But that's the question, I know my life is dee-per so feel me
Cheated death many times when niggas tryed to kill me

[Chorus - Young Noble]
I feel yo' pain! - Sick torment 'til he's guarded
Keep us caged like dogs, go to shit in the yard
I feel yo' pain! - Drownin in the rain and shit
The only thing that's fucked up, we can't change this shit
I feel yo' pain! - Nigga yo I'm just like them
When I was broke on the block I had clips like them
I feel yo' pain! - Speak it to ya straight from the heart
No matter what you come across you gotta live, get lost

[Kastro]
Ain't nothin to fear in this love affair, when shared with the streets
I'm in deep losin all kinds of sleep
Ain't no love, so my eyes don't blink
And I'm so shell-shocked I need to see a shrink
It stink, stinks so much I can't think
And when it hurts too bad, I numb it up with a drink
And chase my liqour with a bad temper
Too fuckin blind for the big picture
Losin my mind, it's just a sign of the times
And when my loved ones go, part of my insides dying wit 'em
Shit, ain't nobody to blame, can't nobody complain
Can you feel my pain?

[E.D.I.]
Would you look into my world and tell me what you see now?
Nothing but emptiness, God replinish this
Fuckin with Devils shit I'm tryna stay righteous
Losin my love I ain't felt pain like this
Start of this motherfuckin game wasn't nice shit
I fuck around lost the one thing priceless
Cars and broads won't do, dawg'll slice shit
I'm just passin the time until my number hit
Fuck it I'll run wit it, until I feel I'm done wit it
Stack up the ones and let my sons come up rich
Clutchin a piece of the past, I move on
Using this pain to keep a nigga strong

[Chorus - Young Noble] 2x

I feel it...[Snoop Dogg]

Throwin dicks to dykes, turnin out virgins
So fuck your coupe, it's Scarface and Snoop
Up in Bing-town snatchin bitches off the mini six-deuce
And sue dat dame, with "Tru dat" game
Get her ass naked, and black-n-blue that thang
The news that came was the Made Men wattn't
But the paper was the influence and that's what done it
You cuff these hoes, we muff these hoes
You and Captain Save Ya Baby Mother, FUCK these hoes

Fuck a bus - we private jet Motown

Hold up, you shakin it fast, bitch slow down
Blaze shots for the gangster in me
You scared to carry heat, don't hang with me (Motherfucker)
Big guns, no thang to me

Just to make this shit more hotter
So tighten up your training wheels bitch...

Uh.......Hangmen 3 (Gangsta jugga)

Pray on it sober, I'm just another step closer
Niggas'll ghost ya, found out these'll hurt ya
Play it frank while I lay in the Beam, let the heat roast ya
I'm moralized street solider, I thought the streets told ya
Thug slash beat composer, Nights filled wit freaks and doser
Went from rags to riches, don't fuck with snitches
My Benz keeps the baddest bitches, huggin the block
Hollow tips sluggin the Glock, hollerin "Who let the thug in the spot"
BENZINO!!!!!! (Bitches, clips, guns) Black out, inhale blow it back out (*deep breathin*)
Take shorty to the 'Tel blow her back out
And y'all motherfuckers better not act out
I go the cash route, plus bet on mash out
Burn rubber and leave you niggas assed out

Hook:
G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R, I-B-E-A-C-I-A-O

(iaaaaaaaahaha iaaahahahahaa) Chief rocker, whole tribe flooded out
He don't know you better tell your man cut it out
I'm workin with a short fuse you can't put it out
Big money, big guns that's what I'm about
...Deep concentration, I'm at a level that niggas can't get to
Grab a shovel, big meat you might get through
I'm gangsta part gorilla, part pit bull
I never start a situation that I can't finish
In other words this dog means business
Trendsetter, simple and plan, the first in rap music wit a crew on his chain
Still do it for my men behind bars, LIFERS
From Wallpoles to Ricards, push Benz's befo I got my license
And I'm coming for them belts like Tyson
We vultures, street bred, king cobras
Keep focus, smoke weed, sip Coronas
Spit chorus, bitches can't ignore us
The saga ends, you can't do nothing for us

Hook:
G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R, I-B-E-A-C-I-A-O

(iaaaaahahahaa iaaahahahaa) *Scratching* Most dangerous, Benzino is m-m-most dangerous, most violent...most dangerous, Benzino is m-m-most dangerous, most violent...most dangerous, Benzino is m-m-most dangerous, most violent.....................Dro in a blunt twist it up, put four in your gut twist you up
You ain't heard not guilty's the verdict (the verdict echoes)
