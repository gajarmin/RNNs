[Intro: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Round everybody up - Twiztid, Blaze, The R.O.C
I got a letter from the goverment
The other day I opened it and read and said it was bitches
- Cold 187, Legz Diamond, Anybody Killa, Doe Dubbla and ICP
A letter to the FBI

[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Somebody call 911 they gangbangin at the mall
A kid 14 and his boys from Omaha
Oh lord, Oh my God hes on a skateboard
FBI guy up in the tree... snore
Spying on the juggalo clique for 8 months
Undercover, ain't got nuttin, straight punks
Waisting everybody goddamn time and money
Cause you're some old out dated cops tubs and sonnies
Shit-headed and nerdy, like it ain't even funny
And the bitch in your ass is like bees to honey
Calling juggalo a gangbanger? - Outrageous
Pulling ninjas over whipping out gages
And the judge slams down the hammers
To the big house now for you gangbanger
If we let this be, we'll be face to face
With one man as he dictates the human race
Speak outta line, they coming at a zoomin pace
Kick you when you down, boots, two to the face
We don't need that, so don't give in now
Fuck the FBI it's how I'm livin', BLOW!


[Verse 2: Violent J]
Mr. FBI, Mr. Officer
Tell me why you want me in the coffin sir
Is it because I wear my hatchet tat
Or cause me and my fellas got matching chat
Is it because we like to hang out and be scrubs
Must be thugs out here peddling drugs
Well let me tell ya, all that meddling does
Is make us wanna leave you embedded in slugs
Free speech motherfucker, check this out
I want some pussy, or I'mma shot a cop in the mouth
Bang, guts hang like a wicked video game
It's all the same it's entertainment and it ain't for the lame
They can't get us so they come for those who walk wit us
Punish you for representin, make you wanna forget us
That's what we get, cause we ain't corporate
Self made and doing well so they damn us to hell
And degrade us, that’s what made us, they say the world hate us
For 20 years I've been getting paid to bust
Call me an old man, I call me long dick paid
Young sweet baby Violent J never gets played


[Verse 3: The R.O.C.]
Tensions high in new america, goddamn what's all of this?
So I walk around with mouth full of shit, spittin' shit
In the face lady liberty pushing swiftly through these days
In a block 300 looking like I'm straight about to bat cave
Government they now investigate so uptain
To windows looking too close will get you sketched, no incidental
Residential neighborhoods on high alert for the insane clowns
Anybody killing you get twisted and bound
Then set a blaze and murdered dummy
The Colds 187 don't just doubles every second
Who's the weapon? I am the R.O.C.!
A house full of skinny jeans, I'm kept in debris
I'm a disease and a cure for you sick and healthy M.C.'s
No resurrection from the clique, we gonna stay up underground
Saluting, never letting cock suckers putting us youth truth
The booth is a star, I walk the heavens keep it locked
We gon' rob the solar system on the shit until you stop


[Hook: Legz Diamond]
You can hurt our name
You can't solve our game
Fuck you and your claim
We don't bang, we're family!

[Verse 4: Cold 187um]
I'll pull a Tec' on you quick, I would say "fuck a bitch"
I spit, gangsta shit, I've been federally indicted, uh
I'mma killa from the west, don't test
Blaow, 187, the psychopathic
I come through, shut shit down, no bitch up now
I specialize in moving big dope and lettin' off rounds
So fuck the FBI, you know why they took 41 months of my life
Uh, that's why I ride or do or die, hustle world wide
Kick your door in, get your guap and back to the west side
No witnesses, a bloody homicide
Cause believe me, when I step ain't nobody gon' be left alive
The type of gangsta that plays for keeps, up deep in the streets
I got them bowls and birds for dirt cheep
So catch me in a old school classic
Reppin' the juggalos and everybody down with the hatchet

[Verse 5: Anybody Killa]
F is for the fools, B for bringing bullshit
I is my reply so yes, I feel included
Times really ain't changed, fans they says deranged
Music is the devil, and the artist is to blame
Juggalo I role, underground I stroll
Family is forever so this family will grow
I’m the FBI, Full blooded Indian
Back ready to ride, native pride once again
It's official, I had to go buy a new pistol
Just in case I hear the pigs whistle
Pull me over for a fucking purpose
Not because you worthless
Feeling like a criminal because I'm spittin' verses
Doctors, lawyers, dads and moms
Representin Juggalo cause they know it's the bomb
You can't stop psychopathic, the hatchet we jump hurdles
Even if you brought Elvis from the dead is John Burroughs

[Verse 6: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Don't blame me, not buildin a Bradley, it’s sad to see
You runnin your mouth and harassing the family
Trying to burn down my tree, cuttin' off branches
Like timber if you had it your way we'd be a cinder
You're far from heroic, you can't beat the stoic look on my face
As it changed from disdain to hate
Why you're spittin' your pulpit, I want to see your pores spit
All over the place till we're covered in all it
Toxic, no cure or antibiotics
You think we are so sick, we know you're neurotic
A build of psychotics, that drink and smoke chronic
Bitch you talking all that jazz, that's so sided

[Hook: Legz Diamond]

[Verse 7: Doe Dubbla]
Watch me blast off, laughin my ass off
Callin us a gang? Y'all high off bath salts
We hot as asphalt, they watchin us on every level
What if they told that you can't listen to heavy metal
What if they told that you had listen to the devil?
Fuck what they tell you, we some rebels so they persecute
We don't confirm the policies, so they hurt the youth
Cause we free thinkin, smokin tree, drinkin
They wanna catch us sleepin we ain't even blinkin
Fuck the feds, all my life they some suckas
I really think they mad, cause their wives wanna fuck us
The government don't wanna see me on some psycho shit
It's worse than the freeway sniper mixed with Michael Vic
Now they all fucked, wanna catch us in the twist
J Edgar Hoover you can suck the motherfuckin dick
And we ain't stopping till you take us off the fucking list

[Verse 8: Jamie Madrox]
Now I've been hustlin' and gridin' since I was new to the game
Before the songs and the videos and the screamin' the name
Before the diamond crusted hatchetman is swung from the chain
And I was greater than business, and all the trick to the trade
Learn to live it like I spit it, it's a family affair
A million painted faces in the crowd with hands in the air
All here to love us from above, and the devil rightly beneath
But the evil stares and shit talking can never compete
They wanna take us out the game and even call it a gang
Checking for tattoos and car stickers studyin slang
Man it's amazing how ridiculous this shit has became
Hoping that pride will go away but ours is strong and insane
It's only greater if anything below get heavy
But the goal stay the same, put the worries in the levy
People tell us everyday that we're the reason they survive
The true incentive of deeper hope alive, we don't die!

[Verse 9: Monoxide]
I been on that - fuck the law, middle finger to em all
A bitch who a line stepper, or a criminal rhyme shredder
Put a gun to your jaw, and make the world better
But instead I just shoot for the cheddar
And I can make you pearl jam and in my waist the Eddie Vedder
Looking for more them a bad rapper, I'm forever
Like Birdman baby, I'm so cash money
And the feds wanna ruin all that, now that's funny
I'll put a 5 hole in the 5-0
And I'm liable to emulate the face of a killa for my survival
Flat line your vitals, and I'm dangerous, and labeled a psycho
That ain't even the reason, they wanna keep us from the mic tho
My freedom of speech is what I would die for
FBI's my life long rival, cross-hairs and in scope of my rifle

[Hook: Legz Diamond][Verse 1: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
You know I smoke weed, it burns, I exhale
I'm high right now, who the fuck you gon' tell?
You can probably smell aromas comin' on strong
Like the stench of the water in the bottom of my bong
Ain't no peace for 'get along', no I'm not a flower child
.45 up in my waist, you poppin' off, we gettin' (wild!)
Give me room in the zoom that I'm gone off the keyshia cole
Eyes closed, holding back the choke cause my lungs is full
Pass the shit, get it back again for another bowl
Smoking like a chimney cause there ain't no carbonation ho
Nothing in the room but clouds far as I can see
You wanna get high with me?

[Hook: Dominic]
A couple pounds burning up
I owe that loud
Mixed with that swerve in my cup
So high I can't come down
And I'm shit-faced, yes I'm wasted
I'm shit-faced

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
How many times can I chime rhymes with a fried mind?
Is what you're thinking with every line that you rewind of mine
Let me remind that in order to walk the border of evil
I'm burning quarters at the speed that a racecar drive
I get abnormally high but inside
I'm transforming like I was Optimus Prime
But the form that I reside is a crime lord
With an eye four times the size of any kinda cyborg y'all can find
Feel like I wanna go play on the dark side
So I got my little bag of that cloud nine
And I'll start by taking a short drive to the cemetery
And then I'mma park, right, get a flashlight in a grave site
And then I'll be ready to spark mine with a great time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Yo Blaze, Monoxide
Y'all motherfuckers held it down for the weed heads, but what about the alcoholics?
Let's go!

Roamin' with the airlines as I'm floatin', drinkin' Cognac
Big glass, no ice, to the rim, I’m in, pushing my wig back
It’s time to sit back, 4 hours till last call
I got a pocket full of hundreds, I'm thirsty, I came to ball (Bouncin'!)
Do I tip or double pour double ounces?
Bottle here, bottle there, I swear I'll share
That's really where it counts
There's a party where I'm sittin'
I'm soaking up all the liquid
Alcohol, yeah I'm addicted
My advice train is shiftin'
I went from doobies to blunts, a bowl to a bong
Now they're toking it, they did even ripped it up in our songs
It's impossible to be hard, sippin' cocktails, two straws
But I’m granted, don’t understand it
Managed to pulled it off for alcohol

[Bridge: Dominic]
We got the sticky in the back
Hennessy on my lap, I'm sippin' out the snifter

[Hook][Intro]
You got ?nine dollars? with yourself. You’ve got a world ahead of you whether you like it or not. You’ve got to choose things. You’ve got to get up and go, through all kinds of change. Whether you want to or not doesn’t matter

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
And I can feel it now
It's more obvious than ever there's a problem
And I better try to figure out
If I'm willing ta solve em
Or ignore em like a middle child
Seems like it's been awhile
Since I had an answer to one of life's riddles, I'm riddled out
And now I'm stuck in this mental house and these four walls
Are driving me crazy and I'm begging em all
To take a different route, somebody save me
All I see is madness on the daily
It's getting out of hand like droppin a baby
All the pills I keep slappin away when they try to medicate me
I'm a danger to my safety and my angers
Got me strapped in a jacket at most times and lately
I re-act to the fact that it's all here to change me
With a middle finger right to the face and stay the same me

[Hook: Blaze]
(Lift me up)
In life the pressure so heavy that I feel I fallen to the wayside
If only I can get away from everything
Spread my wings and then fly
(Lift me up)
I know I wasn't born on this earth to become a failure and die
If only I can get away from everything
Spread my wings and then fly
(Lift me up)

[Verse 2: Madrox]
Our life is unclear shed a heavenly tear
For father we still toughen it out down here
In the midst of mankind
Where money's so tight they cuttin' throats
For pennies nickels and dimes
Hard to walk a straight line
When the road curves like a snake
And most leaders are cowards, liars and fakes
Who shall I follow in fear I pose a question
Your response, stay strong son and pick a direction
I'm not sure if I possess the confidence to carry on
I'm only here for today and tomorrow we'll be gone
It's an example of scenarios
Use your time to leave a mark stronger
Than a miracle felt in a soul
To a believer, you don't have to say it twice
To a skeptic, I'm sure no proof will ever suffice
To a sinner, it was over before it ever began
To the lost and lonely, sometimes we only need a friend

[Hook: Blaze]

[Verse 3: Madrox]
You can't stop greatness
It has a way of shining through any gimmick or fake shit
My aspirations to make it
Don't make it easy for somebody
Trying to do it for real better believe me
Fly with me flap your wings slow
Feel the ground beneath your feet begin to go
Away from me I'm excited with energy
A vision of clarity rise above the storm for solidarity

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
And your popularity is a drop in the Bearing sea
And apparently your nothing but average
I'm a dangerous package
Drown you all in my daydream
I'm laughing like a jackal
As I spread my wings and elevate free
I know you hate me
But in the grand scheme deep in your heart you wanna thank me
Cause we're the same we
All looking for escape from pretty much the same things

[Hook: Blaze]

[Outro]
The spiritual world is where I live, I exist in places you’ve never even dreamed of. You talk about, you know, this little physical realm you live in… guilty in… is in sin. Wha- How’s your courts guilty? How many people do you think you’ve hung on the ventilators, in another words and forced medication on em. You see what I’m saying? You don’t have any idea what the hell’s going on. If you knew what the hell was going on in your own system then you’d say “Oh, now I see what’s created me…[Intro: Violent J]
Hound dog ass muthafucka…
Raise up off my nizzos
Get off my nuts!
Get off me bitch!

[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Shit, muthafuckin hound dogs, what?
Swingin from my balls so hard, it's like I got a third nut
And look, I don’t care who you know, bitch
Lookin fine, get the fuck to the back of the line
Lyin to hoes, sayin you my cousin
Like my momma and your momma are sisters or somethin
Oh yeah, we down, go ahead, let 'em in
Blah! Knuckle hammers to the chin
Be down with me and I’ll be down back
Put my dick in your mouth? You’re gonna hear your neck snap (CRACK!)
In fact ho, fuck out my bus!
Ask questions like a mutt but ain’t down to fuck? (no)
You see ‘em go, you see ‘em go, you see ‘em come again
From my dick to Twiztid's dick, and then
To Violent J's dick to Blaze's Dick, try to grope us with they paws
Goddamn hound dogs!

[Hook x2]
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Hound dogs ain't got shit to say
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Give a dog a bone, give a dog a bone

[Verse 2: Monoxide Child]
What's the whole meanin of a hound dog? (What?)
Butt sniffin, dick lickin, all kinda rub y’all
I’m in a club, smokin on a square
Step on out to get a little fresh air
But I can't do that, I get attacked like a cardiac
People rushin front to back, they’re like "Sign that"
Ain't nothin wrong with givin me props
But actin like the punk ass cops
And swingin off my nuts has gotta stop
Walk around, spreadin rumors like you know
Sayin shit you heard me tell a ho, after a show
Homie, I don’t play that shit one bit
Fuck around and get your head cut off rite quick
Psychopathic bitch boy, peep the axe
Specializing in splittin the hound dog backs
Plottin against the whole world in facts
So get off my dick, and I’m out like that!

[Interlude 1]
[Jamie Madrox]
Alright y’all

[Random hound dog]
Wait, come here!
Oh my God, you don’t remember me?

[Jamie Madrox]
Nah...

[Random hound dog]
I had a crush on you for like, nine years…

[Jamie Madrox]
I don’t know you fat bitch!

[Random hound dog]
It's me, Jenny!
I sat behind you in Ms. Croberry's chemistry class

[Jamie Madrox]
Bitch I ain’t even go to school!

[Random hound dog]
No, I’m saying if you were to sit there
It would have been the shit
Umm, you think you could sign my shirt?

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Yeah, I remember school
Hoes back then was like "Joe Bruce? Ewwww!"
Years pass by, and look I’m a star
Now all them hoes like "Joe Bruce? Ahhhh"
I’m still that nerdy ass voodoo nut
Now I got hound dogs sniffin my butt
I could have a worm hangin out of my dick hole
And they’d be like "Well I think it's cute though"
Miss me with all that, I ain't changed any
Look at me, I make Big Pun look skinny
I’m ugly as fuck, resembling a Klingon
Hoes still let me get my ding-a-ling-a-swing on
What up with these pop kids buyin my shit?
Mainstream groupies, get off my dick!
I wanna see real Juggalos at shows
Fuck these Backstreet richy fake hoes!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Y'all don’t even know who the fuck I am
Yet bitches like "Who’s his friend?" Goddamn!
My lips is crusty, my feets is musty
Lift up my nuts and my inch is dusty
I ain't had pussy in eleven years
I been dead, ain't nobody sheddin tears
Look bitch, I don’t give a fuck about fame
Glock cocked for you bitches, cause I’m married to the game
Ain't no shame to the shit I speak
Slap hound dog bitches in they face for weeks, freak
I see you hatin on my Raiders cap
When back in the day you was all about that (Sure was)
Shot that ass out back in ‘89
Buried wearin Locs and this clock of mine
Rose from the dead with the Lotus clique
My guns played out, and I ain't changing shit! (nope)

[Interlude 2]
[Random hound dog]
Hey, aren't you Monoxide Child?

[Monoxide Child]
That's right bitch

[Random hound dog]
Right....the skinny one
My best friend John supposed to be cousins with you or something

[Monoxide Child]
Who?

[Random hound dog]
So like, I figured if you give me your phone number
I can give it to him, and maybe we can all hang out or something

(Monoxide Child]
Shiiiit

[Random hound dog]
Whatever
Oh my God it's Blaze!
HEY DEAD HOMIE!

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
You’s a hound dog bitch, and I will smack your face
Ridin on my dick, now how my nuts taste?
Every place that I go somebody want a photograph
Or an autograph or “Can I get a dap?”
“How did y’all get started, y’all shit is really tight”
“And what be motivatin y’all to grab a pen and write?”
Listen hear lil bitch, I’m the killer in disguise
Twiztid muthafucka with the milk white eyes
I despise how you try to perpetrate like a Juggalo
But you ain't down, muthafucka, you’s a Jugga-ho
Hey ho you’re afraid of the facts
Never packin a gat, and always seen with an axe
Take another picture and I’ll break your jaw
I got an eighty pound punch for each and every one of y’all
Muthafuckas with the bitch ass hound dog face
My ass crack's exposed, go on ‘head and get a taste

[Hook x2]

[Verse 6: Violent J]
Muthafuckin hound dogs muthafucka
I got more shit to say
It be the same hound dogs in different cities
Starin at me like I’m a set of titties
Autographin T-shirts, hats, and socks
And this bitch don’t even know Riddle Box
Real Juggalos don’t want no picture
They just walk up like "What up Ninja!?"
After that, they give a fuck where I’m headin
They're like “Fuck him, we’re lookin for neden”
And I don’t need any more free tattoos
Got my arms looking like Motley Crue's
I can be talking to the finest bitch in the land
And you run up like "Hey, what up man?"
That's when I slap you right on the spot
And have Billy Bill beat you down in the parking lot
Do I think I’m better cuz neden comes easy?
Fo-sheezy, bitch!
Bottom line y’alls
Get off our balls
Psychopathic out like Biggie-Smalls

Can't fuck with Dark Lotus little Biiiiiitch!Stay out!

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
You couldn’t see the clearing from the road
So, alone I sit, my legs folded and eyes closed
This is the place that I go
To come to grips that my sanity’s juxtaposed
With insanity, overload
And I’m afraid, a vessel
When I’m back here, I’m all alone
There ain’t no screaming for help
When you're gone, they’ll never know

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
All the way to the drowning
Heavy stick in my hand and my heart, it keeps pounding
I'm holding them under
And their faces turn blue and I'm watching for wonder
See I hunt them like wild lions
And I catch em and kill em and cut em with hunting knife
Taxidermy like Mormons
Stuff their body with leaves and replace vital organs
The thing that's important
Is to never dispose of the edible organs
Delicious and morbid like a bucket of blood and a handful of organs
A place in the woods, where no one
Will hear you dying or seeing you live again
Rest here, you're home now, I'll keep you here with all of them

[Hook]
Sometimes when you look in the woods, the woods... Look back
"I don't like to be-" there's no one in the…
I am the woods
Do you believe in the devil?
I- I shouldn't of gone in there
Stop going there, -do you go in there for?
"Hey, stay out of the woods!"

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Off in the shadows on darkest of nights
There stands the heartless, his targets in sight
Underbrush overgrown, death stays hidden
Moss growth camouflage, body parts missin'
Trophy collection connected to the prize
Like to hear em scream, always look em in the eyes
Wear my disguise, it's the face of a victim
Get excited everytime my knife sticks 'em
Watch em die in a place in the woods, the sensation feel so good
Drag em to the cabin, singing and laughing
Addicted to the feelin', so appealin' is the killin'

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
I'm taking them antlers, night is black as a panther
Lost in the rapture as I torture the victim I've captured
No hearin' the screams of me stabbin' behind
A facade of vacational cabins, there’s darkly shadows
Somewhere deep in woods where I have them
Tall trees, and the leaves they love the breeze
It’s so peaceful and secluded with horror you can’t believe
The begger repeating "please", broken down upon your knees
Hands quiver, come now bleed out until it reds the streets

[Verse 5: Monoxide]
They wanna get up inside of my head, never
I don't care what the doctors said
In the woods with a bag full of smoke for cover
It just makes me feel better, just keeping it real when I
Tell you not to go in the woods
Cause I’m back there and I will sever
Head from neck, put em in a hole
And I call the show cause it’s dug fresh
Anything left, dig another hole
And burn that shit like I’m learnin' it
Crime scene tight like a tourniquet
In the woods I’m on my murder shit
Love to watch the blood squirt a bit
Just cover it up with the dirt like this[Verse 1]
Here in the underground, so many lost and found
So many trading in styles in search of new sounds
So many swapping emotions and seeking new ground
That they forget to stop it and take good look around
What did they leave behind? What did they lose or trade?
No matter where they go, no where will be totally safe
You left your gat and ID inside the suitcase
Then skip town to go out put on a new face
So now you're

[Hook]
Lost and found in the underground
And if you threw it away somebody else is gonna find it
(Lost and found) Somebody else is gonna find it

[Verse 2]
Here in the lost and found, he find a way out
At least he thought he did threw that suitcase out
Into the river leave and lost for nobody to find
As this identity was erased from that space and time
He made it all the way to Tennessee
Before he started seeing coverage on a truck stop tv
Seven bodies were discovered, he only killed three
Sounds like a copy cat killer replicating me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Here in the lost and found, they felt that he was skiddish
And gave upon his work way before he was finished
So they found a murder weapon and pretend to be him
Wearing gloves so the gun still has his fingerprints
Now he's back up on retirement for one last kill
Then he's back to California to disappear within the hills
That was the first plan, a new place to call home
But the copycat killer couldn't leave well enough alone

[Hook]What up y'all?
This Jed Thumpman
Let me tell y'all a little story
About a muthafucka that I know named Blaze
Now everytime we roll up a joint
Muthafuckas always be talkin' about Blaze Blaze Blaze
Man fuck Blaze
This muthafucka act like he puttin' it down for the hood
Talkin' bout everybody know Blaze, big baller
I don't give a fuck
Dead muthafucka don't get no special treatment from me
Look at Sarie's son little Eric
You know that muthafucka down to wear a wheelchair
I hate that muthafucka
And I don't show him no special treatment
So Blaze can kiss my ass

I put in work for my hood
So fuck a 9 to 5
You can find me on the corner
Hustlin' on the grind
They call me Mr. Lump Lump
So when their heads hear the thunder and the bump bump
They come out runnin' like the kids to the ice cream man
Children I'm sorry it's Blaze in the loony van
Playin' Atari, and I gotta do a crime to loot and 8 ball
Semi automatic with a clip for the law
All I wanna do is make money and smoke
Fuck hella bitches, and slang my dope
The law ain't good for a muthafuckin thang
But eatin' mad donuts, and gettin' all in the way
I been gone for more than a day, and some things changed
Some many died and some faded away
I represent the ghetto from Harlem to Pinewood
I ride for the hood, I put it down for the hood

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

I've been dead to the world for the last 11 years
My body's decomposing, I'm missin' part of my ear
Still gonna rock till the day I die again
Get up back from the dead, and ryde again
Walk again, talk thug shit, right
Empty mack clips, right
Keep it old school, wanna see that bitch? Uh huh
When it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps
Killers, jerry curls, and baseball bats
Ready to die like everyday
I put it down like a muthafucka, everyday
I drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday
And we all trying to get paid but anyway
Killas don't talk, but this one do
Talk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you
Twice in the chest, once in the face
Plus the extra heater on the safe side in case
Your bitch is wack well she can catch one too
Cause if you're down with your hood
Then your hood down with you

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

Psychopathic just like thugs
We ball, and we fight
And just like the freaks I come out every night
Holdin' down the sidewalk
Standin' amongst muthafuckas that's soon to be outlined in chalk
Sippin' on a cold ass 40 of OE
Live from the DET we OG
Pissy drunk always, we dead bumpin'
Stay thug with the throw away in the trunk
Bitch slapper, fuck a bitch rapper
Bitches were made for fuckin' but that's another chapter
Bitch you don't know me, don't approach me
Thinkin' that you're down with Blaze ya dead homie
G Blood imbedded in street blocks
That's why I put it down, and blast with many shots
Bullet holes in my chest, it's all good
Man I even died for my hood, muthafucka

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I... h-h-hate... everyone
I hate everyone
I... h-h-h-hate... h-hate... everyone
I hate everyone
I, I-I, I-I... h-h-h-hate. Hate

[Monoxide]
Ya hear that?

[Jamie Madrox]
I hate everyone

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
We off the train tracks homeboy, we outta control
Me and Madrox rockin' bitch, slappin' the world
[I say some shit to make ya toes curl quick, little bitch]
Paint a picture like Picasso from your blood when it drip
Take a sip, it makes me stronger than the strongest man
And my mind takes a journey to the farthest land
I'm the whole world's kryptonite,
I got these bitches on they knees
Kissin' hands, cryin', beggin' for they life
I'm a butcher knife to the neck, gotta go, what
One, you just a ho, right, two, you ain't a Juggalo, believe that
Broads you watch your mouth and represent, you get your head split
Quick, some shit they can't stitch
I'm a scrub for life, don't let the hairstyle throw it
With a bag of weed, looking to blow it
Those who don't know it, I'm Monoxide, blaze up a smoke
And pass that shit to your boy and give his bitch a choke, biatch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
For those of you that don't know, it's Mr. Madrox, yeah
First name Jamie, can't nobody see me
And my brother M-O-N-O on the M-I-C and basically
My little brother Blaze put it down with thug mentality, that's right
We represent the vicinity of the East, eastside
Bustin' free, no love for hoes or the police, biatch
What you thought it was?
Bumpin' weak shit, need to get some Hatchet in your life cause
[Perpatratin' like we don't know]
Yesterday you was a hater but today you's a Juggalo, bitch
You just a wolf wearin' sheep nanny coats
Tryin' to fall up in the flock with the same hokey-doke
I turn you into smoke, breathe it in, second hand
Soundscan underground, just lost a hundred grand
So fuck a fan base, yeah, show me family faces, yeah
No matter they size, shape, or races

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaze]
First off, here we go, whoever trippin' get the sawed off
Point it to the back of your head, actin' like the dead
Don't play, twelve shells a day
Still put it down for my G's around the way, HEY.. HEY
Ain't nobody tryin' to step to
Better watch your mouth homeboy I'll powerplex you
Into the mat, now picture that
Your style so skinny, your nose is hella hella fat, fat
Fat enough to kick it
With a gang of hood rats in the back of a chicken shack
We react to your jaw like a side effect
And fuck you hood rat hoes in the projects
Got a twelve gauge and I'm holdin' it down
Who wanna ride with me cause I'm headed eastward bound
For the T-W-I-Z, T-I-D
B-L-A-Z-E and we ride till infinity, yeah

[Hook]

[Bridge: Blaze & Madrox]
For those of you that don't know
Never blow hydro
Are you afraid to go where I go?
Even though
Call yourself a Juggalo
Tellin' everybody that you're down
X2

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Hook]Stay out!

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
You couldn’t see the clearing from the road
So, alone I sit, my legs folded and eyes closed
This is the place that I go
To come to grips that my sanity’s juxtaposed
With insanity, overload
And I’m afraid, a vessel
When I’m back here, I’m all alone
There ain’t no screaming for help
When you're gone, they’ll never know

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
All the way to the drowning
Heavy stick in my hand and my heart, it keeps pounding
I'm holding them under
And their faces turn blue and I'm watching for wonder
See I hunt them like wild lions
And I catch em and kill em and cut em with hunting knife
Taxidermy like Mormons
Stuff their body with leaves and replace vital organs
The thing that's important
Is to never dispose of the edible organs
Delicious and morbid like a bucket of blood and a handful of organs
A place in the woods, where no one
Will hear you dying or seeing you live again
Rest here, you're home now, I'll keep you here with all of them

[Hook]
Sometimes when you look in the woods, the woods... Look back
"I don't like to be-" there's no one in the…
I am the woods
Do you believe in the devil?
I- I shouldn't of gone in there
Stop going there, -do you go in there for?
"Hey, stay out of the woods!"

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Off in the shadows on darkest of nights
There stands the heartless, his targets in sight
Underbrush overgrown, death stays hidden
Moss growth camouflage, body parts missin'
Trophy collection connected to the prize
Like to hear em scream, always look em in the eyes
Wear my disguise, it's the face of a victim
Get excited everytime my knife sticks 'em
Watch em die in a place in the woods, the sensation feel so good
Drag em to the cabin, singing and laughing
Addicted to the feelin', so appealin' is the killin'

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
I'm taking them antlers, night is black as a panther
Lost in the rapture as I torture the victim I've captured
No hearin' the screams of me stabbin' behind
A facade of vacational cabins, there’s darkly shadows
Somewhere deep in woods where I have them
Tall trees, and the leaves they love the breeze
It’s so peaceful and secluded with horror you can’t believe
The begger repeating "please", broken down upon your knees
Hands quiver, come now bleed out until it reds the streets

[Verse 5: Monoxide]
They wanna get up inside of my head, never
I don't care what the doctors said
In the woods with a bag full of smoke for cover
It just makes me feel better, just keeping it real when I
Tell you not to go in the woods
Cause I’m back there and I will sever
Head from neck, put em in a hole
And I call the show cause it’s dug fresh
Anything left, dig another hole
And burn that shit like I’m learnin' it
Crime scene tight like a tourniquet
In the woods I’m on my murder shit
Love to watch the blood squirt a bit
Just cover it up with the dirt like this[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
D town with it, turn to the back
With that east side repping ready for the attack
Checking the attire, its all white and black
With the black Twiztid embroidered up on the back
Guess who's back, yep, it's the tray side
And we put it down for life and ready to ride
Madrox and Monoxide, you ain't heard
Got people in withdrawal anticipating our return
With everywhere you look, it ain't looking good not at all
And everybody looking is waiting for you to fall
Now we desire to dominate that's man's natural instinct
And put it on the line like reputations and pink slips
We got the music, let it do what it do
And this stress weighin' the world, we gonna carry that too
And we gonna bury them fools and the rest in a cloak
At night and gonna strike like vengeance upon parasites

[Hook x2]
Now don't y'all, not for one second
Think I won't just BUSS YO' HEAD OPEN
Give me a reason to leave you breathing
That's a point blank message to all the non-believers

[Verse 2: Monoxide Child]
O six Caddy, brand new daddy
Twenty eight grams in twenty little baggies
Got a little something in the back of my khakis
Cause I'm always getting threats that they wanting to kidnap me
Flames still burning and the hatred's back
I got the chainsaw revving and bloodstains to match
I got you nervous like a reverend who got caught in the act
And you react like you did when he got whacked with the ax
Underestimated and medicated
I'm only hated and segregated from the people who never made it
I'll be dead if I bowed out now Jack
I represent a portion of people who on the real they won't allow that
They got us tatted on their neck, breast, chest and head
And undress the dead, enough said
We got a mark on your planet earth
You got a rack full of bootlegged shirts, the truth hurts

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
You've awoke a sleeping giant, all this like a lion
Your sawed off blasts leave all your mama's crying
At the wake, ready to bake everybody in the front row
My aim is to put your relatives in a hole
Laying next to you stretched out in one big plot
With blood clots all over your head like polka dots
No gun shots, did it all with my Louisville slugger
Another notch added every time I beat a mother fucker
STOMP A MOTHA FUCKA! Drag they bodies in they back yard
Chop heads and hands off of the corpse
The identity, I ain't trying to see no time
It's on, I scatter ashes where the sun don't shine
And I do dirt with only close peoples of mine
Cause they real while you phony snitches out there dropping dimes
So give me one reason to get me to squeezing on another
And I'm a haul out and start cracking mother fuckers

[Hook x4][Verse 1: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
You know I smoke weed, it burns, I exhale
I'm high right now, who the fuck you gon' tell?
You can probably smell aromas comin' on strong
Like the stench of the water in the bottom of my bong
Ain't no peace for 'get along', no I'm not a flower child
.45 up in my waist, you poppin' off, we gettin' (wild!)
Give me room in the zoom that I'm gone off the keyshia cole
Eyes closed, holding back the choke cause my lungs is full
Pass the shit, get it back again for another bowl
Smoking like a chimney cause there ain't no carbonation ho
Nothing in the room but clouds far as I can see
You wanna get high with me?

[Hook: Dominic]
A couple pounds burning up
I owe that loud
Mixed with that swerve in my cup
So high I can't come down
And I'm shit-faced, yes I'm wasted
I'm shit-faced

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
How many times can I chime rhymes with a fried mind?
Is what you're thinking with every line that you rewind of mine
Let me remind that in order to walk the border of evil
I'm burning quarters at the speed that a racecar drive
I get abnormally high but inside
I'm transforming like I was Optimus Prime
But the form that I reside is a crime lord
With an eye four times the size of any kinda cyborg y'all can find
Feel like I wanna go play on the dark side
So I got my little bag of that cloud nine
And I'll start by taking a short drive to the cemetery
And then I'mma park, right, get a flashlight in a grave site
And then I'll be ready to spark mine with a great time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Yo Blaze, Monoxide
Y'all motherfuckers held it down for the weed heads, but what about the alcoholics?
Let's go!

Roamin' with the airlines as I'm floatin', drinkin' Cognac
Big glass, no ice, to the rim, I’m in, pushing my wig back
It’s time to sit back, 4 hours till last call
I got a pocket full of hundreds, I'm thirsty, I came to ball (Bouncin'!)
Do I tip or double pour double ounces?
Bottle here, bottle there, I swear I'll share
That's really where it counts
There's a party where I'm sittin'
I'm soaking up all the liquid
Alcohol, yeah I'm addicted
My advice train is shiftin'
I went from doobies to blunts, a bowl to a bong
Now they're toking it, they did even ripped it up in our songs
It's impossible to be hard, sippin' cocktails, two straws
But I’m granted, don’t understand it
Managed to pulled it off for alcohol

[Bridge: Dominic]
We got the sticky in the back
Hennessy on my lap, I'm sippin' out the snifter

[Hook][Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm not a clone, I'm a Frankenstien
Created through the visions of a mastermind
This face, this soul, this rhyme is mine
But y'all don't know this... (Frankenstien)

[Madrox]
So what if I use jumper cables to kick start this retardedest brother
In this music game of street smarts?
Bitch, we been doing this since '93
10 years in this so called, industry
What I see is so many stars sucking dick
What we be is something that's truly flipping the script
What y'all know is only what they provide you with
A song is a song even if you call it a hit
My face is my property, painted of the night, wearing a mask
Whatever I have or have not.. become is an extension of who I be
Ain't nobody writting raps for me
And basically, putting in mad work
For the little that we obtained
Ain't no plaques covering the wall with my name
But my ever-growing family is spreading in mass
Enough to scare the shit out of your playa hating ass
And you still wanna call me a clone?

[Hook]

[Monoxide]
You couldn't play this kind of widespread
I'm sheddin' skins like chameleons
Just to keep up my disguises
(Now I'm hearing that this is the only reason that the people play me
But they really hate me when my make-up's off)
You sound soft, goo
And I'm gonna put in the words of the bia
And maybe you'll realize
This ain't a game, and I ain't a clone
It ain't the fame, it's the microphone
And all the family I've obtained over the years
Who representin' for the same peers you keep hating and disrespectin'
(Violent J put us up on the ground and said you gotta
Keep the axe on your waist at all times
It's a whole lot of people that's just looking to shine)
So just don't worry about the haters just bring it from what's inside
So this soul, this song, this rhyme
It's the soul of your very own Frankenstien

[Hook]

[Blaze]
If they're both clones, what the fuck am I?
A painted dead body, soaked in clothes from formaldehyde
Notice where your eyes straight knock out teeth
And bring the heat to your dome, leaving some smoke in the street
Knocking the beat, knocking the flow, knocking your door off the hinges
Fuck you bitches and all you haters layin on the floor, fuck what you know
I'm playing baseball with hater's dome and telephone poles, because I'm out cold
Told me your dying, Blaze Ya Dead you know the rest
And it's a motherfuckin' shame to catch a bullet in ya chest
For some shit you said when you was high and thuggin'
Now the gats in your face and look who ain't saying nothin'
Your a fake yourself, and fuck your wealth
And fucking with a Frankenstien is bad for your health
And you can put it on my casket and my fan bases
This 40, these nuts, and our painted faces

[Hook]Skit:
What do you mean you're not gonna do it?
I.. I just... I can't do it!
No, I'm tellin' you I went through all this shit to get this motherfucker here you're do... You're doin' it!
I can't do it- he's looking at me and I can't he- turn him around the other way!
What difference does that make, you gonna stab his ass?
Look, stab this motherfucker!
You grab one arm, Blaze grab the other one
Turn him around I can't- He's lookin' at me!
I don’t care, it dosen’t matter he can't see you there's a blindfold on him!
Alright wait a minute...
You son of a... I can't do it!
What are you doing?!
I can't do it!
I swear to God, stab this motherfucker!
You stab him!
Take the knife!
Gim- Gimmie the fuckin' knife I don't give a- Gimmie the fuckin' knife!
Look, co- You ready to di- Yeah bi- Here we- I can't fuckin' do it!
Gimmie the fuckin' knife I'm gonna do it!
No, I'm gonna do it, I'll do it
I said I was gonna do it, I'm gonna do it!
Here, take the knife!
*Stabbing*
Oh my God!
Oh my God, I stabbed you!
Are you fuckin' serious?!
I'm sorry!
Oh my God!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
You just stabbed me!
You just fuckin' stabbed him?
I’m sorry.... I'm nervous
Dude, that's a lot of blood!
"Please, let me go!"[Verse 1: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
The sun goes down, and I crept out the cemetery
Lookin' for hood rat hoes, like this bitch Mary
Known to fuck, known to suck
Every nigga that I know done been in the guts
But when it came to me, she wanted to front
Said my gear was dirty and smelled of dead funk
She probably woulda kept talkin', if I let her
But I slapped her in the mouth and put my dick in for pleasure
Then she started actin' erotic, and got excited
Story done changed and in the pussy I'm invited
She wanted me to tag the pussy, wax the pussy
Go down south, hold up bitch, get the fuck out!
(You ain't famous, bitch!) And if so, I don't give a fuck
I stay real with dirty hoes and love to get my dick a suck
Don't get it flipped ho, you's a hood rat
Only good for fuckin' and suckin' cause it's like that

[Hook]
Bitch, you's a hood rat (I'M JUST TRYIN' TO FUCK!)
Do it like a rat (FACE DOWN, ASS UP!)
Chicken head, dirty ass, no good trick
Hood rat bitch, you can (SUCK THIS DICK!)

[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
Old school rhymes bring back teenage memories
Like when I was datin' Betty and fuckin' Denise
Or drinkin' Sisco in the park with some hoes after dark
Play hide and go get it like a sport
But things change, fuck Sisco, fuck the park
We want more from the bitches wit a brand new car
Semen swallowers, orgasm hollowers
Hit it from the back chronic sack, smokin' girls with mad dollars

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Now it's a whole new day, different story
Ran into a bitch named Tracy and her cousin Tori
They was walkin' and they needed a ride
Pulled up to the curb and they both got inside
Cracked open the 4-0, then I took a sip
Now which one of y'all bitches suckin' my dick?
Then they knew the time, cause they down for the benefit
Hood rat hoes, pussy always warm and wet

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Anybody Killa]
Every day in the neighborhood, it's a hood rat fest
Joggin' pants and house shoes with they hair a mess
Hoochie mamas causin' drama like a 9 to 5
(You's my baby daddy, J!) Bitch, that kid ain't mine!
I was strollin' to the liquor sto', one day
Smokin' on a big fuckin', fat J
Seen a chicken head comin', my way
It was a toss up, had this killa straight up amazed
It was a good day, never had to take the 9 off safety
Every feind that I seen was glad to pay me
5-0 ridin' by wavin' high
Without the bright lights from the ghetto bird in the sky
Today's the first time I ever seen the hood could look fine
Get this, weedman sellin' twenties for dimes
Oooh! perfect future in my dead crazy past
Dirty gangsta money gets you dirty gangsta ass!

[Hook x2][Intro: Violent J]
Hound dog ass muthafucka…
Raise up off my nizzos
Get off my nuts!
Get off me bitch!

[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Shit, muthafuckin hound dogs, what?
Swingin from my balls so hard, it's like I got a third nut
And look, I don’t care who you know, bitch
Lookin fine, get the fuck to the back of the line
Lyin to hoes, sayin you my cousin
Like my momma and your momma are sisters or somethin
Oh yeah, we down, go ahead, let 'em in
Blah! Knuckle hammers to the chin
Be down with me and I’ll be down back
Put my dick in your mouth? You’re gonna hear your neck snap (CRACK!)
In fact ho, fuck out my bus!
Ask questions like a mutt but ain’t down to fuck? (no)
You see ‘em go, you see ‘em go, you see ‘em come again
From my dick to Twiztid's dick, and then
To Violent J's dick to Blaze's Dick, try to grope us with they paws
Goddamn hound dogs!

[Hook x2]
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Hound dogs ain't got shit to say
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Give a dog a bone, give a dog a bone

[Verse 2: Monoxide Child]
What's the whole meanin of a hound dog? (What?)
Butt sniffin, dick lickin, all kinda rub y’all
I’m in a club, smokin on a square
Step on out to get a little fresh air
But I can't do that, I get attacked like a cardiac
People rushin front to back, they’re like "Sign that"
Ain't nothin wrong with givin me props
But actin like the punk ass cops
And swingin off my nuts has gotta stop
Walk around, spreadin rumors like you know
Sayin shit you heard me tell a ho, after a show
Homie, I don’t play that shit one bit
Fuck around and get your head cut off rite quick
Psychopathic bitch boy, peep the axe
Specializing in splittin the hound dog backs
Plottin against the whole world in facts
So get off my dick, and I’m out like that!

[Interlude 1]
[Jamie Madrox]
Alright y’all

[Random hound dog]
Wait, come here!
Oh my God, you don’t remember me?

[Jamie Madrox]
Nah...

[Random hound dog]
I had a crush on you for like, nine years…

[Jamie Madrox]
I don’t know you fat bitch!

[Random hound dog]
It's me, Jenny!
I sat behind you in Ms. Croberry's chemistry class

[Jamie Madrox]
Bitch I ain’t even go to school!

[Random hound dog]
No, I’m saying if you were to sit there
It would have been the shit
Umm, you think you could sign my shirt?

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Yeah, I remember school
Hoes back then was like "Joe Bruce? Ewwww!"
Years pass by, and look I’m a star
Now all them hoes like "Joe Bruce? Ahhhh"
I’m still that nerdy ass voodoo nut
Now I got hound dogs sniffin my butt
I could have a worm hangin out of my dick hole
And they’d be like "Well I think it's cute though"
Miss me with all that, I ain't changed any
Look at me, I make Big Pun look skinny
I’m ugly as fuck, resembling a Klingon
Hoes still let me get my ding-a-ling-a-swing on
What up with these pop kids buyin my shit?
Mainstream groupies, get off my dick!
I wanna see real Juggalos at shows
Fuck these Backstreet richy fake hoes!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Y'all don’t even know who the fuck I am
Yet bitches like "Who’s his friend?" Goddamn!
My lips is crusty, my feets is musty
Lift up my nuts and my inch is dusty
I ain't had pussy in eleven years
I been dead, ain't nobody sheddin tears
Look bitch, I don’t give a fuck about fame
Glock cocked for you bitches, cause I’m married to the game
Ain't no shame to the shit I speak
Slap hound dog bitches in they face for weeks, freak
I see you hatin on my Raiders cap
When back in the day you was all about that (Sure was)
Shot that ass out back in ‘89
Buried wearin Locs and this clock of mine
Rose from the dead with the Lotus clique
My guns played out, and I ain't changing shit! (nope)

[Interlude 2]
[Random hound dog]
Hey, aren't you Monoxide Child?

[Monoxide Child]
That's right bitch

[Random hound dog]
Right....the skinny one
My best friend John supposed to be cousins with you or something

[Monoxide Child]
Who?

[Random hound dog]
So like, I figured if you give me your phone number
I can give it to him, and maybe we can all hang out or something

(Monoxide Child]
Shiiiit

[Random hound dog]
Whatever
Oh my God it's Blaze!
HEY DEAD HOMIE!

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
You’s a hound dog bitch, and I will smack your face
Ridin on my dick, now how my nuts taste?
Every place that I go somebody want a photograph
Or an autograph or “Can I get a dap?”
“How did y’all get started, y’all shit is really tight”
“And what be motivatin y’all to grab a pen and write?”
Listen hear lil bitch, I’m the killer in disguise
Twiztid muthafucka with the milk white eyes
I despise how you try to perpetrate like a Juggalo
But you ain't down, muthafucka, you’s a Jugga-ho
Hey ho you’re afraid of the facts
Never packin a gat, and always seen with an axe
Take another picture and I’ll break your jaw
I got an eighty pound punch for each and every one of y’all
Muthafuckas with the bitch ass hound dog face
My ass crack's exposed, go on ‘head and get a taste

[Hook x2]

[Verse 6: Violent J]
Muthafuckin hound dogs muthafucka
I got more shit to say
It be the same hound dogs in different cities
Starin at me like I’m a set of titties
Autographin T-shirts, hats, and socks
And this bitch don’t even know Riddle Box
Real Juggalos don’t want no picture
They just walk up like "What up Ninja!?"
After that, they give a fuck where I’m headin
They're like “Fuck him, we’re lookin for neden”
And I don’t need any more free tattoos
Got my arms looking like Motley Crue's
I can be talking to the finest bitch in the land
And you run up like "Hey, what up man?"
That's when I slap you right on the spot
And have Billy Bill beat you down in the parking lot
Do I think I’m better cuz neden comes easy?
Fo-sheezy, bitch!
Bottom line y’alls
Get off our balls
Psychopathic out like Biggie-Smalls

Can't fuck with Dark Lotus little Biiiiiitch![Verse 1 ]
Yo, guess who's back up on the scene?
It's the microphone fiend
We're something like a new tag-team
If I'm Rakim then Mike Clark's Eric B
Heartbeat's when the base line drops
Riding on the stair and I ain't gon' stop
Zombie King with a board in the head
B.L.A.Z.E. yeah, back from the dead

[Hook]
All of us were murdered away
Although the chosen king will return to say:
I'm back from the dead (Ya dead homie)
I'm back from the dead (Ya dead homie)
All of us have needed a king
So if you return, just grab your wings
I'm back from the dead (Ya dead homie)
I'm back from the dead (Ya dead homie)

[Verse 2]
I'm back from the dead, fuck what you said
I'll say it one more time so ain't nobody mislead
Fuck what you said, I'm out the coffin
Often the suckers that be talking is the ones I be jocking out
First minute of the ten round bout
Running off at the limit stuck the foot in your mouth
I'm reved out the dirt of the urb to return
To the top of the world, in the spot that I earned
This is my spot now, all ho's bow
To the O.G. been to the grave and out
Some folks shout, but I can't blame 'em
I'm like a gladiator, I was sent to entertain 'em
Saying all punks and chumps at my arrival
Blaze Ya Dead Homie is back, it's my revival
Back from the grave, crazy in the head
Blaze Ya Dead Homie and I'm back from the dead

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I busted out the casket, with a hatchet
I place in the shed, so later we can pass it
When I broke out shit done changed
The hood lost their nuts to pigs, shit strains

[Bridge]
I'm back and you offended
You thought my time has ended
Now that I am ascended
To hell which you're pretending...

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I'm back on the block, it was hot, but now it's cold
Because I'm out cold on these trife ass hoes
Take my six inch, a zombie, outta limit
My home is a twilight zone, and you ain't fucking with it

[Bridge]

[Verse 5]
I'm back to reclaim the throne I left vacant
Been gone a minute, but I need to put my steak in
Take back everything and all I ever had and more
Rose out the grave but now it's time for me to soar!

[Hook](Shaggy 2 Dope)
Kill me! Whut! Motha Facku! Murder Murder! Whut! I can't fuckin wait to die!
Please muder my motha fuckin ass off! Bring it! Cause I'm goin to Shangri-Leezy!

(Violent J){Shaggy 2 Dope}
Have you ever tried {to get the fuck up out your hole but}
Fall right back inside? {Once again denied}
Have you ever seen {people turn into the devil}
Over money green? {Tell me what it means}
Have you ever been {to the wicked part of town and}
Would you go again? {They don't want you in}
Would follow me {if i knew where it rains diamond?}
No more poverty {As clean as we can be}

(Chorus)
It rains diamonds nightly in my Shangri-La lit brightly
Who could miss this so inviting? Come stand mountain top and yell

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Someone stab my face or somthin! Kill me!
What the fuck a ninja gotta do around here to get his dead on?!

(Violent J){Shaggy 2 Dope}[Anybody Killa]
Do you like to drink? {Would you fuck a girl the day you met her?}
What you think? {On the kitchen sink}
[Don't you fire it up? {Does this mean you wasted life now?}
[You're completely fucked] I would differ some
Hold your hatchet high {cause we're gonna need 'em when there's}
Fire in the sky {Together we will die}
I can promise this {In my Shangri-La you'll have}
Eternal happiness {diamonds in the mist}

(Chorus)

(Jumpsteady)
Diamonds drift upon the mist of forgetfulness, bringin a peace untold
As I fade away to become what my eyes see
Seeing into the eternity of Shangri-La!

(Chorus)3x

Bitch Slappaz

(Violent J)
Six in the morning police at my door
Already gotta slap some more
Stuck my hand out through the mail shoot
Bitch slap sarge and his first recruit

Don't assume friendliness with fame

Pow formats straight the back

Yet everybody singin that Southwest Song

Sayin they smackin wit the ICP
[Just cause I am they wanna be like me

(All)
Talkin that shit you need to leave the place

Claimin our shit, that's our shit you trashed
Mothafucka, we about to smack your ass[Intro: Violent J]
Killas kick the anthem like this
Juggalos up in this bitch, up in this bitch
Killas kick the anthem like this
Juggalos up in this biiiitch, blaze

[Verse 1: Blaze]
G's up, ridin' from the cradle to the casket
And beyond, recognize thug shit
Poundin' out the trunk bitch
Runnin' wit' a mother fuckin' hatchet
You haters, you suck dick was a thug, became a G
B to the L to the A, Z, E, still dead
Still don't give a fuck (give a fuck)
Sportin' all black kahkis with the mother fuckin' cuffs up
Smokin' Hella trees, tryin' to make a couple G's
So a thug can get back on his feet
Mean muggin', steady thuggin'
And I'm tryin' to find the hoodrat's all about fuckin'
Still loked out
All my dawgs from the past, dead or smoked out
Still tryin' to come up on a lick for a phat ass ride
So I can drop the top, and parlay through the east side

[Hook: Monoxide]
Niggas kick the anthem like this
Juggalos up in this bitch, up in this bitch!
X4

[Verse 2: Blaze]
Bitches freeze, you ain't a thug or a G or a banga'
You's a studio gangsta
You ain't about shit, scared to pull the trigga'
That's what we call, a real bitch nigga' (bitch nigga')
Sneekin' through the hood, throwin' up a set
Hangin' out the window, yellin' idol threats
Check this out, I'm a check your chin
Close your mouth, 'fore I put the barrel in
Dumpin' clips in yo ass is what I'm all about
Straight G from the clique on a paper route
Still slappin' off fake bitches with the Louiville
Beat a nigga' to the pavement, another bitch killed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jaime Madrox
This is the battle for the planets
We bring the thunder, givin' half the advantage
Fuck a style and a status
Half of y'all hummin' off a half ass deal
And got the nerve to tell a mother fucker "keep it real"
We see through y'all fools, like cellophane on the square pack
You bite our shit, you can keep it, we don't want it back
We don't give a fuck, east side for life
And if you ain't got heart, don't expect to have your shit tight
There ain't no room for the ho-hearted
We give a fuck where you at, or who you wit', or how you got started
Fuck you and everybody in yo clique
If you don't run wit' a hatchet, or claim the Psychopathic
I ain't got time, to say no names
It's only 8 rhymes, no holla', we been in the game
Besides fuck it, no speakin your name
You're just a bitch in the game
And y'all niggas gone' always be the same

[Hook x8][Intro: DJ Clay]
Juggalos... come out and play

[Hook: All]
We kept hustlin
We kept grindin
X4

[Verse 1: Violent J] (1991)
The overwhelming workload that it takes
The shakin' off snakes
The pains and the aches
Wrong moves and mistakes
They disrupt, they corrupt and distract you from your mission
And all those who let go and spend their lives wishin and missin
I couldn't listen in school, I felt I had a different callin
But all everybody did was roll their eyes and start yawnin
But this is real life and only you is livin through your eyes
There are dreamers, those who want it
And us, who won't be denied
Its a struggle every day, success is far from fuckin free
Unless you plucked it from a tree, with J and ICP
Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J (Shaggy: "Refuse to Lose!")
Livin' proof do what you got and you can do what you choose

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope] (1991)
Hate to sit back on this track like a little bitch and remininsce
But instead I'll kick a little history all about the hatchet
By this time in the game, most motherfuckers, they done fell apart
In these years we still shinin and we now just gettin our start
Inner City Posse jumped on the scene and we was mad crewed up
In the end when shit got rough and tough, it was just the two of us
When you was in the club gettin ya grind and ya sip on
We was in the parkin lot, hittin up cars, gettin our flyers on
Did my first show when I was sixteen
It's still part of my scheme
J holdin out a drive-thru window at Burger King to support our dreams
It seemed like yesterday, the world wasn't ready for two clown freaks
But we kept grindin
Now who on whose dick, lil Bitch shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide Child] (1997)
I woke up in the morning with my head on backwords
Went from street livin to an underground master
Went from sellin baggies in alleys
To sellin bangers from here to Cali
And rollin with the Psychopathic family
I started up with Krazees, hooked up with Violent J
The rest is still bein written like a biography
Don't think you know my story, cause there's too much to tell
Just know that I've been underground and I've been doin well
Since the days of makin tapes in the basement
We came a long way, I'd like to see you do the same shit
Monoxide, and I'm Twiztid with a Z
Carnival representin' til I D-I-E

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox] (1997)
We met ICP way back, touring once or twice
They was real cool, Felt like we known 'em all our life
They said You ever wanna sign with them
We was like hell yeah we down the ground with friends
They put us up, this was way before the family era
When we toured for three years with a t-shirt
Gettin mixed response from the bleachers and show-goers
Prepared for rock-throwers and flame-throwers we stayed focused
In '98 we dropped our first LP
Psychopathic presentin' Twiztid Mostasteless, the CD
Go out and get it bitch, shit is cold as ice
So dope that we released it twice
And we still here

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Blaze Ya Dead Homie] (1999)
It started as a guest spot, Parlayed to a real spot
Worked behind the scenes before I really got a shot
In the studio, quick still needin to prove somethin
My skills got me the deal off the CD you know it's dope
But it was on now in '99, the first GOTJ
Ya Dead Homie Blaze and ABK rippin the stage
The first time I ever got to grind in the sunshine
Six minutes shorter the EP's full play time
Still confusin some, give love for One Less G
That's when we moved to the streets and people started hearin me
From Colton Grundy to Clockwork Grey my skills increased
Don't believe me? Pick up my next CD
Let's hear some dead scream

[Verse 6: Anybody Killa] (2001)
I keep it grindin like an old set of car brakes
Started off with a duel player and casette tapes
By '95 my life was frustrated so I developed my mentals and let the funk recreate it
And then I hit the stage with my homie Blaze, thuggin for life
City to city tours under the light
Straight outta Detroit grindin Warrior baby
I ain't never gonna stop, my heat's never on safety
This is Psychopathic bitch boy and we so sweet
What you know about the label runnin under the streets?
This be Anybody Killa homie, like me or not
Over a hundred thousand sold bitch with one bout to drop
For real

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Bonez Dubb] (2006)
Mothafuckas don't trip I'm one of the youngest homies on the (Otis: "block")
And keepin it grindin with a (Otis: "dot")
And on my way to the fuckin ( Otis: 'top")
Because we underneath the surface
Be prepared to get real hurt bitch
We came from the gutter and now
I'm fuckin your mother and workin it
I know I'm only 24 up in this ho but check it yo
I was smokin before some of y'all was even startin to grow
Some of y'all don't even know
So many shows by eighteen
And by my twenty-first I was on the national scene, see
Been given an oppurtunity to speak my words and yo
Be keepin it wicked and run with the hatchet
For sho so smoke your roll
My name is Bonez and this be O-T
We murderin fucks til the sun comes up
That's why they call us A.M.B

[Verse 8: Otis] (2006)
Hey homie I hope you listen to my rappin
Cause rappin is all I have it's all that every fuckin mattered
Your heart can get shattered your pockets can get fatter
Just grind like me and mine and you'll shine like my family
In the beginning my mission was to make it to the hatchet
Then I did it and started laughin I grinded and look what happened
My mind is not on this planet, cause y'all thought that we vanished
But God's Hand got my back
And the game still gets me fuckin mad
I start poppin off at the mouth when somethin bothers me
You mothafuckers better give it up for R.O.C
You mothafuckers better give it up for A.M.B
DJ Clay mixtapes, gettin paid and makin haters bleed

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Boondox] (2006)
All the blood and the tears I spent on most of the years
And all the time on the grind I conquered most of my fears
The knowin I would make it and was it worth the sacrifice
Skippin meals and skippin bills I hoped that it was worth the price
Of the love of my kids and would they hate me in the end
For all the time I didn't spend I knew I'd have to make amends
So kept the mike in one hand the other gripped on my Glock
Kept one eye on the prize the other fixed up on the clock
It was a hustle in my heart that let me know I wouldn't fail
Would I end up on the stage or would I end up in a cell
Then one Monday afternoon I got that call from Psychopathic
Put the pistol in the drawer and now I'm runnin with the hatchet
(All: "Woop Woop!")

[Hook]

[Verse 10: DJ Clay] (2007)
I was sixteen young and was never put on
But was put down strong when Rude Boy gave me a call
Sayin that the wicked clowns had a party called Big Ballas
And if I want to come spin and make a couple dollars
St. Andrew's Hall (Yeah!) Remember it all (Yeah!)
When I went into this game who knew I would last this long
Then when '06 came around you can Fuck the Fuck Off
It was me and Shaggy 2 Dope I was on my first tour
And little did I know it was the first of many more
Now I'm pushin out mixtapes for the Juggalos
And the love I get from them keeps me higher than some dro
That's why I'm standin here, arms crossed
Just to let you know how we

[Hook][Intro]
You got ?nine dollars? with yourself. You’ve got a world ahead of you whether you like it or not. You’ve got to choose things. You’ve got to get up and go, through all kinds of change. Whether you want to or not doesn’t matter

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
And I can feel it now
It's more obvious than ever there's a problem
And I better try to figure out
If I'm willing ta solve em
Or ignore em like a middle child
Seems like it's been awhile
Since I had an answer to one of life's riddles, I'm riddled out
And now I'm stuck in this mental house and these four walls
Are driving me crazy and I'm begging em all
To take a different route, somebody save me
All I see is madness on the daily
It's getting out of hand like droppin a baby
All the pills I keep slappin away when they try to medicate me
I'm a danger to my safety and my angers
Got me strapped in a jacket at most times and lately
I re-act to the fact that it's all here to change me
With a middle finger right to the face and stay the same me

[Hook: Blaze]
(Lift me up)
In life the pressure so heavy that I feel I fallen to the wayside
If only I can get away from everything
Spread my wings and then fly
(Lift me up)
I know I wasn't born on this earth to become a failure and die
If only I can get away from everything
Spread my wings and then fly
(Lift me up)

[Verse 2: Madrox]
Our life is unclear shed a heavenly tear
For father we still toughen it out down here
In the midst of mankind
Where money's so tight they cuttin' throats
For pennies nickels and dimes
Hard to walk a straight line
When the road curves like a snake
And most leaders are cowards, liars and fakes
Who shall I follow in fear I pose a question
Your response, stay strong son and pick a direction
I'm not sure if I possess the confidence to carry on
I'm only here for today and tomorrow we'll be gone
It's an example of scenarios
Use your time to leave a mark stronger
Than a miracle felt in a soul
To a believer, you don't have to say it twice
To a skeptic, I'm sure no proof will ever suffice
To a sinner, it was over before it ever began
To the lost and lonely, sometimes we only need a friend

[Hook: Blaze]

[Verse 3: Madrox]
You can't stop greatness
It has a way of shining through any gimmick or fake shit
My aspirations to make it
Don't make it easy for somebody
Trying to do it for real better believe me
Fly with me flap your wings slow
Feel the ground beneath your feet begin to go
Away from me I'm excited with energy
A vision of clarity rise above the storm for solidarity

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
And your popularity is a drop in the Bearing sea
And apparently your nothing but average
I'm a dangerous package
Drown you all in my daydream
I'm laughing like a jackal
As I spread my wings and elevate free
I know you hate me
But in the grand scheme deep in your heart you wanna thank me
Cause we're the same we
All looking for escape from pretty much the same things

[Hook: Blaze]

[Outro]
The spiritual world is where I live, I exist in places you’ve never even dreamed of. You talk about, you know, this little physical realm you live in… guilty in… is in sin. Wha- How’s your courts guilty? How many people do you think you’ve hung on the ventilators, in another words and forced medication on em. You see what I’m saying? You don’t have any idea what the hell’s going on. If you knew what the hell was going on in your own system then you’d say “Oh, now I see what’s created me…Here come the maggot, feedin' on my flesh! x8

Darkness, (black!) buried underground
3 slugs in my chest, never been found
I'm decomposin', my lungs collapse
My flesh is food for the maggots on my back!
Got my gat! They all said my bodies paralized
I can feel them crawling on my eyes!
And lookin' for the open wounds, the smell of death
Now they on the march, on my face to eat my flesh
Startin' on my chest where the first bullet enter
A hundred maggots in and start diggin' in the center!
Tearin' up my insides, til' they reached my rib
Then one of them hollered, "Back to the grill!"
They all followed one by one on my chest
And headed on back to my face to rest
The trip to my head was like a race
They all made it though, and that's why I got a maggot face!

Chorus
Yea I got a maggot face and I don't care
Yea I got a maggot face and I, don't, care! x4

I got maggots on my face, 3 quarters of my body
They runnin' through my veins like a, IVY!
Feedin' off the blood and flesh to take control
Of a lifeless corpse, dead man without a soul
Tryin' to maintain while they crawl through my bloodstream
I can feel'em movin' from my neck to my brain
To my eyelids, to the back of my spine
From my feet on up to my mother fuckin' mind!
They want to take control of my body and reak havoc
On them suckas out there tryin to rob my fuckin' casket
Or my goods like a 40 of formaldehyde
A 9 millimeter, good for pullin' drive-bys!
My 2 rags and a sawed of shotgun!
Any sucka get wit'in 2 feet, I pop'em!
And I peel your wig, before you bit the case
I wanna tell you bitches straight from the maggot face

Chorus

Here come the maggot, feedin' on my flesh! x8

Now your homie Blaze, got a maggot face
Got me creepin' out the casket, just to erase
Suckers on my block cause the maggots gotta eat
Scoped 3 fools with my semi-auto heat
Dragged their fuckin' bodies back into my casket
Choppin' limbs up, wit' a hatchet!
Fresh for the livin, ain't no better taste
Woke from the dead, made a mother fuckin' maggot face!

Chorus[Intro]
Yo Blaze you so nasty, you know you nasty
Man you so nasty, you know you nasty, yo Blaze you nasty

[Verse 1]
Scabs and bubble gum, peanut butter on ya toe nail
Flickin' boogers in ya ginger ale
Get's my chain, bust ya in the face
Then wipe my butt, so now it's kinda itchay!
Drink doosh bags like wine coolas!
And throw gang signs for all the old schoolas!
I stuck an AK in a hood rat booty
Cause I found out she was a groupie!
If I blow ass, you gonna know fast
All y'all gone' need a fuckin' gas mask
I'm the yellow shit underneith ya armpit
And when I talk, that's fine, cause I spit
I'm like clay, wet, smelly and gray
I wore the same clothes forever and a day
Now you can hate me and try to say I'm trashy
And if you go & ask somebody, they'll tell ya that I'm
Nasty, that I'm nasty!

[Hook]
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty, nasty, you nasty, nasty x2

[Verse 2]
I'll use Anybody Killa rubber, after him
I ain't payin' shit and time's costin'
Mo money, and not enough veel
Word to ya neden, I'm just tellin' the deal
I suck the pus out my own pimples
And spit it on yo ass and fill up the dimples
I'm the lint, in ya belly button
Fuzzy like Moe, ain't that somethin'?
I like to fuck chickens, then 'que'em
Barbeque sauce on my balls just for screwin'em
I go swimmin', in a port-a-potty
And have shit and piss, on my face and body
I like to party, with my pants off
When my dick gets hard, smack it and it goes soft
I'll suck the blood, out a Tampon
I'm nasty as the mother fuckin' ground that I stand on
*Anybody Killa*"Only if you standing in a pile of shit!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I stay funky like a doo chip, I wipe
Snot on your bed spread, lil' sister pussy lip
I got mice sleepin' in the holes in my back
I tried to evict'em, they said fuck that!
Dirt under fingernails, wounds don't heal
Skrimp on my double burger, value meal
Take home some hookers, with no teeth
But still got lips and loopy ass cheeks
I'm the melted ice cream covered in ants
Got dried blood and guts on my favorite black pants
This one freeky bitch, tried to piss on me
So I sit on her, so that she can see
That killas don't swing like that
So open the neden real wide, and I stuffed in a rat
Why you think all the hoodrats ask me
"Blaze why the fuck is you so damn nasty?"

[Outro: Violent J]
Shut the fuck up bitch[Intro: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Round everybody up - Twiztid, Blaze, The R.O.C
I got a letter from the goverment
The other day I opened it and read and said it was bitches
- Cold 187, Legz Diamond, Anybody Killa, Doe Dubbla and ICP
A letter to the FBI

[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Somebody call 911 they gangbangin at the mall
A kid 14 and his boys from Omaha
Oh lord, Oh my God hes on a skateboard
FBI guy up in the tree... snore
Spying on the juggalo clique for 8 months
Undercover, ain't got nuttin, straight punks
Waisting everybody goddamn time and money
Cause you're some old out dated cops tubs and sonnies
Shit-headed and nerdy, like it ain't even funny
And the bitch in your ass is like bees to honey
Calling juggalo a gangbanger? - Outrageous
Pulling ninjas over whipping out gages
And the judge slams down the hammers
To the big house now for you gangbanger
If we let this be, we'll be face to face
With one man as he dictates the human race
Speak outta line, they coming at a zoomin pace
Kick you when you down, boots, two to the face
We don't need that, so don't give in now
Fuck the FBI it's how I'm livin', BLOW!


[Verse 2: Violent J]
Mr. FBI, Mr. Officer
Tell me why you want me in the coffin sir
Is it because I wear my hatchet tat
Or cause me and my fellas got matching chat
Is it because we like to hang out and be scrubs
Must be thugs out here peddling drugs
Well let me tell ya, all that meddling does
Is make us wanna leave you embedded in slugs
Free speech motherfucker, check this out
I want some pussy, or I'mma shot a cop in the mouth
Bang, guts hang like a wicked video game
It's all the same it's entertainment and it ain't for the lame
They can't get us so they come for those who walk wit us
Punish you for representin, make you wanna forget us
That's what we get, cause we ain't corporate
Self made and doing well so they damn us to hell
And degrade us, that’s what made us, they say the world hate us
For 20 years I've been getting paid to bust
Call me an old man, I call me long dick paid
Young sweet baby Violent J never gets played


[Verse 3: The R.O.C.]
Tensions high in new america, goddamn what's all of this?
So I walk around with mouth full of shit, spittin' shit
In the face lady liberty pushing swiftly through these days
In a block 300 looking like I'm straight about to bat cave
Government they now investigate so uptain
To windows looking too close will get you sketched, no incidental
Residential neighborhoods on high alert for the insane clowns
Anybody killing you get twisted and bound
Then set a blaze and murdered dummy
The Colds 187 don't just doubles every second
Who's the weapon? I am the R.O.C.!
A house full of skinny jeans, I'm kept in debris
I'm a disease and a cure for you sick and healthy M.C.'s
No resurrection from the clique, we gonna stay up underground
Saluting, never letting cock suckers putting us youth truth
The booth is a star, I walk the heavens keep it locked
We gon' rob the solar system on the shit until you stop


[Hook: Legz Diamond]
You can hurt our name
You can't solve our game
Fuck you and your claim
We don't bang, we're family!

[Verse 4: Cold 187um]
I'll pull a Tec' on you quick, I would say "fuck a bitch"
I spit, gangsta shit, I've been federally indicted, uh
I'mma killa from the west, don't test
Blaow, 187, the psychopathic
I come through, shut shit down, no bitch up now
I specialize in moving big dope and lettin' off rounds
So fuck the FBI, you know why they took 41 months of my life
Uh, that's why I ride or do or die, hustle world wide
Kick your door in, get your guap and back to the west side
No witnesses, a bloody homicide
Cause believe me, when I step ain't nobody gon' be left alive
The type of gangsta that plays for keeps, up deep in the streets
I got them bowls and birds for dirt cheep
So catch me in a old school classic
Reppin' the juggalos and everybody down with the hatchet

[Verse 5: Anybody Killa]
F is for the fools, B for bringing bullshit
I is my reply so yes, I feel included
Times really ain't changed, fans they says deranged
Music is the devil, and the artist is to blame
Juggalo I role, underground I stroll
Family is forever so this family will grow
I’m the FBI, Full blooded Indian
Back ready to ride, native pride once again
It's official, I had to go buy a new pistol
Just in case I hear the pigs whistle
Pull me over for a fucking purpose
Not because you worthless
Feeling like a criminal because I'm spittin' verses
Doctors, lawyers, dads and moms
Representin Juggalo cause they know it's the bomb
You can't stop psychopathic, the hatchet we jump hurdles
Even if you brought Elvis from the dead is John Burroughs

[Verse 6: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Don't blame me, not buildin a Bradley, it’s sad to see
You runnin your mouth and harassing the family
Trying to burn down my tree, cuttin' off branches
Like timber if you had it your way we'd be a cinder
You're far from heroic, you can't beat the stoic look on my face
As it changed from disdain to hate
Why you're spittin' your pulpit, I want to see your pores spit
All over the place till we're covered in all it
Toxic, no cure or antibiotics
You think we are so sick, we know you're neurotic
A build of psychotics, that drink and smoke chronic
Bitch you talking all that jazz, that's so sided

[Hook: Legz Diamond]

[Verse 7: Doe Dubbla]
Watch me blast off, laughin my ass off
Callin us a gang? Y'all high off bath salts
We hot as asphalt, they watchin us on every level
What if they told that you can't listen to heavy metal
What if they told that you had listen to the devil?
Fuck what they tell you, we some rebels so they persecute
We don't confirm the policies, so they hurt the youth
Cause we free thinkin, smokin tree, drinkin
They wanna catch us sleepin we ain't even blinkin
Fuck the feds, all my life they some suckas
I really think they mad, cause their wives wanna fuck us
The government don't wanna see me on some psycho shit
It's worse than the freeway sniper mixed with Michael Vic
Now they all fucked, wanna catch us in the twist
J Edgar Hoover you can suck the motherfuckin dick
And we ain't stopping till you take us off the fucking list

[Verse 8: Jamie Madrox]
Now I've been hustlin' and gridin' since I was new to the game
Before the songs and the videos and the screamin' the name
Before the diamond crusted hatchetman is swung from the chain
And I was greater than business, and all the trick to the trade
Learn to live it like I spit it, it's a family affair
A million painted faces in the crowd with hands in the air
All here to love us from above, and the devil rightly beneath
But the evil stares and shit talking can never compete
They wanna take us out the game and even call it a gang
Checking for tattoos and car stickers studyin slang
Man it's amazing how ridiculous this shit has became
Hoping that pride will go away but ours is strong and insane
It's only greater if anything below get heavy
But the goal stay the same, put the worries in the levy
People tell us everyday that we're the reason they survive
The true incentive of deeper hope alive, we don't die!

[Verse 9: Monoxide]
I been on that - fuck the law, middle finger to em all
A bitch who a line stepper, or a criminal rhyme shredder
Put a gun to your jaw, and make the world better
But instead I just shoot for the cheddar
And I can make you pearl jam and in my waist the Eddie Vedder
Looking for more them a bad rapper, I'm forever
Like Birdman baby, I'm so cash money
And the feds wanna ruin all that, now that's funny
I'll put a 5 hole in the 5-0
And I'm liable to emulate the face of a killa for my survival
Flat line your vitals, and I'm dangerous, and labeled a psycho
That ain't even the reason, they wanna keep us from the mic tho
My freedom of speech is what I would die for
FBI's my life long rival, cross-hairs and in scope of my rifle

[Hook: Legz Diamond][Hook]
Hey, man put it down! "It's all right" x2
What the fuck you doing, man? Put the fucking knife down! 2x

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Like a dope head with a fucking blade in his hand
Like a lost soul that exhausted every option that he has
Like an avalanche snowball theory covers his mind
And the white turns to red overtime (overtime)
Yo how can I explain that I'm an addict with a vision
A knife at the exact point it's making it's incision
What's on your mind at the precise point of decision
And the outcome of using intuition, take a listen
To the blood flow, as the streets run red
From the cut throats turning the live folks to dead
And the suites get paid no matter if blood rain
Comes running down the section of their window pane
Promotional campaign, got to spread the word
And the blood now days the only thing that seems to work
In a gore gore world, I'ma turn the redrum up
And see how many bodies it takes for me to come up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Who the fuck was that demonous witch woman with that trickery
And why'd she grow sick of me, shit it could be
A game she plays, evil is as evil does
Leave me for dead in agony just cause
I'd way rather never have had then to have had
To never have had is only half bad
But the taste, togetherness and all that it's worth
And then return to loneliness is the deepest hurt
I realize all the shit was lies
Our ties, bonds, secrets, promises, goals, our whole lives
Shit canned all that we planned, our miles ran
Super condensed into a one night stand
Five years of my life and soul, sucked out
She had her hands on his balls and his...
Betrayal, betrayed, cut off and played on
For life, I ain't about to drop this knife!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Usually fuck with guns but today I got a blade
Cause it's the only way that I can make it past security
Been working at this place twenty years with no returns
Spend it without pay, my family ain't their concern
The boss got money to burn, and he shows me every day
Copping all the new shit and then flashing it in my face
I'm saying just the other day he had the rollie on the wrist
And now it's two minutes from knocking him out and taking that bitch!
He didn't think I was in the shit, I ain't no square
Get a PED in the pen and then stabbing another player
I have no care except for family and job
And the ladder is no longer that is a 4 to 1 slide
Sitting outside the office with a knife that shines
20 seconds left till I know he goes for lunchtime
Door opens, put it in his neck without regret
Go away for life, but my family gets the pension check

[Hook][Intro]
Hey Frank!
- Hey Roger
Hey, can I see you in my office for a minute?
- Yeah, sure... Hey Stew why the boss wants me for a minute?
He probably got the cash
Yeah have a seat (What's up boss?)
We're making some cutbacks
- I know you're not talking about me, I'm here 15 years, I got a seniority
Hey, you gotta let it go
- I got kids man!
It is what it is

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
He's depressed in the dumps
Victim of involving economy got bunked off the Assembly line
And he feels like a chump
Wonder how he's gonna bring turkey for the giving and presents for the receiving
This sucks, one day if Obama has to go without
Explaining to his children how Santa must've missed a route
I don't think so, he's much too proud
To admit defeat or even accept handouts
So he tells his wife that everything panned out
At the plant and christmas is on his plan
Tears of joy fill her eyes, but inside
He feels even worse for lying and he wants to die
He pretends to go to work everyday
But he's not going to work, he's just wasting away
In the front seat of a parking lot up the street
Where he punches his steering wheel repeatedly saying "Why me?"

[Hook x2]
Sometimes it gets real hard
When you got no money and you got no job
And you got no reason to be celebratin'
And it seems like you're in a hopeless situation
(I got the chrismtas blew)

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Got the headlights turned off, the radio, too
With the garage door closed so we get all the fumes
Windows down so the exhaust gets through
And all the windshield, man, fuck it, Christmas, too
This is my gift to the bitch that ruined it all
Fuck Monoxide, this is straight from Paul
I probably should have seen all the writing all on the wall
But it's beginning with the cell phones calls didn't deminish
Didn't have a job? So what? Your work buddy's
Just one of the many people you was putting above me
I was thinking that you love me but when really it was a laughable situation
So now I'm ugly in this with your face (I think?)
Case of point in a minute you'll be dead
And then an hour after that all of your family's comin' in
And then an hour after that it's on the evening news
That the Christmas Blues was the reason I killed you

[Hook x2]

[Interlude 2: Monoxide]
I don't give a fuck I've been working here for 7 years
And this motherfucker just fired me
Like I ain't nothing but a piece of shit
(Hey Paul, you gotta calm down!)
That's a fucking loyalty issue baby
I gotta go there and handle my bussines
(It looks like he's got a fucking gun!)
I got something for all of you motherfuckers
All you motherfuckers! What?! (Gunshot)

[Verse 3: Blaze]
Dial it all on bread she said momma gotta pay the bills
More mouths to feed in a house upon a hills
Husband now reserved in the army and was gone and
Two months ago at night when he was sleeping
He was a medic in the army and a doctor in the states
Light was the oyster with money to take a taste
Take a page out the book, live happily ever after
Til a phone call turned to see a man into disaster
Was a sergeant of the army on the ether end
Said he had a little level nice on her husband
Grace yourself, ma'am, take a seat
Your husband has died in service of the country
We will send his remains and his personal affects
To his last residence, I think that's your address
So she's out gambling to help her forget
That she hasn't told her kids that their father's dead yet

[Hook x2](Jamie Madrox talking)
Yo this is serious shit right here
Me and my boys, we don't fuck around
You know what I'm sayin'?
So if you diss me, my mutha fuckin' people, or the niggas I roll with
You know what?
Y'all done fucked up
Here go the shittalkin'

(Monoxide Child)
You's a bitch ass ho
What you really know about killas for real though?
Stainin' my freek show, gang of lunatics
We the rebels for the dead
Fuckin' with us you'll lose your mutha fuckin' head
And now ya talkin' to your bitch ass hoes even a little
Rather beat ya to shit, and pull the plug at the hospital
Callin' me this, callin' me that
Cause you's a bitch ass nigga from the jump I wanna slap
With the old school beat down, 10 on 1
I don't remember no fair fights where I'm from
Maniac and I'ma stand right where the bloodstain is at
Hopin' you come back, nigga fuck that
I'm the poster child of death
I'ma keep swingin' my axe till nuthin's left
I ain't havin' that so fuck you bitch
Tell your friends I'ma hater and I'm talkin' shit

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Man I don't give a fuck how many records you sell
Stories you tell, nigga check yourself
And fuck that bitch that you're with too
When the shit go down, where the fuck your crew?
Probably at home bumpin' someone else
When the shit went down they told you fuck yourself
Now you cryin' inside little thug still frontin'
Thinkin' to yourself why the fuck you say something
Too many niggas wanna beat me up
Steal my shit, slap my bitch
I'm like fuck this
Now you know what it's like
To deal with real killas that don't play, everyday
Knockin' suckas out the box, who wanna get some?
Seven video channels for my victims
I ain't havin' that fuck you bitch
Tell your friends I'ma hater and I'm talkin' shit

(Jamie Madrox)
We the things that go bump in the night
We ain't got no love for you, you need to get some shit right
Bitch who you think you're fuckin' with?
We keep this shit like a track meet, we be runnin' it
With the hatchet on the back
While other bitches suckin' sour tits for air time and similac
We say fuck that, matter of fact
You tainted our style bitch boy we want our shit back
Don't get your head cracked you ain't tough
And all them skills don't mean shit when you get fucked up
So fuck your set, and fuck your crew
And fuck every mutha fucka around that down with you
And you ain't puttin' nothin on the map
Except for all this bullshit commercialized mainstream rap
And I ain't havin' that fuck you bitch
Tell your friends I'ma hater and I'm talkin' shit

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Ho ass hoes, we stomp those hoes
How the fuck you gonna step to Dark Carnival juggalos?
Creators of the wicked, night breeders
No little bitch faggots with blonde ?
So anytime you see me in public
You get a Faygo in your ass, and a jaw full of dick
You can keep your muthafuckin' TRL
I stay with my army in the underground and stay real
And burn down your little TV set
String Carson up with razor wire wrapped around his neck
Cause that's how we do all day
Cross to the other side, bitch you couldn't pay me
We stay on the dark side of the carnival grounds
Twiztid, Blaze and two wicked clowns
Heads are finna get chopped off, and slit
Bout to take it way beyond talkin' shit

(Violent J)
Hatchet don't count, hatchet ain't included
Knowin' goddamn well we the champs undisputed
We don't need your radios and MTV
Sellin' million, sayin' what the fuck we please
? who's coat you ridin' on?
You gotta lick balls, and write him a song
You got his dick buried so far up your ass
It's hangin' out your mouth, but you like that
And 2pac tried to warn ya
And there you are receiving the dick in California
While you gettin' fucked on the West coast
I'm at home fuckin' Kim ?
Fuck all you faggot ass sell out hoes
And fuck anybody denying the juggalos
Come to the underground and get bit
Tell your boys I'ma hater and I'm talkin' helly shit![Verse 1: Madrox]
Cover my eyes with the cloak of night
Till the darkness and shadows consume everything in sight
Mute my voice from the screams of pain
In blood curdling terror till my words fade away
Bond my wrist with a spool of twine
Collect me and keep me safe and confined
Cover my head with a burlap sack
I can hear where Im going but never find my way back
Dig me a hole with the shovel of death
And kick me down deep and take my last breath
Dead or unconscious assuming I passed
Awaiting to separate from my spirit and cross paths
Leave me to decompose my body petrifies
My corpse becomes skeletal insects and flies
Feeding on me and eating my body
And they think Im still missing but the sick man got me

[Hook]
Hes got his eye on you
Sick man
He's in love with your death
Sick man
Your never safe cause hes out there
Sick man
Now your the victim in his game
There are no rules we don't play fair
Sick man

[Verse 2: Monoxide]

Im tied up
Dried blood covers my eyes
What have I got myself into tonight
Im alone in a room and Im feeling like i might
Just become somebody's victim the lights
Keep flickering off an on and Im trippin
I can't believe I got myself in this position
Somebody's coming I can hear them unlocking the dead bolt
It must be dawn and I all I can hear the threshold
Is knocking the floor and I can hear him getting closer
And im trying to ignore
The best hope is a joke
And I don't think that it is though
It's been about a week Ive been down here In limbo
And every time I speak I get stabbed with utensils
So I do my best to keep my motherfucking lips closed
All along I've been caught by a skitzo
It so out of the ordinary to live though

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Put the lotion on my skin do it when Im told
Been locked inside the hole so long my beards full grown
Mental pain and chains that restrain and maintain
Make it cause real change in the brain its insane
How I pray every day to be free and never be
I can see myself giving up in his reality
Will it ever end?
Will I see my family and friends?
God take me out the clutches the one they call the sick man
Others he has captured not to long after their dead
If they could comprehend that he is master
Keeps the head as trophies cooks the rest neck to toe
Feeds it to me every night nothing left but bones
He bathes in the blood of the dead when he is well fed
He has conversations with the voices in his head
I pray for my death hope its quick an painless
Only then would I be free as one of the nameless

[Hook]
