[Sample]
Every nigger is a star, ay, every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star, ay, every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star, ay
Who will deny that you and I and every nigger is a star?

[Intro: Josef Leimberg]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your way, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat ass, smokin'
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Pre-Hook: Thundercat] (x2)
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)

[Hook]

[Break: Dr. Dre]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want? You a house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché, then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the borrow in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[Bridge: George Clinton]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Pre-Hook] (x2)

[Outro] (x8)
Tax man comin'[Produced by Flying Lotus]

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
High philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this fear and then embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now, tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing song and I can unite the youth that I love
Youth that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the installation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this ain't physical for mankind
This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
Bitch, you're dead!

[Break: Thundercat]

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no[Verse 1]
Close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw, puzzles not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing concrete
Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hating on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no god, I don't think that I'm a human, though cause I'm so odd
People selling drugs cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, (Dylan)

[Bridge]
Somebody do something (Somebody do something)
Somebody move something (Somebody move something)
It ain't no party like aristocratic party
Said, ain't no party like aristocratic party

[Verse 2]
Sipping Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavouring
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it dangling
FlyLo's still tryna put me on to Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook
We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm dying for the movement, trying not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consuming the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish biting nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown, poo

[Outro]
Somebody do something (Somebody do something) And...
Somebody move something (Somebody move something) You right there...
Somebody move something (Somebody move something)FADE IN

DONALD is sitting against a tree and holding the lemons that DANIELLE picks and hands to him

DANIELLE
I've had the most strangely reoccurring dreams over the last week. And uh, it's like of my wedding, but nothing is going right. Everything's a disaster. My guests are all there, it's all of my real life friends. They all look gorgeous. They're all like fully done up in their gowns that they're probably going to wear to the wedding, my family is there. But suddenly I realize I should've been married by now, and I'm not married, I'm not in my wedding dress. I'm all alone, in this giant area where I see my guests being served their cocktail appetizers off of paper plates. Everyone seems to be having a great time, but they're eating off of paper plates. But I am wearing cargo pants. Army cargo pants

DONALD
Like Old Navy?

DANIELLE
Yeah, exactly. Like Old Navy cargo pants. I don't own Old Navy cargo pants. I'm not even sure where that came from in my head, but I'm wearing that with a T shirt and I'm supposed to be getting married. My hair's not done, my makeup's not done. And my mom comes in and asks me, "Why aren't you getting ready for your wedding?" And I'm like "Oh, I will be, I will be" but suddenly I'm smoking a cigarette, I even don't know why I'm smoking a cigarette, but in my mind I also that I'm three or four weeks pregnant. Horrible, right? So I tell my mom, "Mom, you don't know this, but I'm three or four weeks pregnant" and she says not "Put down the cigarette", she says, "Maybe you should get into your wedding dress". It's all very, very weird. I'm not sure what it means at all

DONALD
I think we have too many lemons

DANIELLE
One more?

DONALD
Yeah

DANIELLE
And these two

DONALD
Yeah, some of them. That'll be enough

DANIELLE

CUT TO:

A MONTAGE:

A group of people are dancing around speakers. Assumingly, music is playing, but the events of that scene are muted, and replaced by the dialogue of...

INT. MOVIE ROOM. - NIGHT

DONALD and FLYING LOTUS are exchanging verses they've written

FLYING LOTUS

Investing time on writing lies, slightly truth without a clue
I met my higher self, pissing off the roofs of drunken goofs
He said "keep the mic smelly like a rotten tooth"
And all your fears forgotten when the Cap is in the booth
I'm an angel in an agony of flame
Feathers growing at the mention of my name, reinvention of my shame
I'm a slave to the darkness of my innermost cave
And all these words I hold tighter than a glowstick at a rave, nigga
Dance around the camp fire, buttnaked, blowing trees
Could give a single fuck if somebody sees, I'm free
Red "V" bleed out a scarlet letter, kill a king
And I'll sitting ready for whatever weather the seasons sing
Picking up expensive habits, chasing after little rabbits
Hope they lead me to a place of magic
Sad at all the times I never thought I had it
Losing all these memories, and y'all doubt it matters...
Patterns

DONALD
Mouth to a Pellegrino, bottle color of envy
Who the fuck is Gambino, I hand a waitress a benji
To act like she never met me, I'm saying though
They want the game changed when your shit on the radio
Fruit was so hanging low, I didn't even bother
She tryna land Obama's, man she get it from her mama
I don't blame her, I tame her, give her something to visualize
On my couch watching DVR'd "American Dad"
Man those new Celine bags are so to die for
I'm in that Porsche on Prozac, them suicide doors
Watch her walk as the death becomes her
Cause Mrs. Tarantino kill bills, no wonder
My heaven is the present, so maybe this is it.
Pray to God every night to make me believe he exists
Drink a fifth of vodka, I don't need no sponsor,
Heard a preacher holler, make him hold these souls

And that's when like the hook...

FLYING LOTUS
Yeah that's tight. I like that

You know you got a little...

He points to DONALD's nose, and DONALD touches it to find blood dripping

DONALD
Oh shit

FLYING LOTUS
Yeah

DONALD gets up, and runs to the bathroom

FLYING LOTUS(CONT'D)
Wow

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

DONALD examines his nose in the mirror, surprised by the bleeding

He looks for the source of all the blood, and notices and obstruction in his nasal passage- it's a string

Nauseated and scared, he pulls the long, blood soaked string while gagging and coughing. Finally, he dislodges the string and what is attached at the end, a golden tooth

He places it next to the sink and washes his hands, as the sound of the running water transitions into a similar sound of the shower water as DONALD now sits in the shower

He is still, and his back is to us

CUT TO:

EXT. POOL AREA - NIGHT

DONALD and FAM are sitting next to a bonfire, eating s'mores and swapping childhood stories

FAM
I remember being seventeen, being scared as hell. Getting prank calls, like crazy stuff. Just like senior year in high school. Had a lot of girls, it's crazy. So, this one girl, she was super crazy, she would call my phone from a blocked number, and it was her. But then I started getting like the crazy death threats. Started as a joke, then they knew exactly what kind of car I was driving, where I liked to hang out. Then they started shooting in the area, so I couldn't sleep at home anymore. Went and got a gun from my friend. Started sleeping on the street for a week. The scariest thing about it all though, is having a gun knowing you might have to use it. scarier than than killing somebody is thinking about killing somebody. Sometimes you can't explain why things happen. Those seven days, man, just couldn't handle it. Just couldn't handle it. You just get to that point like why did I get here? Sometimes they just do

DONALD
When I was like five or six, we were living in Decatur, in the projects. In Commons Drop. It's nice now, but like we were living there and I remember my mom's friend. Like a friend of the family. This kid like... Something happened, I didn't understand it but he had to stay with us for a couple of day. I didn't really understand it. But we didn't have any space. So he had to sleep in my bed. I remember in the morning waking up and he was like "Let's rub butts". I was like "okay" like whatever I did it. And I didn't really get it. And then I turned, when we turned he kissed me

FAM
He kissed you?

DONALD
Yeah. Like you said, I don't know why it happened. I don't know why it happened

FAM
Did anybody like know about this?

DONALD
Nah, just him

FAM
That's wild

DONALD
It's crazy

FAM
Like I said, sometimes you just can't explain things

DONALD
I'm gonna go inside

FAM
Alright, I gonna stay out here, man

DONALD begins to walk inside as we...

CUT TO:

HALLWAY

DONALD is walking to his room, as the GIRL passes him in the opposite direction

He turns, quizzically

DONALD
Who are you?

She doesn't respond, or even look at him, and keeps walking. Donald continues walking to his room

CUT TO:

INT. DONALD'S ROOM. - NIGHT

He is flying face up, eyes closed. The phone rings and he opens his eyes

He leans over and picks up the phone

WOMAN (V.O.)
Hello, who's this?

DONALD immediately hangs up, looks down for a moment, and takes off his sweatshirt and shirt

He lies down and falls back asleep

FADE OUT[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
First off, I'm a start charging y'all per compliment
You give to me, see how much purse I can earn off of it
As far as bars, you heard wrong if you heard continent
It's incontinence, inconsequent turned sponsorin'
Rockin' a fur smock with some RC and
Go from rockin' a beat to just curb stomping it
Serve consonants hotter than hot combs (coals)
And surfing through brown (perm)anent germs that will jump off of it
Hot dogging with no condiments
Flow proper this show stopper be Bogarting it
Other niggas be going hard, and Early be going artisan
And lick fo' shot of the focus, more talkative
Too talkative, let the robbers in

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Off a couple Sake shots
Watching pot grow in short shorts and some soggy crocs
Shoddy lot of black faces trading body shots
For all of the belongings in your pocket, park it
Hardly not, gnarly tots, nollie pops
Use a bit, it got me; then she buzzin' like a walkie talk
Staying gold like the only watch that Lonny rocks
Grimey socks and you know you don't wanna play with papa swamp

[Verse 3: Captain Murphy]
So unorthodox
Chillin' with a shaman, eating ramen in a parking lot
I brought a bag of dreams with me, breathe the kundalini in
Exhale the meaning and the feeling of Elysium
Even the reason leavin' 'em lost, lyrical boss, harder than most
So kill me, martyrs at most my Holy ghost
Host a party in 'em, I brought my unruly souven-
Here on her blouse like a "Yours Truly" steel pin
Ether (Ha ha ha); they can't get past the deep voice
Conceived in a Rolls Royce, abortion life, pro choice
Goth hop, put a beanie on pitch bent like a leanin' song
Learn to fly and high at the first sign that I'm dreamin' on
The Force is strong with this one though
Over 9,000 midi-chlorians say so
Really show no mercy, all master, no Percy
Show these little bastards in the journeys of my troubled mind
Saddled by your blasphemy, look at what you found inside
Now you can't imagine me, running high the casualty and fucking die
This is why we had to bring the guns out
Rattled neighbors' windows every night until the sun's out
Two dudes, two odd crews with strange leaders
Kitty cats, a couple blunts, my new wang feeder[Produced by Flying Lotus]

[Verse 1]
I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local, I'm on that global
I often had dreams of being locked in my mamas Volvo
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot
I'm off Ciroc, I'm off a lot
They gave me 10 Days off
That's an awful lot
I was off campus, but the officer
Told the office, that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave
While rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me go on and rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught, picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups, why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch I ain't scared, I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends, the next coffin is theirs
Guess what bitch, I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops, to tweak so I can offer 'em years
Have me tweaking, like I'm all full of fear.... alright, I'm tweaking[Produced by Flying Lotus]

[Verse 1]
Don't come back
Cause I'd like to save you
Make me talk [?]
Cause I'd like to save you
The days of men are coming to an end
So come with me, if you want to live
You come from a time where they look the same
And think the same too
There's nowhere left to go, so I'd like to save you
They all want to be saved
My hands been bloody since the day I came
It's such a shame, you've seen my violent side
Don't make me go away
Cause I'd like to save you[Verse 1: Jazz]

Trip-hop,Psycho,psychedelic spitting LSD
These are just some or none of the words used in describing me
I got sick of class so the doctors start prescribing me
Bars and beats
To spit on instrumentals halfheartedly
Stop
That's too braggadocios
I just wanna be like Moses
Move water like osmosis
The picture was out of focus
To my astonishment
You get allot of money and women?
Wow what an accomplishment
But while you move weight
I was out here moving continents
Expand consciousness
I should smite you for your incompetence
Suspend services
When you fly you catch turbulence
"The healing component"
Fire it up and start serving
Sipping hydrogen
Two point oxygen
Spitting venom because i heard it had antioxidants
It a'int an accident the way i'm placing these adjectives
Mind your bee's wax before Nicki start trapping it

[Hook]

Because its 1998
Feeling brand new like it 1998
Because its 1998,1998,1998

Because its 1998
Born yesterday like its 1998
Cause its 1998,1998,1998

[Verse 2: Jazz]

Til' infinity and beyond
(infinity and beyond)
Benjamin be my bodyguard til' the haters begone
Flow clearly like water you see the beaches we on
You see the sequence of silently sowing seeds of alarm
Maybe you just don't get it
You'll probably say that you hate it
But whether you fake or faded im repeated inside your playlist
When i was like a year old
I was dreaming bout euros
Now im dreaming bout making it while my heads on the pillow
Im sleeping on you fools
Who invented the rules?
The boy got flow who you think filing the pools
The same one you took out consideration
The moment you pressed play you felt the precipitation
I broke the wind free no Oprah
My chakras ain't charmen i heard less is more that's why im full off a diet soda
Mini-apolis
Its still no accident
The way im shaking and baking and placing the adjectives

[Hook]


[Verse 3: Real Sweatpants]

Real, these predicates are prestigious
Hacking your Cerberus
Butt-head no beavus
I'd like to thank jesus
Ive been blessed since a fetus
Been walking on water before i knew where me feet is

[Verse 4 :Jazz]


Laker my paper i dare somebody to rip us
My feet firmly planted Donald sterling couldn't clip us
Spatula couldn't flip us
A bic couldn't flick us
Takes more then a couple silly rabbits to try and trick us
Its obviously a movement dreams clearly lucid
I have a piece of  mind but like marbles im bound to lose
They marvel at how im marvelous
Take the record and loop it
Lucky that im a lotus cause i just show it and prove it
This is for the soul that's stuck in a low vibration
Sonic are my intentions
So put this song on rotation
Capital all my capitalist
Third eye activist
Abstract my analysis
Emphasis on my adjectives

[Hook][Produced by Flying Lotus]

[Verse 1]
I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local, I'm on that global
I often had dreams of being locked in my mamas Volvo
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot
I'm off Ciroc, I'm off a lot
They gave me 10 Days off
That's an awful lot
I was off campus, but the officer
Told the office, that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave
While rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me go on and rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught, picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups, why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch I ain't scared, I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends, the next coffin is theirs
Guess what bitch, I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops, to tweak so I can offer 'em years
Have me tweaking, like I'm all full of fear.... alright, I'm tweakingSmoke 2 grams
Up in 1 dutch
Never really needed much
Always had a special touch so they feel me
Im nice under pressure
Killing beats is just a guilty pleasure
Dont even put in full effort
I easily get it done
Flow like water
Once its on
I just let it run
Only right since I'm a track star
Listen to the proof , every track hard
Tell the D.j spin it like a frisbee
Let me see if they can catch it
White noise
Black magic
I'm in cognito
While everything thats fake is right in front ya face
But they blind tho
Ain't even in my scope because they micro
I dim the lights and shift my eyes low
Sticky green celery scented weed help me surrender to serenity
A member of eternity
Is what I will attempt to be[Verse: Jayed Afooni]
Unacknowledged, disoriented, unappreciated
Filled with hatred, What the hell is motivation?

And really I'm just looking for an answer
Why does the mind play games on us?
And do I even wanna be a rapper?
'Cus life changes more than the mind does

I don't really think love's the answer
But I don't know, Shit, I'm fifteen

My family, My friends that I'v acquired
Over the years, And instead of doing homework
I write these lyrics down in my iPhone
I phone home when-ever I get lonely
Just hoping someone will be there
To pick it up

To pick it up
I'm throwing up emotion in a paper cup
Those are the only ones I use
YouTube me and tell all your friends 'cus
Lately I've been lackin' some inspiration

The whole nation will someday know my name
Jonathan, ---, Jayed Afooni whatever
Call me what you'd like
Even the sentimental loser

I picked it all up way too fast
I'm feeling like a "younging" living in my ashes

And I don't really care 'bout a girl
No offense, I'm just not in the mood
But I'm a teenager, so that is crazy!..
I guess I must be from the moon

I'm hoping soon enough I will be free
And dream of a place that is far from reality

Simplicity is really not that bad
Especially when you're complicated as shit



'Cus you won't ever hear me makin' noises
Less I'm spittin' on the mic, Right where the poise is

Guess I am poisoned
Hex or a curse, But what's next
Does it hurt, to be happy?
Tell me, my cells are collapsing
I'm anxious, for the next chapter

Can you save me?
Do you love me?
Do you know me?
Could you judge me?

Well then I must be
Above it all
Above it all
Above it

Can you save me?
Do you love me?
Do you know me?
Could you judge me?

Well then I must be
Above it all..

Above it all[Intro]

Flex the product, steal the accolades
Never abdicate, statistics say he gonna spend half his life in, and out of halfways
Wanna live forever when he past paid
Butcher a Paige
Modelin' black bart dumpin in the cavalcade

[Verse 1]

States physically placid, but he's mentally erratic
Spazzin' till he's asthmatic, carpals rheumatic
Occupants seats still unfastened
Flabbergasted or problematic
Literacy above average
Famished flow satin, soundin a tad bit outlandish
Granted, sleep till them assets damaged

Flex the product steal the accolades, never abdicate.

[Verse 2]
Too advanced for the illiterate
Sentences is lucrative, grammar tad bit ludicrous
Do us through the pollen sniffed
Them fatten purses hurt again
Furnishin syphilis
Syllabus transitionin' to insolence
Curriculum vigilance, equivalence of testaments.
Murky when he spit, nod the head of the reverend
Paper come with mummification
Said, i'll see Satan for my sinnin'. But, whose killed more niggas than religion
Trying to figure out where it all fits in
Surely stackin' up the temperament
Inhaling loads of stimulants, see the world more vivid
Thorns breaking through the seems of cement
Rippin' ligaments from instruments
Packaging flaccid hits, the leviathan is back again

Flex the product steal the accolades, never abdicate

[Outro]
Rest in peace my nigga Jay.Forever engraved in our hearts, we love you my nigga
Parkside, nextFlying Lotus

[Verse 1]
Reminiscent my mother sit in the kitchen
Back when water whippin was solely doing the dishes
After school with my father baseball was the only pitching
He taught me early commission was solely based on commitment
Spit it
Intricate even Freddie vouch for the wordplay
While I was ripping tracks off of hip hop early
Even without that blue check bet my skills verified
Was taught to fear no man though God I'm terrified
They say I'm next up I would I would tend to agree
To a, certain degree man who better than me
Niggas in my city switching style like they from the south
Married to the game while your daughters garter be all in mouth
She cook chorizo and egg then pass the culo
Rarely see her father she calling me papi chulo
Black american story thats reminiscent of Juno
Venus vs Mars and I ain't talking bout bruno
Nigga what!

[Hook]
Reporting live...from the 219

[Verse 2]
The revolution will be televised
Little black boy who Tom Cruise vanilla skies
See through real eyes that realize the real lies
Feel the window pane you get baked they steal pies
Back when me and Chi used to bang on my desktop
Bumping Thin Lizzy in cities where only crack rock
Paint a perfect picture I Walter Johnson the backdrop
Always been ahead no ties you better ask Scott
Raps Moses, spit dopeness on flying lotus
You dont hear the hunger as flying locusts send my condolences
Back of the bus flowing a dozen of all my roseses
Packing the fallen petals we pushed to prepare this potent with
Teaching them through my music like classes of Holland Opuses
Vocal my point is focal I wonder now where their focus is
How they solve all the violence in Chicago?
Close 50 schools and worry bout it tomorrow
Nigga what!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Name any track that I ain't poop on
Like any verse I read I ain't nupe on
Like step, step, roof!
Look up and the roof gone
While y'all saving bitches like the kitty was coupons
Told you I'm on fire while you niggas is lukewarm
Cause everything I'm hearing sound just like the last song
Lately, I been, tired of rap
Might just drop this mixtape and never go looking back
Cause fact becoming fiction and fiction becoming fact
Written in 16's recorded over some trap
Nigga what?!
What the fuck is you saying?
Everything sound good with autotune and delay in
We all are fishers of men
These women be fish filleting
I been myself from the start and really don't plan on changing
Just fucking these beats up
You other rappers abstaining
So good at like everything
Don't know which lane I'mma stay in

[Hook]

[Change Up]
Welcome to Los Vegas[Verse 1: AK]
The eye on my forehead strong, like ion
Lyrical time bomb, burning holes through your teflon
The Painquillizer has arrived, your faith is on the line
Paper on the vine I inhale, and exhale the pine vapors all the time
Come a bit closer, get reacquainted with the messiah
Fuck astral planes, I seek higher
That limbic, try us, and one will find home within a lion
Triumph, I wear the belt like Orion
Indigo, individual, in the physical form
Spawn, you're a pawn in this chess game, check mate
Check if my check straight, check off that check, dog
Wordplay, I'm Cassius Clay, castaway, a tragic grace
Sometimes you gotta be secluded so your mind you can reclaim
You mere mortals can't tear portals, dimension and shift soil
With ascending masses, endo passing, leave them gassed with
Knowledge of our ancient ways
Better find yourself, elevate your brain
Meditate from the buddah like Buddhists
AK the truest, bluest Indigo huest
Jupiter origin soaring foreign the force within third eye
Swerve by the demons haunting men

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
The mind explorer of foreign towns
My Adventure Sound keep you niggas lifted
Break up a pound, no demons found
Hidden in our rasta, keep out all imposters
UA proper, got the knowledge from on top us
Golden rastas, holy fathers watch us prosper
Family first, niggas connected like we some mobsters
Uh, and yeah we float when we smoke
Sour so potent you choke, nigga we on a new coast, toast
I put up a force-field of eloquent verses
Rehearse, with the lords of this rap shit, the masters
We can't quit, or get your fucking third eye stripped
I'm focused, only a god could have wrote this
Levitating, a nigga flying with the savior
A creator of a haven, safe from haters
Perpetrators can not enter my medulla
Hallelujah, I'm the young light bearing shooter
We paving the way, changing the game, making our lane
Nigga, fuck is you saying, uh
UA came to the game, to save the day, making a change
How you gon' stop this nigga from feeding brains[Verse 1 : Lord Majin]

Flow bottomless like tar spits in the mosh pits
Monotonous bars spit like cheers turn to carcasses
Carvin' heartless novices regardless
If there harmless like sniper hands with parkinsons
Livin' in no rememberance remember this
Ill limmericks given to militant dominican immigrants
Who don't listen like rappers who lack discipline
Disciples decipher liars tired code sold tired old
And thrust it back into the fire like I was Richard Pryor
Prior to the fact that I'm a Wordsmith with the words lift with magical verbs spit

Make a hit out of weak shit call me somethin like a sire
Somethin like a villain Hogans black and white attire
Life sucks but i had a goodyear like a tire
Rappers talk shit leave 'em singin like a choir

Flow goes higher and higher and leave a nigga stranded like MacgyverI know I'll see you again
In another life
Thank you for sharing your love and your light
Though we say goodbye
We will say hello again
You'll always live in our hearts and our minds
Thank you for being a friend
That you were to me
I cherish the moments of all our good time
You traveled beyond
Your legacy lives on
Go forward as the eagle
To your endless majesty

I know I will see you again
In another life
Thank you for sharing your light with the world
Travel beyond
Your legacy lives on
Now enter the void
ForeverAncestors take my hand
From transgressions greater than
How I've been acting, I'm so ashamed
I can't take the pressure, I own the blame
I'm caving in, I'm on my way
Ancestors take my hand
Cause I can't take the pressure, it's greater than
All my skin and flesh, I'm so ashamed
When I finally get there, will you know my name?
Feel like ice to the snow chain
Feel like my life with the price of fame
Ancestors coldest pain
And why am I on the coldest train?
To become a hot coal deep within the dirt
To become a charcoal that knew its worth
To become that diamond inside that church

Yeah, ancestors take out hands[Verse 1: Captain Murphy]
Uh, uh-uh, ooooh
Welcome to paradise
Now, leave all your worries and
Other TV shows behind baby

Like the whole planet in the palms of my hands low
So give thumbs up for the Aqua TV Show[Verse 1: Taxi]
Snap a ringpull you thirsty little motherfucks
No King fool, lucky to work in Star fucking bucks
Serving Mocha Lattes to mothers who do Pilates
Wonder about the future waking up in a new Bugatti
Then fail, blame illuminati, or the middle east
Out scheming in Abu Dhabi with Jews, Germans and Sheiks
Learn the number of the beast, gaze at lame conspiracies
Children under delirium, take no responsibility
That’s why Taxi is killing thee, attack them on the track
Then they can really see that what they rap is wack
And I'm not just chatting smack, feel the high and take a hit
Tryna make a hit, get rich, relax a lil bit
Spit facts, if my name not on the back then you shit
Anyone else is legit, unless i gave a skit
Imagine that I’m a crip, don’t show me no disrespect
May not own a tech but I’ll still come for your neck
So watch your fucking step, inbetween me and a check
I’ll rob your watch and chain you bought reading complex
Stop talking and use your brain, specifically cortex
Walking round and round in circles, you wondering who’s up next

[Verse 2: Ginseng Benji]
Me? Posted in a hooptie, selling kiddies pot brownies
Got start-shit itis so he took the whole army
Eyes droopy and the bag of cinnamon toast crunch is with him
Kush got us all stuck like a Jedi force grip (Uhh)
Excuse me, I’m rather bent while I spit these testaments
Reckless, Hyde-ing how Momma raised him Jekyll-ish
Rap seriously sober, but drunk spits like a drone
Sentences molotov cocktails, toss ‘em up and then walk home
(Yup) The 99 problems of these niggas
And bitches are all of mine, so hold up for a minute
Shaded from the leaves falling from the cherry blossom tree
Sip the green tea and leaves, just describing what I seeLook around . . .you see all these snots next to you?
Believe it or not, they're scheming a plot just for you
They say they're your friends and treat you like God's best just to
Take advantage while you still think it's just all vegetables
Carrots and peas, whatever, you never can see reality
Bet you can see the pleasure in everything you've found to be
Fame and admiration, respect for just being how you be
Yeah, they'll always be there, unless they don't need your talents
Because you ain't nothing to them, you're just another tool
Another pawn, another piece to their newest puzzle fool
Man, why can't you see their using you?
Can't you see they only even noticed you because you know how to beat a Rubik's Cube?
Didn't mean to get that personal
But what's so wrong with a nerd keeping a rap journal?
In a middle school of cynical and idiotic imbeciles
Who brag about their clothes and then kid about their genitals
Guess I don't fit their rapper image
I don't wear the freshest styles or get the baddest women
I'm a skinny average kid with a different hat of tricks
A rabbit up his sleeve and a fist that hasn't hit
I hear, but without listening
And don't try to talk, cause I fear that I'll sound differently from them
So now my brains full of foul memories
I guess that's what I get for hanging around enemies[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
First off, I'm a start charging y'all per compliment
You give to me, see how much purse I can earn off of it
As far as bars, you heard wrong if you heard continent
It's incontinence, inconsequent turned sponsorin'
Rockin' a fur smock with some RC and
Go from rockin' a beat to just curb stomping it
Serve consonants hotter than hot combs (coals)
And surfing through brown (perm)anent germs that will jump off of it
Hot dogging with no condiments
Flow proper this show stopper be Bogarting it
Other niggas be going hard, and Early be going artisan
And lick fo' shot of the focus, more talkative
Too talkative, let the robbers in

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Off a couple Sake shots
Watching pot grow in short shorts and some soggy crocs
Shoddy lot of black faces trading body shots
For all of the belongings in your pocket, park it
Hardly not, gnarly tots, nollie pops
Use a bit, it got me; then she buzzin' like a walkie talk
Staying gold like the only watch that Lonny rocks
Grimey socks and you know you don't wanna play with papa swamp

[Verse 3: Captain Murphy]
So unorthodox
Chillin' with a shaman, eating ramen in a parking lot
I brought a bag of dreams with me, breathe the kundalini in
Exhale the meaning and the feeling of Elysium
Even the reason leavin' 'em lost, lyrical boss, harder than most
So kill me, martyrs at most my Holy ghost
Host a party in 'em, I brought my unruly souven-
Here on her blouse like a "Yours Truly" steel pin
Ether (Ha ha ha); they can't get past the deep voice
Conceived in a Rolls Royce, abortion life, pro choice
Goth hop, put a beanie on pitch bent like a leanin' song
Learn to fly and high at the first sign that I'm dreamin' on
The Force is strong with this one though
Over 9,000 midi-chlorians say so
Really show no mercy, all master, no Percy
Show these little bastards in the journeys of my troubled mind
Saddled by your blasphemy, look at what you found inside
Now you can't imagine me, running high the casualty and fucking die
This is why we had to bring the guns out
Rattled neighbors' windows every night until the sun's out
Two dudes, two odd crews with strange leaders
Kitty cats, a couple blunts, my new wang feeder[Verse 1: Realz Lector]
The grip on the Glock is not losing fuck the baggie epidemic
Murder rate so out of control, that gun control need a prefix
Dreams of blowing up I flirted with death flight 189
Wings being tampered Osama sending messages XXL here's proof
Who's really fucking with lyrically
Especially when I took a pack of purity
Hood specialist I teach coke to stretch like maternity
This shit is all mental, writing is forbidden
Genocide on paper-mates, penetrated like the New Brooklyn Stadium never
I remove the chains black people are no longer property, three bedrooms no that
I declare recall on all snitching
Jail time assisted like the district attorney is a fucking cutter

[Verse 2: KIN Bishop]
From the bottom of the swamp pit
Mad high niggas man we looking like a mosh pit
My mind drifts analyzing the world that we living in
Knowing this piece of shit would be better without a religion
And a government cause I'm above the shit
You getting spoon fed lies and I'm seeing through it
Rappers foolish speaking lies through lines
For me this more than rhymes, I write about my life
Your shit coming from everyone's but yours
That's fucking fake to me that shit I hate to see
Cause kids will buy into it, be fake cause they think its cool
They not gangstas neither is you, you don' bang you don't shoot
You ain't shit, and if you did you still be fake in my opinion
Cause you'd still be living a lie, cause we all know its not you
Shit you fooling the youth
But I'm back on my rapper shit
J's and smoking spliff's
Scuffed kicks cause we gotta hike just to cop that shit
That's one experience, but now its bongs and bowls
Until I'm old, I'm pretty sure i'll be gone before the grey grow
Like, Benicio Del Toro only after the Pesos
That's how these rapping niggas get old and I'm gone[Verse 1: Lachdown]
Homie I be port to port, never see my anchor drop
Bet that I can bag a bitch, Anchorage to Angkor Wat
Track Town girls though: chill as fuck, danker pot
Juicy ass, skinny mom, guess she gotta thank her pops
(Pause) Let the banger rock
Jaws on their ankles, lock-
-ing shit down steady till I'm ballin' with that banker guap
Fucking queens, Lancelot, look at me, I'm Hansel hot
State of mind on astronaut, shit I want the chance to cop
Keeps me fixated on validating the hatred
By making it just to claim
That I wasted it in front of your faces
Cop Bathing Apes for the laces
Vape an eighth for the fragrance
Y'all slanging paste to the tasteless
I'm aiming straight for the A-list
And laying pages for the ages like Amos my namesake had done
Glory's before me and y'all cornies who I'll take it from
I'm sui generis, flow is unsettling
Steady combust blunts of the med with Sloan Kettering

[Break: Step Brothers sample]
Johnny Hopkins and Sloan Kettering
Blazing that shit up every day

[Verse 2: Lachdown]
Peanuts are for pachyderms
All we do is pack and burn, pass the fern
Ash on my pants, khakis to match my urn
Class adjourned, until you chatty Kathies are taciturn
Rappers spurned ain't hath shit, so y'all my last concern
That's confirmed, by corroborating reports
That all you poseurs are pussies, and hunting pussy ain't sporting
I'd rather be out cavorting (What?), fornicating and touring
And contemplating the ways I can talk my way to a fortune
I'm a, lyrical cannonball, see me and the panties fall
Guarantee I'm packing plenty woody for these Annie Halls
(That's about the worst you could say about me)
You almost heard enough, know I got that multitouch
An 8 of my shit's worth your two joints: double dutch
Ducks don't need to huddle up, rush who's talking scuttlebutt
Voldemort a muggle fuck, I'm bugging off the bubba kush
Got me befuddled inagaddadavida, proppin' my feet up
Bitch it takes a quap when I re-up, ye-up[Verse 1: Teezy Kingz]

Hold up, Imma start spraying the whole block out, With a blunt in my hand, O.E. spilled on the ground, Found success in the bottom of a sticky jar, underage youth sneaking past the black shirts to go in bars, going very far, past mars she was scarred for life, uptown, downtown, it was only between her and her friend had a rough night past curfew they wasn't going in, They smelt the aroma from all the blunt smoking, Took a drag they were coughing started the calming, trying to find a way back home they solved it without a problem, got back to the crib on some other shit, No telling how they did, that's between them two they claim they best friends, I am like mayne I am fucking both of them (Repeat 2x)

[Verse 2: Teezy Kingz]

Off a couple bottles she swallowed looking like a model, skin perfect with wavy curves, you know I am about get my swerve, smoke to release my nerves, writing down different words, repeat my shit in case I slurred, I am on the border of classy not swaggy pants sometimes baggy like the first two Carters, drinking purple like it water, Yeah you know this motherfucker is going very far

[Verse 3: Teezy Kingz]

Imma do this shit right I promise you, Don't take me as no fucking fool, student at the hardknock school, dove in a sprite yea I am really smooth I want to be a legend like Kool Moe dude, and Big Poe too Rest In Peace to D.J. Screw, it ain't a thang to do but bang the Wayne to keep me sane blow away the fucking pain, fucking a bitch to T-Pain, the one that really sangs, I bet by the end of the night we have hella bed stains, and she don't where the fuck she at, cuz she den lost her brain[Hook]

Accepted or rejected cause they said you wasn't pure
"One drop makes you black"
Black sheep of the pack

Accepted by them niggas

[2nd Verse - Daem Write]
All these classifications on mixed relations, families interbreeding the nation that was born from immigration and slaves's raping from masters whose color was close to Casper but found power in black pussy being devoured. Now colors are classified to pacify and rationalize why, and children are put in positions to pick a side (live a lie) -- all they want to do is live a life like Bob Marley and Norris Wright, Booker T, to their hair, Fredrick Douglass white...

I wonder if Obama care?

Black or White we all be on OBAMACARE -- all be on that WELFARE. Color don’t really classify the wealth here. Its have or have not. Possess one drop. Possess bigots or drop tops. Are a trailer with a spot on a lot of the trailer park? Are efficiency by the park, light or dark. That one drop gone leave a mark!

You ever had to make those small decisions
In life were, you think that you're like dope as fuck
But you're really not, you're just lyrical, fuck

[Josh Wright]
Skipping over rocks, but I'm tripping over paper
That hooker that we did, now everybody hates us
We tripping through the wire, just for you to come and play us
No high fives (bye), cause, I"ma reflection through the mirrors edge
I don't condone with stupid heads, their all kinda bogus
I'm overflowing on this Flying Lotus, and you're girl wants a beat
So I gave her the salami, with a side of balls, the finest beef
Listen to this jonwayne flow, keeps you on an anity, the golden child
When I smile, I'm the family, I hate jealous pretenders, I'm in some fly suspenders
To keep you blended like the weed senders, plus, I'm overdose, or is it, over grown
I haven't even transcended, plus, my flow is over grown, shakespeare with the pen
This is the realest shit I ever wrote, ever spoke, Martin Luther King as the head pope
I'm even trying to leave you padless, I might never be discovered like atlantis, but
I'm telling you, I'm writing my new plans out like an atlas, keep me bagged, cause
You'll never get bad kid


(Hook)

If it was up to me, I'd set you free, I'd set you free, mentally
But it's funny how things change
When you want life to stay the same
When you start to catch feelings too
You just don't know what to do


(Verse)

I'm a beast in control
They blowin' more than smoke, I get the trees for these hoes
And they wonder I cry, sweat, and bleed in these shows
It's because I put a hunnid in, I do this for my brothers and--
My mother and my father and my grandma and my lover then--
Smoke til I'm dumber and, I'm focused on the summer man
I'm beatin on this pussy like a muthafuckin' drummer man
My flow is like a Pedigree and a Stone Cold Stunner man
Like the Undertaker, I'ma take ya soul
Rest in Peace to Macho, he's the one that let me know
That life is gonna be full of "I-told-you-so's"
But don't worry son I'ma fuck these hoes'--
Mindset-- I bet you thought I meant with the sex
These girls is still tryna get at me, I'm deletin' they texts
I got a album coming y'all ain't gonna know what's next
They expect nothing less than the best from the BEST


(Hook)

If it was up to me, I'd set you free, I'd set you free, mentally
But it's funny how things change
When you want life to stay the same
When you start to catch feelings too
You just dont know what to do
