"Go for mine,  and run down the line"
{*scratching*}
"Go for mine, and run down the line"

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Roley (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, "Holy moley!"
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lone, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

(Verse 2)
[Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical BUCK BUCK, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Ill Al Skratch]
Aiyyo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy with stakes

[Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fatal when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fucking final call

Hook: Ill Al Skratch
It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

Break 2: Easy Mo Bee
"For my one true"
"Our run's our rhyme"
"For my one"
{*scratching*}
"One true"
"For my one true"
"Our run"
"Our run"
"Run's"
"Our"
"Rhyme"

(Verse 3)
[Busta Rhymes]
Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You best believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, "Please give me room, yo step aside"
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
"Yo, throw the wax on" "How many emcees must get dissed"

[Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pave, ending 'em meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Wish Bone]
Living the psycho path so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once a
Gain enough to pick a defender
They try to contend us, see, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother, while smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, wit, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up, get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up[Anyway, it doesn't matter much how you feel
You know what you got to do, I'm here to do it
How about you?]

E-40:
Our age, five-years-old
We were young bucks
Scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub
Babysitter would send you to bed
But she would make me stay up
So she could give the young playa some viscious head uh
Early symptoms of
Time of nightway
Gigantic factor from the
Caukenis bitch tamer
Some had it all though
But less unfortunate
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose
And I had a Huffy
You owned a green machine
Three different lunch pails
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails
We grew up in the church together nigga
Sunday school
Now I heard you off into jackin nigga
That ain't even cool
I used to be conned, racked, fucked around
And ripped bad
Barking up on the wrong tree
Talking about runnin up in my past

[Mac Mall]
Niggas have hateful thoughts
But they stop me from strivin
Suckas be shakin salt
All in his gameful so find
Some fools be gettin crossed
Victims of faultiness
Man all that drama you come with
I swear you on some shit
Whether it's morphine or cocaine
Doja or doggfood
They had these marks for Tre and Max
Fuckin off my high breakin rules
You got ya P's mixed up
You ain't no pimp
You's a phoney
I spit for major mix
While you make tapes for ya homie
And then you work up tha nerve
To speak foul words
The pimp, a traitor, we instigators
That's why I wrote this verse
For every youngster with his mind on his meal
Young playa just chill
And take a look at what these fakers call real
Nigga

[Big Mike]
I trust no man
Cuz man will let you down every time
That's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme
Cuz I've seen better times
And I've seen worser days
When some of my so called friends
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say
I quench my thirst today
With righteous thoughts of mind
Cuz righteous thought of mind will leave mark ass niggas far behind
I seen it every time
They come and go
That's why I drop to my knees
And ask god to distinguish friend from foe
And what do you know
By the time morning comes I can see the light
And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene
Countin' greens
Straight from H-town to New Orleans
New human beings puttin it down like a mic or not
Replace the slot open up shop
We 'bout to make it hot
Stop
With ya devilish doins
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know

[8ball]
Listen
I'm tryin to tell you my nigga to watch cha back
And trust few
Cause ain't no nigga gon watch ya back for you like you
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust
See let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make
Don't want no bustas around me
Playa hatin or actin fake
Don't ever be wantin nobody to get to close
I don't know if it's effects of
From the marijuana that got me more than trippin
See nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone?
See, my partners who used to ride with me
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll?
Maybe they will, maybe they won't
Who is to say what a nigga will do
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help you
See what I'm sayin, listen to me and see if you can dig this
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people recieve ends
Now all of a sudden I'm actin funny because my moneys loaned
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin you don't already know
Personal business, you got to watch who you friends is

[MJG]
I'm thinking about hard times
Freeing my mind
Who in the fuck goin be my crutch?
Holdin me up, helpin me out
Makin sure that I stay in touch
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to?
When I be low on my cash
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin bout kickin my ass?
Who is my friends who is my foes?
Who do I ask, when I want to know
Somethin about somethin but I don't know nothin
My ignorance be keepin me out in the cold
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride?
In somebody elses car
How do I get from point A to B if B is just to far?
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone?
Who's goin to give me the permission to make a decision
To come up in they house and live
When will I drive a BMer takin my clothes to the cleaner
How can I know
Will I forever be payin my dues, will I forever be singing the blues?
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin to lean
Know what I mean?
When I be needin some justification
Stuck in the fuckin same location
Who is the friend that is helpin me?
Who is the busta thats hurtin me?
Who can I trust?
Will you be there when the goin is tough?
Will I be hangin with dick in the dust?
Who wanna share my load when it's too heavy to carry?
Or will I go crazy pullin the load alone?
Constantly gettin my hustle on
When will I finally see, kinda suspect
Or even actually know
Who is my real friend thick and the thin?
And who in the fuck is the foe?

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know...[ VERSE 1: Prode'je ]
Another soldier from the Central with the 80 in my pocket
A nigga's knocked it and I fucked him like socket
Cleared his fuckin ass, cause I never play the last place
So now he's walkin with the muthafuckin gas face
That's right, I'm burnin muthafuckas like a arsonist
I have you walkin like a crippled and retarted bitch
I never fuck around when I'm with a team of fuckin gangsters
Westcoast freestyle bangsters
Kickin a foot up in yo ass like Pele
And prosecute like the muthafuckin D.A
I'm rollin a small coupe drop through the hood of gees
And hittin the chips on the undercover p-i-g's
I'm givin a fuck about naythin, muthafucka Satan
Cause I'm the only nigga crematin
Fool, the Prod came out heartless
Gang related, don't be anohter nigga on my shitlist

[ Hook ]
I don't waste a minute, muthafuckas I be smokin
(I got another gang story to tell, peep)
Sometimes I walk around strapped, nigga
(I got another gang story to tell, peep) --] MC Eiht

[ VERSE 2: Tre-Duce ]
Back up in the hood I thought you knew, oh punks, you didn't know
Though you got a grip you're gettin dropped like a sixty-fo'
I put my foot up in your ass so far
I'm leavin prints on your neckline, signed 'Mr. Bogart'
Another victim of society
Why did you lie to me?
So I gotta use my strap daily
And take you muthafuckas out
It coulda been prevented, but the niggas was sho' from the sto'
A.K.-47 ways to heaven
I took em for a 211
And left his ass with 187
Just a another nigga dead and gone
He fell victim to the chrome as I punched in the gold broam
I roll the streets with a murder rep
I'm known for kickin hoes and niggas' necks and causin istant death
Young niggas goin in and comin out winnin
The gang story that a nigga's tellin

[ Hook ]

[ Havoc The Mouthpiece ]
South Central L.A. is the gang capital of the world
Where niggas walk around strapped daily
And won't hesitate to smoke yo ass in a minute
Take it from the Mouthpiece
This is just another Gang Story

[ VERSE 3: Havikk The Rhimeson ]
Back up in the hood, oh yes, I'm back
I'm leavin your fuckin skull marinated in the heat as I creep
I'm stickin my shoe up in your ass so far
My shoestring will look like hemorrhoids as you're lyin in the fuckin morgue
I gives a fuck when I creep
I told you I was evil as a nigga when I'm lyin by the devil 'sleep
I let the slugs fly quick
The Tec-22 is in your ass like flies on shit
I'm from the dephts down below, the groundward
The graveyard, rockin you niggas, cause I'm that hard
Rhimeson casuin havoc for the underground
You fuck around, you lay around, and yo, you hang around
I'm puttin niggas on graveshift
The Glock-9 plays connect the dots off in your ass, bitch
The hardest nigga with a g slang
'94, here we go, muthafuckas, it's a g thang

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 4: Big Mike ]
Just another muthafucka who got tore down
Came home and beat his ho down
Bust shots at the police and lost the showdown
Low down, but now his little brother's stuck on payback
Rollin through the hood, and them little niggas stay strapped
What can I say, black? B.G. is heartless
Usin one-time as targets, I warned you not to start this
Cause he's down with some down-ass niggas from around the way
It be that way, they got they nuts off fo' deep, and they down to play
Anything you hoes wanna do
(Well, bust a right at the light, come back and bomb that corner, fool)
Four young niggas ready to fuck your cap up
Left three niggas dead, and you thought they wouldn't act up?
Zip the sack up, and wipe the blood off of the flo'
Started some shit, and now they got everybody at each other's throats
Kinda fucked up, but that's the way it be
These niggas don't be playin on these muthafuckin streets

[ VERSE 1 ]
Time brings change and change comes with time
Throughout these years I learned to get down for mine
Had to do some crime with the attitude of not giving a fuck
Born with no luck, refused to stay stuck
I made the bucks, did what I had to, I did what I could
My rise to the top was no surprise cause I knew that I would
Make it, oh, the chance, I had to take it
Fake it never because that nigga was too clever
If there ever was a motherfucker down for his crown
It had to be me, the B-i-g M-i-k-e, straight gee
Come sun down, come sun up, gun up
For them niggas who wanna run up
Whatchamacallit came up short, that nigga done what?
Fool, this big black nigga don't go for no losses
I had to get rid of my runner, so I recruited more horses
Down with neighborhood bosses, I made a connection and rose
Later for elbows and Vogue's, I just kick back and stack rolls and hoes

[ Hook: Pimp C ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Times are changing, I'm living my life in and out the door, black
Lounging here and there, somethin screamin in my ear
"Michael go back home," but I ain't really sure, black
I gots to get my shit together the right way, nigga, I know that
Coming up short swinging by the tail and
Thinking of a master plan, this nigga's bailing
Down the road, and I promised not to look back
At what I once had, what I have now, what I left, and what I once took, black
Shook that, now I'm in my own realm
Controlling shit, kicking it, never knew life could be so damn well
I got mine, everything fell in line
Time brought change and change came with time

[ Hook: Pimp C ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Lock another nigga up, throw away the fucking key
That's the way they punish me, motherfuck society
I could spend a century in the penitentiary
It won't make a difference, gee, cause ain't nobody missing me
Round and round and round we go, a different day, a different face
Damn, I wish I could run away, I hate this motherfucking place
Too many goddamn rules, that's why I quit school
Giving me a crooked test, I ain't no damn fool
Can't walk out my house because they always in my face
And if I step out of place they wanna give me a case
Ain't no difference between society and the jailhouse
Everybody's locked up and wanna get the hell out
Just cause you ain't locked down you think you got it good
But you better think again cause the police
Are checking niggas in the neighborhood
Beating our ass down
Cause society is just like the pen, so get ready for the lockdown
Clock now while you can, man
Huh, cause it's all about havin' thangs
And I'mma get mine, fool
Time brought change and change came with time

[ Hook: Pimp C ][Intro: Pimp C]
Huh... had to bring it back for the muthafuckin 2006
It's goin down bitch! (fly hoes and chains and swangin thangs)
Y'all remember that shit? (remember that shit?) Talkin 'bout?
(Just another young playa havin thangs man...)
Check this shit out... uh!

[Pimp C]
It's really goin down in the God damn South
Young girls poppin pussy with them golds in their mouth
Young boys comin up, layin it down in the cut
Never fallin in a rut cause life was made for us to strut (strut!)
Never take for granted, take the bull by the horns (horns!)
Sippin on somethin sweet, blowing green popcorn (corn!)
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end my nigga
The underdog, young hog, fuck the pen my nigga!
Cuz it's a waste of bodies (bodies!), a waste of time (time!)
A waste of spiritual energy, and a waste of mind (mind!)
You ain't really tough cause you been down there fool
Everybody tryna get back to they families on the cool
I rather grip on grain (grain!), get head in the lane (lane!)
You can have them hoes' bodies, I'm possessing they brains (possessing they
Brains!)
Comin up on 'em in a wide body frame
Hoping you ain't forgot the name, I'm out here havin thangs!

[Hook x2: Pimp C]
Fly hoes and chains and swanging thangs

[Big Mike]
(Yeah! Big Mike y'all! Yeah!)
From CD sales to jail cells
From diamonds that shine to eatin slop straight up off a chow line
From walkin that fine line uhh, to 12 jurors decidin mine
From bein free, to bein confined
From bein loved, to bein despised, many times I cried
For not allowin that bullshit to slide
It was a pill that I couldn't swallow - load up the strap with the hollows
After takin to the head a whole bottle
I did that, not thinkin twice about the consequences
'Til I served damn near 4 years behind the fences (Straight G)
All my folk were like, "Big Mike, you trippin"
"Get it together," if I could I woulda done somethin different
Uh! From G-walkin to slippin, yeah, to flippin them calendar pages
Day after day, sweatin 'em out in them cages
Patiently waiting on the day when I can.. get back at it
Work that magic, collect that cabbage, I gotsta have it

Trippy stangs, business on my brain
Perfect in my lane, I woke up early in the, early in the game
Different lanes, but it's all the same
Just the other day, I woke up early in the, early in the game
Then I floated off, then I hit the weed, then I drop that top, disregard that speed
That's a pricey watch, now I rolled up my sleeves
You nigga's sleeping, but I woke up early in the game

Jewelry so froze, I'll be on that no do's
Knock left, grand respect, super skinny, low pro's
Had to hop up on my ass and chase it
Now success I'm bout to grab, I can taste it
Throw that luggage overboard, them nigga's dead weight
Celebrate your new beginning pop some champagne
And never let them fuckers pull you back in
She out of pockets as the hoe’s only a back in
Liquor pourin, kitty purrin, know she trynna creep
And cocaine niggas be the hottest on the streets
Pull up in a Viper on them ghetto corners
This shit here be dedicated to better mornings

My wrist is chunky, that coupe is soupy
My pinky Disney, she call it Goofy
Taylor Gang, Coke Boyz, this my call of duty
Got 94 versace frames and a baby coogi
I got the block, ain't pay you niggas no man
Now a nigga cleaned up, I look good, don't I?
Two and a few, me and chinx the same

I put nitrous on a kid's stroller and roll it down a hill
Grab your white pants and Folger's and "accidentally" spill
Put Kool-Aid powder on your flowers, wait about an hour
And as the rain showers down to the ground your plants will be killed
Best believe your frown will be filled
I'm burning a forest down for every house that be build
It's so astounding a thrill to have a heart pounding with thrill
I'm relieving rap game pain like you're downing a pill, uh
Poor kids living in a poor city (thirsty)
I pour some water on the ground and make them plant look more pretty (curse me)
You better cake up with that makeup cause those pores look shitty
I give the wrong answers to kids and they end up scoring fifties
My good friend wanted headphones, he's the best guy
So I bought some at Best Buy and sent them to a deaf guy
Crazy? Nah, I just like to say I have a blessed mine
I'll kick a cop's ass before they can ever arrest mine

I was put on the earth to cause headaches and neck pains
It's been said that hell raise because of my birth
But it hardly marks a party 'til somebody gets hurt
In third grade, I left the bully's blood on the turf
And I done it with mirth, and I gun at the first chance to force the gimmick
As I aim Yo Mama jokes at orphaned children
I make all the gorgeous women follow portion limits
I tell dead baby jokes at abortion clinics
And of course I get it, I ain't no bumbling idiot
I'm just the chief executive at Monkey Business
There ain't no money in it, it's just some funny shit
I use big words, all the chicks love a cunning linguist
They be like "Jesus, isn't he really cool?"
As I push another paraplegic in a kiddy pool
And if humor is a global health hazard
I'll laugh at kids in Africa and go to hell after cause

I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails
We grew up in the church together nigga
Sunday school
Now I heard you off into jackin nigga
That ain't even cool
I used to be conned, racked, fucked around
And ripped bad
Barking up on the wrong tree
Talking about runnin up in my past

[Mac Mall]
Niggas have hateful thoughts
But they stop me from strivin
Suckas be shakin salt
All in his gameful so find
Some fools be gettin crossed
Victims of faultiness
Man all that drama you come with
I swear you on some shit
Whether it's morphine or cocaine
Doja or doggfood
They had these marks for Tre and Max
Fuckin off my high breakin rules
You got ya P's mixed up
You ain't no pimp
You's a phoney
I spit for major mix
While you make tapes for ya homie
And then you work up tha nerve
To speak foul words
The pimp, a traitor, we instigators
That's why I wrote this verse
For every youngster with his mind on his meal
Young playa just chill
And take a look at what these fakers call real
Nigga

[Big Mike]
I trust no man
Cuz man will let you down every time
That's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme
Cuz I've seen better times
And I've seen worser days
When some of my so called friends
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say
I quench my thirst today
With righteous thoughts of mind
Cuz righteous thought of mind will leave mark ass niggas far behind
I seen it every time
They come and go
That's why I drop to my knees
And ask god to distinguish friend from foe
And what do you know
By the time morning comes I can see the light
And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene
Countin' greens
Straight from H-town to New Orleans
New human beings puttin it down like a mic or not
Replace the slot open up shop
We 'bout to make it hot
Stop
With ya devilish doins
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know

[8ball]
Listen
I'm tryin to tell you my nigga to watch cha back
And trust few
Cause ain't no nigga gon watch ya back for you like you
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust
See let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make
Don't want no bustas around me
Playa hatin or actin fake
Don't ever be wantin nobody to get to close
I don't know if it's effects of
From the marijuana that got me more than trippin
See nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone?
See, my partners who used to ride with me
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll?
Maybe they will, maybe they won't
Who is to say what a nigga will do
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help you
See what I'm sayin, listen to me and see if you can dig this
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people recieve ends
Now all of a sudden I'm actin funny because my moneys loaned
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin you don't already know
Personal business, you got to watch who you friends is

[MJG]
I'm thinking about hard times
Freeing my mind
Who in the fuck goin be my crutch?
Holdin me up, helpin me out
Makin sure that I stay in touch
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to?
When I be low on my cash
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin bout kickin my ass?
Who is my friends who is my foes?
Who do I ask, when I want to know
Somethin about somethin but I don't know nothin
My ignorance be keepin me out in the cold
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride?
In somebody elses car
How do I get from point A to B if B is just to far?
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone?
Who's goin to give me the permission to make a decision
To come up in they house and live
When will I drive a BMer takin my clothes to the cleaner
How can I know
Will I forever be payin my dues, will I forever be singing the blues?
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin to lean
Know what I mean?
When I be needin some justification
Stuck in the fuckin same location
Who is the friend that is helpin me?
Who is the busta thats hurtin me?
Who can I trust?
Will you be there when the goin is tough?
Will I be hangin with dick in the dust?
Who wanna share my load when it's too heavy to carry?
Or will I go crazy pullin the load alone?
Constantly gettin my hustle on
When will I finally see, kinda suspect
Or even actually know
Who is my real friend thick and the thin?
And who in the fuck is the foe?

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know...[ VERSE 1: Prode'je ]
Another soldier from the Central with the 80 in my pocket
A nigga's knocked it and I fucked him like socket
Cleared his fuckin ass, cause I never play the last place
So now he's walkin with the muthafuckin gas face
That's right, I'm burnin muthafuckas like a arsonist
I have you walkin like a crippled and retarted bitch
I never fuck around when I'm with a team of fuckin gangsters
Westcoast freestyle bangsters
Kickin a foot up in yo ass like Pele
And prosecute like the muthafuckin D.A
I'm rollin a small coupe drop through the hood of gees
And hittin the chips on the undercover p-i-g's
I'm givin a fuck about naythin, muthafucka Satan
Cause I'm the only nigga crematin
Fool, the Prod came out heartless
Gang related, don't be anohter nigga on my shitlist

Back up in the hood I thought you knew, oh punks, you didn't know
Though you got a grip you're gettin dropped like a sixty-fo'
I put my foot up in your ass so far
I'm leavin prints on your neckline, signed 'Mr. Bogart'
Another victim of society
Why did you lie to me?
So I gotta use my strap daily
And take you muthafuckas out
It coulda been prevented, but the niggas was sho' from the sto'
A.K.-47 ways to heaven
I took em for a 211
And left his ass with 187
Just a another nigga dead and gone
He fell victim to the chrome as I punched in the gold broam
I roll the streets with a murder rep
I'm known for kickin hoes and niggas' necks and causin istant death
Young niggas goin in and comin out winnin
The gang story that a nigga's tellin

[ Hook ]

[ Havoc The Mouthpiece ]
South Central L.A. is the gang capital of the world
Where niggas walk around strapped daily
And won't hesitate to smoke yo ass in a minute
Take it from the Mouthpiece
This is just another Gang Story

[ VERSE 3: Havikk The Rhimeson ]
Back up in the hood, oh yes, I'm back
I'm leavin your fuckin skull marinated in the heat as I creep
I'm stickin my shoe up in your ass so far
My shoestring will look like hemorrhoids as you're lyin in the fuckin morgue
I gives a fuck when I creep
I told you I was evil as a nigga when I'm lyin by the devil 'sleep
I let the slugs fly quick
The Tec-22 is in your ass like flies on shit
I'm from the dephts down below, the groundward
The graveyard, rockin you niggas, cause I'm that hard
Rhimeson casuin havoc for the underground
You fuck around, you lay around, and yo, you hang around
I'm puttin niggas on graveshift
The Glock-9 plays connect the dots off in your ass, bitch
The hardest nigga with a g slang
'94, here we go, muthafuckas, it's a g thang

[ VERSE 4: Big Mike ]
Just another muthafucka who got tore down
Came home and beat his ho down
Bust shots at the police and lost the showdown
Low down, but now his little brother's stuck on payback
Rollin through the hood, and them little niggas stay strapped
What can I say, black? B.G. is heartless
Usin one-time as targets, I warned you not to start this
Cause he's down with some down-ass niggas from around the way
It be that way, they got they nuts off fo' deep, and they down to play
Anything you hoes wanna do
(Well, bust a right at the light, come back and bomb that corner, fool)
Four young niggas ready to fuck your cap up
Left three niggas dead, and you thought they wouldn't act up?
Zip the sack up, and wipe the blood off of the flo'
Started some shit, and now they got everybody at each other's throats
Kinda fucked up, but that's the way it be
These niggas don't be playin on these muthafuckin streets

Time brings change and change comes with time
Throughout these years I learned to get down for mine
Had to do some crime with the attitude of not giving a fuck
Born with no luck, refused to stay stuck
I made the bucks, did what I had to, I did what I could
My rise to the top was no surprise cause I knew that I would
Make it, oh, the chance, I had to take it
Fake it never because that nigga was too clever
If there ever was a motherfucker down for his crown
It had to be me, the B-i-g M-i-k-e, straight gee
Come sun down, come sun up, gun up
For them niggas who wanna run up
Whatchamacallit came up short, that nigga done what?
Fool, this big black nigga don't go for no losses
I had to get rid of my runner, so I recruited more horses
Down with neighborhood bosses, I made a connection and rose
Later for elbows and Vogue's, I just kick back and stack rolls and hoes

Times are changing, I'm living my life in and out the door, black
Lounging here and there, somethin screamin in my ear
"Michael go back home," but I ain't really sure, black
I gots to get my shit together the right way, nigga, I know that
Coming up short swinging by the tail and
Thinking of a master plan, this nigga's bailing
Down the road, and I promised not to look back
At what I once had, what I have now, what I left, and what I once took, black
Shook that, now I'm in my own realm
Controlling shit, kicking it, never knew life could be so damn well
I got mine, everything fell in line

Lock another nigga up, throw away the fucking key
That's the way they punish me, motherfuck society
I could spend a century in the penitentiary
It won't make a difference, gee, cause ain't nobody missing me
Round and round and round we go, a different day, a different face
Damn, I wish I could run away, I hate this motherfucking place
Too many goddamn rules, that's why I quit school
Giving me a crooked test, I ain't no damn fool
Can't walk out my house because they always in my face
And if I step out of place they wanna give me a case
Ain't no difference between society and the jailhouse
Everybody's locked up and wanna get the hell out
Just cause you ain't locked down you think you got it good
But you better think again cause the police
Are checking niggas in the neighborhood
Beating our ass down
Cause society is just like the pen, so get ready for the lockdown
Clock now while you can, man
Huh, cause it's all about havin' thangs
And I'mma get mine, fool
Time brought change and change came with time

Never take for granted, take the bull by the horns (horns!)
Sippin on somethin sweet, blowing green popcorn (corn!)

The underdog, young hog, fuck the pen my nigga!
Cuz it's a waste of bodies (bodies!), a waste of time (time!)
A waste of spiritual energy, and a waste of mind (mind!)
You ain't really tough cause you been down there fool

From CD sales to jail cells
From diamonds that shine to eatin slop straight up off a chow line
From walkin that fine line uhh, to 12 jurors decidin mine
From bein free, to bein confined
From bein loved, to bein despised, many times I cried
For not allowin that bullshit to slide
It was a pill that I couldn't swallow - load up the strap with the hollows
After takin to the head a whole bottle
I did that, not thinkin twice about the consequences
'Til I served damn near 4 years behind the fences (Straight G)
All my folk were like, "Big Mike, you trippin"
"Get it together," if I could I woulda done somethin different
Uh! From G-walkin to slippin, yeah, to flippin them calendar pages
Day after day, sweatin 'em out in them cages
Patiently waiting on the day when I can.. get back at it
Work that magic, collect that cabbage, I gotsta have it

[Hook] - repeat 2X[Verse 1: Walker M]
I'm just another Rainy City rapper wishing you good morning
My eyes to the sky and my idols in California
Warning, there's more in store you can't get rid of me
It's chilly but I'm hot, believe it or not, Ripley
Simply put, you asked for it, matter of fact tacked the shit
Up in your tackle box and went out fishing for compliments
And confidence is key, luckily I rap incredibly
Wanna be big, but stay lowkey like Thor's enemy
I hit you like a hammer with my quote and quote humility
I used to pay for gigs and now the venues writing checks to me
Intent to recompense the gifts that I've been given
Cause music is my life and I just breathe to make a living
So when I die, I want you all to know me as the guy
Who let prophesizing Mayans try and drive his white suburban life
And asking why he'd take me for a ride, I took a knife
And showed his approximate apocalypse an Aztec sacrifice
Yeah, and that was nice, rhyming while I'm eating rice
And chowing down on chow mein cause I'm half-Asian and half-white
Little wop, mobster-like, marveling at Robin's tights
Dropping cops, quickly robbing fobs of their Miranda rights
Mobbing on 'em, non stopping, spitting fire tryna light?
Sloppy hand job, jocking zombie-like, I lost my mind
Got a mic, so I tell it how it is
And how we're more than just a couple over-privileged white kids
North of Oregon, whoring out our gifts to so-and-so again
With lips licked, engrossed in studios to make recordings in
'Course I'm out of style, rocking fitteds and not snaps
And you're hopping bandwagon, kangarooing in a Yankees cap
Back to where I started at, Kangley and a Road of Wax
East Hill chilling on the rail tracks
Bumping KMAC, DnS Mixtape I got dat
Piff-puffing the magic dragon, you can ask me all about that

[Break]
You can ask me all about that
You can ask me all about that
You can ask me all about that
You can ask me all about that

[Verse 2: Walker M]
I get high and waisted like a hipster's best pair of pants
Music in my heart ever since my life began
Anne Frankly I've been hiding out, hoping for a chance to drop a track
And get my name well established around the world and back
And whack rappers boring me, I got the authority
To call them all bitches, the whole game is a sorority
That'll never change, cause it makes up who I am
I'm a slacker, cracking jokes like knuckles and cracker jack
I'm not religious, but I say that I'm a Catholic
Slacking, cash, stacks, racks, hash and ass my six sacraments
And rap is both the seventh and my ticket into heaven
Cause I kill these beats, confess my sins and then ask for repentance
I'm a white and yellow rapper, sorta like a Trojan
A rap surprise attack a Trojan horse of forced importance
California calls my name, and Seattle does the same
Cause the west coast is best coast and that'll never change

[Break]
And that'll never change
And that'll never change
And that'll never change
And that'll never change[ VERSE 1: Big Mike ]
On the real, baby, I ain't got no ends
Yeah, I got a record out, but I ain't got no Benz
You ought to be glad that I'm givin yo ass somethin
Cause it's some niggas out there that ain't givin up nothin
Then he got a baby, but the nigga don't take care of it
Anything I make, my baby always gets a share of it
Yeah, a young nigga tryin to make it
And it's gettin harder when you're always on my back tryin to take it
And it ain't even gotta be like that
Gettin at me like that ain't gon' get your fuckin pockets fat
Used to have some love for you, but now you're just a selfish bitch
Takin all my money, spendin it on your self and shit
Or that nigga that you stayin with, layin with
But on the real, I ain't that nigga you should be playin with
Cause when I'm dead
Ain't nobody gonna take care of another man's kids, he might, shit
Nine times out of ten they don't
Nine times out of ten them muthafuckas won't
So baby, pump, pump yo brakes and put a end to all them ho games
Cause ho games equals no game

The only way I roll em if I catch em on sale, bro
Huh, I'm like you, tryin to get my hustle on
Ain't got time for no muthafuckin scuffle, homes
I'm sellin records, and you be sellin crack
I got fans, you got the police on your back
But I don't knock you, cause I used to do the same
So don't knock me cause I'm in a different game
See, it's still about comin up
Still about puttin niggas on they ass if they be runnin up
Different game, same atttitude

I see you walking around like you's a motherfucking star
Expensive clothes high class hoes
Right now you're on top of the world I suppose
Claiming that you're macking but I know that you ain't
The only time you can pull a ho is when you [pulling] out your bank
Taking [on] my [wine] and my gang and shit
So you can get your dick wet mister slick
But after all that yo you still can't keep her
'cos a nigga likes myself can come along and sweep her
And have her screaming oh big mike
Nigga you slanging them dollars but you ain't slanging that dick
Why now you know I [???] your ho so now you run and get your pistol
Madder than a bitch screaming that I dissed you
But nigga I ain't diss you you know the story joe
Don't check the motherfucking pimp check the ho

Now baby's playing for your money you're playing her for her drawers
She takes your money brings it to me I'm playing both of y'all
Who's the mack who's the motherfucking pimp
Who's the motherfucking man and who's the motherfucking simp
It ain't me 'cos I ain't giving up a penny
Steady fucking her while you be giving up plenty
Now nigga tell the truth I ain't a dunce
Out of the six times I fucked her you might have fucker her once
And after you caught a nut you had to get up prime time
And take her to the nearest store so she could spend your dough
Every time you fucked her you got to pay a fee
And oh yeah thanks for getting her hair done for me g
It looked good when she came over the other day
Sucking on my dick all I could see was her hair anyway
Remember that shirt that she bought you on your birthday
I got two of those and pair of pants and shoes on the first day

Huh I'm just a playa y'all

Now every time you see her you want to grab her butt
And act like you love her but she don't give a fuck
Don't want to meet your friends don't to drive your benz
Just want to get your ends and then she's gone again uh
Flipping on a mission with another nigga you know
Even though you try your hardest you can't figure this so
Seen it before but you still laying down for the tramp
Gave you some pussy got you sprung and then she just up and [vamp]
Now tell me what that be like
Bought her some shit to wear [???] for her hair she with me right

When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Roley (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, "Holy moley!"
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I , loc, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lawn, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

[Doodlebug]
Well, I travel the land like my man in Kung Fu
Marching up this hip-hop scene with my Digable crew
Now you and you know the science so don't front
Cause Brooklyn won't front, nah we don't front
In fact, it's getting like a Daily Operation
See Knowledge Born represents my young nation
And I'm facing opposition in every form
So my Manchu Squad seven odds is on a swarm, like crazily
Cause it don't pay to be, a black man in a land of mental slavery
They say Cash Rules Everything Around Me, true
So what I got to do to be as lavish as you?
I don't roll with no crew, and do the same old same
So I travel the seventh plane by way of Coltrane
Now that's an ill thought, niggas get caught in my wisdom
Because the number Seven is like the master of a rhythm

[Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fakes fell when my heat made a sound
Now, hogging nonbelievers gonna fall
When my niggas make the fucking final call
We started out small, now we got 'em stepping nationwide
1995, one minute, heads are gonna fly
With that rootin' tootin', Southside shooting
Booting any nigga who ain't trooping with Huey Newton
Fuck disputing and it's time for a change
Nigga, what you gon' do, when we rearrange the game?
Blow 'em out the frame with new ideas
We's about to gain leverage putting it down out here

Break 1: Easy Mo Bee

"Go for mine, and run down the line"

"Go for mine, and run down the line"

[Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the god on my side
And the god S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
"Yo, throw the wax on" "How many emcees must get dissed"
The mist from the blunt smoke decides who's next on my list
Can you feel the hiss from the snake moving my direction?
No u-turn, you getting burned from the sun in my intersection
The god has spoken, sword stroken
If you think you ready for a fair one, pay your token
On my soul train, control your brain
Bucktown representative, break it down like a ki' of cocaine
Straight from the lab, and I still elevate past the snakes in the grass
Fuck it

[Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the best, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical buck-buck, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Ill Al Skratch]
Aiyyo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy like Mo Bee
The ex-convict on some Vietnam shit, criminal
On the subliminal, (Niggas!) watch what your women do
All the bitches wanna know why the frames I (rock)
That's just the "blacka blam" from the Glock
Bear witness, (to my mental fitness, no fear,)
Precaution, (maybe) too se-(vere) for your (ear)
People round pro, on the down low, let off a round slow
Subtle, (and leave you in a) puddle
Breaker, Breaker, 1,9
Cause it ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

[Rock]
I can rhyme as long as my dick, get bucked
I grabs the mic and I do's what the fuck I want
I'll outlast any blunt,  White Owl, Philly or a Dutch Master
Raw like a natural disaster, as I crack ya ass like cheap plaster
I might bash ya, while my tongue lash ya, when the Rock cruise, I crash ya, Leave or get your car wrecked
And I give a tribute to the Ripper Tek, and I slash ya
After I'm show that you jokes, I go see my bro with the 'fro when we toast
All the punks 'pon the planet, plus every single fool
Cause without all of y'all, Heltah Skeltah wouldn't prove what we do

[Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pavement, them meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Wish Bone]
Deliver the psychopath, so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once again
Enough to pick a defender they try to contend us
See, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother
While smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, wit, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up, get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You better believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me coincide, "Please give me room, yo step aside"
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Dee]
I hang with blacks and you hang with whites
I pack a nine and  I don't like fights
I'm from the deepest darkest ghetto streets of South Central L.A.,
I jack for Jewels, watch where you bail
It's right across the street from Hell
And no one said to repent, went to the liquor store
Blast on the cashier, just like I did last year
Now tell me if you was there, would you be down?
When them black boys beat Reginald Denny to the ground?
Now, a brother beat me for a dollar, I shot him for the buck of it
I try to rap (?) some white people, they said change that shit
This is West Coast Rap-A-Lot
I smoke the Houston Astrals Hat a lot
I shot a punk for hitting me up

[Assassin]
Down to wet something up, that's opposing my cause
What's the difference between this and Hell with gasoline drawers? I live a sick lifestyle, my profile shows I'm in this
Handling business, to defend this, Justice is cause for action
My people tell me "don't hold a strap, Man"
I don't give a damn, South Central and
Looking out for the black man, struggling with my brother man
Roll with the Clan, brokers ride the Tascam
It's us against the man, and I'ma damn get shot
They'll have to put me into jail, cause I ain't going for the clock
Turning pig wigs to mop, time for the bullshit to stop
I got a hood I die for, been organized since '64

[Jamal]
Jamal gets down, the master of bringing the massacre
Rolling on crews like Pirellis on Acuras
If you don't believe my steez is real
You can check the emptiness of my Glock 9-mil'
It don't matter which way you come
I still be the nigga calling shots with the gun
I lick one shot, I make your whole squad run
None is about to fuck with the son
Mally G, I never kick a rhyme for free
Function rap skills, I come live like TV
For all of y'all, I come across to be real
With super shit like Fall Guy, in lines to make 'em all die
Infrared beams, mind full of schemes
95 'til keep it real, get the cream
Fuck around and get dropped, it don't stop, Nahmean?[Intro: Scarface Talking]
Legalizing abortion, ain't that a bitch?!
Ugh, ugh..

[Scarface]
These busted ass whores are going crazy
You might as well take up ? and point them at babies..
And watch their motherfucking brains, split
And take the rep for the murder you did, you son of a bitch
Cause killing babies ain't gank
Suppose your mamma would've flushed your ass down her ass crack
You dumb ass whores with no hope for
Killing babies ain't shit, you wanna vote for
They're just trying to wipe her ass out
Cause the niggas be the ones with their bellies all poked out
And even like to be decided by another
You need to pass me a gat, and let me kill some of you motherfuckers
That's why I'm glad we got niggas
Because this world would be fucked if it was ran by you stupid bitches
At least give the kids a chance
And if you're going unprotected, keep your pussy in your panties
Cause you whores will get the Guillotine
If I was the judge for one of you bitches killing off the unseen

[Bushwick Bill]
What the fuck is this protesting?
Legalizing killing babies and shit with no question
Police beating up the freeze cutie
Cause they were praying for the unseen dead bodies
And us niggas ain't playing that game, bitch
Fuck George Bush for supporting that lame shit
And While I'm at him fuck way too
Little murdered more innocents cause they cooperated bitch you
Get the dick out of your mouth
And wake up because you're sending these kids to the slaughter house
Instead of sending out niggas to the meets cutter
You need to send some of these gay motherfuckers
Ugh, now listen to me ladies: Howcome you're killing them?
But don't pity your little babies
Now, think about that!
They bring your ass some blood wrapped up in a paper sack
Wake up from this motherfucking dream
And Do what? ---] Scarface
And Stop killing the unseen

[Big Mike]
Prat got pregnant, now she is off to the bathroom
To get the baby sucked out her ass with a vacuum
Label her killer, her and the doctor thats doing it
Shouldn't had your ass out screwing, bitch
Unprotected, getting that sperm injected
Now, you wanna cry cause you're pregnant!
They need to pass the bill
To stop all these babies getting killed
PBs getting pregnant fudge thrill
But they won't stop it
Cause everybody is in it for a profit
Politicians looking at thier pockets
And this shit is sissiness
People getting whipped due this baby killing business
We need to get a grip and chill
And stop sending our unseen to the killing field

[Interlude: Scarface]
Ugh, and you know what Big Mike?
We gotta talk about.. these niggas who, you know..
Let these girls go through this shit though, right?!
You know what I'm saying?
Now, break that shit off

[Big Mike]
What's happening my nigga; what's happening my man?
I know what you're thinking, I know your motherfucking plan
Run, run, run from your motherfucking duties
Didn't want the baby but you wanted the bitch's booty

[Scarface]
Fuck her then forgot her, get her right but then you'll quit her
Told her have an abortion or you ain't getting back with her

[Big Mike]
Another baby dying, another bitch crying
Another nigga lying when he needs to be frying

[Scarface]
For going in the murder, he never meant to hurt her
But now she had the baby, all he did was desert her

[Big Mike]
Xed her out, kicked her to the curb and dumped her
Dumb motherfucker, ain't you heard of a rubber
And if not a rubber, respite the bulleting
Nigga; wake up and stop killing the unseenErse 1 (Big mike)
What it be like patna, If you be like me you be high and shit/ thankin bout the payoff and how u gone be buying shit/fliping round town fly and shit. Na,no need to lie my Nig I seen em come and go/Bunch of fools hang in round the studio/beggin for people to hear em flow/mad at me could of got they shattered dreams left on the flow.But that's the way it goes in this rap game it ain't no play thang,play thang/M.C.'s been hustling for years trying to make this hear a permanent pay thang.Na you got these ear hustlers/fake Lil busts trying to swipe yo knot/They ce IP with they crooked game trying to get they name in lights and what not.No instead of trying to write what's hot/niggas steady trying to swipe yo spot/Trying to get to keep popping why they plot in to lie in ya lot.But my homie let me tell you that's how haters is they be trying trying to get paid off yo ideas/you thenput in work for years trying to get recognition for your peers.Platinum record sales and cheers,headlining and sold out shows/Bringing I'm bundles of doe at the back if the bus talking bout what they hitting for.Spitting at the finest hoes/slammin big mansion doors/bought your mama a crib in the country at the end of some big winding road/the idea of it all is just too cold...

Chorus:Can it be it's All A Dream,Everything ain't always what it seems/Can't have no fake ass niggas on yo team/All you playas know just what I mean...

Verse 2 (Tre'mendous)

It's a Cryin' shame,lames act like they ain't heard of buying game/
In the midst of snitches sporting wired frames,I'm trying to make the money mail cause im tired of fame-

I roll incognito smoke a sweet so,we can jam a little bit of screw cause the beats slow/
Chillin with the click looking for the freaks tho,chunk up the playa duece when we creepin 4-

Deep N' peepin for the laws we blow to stay mellow, 4 sho ride,never slip and slide,we can't slip and die, we got clips inside and we eqipt to ride, fo this rap shit and where the click resides

But it ain't bout that, plus I dont doubt that these niggas gone respect the set we bout black/
We just want the checks and no doubt the clout that I earned on the lyrics on the tracks I put out flat

With no shiesty shit in the game and the playa haterism,knowin I got the real flavaism/
With them under the table calls,nigga I quit ball cause of favortism

So boy, recognise the truest, in Northline nigga's have a hardtime trying to flip a nickel to a dime so its time that we do this fool

Talkin bout cash flippin,anybody interferin catch an ass whippin, mash dippin/
Gotta keep the cash hidden from the fakes and the jakes pullin fast tricks n'

Maintain prevail, pray for a smooth sail n',get a chance to bail when they try to intervene/
They seem to be trying to take me under ,wondered whem I was younger would I punder to the fate that appeared im my dreams to me?
Or could be its all a dream[ Chorus (2X) ]
We been animals for as long as I can remember
All my niggas are pitbulls, bears and gorillas
Hard hitters, bonehard hogs for scrilla
Pimps, players, macks, drug dealers and killers

[ VERSE 1 ]
I been a animal since birth, growled when I crawled
Louisiana black bear, see the retractable claws
Gert Town-born, 9th Ward stepchild
H-Town's adopted baby, all grown, look at me now
Ferocious workin with that cat, I knock it up out the socket
Cock it, then lock it, runnin niggas worse than the Rockets
Court docus, my name on 'em, lawyer in pocket
Dismissal on false charges, I know you heard about it
Grown man business, hustle physical fitness
Holdin mo' medals than a gymnast in these ghetto olympics
I put the game into sealers, manufactured, then sell it
I get the letters, pop pellets, these haters hella jealous
Can't stand to see ( ? )
I do it for the hood, down bitches and real fellas
Bitch niggas talk like they know about us but never met us
So I put my hands around they throat like a turtleneck sweater
We in big Lac deVilles, them fuckers pushin Jettas
With no win at all but still they tryina catch up with us
We movin too fast, burnin gas, smokin on blue grass
Laughin at you fool ass as you come in last
My little homies'll blast, they loyal to a player
Get out of line, your family, your friends gon' see you later
You see, it's real talk, yeah, from a real nigga
Malt-liquor pisser, nationwide permanent fixture

[ Chorus (2X) ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
We big game with big thangs and big fame
Big names from the streets takin up both lanes
We bring pain to haters, it's a everyday thing
We catchin gorgeous dames, you niggas kissin the flame
Lames burn like oil fields up in the Middle East
We pray for warfare, fuck peace if we can't eat
But still God-fearin, the truth is what you're hearin
Champion all causes for my underprivileged children
Underground dealin, so cold I'm bone-chillin
Ready and willin, a muthafuckin ruthless villain
Down South got me, the Midwest got me
The East Coast got me, the West Coast got me
Big and black with the attitude that's so cocky
The OG's back in position and they cannot stop me
B.I.G. M.I.K.E., yes
N.A.W.L.I.N.S. P.H.A.T.S

[ Chorus (2X) ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Like a car with a broken steering column, partner, I'm hot-wired
Come let the Cayenne in my Jambalaya set you on fire
I'm a southern boy, straight out of Louisiana
My brigade is full of killers holdin them loaded hammers
I'm insane and straight bananas but still jiggin with it
Baby, show me your deal-doin, think that I won't hit the ( ? )
I'm highly x-rated, elated when I'm faded
Crossed the finsih line and waited to see if my homies made it
Congratulated all of those who had persevered
All of those who shed blood, dropped sweat and a gang of tears
Yeah, this here is ghetto evangelism
I'm tryina show you the light, endin your self-vandalism
I heard somebody say the south was slow
But I guess we ain't no mo' because we makin all that dough
I squabble harder than a bitch, yeah, Big Mizzle ain't no ho
I damn sure ain't a snitch, like Mr. Scarface, you know?

[ Chorus (2X) ][Walker M]
I'm still spitting on the mic I ordered on Amazon
But I got the game wrapped like boas and anacondas
I'm sharp as Excalibur, forged in Avalon
And compared to mine, your brain goes as slow as a grandma's Honda
My flow is candy Wonka bars, sweet and rich
Ask me if I'm keyed as shit and I'll likely try and plead the fifth
I need a bitch to tell me that we're finger lickin' good, not
KFC, but AFB is sizzlin' chicken bucket hot

[DC]
I'm never one to go and commit party fouls
I stay McFly, straight out of Marty's house
Can I do it? Yes I Ken; like I was Barbie's spouse
Trying to get brain so I obtain a smarty's mouth
Your girl's the Joker, always smiling around me
I go hard, you as soft as Downy
We're not good buds like a poor kid's brownies
If you're looking for real, then it's a good thing you found me

[Interlude]
"Pretty much everywhere, it's gonna be hot. Charlotte?"
"Man, I don't need a jacket."
"[laughs]"
"Thanks Arthur."

[Walker M]
They all say he's really fucking good at everything he fucking does
Writing 16's since before he fucking was
Since I've been getting views, I've been where the chicks are
That's right - I got a Woody while I'm building up a Buzz
Like Pixar, on that VHS
Bump me on surround sound like THX
I make that X a C, then I'm in ecstasy
And then I check to see if I can see the checks

[DC]
Got flow like the girl at Progressive
I don't give a shit like I got bad digestives
I go aggressive, like "Is his flow impressive?"
I say "No shit Sherlock, and Holmes, I'm no detective!"
You can try, but nobody is stopping me
Get money then I go, man, life is just Monopoly
Commonly copping Z's, then go smoke that broccoli
Your girl is a ho, so I'm probably pushing her off of me

[Hook]
They all say the same thing when I'm at the spot
"Pretty much everywhere, it's gonna be hot"
All the hoes need to quit the racket
"[laughs] Man, I don't need a jacket!"
Thanks Arthur x8

It's been a 8 year spread and 4 baby mamas
Still ain't found no wife, all I found was drama
Past dwellin, was it that or was it just us?
Love, was it that or was it just lust?
Fucked once, made love about a thousand times
Bought a crib, and all you could say was that the bitch was mine
Selfish thoughts, knew you was lookin for a backdo'
Think I'm kickin bullshit? I'm kickin fact, ho
Fell for a pretty face, thick hips and bitty waist
Spent my time with you and all it gave me was a shitty taste
Played a game of chase from my town to yo hood
Runnin back and forward thinkin it was all good
I shoulda left you there, pretty face and sandy hair
Gave you the world and couldn't recognize a man that cared
Dick sucks with intentions just to get me sprung
Was it a game when you laid there swallowed my cum?
I was something dumb thinkin you were there for me
Played the game with both of my hands and never cared for me
But everybody plays the fool once or twice
All it did was make me stronger, bitch, ain't nothin nice

[Chorus]
	It's better that I find out now, rather than later
	It's better that I make a clean break with all my paper
	It's better that I find another chick to take your place
	It's best that you get your bitch-ass up out my face

{MC Breed:}
Met her when she was 19, brand-new
And she only went out in tight jeans, and could dance too
Burgers and fries, bout 30 lives, told to her
Game, sold to her, plus everybody knew her
What the business? Except I got kids for a witness
And you let her make a come-up like survival of the fittest
You a sucker for a pretty face, smile and a pussy
You a clown runnin round actin wild like a rookie
I know you know she got somebody else on the side
Came through with you while she was rollin in his ride
You know the rules, your bitch chose him, now keep your cool
A sucker for pleasure is just a full-grown fool
Now tell the truth, she's somethin you see walk around - woof
Had you done swooped and went and bought her ass a coupe
Just a nigga with a brown nose, the town knows
Still come around swear he clown those
It's better that you find out

[Chorus]

{Devin:}
I wish I woulda known you was a crazy bitch
Before goin over to your house and layin some dick
I thought it wasn't nothin but a mutual nut
We fuck, I get mine, you get yours, we get up
But before I can get to my crib you hit my hip
Still ready to fuck with the smell of dick on your lips
I started thinkin with my dickhead, man, that big red
Pushy-ass pussy, it's big and it's bushy
Couldn't help but to backdo' that ass again and again
Nut after nut, shit was cool, but then, you look, friends
Started dippin, trippin and callin my house
With my gal sittin by me lookin all in my mouth
I say: "Hey!", and cough, but she know I'm tryina play it off
"What's up, nigga? - Bitch, when I see ya I'ma kill ya!"
It's better that I find another freak to take your place
One who won't have me dealin with a domestic case

[Chorus][Verse 1]
I ain't trippin off these niggas flippin, losin they mind
Gettin high, chasin hoes, I was like that at one time
I did my thing, and still on top of my game
Got niggas askin: Big Mike, when you gon' be droppin again?
I just smile, go back the to lab, work on my style, collect beats
Cook it up like a ki, and take it back to the streets
Cause niggas beef when I don't speak, like they straight missin somethin
I give em a tape, they be like 'great', pop it in they deck and start bumpin
Got em humpin like the Gap Band, I'm back, man, look here
Doin shows straight in all 50 states within one year
I got tight gear for the stage, blow up and make front page
Now it's happenin, I'm platinum with tracks my nigga Mike B. laid
Made niggas mad, then I step, got a new click
Now I'm ready to do shit, '97 new shit
Keep on talkin, son, and I'ma keep on stackin
I'm real with this shit while you niggas are out there actin

[Chorus]
Playa, playa, make the hoes say, dollar, dollar
'Burbans and Impalas, makin niggas holler
When they recognize a Louisiana nigga straight comin Texas side

[Verse 2]
Hey what's that nigga's name?
It's the Peterman, ain't no shame in his game
Playa, playa, make the hoes say, dollar, dollar
'Burbans and Impalas, makin niggas holler
When they recognize a Louisiana nigga straight comin Texas side
Surprise, who's catchin a eye like the ufo
This ain't the mothership, I don't return shit that you left, ho
Ask her, though, I max the ho, bags the flow
Ass to toe, hoes I hit, I let you know
I'm the original, there's no second, yo
Because a nigga's kinda special, loc
Seriously speakin weekend after weekend
A nigga like me got the hoes seriously tweakin
Freakin at night, I cracks it like Whodini
Had a bitch named Jeannie
Made her act bad for my brother Peanie

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's the bigger, the blacker, the nigga comin from that swamp
About to smoke a quarter for starters, so pass that blunt
Don't stunt, what you want, niggas, what?
School em with some of that buddah
Cos Kooley keep fuckin with them bustas
And don't give a fuck, so what you wanna make of it?
Totin on that swisher, I know you wanna hit it, come have your take of it
Fakin it, never, nigga cos I'm way too real for that
Rollin with a gang of niggas ready to kill for that
Green shit, which we smoke from Houston to New Orleans, bitch
Take a hit and quit, and now I got you seein shit
So pass it to my nigga, my nigga pass it back to me
Take it to the head, and that's the last of it
You see me in the back with my hoes ridin on that gold
High till I die and that's the way it go, oh
You know, I see you bitches after the show

I dont give a fuck about a pussy ass bitch
Makin' dead bodies just because 2 low is poppin' clips
So watch me cock the Glock and make sure your ass is through
And bust these motherfuckers like my nigga DMG do

[Scarface]
Mister mister Scarface, Im coming with that bomb shit
Fuck the dumb shit, here here here i come bitch
Scratching shit on the motherfuckin' atmos
And if you wanna big piece then move on up close

Knockin' dicks in the dirt with just this one finger

[Hook]

[Big Mike]

[Big Mike]
So recognize real, niggas when we comin' through

[Hook]

[007]
Bitch, you get your neck gone fuckin' with the bloody one
Thinking off mister nice guy, you thinking about another one
Double O Seven fool, coming with that new thang

Niggas are getting their ass kicked fucking with the 5th ward
Blasting on your hood, like a motherfucking hit squad

Buck em down, buck em down, on your ass motherfucker

[E-Rock]
I got you hoes buck on us, bitch i gotsta get my blast on
Seventeen shots, take one and pass it on
Buck em, buck em, buck em down
Peeling caps, sending dicks to the dirt
Leaving them in a park, leaving them hoes floating in a bloodpath
I gives a fuck, nigga squeezing to your last drop
And check the infrared beam from my nine Glock
And feel my cannons in this slaught, got the slug bitch
I wanna see your blood oozing from them fresh wounds
And feel the fire, it blaze hot, motherfucker
And bite the bullet 'till your motherfuckin knees buckle
Round from round clip for club bitch, i kill with it

[Hook]

[DMG]
Boom, buck em down, buck em down, buck em down
Coming for a blast, motherfuckers laying down
I bet you never thought, you never run up on the murder
Especially the one that got you smoked by the burner
I biggy boss, sneaky 'nough shots, call the doc
Cause im about to hurt a motherfucker on the block
Cause check it DMG ain't a motherfucking punk
As the plumb before the motherfucker running from the trunk
I biggy blast, biggy bang bang to your skull
Watch you fall to the street, motherfuckin dead meat
Then i continue busting 'till i can't bust another shot
Shit, make a dash to the coupe then i dip/
????????? grab another gat
Settle to them ready after that catch a cab back
Murder in the first, plead me guilty but i still bust
Taking care of business on these niggas who done fucked up
How the fuck you figure you go make it with your cap peel
Facin' mad skills, buck em' down on the real deal
Homicidal maniac shooting fatal tactics
Clown on the down and get your wig split around
I buck em down

[Hook: till fade](Verse 1)
I ain't trippin off these niggas flippin, losin they mind
Gettin high, chasin hoes, I was like that at one time
I did my thing, and still on top of my game
Got niggas askin: Big Mike, when you gon' be droppin again?
I just smile, go back the to lab, work on my style, collect beats
Cook it up like a ki, and take it back to the streets
Cause niggas beef when I don't speak, like they straight missin somethin
I give em a tape, they be like 'great', pop it in they deck and start bumpin
Got em humpin like the Gap Band, I'm back, man, look here
Doin shows straight in all 50 states within one year
I got tight gear for the stage, blow up and make front page
Now it's happenin, I'm platinum with tracks my nigga Mike B. laid
Made niggas mad, then I step, got a new click
Now I'm ready to do shit, '97 new shit
Keep on talkin, son, and I'ma keep on stackin
I'm real with this shit while you niggas are out there actin

(Chorus)
Playa, playa, make the hoes say, dollar, dollar
'Burbans and Impalas, makin niggas holler
When they recognize a Louisiana nigga straight comin Texas side

(Verse 2)
Hey what's that nigga's name?
It's the Peterman, ain't no shame in his game
Playa, playa, make the hoes say, dollar, dollar
'Burbans and Impalas, makin niggas holler
When they recognize a Louisiana nigga straight comin Texas side
Surprise, who's catchin a eye like the ufo
This ain't the mothership, I don't return shit that you left, ho
Ask her, though, I max the ho, bags the flow
Ass to toe, hoes I hit, I let you know
I'm the original, there's no second, yo
Because a nigga's kinda special, loc
Seriously speakin weekend after weekend
A nigga like me got the hoes seriously tweakin
Freakin at night, I cracks it like Whodini
Had a bitch named Jeannie
Made her act bad for my brother Peanie

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
It's the bigger, the blacker, the nigga comin from that swamp
About to smoke a quarter for starters, so pass that blunt
Don't stunt, what you want, niggas, what?
School em with some of that buddah
Cos Kooley keep fuckin with them bustas
And don't give a fuck, so what you wanna make of it?
Totin on that swisher, I know you wanna hit it, come have your take of it
Fakin it, never, nigga cos I'm way too real for that
Rollin with a gang of niggas ready to kill for that
Green shit, which we smoke from Houston to New Orleans, bitch
Take a hit and quit, and now I got you seein shit
So pass it to my nigga, my nigga pass it back to me
Take it to the head, and that's the last of it
You see me in the back with my hoes ridin on that gold
High till I die and that's the way it go, oh
You know, I see you bitches after the show

(Chorus)
(CeCe:)
(I need it

? )

[ VERSE 1: Big Mike ]
And it don't stop, so keep it goin
1994 and the bitches still hoein
Niggas still slingin that shit on the side
Make the wrong move, you might go for a ride
All my niggas in the hood still got game
And it goes to show ya, ain't a damn thang changed
Nigga, huh, you wanna claim that you OG
But you ain't original if you don't wanna see the GB
Climb to the top of thangs
Clock a big fat grip and break off the proper thangs
Hoes in the neighborhood
Be all on the dick cause they know that the flavor's good
And like I told you befo', on the one it don't stop
My nigga got a brand new drop
So when you thinkin about steppin up you better step strong
Cause you know it's gon' be on
When you're dealin with the

[ VERSE 2: Big Mike ]
A-one-two, you know I gots ta
Three-fo', break you off proper
Like soap cause you know we rollin
So hey ho, come and get your foldin
Yeah, for the number one nigga out the south
Fadin all you niggas runnin off at the motherfuckin mouth
Just like a faucet
So drop those Girbauds, hoes, and let me toss it
And recognize a real nigga when you see one
(There's somethin about them Mikes - everybody wanna be one)
I'm tryina give your ass the deal
You think you got a down-ass nigga, bitch, you better get with the real
Cause you know we like to handle those
Like Monique in South Central, straight up skanless hoes
Huh, I had to move that ho
Let my muddy water ( ? ) that ho
It's the

[ VERSE 3: Big Mike ]
I done put it down, nigga, now what the fuck you gon' do for me
I guess I'm just another nigga that you see
Doin bad, so you shovelin me to the wayside
There ain't no love in this town, that's why I stay high
Full of that shit, cause I really don't give a fuck
I'm doin bad right now, livin on nigga luck
Dreamin of bigger bucks but it ain't comin to me
And you want me to believe that shit that you runnin to me?
About you down, we be down, nigga fuck that
Until I gets mine you gets no love back
Cause I am what I am, man
I made a come-up, ain't nobody gave me a damn thang
It's theHey, this shit is somethin serious, boy
Check it out

[Chorus]
Creepin and rollin, you know what time it is
Oh yeah, a brother has gotta get down for his

[Verse 1]
What's happenin, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my man?
Once again I know what you're thinkin, once again I know what your plan
Is, been playa-hatin a nigga like me for years
But now I'm changin gears
Fixin to move on, fixin to buy a brand-new home
Polishin up my chrome
For your ass cause I'm back up on the block
1994 and I ain't sellin no more rocks
Back with a sack and niggas know I pack
A Glock, so stop before I put you on your back
Down with S-A, the place where the best play
Best pray if your chest ain't where your vest lay
Southside rollin wide-sized
Bitches say we high-side because we pass by
You don't speak, but she's just another freak
Cause I know my nigga been fuckin her for weeks
And I rather not waste my time, I just mash out
Blowin big smoke in the glasshouse
Two deep, me and my nigga O.D
Smokin swisher sweets comin up on Scott Street

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I deal with the five S's before every Monday
Shit, shower and shave, and serve on Sundays
And it's funny how these hoes be jockin ours
Because I'm rollin in a candy-blue glasshouse
Gold Shoes on my ho
Thinkin about committin suicide cause she got fo' do's
And brand-new Vogues
And a trunk full of amps to hurt em at the soundshow
Breakin em off a proper piece
And the shit won't stop until the jockin cease
So follow me as I creep with my niggas on a flip
My cup overrunneth, so come and take a sip

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now I got you interested
And everybody wanna see the man, the Peterman
Little kids wanna be the man
And grow up and fuck hoes
And rock shows, ride Vo's, and slam mansion do's
Nigga, cause it's like that
Growin up on flat, havin dreams of livin fat
And I can't do it no other way
Doin it the southern way
So fuck what another say
G to the e to the to to the o
To the B to the o to the y to the s's
Houston, Texas where niggas get restless
And wreckless, no easy access, don't test us
Nigga, recognize where the best is
Fool

Creepin, rollin, you know what time it is
Clownin and strollin, gotta get down for his

[Chorus]

Oh yeah
Doin this thing like this
Roll em up
Palms up in the air
Yeah, that's right
Let the sun hit it
Back for it like this, you know
Cause they thought I wasn't comin back
Still doin the same thing
Yeah
Creepin, rollin
You know what time it is
I'm just
Clownin, strollin
You know
