[Produced by Sir Jinx]

Fuck All Ya'll

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight Bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stomping
While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the Whites, one big house
And not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? (Who ya fooling!)
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my Mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ay yo Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you Benedict
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and ya'll disgrace the C-P-T
Cause you're getting fucked out your green by a White boy
With no vaseline

[Hook]
Now you're getting done without vaseline (3x)
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls
Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
Cause he's going out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, cause I remember when you drove a B-210
Broke as a mothafucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green, oh yeah
The Villain does get fucked with no vaseline

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
And I'll think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fucking your homeboys
You little maggot; Eazy E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree
With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light em up, burn em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a White Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk, too
Trying to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright, punk always into something, getting fucked at night
By Mista Shitpacker
Bend over for the goddamn cracker, no vaseline(blends into intro with dialogue from Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing)

"Twenty D Energizers."
"Twenty, C Energizer?"
"D, not C, D."
"B Energizer?"
"D motherfucker, D! Learn to speak english first, alright? D!"
"How many you say?"
"Twenty, motherfucker, twenty."
"Honey..."
"Mother-fuck you!"

[Ice Cube]
Everytime I wanna go get a fuckin brew
I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one-penny countin motherfuckers
That make a nigga made enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but bitch, I got a job
"Look you little Chinese motherfucker
I ain't tryin to steal none of yo' shit, leave me alone!"
"Mother-fuck you!"
Yo yo, check it out
So don't follow me, up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of the nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the black fist
Or we'll burn your store, right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya!
Cause you can't turn the ghetto - into Black Korea

"I do fuck you!"[Verse One]
God damn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay
Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get peeled
Cause "The Nigga Ya Love to hate" still can "Kill at Will"
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack SWING on my nuts
Down wit the niggas that I bail out
I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out
"Fuck you, Ice Cube!", that's what the people say
Fuck AmeriKKKa, still with the triple K
Cause you know when my nine goes buck
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from 12 stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Make sure before you buck wit duck quick
Punk, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with

"I'ma let y'all know one thing man.."

[Verse Two]
Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin L.M
It's the number one crew in the area
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work
Cause Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin fools up with the big ass L
One time can't hold me back
Sweatshirt, khakis and crokersacs
Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
Cause Al Davis never paid us
I hope he wear a vest
It's all about the L-E-N-C-H y'all know the rest
Motherfuckin' crew, motherfuckin' mob
Do a motherfuckin' job in a motherfuckin' squad
In '91 Ice Cube grew stronger and bigger
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with

"One-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and.."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute"

[Cube] Drop a old school beat!

[Verse Three]
Like I said, it's a brand new payback
Now in '91, let's see whose beats get jacked!
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
(Keep the wack beats out)
True motherfuckin' baller
And hoes can't roll on
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta "Hold On"
Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass til I'm smellin shit
Off wit the head, off wit the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin'
Run around like a chicken
Grand Dragon finger lickin'
Yo, turn him over wit a spatula
Now we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
Pig, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with!

"Last person in the world you wanna fuck with.." (repeat 3X)[Ay, yeah you, motherfucker
You know who I'm talking to
Yeah, you that motherfucker that betrayed your homeboys and you ain't
Shit
Yeah, you about to get your motherfucking ghetto pass revoked
Motherfucker
Punk-ass mark, bitch-made
Punk-ass trick in a basket
You got caught up in the mix...]

[Verse 1]
It's the nigga ya love to hate with a new song
So what really goes on
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
Cause I can't move to the snow
Cause soon as y'all get some dough
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
"Nigger go home" spray-painted on your house
Trying to be White or a Jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being an Uncle Tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names, you know who you are
You little punk, be true to the game

BREAK
[Yeah, motherfucker
Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh?
Yeah, get a little money and moves out the neighborhood and shit
But you still ain't shit...]

[Verse 2]
When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On MTV but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
You out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop selling out your race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'm a be brief
Be true to the game

BREAK
[Yeah motherfucker
I see you got your fancy cars and shit
But you know what?
You still ain't shit
That's right, I caught you slipping
You know I could've gat you
Yeah, but I didn't even trip...]

[Verse 3]
A message to the oreo cookie
Find a mirror and take a look, G
Do you like what you see?
But you're quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You don't associate with the Negroes
You wanna be just like Jack
But Jack is calling you a nigger behind your back
So back off genius
I don't need you to correct my broken English
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?
With your black ass
Mister Big
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame
Get a grip, oreo and be true to the game

[And Ice Cube practices what he preaches
He continues to live in South Central Los Angeles
And he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood...]

Be true to the game![Verse 1]
Could you tell me who released our animal instinct?
And the white man sittin' there tickled pink
Laughin' at us on the avenue
Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew
We can't enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous... at each other's wealth
Commin' up is just in me
But the Black community is full of envy
Too much back-stabbin'
While I look out the window I see all the Japs grabbin'
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood
Build a store, and sell their goods
To the county recips
You know, us po niggas; nappy hair and big lips?
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out?
We ain't nothin' but porchmonkeys
To the average bigot, redneck honky
You say comin' up is a must
But before we can come up, take a look at US

[Verse 2]
And all y'all dope-dealers...
You're as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin' dope
But you ain't built us a supermarket
So when can spend our money with the blacks
Too busy buyin' gold an' Cadillacs
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'
Exploitin' us like the Caucasians did
For 400 years - I got 400 tears- for 400 peers
Died last year from gang-related crimes
That's why I got gang-related rhymes
But when I do a show ta kick some facts
Us Blacks don't know how ta act
Sometimes I believe the hype, man
We mess it up ourselves and blame the white man
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice
No Ice Cube, just Vanilla Ice
And yall sit and scream and cuss
But there's no one ta blame- but US

[Verse 3]
US ... will always sing the blues
Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
And if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
"Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'"
Just like a beast
But I'm the first nigga ta holler out {PEACE, BLACK MAN}
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's
Bet my money on the dice and the horses
Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus
They used to call me Negro
After all this time I'm still bustin up the chiffarobe
No respect and ignored
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford
In jail cause I can't pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of US, but yall think it's dumb of me
To hold a mirror to ya face, but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about...[Female News Reporter]
"At the bottom of our news tonight, there's been a new animal aimed at falling off the face of our Earth. Yes
Young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the Endangered
Species List. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the blacks. When asked why, a top top law
Official adds, 'Because they make good game'"

(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

[Ice Cube]
Peace!? - don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figgure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue!
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder!
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy!
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...

[Chuck D] All of us are endangered, DAMN!
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

[Ice Cube]

You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
Cuz we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
It was plain and simple
The 9mm went (gunshot sound) to the temple
(gunshot sound) (gunshot sound) was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can, yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute!
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck!
Thinkin' about the payback
Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'
The shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside...

[Sampled guitar riff]
[Chuck D]
Standing in the middle of war
In the middle we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
Ebony can't see to the lightside
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin’ from the corner
Same applies with a Ph.D
Who's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin’
Who the fuck are they foolin’?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin’ brown
That's a fact
Got a fear of the bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yet Cube, they can't fuck with the
Darkside!"And now, the wonderous world of.."
"Hey, come to Los Angeles!
You and your family can have peace and tranquility
Enjoy the refinement.."
"Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?"
"Hello, my name is Elaine --
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles"

[Ice Cube]
How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove comparment
Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive

"Hi this is Elaine again
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles
Or is somebody taking your things? Have you witneesed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again."
"This is Los Angeles." "This is Los Angeles."

[Ice Cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
Cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
Cause most niggas get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho
And you won't survive in South Central

"Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
Punk motherfucker!"

And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!

[Ice Cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggas are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a price
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
Cause South Central L.A., is one big germ
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin key's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central

Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass
You tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out
And for you so called baller-ass niggas
You know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit
You'll sho' get got, just like that
This ain't no joke motherfuckers
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer
Puttin his two cents in..

"This is Los Angeles."[Kool G. Rap]
The last time I caught a body it was recent
Gimme a HK, four banana clips, and I'll take on a precinct
Yeah, the murder rate is on the rise, with niggas like me
Steady poppin, niggas are droppin like flies
To get em up when I hit em I hit em hard, there'll be no get well card
Niggas straight to the motherfuckin graveyard
Cause me no wanna get undone
Me pickin the one and lickin em up and hit em up for fun
He thought them bullet hit me but him didn't get none
You better run son, because me beginnin to get the gun
Yo, murder me, you musta heard of me
And if you get rushed to emergency, I'm shootin niggas in surgery
Another nigga life is took
I'll be at your wake motherfucker signin my name on that book
Inside the morgue another body freezes
It's one more bitch nigga that was sent to meet Jesus
"Come on down!" "Whassup nigga?"
No ambulence, just paramedics scrapin your brains off the street
So yeah motherfucker come get a taste
Cause I'mma give your punk ass my two in face and beat the case
My finger's on the trigger, I'mma pull it
So now you know that Kool G Rap is number one with a bullet

[Big Daddy Kane]
A one man gang to bring the bang
So the next nigga can't even hang, yang yang yang yang
You know my style, and know my pedigree
You can ask Sadaam Hussein about me
I'm never to let a brother bass
And if you bring on a crew, I hope the bitches saw Scarface
Cause I'mma send em to the morgue
Six feet under, gettin their mail from the groundhog
Cause I'm the wrong brother to push
When put to the test, I go to war like George Bush
And I got apartments to give
The landlord of the morgue, now who need a place to live?
I'm rough and tough, the man on the scene
The baddest the maddest, you know the routine
I flip and rip, to set the rank
The coolest in rulin the gangsta lean
I got my gat to your dome and I'mma pull it
I'm number motherfuckin one with a bullet

[Kool G. Rap]
Niggas are wavin white flags, then dragged
In a hospital bed, full of lead, with a shit bag
You get a slug in your mug
Just give him a kiss and a hug, I pull the mother, "flatline"
I'm fuckin him up I'm buckin him up all properly
No poppin me is stoppin me even if he go look out for me
I'm quicker to flicker the nigga the trigger is the plan for me
You try to run me comin to kill the whole family
Cause in the city there's no pity or no sympathy
You gotta hem em up, and now you're just a memory
Yeah nigga, I leave em done when I hit em
When pussy comes to get em, tell em Kool G Rap did em
With my fingers on the trigger I'm Terminatin like umm..
(Who Schwarzenegger?) Yeah that nigga!
So fuck all the bullshit
You know a nigga's number one with a bulletIntro: WC

Yeah, ain't nothing changed, know what I'm saying?
Still the same old same old, W.C. still in effect
Yo, break it down Jinx

Verse One: WC

Damn, suckers got me picking up my pen again
Swinging on my jock like Tarzan
Looking for a change, hoping my head swoll
Thinking I'm rich cause I made a little video
Shaking my hand, yeah right, now I'm a cool brother
But as soon as I step off, you're calling me a sucker
Mad, because I bust a Benz on Lorenzos
Hanging on the boulevard fronting on the flow show
You know it's funny when you start making money
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry want to be your buddy
The same ones that dissed ya, now it's a list of
First to riff, now they all on your dick, yo
I'm looking at you laughing, popping your lip
Ripping my zipper onstage, can pay the bail with a limp
Y'all don't want to give it up to me now that I'm getting pumped
Run around like Calamine, the same old Dub
Do I know where I come from, who's my friends?
Who's responsible for this little spot that I'm in?
Yo, I see them all playing in my car when I drive by
Telling all my homies "Yo, he ain't that fly"
The beat just cause I made a record the record
So please don't make me better than the next man, erase that gameplan
Cause I'm still down to bust a cap then backslap
Those who pop rap at the mouth like Ex-Lax
And those who wanna test me, step right up, bro
My number's the same, oh by the way, it's in the ghetto
I'm sorry that I can't flaunt the fortune and fame
But when it comes to the Dub (Ain't a damn thing changed)

Verse Two: Coolio

Ain't a damn thing changed, sucker, how could ya figure?
Coolio and Crazy Toons will never sell out, nigga
Sporting khakis and T-shirts, beanies and Starter caps
And land funky raps on the dop tracks
Should I dance on it for a couple of dollars?
Or sell away my soul to put a rope on my collar?
I was taken from the missed of the lost and missing
Rapping on dark road on my way to prison
Stuck me in the studio, put me on the radio
Told me to perpetrate like I was a hero
I ain't with that, Toons got my back
Do I have to use a gat to show you where I'm at?
Or pose with a forty ounce and fake like a killer
With a long black Cack like a small-time dope dealer
Diamonds on my finger and women at my feet
A house that I don't own and no respect on the street
Might be detained, cause I ain't trying
Let me explain, when it comes to Coolio (Ain't a damn thing changed)

Verse Three: WC

Whoever said living in the spotlight is simple as one, two, three
Ha, they must have been sipping on a ?Twizzeline?
Cause man I ain't used to this unusual behavior
Who wants a friendly neighbor?
Girls way back that told me to go to hell
Is sitting backstage, want to go to the motel
MC's that pretending that they was down from the giddy up
Trying to call you by your first name and stuff
Yo, and all these fake promoters stepping to the Circle
Remember how you treated us 12 months ago?
Yo, you didn't know bro, now you want a show
Toons tell 'em what's up (Give it up sucker duck)
Yeah, remember that the capital W told ya
Suckers don't fade me, popping hogging my jock
I keep to myself and I step with the pep
The lyrics of death, tell me how it sounds, G (Cool)
Waord, since I have to prove that I'm the same
And still remain dropping dogs in this rap game
To make it all simple and plain
Well let me put it like this: (Ain't a damn thing changed)[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Now take my bitch, she won't complain about shit
Because she's my ho, she don't belong to a trick
So when you fuck her, and give her all your cash
I get paid, or put my foot in your ass
I won't marry the bitch, and give her half
I get more head, and then I laugh at the one bitch shit
I got a gang of hoes, I get, freak, ass, lick, these balls and toes

[Ice Cube]
Now stupid little bitches get tossed
If they don't realize I'm the motherfucking boss
Come on down and get your ass pinched
And if you talk shit get your ass lynched
Cause I'm the B the I the T the C the H
The K the I the L the L the A
Ice Cube, a nigga that's bigga than a nut
Cause a bitch is a bitch is a ho is a slut

[Hook: Too $hort]
You say how can I call a women a bitch
It ain't nothing but a word like shit
Ain't no slipping in my motherfucking pimping
And all bitches ain't women
You come home and get smooth cussed out
You gotta a bitch with a foul-ass mouth
Scared to tripp her with a left hook
You'z a bitch in my book, bitch

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
My nigga Jinx made the mix
So punk-ass motherfucking bitches get the 86
I keep hoes on five, cause I'm fucking more pussy than the law allow
With my boy Too $hort, see he quick to grab a bitch by the throat
And slam her ass, cram her ass with a fat dick, cause she's a trick bitch

[Too $hort]
I like fat bitches, and I like 'em slim
I'll take a fat bitch, and stick my dick right in
Her big fat ass, she'll make me cum again
I'm mack daddy bitch, fuck her friend
I saw your homegirl, she said whats up with us
I said nothing, fucked her on a tour bus
She got it good too, dicked down on the floor
The bitch was fine, but the pussy ain't good as yours

[Ice Cube]
She a straggler, struggler, straight salome smuggler
Everytime I see the bitch, she's looking uglier
And if you got a trick-ass on your left, sitting there with dick on her breath
Last night she sucked my dick, now she's kissing little man
Won't he suck my dick and let's cut out the middle man
And if you have never heard of me, you's a bitch
It ain't but a word to me

[Hook]
I'll stop calling ya, beeyotch

[Too $hort]
Man Fuck these hoes man, ya know
Nappy ass bitch ass tramp ass slutty ass ho

Female voice:
I'll stop calling ya, Beyotch(echo)

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
I go hard on a bitch, fuck respect for ya men
I get my way with a bitch, when I act like a pimp
Always carrying bank, but I fooled the bitch
Cause all she ever got was to drool on my dick
Ice Cube will slap a ho for the fuck of it
Just like me and that's some real shit
Bitch got bold with her loud ass mouth
Tough ass bitch got knocked out
You know a bitch ain't nothing but a word to me
Some of you punks are just scared to see
If you could call that bitch a bitch you would
And if you can't, you probably should
I'm spitting game to you mark ass lames
On how how to get a bitch and treat the bitch like shit
You can't buy love, all pimps know that
It's all about the way old Short Dogg macks
Don't hold the bitch hand or walk side by side
Go first class everytime you fly
She'll go Greyhound, and just meet you there
I'm just an ice cold hard ass Oakland player
You want to tongue kiss bitch, it figures
I introduce you to my homeboy Richard
Also known by his nickname Dick, now let's tongue kiss bitch

[Ice Cube]
I like big butts, so let it be known to the public
I bust a rap or two and the bitches love it
I'm only out for one thing so hate me, I ain't the one so don't try to fade me
I don't wear too much gold cause it's tacky
I bust a Raider hat t-shirt and khakis
See a lot of hoes in freaky clothes everyday
So I talk to 'em in any ol can I way
See a bitch need a nigga to coach 'em
So I grab my dick and smoothly approach 'em
I say hi, and I'm really kind of pitched
If they ignore me then I say yo freak bitch
Give up the number hardly, we'll have a slumber party
You see I'll fuck you to death and then I'll dump the body
Cause I'm a nigga that's bigger than crew or a gang
And when it comes to bitches I'm out for only one thang
Yo, bitch ain't nothing but a word to me, $hort(blends into intro with dialogue from Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing)

"Twenty D Energizers."
"Twenty, C Energizer?"
"D, not C, D."
"B Energizer?"
"D motherfucker, D! Learn to speak english first, alright? D!"
"How many you say?"
"Twenty, motherfucker, twenty."
"Honey..."
"Mother-fuck you!"

[Ice Cube]
Everytime I wanna go get a fuckin brew
I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one-penny countin motherfuckers
That make a nigga made enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but bitch, I got a job
"Look you little Chinese motherfucker
I ain't tryin to steal none of yo' shit, leave me alone!"
"Mother-fuck you!"
Yo yo, check it out
So don't follow me, up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of the nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the black fist
Or we'll burn your store, right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya!
Cause you can't turn the ghetto - into Black Korea

"I do fuck you!"[Produced by Sir Jinx & Xzibit]

[Verse 1]
The official representative, LAC
This is prophecy manifested by X to the Z
Victory, strike a B-Boy stance in khaki pants
Never get along like red and black ants, advance
When you're staring at this concrete that move like liquid
Like a nigga without legs, I ain't trying to kick it
Too much to finish, a menace, without enough time
My mind only give punchline, you probably thinking of the wrong kind
Cause if it jokes, nigga know
The kind that drop on your eyes, your ears, your nose, and your throat
I promote self-defense. not dollars and sense
Kick it with scholars and pimps, you just the last part over the fence
Assed out in the open, while you was hoping that Xzibit was second rate
But I refuse to make just another record in the crate
I think not, got bee-bops
I bring it to your house like Pink Dot

[Interlude]
"Today we are on the streets of South Central Los Angelos, a fight for
Survival"
"We have people that are conditioned not to expect to live past age thirty
They no longer. Once they no longer care they're extremely dangerous."

[Verse 2]
Stand at attention, make sure you keep your piece clean
When I release steam, police crime scenes to guillotines
Hit and decapitate the bird case, featherweight
Critical thinking, while you add water to concentrate
Xzibit crash the gate, heavyweight, box 'em in
Seal off the exits, then cut off your Oxygen
Xzibit run with a regiment of veterans
I only like to come out late night, like Dave Letterman
Time for some medicine, cause niggas bout to get sick
Calling me a hater cause I don't ride dicks
Read my lips, we got problems like Bloods and Crips
Love the sound of clips when I load my shit
Chamber Music, this is for the ones with stone-face
That catch you at the right time in the wrong place
We unsafe, One-fifty-one with no chase and no ice
Take away your life like three strikes
Yeah, come on, Chamber Music

[Verse 3]
So now Xzibit got a little money, I think it's funny
How motherfuckers think I'm supposed to share like Sonny
Clarify, you don't work you don't eat, I repeat
You don't eat you get weak, catch a fragile physique
Accomplish more in one day than you can do in a week
The X-Man, Wolverine, one swing to make the cut clean
End of all things manifested in flesh
Fuck the game, I take the test, graduate, pass to the S-Class
Catch a roadrash, all you smell is hash
Chronic mix, bumping the Liks
Addicting like a Heron fix
Bear-arm from here to a hundred-twenty meters
Get black-balled, modern day Lee Harvey Oswald
The assassin, brother who came blastin'
Take it without askin', rappers is all fashion
Xzibit keep mashing through
Got any lost words? I got two
Try "fuck" and "you", like that[Ice Cube]
Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test
With four brothers in the SS
I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin' in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin', I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me?
Or do they got love?
So when the light turns green, I don't bone out
I wanna see what these black men are all about
Cuz if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride...
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin out the one smokin' indo
Comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, cuz I'm color blind

[Threat]
Killa Cali, the state where they kill
Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong word
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
Cuz I slang these thangs like a G
It's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind

[KAM]
I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color, or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side
And you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now, I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
Cuz brothas, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down
I'm colorblind

[WC]
Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, Young and dumb and full of cum, I’m a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

[Coolio]
Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin'
Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'
Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side

[WC]
Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip

[Coolio]
So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross

[WC]
Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side

[Coolio]
I ain't contributin to genocide (why?)
Cause I'm colorblind

[King Tee]
Niggas in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned.
Baby Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together and we color 'em dead
Dead, dyin, gettin smoked's like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

[J-Dee (Lench Mob)]
I understand how all my homeboys feel
Cuz I been shot; to this day, I pack my steel
Cuz I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep
Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind[intro]
The umm, security we have here today
Not the OPEN security
The ones, that that really sitting there
And really think, we don't know who they are!

"Now that's funky" (4x)

[Verse 1: Kool G. Rap]
Crime don't pay, that's what they tell us
But that's because the other motherfuckers getting jealous
But I'm a tell you this, they neighborhood got the Goodfellas
But they come arrest us for the same shit they sell us
Cause they don't want to see a young black nigga rollin'
Inside a nice car, nice kit, without the shit being stolen
So they come and lock a nigga up
Meanwhile some corrupt, politician nigga is making bigger bucks
Niggas getting blamed for the crystals
But we don't grow the motherfucking coke or weed or make the fucking pistols
Niggas ain't trying to live in poverty
And a black man's lottery's a motherfucking robbery
So yo you gotta make your best
Make a small investment and then put it to the test
Yes, cause the other motherfuckers getting over
Police don't look at a white man strange driving a Range Rover
Carrying shit like it's minerals
The big dollar white dollar suit and tie criminals
Even the government figures
Selling shit to the motherfucking Columbians and rich niggas
Crime isn't time from the brothers
Hey you say it don't pay, it's paying white motherfuckers
It all depends on how you do your shit
Cause you can learn it quick intelligent and that's it! You're well fit!
Fuck workin for a bastard
I got to see that money before my ass sees a casket
Get paid, motherfuck a raise
Cause to all them improper crooked coppers, crime pays

[Chorus]
"Jack you motherfuckers" (2x)
"Wake up and go for what you know.."
"Everyone's got to make a living"
"Boy I'm trying to make me some.. MONEY!!"

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
Stop, nigga stop, nigga freeze
But at the same time some old rich fuck is driving by with twenty ki's
Because they came up with a law
To keep the rich motherfuckers rich and the poor motherfuckers poor
We take the cake you get the crumbs
Stacking up a package of cracks to sell to blacks in the slums
Guns are being sold over the counter
And you wonder why your daughter's head was slaughtered when they found her
Why did he have to shoot the bitch
But the bitch, I mean the witch, just had to switch
To make the nigga Richie Rich
Yeah, so I'm throwing you the phrase
Believe me when I tell you motherfucking crime pays[Verse 1]
I'm on the verge of commitin murder
My girl is gettin on my last nerve and I don't wanna hurt her
She wants me to get a job
I get harassed cause I'm laying on my ass like a big slob
But everywhere I go, I get rejected
They won't hire a motherfucker with a jail record
So the least I could do, is look presentable
But I'm labelled by the city as a criminal
They won't give me no slack, Jack
And I got one strike against me already because my skin is black
See I'm irrelevant to Help Wanted signs
And they wonder why niggas commit crimes
My girl pays the rent gas and light
Goes to class at days and works at night
I'm trying to get some money I can hand to her
But I ain't with bein a motherfuckin janitor
Plus I got my little nigga
And I'm tryin my best to be the right kind of father figure
But my hands is startin to shake
I'm tryin to hold my head because I'm reachin for the thirty-eight
I pick it up, man fuckit
I gotta go out and hit the street and get some ducats
Lookin for somethin to hit
I throw on my hood, cause I'm about to do some stupid shit
I step in the Seven-Eleven
Come fast with the cash or get your ass sent to heaven
He musta' hit the alarm, cause I'm perspirin
Cause now I'm hearin motherfuckin sirens
I tried to run out, three thousand decent
Next thing I know, I'm sittin in a fuckin precinct
For tryin to feed a family
I need rubber walls, cause I'm fallin off the edge of sanity

[Hook]
Edge of Sanity (2X)

[Verse 2]
What a fucked up night
And I'm mad because the cop put on the handcuffs too fuckin tight
Central Bookin is where they sent me
So they could take a couple of pictures after they fingerprint me
Then they put me in a cell
And it was all full of niggas that was dirty and stinkin as hell
Four hours passed already, so now I'm yawnin
And I'm hopin to see the judge in the mornin
Finally they call my name and I get up with speed
To appear before the judge, and make a plead
I saw the judge, he was a brother
He said, "How do you plead?" I said, "Not guilty, motherfucker!"
Then I got kicked out of court, sent to the Island
Where they got all of these young brothers wildin
And all I seen was teenagers
And brothers just slicin one another with straight razors
I saw this nigga, he was stone tall
I said, "Yo, I gotta make this motherfuckin phone call"
He said, "These whores are mine, and you ain't widdit"
And put his face all up in mine, so I hit it
C.O.'s came, niggas started to zing
Now I gotta do about three days in the bank
I did my time and now I'm back from my vacation
Right on track, they put me back in population
I got dressed, and hit the mess hall
Then when I came back, FINALLY I got to make my phone call
My girl is bringin out the man in me
Cause she's yellin and shit, while I'm hangin on the edge of sanity

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm sittin Up North, and doin three to nine
And it feels like my whole life is bein left behind
I'm goin crazy in this place
And I'm countin the days, cause I'm about to be a mental case
My little son is gettin bigger
And he picked up the phone one day and thought I was some other nigga
Yeah that bitch is tryin to play me like a sucker
Cause on the down and low I heard another nigga fucked her
Now homicide is on my mind
For knowin that this bitch is at home, screwin while I'm doin time
And the nigga that's hittin the skins
Is a bold motherfucker cause he's one of my own friends
But that's alright cause I got somethin for they asses
And when I see him I'mma smash his fuckin glasses
Livin in hell but now my blood is gettin cold
Two months later, I got released on parole
So now I'm rollin colder than a blizzard
I got some iron from my man and went to pay the stupid bitch a visit
I'm ringin the bell like hell
Oh nobody's home huh? So I kicked it til the shit fell
Stepped in the house with my finger on the trigger
Butter ass nigga stuttered, "Wha-wha-what's up, nigga?"
My bitch was scared, cause she knew that I was steamin
She ran her ass to the back and started screamin
*one shot fired* to the body *two shots fired* to the head
*one shot fired* put the barrel in his mouth, makin sure he's dead
And the police ain't cannin me
Inside a cell, cause I just fell off the edge of sanity

[Hook][Female News Reporter]
"At the bottom of our news tonight, there's been a new animal aimed at falling off the face of our Earth. Yes
Young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the Endangered
Species List. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the blacks. When asked why, a top top law
Official adds, 'Because they make good game'"

(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

[Ice Cube]
Peace!? - don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figgure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue!
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder!
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy!
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...

[Chuck D] All of us are endangered, DAMN!
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

[Ice Cube]

You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
Cuz we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
It was plain and simple
The 9mm went (gunshot sound) to the temple
(gunshot sound) (gunshot sound) was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can, yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute!
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck!
Thinkin' about the payback
Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'
The shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside...

[Sampled guitar riff]
[Chuck D]
Standing in the middle of war
In the middle we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
Ebony can't see to the lightside
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin’ from the corner
Same applies with a Ph.D
Who's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin’
Who the fuck are they foolin’?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin’ brown
That's a fact
Got a fear of the bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yet Cube, they can't fuck with the
Darkside![Verse 1: Xzibit]
Bring out the big guns, 50 Cal. headshots
Put my hand up, turn my head when the gauge pops
Serial kill shit, only that real shit, like a nigga with millions
Welcome to the headlock, captivated, you old and dated while X stay activated
You display it, let the camera roll on it
You see it, but you don't want it, smother and crush my opponents
Tyson mind state, fornicate, state to state
Thank God for section 8
I'm a freight train full of cocaine to that mainland
Half a billion staying insane is the game plan
I am not the same man that you accustomed too
Everything new, cue 7 on the avenue

[Verse 2: Demrick]
I did what I had to do, longitude latitude
Fuck being a nigga half black with an attitude
Never had gratitude, young and jaded
And I guess that's why my MO is drunk and faded
The way I got here is so complicated
From way back in the day, I felt obligated
To the streets, to the roots, to the groups I came from
Never changed, kept it 100 since day one

[Verse 3: B-Real]
B-Real, Cypress Hill, raw deal, stainless steel, get your whole family killed
That's for real, lips stay seamed and sealed
If looks could kill, so much blood gone spill
I fufill, nightmares live on your street
Slow creep, 4 deep, bust with more heat
The whole neighborhood got to starve when I eat
There's nothing like a skull cracking hard on the concrete
AK-47 on repeat, straight to Hell ain't no Heaven where you sleep
Obsolete, 6 deep when I creep
When I speak, people act properly
Is it the cabbage or the cash or the broccoli
Nigga I don't give a fuck cause I want all three[Flavor Flav] Stay off his dick!

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Nigga, some don't think I can flow, so here we go
To a new track, to show the wack, that I can throw
Styles that show up, I blow up and blast here
Niggas still tripping off the shit I said last year
About a bitch is a bitch is a ho is a slut
And I don't like niggas on my nuts!
So I dedicate this one to the groupie
And the Charlie, all on my Snoopy
Brothers keep askin, "Ice Cube yo when will you bust"
They surround me and make a big fuss
Now I was taught, back on my block
That you don't ride on nobody's jock
For anything they do, FUCK him and his crew
Unless, you were gettin paid too!
I'm not saying this to diss each and every fan
Women you can ride; men, be a man!
Shake my hand, and make it a FIRM shake
Say, "Whattup Ice Cube?" and then break
Cause if you're hanging near I'mma tell you loud and clear
Get off my my dick, nigga, and tell your bitch to come here

Motherfucker, back up off me
I'm not signing no autographs, I'm not giving no free t-shirts
And I'm not HAVING none of this bullshit you're talking
YouknowhatI'msayin?

[Verse 2]
I step into the club to rub-a-dub
It seems like all the little hoes fall in love
With my money, cause yo about a year ago
I was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass bro
But you know, I just can't be equal
Cause they know I know a lot of famous people
But to a one-night stand, there's no sequel
Here's the pickle, pretend it's a Popsicle
See, for a fat booty, I do damage
They think I'm a star, so I take advantage
It's just another Ice Cube groupie fest
She's a ho cause they knew her at the front desk
Told her to meet me at the room 110
And the bitch showed up with her boyfriend
I let him in, all he could do was grin
He had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen
He said, "Yo, Ice Cube, can you sign this?"
I only did it cause his bitch was the finest
She blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown
Like, "How can we get rid of this clown?"
Me and her sat down, he got a little jealous
Cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us
And he asked me question after question
It felt like a motherfucking interview session
Then his girl got up, I heard the door shut
And he was still there, swinging from my nuts
I said, "Get the FUCK out!" and made it loud and clear
Get off my dick, nigga, and tell your bitch to come here

I see me about ten mark ass motherfucking fans
Knock on the door, talking about whassup?

Yo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man
Niggas start, niggas coming out of hotel rooms
Without no bitches!

They can get gaffled like they in a motherfucking raffle
Punk ass

[Verse 3]
Yo, I respect the respectable
If your girl is all on my dick, check the ho
Say, "Yeah that nigga he can rap fly
But you know, stars are up in the sky"
Cause all I got is hard dick and bubblegum
Just ran out my last stick is where I'm coming from
I'm not telling you to dis Mr. Ice Cube
Cause you know, I'm the one that can show and prove
Now groupie girls, I just make em wait
But the groupie boys, I can't tolerate
I hate it so much, I'mma start giving stitches
To the niggas that's staring like bitches
Cause I'm not a fairy, a Mary or a faggot
Gimme the eye, I'll fly, and tag it
Now you see? Jocking ain't healthy
Cause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy
With juice, so I see you try to run behind
But I'mma tell you, punk, you gets none of mine
Cause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool
By the niggas who terrorized the old school
So don't try me or buy me a beer
Just stay off my dick, nigga"Get down let's see your hands, see your hands!
Let's see your hands, everybody, hands!
Everybody let's see some hands! Huh?
Don't nobody move!
Don't get out of the car, stay where you're at"

Verse One:

Niggas in the street that I dislike
You better get this right
These days what the fuck is a fist fight
Picture me puttin niggas in headlocks
When I can lick off shots, and put they ass in a box
Cause if you steppin to me tryin to throw a right hook
You're just lookin to get your motherfuckin life took
Cause I can't wait to be a niggas fate
So while you lift weights, I'm liftin lite-ass nickel plates
So if you wanna misbehave nigga
I'll have to kick it to the motherfuckin grave digger
Yeah motherfucker you heard it
Doin all that rope-a-dope shit, nope, your dopey-ass murdered
Niggas'll be the Karate Kid
But I'll be in prison doin a motherfuckin body-bid
So you can take all that Rocky shit home
Sylvester Stallone ain't shit against Al Capone
Cause I ain't got no patience or energy
For motherfuckers and punk-ass suckers that wanna injure me
Step up and play me like I'm soft
Bitch I don't knock motherfuckers out, I'm knockin motherfuckers off
Leavin the scene like Machine Gun Kelly
Two to the head about four cross the belly
Steady givin niggas the runs
Fuckin clam put your fists down and go for your guns

"Alright, on the ground, face down face down on the ground
Get on the ground
Hands behind your head"

"So, so what are you gonna do?
Beat-beat the crap out of me?" NO!

Verse Two:

You punk-ass niggas better hop or chill
Cause my Glock can kill twenty motherfuckers with boxer skills
That's how I put a niggas head out
The murder scene needs more than Visine to get the red out
And I don't give a fuck if you know Judo
Cause I'mma blow your motherfuckin ass to Pluto
And when I blast the trey niggas pass away
Put in the ground til your silly clown ass decay
So all you niggas with the jokes
(Is everybody ready?) Well dibbida-dat's all folks
Cause nigga you don't want the nine to go (boom)
Niggas like Tyson woulda died a long time ago
Ran outta luck when I struck on you sucker ducks
No uppercuts you'll be another motherfucker bucked
Gettin all rumps in stuffed up boots
Hell no, I'm givin motherfuckers burial suits
Your little T.K.O was A.O.K
My way is R.I.P., niggas are D.O.A
Dead on Arrival
So nigga you better come with your gun if you want survival
From the Mak-11
And those are real shots on the motherfuckin track 7
I ain't kickin niggas buns
If it's a bitch I'mma wetta you better go for your guns

"Yo wassup, what the fuck is up now man?
What?
Where my money at man?
Hey yo, yo I told you I'd see you when I see you
Aww man you act like you wanna fight
What what? Yeah yeah alright yeah, I wanna fight" *BOOM*

Verse Three:

Rollin up on niggas wearin wigs
Cause I got a Sig for you nigs and all you motherfuckin pigs
Kool G Rap's a bad decision
Fuck front page I'm puttin niggas on television
I got heart kid if you want we can throw it out
But you ain't got no heart motherfucker when I blow it out
Straight out your back
Cause you got attacked by the mack let's see you black belt dat
Picture me doin some pushups, and get ambushed up
And put in a box all squooshed up
So motherfucker be a learner
Cause I can't hit or wrestle a niggas without pullin out my burner
So when a motherfucker want to fight
You fuck around with G and you'll be fightin Death tonight
So you don't wanna get loose G
Cause I'm givin more flat lines to niggas than loose-leaf
So come on Bruce Lee
Yo I'mma show you who the motherfucker is with all the juice G
So if you wanna intimidate
A nigga like me, great, will make your fuckin head disinigrate
I'm sendin niggas to Bedrock
Look out for the red dot
Or get your motherfuckin head shot
Niggas are dialin 911
Huh, you little bitch niggas go for your gunsVerse 1:

Yo, I wanna get high
I wanna get high

Walking through campus with my backpack
Bailin' to orientation
So I can change the nation
See many faces but none of 'em mirror me
Show my ID to the punk ass security
Step on the quad lookin' for the track squad
Walked by a bitch who think she's God
Passing me a flyer talkin' 'bout the Messiah
She wanna take me higher
Keep your rhetoric in the heavens
Look and see a bro' with a fro like Michael Evans
Done spent 6 years in the college
Always telling me to question the knowledge
Sittin' in the black hole with the black stroll
And not even one cave bitch in our click
Sayin' fuck Professor Phipps
I come from the land of the Bloods and the Crips (What's up nigga)
Don't like scholarships because they hurt me
Nothin' but a slave to the university
That's why ya see me on the track field run by ya
Caught by a liar who wanna take me higher

Chorus

Shit, he wanna take me higher
Wait until they get a load of me, shit shit
I wanna get high so high
Chocolate Thai

Verse 2:

I wanna take flight ya Goddamn right
It's a party every fucking night
Been there for about 6 weeks
Walked by the freaks
Look, black greeks
How the fuck ya figure
I dig ya me bein' from niggafied nigga
White boy in the room with me
Who never saw BET what the fuck
He's about to erupt and turn red
Start hangin' with the muthafuckin' skinheads
Cause he can't deal with the overkill
College ain't nothin' but niggerville
And he regret that his school is filled
With niggers jews and wetbacks
Plus chinks now he drinks
Hour after hour screaming white power
Motherfucker want me to call him sire
He wanna take me higher

Chorus

Shit he wanna take me higher
Shit wait until they get a load of me
Shit shit shit

Verse 3:

A girl gets date raped just like that
At a frat now she chase the cat
Feminist saying women is God's gift
Do you need a lift can I take a sniff
Do I sound sexist cause I'm chasin'
After Deja she from Texas?
Down to kick the asses of the fascists
Who wanna put me in the oven and burn me to ashes
But I'm not burnin' the world keeps turnin'
And nobody learnin'
Cause college is full of shit
Teachin' me to memorize nothin' but the lies
Chillin' at a rally for peace
The beast from white power up in the tower
With the M-1 gun and a scope on dope
Thinkin' he's the great white hope
Motherfucker levels off
He wanna see me 6 feet deep shoveled off
Cause Columbus University is nothing but a empire
Who wanna take me higher

Chorus:

Shit they wanna take me higher
Wait until they get a load of me
Shit they wanna take me higher
They wanna take me higher
Unh damn they wanna take me higher
Damn wait until they get a load of me
Damn unh they wanna take me they wanna take me
Them muthafuckas'll never break me shit[Kool G. Rap]
Brothers on the corner sellin junk
Got held up by the hotties got the shotties in the trunk
You got the hardrocks wavin Glocks at the punks
Police only harass you when they wanna get a chunk
They got so many corners and they got so many spots
And I can't even bump up the block
Without the, "Yo man, what you got?"
I'm walkin past somebody lookin strange
He's lookin for a hit for veins
Or he'll blow out somebody's brains
Even the shorties livin naughty lives
Walkin around, even drive around, with big forty-fives
I just found out the candy store's a front
They walk in the candy store
Man G, candy's far from what they want
You might see a pickle or a popsicle
But if you step to the back, you get dimes, twenties, and nickels
Honey used to look like a winner
Now she can't even get took to dinner
Cause so many dealers ran up in her
Somebody's blood is on the tar
Last night was a homicide from a fight inside the bar
Loudmouth tryin to show her ass, but somebody
Broke a whiskey bottle and cut her butt up with the glass
Money got robbed for his bank
They broke in his house and took everything
Except the kitchen sink
Little man murdered on the scene
He tried to come off at the liquor store, he's only 17
Granny's damn near pushin 80
A couple of hoods grabbed her pocketbook, and stabbed up the lady
Cover your head, cause it's a dead zone, in the red zone
Yeah, this is my home sweet home

Three card molly, another man to fool
Whites will stop at the red lights, to look at us like animals
I'm gettin frisked by the cops
They only tryin to get props, for blowin off a black man's top
Up in apartment 3G, this sweetie named DiDi wants to see me
But yo I heard she's givin VD
Just when you think the skies are gettin blue
Bang bang -- another brother's split in two
Can't sleep, cause the streets are filled with danger
Miss, your little daughter's a swinger, you can't change her
She left with a stranger, inside a drug dealer's party
Now off to the morgue, to go indentify her body
Sonny boy is goin on the strip
Robbin niggas cracks, with a mac, without a clip
Somebody gave a tip, so the next time he flipped
And shorty got ragged, another bodybag is zipped
A baby is born and needs lovin
But instead, the mother smothered him and shoved him in a oven
Cops killin our kids, but they bill us
So what's more worse, the killer cops or the Cop Killers
Everyday's another risk
I'm even mad to go to my pad, the hallways always smell like piss
No heat, just pots of hot water
I'm walkin eight flights up, the elevator's out of order
Man that landlord is the lowest
Because I let my door slam and saw a damn eviction notice
I felt like breakin all his bones, pssssh
I'm gettin kicked out of my home sweet home

*door shuts*"And now, the wonderous world of.."
"Hey, come to Los Angeles!
You and your family can have peace and tranquility
Enjoy the refinement.."
"Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?"
"Hello, my name is Elaine --
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles"

[Ice Cube]
How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove comparment
Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive

"Hi this is Elaine again
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles
Or is somebody taking your things? Have you witneesed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again."
"This is Los Angeles." "This is Los Angeles."

[Ice Cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
Cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
Cause most niggas get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho
And you won't survive in South Central

"Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
Punk motherfucker!"

And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!

[Ice Cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggas are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a price
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
Cause South Central L.A., is one big germ
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin key's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central

Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass
You tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out
And for you so called baller-ass niggas
You know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit
You'll sho' get got, just like that
This ain't no joke motherfuckers
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer
Puttin his two cents in..

"This is Los Angeles.""The army is the only way out for a young black teenager
We'll provide you with housing
We'll provide you with education
We'll provide you with everything you need to survive in life
We'll help you to be the best soldier in the U.S. of A."

"Because we do more before 7 A.M
Than most niggers do in their whole lifetime."

[Cube] Huh-huh, huh-HAH..
"I'm comin!" (repeat 3X)
[Cube] I'm comin!

[Verse One]
I wanna kill him, cause he tried to play me like the trick
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
I got the A to the motherfuckin K, and it's ready to rip
Slapped in my banana clip
And I'm lookin.. (lookin..)
Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?
It seems like he got the whole country behind him
So it's sort of hard to find him
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth
Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
Tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore
And that shit ain't fly
So now I'm settin up, the ultimate drive-by
And when you hear this shit
It make the world say "DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam."

"Do the niggas run this moth-er-fuck-er?" (repeat 2X)

{*door knocking*}
"Momma!! Some man at the front do'!"
"Sit yo' ass down."
"Uhh hi.. I have reason to believe that someone in this household
Has just turned eighteen, am I correct?"

[Verse Two]
Here's why I wanna kill the punk
Cause he tried to take a motherfuckin chunk of the funk
He came to my house, I let 'em bail in
Cause he said he was down with the L.M
He gave up a little dap
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat
I knew it was a caper
I said, "Please don't kill my mother," so he raped her
Tied me up, took me outside
And I was thrown in a big truck
And it was packed like sardines
Full of niggas, who fell for the same scheme
Took us to a place and made us work
All day and we couldn't have shit to say
Broke up the families forever
And to this day black folks can't stick together
And it's odd..
Broke us down, made us pray - to his God
And when I think about it
It make me say "DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam."

"I'm comin!" (repeat 3X)

[Verse Three]
Now in ninety-one, he wanna tax me
I remember, the son of a bitch used to axe me
And hang me by a rope til my neck snapped
Now the sneaky motherfucker wanna ban rap
And put me under dirt or concrete
But God, can see through a white sheet
Cause you the devil in drag
You can burn your cross well I'll burn your flag
Try to give me the H-I-V
So I can stop makin babies like me
And you're givin dope to my people chump
Just wait til we get over that hump
Cause yo' ass is grass cause I'mma blast
Can't bury rap, like you buried jazz
Cause we stopped bein whores, stop doin floors
So bitch you can fight your own wars
So if you see a man in red white and blue
Gettin chased by the Lench Mob crew
It's a man who deserves to buckle
I wanna kill Sam cause he ain't my motherfuckin Uncle!

"We've gone nowhere in 200 years?" "That's correct."
"We-we-we've gone nowhere in 200 years?" "That's correct."
"We-we-we've gone nowhere in 200 years?" "That's correct."[Inrto: Dr. Dre Scratching and Cutting quote below]
I know you gonna dig this....

[Verse One: Ice Cube]
Fly girls and fools each and every night
Crowd rocking rhymes, boy, that's alright
Treated like a star as you can see
But just rhyming for the cash money
Keep the crowd rocking for about B.G
New best believe that's C-O-D
Suckers like you don't make no dense
Cause it's all about making those Dollars and sense
Girls on my jack, when I'm up the stage
Reports trying to cluck, put me on the front page
C.I.A. in back of me, and cash money is all specialty
Boys In The Hood keep trying to dig
All girl friends think their heads is big
Promoters at the show trying to run that bull'
But odds got pull, get paid in full
Gold easy record cause you know it's mine
Clean my skiee-so with the FU sign
Rapping all the time on the US Mint
Plus, ring and bring Dead Presidents
TV elect, just want respect
Show me a cheque, I will break your neck
Hardcore, L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all with me
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

[Verse Two: K-Dee]
Homeboy rocked the Mic like no one else
K-Dee introduce yourself, get bounce
Dre rocks the beats, Jinx gets ill for my Posse
Ice Cube writes the rhymes to kill the show
Me breaking freaks, making dough
I was the King of teasers there on attack
You turned the wax, up to the macks
Girls in the place, to get me laid
Rhyme Zones the ace, make sure I'm paid
C.I.A. not with the dumps
Get more attention from the Me Me Amp
West L.A. is where I'm from, not a bum I didn't cum
Get some green by the leopard blues
Don't wear snickers, they'll get you around the way
Think I must ill, cause I love to chill with that dollar bill
Where I go I make that dough
Cold stop at reporter, get toss pesos
Ill, L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all easy in my fist
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

[Interlude]
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Cold rocking the microphone
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Awwww yeah, I hold my own
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Check it out, cause here I go
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Cold making that dough
[Ice Cube] YOU KNOW!!

[Verse Three: Sir Jinx]
Hip-Hop rhymes for the cash money
Sometimes a DJ, sometimes an Emcee
Turned to the cut, but that's alright
Getting paid everyday, getting laid at night
More money made, the more money spent
Making more money than the US Mint
Kick up the bass if you hip to get paying
Aim to get rich, if you know what I'm saying
Calling me a punk, you ain't making a cent
Reaching in your pocket, boy, you're snatching up lent
A.O.A got the beat going, cuts and rhymes keep the cash flowing
Dre is the producer, give the knowledge to him
Bass pumping so HARD leave the place in dim
If Barley was rapping, you knew, he'll get ripped
Cause I'm holding down L.A. like a vice grip
It's money, honey, that's no mistake
Keep Filas on my feet, big mack on plaque
Gold on my fist, my pocket's getting fat
"Why?" - it's like that, it's in my contract
Hip to play if you're hipped to pay
Jinx's spelling with.. a capital J
Death in L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all easy in my fist
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

(*Crowd Went Nuts*)

[Outro]
[Ice Cube] That was def, yeah, yeah, that was def
[Sir Jinx] Yo, can we can paid in this mothafucker..
[Dr. Dre] Rewind it, rewind it, let me hear it
[Sir Jinx] Awww, is it still going?!
[Dr. Dre] That's cool, that's cool[Hook]
It's so frustratin', so many hatin'
Somebody gon' make me break the law
But I ain't waitin', there's no escapin'
You better get ready for the war

[Verse 1]
A shotgun fanatic, who right back at it
You get mopped and dropped like a filthy habit
X, snatch and grab it, got you hopin' I fail
Cause if I fail you'd be happy like a faggot in jail
I'm full retail, guaranteed to sell
In my jet black McLaren with my mademoiselle
I'm strong-arm steady, you fragile and frail
You think you ready for them steady niggas? I can't tell
Sex sells so fuck you all, we came to bubble and ball
You gettin' shut'd own soon as I touch down
Bust rounds, enemies slayed and cut down
Fully automatic spittin' rounds with no sound
Break down your whole regime, like an M-16
Make sure the chamber in the barrel is clean
And the spring that's connected to the firin' pin
That's connected to the trigger when I squeeze it again, begin

[Bridge]
Look, my top of the world, the best of the best
King California, LAX
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects
One man, one gun, how the West was won, sing

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hit like a heavyweight
Breathe deep, meditate
Make the whole crowd get loud, make 'em levitate
I ride through my city like a presidential candidate
LAX, Phantom double R and accelerate
Stack build elevate
Crash through the prison gate
Generation hate, appetite to eliminate
X-Man don't spit rhymes, I ventilate
Traffic contraband, yeah, banned through the interstate
Got a sick flow, didn't know? Let me demonstrate
Renovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate
The left hand lands and the right hand devastates
Half part of your face replaced with a metal plate
Irate, get snatched to a better place
Let the detached decorate with the yellow tape
Detonate, drop bombs, make the earth shake
In Brazil with a half mill' in the briefcase

[Bridge]

[Hook]"What are you going to do?" (2X)
"Nigga!"
"The K the double-O the L the G-R-A-P letters"
"My mic sound nice, check one"
"The K the double-O the L the G-R-A-P letters"
"Sound nice" (cut and scratched)

[Kool G. Rap]
Rougher than Gotti, in tone
Got a body harder than Flintstone
Your girl got her skins boned
I'm diggin her down with my skintone
It's Brown-er than Bobby cause humpin is my hobby
Down in the end zone, with mens, that made her friends moan
Listen and learn and turn on your tuners if he looney
? ? I break, bang zoom, like Honeymooners
I don't want singers, but finger snappers, speaker slappers
The wickeder rapper the dapper rapper's when I flap my trapper
Got that ass gassed by Amoco, you know you ain't man to go
Dead up, head up, so I set up to slam a ho
I don't give a heck, but I don't peck on a redneck
You wanna pull cards, you're a dead deck, bed check
Lead from my tec, come and step up and get your head wrecked
Wait a sec, you comin to see what's left?
I gotta catch my breath, rappers slayed
Or played like Jeff to the left
And none of you nitwits can get with this hit shit
You dipstics, even Miss kiss, but no lipstick
I don't run a style but a mile to bust a child
Big ol snappy happy rappers smile like Gomer Pyle
Hell, I'm ringin bells with a ding-dong
I play you like ping-pong
You swingin on my ding-a-long King Kong
I pop bad cops, I got a pig a day habit
Bing bing BANG, just like the ricochet rabbit
Grab it, your sound is just like a lady baby, maybe
You're old as Grady, still in the 80's, metaphors born in Haiti
I pop to the top, now the hip-hop Glock pop rocks
Whenever it drops, I run over rappers at the record shop
You name your best I'll say, who, like owls
Pass me a towel, and I'mma move my bowels all over his vowels
Bring ten men, then I'll send my venom in em
You ain't gonna win em cause he got a women's momentum
And I don't wanna hear from this queer
Cause one of these niggas just doesn't belong here
My rhymes are like the nine millimeter Beretta
Cause anything rappers could do yo I could do it better

"The K the double-O the L the G-R-A-P letters"
"My mic sound nice, check two"
"The K the double-O the L the G-R-A-P letters"
"sound nice" (cut and scratched)

You no-frill slow toy, cheap thrills, no joy
My lyrical skills give me Pillsbury Doughboy
Back, I'm packin em up like Jack the Ripper
Some pally'll I'm pullin the zipper
Finger popped, the better the batter or flipper
You're out of date, you must be the Late Show, I hate those
Puttin on the brakes slow, uh-oh, better get Maaco
Dead-on, head-on collision, bad decision
You wanna see me nigga you better check your vision
It ain't 20/20 money silly bunny your funny
Your ass'll get smashed just like a crash test dummy
Retire, an MC that Oscar Meyer could take
Some of you wacky rappers just play anyway
That's B-O-L-O-G-N-A
So come and swing wild, mild child, and get your style hurt
HEY HEY HEY! Shit I say is Fatter than Albert
Play at your own risk, if you diss, got a lotta hot groups
Turnin cold, better go and sip on some Swiss Miss
Inner city, actin like bitties, you're pussy
So here kitty kitty, come get some milk from my ho's titties
Cross at the green not in between or get hit G
Red light, green light, one two three
Out for the dash, but in the flash, you shoulda let me pass
'fore crash, now that ass is in a bodycast
Everytime I put out my records and tapes
Motherfuckers go bananas like this was Planet of the Apes
Grapes I bust em like cherries and lay down, bitches purchase tickets
To ride the dick and sit down it like a Greyhound
Down with the clowns actin like killers, as good as wooden soldiers
See niggas, you ain't even Magilla Guerillas
Bass in your face, stingin like mace
I'm bringin the right taste, hangin like waist
Pick up the pace{*ten seconds of instrumental to open*}

Ba-block, ba-block, deep in the slums
Here they come come with the new Chucks on
Click-click, ba-block, ba-block, green in my lungs
Straight from Killa Cali got the one one one
With a tall stack in all black
With that Louis trimmin on our golf cap
Known to make 'em all fall back
It's that - Mr. Fuck Everybody I Can't Stand
And bust random
C-Walkin on another anthem
Tryin to teach these new rappers some manners
Chasin niggas out of the mic booth with a camera
Back at it loc it's Da Lench Mob and I'm more {?}
Than a can of blow, bust ya head open like canteloupe
You niggas is pussy pretend to be, we run the vicinity
Walk in the +Circle+ and lose your virginity
Put these khakis on and get out them speedos
And bow down, cause without us, there wouldn't be no
(California)

[Outro]
We get that dough
Ohhhh... we gotta get mo'
Livin just another day, AK gunplay
L.A. to the Bay, Livin life in Killafornia
Yo, we get that dough
Ohhhh... we gotta get mo'
