Tell the DJ to play whatever you want him to play

All the playas in the place steady flashin' that cash
Hoes shakin' and bouncin', I'm talkin' bout movin' that ass

I'ma shine and recline cuz I'm platinum bound
This commission rich niggas we some Southside dogs
Run my hand up your skirt, check for G-string draws
We in the club, nothin' but love it don't stop
Sittin' up outside in the Bentley Rolls drop

All the ladies on the floor it's time to shake somethin'
They bumpin', talkin' bout they ready for what?
Just hush all that chatter, and shake that butt Baby

Chorus

Third Verse (Misdemeanor):

See I like it when you shake that, make that groove

You doin' that, shakin' that like you don't want it Black
You comin' home?  Cuz girl I'm tryin' to christen that
Get into that, Keke that's how we do it Black
Ain't no stoppin' when they poppin' in the N.O.,
And on your side of town I know that's how the story goes
But when you here, dog, we gone drink all night, club all night
Man, we gone all night flight
Cuz the party don't stop in the N.O.,

I met this ho named Tameka
And she said she wanna meet'cha

She got a friend named Keisha
And she said she wanna meet'cha
Got some thangs she can teach'cha
I ain't gone lie they some freaks, brah

First Verse [Nickel Slick]:

Now when I say she vicious
The type you wanna make your Mrs.,
She freaky
Probably right now as we speakin'
Can't trust her, it's like a habit she can't quit
Suckin' a nigga dick, or fuckin' a nigga clique
And she got a partner, that's as cold as her
I ain't gone lie, I don't love 'em, I just fuck 'em, brah
I just damage their lil' wombs, and I duck them, brah
One time I hit them hoes, in the back of the car
I tore that pussy up so bad, would have thought it was war
We killed some redbones, when it's on it's on
She asked me bout my friends, so I called Dejon
But she bout some clique shit
So I called the pound and she wanted more dick
These hoes can go
She hit Priest, she hit Del, and the Weez fa sho
Say she like the accent, cuz I'm from the N.O.,
Then I turned on the fest cuz she was talkin' the mess

Chorus

Second Verse [Misdemeanor]:

Three in the mornin', rug burnin' in the Z-ride
Me and this miss here, lookin' like "Mama may I?"
Searched her thighs as we cruised in the state high-rise
Close your eyes, feel the vibe
All in favor say "I"
Thug passion, so we mashin', to the tele
Room 86, with candlesticks I'm in that belly
Poo-nanny so good, you make a nigga wanna sell it
What's my name chick?  Better yet, how you spell it?
Cuz I go deep, like Randy Moss
I be swingin' through your jungle like a modern day Tarzan
See we can, go high and upgrade it to grands
So when Tameka added Keisha, the shit got banned
You know what's happenin' ladies
You brings flames to the attraction ladies
Hot girl, cold World I'm bout that action baby
One night stand with the man of all men
After one it's wee-wee hours I be booty callin'

Chorus

Third Verse [Kangol Slim]:

My nigga 'Meanor hooked me up with this ho by the name of Keisha
When I met this ho I was like I'm glad to meet'cha
Teach ya, some of the things you like to do
Baby girl before you start, lemme round up the whole crew
Call up the crew, tell'em to come all in a hurry
We met this fine bitch straight from out the Roxbury
Ass shake just like jelly everytime the bitch walk
She breakin' some nigga heart, but it ain't my fault
Because me and my niggas gonna straight up stab the ho
We gone fuck her like a dog and send her out the door
Because
I don't love them hoes
He don't love them hoes
He don't love them hoes
He don't love them hoes
We don't love them hoes
She fucked seven niggas in one day
Wasn't even askin' for pay, we gave her twenty dollars anyway
We played her just like a cheap bitch
Cheap bitch play fit
Twenty dollars?  You can't do much of shit, you trick

That's enough about U.N.L.V
We bout to kick it about this bitch by the named of Heavy
Always wearin' a tee shirt, cuz his ass is wide
Can't sport a Tommy Hill, cuz they don't make his size
Walkin' round town, talkin' bout he's a hustler
Fat ass bitch, need to use a gut buster
Do the gangsta walk, no that ain't it
Heavy's walkin' round the city with big fat tits
Do the gangsta walk, no that ain't it

First Verse [Kangol Slim]:

I'm up Early N Tha Morning, shall I say about six o' clock?
Bout a fifty and slab, and got a couple of rocks
Broke about twelve, then I chilled on my set
Brought along my two friends, that's my nine and my Tec
Now I'm coming of age, and I start to having dreams
That I'm, dead or full of lead, two shots to my fuckin' head
It's a god damn shame that I'm still in this dope game
I think I'm in the game for the fortune and fame
Gotta stay on top, hoes can never catch me falling

Cuz a nigga like Demeanor's, all about them guts

Up and down, side to side you know I like it like that
So all you hoes get it straight, I'm not your ideal mate

So all you niggas that's stuntin' and braggin' that you bout to bone her
It's too late niggas I'm Up Early N Tha Mornin'

Please don't give me none of that crack, won't you just give me heroin?
They said that heroin is bad
I can my mind, want a Peter bag
It's a Big Boy thang, so slow me down I'm too fast
I brought along with me boys, a cubic square Therien Black
I say some Melphanine boys that's not scared to use the gat
Five oh's on our dick, tryin' to catch Partners N Crime falling
But too late man, we're Up Early N Tha Morning
Up Early N Tha Morning, I jump sheib
You want to kick it for ya and his name is Prime Time
I said I'm sloooowed, and I like to shine

Fourth Verse [Kangol Slim]:

I'm Up Early N Tha Morning, wash up my face, brush up my teeth
Gotta go on the set, I got some ends to meet
Stepped out my house stopped short, oh no!
I went back in, I forgot my Kangol
Then I dashed out the house, not looking shabby or clean
Went on the fucking corner, to serve all the rock fiends
Five-oh comes to try and catch a nigga falling
But too late man, we're Up Early N Tha Morning
Up Early N Tha Morning, I jump sheib
Me kick the funky reggae but me don't know why
Because I'm slooooowed, and all these hoes know

(Partners-N-Crime):
When I bang, I bang, it ain't nothin' but a thing

Don't get buck, get stuck
Walk that ass like a duck
Now you fucked, what's up?
That's the player haters luck

Chorus (Partners-N-Crime):

Don't try to knock or jock, we bring the funk like a fart
You get popped and dropped, by these 17 shots

(Misdemeanor):
How you gone like me and hate me?  Playa haters playa fake it
This game is shaky too many niggas be hatin'
That's how it is ya dig?
Cross me wrong lose your wig
Kidnap your kids, that's how it is in this bitch
If you fake, you fake
Real niggas don't play, we know where you stay
We bring the funk with a K
We'll tear down you clown
It's them boys from that town
We don't joke around, you hear them sounds from that round
We don't fake the funk, we got the K bullets pumped
When we lock the trunk, be stankin' shit like a skunk

Chorus (2x)

(Misdemeanor):
Thinkin' you can soar like eagles but you ain't nothin' but some pigeons
It's busta niggas like you hurtin' niggas with indecision
We know, you hatin' niggas can't STAND US
Because you know no other group can HANDLE US
I keep a four five cocked when I'm bustin' at'cha block
Non-stop and had your fuckin' head to get dropped
My advesaries be gettin' sent to mortuaries and cemetaries
Get filled with niggas that I, had to bury
It's scary livin' the street life, not thuggin'
Nigga's think in my heart is fuckin' really it wasn't
Four five bustin'
Niggas buckin' shouldn't been playin' with my Mama's baby
They pushed me to the ledge, and now they got me goin' crazy

Chorus

(Kangol Slim):
We got a Glock it's cocked, bustas run you get chopped
We disperse the shots to leave your whole body hot
See that nine milli, will split your shit like a phillie
Bullets, burn really, so don't be silly
If you tags the back, you split the shit like the fats
We retracts the macs, crime lab got the rest
If you do it, you do it
Real niggas true to it
That's why we do it, cuz real niggas pursue it
If you real you real, fake niggas play deal
And fall down the hill, banana clips, brains spill
We on that illy ill, sportin' straight from the Iberville
Big deals make meals, if niggas war we bustin' grills

Chorus (6x)[Gunfire and screaming]

[Misdemeanor]

Ah shit!  That's the way to do it!

[Dispatcher]

187 on 6th & Baronne, please send emergency units

First Verse [Misdemeanor]:

I ain't no joke with that gat smoke
Quick to bust your cantaloupe
Murder ain't shit when I'm full off that indo
See a victim watch me creep
Gotta put his ass to sleep
Caught him right, caught him right, nigga I ain't nothin' nice
Murder is a hobby, them laws they can't fade me
Bust me, frame me, them niggas must be crazy
Ever go to jail, I make bail, I'm too large
(Cuz they can't hold a gangsta on a misdemeanor charge)
Then I'm back on the streets, and that's it Black for the 9-4
Knockin' niggas off, fuckin' over five oh
Hittin' hustles, robbin' niggas, back to all that old shit
Slangin' coke, snortin' dope, it's all about my money BIATCH!!!!!

Chorus [Partners-N-Crime]:

One eightyyy, one eighty seven   (187 ain't nothin' but a misdemeanor)
One eightyyy, one eighty seven   (187 ain't nothin' but a misdemeanor)
So if you niggas wanna step I'll send your ass to Hell
A misdemeanor ain't nothin' but a 187
So if you niggas wanna step I'll send your ass to Hell
A misdemeanor ain't nothin' but a 187

Second Verse [Prime Time]:

Life is short, you'll never catch this nigga here, with his pants down
Ain't nobody fightin', grab my strap, put your hands down
Niggas boogie bang, blood spills as I pass by
Who want, that nigga in the ski mask, go breeze by
Rollin' through your hood, my passenger's a plum
Fool silence if I hear a pin drop I'ma dump
I peel a nigga's shit, straight makin' fools splatter
Pissin' fools off like my name was blat-blatta
It don't matter
Shouldn't have stared but now you covered up in plastic
Stretched like elastic, but call me sarcastic
Cuz murder ain't a thang, ain't no shame, fuck a Kris Kross
The price to play the game is heavy, life is what the shit costs
I get lost, with po po's, bailin' with they gats out
A lot of niggas creep, tryin' to run, with they backs out
I keep my bitch Niener on my side, have you seen her?
Murder is a way of life fool, 187 is a misdemeanor

Chorus

[Misdemeanor]

187 ain't nothin' but a misdemeanor
187 ain't nothin' but a misdemeanorFirst Verse [Kangol Slim]:

If I had a wish
My wish, would be this
You right in my arms
Even though I know I did you wrong
So many flashback memories
When we made love, you and me
But I betrayed your trust
And you love me oh so much

Chorus [Kangol Slim]:

Tell me do we have a chance, for our love?
(One time)
Do we have a chance, for our love?
Do we have a chance, for our love?
(Two times)
Do we have a chance, for our love?

Second Verse [Kangol Slim]:

There you are, lookin' so sexy and fine
And I really wish I could make you mine again
And I don't give a damn if you tellin' your friends
(He jockin' me)
When I think about the things that we went through
You on me, me on you
When I caught a slight joess
You put money in my store
And I don't know why I let you go, so

Chorus

Third Verse [Kangol Slim]:

Before I came home
I called you on the phone
You was lookin' at my picture sayin'
(Your hair done got long)
And you said you was ready for your man to come home
(I miss you miss you)
But when I came in the World
I started messin' round with a lot of girls
And you told me that I broke your heart
And that's what drove us apart
But I'm here to tell you, the reason that I wrote this song
Is because Girl yes, I know I did you wrong
It's a livin' fact that I want you back
You got me fiendin' like fiend when he fiend for crack
You cooked and cleaned
Did everything
That's why I give you props, cuz you did those things
When I came home, didn't have jackshit
You the one that bought the tennis that fit, so

Chorus

And I don't give a damn if you tellin' your friends

And I don't give a damn if you tellin' your friends

So look, what'cha gonna do?
It's either you gonna stay here wit'cha ol' scallywag friends
Or you gone roll with me, what's happenin' with that?
(Well you know I just gotta see first
Cuz you know when you get wit'cha boys you don't know how to act, right?)
Well look at you
It ain't even like that.  I ain't gonna sit here and act like I'm jockin' ya
I'm just lettin' you know I like you
(We'll see)
Alright it's cool...
(Yeah, we'll see)

Bridge Three [Kangol Slim]:

If you got another man

Because you comin' to spend the night
And you know I do you right
You can tell him he could kite
(Boy you ain't right)
If you got another man
I don't really give a damn

(Boy you ain't right)

Chorus

Bridge Four  [Kangol Slim]:

There will never be, another girl that do me the way that you do
Wanna kiss you and hug you

There will never be, another girl that can do me the way that you do
Cuz I love you I love you
Do you still care?[Kangol Slim]
You don't wanna start none

[Mista Menor]
I'm a fool, like them Rally Kings from the old school
Deck out, I'm bout to rep out, you better step out
The Bull rang I'm finna stank
You see my nuts? I'ma let 'em hang
If I'm the King boy rappin' just my thang
I love it, that's why I does it, I mean I do it
I'm true to it, you new to it, you Young Bucks
Better stay back or get smacked
Fill the rat, tat, tat, tat, from the Gat
Boy I lay yo ass flat
Ain't nothin' new under the sun, nor the moon
See if death hit you ass, you might think you dyin' soon
But if you doomed, then you playin' with that AK Spitter
That Hard Right Hitter, some of  South Coast Nigga
So how the fuck you figure you could disrespect me?
Lil' Red from P-N-C, boy split you in three, fuck two have ya whole crew
Lookin' for you, talkin' bout What 'Cha Gone Do?
Nigga What 'Cha Wanna Do?
Say what

[Chorus-2x]

[Prime Time]
I know you scared to flex up, you never will know
Until you get bold and tough
Enough of this bullshit that I'm hearin'
Scared to get next to Prime, cause ya fear him
Or even near him, but it wasn't No Murder She Wrote
I quote to that note, I bless so much, that I got more fans then the Pope
Even them 4-0, I'm just that dope, try'na approach PT and get broke up

[Kangol Slim]
PT tell 'em what'cha bout

[Prime Time]
Quicker to call you bluff with that gangsta stuff
Heard ya been lot of gaggin'
But I ain't havin' it, my Mother love me
But never trust me, cause quick to grab me
It's a habit that I done picked up on
To carry a chrome, since we hidin'
Nobody taught me right from wrong
The good got to suffer for the bad is this world
You avoid the hip, I promise they get splift and
On the radio yo name be annoucnin'
But ya still bouncin', I got more paper then you boys every counted
Worse then Terminator lookin' for Sarah Conners

[Kangol Slim]
God bless a nigga, that is try'na creep
Why? cause I'ma lay this nigga down six feet deep
And I got the nine and the meter on the seat
And I bust his head, and leave his brains in the street
Ride off into the Sunset, even Lil' Wayne sayin'
Kangol ya did that? You Split his wig back
All about makin' mine, get in my way and in yo face is gonna be a nine
When you awake, I never did fuck with a nigga
So I feel a nigga shouldn't fuck with me
If he do may he Rest In Peace

[Chorus-4x]Chorus (Misdemeanor):

I'm on lockdown but I'll be home in a minute
Soon as I finish, in these cells there ain't no winnin'
I'm on lockdown but I'll be home in a minute
Bet every penny, in these cells there ain't no winnin'
I'm on lockdown but I'll be home in a minute
Soon as I finish, in these cells there ain't no winnin'

First Verse (Misdemeanor):

But I'm in the system now for freedom
My man in jail put them G's up
Put the ki's up, thankin' Jesus
But if they don't, then I'll be stuck up in this bitch
They got me sick for thirty-fifth, lookin' at a year and six
Aw shit my head smokin', wasn't down for jossin'
Court date approachin', I'm through until further notice
Can't get no bond and shit
Pumpin' iron and shit
Wastin' time and shit
My family cryin' and shit
Oh well, I'm struck right chea, can't come up on a buck
Got bad luck, fuck, I guess a nigga like me is stuck
But I'm gone bounce ya heard me, believe what I said
Ain't got a DA strong enough to keep a nigga like me in bed
And all my dogs Upstate got life for rape
Straight out the pen with the flavor in your face, aight?

Chorus

Second Verse (Prime Time):

Do you know who the fuck I be?
(P.T.)
Then you know never to fuck with me

You round there reppin' and stuntin' you better do what'cha gotta do
Beefin' with the seventeenth, shoot who you gotta shoot
Cuz I be home in a year or two head bustin'
Split him wide open made him die from the head bustin'
See I'm known Uptown for bein' real, check my steelo
Hit hoes on the D-Low, ain't no hero, P.T. below zero
Enemies I make 'em bleed, chop 'em down like trees
Like Japanese with two-23's, now clown please
I'm full blooded, better get'cha mind out the gutter
More slicker than butter, but nigga no shame in my color
Now who this clown think he is?  Gonna run this til'
I paint a picture for him, cut him up, and show the bitch my skills

Bust 'em up one by one, niggas know how it's done

Me and my nigga's been bustin' heads to make a mil
I'mma fool from the old school
You said you gonna leave my Dreads in my Tennis Shoes

An arm, a leg, you might loose
But look you choose to be that fool

{Chorus}
{Till the End}[Kangol Slim]
Hey Mami

Baby shake it for me
Bounce it up for P-N-C
Shake and pop for me!
C'mon now won't you shake that Mami!

Love it when you hit the floor and you shake that body!
Where all my niggas that like to keep the club crunk?
And smokin' that fire skunk with P-N-C and get drunk
And you know that P-N-C gone represent
South Coast, keep on droppin' Platinum hits
Got somethin' if you haters want to trip
So all my niggas tell them hoes hit the floor and make it bounce to this

[Chorus]

[Mista Meanor]
When made this one for the niggas and the bitches to buck
It's bananas, everybody tearin' shit up
They got hoes backin' it up, niggas actin' up
See the party don't stop til' ya had enough
What'cha know about catchin' the wall, walkin' the dog?
With a real nigga standin' behind ya, breakin' ya off
Done been around the World but seen nothin' like y'all
Freshened up with big balls I'd love to hit y'all
Could make the bed rock like we're the Flintstones
C'mon, let a nigga hit'cha it's a stiff bone
Goin' round to my crib now, I gots to get home
I'm like Biggie you can just call me dead wrong
I wish my nigga P was here to see it all happen
He loved money, loved women, and he loved rappin'
My cousin Fatman, Wodie he just came home
So from a real nigga keep ya fuckin' head strong

[Chorus]

[Kangol Slim]
I made this jam for my niggas [niggas]
Bitches [bitches]
Throw yo hands up in the air if ya wit me
My niggas [niggas]
Bitches [bitches]
Throw yo hands up in the air if ya wit me
If you up in the club niggas tearin' it up and
If you smokin' on somethin' tell niggas to light it up
Tell the ladies back it up
If you a thug, then bump
Throw yo sets in the air
Represent and don't give a fuck

[Mista Meanor]
Since I'm here hit the dance floor and Do What'cha Do
It's an nighter baby we can go there to
Bayou Boy got yo broad straight catchin' the wall
De'Jon and Lil ' All got 'em takin' it off
They got Del and ??? plus they sendin' 'em back to
The 13th Chuck can't forget about Mac
South coast thang we gone keep it jumpin'
P-N-C in yo town we gone keep it bumpin'

[Chorus][Chorus: repeat 4X]
Down South we play the game, we play it raw

[First Verse: Kangol Slim]
I'm strictly bout makin' my money
Strictly bout makin' my cheese
All these haters straight hatin' me
Cuz I'm on a paper chase for the collard greens
Monitor this, I handle my biz
Support me and my kids, I gotta get the dividends
Even if it mean committin' a sin, kickin' doors in
Muthafucka you a foe or friend?
Game is real, we playin' it raw
Down South, if you got it to see, we runnin' off in your house
Duct tapin' your arms, your legs, and your fuckin' mouth
When we get what we want, tellin' you to ride out
Never leavin' a trace
Sprinkle some ye round the place
Now you're known to the D.A
That's a closed case
So don't fuck with them hounds
We lay it down
Ask a clown when we buck around
Muthafuckas better lay down
We play it raw

[Chorus] (2x)

[Second Verse: Tre-8]
I'm missin' a certified death wish
Nigga wanna step to this gettin' blows to the dome
And I cock the chrome, it's on, strong gone
Niggas don't last long, I got'z to get my blast on
With the black mask on
Got a tool for my getaway
Servin' with the AK got the double clip
Plus the hollow tips nigga make way
You'll get blazed today
And I'ma say what I gotta say
Niggas gotta play, the game how I play the game
Droppin' bombs on your town everytime mane
It ain't a tongue it's a mind thang
Funky little rhyme game
Where nobody go, nigga movin' too slow
I don't changed the whole time frame
Now it's rangin' and clangin' them bitches
We stained them bitches, lookin' stupid like hoes
Bringin' the pain to these hoes
With flows and blows of death
Makin' niggas sweat like hot sauce
Runnin' up my block bruh
Make me put my top down
Break you off proper
Pussy poppers over the World had better hide
Look into my eyes as I cock the nine
Niggas die when they try to see me
Nobody can beat me rappin' this fast and easy
The sequel, me runnin' with PNC, G, and we be raw
We be the coldest muthafuckas that you ever saw nigga we be raw

[Chorus] (2x)

[Third Verse: Misdemeanor]
We bes, the dopest muthafuckas that you ever saw
Spinnin' out of Lexus cars playin' the game raw
These niggas better recognize the real when caps get peeled
Me and my nigga Tre leavin' brains just spilled
That's on the real, you can get killed
If you want, hit your ass two times up in the chest with the pump
Throw your ass in the back of the flip-flop trunk
Ride wit'cha your lady I'll dump you off at the dump
When ya hurtin' for birth, til' the day you live the Earth
When you was on, that bitch should've worn a fuckin' skirt
Ol, sissy ass nigga I had to get wit'cha
Now your Mom and Dad sayin' they miss ya, had to give 'em a tissue

[Chorus] (4x)[Chorus: repeat 2X]

(Strange Voice)
Ay yo, peel yourself off, we might give you a job

(Misdemeanor)
Ol' clucka muthafucka, been said it ass sucka
Probably burnt your lady fuckin' junkies with a rubber
Boy where your son at?  Pussy ass Ya Fat
Still smokin' crack?  Hope you got your mind back
Tryin' to diss my nigga Third, jockin' his ex
All in her face, trickin' off your crazy check
You'z a ho, I know you know, let your colors show
Or should I beat that up like Glenn beat you after four?
Well beep beep beep, there goes that little red elite
We used to play schoolers back in elementary
Yella Boy back at Eastern, you used to be a dancer
But now in '94 I guess them golds make you gangsta
First the Eddie Bow then you tried the Hike
I guess you caught a flat on that little red bike
'Cise break it down, yeah we bout to act a fool
Won't you bring that fuckin' track to that fuckin' old school?

Chorus

Second Verse (Kangol Slim+Prime Time):

(Kangol Slim)
Well if I never knew a clucker now I know one
Got a couple of grams, Tec-9 you wanna score one?
Niggas always tryin' diss, but you know you lookin' pissed
You done made my hit list, you baboon lookin' bitch
Never take shit from a busta
Never take shit from a clucker
You tried to diss my clique?  You'z a stupid muthafucka
Went on to bite my style
Give us a towel
Make my Uncle know that you dropped a diss, but it's too late
You shouldn't put out another tape
You say you fucked my boy ol' lady
Then I find out much later that she had your baby
Now I know it may seem a lil' crazy
But is that really his baby?  Nigga Maybe
Nigga it's Drama Time, watch yo back
Get your gat
Before I hit your ass, I'm talkin' to the nigga named Ya-Fat
Fuck the UNLV, I'm down with PNC
And I roll with them niggas off that C.A.B
My nigga, Eazy-E, look here and Cat Daddy
And can't forget about the Big Money and G-Money
Yep I'm comin' for your ass so it's best you wear your vest
I forgot this bird than flew the Cuckoo's nest
Always wanna use a gun, lookin' like Fat Albert's son
You better run cuz muthafucka here I come
That's a lil' coward ass Yella Boy
That's a lil' coward ass Yella Boy
That's a lil' coward ass Yella Boy
That's a lil' coward ass Yella Boy

(Prime Time)
I biggedy bounce just like Slim
Don't give me that foolish like Pimp
I ask them hoes like three nine
I'm paid in full like Rakim
I'm knockin' 'em out like E-A-B
Don't love them hoes like P-N-C
I'm down with Bust down, and got beef like Sporty T
Like I told you before, in the deep N.O
I'm Prime Time and I'll break you off, and that's somethin' I know fa sho
So come your back blown out if you fuckin' wanna
Fuck with P-N-C I'll put your ass up in a corner

(Strange Voice)
Oh it's a Big Boy thang
A power move swang
Don't fuck with our boys cuz you know you can't hang
It's a Big Boy thang
A power move swang
Y'all busta ass niggas can't hang

(Prime Time)
I'll take you bitch off the map
When it's time to strap, bust a cap
That fake ass track, and that fake ass rap
Get off the map
To that bitch Ya-Fat, I'ma make you go get'cha gat
I heard you mouthin' off track
Don't take no time to get smacked
And to that bitch Tec-9, you must don't mind dyin'
Fuckin' with Prime, wrong nigga, you better be packin' that iron
Save the pussy for last, Yella boy you gettin' dissed
Tryin' to rep on the Prime, you albino lookin' bitch
And with that fake ass Eddie Bow, shit is played out of style
I'ma make you worth your while, with a big ass smile
You round here reppin' and stuntin' talkin' bout y'all about it
Tryin' to diss PNC, Misdemeanor I doubt it
From a studio prankster to your label's obsessive gangster
Fuck around and I'll stank ya, might as well spank ya

Chorus (2x)[Meanor Talking]
Whoa, we gone do it like this
It's 96 mother fuckers

[Chorus]
Bitch I got Gucci
Bitch I got the green, got the black
I got Gucci bitch I got the brown and all that
I got Gucci bitch I got the high and low to
I got Gucci bitch that ain't no ordinary shoes

Remember back in the day's
Niggas wore Bailey's in shit and
They always hooked it up with a fresh Polo fit
How ever I'm a fool
Now Gucci shoes  now money rules
Now hoes screamin' whoa now
Shibe as hell when I'm bailin' up out the crib
Lavish is how I live don't have a damn thing to give
Now please don't get me wrong
I do with Nike and Reebok's
But even see me barely with some
Kenny Cole high tops
But she see, see I
I rep 'til I die
Black, brown, green or blue
Three bills a whop it ain't no ordinary shoe
Don't play my Gucci bitch just because you got on a
Mother fuckin' thirty dollar outfit
Don't play my Gucci bitch just because you got on a
Mother fuckin' thirty dollar outfit
Not braggin' on what I got
People say I ain't got nothin'
But to a nigga like me I got a Lil' somethin' sumthin'
Shibe gift Balley Five, house with leather inside
Gucci wear livin' fair people stare but I don't care
Hoes like to laugh when they see me drivin' in my Hoopty

[Mista Meanor]
Kangol what you got?

[Chorus]

[Mista Meanor]
Now I'm not braggin' I be raggin'
Girbauds always saggin'
Best from the best
Because the Meanor can't be laggin'
I sport Gucci cause they suit me
Knock the walls of some cucci
Them hoes braggin' bout me
Is nothin' but some groupies
Slug by the T, them Gucci down to the feet
'Cise why all them niggas player hatin' on me
Shibe is in my nature

[Kangol Slim]
Then why them niggas hate you?

[Mista Meanor]
But it's all good cause they all gone catch the Vapors
$299.00, $75.00 get a pair
Stop lookin' in my face cause it ain't cool to stare
I'm bad as Fiend, ask them hoes if I'm clean
Me Michael screamin' Martin Luther "Have a Dream"
Player haters get mad because a nigga be shibe
Mista Meanor is the name, Big Boy is the job
I stay up on my gear, because I got to look nice
If you don't have any Gucci's
Well it's cool on the right
Cause everybody can't afford 'em
That's why they can't sport 'em
But I sport Gucci's like Mike sport Jordans
I'm not try'na brag or put nobody down
But I got Gucci the high top black, and high top brown
Gucci not cheap, they cost $300.00 a whop
Bein' shibe is in my nature
So that's never gone stop
So player hater's that's mad
Strach yo ass and get glad
I know ya fall to yo knees and
Pray to God I do bad
So respect this red nigga
Cause I'm true to the game
If you didn't know now you know
Meanor's the name

[Chorus]

[Prime Time]
Now hoes bein' tr'yna juke
We bustin' fits with the Gucci
After that we finish it off with a
Fresh ass cucci
Bust some fresh Baud-Bauds
Even a fresh Polo, could be the black Kenny Cole
Even some black Animals
Better never the less, I guess
I been taught by the best to impress
Some of these hoes best to learn how to dress
Cash Money click better come real
P-N-C movin' to make an mil
With the skill that's fa'real
Go buy my feet with three bills
Now I've been known to be an gangster
Wearin' black on black
Gucci down to the side
Keep a strap that's a Gat
Steppin' on my Gucci's get bucked
After that you get fucked up
You know you done lucked up
My Gucci wasn't scuffed up
G-U-CC-I is what I sport when I'm shibe
Before I die I'm makin' them hoes famous
From my walk side

[Chorus]

I got Gucci Gucci [repeats]* - note, that Partners-N-Crime pronounce it "HAIR-OWN"

But I need a heroin bag cuz bitch, I'm itchin'

Nigga roll on the set, who it is?  Five oh
Pack the shit, close shop, and we'll be ready to go
Five oh's on my back, cuz they think that I'm holdin'
But I'ma let them muthafuckas know
That I done got too loaded, too loaded, too loaded, too loaded
That I done got too loaded, too loaded, too loaded, too loaded
They say that cocaine's bad, but that heroin's worse
So Kangol Slim kick the next fuckin' verse

Chorus

Second Verse (Misdemeanor):

Aw shit, my mind done clipped, that heroin's got me trippin'
I done did too much wrong, I might get caught slippin'
My nose started bleedin' evidence is showin'
Heroin's got me gone and everybody's knowin'
My mind is in another World as spooked as I wanna be
Constantly watch my back because I think these niggas after me
Five oh is ridin' my dick mane
Because they think that the Meanor, is sellin' cocaine
But that's not it, I just love to get high
So I snort a lil' heroin just to make time fly
And check it, when I get high, I really get blowed
Snortin' nothin' but the heroin up my muthafuckin' nose
Cuz um, when I get high, I really get blowed
Snortin' nothin' but the heroin up my muthafuckin' nose, so

Shoot a little bit of heroin, and that shit makes everything so fun...First Verse (Kangol Slim):

Baby, I love what'cha doin'
The way you move it
And you groovin' your body up on the dance floor
Baby let me know, if you wanna go
I can take you to the places that you wanna go
If you roll with me, baby you will see
How it is to roll with a H-O-U-N-D
So baby do your thang, makin' it bounce and swang
Make a brotha wanna come over and ask your name
Go head and hustle girl
Hustle round the World

Chorus (Kangol Slim):

Cuz I like the way
You back that thang on me
Love it when you're shakin' your body
I love it when you turn me down
Make me tell the DJ to play
Whatever you want girl (go head and do your thang)
Whatever you want girl (just make it bounce and swang)
Whatever you want girl (go head and make it move)
Whatever you want girl (cuz I like when you do what you do)

Second Verse (Kangol Slim):

There's one thing that I got to know
I seen you shakin' from across that floor
When you came to back that thang on me
Was there somethin' that you wanted me to see?
Cuz best believe me girl, maybe I could see
Everything is perfect from your head down to your feet
I love it when you shake
That's why you're really made
Tell the DJ to play whatever you want him to play

Chorus

Third Verse (Kangol Slim):

Girl the way that you move

Girl your body is so sweet
From your head to your feet
Go head and do what you do
Makes me want to get with you
The way you shakin' on the floor
Makes me want you more and moreBridge One (Kangol Slim):

I met this girl at the C-L-U-B
She gave me her phone number, told me "Won't you call me?"
She told me hit her bout a quarter to three
I hit her on her celli and guess what she told me?
She said....

Chorus (N-Dow):

I've been watching you for a long time
Having dreams of making you mine
So won't you come on over to my place?
Hurry up cuz I don't want to wait

(3x)

First Verse (Kangol Slim):

Now when I hit the club scene, she was jockin'
I don't know if it was the gear or the way the diamonds rockin'
But she stared at a nigga, from afar
Standin' out like a star drinkin' crown and coke at the bar
And I'm wonderin' who she can be?  Tell me what's her name?
Shoulda stepped to this pretty thang, spit a little game
And she walked in my way, looked at me dead in my face
Lookin' sexy, right now I'm thinkin' of some good words to say
I told her, "Senorita, nice meetin' ya
I have some things I could teach ya"
I said "I want her", she said she want me
Gave me her number, told me hit her a quarter to three
Senorita, nice meetin' ya
I have some thing I could teach ya
I said "I want her", she said she want me
Gave me her number, told me hit her a quarter to three

Bridge One

Chorus (1/3x)

Second Verse (Mista Menor):

God damn!  First date and we bumpin' and grindin'
What?  You call me a dog and you the first to whinin'?
Ain't no shoppin' sprees Baby, I ain't the one for dinin'
You can stop that cussin', you can stop that cryin'
I don't trick, I treat when I deals with mine
And that lovin' me shit?  You can stop your lyin'
I've heard of love at first sight, but sex the first night?
You'll make a real nigga think you ain't playin' it right
Girl I'll tell you anything when I'm between them legs
And you might hear "I love you" when you're on the head
That's the words that every real nigga done said
Let a spade be a spade that's the tricks of the trade

Bridge One

Chorus[Mista Meanor]
Got to make them pay, ok
We got to peep out the plate
Cause niggas is kickin' in doors, and
Killin' niggas every day
First thing's first
We need some balls on this bitch
Cause if they kickin' in doors man we gone be sick
Prime round up the crew because we need to have a meetin'
Plus I seen his Cutlass on the corner so they creepin'
Beep DE-Del's he got a Fully Automatic
Hit Landen on the phone and let him know but the static
Catch the door because I hear somebody knockin'
Grab the Glock because you know they out there plottin'
It's the crew, let 'em in it's about time
Cause niggas is gettin' to lax in this
Fuckin' World of crime
Fella's take a seat and listen to what I have to say
Some niggas in a Cutlass try'na bring the noise our way
Peeped his game, I got a plot on them snitches
We Lock up the lab and put an ends to them bitches
Tim you got an Nine an AK and a Automatic
Threat got to get the Tec's out that mother fuckin' attic
Drama Squad I held this fuckin' meetin' for a reason
Cause it's 95 the playa haters fuckin' season
All for one, one for all that's how we ball
There's Muslims in the hood
Out there slangin' furl call
I tell you the truth, I tell you no lie
I hope I die cause Drama Squad is takin' over 95
His game is cold, we got to be colder cause we older and
Since we older we got to be fightin' like fuckin' soldiers
Cause I ain't goin' down for no niggas nor no feds
The best thing we need to do is
Lock up the Lab

[Kangol Slim]
Now Meanor I peeped yo block
Now peep this
I say we mob up and turn them niggas into Swiss
Cheese that is got to beep Landen for the 95
Cause niggas be takin' no jobs
They want a nigga dead or alive that ain't shibe
Lock up the Lab, put away the Slab
Laugh it's gonna be a bloody blood
By a nigga try'na take my dividends
Still got a friend Benjamin Franklin
Check his plot so there's proof
Meanor get on that roof
Call me and he gone be a goner
Somebody be strong on that corner
Everybody run behind a tree
Lookin' for the Bee's if they move then squeeze
Triggers on yo gun
Yeah we bout to have a Lil' fun

Don't stunt, don't front, show 'em how to pop, and
Raise yo hands up, and show 'em how to Tiddy Bop
Now back it up like a drunk, I take a load off
I would try to take you home, but I'ma hold off
I'm kinda drunk, kinda blowed, kinda throwed off
You gonna make a nigga like me straight go off
I probably would, if I could, but a nigga can't
If you can do this in the club you probably make me faint
Now look at her?

[5th Ward Weebie-Chorus]

[5th Ward Weebie]
If you bend that ass over, spread them cheeks
Back it up Lil' Weebie 'til you touch that D
I ain't gone lie baby girl, I been a freak
If you got that fiyah mouth, then you can hit the streets
Cause I fucked a ho, fucked a ho
Hit that pussy, let it go
Look at Lil' Wootay pussy bigger then a dinosaur
5th Ward Weebie, gotta keep you hoes busy
Don't stop twerkin' 'til the song is finished
Now back it up, shake it up
Let me see ya wobble baby
Ooo drop stop it baby
Ooo now drop it baby
Tear it up, turn around make that booty hussle
That thong so tight, I think you bought to pull a muscle
Work the pussy, don't shake it to hard
You might hurt the pussy, eyes open to I beat it up
'Til I Clutch the pussy, girl put this in yo mouth
That wood so hard, I'm bout to knock yo teeth out

[5th Ward Weebie-Chorus]

[5th Ward Weebie]
If you back that ass up, girl do what 'cha do
If it's All On U, girl do what 'cha do
If you skinny or fat, girl do what 'cha do
Ha! Do what'cha do
Ha! Do what'cha do
Ha! Do what'cha do
Now work the pussy, now work the pussy
Now twerk the pussy, now twerk the pussy
Don't ride the pussy, don't hurt the pussy
Now show the pussy, now serve the pussy
Now wobble on the dick
Ooo swallow that dick
