[Intro]
(Krispy Kreme/Froggy Fresh)!
2012, yeah, we back up in this
Y'all already know
Cause

[Hook]
I am the baddest of them all
If you ain't 'bout money, then I don't mess with y'all
Y'all think I don't get girls, cause I ain't very tall
If she see my stacks, I bet you that she calls

[Verse 1]
I had to fight my whole life
I could beat you up even if you had one thousand knives
Even if you had infinity knives
I would punch you up into the air like a kite
I bet you sleep with a nightlight
Cause you're scared of the dark
Cause you stink like a fart
Well I'll light your fart on fire with my rhymes
You think I won't? I do it all the time
I bet I got more money than Jay-Z
Compared to me, Jay-Z is lazy
Plus Beyonce thinks that I'm cute
It's okay Beyonce, I think you're cute too
I made out with so many girls
Made out with every girl in the world
I might look small, but I'm not
I don't care if you're big, I'll fight you a lot
You know that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I have four hundred cars
I have four hundred scars and four hundred guitars
I have four hundred houses
I have four hundred mouses and four hundred houses
Bet you I can dance better than you
I bet you you don't know two plus two
It's four! It's four!
Now go and shut the door
Cause nobody wants to see your face no more
I'm tough as nails
You're slower than a snail
I beat up every single person in jail
I dare you to try and punch me
My face is so hard you'll say, "Ouch, you crunched me"
I fought two lions and won
And I don't even carry a gun
But I never run, but I never run
But I never r-r-r-r, but I never run
You know you know that

[Hook]

[Outro]
Uhh, (Froggy Fresh/Krispy Kreme)
I already told you we back up in this
2012 to infinity
Hah, get out of here, peace[Verse 1: Froggy Fresh]
Out on the court for a game of two on two
Me and Mike versus James and his boy Big Blue
We headed off to Kevin's house right after school
Cause he got that new lifetime basketball hoop
We came ready, we came ready to play
We came ready to win and bring the trophy home that day
Big Blue said you ain't bringin' home that W
How you gon' score when I'm standin' here in front of you
I grabbed the ball and I passed it into Mike
Mike caught the pass faked left and went right
He drove through the lane and he threw it off the glass
I couldn't believe my eyes he was runnin' so fast
Caught the pass in mid-air and he threw that boy down
Nobody could believe it James fell over on the ground
He started cryin' put his hands in his head
Then Big Blue looked at me and Mike, then he said

[Hook: Froggy Fresh]
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Verse 2: Froggy Fresh]
James was mad, I could see it in his eyes
James never gets dunked on and James don’t ever cry
He stood up, beat his fist on his chest
Looked at me and Mike and ran his thumb across his neck
He grabbed the ball, squared up to the hoop
Took a hard right step and then he slipped in dog poop
Me and Mike started laughin' and he deserved it too
For the rest of the day we called him Captain Poopy Shoe
Then the ball bounced right over to me
Big Blue was so big I could barely even see
I took the ball and I threw it in the air
Although I couldn’t see a thing I had a feelin’ Mike was there
He grabbed the ball and did an alley-hoop dunk
Right on top of James, he made him look like a punk
Then James’ girlfriend walked by
She stopped right there and looked me square in the eye
She said

[Hook:]
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Verse 3: Froggy Fresh]
For the rest of the game, the lead went back and forth
It was all tied up when I checked the scoreboard
There was only 10 seconds left on the clock
James went in for a layup but his shot got blocked
And then juked out Big Blue
With the spin move, I was headed straight for the hoop
I looked at Mike, put my hand up in the air
James was standin' in the way but you know I didn’t care
Mike threw a perfect pass and I jumped so high
I was way up in the sky, dog it felt like I could fly
I grabbed the ball and I threw it down hard
Right on top of James, I felt like a superstar
That’s how me and Mike won the basketball game
We beat Big Blue and Big Bad James
Cause me and Mike are the number one team
And we heard James cry and we heard his mom scream
She said…

[Hook]
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Outro: Froggy Fresh]
Yeah, you come up in here you’re gonna get dunked on
Peyton and Kemp
Penny and Shaq
Pippen and Jordan
Boy, me and Mike are bad
Hey![Intro]
Hey everybody it's Krispy Kreme
And I'm back on another track
This one's for the club

[Verse 1]
I've been shot about 500 times
And I've done about 1 million crimes
I killed a great white shark
I knocked out his teeth, and I ripped out his heart
Talk crap and I'll give you a scar
Talk crap I'll throw eggs at your car
I'll cut holes in your tires
I'll put poop on your porch and I'll light it on fire

[Hook]
Yeah, said everybody wants to be me
The only problem is they can't even see me
Ball so hard record labels wanna sign me
Life is a race and everybody's behind me

[Verse 2]
Everybody gets scared when I front flip
If you come around here then you're done with
Have you ever been to the county fair?
I rode the Fireball and I wasn't even scared
I got swallowed by an anaconda snake
Then I told him, "You just made a big mistake."
Cause all I had to do was go like this
And just like that, I killed him with my fist

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And everybody's behind me
And everybody's behind me
Life is a race and everybody's behind me
(Ahh!) Alright, let's go

[Outro]
Everybody on the left put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody on the right put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody in the back put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody up front put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreeeeeeme!"
Yeah! Krispy Kreme!
Yeah, that's for all the haters, and that's for all my fans
West side!
We out, peace![Intro]
Froggy Fresh
And Money Maker Mike
And Gator Jones
And Jimmy Butler
This is for the Bulls

[Hook x2]
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout that man, Jimmy Butler
Put the whooping on the Cavs, they's imposters
I ain't gon' lie, LeBron, you's a baller
But Jimmy Butler is your father

[Verse 1]
The end of the 2010 season
Cav's fans nervous, cause they knew LeBron was leavin'
And he did, took his talents down to South Beach
Built that Frankenstein team and won a couple rings
Dang Cleveland, tell me what the heck is that?
First you burn the dude's jerseys then you buy him back?
LeBron left you like a hot girl in high school
Then when the Heat broke up, you took him back, fool
Do you smell that?
Something smell like desperation
But the Bulls, they been sitting back and steady, waitin'
Yeah, they been through the trials and the tribulations
Look at all the injuries Derrick's been facin'
Cleveland beggin' 'Bron to win a ring
With that brand new Frankenstein team
Give it three years, bet you if he doesn't win
Then Cleveland gonna burn his jerseys once again

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Jimmy hit 'em with that lockdown defense
LeBron twice his size, but Jimmy's straight beastin'
LeBron's stressed Jimmy gonna give him grey hair
What you talkin' 'bout, LeBron's hair ain't there
LeBron out here spraying hair out of a can
C'mon, LeBron, dude, shave your head man
Jordan shaved his head back in '89
Your hair's fallin' back, where you goin' draw the line?
And your bigs can't handle Pau in the post
You give him room, he'll pop a jumper from the free throw
And you know I love my big homie, Joakim
I ain't gon' lie, homeboy, I love the whole team
Happy Mother's Day, LeBron, hope you having fun
Happy Father's Day, Lebron, cause you're Jimmy's son
Now the Cav's all 'bout to get slaughtered
Cause Jimmy Butler is your father

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Yeah
Froggy Fresh
Money Maker Mike, Gator Jones, Jimmy Butler
And all the Bulls
Let's go, Bulls[Verse 1]
You could love me you could hate me
But you won't ever break me
I shall not fear a thing for my dear lord will not forsake me
Persecute me, boy you could shoot me homie
You could stone me
You could lock me up in solitary, all I know is lonely
All I know is work, all I know is hurt, all I know is pain
All I know is rainy days, all I know is chains
It's me and Mike, it doesn't matter what our name is
You can't take away our dreams and we got dreams of being famous
I done seen too many souls become a victim of the system
Either wind up flippin' burgers or they're packed inside a prison
I don't want it, I don't want that for my fam
Something we cannot stand
We will scrape and crawl into our promised land
They do not know me, therefore they cannot hold me
Watch me break into the upper class and bring all of my homies
Cause you're my brothers and I love you as I do myself
I put that on my health, what is wealth without a common will

[Hook]
I'm Froggy Fresh and I ain't gon' rest
Ain't gonna stop until you pull this heart out of my chest
On the same old street in the same old crib
Yeah the name done changed, but I'm the same old kid
Screamin' I'm Froggy Fresh and I ain't gon' rest
Ain't gonna stop until you pull this heart out of my chest
On the same old street in the same old crib
Yeah the name done changed, but I'm the same old kid

[Verse 2]
They cannot stop us because we are a movement
Whether you are my brother or some kid I went to school with
Dog I ain't no would-be, they're scared and they should be
Yes now they are afraid of the idea of what we could be
We will be, boy you could cut my tongue out, you could kill me
But you won't ever ever stop the spirit that does fill me
Cause love don't ever die, I thought you knew by now
You stop our breath, you dig a grave, and put us in the ground
I just hope that when I go, I go out with a smile
Proud as they stack me and my homies in a pile
And I will pass away as I have done before
It only took me 'til the age of 9 to learn that life's a war
And I can't even lie, you don't want it, you know why
Cause when you look me in the eye you know I ain't afraid to die
Cause there's victory in death long as you die for something great
If death is what it takes for me to win then I won't stay

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And they won't ever tell you, but they hate to see you make it
And as soon as you get something for yourself they wanna take it
Well go on, you can have it, I'll look away while you grab it
Boy I don't need no stacks and I don't need no baller status
Ain't no power in the dollar, but the power's in the people
Cause our wallets ain't the same don't mean we ain't created equal
I don't need for you to clap, I don't need for you to cheer
I just hope that when I speak that there's somebody there to hear
And I don't need no castle, cause every castle crumbles
I know that I'm gon' stumble, I just hope that I die humble
I hope that I stay down to earth and grounded
Because my fortress is the human race by which I am surrounded
I hope you love me, I hope you love me
I hope to God that there's a heaven up above me
I see the beauty, the beauty in what we could be
So my dear brothers let us all be what we should be

[Hook][Intro]
They had Mike, and I knew it was my job to get Mike back because Mike was my best friend, and I told him that if anything ever happened to him, I would be there for him. Well, it was time for me to be a man of my word. I had to save Mike

[Verse 1]
They got Mike, we gotta get him back
Cause I told him I would always have his back
We've been friends back when we was this tall
We was making money before we could even crawl
Now they took him, I don't know what to do
But we got one rule, don't mess with the crew
It's all for one and one for all
We die for our brothers, that's how we ball
I made some calls and got some names
I heard about some guy named James
James and Mike had beef last week
Cause James ran over Mike's bike with his Jeep
I found out where James's house was
James had guns, and James sold drugs
So I knew that it was gonna be hard work
But I wasn't scared cause James is a dumb jerk

[Hook]
I said, "Mike, I'm coming for you, homie"
Cause Mike's always got my back when I'm lonely
And I always got his back when we fight
I'm coming for you, Mike, I'm a save your life
I said, "Mike, I'm coming for you, homie"
Cause Mike's always got my back when I'm lonely
And I always got his back when we fight
I'm coming for you, Mike, I'm a save your life

[Verse 2]
I got dressed in my camouflage gear
I looked to the sky, and I cried one tear
I said, "God, I hope that You're with me
And don't let me die cause Mike's gonna miss me"
So I started off towards James's house
And I was moving quiet like a mouse
I seen Mike tied up in the street
There were ropes around his hands and ropes around his feet
James ran up, and he began swinging
But he was no match for the fire I was bringing
I knocked James out with one punch
Y-yep, yep, he had a knuckle sandwich for lunch
I ran over, and I untied Mike
And then we both took off on my bike
I said, "Mike, I love you, big homie"
He said, "I'll always have your back when you're lonely"

[Hook]

[Outro]
This song's for all you best friends out there, 'kay? You make sure you always got each other's backs, you understand? Cause if you don't have each other's backs, ain't nobody gonna have your back. Rest in peace, 2Pac Shakur. Everybody misses you. Peace!Krispy Kreme
And Money Maker Mike
A Christmas song

[Verse One]
First thing on my list go figure
Its a brand new John Cena action figure
Second thing on my list guess what
Its a a really cute girl with a really cute butt
Mike said Krispy Kreme hold up
Mom said your not allowed to touch a girls butt until your grown up
That's right I forgot about that rule
Not allowed to touch butts until you graduate from school
But that's all right cause third on my list
Is a brand new John Cena watch for my wrist
Now were moving on to item number four
Its a brand new John Cena poster for my door
Check check it out y'all item number five
Its a brand new John Cena car that I can drive
Well I can't really drive it cause its too small
But I could if I was maybe like this tall

[Hook]
Christmas Christmas come check out my wish list
Have I been a good boy that's none of your business
I just want some good toys can I get a witness
Got all of my homies yellin' Christmas Christmas
Christmas Christmas come check out my wish list
Have I been a good boy that's none of your business
I just want some good toys can I get a witness
Got all of my homies yellin' Christmas Christmas

[Verse Two]
Item number six on my list is on lock
Gotta get that super hot John Cena lunch box
So tough the thing is made of steel
No more using brown paper bags for my meal
Item number seven is like a bite of heaven
I could probly' eat like ten or eleven
Check up in my stocking and guess what I found me
A brand new box of Betty Crocker fudge brownies
Item number eight player don't hate
Its probably the best toy in the whole state
A item so hot it could make the snow melt
Its a brand new John Cena wrestling belt
Now I gotta think about what I want from grandma
How about a brand new pair of John Cena pajamas
And one more thing I want even though I already have
It is the best cd of all time Illmatic

[Hook][Intro]

[Hook][Hook: 2X]
The coolest guys around the town
Everybody come and gather around
Me and Mike are here to stay
We make these rap songs every day

[Verse 1]
You're mad cause your girlfriend wants to hold my hand
I could go like this and hit you with a rubber band
Now I think I'll go and ask your girlfriend on a date
I'll pick her up at seven, and I won't be late
And then I'll probably blow her a kiss
Have you ever seen me do it? It goes like this
Kiss your hand, and blow the kiss away
She maybe didn't tell you, but I kiss her every day
I learned this move in my karate class
Try and pay attention cause I'm gonna do it fast
Right punch, left punch, kick, and spin
Now go home and practice, and show it to your friends
I can run one mile in seven minutes flat
I even got a ribbon; I bet you like that
It's a first place ribbon; that's why it's blue
If you go home and practice, you can get one, too

[Hook: 2X]

[Verse 2]
I could shoot a shot as good as Michael Jordan
My favorite NBA player is Michael Jordan
My other favorite NBA player is Kobe Bryant
When he jumps in the air, he goes flyin'
Someday I want to rap like Eminem
"Lose Yourself" is my favorite song by Eminem
You can even ask Mike--I know all of the words
It's probably the best song that I've ever heard
Everybody knows that I have no fear
And guess what? Last year I caught three deer
So what do you think about that
My name is Krispy Kreme, and I really like to rap
And I know how to cook some real good chicken
Have you ever tried it? That stuff is finger lickin'
It's so darn good; it tastes so sweet
I like to eat chicken every single week

[Hook: 2X]

Peace![Intro]
Froggy Fresh, and Money Maker Mike, and Denzel Washington

[Hook x2]
I said he's Denzel Washington, the best actor ever
He's so darn cool, he's so darn clever
I think that you're the man, and Mike does too
Denzel, if you want, you can join our crew

[Verse 1]
I remember when I first seen the movie John Q
His son needed a heart, he knew what he had to do
He went up in the hospital and said: "Here's the deal
My name's Denzel, and I always keep it real
My son needs a heart, so you better get one fast
And if you do not hurry up, I will kick your freakin' butt."
And guess what happened? His son got a heart
I knew that he could do it cause Denzel is really smart
And how could you ever forget Man on Fire
If you say it's not a good movie, then you're a liar
Let me tell you why Denzel is a superstar
He left the CIA to be a little girl's bodyguard
The girl got stolen, all we could do is pray
But once again Denzel comes to save the day
He gave his own life in exchange for the girl's
If you ain't heard about my homeboy Denzel he's out of this world

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
And how could you forget The Book of Eli
Where Denzel played the superhero blind guy
It was kind of sad cause everyone was bad
Denzel was the only good guy the world had
He had to hide the Bible from the thieves and the crooks
But then at the end Carnegie stole the book
You thought Denzel had lost and you were like "Dang"
But guess what? Eli memorized the whole thing
Did you forget about The Titans? Do you Remember The Titans?
With his back against the wall, Denzel just keeps on fighting
Coach Boone is the new head coach in town
They tried to make him leave, but Denzel ain't no clown
And once again Denzel comes to save the day
He earned the team's respect and he taught them boys to play
With Julius Campbell and Gerry Bertier you better cheer
Because they won the championship on that year

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Froggy Fresh]
Out on the court for a game of two on two
Me and Mike versus James and his boy Big Blue
We headed off to Kevin's house right after school
Cause he got that new lifetime basketball hoop
We came ready, we came ready to play
We came ready to win and bring the trophy home that day
Big Blue said you ain't bringin' home that W
How you gon' score when I'm standin' here in front of you
I grabbed the ball and I passed it into Mike
Mike caught the pass faked left and went right
He drove through the lane and he threw it off the glass

Nobody could believe it James fell over on the ground
He started cryin' put his hands in his head
Then Big Blue looked at me and Mike, then he said

[Hook: Froggy Fresh]
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Verse 2: Froggy Fresh]
James was mad, I could see it in his eyes
James never gets dunked on and James don’t ever cry
He stood up, beat his fist on his chest
Looked at me and Mike and ran his thumb across his neck
He grabbed the ball, squared up to the hoop
Took a hard right step and then he slipped in dog poop
Me and Mike started laughin' and he deserved it too
For the rest of the day we called him Captain Poopy Shoe

Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Verse 3: Froggy Fresh]
For the rest of the game, the lead went back and forth
It was all tied up when I checked the scoreboard
There was only 10 seconds left on the clock
James went in for a layup but his shot got blocked
And then juked out Big Blue

That’s how me and Mike won the basketball game
We beat Big Blue and Big Bad James
Cause me and Mike are the number one team
And we heard James cry and we heard his mom scream
She said…

[Hook]
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on

Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Outro: Froggy Fresh]
Yeah, you come up in here you’re gonna get dunked on
Peyton and Kemp
Penny and Shaq
Pippen and Jordan
Boy, me and Mike are bad
Hey![Intro]
All I could do was wonder
Wonder if I was ever gonna see Mike again
Wonder why bad things always happen to good people
And I wondered why I didn't keep my promise to Mike
Cuz I told Mike that I was always gonna be there for 'em
And when Mike needed me most, I abandoned him
I shoulda been on that bus with Mike and I knew it
But there was nothin' I could do about it now

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here with this shirt in my hand
A feeling I can't stand, I'm 'bout to lose my best man
Me and Mike, been partners since the start
And now a bully's about to tear us apart
And these thoughts keep runnin' through my head
Is Mike alive? Is Mike dead?
Is Mike gone? Did Mike go to heaven?
I'm nervous, I head up to the Seven-Eleven
I'm restless, I'm out of control
Don't understand how one man could take another man's soul
Is it my fault? Should I blame myself?
Did I get Mike killed tryin' to save myself?
I stare into space
I'm losin' my mind, I'm losin' the race
I'm fallin' behind, I'm blind , It's like I can't see
Who's gonna watch my back when there's only just me?

[Hook] (x2)
Please Mike, don't go
Why is it that the good die young and the bad die old?
God, please help Mike
Don't let him die tonight cause it just ain't right

[Verse 2]
I peek into his room and see the nurse come over
Then I recognize her face, I feel like I know her
I've seen her somewhere, My mind starts racin'
I can't figure it out and I'm losing my patience
Then bam! It hits me like a bomb
The nurse, It's her, That's James' mom
Before I can even blink, She covers up his mouth
And covers up his nose, Now Mike is passin' out
And I bust into the room, And push her out of the way
I'm at a loss for words, I don't know what to say
I shake Mike, I'm screamin' his name
Wake up! Wake up, Mike! I'm goin' insane!
Then his eyes open up, And he jumps out of bed
I scream, "Thank you god!" Cause Mike's not dead
We bolt for the door and head out into the night
We haven't won the war yet but we won the fight

[Hook]I scrape, I crawl, I bleed for this
I fight, I brawl, I feind for this I feed on this
I show no signs of weaknesses, I hate the hedonist
I love nights full of sleeplessness

I call suffering my brother, I love him like my mother
We look out for each other, we'd die for one another
I fight, I brawl, I feind for this
I scrape, I crawl, I bleed for this

Hearts gone, march on, our lives are par 1
Kids learn to draw guns, before they learn to draw the sun
Emotionless, an orphanage that's full of carcasses
Where feinds score morphine, horror scenes and heartlessness

Pallbearers carry only sons, loved ones hang their heads
Best friends could make your bed
Turn a blind eye or catch a blind side when they drive by
Not mine they scream, not mine, then they pop 9's

Impossible, it's impossible they say
I pray to make it work but only Satan listens when I pray
I wish you well, but wishes don't come true
You could throw a brick of gold into a wishing well

I wish you well, living sinful inside of a prison cell
Cell-mates put you in checkmate and shove shanks right through your breastplate
And rest assured they won't hesitate
Until you hesitate to respirate, terrorize, suffocate

I scrape, I crawl, I bleed for this
I fight I brawl I feind for this I feed on this
I show no signs of weaknesses, I hate the hedonist
I love nights full of sleeplessness

I call suffering my brother. I love him like my mother
We look out for each other, we'd die for one another
I fight, I brawl, I feind for this
I scrape, I crawl, I bleed for this

Sentimental will leave you mental
Cause nowadays only the lives of the menace are monumental, bloody shirts
The spindle spins red thread into a web
Until the bodies pile up a mile up above your heads

And the webs are full of black widows
Who try and end you with their riddles, Try and keep you in the middle
Til your bones are dry and brittle
You battle. broken and lonesome, until they tear your body open

It could make you, it could break you
Prides roam the streets
Roaring lions seek and devour for power
They'll put you to sleep

His eyes on the sheep
He lies in the heat
No retreat
He loves to greet the fetus of the weak

His children tell them
Bring us something sweet
Bring us white bring us light-skinned bring us dark meat

Young boys with sharp ears
Train with steel spears
It's real here
Someone better kill for a meal here

I scrape, I crawl, I bleed for this
I fight I brawl I feind for this I feed on this
I show no signs of weaknesses, I hate the hedonist
I love nights full of sleeplessness

I call suffering my brother. I love him like my mother
We look out for each other, we'd die for one another
I fight, I brawl, I feind for this
I scrape, I crawl, I bleed for this[Verse 1]
Friday the 13th, walking out of school
Me and Mike is trying to come up with something to do
We can go TP, we can watch movies
We can turn the bad channel on and see boobies
Mike, we do the same thing every week
By 9:15 I'm so bored I fall asleep
We ain't playing Halo, we ain't playing Joust
We pay a visit to the Vorhees' house
That last name got Mike's heart racing
Said "Wait a minute, that's the house of Jason
Oh no, no I ain't doing that
Are you going crazy? You must be going mad
You know what's gonna happen if we step into that house
Two of us go in and none of us come out"
But I convinced him, it wasn't very hard
He said that he'd go if I gave him my Charizard

[Hook] x2
Some people say that the whole thing's true
Other people say if you believe it, you're a fool
And Friday's the best day of the week
But not when it's Friday the 13th

[Verse 2]
I grabbed some garlic, I grabbed a cross
A jug of holy water, and a tube of lip gloss
Mike said "Dude, why are you bringing all this crap
Jason's not a vampire, put that stuff back
Hold up, let me see that lip gloss first
Mmm what is that? Is that berry burst?
This tastes good, you think that I can keep it?"
I says "Long as I can use it when I need it"
I grabbed my hat, my backpack, and my sword
Mike grabbed his house keys, we headed out the door
Mike said "Buddy, let's try to make this fast
Follow me, I know exactly where his house is at"
Mike stopped and he pointed at the crib
And said "That's the house where Jason Vorhees lives"
I crept up real quiet like a mouse
Then bam, Jason came busting out the house

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
We were running, we were running for our lives
We were more than just scared, we were freaking terrified
I was beatonized, bout to die from exhaustion
I looked back, Jason wasn't there, we must've lost him
We were getting tired so we stopped at a pavilion
I looked up and saw a skeleton hanging from the ceiling
I said "Mike what kind of place is this?
He's gon' kill us out here and there won't even be a witness"
Suddenly, Jason came stumbling up the trail
But he was looking rough, he was moving like a snail
He dropped to his knees and fell over face first
Hockey mask in the dirt, yo it look liked it hurt
Mike said "Dude, did Jason die bro?"
I replied "Mike, how should I know?"
Mike said "Ain't nobody gonna believe this"
I said "They gon' believe it when they see the freaking pics"

[Hook] x2[Hook]
So long, so long
I keep thinking that my friend's gone for good
I need a shoulder I can lean on, but he's gone
And now I'm all alone, all alone

[Verse 1]
I miss Mike, I ain't seen him in a long time
I wanna high five, hear him spit a new rhyme
Last I heard, he ain't doing too fine
Cause that fun trip got him going out his mind
Fun trip is the new stuff James been dealing
One lil hit got you bouncing off the ceiling
Now James got my homeboy hooked
The way it's messing Mike up got me shook
All the clothes and the whips and the clips
And the guns and the money and the drugs
And the honeys and the thugs
The same guys he said he would never run with
But now he's addicted to the fun trip
Thing is, Mike really ain't a bad guy
He was doing bad things just to get a quick high
He got a taste to the money and the power
Ain't no high like that soft blue powder

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I seen Mike and James out in the streets
Boom box on his shoulder, head bopping to the beat
I said "Steve, what's up homie"
He said "Yo dog, long time no see"
I said "Steve, why you running around with James?
You know that life is only gonna bring you pain"
He said "Cause James gets the trip at a low price
Buddy you're just jealous I'm living the good life"
I said "The good life, Steve, this isn't it
That stuff ain't good for you Steve, you gotta quit"
He said "Get out my face before I hit you in the lip"
But that wasn't Mike talking, no way, that was the trip
I watched him drive away with James
In the whip with the clips and them big gold chains
I knew with James, he would probably make a million
But that fun trip, it was gonna kill him

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Days went past, weeks went past
I knew he wouldn't last, things are moving too fast
I called and called but I never got through
It's like I want to do something but I don't know what to do
How could you go and throw it all away
I don't know what to say, you got me worried every day
Worried about if you gonna make it through the night
And all that I could do is watch it take over your life
That stuff is gonna crush you, I hate you and I love you
Think about how your momma's looking down from above you
Think about what she'd think Mike, think about what she'd feel
I can't believe this is happening, I can't believe it's real
I can't believe there's nothing I can do to bring him back
I can't believe it Mike, I gave you everything I have
We made a promise to each other, one brother to another
We'd never leave each other, we put that on our mothers

[Hook][Verse 1]
As soon as I take a step inside the club
I run up to my boys and my homies show me love
Cuz you know how we do, we always go hard
I'll die for my boys before I ever let 'em starve

We always eat good, cuz we work so hard
We grind so hard. We've come so far
We will not stop. We will not quit
When they count us out, we 'gon drop another hit

I said I see you on that dance floor, just do it
I wanna see you dance more, just move it
Glide and slide from side to side
Dance, just dance, just dance away the night

[Hook: 2X]
Ooooh, girl work it. Work that thing
I'm bout to make it rain, cuz you're driving me insane
I like the way you move, I like the way you groove
Get out on that dance floor, girl your so smooth, I said

[Verse 2]
If you want girl, we can leave the club soon
Go out to the beach, dance underneath the moon
Girl watcha think, do you wanna be my wife?
Don't make me ask twice, cuz I love you more than life

Can't no other girl shake it like you
I really can't wait girl I wanna wife you
Check out that ring girl, put it on your finger
I'll sing you a song cuz I'm a real good singer

And I'll just sit here and watch you dance
Run across the beach while I hold your hand
I'll spin you around girl, let's get down girl
You always make me smile girl, you never make me frown

[Hook: 2X]

[Verse 3]
2X:
Pretty little thing from Tennessee, I like you and you like me
Girl I wanna give you my heart they can't keep us apart
Pretty little thing from Tennessee, I like you and you like me
Girl I wanna give you my time, can't get you off my mind

You ain't gonna find another man like me
Another girl like you, that's unlikely
Cuz we're one of a kind, I wanna give you all my time
No matter how hard I try, I can't get you outta my mind

[Hook: 2X]

[Bridge:]
Krispy Kreme . . . and Money Maker Mike. Back with another hit
A song for the ladies. You ready?

[Hook: 2X]

Peace OutIntro

Krispy Kreme
And Money maker Mike, of course

Chorus X2

Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more

Verse 1

It was October 31st
Me and Mike have walked 10 miles and we were dying of thirst
Then all of a sudden we remembered about the curse
It was the curse of the Birmingham hearse
On this very night, 20 years ago
A big black hearse went spinning off the road
For no good reason it blew all 4 tires
And guess who was inside it..Mike Myers
We heard stories but we knew they werent true
Scary, but it never happened to us
We werent afraid, we were way too tough
Was it a monster? Was it James and his boys?
Then Mike Myers came busting out the bush
We got up on the bike, I screamed push Mike, push

Chorus X2

Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more

Verse 2

Mike pedaled fast but it wasnt fast enough
He knocked us down and we both went flying
The candy sprayed everywhere and Mike started crying
Forget the candy Mike, go and grab your stinking bike
Plus we got a bunch of candy I dont even really like
We pedaled and pedaled, it felt like forever
He said it'd never happen, well..never say never
The bike swerved, the bike crashed
And then we both got covered in trash
And right before our heads are bout to get hacked off
Mike Myers takes his mask off

Chorus X2

Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more[Hook] x2
I ain't going home without my candy and my homie
Punk you're soft as macaroni
I don't think you really know me, homie

[Verse 1]
Me and Mike hit the street with the mean sweet tooth
We were dressed to a T in our Halloween suits
Dad said we had to be home before 8
But me and Mike decided we were staying out late
It was nine pm, mom was calling me again
I said "Mike, don't she understand we're grown men?"
Then I ran into his chest and my brain felt pain
You already know his name, it's that dumb jerk James
I stepped back and I waive my light saber
And James pointed over at my pack of Lightsavers
I said "No, James, you ain't getting those
And if you try to take them, I will break your freaking nose
Quit playing James, I ain't even scared"
Mike said "That ain't James, bro. James is over there"
I said "You're right, and there's Big Blue
So if that's them, then who are you?"

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
We ran up the street and we came across a bus
We climbed up in and I pulled the door shut
We walked to the front and we peeked out of the window
Nothing but the black night, no sign of the sicko
Then suddenly I seen him, he was gonna spill our guts
I was praying for my life as he walked past the bus
But then my light saber fell over right next to me
Crash on the ground and it lit up like a Christmas tree
It was so bright lying on the ground
Mike Myers must have heard it cause he stopped and turned around
He walked over and he peeped through the door
And seen my light saber shining brightly on the floor
Then me and Mike heard the door open
We were filled up with so much fear, we were frozen
Then Mike Myers climbed up onto the bus
Me and Mike were both trapped, he was gonna butcher us

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
At the very last second, we escaped from the bus
Then we ran up to the school but the doors were locked shut
I told Mike hurry, go and get some help
I'll be fine here on my own, I can fight this dude myself
Then my homeboy Mike ran out into the night
I told Mike Myers dog, you ain't very bright
Don't you know that you're messing with your life
You don't bring no knife to a light saber fight
Then I knocked that big ole knife right out his hand
I can't even lie, I was feeling like the man
Then he pulled a light saber right out of his cuppered alls
Swung it against my arm and he cut it clean off
I couldn't believe it, my hand was on the ground
I needed a hand and nobody was around
My last thought as he choked me up against the door
Only one way out, I gotta use the force

[Hook] x2[Intro]
Hey everybody it's Krispy Kreme
And I'm back on another track
This one's for the club

[Verse 1]
I've been shot about 500 times
And I've done about 1 million crimes
I killed a great white shark
I knocked out his teeth, and I ripped out his heart
Talk crap and I'll give you a scar
Talk crap I'll throw eggs at your car
I'll cut holes in your tires
I'll put poop on your porch and I'll light it on fire

[Hook]
Yeah, said everybody wants to be me
The only problem is they can't even see me
Ball so hard record labels wanna sign me
Life is a race and everybody's behind me

[Verse 2]
Everybody gets scared when I front flip
If you come around here then you're done with
Have you ever been to the county fair?
I rode the Fireball and I wasn't even scared
I got swallowed by an anaconda snake
Then I told him, "You just made a big mistake."
Cause all I had to do was go like this
And just like that, I killed him with my fist

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And everybody's behind me
And everybody's behind me
Life is a race and everybody's behind me
(Ahh!) Alright, let's go

[Outro]
Everybody on the left put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody on the right put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody in the back put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody up front put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreeeeeeme!"
Yeah! Krispy Kreme!
Yeah, that's for all the haters, and that's for all my fans
West side!
We out, peace!They say that love will find you when you least expect it
I never thought I'd see the day I'd find someone so precious
When I sit down to write, I see you on every page
I could stare at you for days, you could make me change my ways
I tell you I'm gon' make a way, then you fade away
Now I'm sittin' here at home alone with 50 Shades of Grey.
And all I can think about is you
So tell me why I feel your breath on my neck; I'm all alone in this room
But it's like I...knew from the start you was gon' hurt me
You was gon' love me and then leave me and desert me
So who else can I blame but myself?
Got nothin' but this picture of your face on my shelf
Maybe I'm not a man, maybe there's something wrong with me
Wish I could find the reason you don't wanna write a song for me
Wish I could find the reason why I'm stuck on you
Wish I could find the reason why I can't break through

Cuz girl I don't just love you, I live for you
And there ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't give for you
You got my heart locked up and I can't get free
Cuz I love this girl, but she don't love me
Said girl I don't just love you, I live for you
And there ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't give for you
You got my heart locked up, and I can't break free
Cuz I love this girl, but she don't love me

Why do I always fall in love? Boys ain't supposed to fall in love
Boys are supposed to hook up with some random girl up in the club
Boys are supposed to brag about the girls that they tricked
And boys are supposed to laugh about the hearts that they rip
Why do I love deep? And why can't I sleep?
And why is there only just me in these sheets?
And why do I miss you? Girl why do I miss you?
I'm a grown man; Why do I got this box of tissues?
I swear to God if it's the last thing that I do
I'mma kiss you on the cheek and I'll fall asleep next to you
Cuz when I find something that I want I always get it
Girl if I had a genie you'd be all three wishes
But now you had me, and you say you don't want me
I try not to think, but these memories just haunt me
Maybe you're right, maybe it ain't gonna work
Maybe every time I fall in love I'm gonna end up hurt

Cuz girl I don't just love you, I live for you
And there ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't give for you
You got my heart locked up, and I can't get free
Cuz I love this girl, but she don't love me
Said girl I don't just love you, I live for you
And there ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't give for you
You got my heart locked up, and I can't break free
Cuz I love this girl, but she don't love me

And now I see your face inside of every other girl's face
Got everyone concerned cuz I just stare out into space
And pray about you, and think about you
But they don't understand there's something about you
Because you're different. You're one in a million
Now I lay down on the floor and I just stare up at the ceiling
And I just pray, yea I just pray to cupid
Go pay this girl a visit, I know it sounds so stupid
But I can't live without her, and I can't be alone
And I can't take another day without us speaking on the phone
And I can't take another day without my hand inside of hers
I just can't take another day, I pray to God just make it work
Why would You show me something I could never have?
You give her to me then I fall in love, and then you take her back
What kind of life is this? Why is it so haunting?
The girl I can't have is the girl I keep wanting

Cuz girl I don't just love you, I live for you
And there ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't give for you
You got my heart locked up, and I can't get free
Cuz I love this girl, but she don't love me
Said girl I don't just love you, I live for you
And there ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't give for you
You got my heart locked up, and I can't break free
Cuz I love this girl but she don't love me
Said girl I don't just love you, I live for you
And there ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't give for you
You got my heart locked up, and I can't get free
Cuz I love this girl but she don't love me
Said girl I don't just love you, I live for you
And there ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't give for you
You got my heart locked up, and I can't break free
Cuz I love this girl but she don't love me[Intro]
Froggy Fresh
And Money Maker Mike
And Gator Jones
And Jimmy Butler
This is for the Bulls

[Hook x2]
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout that man, Jimmy Butler
Put the whooping on the Cavs, they's imposters
I ain't gon' lie, LeBron, you's a baller
But Jimmy Butler is your father

[Verse 1]
The end of the 2010 season
Cav's fans nervous, cause they knew LeBron was leavin'
And he did, took his talents down to South Beach
Built that Frankenstein team and won a couple rings
Dang Cleveland, tell me what the heck is that?
First you burn the dude's jerseys then you buy him back?
LeBron left you like a hot girl in high school
Then when the Heat broke up, you took him back, fool
Do you smell that?
Something smell like desperation
But the Bulls, they been sitting back and steady, waitin'
Yeah, they been through the trials and the tribulations
Look at all the injuries Derrick's been facin'
Cleveland beggin' 'Bron to win a ring
With that brand new Frankenstein team
Give it three years, bet you if he doesn't win
Then Cleveland gonna burn his jerseys once again

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Jimmy hit 'em with that lockdown defense
LeBron twice his size, but Jimmy's straight beastin'
LeBron's stressed Jimmy gonna give him grey hair
What you talkin' 'bout, LeBron's hair ain't there
LeBron out here spraying hair out of a can
C'mon, LeBron, dude, shave your head man
Jordan shaved his head back in '89
Your hair's fallin' back, where you goin' draw the line?
And your bigs can't handle Pau in the post
You give him room, he'll pop a jumper from the free throw
And you know I love my big homie, Joakim
I ain't gon' lie, homeboy, I love the whole team
Happy Mother's Day, LeBron, hope you having fun
Happy Father's Day, Lebron, cause you're Jimmy's son
Now the Cav's all 'bout to get slaughtered
Cause Jimmy Butler is your father

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Yeah
Froggy Fresh
Money Maker Mike, Gator Jones, Jimmy Butler
And all the Bulls
Let's go, Bulls[Intro - Krispy Kreme]
So, you know, late one night
I was sitting in my room alone
And, you know what?
How about you just listen to the song?
Stroke It, Up and Down, Left and Right
This is for all the parents who told me
Don't do it, never do it
You know what? I'm doin it, all the time

[Verse 1 - Krispy Kreme]
It was all a dream, a wet dream that is
It was all fun until I woke up covered in jizz
In my head or on the computer, porn don't change
Shyla Styles, Jayden porn don't change
Shyla Styles, Jayden James
Man fucks MILF in the back of a car
Oh how I'd love to be a porn star
With a dildo the girl gets wet
Low budget pornos are the motherfucking best
Web browser of choice - Incognito Chrome
Internet equals big tits and good dome
Xvids.com, motherfucking redtube
Hell google images even shows hoes nude
44F, 32D
I'm all about the tits but that's just me
And I got one site that's the best of the rest
I love whacking off to chat roulette
Good or bad, fuck it, it's all good
All I want to do is beat my wood
And If you don't whack it, then you gay, faggot

[Verse 2 - Tha Assassin]
Kinda getting bored of that same old shit
Slutty ass ho with big old tits
So now I got a thing for the old ladies
And I only watch porn if the bitch is over 80
I like the saggy tits and the wrinkly butt
I bet you ain't never seen a 90 year-old slut
She's grunting but it's probably from arthritis pain
And her vagina's wide enough to fit a fucking train
Sexy grandmas, fully nude
So I click on it and see them drenched in juice of the prune
Lesbian GILFS, getting all wet
Fucking each other call it antique sex
Cause there's something special about a broad
Who's way past the stage of menopause
Sexy orgy in a nursing home
Got no teeth, straight gums when the dick gets blown
You can't blame me for liking a gray beaver
Old lady porn, yeah I'm a believer
And if you don't whack it, you gay faggot

[Verse 3 - Yola Mayne]
Me myself, I'm an ass man
I like them big booty bitches
Yeah I'm into that shit
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
That's what I used to to before I found my dick
50 inch screen that's filled with tits
Close my eyes, look back, now it's clit
Yeah, I wish this was my life
But now all I do is stroke on the pipe
Get some vaseline then lube it all up
If I use enough, it's like my dick's getting sucked
Yeah, gotta use imagination
Uh, then you build anticipation
With that vertical sensation
Before you reach your destination
Woosh, and out I flow
Speed it up and it's go, go, go
It's so fine, I don't need a bitch
Cause whenever I get that itch
I can JACK IT, and it's all good
Ain't no ho gonna touch this wood
And if you don't whack it, then you gay, faggot

[Verse 4 - Lil Clip]
Fuck having sex, all I need is a laptop
Porn every hour, pants down let my dick flop
I do it in public, at crossroads mall
While I stroke my dick, I put Tobasco on my balls
Bu-cocky or gangbang, I like that freaky shit
Especially when the girl's got a piercing on her clit
My favorite site is fucking bang bros
MILFs, lesbians and teenage hoes
Threesomes, blowjobs and double penetration
Ebony, redheads and chicky-eyed asians
Dildos, fisting give me that sensation
Cumshots, cream pies and ejaculation
Handjobs, oral and fucking masterbation
Online porn is man's best creation

[Outro - Lil Clip]
Now I was supposed to write 18 fucking bars on this
But I watched porn instead
Fap, fap, fap[Intro]
Krispy Kreme, and Daniel Tosh
Diamond Style Productions
And this a song for the television

[Verse 1]
Chilling in the kitchen eating peanut butter jelly
When my homeboy Daniel Tosh call me on the cellie
He said "Hey Krispy, you're coming out to Cali
I got some cute girls and there's one named Sally"
I got up on the airplane and headed for the airport
I said: "Daniel Tosh, you know what I'm there for
I'm there for all the women and the fame"
And Daniel Tosh said: "I'm there for the same thing"

[Hook] (x2)
It's me and Daniel Tosh and we're chilling in LA
Doing pushups and getting girls all day
Yeah we're never ever going back home
Cause now we're best friends and we'll never be alone

[Bridge]
Break it down
Daniel Tosh break it down
And Krispy Kreme break it down
Yeah just break it down

[Verse 2]
Got up in the party, there were girls everywhere
They asked if they can kiss me, I said sure, I don't care
But then I looked over and my homie's all alone
I walked over to Daniel and said what's the matter bro?
He said damn Krispy, I'm just not very smooth
But maybe someday I could touch a girl's boobs
I said you and you come over here and hold his hand
Then Daniel Tosh said thanks Krispy, you're the man

[Hook]

[Outro]
Peace[Verse 1]
Mike picked up the phone
Just like every other night Mike had to go home
But this time something felt strange
I can see it in his eyes, I can feel Mike's pain
He leaned over with his hands on his head
He screamed real loud til his face turned red
He took a deep breath, he paused and said
'My mom, she's dead.'
A robber thought nobody was home
But Mike's mom was there alone
The robber fired six shots from his gun
And she didn't have time to call 911
An eyewitness was there on the scene
And you're not gonna believe who she's seen
Mike nearly passed out when she gave the man's name
It was him, it was James!

[Hook]
I can see it in his face, I can see it in his eyes
Mike be strong, Mike don't cry
Mike hold on, Mike don't do it
Mike was gonna kill him, and everybody knew it

I can hear it in his voice, I can hear it in his cries
Mike don't go, Mike you're gonna die
Mike just stop, please, Mike, please
But he wasn't gonna stop 'til he made James bleed

[Verse 2]
He grabbed his gun and headed for the bus-stop
Then he waited out in the front of the gas-stop
And he got right up on the bus
He was a good guy, but he sure was nuts
I gave Mike my last farewell
Where he was headed he would not tell
I asked god to protect him
And if he died I asked heaven to accept him
Then Mike crawled out into the night
I told myself 'I hope I'm not right.'
But I don't think he'll come back
Unless It's in a casket wearing all black
I felt helpless, there's nothing I can do
And I ain't ever walked a mile in his shoes
But I knew that this was bad news
I was about to loose the most important member of my crew

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I heard about how it all went down
In the middle of the woods with nobody around
Mike and James with their finger on the trigger
Violence will only make your problem even bigger
James fired three shots into the night
Before Mike even had James in his sight
That's how it all went down
Violence is only gonna put you to the ground

[Hook]
I can see it in his face, I can see it in his eyes
Mike be strong, Mike don't cry
Mike hold on, Mike don't do it
Mike was gonna kill him, and everybody knew it

I can hear it in his voice, I can hear it in his cries
Mike don't go, Mike you're gonna die
Mike just stop, please, Mike, please
But he wasn't gonna stop 'til he made James bleed    [Verse 1]
I had a dream that my best friend died
He was laying on the couch as he closed both of his eyes
And I just sat and stared ahead trying not to cry
And all that I could say was "I tried mama, I tried"
And when I walked on over to him to pay my last respects
He opened up his eyes like he had risen from the dead
He said "Why didn't you save me? Why didn't you take me
And bring me home and get me clean? Why didn't you make me?"
What could I say to that? I couldn't say a thing
I seen all the pain inside his eyes, I could've stopped that pain
I could've grabbed him by his collar, dragged him through the streets
And kept him locked up all alone inside a room for weeks
If I loved Mike, that's exactly what I would've done
If I loved him like a brother, if I loved him like a son
I'da gave my own life, just to save his
Without the love of another man an addict can't quit

[Chorus: Megan Davies]
Push me over the edge now, to the place where demons lay, yeah
Push me over the edge now, only one step away (x2)

[Verse 2]
I'm not a coward, I've never been afraid
In fact I can't even wait until I see my last day
But as long as I'm alive, if my friend ain't by my side
There ain't no doubt inside my twisted mind that I would rather die
And what is life, what is life without someone to love?
Without someone to stand by, without someone to hug?
It ain't nothing, it ain't nothing worth living
I wish that I could say it was, but it just isn't
I left the house with one thought on my mind
No matter what it takes I ain't gon leave my friend behind
I gotta save his life, even if I lose my own
I don't wanna be alone, I just gotta bring him home
I grabbed my bike and rode it straight across town
Heard everybody whispering "It's bout to go down"
I pulled up to the house but there was men blocking the door
I reached behind my back and said "Lucky I brought my sword"

[Chorus: Megan Davies]

[Verse 3]
I made my way into the house, Mike was laying on the couch
I could still see the blue powder all around his mouth
James ran into the room, bullets fired from his clip
But I didn't get hit, because I deflected em quick
James threw the gun and I cut the gun in half
And when he turned to run I ran the sword across his calf
He fell down on the floor, I said "Lay there, and stay there!
These things you do to me and Mike, James, you know it ain't fair!
You're lucky I don't kill you right here, right now
If you don't wanna die today you better stay down on the ground!"
I grabbed Mike by his shirt, made sure he wasn't hurt
Mike weighed more than me, but it was time to put in work
I threw him in the wagon, brought him back to the crib
I locked him in a room and said "Mike, you're gonna live!"
Withdrawal's the most painful thing I had ever seen
But in less than two weeks I had my homeboy clean

[Chorus: Megan Davies][Hook]
I've been waiting for these gifts, I've been waiting all year long
But when I woke up to sneak a peek, all the presents were all gone
Now I ain't one to make a fuss but Christmas ain't the same
When that old boy James, James, James playing reindeer games

[Verse 1]
It was the night before Christmas, me and Mike couldn't sleep
We stayed up guessing about our presents cause we weren't allowed to peek
But we ain't very patient and we couldn't wait no more
I felt the cool winter chill as my feet hit the floor
We opened up the door and we walked down the hall
But there wasn't any presents, there were no presents at all
I looked over and Mike just started crying
I put my hand on his shoulder and said "It's gonna be fine!"
Don't worry Mike, we're gonna figure this out
We're gonna get the presents back, that's what Christmas is about
See, without present man, Christmas ain't the same"
Mike looked over at me and said "It's gotta be James"
I said "You're right, I should have known
In the middle of the night, he must have broke into our home"
Mike said "Yo, he could be anywhere in town"
I said "I know but we gotta track him down"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Me and Mike headed out on that cold winter night
With the snow shining bright underneath the moonlight
We drew James very best that we could
Taped him up to all the telephone poles in the hood
We stopped at the stores, taped his pictures to doors
It was the middle of the night and we was going on four
Me and Mike was getting cold, the trail was getting cold
By now, been sold or resold
The sun came up, we been searching all night
We searched left, we searched right, it wasn't anywhere in sign
We was getting tired, we was bout to call it quits
Then all of a sudden we got an anonymous tip
The caller said "I see him in the woods behind the school
Hurry cause I think he's got your parents with him too"
Me and Mike headed off to the woods in a rush
We couldn't believe it but sure enough, there he was

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mike fired the sling shot and hit him in the butt cheek
James dropped to his knees and let out a loud shriek
He was dragging a big bag that Big Blue couldn't even lift
Me and Mike ran up and said "Why did you steal our gifts?"
James said "Sorry guys, money's been tight
Winter's been so cold, there ain't nobody riding bikes
When nobody's riding bikes man, there's no bikes to steal
I been going to church to get a nice hot meal"
Mike said "Shut up, James, give us back our presents
I looked at Mike and said "Dog, chill, just wait a second
James is clearly broke and we got a lot of gifts
It ain't gon' kill us just to give him five or six
Then James said "Hey guys, how bout this
I ain't keeping five or six, I'm keeping all your freaking gifts
I pulled my sword out, I was all ready for war
James pulled his magnum out, said  "gon' be sorry"

[Hook]
