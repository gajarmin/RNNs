Your chest is just whatever, I found the buried treasure
Yes ma'am, here's the plan

I've been travelin for some time {*echoes*}
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine {*echoes*}
On these long dark dusty roads {*echoes*}
Lookin there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I left out from mama's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death I still manage livin life
Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, this one is for history
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them B
This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin you 200 times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And 10 million sold in the name of my deliverance

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin' your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin' one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together no one can touch us
It haunts me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin' us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincidence
On my mama, Timmy, baby, we shall have deliverance
So we say

[Hook][Timbaland]
Uhh.. uh-oh, uh-oh
Tch-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka uhh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Tchka-tchka uhh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Say what, say what? Freaky freaky uhh
Tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka Bubba

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Shit I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin chose me
So I hit the track runnin - like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now, but it's much improved
Yo' album droppin this summer? That sucks for you
Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?
So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits
But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you
What you need to do, is just admit you love me
The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin ugly

[Hook]
Uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get uglyyyyyyyyyy, uglyyy, uglyyy
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin bigger, with every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin, spittin that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin that truly matters
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin
Go 'head throw dem bows - fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin
This that new South - take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin legend, and this is gettin ugly

[Hook]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Now this thang is jumpin - ain't it somethin?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets hatin broads clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin to live, you with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin brave then better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin, then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you whylin
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin

[Hook]

[Timbaland]
Ha ha, it's gon' get (uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!)
Thck-thck (Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)
It's gon' get (uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!)
(Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)
It's gon' get (uglyyyyyyyyyy) say what?
(Uglyyy, uglyyy) Say what? (Uglyyy!) In here! Huh, in here!
(It's gon' get uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!)
(Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!)

{*Bubba's "Ugly" beat*} I want you to..

"Holla!! Ain't no stoppin me" -] Missy
"Copywritten so, don't copy me"

C'mon Bubba, let's go[Verse 1]
I don't need this, all I need is us - come on girl let's put it in the wind
I don't care none about no one, if they loved us they should it did it when
They had a chance but now the dance is over and fa sho its our way time
Let the top down, we can't stop now, explain the past - baby I ain't tryin
I ain't lyin, when I say we done came of age and when thangs done changed
Time to spread our wings, fly to better things, pack ya suitcase todays the day
Don't tell ya momma don't tell ya sister it'll only complicate the issue
We'll mail 'em a box of tissues, the only one that loves you is right here with you
Girl don't ever look back, our destiny awaits us
And whatever place we pump the brakes I'll work my hands to the bone n just what it takes to
Give us everything our folks never had, I'm prepared for that
It may take a while but Ima make ya smile forever I said a prayer for that and
I know he's listenin atleast to this one, if you never heard none of the others
This is me and you and Im'a see it through from this highway to under the covers, baby!

[Hook]
Oohhhhh Hoooooo!
I wanna run away with you (I wanna run away, I wanna run away)
I wanna run away with you (cuz baby your my everything)
I wanna run away with you (I wanna run away, I wanna run away)
I wanna run away with you (cuz baby your my everything)

[Verse 2]
We got off the exit in Waco, Frankie J was on the radio
I asked her was she afraid to go all the way with this, she delayed to know
I said baby I just need to know, if you ain't down we can turn around
Your happiness is my happiness and thats the only thing thats concernin me now
Just hurt me now, she said "would you please just let me talk for once?"
Then all at once she went in to how she been tryin to prevent this all for months
Not at all because she didn't love me and only me, it's just that she
Had withheld one vital piece of info, she looked up at me
With both eyes full of tears, she said "you remember that day at the clinic?
I went in with the doctor and told you I did it? I wasn't able to go through with it"
No you didn't, how could you? Wait a minute, that makes you what?
3 months and some change, well baby doll that just ain't enough
To derail us cuz see, that just means there's three of us
But answer this, at what point did you think this topic should be discussed?
I don't know whether to cry or smile, but somehow I'm doin both
But this changes nothin, I got 2 babies and I solemnly swear to be true to both, baby!

[Hook]

[Bridge - Frankie J]
I wanna run, wanna run away
There's nothin they can do or say to make us stay
I wanna run, wanna run away
There's nothin they can't do, there's nothin they can't say
I wanna run, wanna run away
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wanna run, wanna run away
I wanna run away, baby

[Archie Eversole]
Ain't no question bout who the best
Macy gon' lay the track and Archie come to do the rest
Step in the way, multiple shots are goin' through ya chest
You must have called Pastor Troy cause boy you is blessed
And I'mma take him out the game y'all
It ain't no thang y'all
You wanna buck, I'll rip you up like a chainsaw
The game's raw, boy please believe it
Keep your bible with you cause you gon' be needin' Jesus
Fiendin' for chart-toppin' hits
And Archie ain't gon' stop droppin' shit
I'mma make a million dollars then stand on the top of it
Rockin' it, till the day I die in this game
Archie with the Phat Boy addin' the fire to the fame

[Hook x2]

[Archie Eversole]
A-T-L we bout that head bustin', we leave you dead cousin
What's up, huh bitch nigga, you said something
If you ready why you stumblin' to the flo' huh
If you ready why you stutterin' I ain't Joe
I'mma show em' why they call us dirty
There is no mercy for playa haters cause he ain't worthy
Heard of me then, Hell naw before, bet you done heard of me now
Atlanta, Georgia where the dirty be found
See I done did this since my younger days
Only 16 but my pockets never underage
So let's get paid, cause I stay ready for it, please
And you is crazy if you think that you ready for me, so who ready now

[Hook x2]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah, yeah
Bubba baby, trouble baby dip my thang, love me, hate me
All in London yellin' Georgia, Europe better suffocate me
Hold it down for country crackers, leave them others up to Shady
Give a damn if silly sisters think I'm good enough then pay me
Tell em' Archie they don't want it, however they can get it
Told em' bout that booty chatter, y'all better go on with it
Infiltrated mainstream, maintainin' the same theme
Polo shirts and pig shit, can't even get them stains clean
Ain't too much I ain't seen in between LaGrange and Athens
Ups and downs, rights and lefts all around me brains are scratchin'
Any how we ready now, the new South has arrived
These savages is finto eat and won't stop till they satisfied

[Hook to fade][Big Boi]
We're back
This is MC extraordinaire
Reporting to you for W-A D-F, generation one television
We here in a remote area
Somewhere way back up in the woods
With members of the elite Dungeon Family
Them boys in there workin' on some shit so fire
I bullshit you not

[Killer Mike]
Ey, welcome to Purple Ribbon, prime-time official
Killer Mike, y'all
Killer kill from the ville, go hard on the rhyme
Like a junkie on powder I go hard every line
I'm a ex-Dope Boi but I still rap low
And I sold more horse than a polo sto'
I'm destined to become a millionaire
Similar to Phil Collins I can feel it in the air
My car change colors like a million airs
Necklace, get reckless and touch my chain
I put it in the air and bust your brain
Any sucker out there tryna' take my cash
Better pray God with him when I catch his ass
Or he gon' lay there dyin' wit' a bullet in his ass

We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Pardon my French but if you give me an inch
I'm a take five kilometres and give it to the commoners
Some dirty white boys and some hoochie black girls
Nearly one million sold but I'm still in that world
That's why you won't see Bubba, buck head bouncin'
Unless it's the cream and I'm upstairs countin'
You know the type of bread that don't involve accountants
Continuin' the legacy my four fathers founded
We won a lot of battles but the war is still ragin'
She's turned a lot of tricks but the whore is still agein'
What is ? what God gave me for my birthday
You ain't D-F dawg, fuck what your shirt say
Talkin' bout he's undeserving of the blessin's
When truthfully the tat was roomin' them suggestions
New ? clean in the game they ?
We ain't them boys that you can't say earned it

We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all

[Big Boi]
Every now and then, me and my kin, we get to bussin'
Not in the high school football game, I'm talkin' bout rhyme thrustin'
I'm talkin' bout line crushin', somethin's empty bumpin'
On the low straight out the oven like some blueberry muffins
We got the stuffing like some ? or somethin', macaroni, mackalicious
Mack a bitch or a woman, there is a difference
Not if the woman start bitchin', won't get in the kitchen
Male, chauvinistic, nah, ho, you missed it
I'm just kiddin', just playin', I'm just sayin' we humpin' around
Like the ghost of Bobby Brown and Stankonia lingerin' round
We have found proof of sound of our ground
When we've split in two parts, no one can block us now
Maybe top lock but we can't stop, let the great white head be severed
We weathered the storm, with feathers, something we treasure
(Well I never) and you never will, suckered up
The Dungeon Family is here to stay and we don't give a flying fuck

We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Y'all don't know, y'all ain't heard, well here it come again
Bring the rain, blow the wind, and roll the thunder in
We gon' live, we gon' die and everythang between
Y'all the fire, country girl, don't say she ain't a queen
Bubba said it, Bubba meant it, and that's just all it is
He's so south, he's so slow, I hope you fall for this
Me and P-D up in Riley, oh that's a true event
Doing all of them thangs you lames do resent
Y'all ain't foolin' with this (oh), don't even bother with that (oh)
I'm the hardest of these (oh), like my father for that (whoo)
Talkin' slick indirectly as if you really want it
That old boy don't be snappin', it just sound silly don't it
Run and shine up the coast, it's like the early twenties
What you done the whole day I did in thirty minutes
Boy don't run from me, it won't hurt you at all
Bubba walkin' the walk, y'all just learnin' to crawl

They still here, I be damned if they be losing patience
Get yo ass off my porch or else the blues await ya
No more deer, no more geese, we huntin' close minded
Some bitches want some bidness well you can sure find it
The new south is alive and well inside of Bubba
Made his soul hurt in him, don't seem to mind each other
Thank you Lord for the blessings that you bestowed upon
This old boy from down there, I bought a golden pond
See they wanted to hate it, but they learnin' to love it
Timmy check on that fire, don't let it burn in the oven
Drankin' liquor, thankin' quicker that mostly y'all imagine
After this, where's yo crib, I just might call a cabin
On the lake, next to mama, my sister Ginge and them
Have 'em sayin' Timmy's cracker, yeah we remember him
Come on Betty make it jump I make ya work it wild
Slurp it up, swallow somethin', you get a perfect smile

[Bubba Sparxxx]
But I'm here for the long haul y'all
But that just ain't a fact, naw, naw
Them old boys made her take it all off
You ain't got enough heart, naw, naw
Lose your mind, find your spirit and let your life begin
Say they just drank and smoke, well is you mice or man
We them folks takin' three when y'all was takin' one
Still I don't go to war totin' the naked gun
Please pardon me people, I'm still finding myself
Put on it's been a while, and rewind it to def
Listen closely when I babble cause I done stand the demon
In his eyes, and his smile like I was glad to leave him

A fifth of Beam when you celebrate (That's white thangs)
Poppin five, didn't hesitate (That's white thangs)
Sippin Henn, swervin wood grain (That's black thangs)
But to me, it's just all the same (It's all the same)

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Damn, what a difference a year and a hundred and 12 days makes
Came the longest country mile, thanks to nothin they gave me I made breaks
Basically baby, I've been great, this ain't no recent development
But now it's official, I'm the doo-doo;
And you ain't gon' keep 'em from smellin it
Do you have a speaking impediment bitch, or are you just at a loss for words
Oh-no actually I'm monogomous, all that talk was false you heard
So don't stall betty just slurp, of course I'mma tell you when
Oops my bad that's my mistake, I was just gonna tell you then
I just bought me 5 new Polos, cuz see I'm partial to that logo
That horse is just so Bubba, that means rural like you don't know
Regardless though I'm gon' glow, even in my birthday suit
And when it comes to that soft, yes sir'ee I circle that too
So when you feel it poundin in yo' chest and it causes a slight pain
Just shake it off and smile I got'cha, doin the white thangs ok

I'm outdoors early mo'nin sellin this country crock
Let's get this understood, gotta get me off the top
I got them break down dimes and bomb with twenty-fives on the block
Of that 'naw that hawd, talkin 'bout that glass that straight drop
Bartender, send me Remi, Henny or straight shot
Then see me flee, high speed from eight cops
Leave 'em floored, showin how I'm opposed, y'all can't stop
Jumped the fence, went down the path, came out by Ms. Dot 'partment
Ay, ay Bubba Sparxx shoot we down to the spot
Them young G's up on that corner, done made the porch hot
Them folk say they sweepin, seekin 'He who hold stock'
Ay, run tell shawty, cut off, close shop
I told them boys down there, homes in the van was a NARC
Tell 'em "Naw we don't sell that shit round here doc"
They bout four cars deep, sittin in the Croger parkin lot
But we know when they comin, cuz money bark a lot

[Hook]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm seein more clearly now, how subtle the difference between us might be
Mr. Fat Face got that big weight but still that seem just like me
I'm doin my thing dispite these, little lifestyle expectations
Y'all chose to set for me, shit I'm headed to where my next check waitin

[Backbone]
Look here, beat me I'm old school like LL J beatin off in your Regal
With six eights cross the deck, hittin, sittin on fifteen inch eagles
And Vogues, case closed, order one mo' get drunk, throw bo's
We in here puttin on, all night y'all 'til the place close

Back in the mud again, I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away

[Verse 1]
It's just that country boy, city slick
Hot boy, temperament
Add the pony, add the flame
Either way it's an event
If it's me consider it
Pardon the coincidence, even though they mumble at me
Suckers keep they distances
Father, Kay Hey
What's that they say
Hip hop redneck that's a safe place
Say what makes you comfortable
With me cause I like it here
How about a rural dwelling, urban music pioneer
Turn it up, let it bang
Run with me, I bet you can't
Took too much to make it float
Never will I let it sink
So we reinvented it
Boy are we generous
Hoping that my moment pass
I can see the end of it
25 years of life, I was born yesterday
Loving life, doing right, earning every breath I take
Standing in the mud again, cause it seems to pay me well
Playing with my not so distance cousins from the ATL AHHH..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ah Yea, Ah Yea
Press it up
Ship it out
Call the pony
Rent it out
Everything I Am today
Is what I've really what I've been about
Athens Georgia Resident
Native of Lagrange though
I don't love the Peach State, brothers say it ain't so
Naw, Sir, In Fact it's quite the opposite
Loving yall from Brunswick, Up to the metropolis
Can't forget about my Betty Betty in the ?
That put them triple X's at the end of Andy's Monica
How can I run from, everything that made me
Knowing all the love I get is appreciated greatly
Now witness something truly inconceivable
Bubba International, but still he kept it regional
Trying to make my momma proud
Ricky Lathens see me smile
Gotta make sure this next CD is the fire
Making sure everyone one of my talented associates gets what they deserve
Nothing short that's appropriate YEA!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Get your cup, fill it up
Soda don't appeal to us
But if your broke, do what you can't that alone still enough
Help us out if your rich, cause we about to pitch a bitch
Just stop by the store and grab a case of that, a six of this
Hey Betty get it ready, cause you daddys in route
Let her join the Beat Club, peep that lil trim out
Have her screaming new south, with out pulling loot out
He always wonder what you doing, let him wonder who now
At the end of the day, I will have no regrets
Got it done on every front, and I ain't even focused yet
At the bottom of the pond, swimming with them mud cats
If you dive in I'm perusing for a grudge match
Spell It out L-E-G-E-N-D, I still believe
What ever goal God set for me, indeed I will achieve
Either in this life, for in the next
Whether drinking Gin or Becks
Bubba fin, to bring it home, still you can send a check

[Hook]Uh-uh.. wassup ladies?
Bubba can't forget about y'all..

(Intro)
Hey Betty Betty, hush your mouth, let me tell you something
Hey Betty Betty, this Bubba K, the one your boyfriend bumpin'
He Betty Betty, understand, see I ain't got no patience
Hey Betty Betty, get in the truck, lets crank up these relations

I left yesterday, and I headed straight, up 78, to the A-T-L
These record sales done paid me well, so I'm smoking good, can't you smell?
Life is hell, till you drop a gem, now Bubba got hoes, jocking him
Not cuz he cute, cuz he got that loot, wear Polo suits, and that's hot to them
I see your ass, over at the bar, try your best to fill up that bra
A double-D, sippin' bubbl-y and you'd give your life just to fuck with me
Reluctantly I walk on by, I'm not gon' lie, that Betty fine
But I got to drank, can't even thank, unless I'm tanked, I'm already high
So let it fly, miss Kimberly, I can see right now you into me
Im'a holla at you bout 10 till 3, tryin' to switch from Beam to Hennessey
But you know I can't, so give me Jimmy
And sit right down till the bottles empty
Then we cut, but now shut up, old stupid slut, I stated simply
4 AM, we back in Athens, rollin' balls, and the bitch is laughin'
Chalk the first one, up to rappin'
I waited years, but tonight it happen

(CHORUS)
Hey Betty Betty, hush your mouth, let me tell you something
Hey Betty Betty, this Bubba K, the one your boyfriend bumpin
Hey Betty Betty, understand, see I ain't got no patience
Hey Betty Betty, get in the truck, lets crank up these relations
Hey Betty Betty, I'm tryin' to see if you adventurous
Hey Betty Betty, I only mess with 9's and 10's and up
Hey Betty Betty, you got some things, I'd love to photograph
Hey Betty Betty, you heard a while, but you don't know the half

I missed you Betty, since I last, saw your ass at the Polo Club
What's the matter, can't show no love?
I guess you here bout them photos of, you and me on the internet
Get over there, we ain't finished yet
I got a new, cam-er-a, miss Pam-el-a, and I'm fin to let
Bobby introduce you to the helicopter, and when he through
I bet its clear, why crackers here, ain't trying to hear, another word from you
I'm certain to, attract a virus, cuz using rubbers, don't excite us
If you ain't cutting, don't invite us, and I won't return, if you stole the nighters
Don't deny us, we them boys, talkin' bout you sing with a pretty voice
Just to fuck, and now your buck, all in my face, you made a shitty choice
I get it moist every time I touch it, freaky deaky all out in public
And guess where Mr. Sparxxx erupted?
In her grill, but still, she loved it

(CHORUS)

Now you might see me, ridin' 'Lac, with Rodney Black, on a coochie chase
Or you might catch me with chunky Shan, at some slightly tan, white groupie's place
Then booty shake, Betty's got, a special spot in Bubbas heart
Puttin' cheese to her college degree, but a lot of fleas shake it up for free
If it was up to me, you'd be with me, sippin' Beam, ridin' in between
Lagrange and Athens, if you love me, engrave my name on your nipple ring
I'm spiffy clean, when it comes to females, sex with me only ups your resale
Blazin' quarters, up to ounces, keep the dimes, they done nixed the Sprewell
How that weed smell? Oh I know it, that's how these Georgia crackers grow it
You getting high to every time you blow it, if you feelin' freaky, why won't you show it?
I don't mind, Shan don't mind, Jed don't mind, WE don't mind
But if u scared, get on from here, cuz frankly dear, we don't need your kind

(CHORUS)Its Bubba Sparxx in the streets (2x)

I just hitch hiked my way from Athens to Cascade
Paid homage for three days been written the past eight
I feel I'm the last great warrior of written lyric
You can move to Polo Club bitch you still ain't gettin near it
If its Bubba spittin fear it, this that shit legends made of
It'll take more than a flag for them folks to segregate us
Hook it, let it cake up prepare it for whole sale
This my mother fuckin heart I dont care if it dont sell
I dare you to go tell, your people that Bubbas bogus
Im sorry, did my antics interrupt your fucking focus?
Dammit I guess its hopless, y'all just won't listen
When I'm rhymin to provide you with diamond that dont glisten
I had to be the one, this shit was my birth right
You content with moving units, I'm faced with a worse plight
To give you a verse like, that first hit of extascy
Yeah you special in your click but you ain't shit up next to me
And if you get the best of me, nah, that shit ain't feasable
Cuz trying to get a hold of Bubba is like chasing a greasy bull

Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (C'mon know y'all dont really want it)

Shit these boys dont really want it, the just mumblin to be heard
Damn y'all wasn't lying, sleepy crumblin in some sweet herb
Im humble till my speech slurs, then its off the bleachears
In the closet with your wife enticing her to floss her features
This one 'ot to teach you, it ain't fun to play with Bubba
Took a rich prissy bitch and played her this and made her gutta'
But she made me late for suppa', and I dont eat but once a day
Im tryin to watch my weight cuz my street days a month away
And I want these sluts to love me, but if they dont then fuck 'em
Cuz tomorrow if they swallow, if they won't the I duck 'em
I bet y'all never seen one of me look so clean
Kept it right here in the South and did it with a good ol' team
So hate it if you must, but I made it and you can trust
That every vowel out my bowel, is sacred it just to us
They played it and made a fuss, cuz the truth is a frighten topic
Ricky pull the plug, shit, thats all that might could stop it

Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (C'mon now y'all dont really want it)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (They just mumblin to be heard)

Im through noddin my head to shit, thats anythin but monumental
Can't just settle for La Grange, therefore my slang is continental
From my road to your trap, my code is no dap
If your head is like a keg, chillin ice cold with no tap
Five shows with no nap, I'll sleep when I in the dirt
Ain't tryin to party with you industry faggots I come to work
Emergin from the hurt, that life was and still will be
Took a shower at the dungeon, dried off and was still filthy
These bitches will feel me, I promise just bein honest
Its like its '93 again, got that heat for them premadonnas
Wide eyed in the booth, this goes beyond politics
In other words keep that pussy, I already got a bitch
And I'm pledgin not switch from authentic to counterfeit
Cuz when it comes to that raw, y'all hit it I found the shit
And I won't speak in the dungeon, till its hardway on the wall
In the name of Bubba Sparxx, shit ain't even fair for y'all

Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (C'mon now y'all dont really want it)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (They just mumblin to be heard)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (C'mon now y'all dont really want it)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (They just mumblin to be heard)
The coolest white boy I know
They just mumblin to be heard[Bubba Sparxxx]
I can't do that Timbaland shit, that that shoop shit..

There goes that damn Bubba just bein his country self
Slide inside Timmy's track and ride it 'til nothing's left
Bet you then they'll get the picture, a legendary mixture
Like Jim Beam and Coke, can you cope with that elixir?
Drank it, that'll fix ya, why you angry anyway?
I'm in the same mud as you, been dirty for plenty days
Okay, let's get it on, in any shape form or fashion
At the Tunnel in New York, or at the dorms out in Athens
Y'all still don't hear me? Am I not speakin clearly?
I just throw y'all little lames on any trash heap that's near me
Fuck 'em, hot damn 'em, really, to hell with 'em
Send 'em to Nelly B(?), and certainly they'll get 'em
I really don't have to answer to questions that y'all present me
But I know why after this here session, y'all resent me
Never the one to fuss, just smile and let 'em walk
Okey-dokey, now they knowin how Bubba talk

[Hook: Bubba Sparxxx]
Y'all don't know me a'tall
I say the same thang but slower than y'all
A little Southern charm to top it off
Okey-dokey, dis dat Bubba talk
Y'all don't know me a'tall
I say the same thang but slower than y'all
A little Southern charm to top it off
Okey-dokey - SPIT BOY!

[Bubba Sparxxx]
This time it gets ugly, my folks done got to drankin
Some rednecks and thugs in the club, now what you thankin?
Hopped up and stankin, bankin on Bubba's rise
All up on that Betty you got, with rubber thighs
Can't help but love them guys, they happy they out the country
But the country's still in them, black and nappy, white and grungy
Lawd this boy's gone, from dirty to fast speed
And if she don't visit, we snatchin that rare squeeze
If you mad leave, this is not yo' type of party
Some Jim Beam with gin and Henn with white Bacardi
Yeah we quite retarded but hell you only live once
Still talkin Bubba but I can't complete the sentence

[Hook]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I slowly let my anger turn to just concern
For y'alls well bein, I'm seein there's much to earn
In this money pit of music, this dummy shit's amusin
That's what you think it is? Meet me at the bank with this
I'll withdraw the same two bills and spend it on port (?)
Y'all can't run with me, stay on the porch please
There's somethin special, about Bubba's mannerisms
That's why they should accept, any helpin hand I give 'em
I don't know, is it me, or is this industry foul?
They used to be sugar but they shit to me now
Get in and get bent, that's enough then cut me off
No matter what it cost it's worth it when Bubba talk

[Hook] - repeat 2X[Hook]
I've been travelin for some time {*echoes*}
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine {*echoes*}
On these long dark dusty roads {*echoes*}
Lookin there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I left out from mama's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death I still manage livin life
Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, this one is for history
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them B
This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin you 200 times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And 10 million sold in the name of my deliverance

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin' your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin' one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together no one can touch us
It haunts me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin' us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincidence
On my mama, Timmy, baby, we shall have deliverance
So we say

[Hook]AH!

(*Females voices humming*)

Y'all ready ..
Y'all ready ..
Y'all ready ..

[Verse 1 - Petey Pablo]
One of the illest rhymers that ever came outta Carolina, put this whole shit
On the map
Went back got two states, y'all crammed way to the back
And brought 'em up to the where the rest of 'em at (cause I can do that)
Granddaddy was real strong, daddy was in the Army
I was a bad motherfucker, slightly retarded
Mentally institutionalized, since the age of 5
Buildin tree houses (that the wind couldn't blow down)
Look at me now, holdin it down
Doin it well, I ain't triple platinum yet (but ain't gon' worry 'bout it)
I'm wearin the good damn crown, man I'm the president
And reppin both states (back here in Carolina)
Where the hell did you find 'em? (boy is an animal)
His flow is incredible, style is bananas
I just wanna go to the Grammy's and I don't care if I win
Just to say I've been god dammit (god dammit)

[Hook - Petey Pablo] - 2X

And that way you can ride wit a ... (y'all ready)

Get on dis motorcycle
Get on dis motorcycle
And get your hips on in the big ass truck (y'all ready)

(*motorcycle engine*)

[Verse 2 - Petey Pablo]
From the world of dirt roads, them big ass pot holes
The land of old homes, the land of screen screen doors
Car in the back yard, dog chain tied up
Ain't drove it in years, sittin on nothin
Spit crunk mosquito buckets, hot wood heaters
Hooked up Honda Accord, with house speakers
Bag, phone and beeper, corduroys and sneakers
Pit Spike Lee's and them shell toe Adidas
You don't know shit 'bout Petey (Petey)
Real definition of the greasy, grimy and gritty
You itty bitty bitches sellin drugs for another nigga
Always lookin at me like your trigger finger itchin
I give ya my best witness, when you come to handle your business
You better be ready to get it, cause I don't be bullshittin
I'm up into plastic bottles cause if I keep on feelin the way I'm feelin
I'mma blow up in this motherfucker

[Hook] - 2X - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Twenty-seven dollars to my name, headed up
85 pissy drunk, Petey still made me drive
Left off from LaGrange, passin through Squattenburg
On the way to High Point and my speech startin to slur
Better tell these sons of bitches, boy to move won't allow for me
To stop and say I'm sorry to this dude and this scout
It was just a little bump, shit you dented my Ferrari
Don't call the law, shit is rented, look I'm sorry
All we have done in the name of the south
Gave these ugly motherfuckers somethin to "Raise Up" about
But I'm still unfulfilled, since my daddy still drivin
That fuckin school bus, know that Bubba still strivin
I want me a label, want me a mansion
Timmy can't give it to me, Jimmy ain't spit it to me
Rest assure though, the day is approachin
When these old country boys ain't just playin, they coachin

[Petey Pablo - talking]
Get on dis motorcycle ..
Y'all ready, get on dis motorcycle

(*Female voices humming and motorycle engine continues until end*)[Bubba Sparxxx]
Get your ass up.. get your ass up.. get your ass up..

I hear your car keys jinglin, go 'head and crank it up
Spent a thousand on the liquor but tonight it ain't enough
Cause this town is full of drankers and they all hang with us
Grabbed Betty by the arm, told her man, "Stay in touch"
We takin this one all the way from Athens to Virginia
Hit Timmy for a hundred - that's the last one I'mma lend ya
Ol' girl wanna kick it but she not on my agenda
Did I ever love her? Well, not that I remember
Twerk that, work that, Betty where your purse at?
Snatch daddy's credit cards, here take his shirt back
Where the hell my car at, does anybody know?
If it ain't back in five, everybody gotta go
Ah to hell with it, y'all keep that little Honda
I'm waitin on some Beams from this bitch named Yolanda
Y'all lookin all tired shit I'm just wakin up
By the way when you get up out my bed, make it up

[Hook: repeat 2X]
[T] Boy take that shot [B] I'll take that shot
[T] Girl hit tonight [B] I'll hit tonight
[T] Boy crank this spot [B] I'll crank this spot
[T] Girl get me right [B] I'll get you right

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Aight, get your ass out my bed I'm through playin
You wanna stay the night - what the hell is you sayin?
I ain't tryin to come across to you as inconsiderate
But momma always said if you don't love it then get rid of it
Besides, I got thirty dogs waitin in the yard
They gotta eat too girl, don't make it hard
I'm kinda difficult to understand at first contact
Offered you a beer, don't be expectin much beyond that
Aww shit, y'all quit, I'm winnin
Drownin in a pool of alcohol and I'm swimmin
You wanna play with me but can't last nine innings
Since you wanna chase, what you like, lime, lemon?
I'll make an open challenge tot his whole industry
We can do it with tequila, bourbon gin or Hennessy
Have you butt naked pukin in a purple limousine
I ain't doin shit but drankin do some rappin in between

[Hook]

[Timbaland]
We lit tonight (ain't we)
She gettin right (ain't she)
We ain't gon' stop (is we)
Until we all (dizzy)

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I walked in like a star and I ain't even with Timmy
Stop bein hard, baby girl I give plenty
I seem like a prick cause I got some shit in me
Grab your long johns, boy it's gettin a bit windy
You really wanna know the secret to this white pimpin?
Though I might love 'em, I don't really like women
New the next day and finally the night ended
Lookin back on it that shit was quite splendid

[Hook] - repeat 2XHeat it up when this shit drop {*2X*}
Bubba Sparxxx, Collipark

[Hook]
Heat it up when this shit drop
In them big spots
Where the players let them bottles pop
See the steam on her back when her hips pop
She get it real hot, so heat it up girl
Heat it up, get it up, keep it up there {*4X*}

[Verse 1]
What it is, how are things
My phone was on silent for a minute now it rings
If you too cool, then I'm too cool
Let's not boo-who, let's just do what we do
Movin on, new song, new loan
Sometimes you can move right and still do wrong
Ain't nothin' fancy, just line up and run it
By the time you've finished talkin' bout it, I'll be done done it
Collipark, Bubba Sparxxx
Do the Ying-Yang thang or anythang, I'm just a star
Ms. New Booty, thank you ma'am
Bottom broad brought me back, dawg this money changing hands
A lot this way, a little thattaway
Earn Sunday through Friday, spend on Saturday
Yeah that's the play, get it up and keep it up there
Heat it up slow, let him quickly beat it up, Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What it is, tell me the good news
I got a tool in my draws that you should use
Give that thang a good bruise, beat it on up
Girl you've been misused, heat it on up
I'm gone show you, what it was made for
Actin' like you scared and unprepared, but you ain't though
Grab your ankles, yeah that's the angle
I'm gone make a stank ho of daddy's little angel
I'm at the condo, with General Patton
Losers make excuses, winners make it happen
We can pull the rides out, give you somethin to cry about
Give you somethin to lie about, inspiration while you pout
We can pull the broads out, in a straight line
Yours ain't fine fuck it, here, take mines
Dude you way behind, get on Bubba K. time
I'm lightyears ahead, have a light beer instead, yeah

[Hook] - 2X[Bubba Sparxxx]
Hahahahahahah! Don't be scared of me
Come on over here and let Bubba infect you
Uhh, uhh

From the slums the East of Athens to the plains in North LaGrange
Bubba K can stumble drunk up on any porch I hang
Smokin all sources dank - from Jimmy Shwagger to Cambud
And I'm chasin Jim Beam, we keep stallin until my time's up
Line up lames it's time for your vaccination
Be glad you been infected, accept it, congratulations
I got platinum asperations but fear's my motivation
I'mma wait in my time to shine but daily I grow impatient
Strictly for procreation, I need to plant my seeds
Since these bitches won't cut I'll rely on my hand to breathe
Fuckin this Cantonese, Betty named Tamberly
And her four older sisters 'til the blisters began to bleed
They probably'll banish me for spittin in how I'm live it
But I'm still with my tongue out - flickin it like a lizard
Bubba like chicken gizzards; fried in Southern pride
Man go on and drink dat beer but you know I'mma funnel mine

[Hook: Bubba Sparxxx]
Now you could shoot it in yo' veins or shoot it up straight to yo' brain
You could smoke it out a bowl or get a blunt and roll it swole
Lo and behold boy you should've done injected
Cause if you ride with me I'mma get you so infected
Now you could hit that Betty raw or bust a load off in her jaw
You could place it where she doo doo, or even lick her poo doo
See I don't care what you do, just don't leave her neglected
Cause if you fall asleep I'mma get her so infected!

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I just got off the phone with God, he said - I know this might seem odd
But Bubba I really need you, these preachers ain't doin they job
So travel to Cape Cod, buy a thousand sheets of acid
And distribute it witcho' album, no doubt that'll be a classic
Dude lockin up every fashion, whether it's dope from weed to coke
From heroin to X, so next we needin a boat
Off the coast of eastern Georgia for two hundred keys of snort
For them heavy reefer chiefers, the five was trees to blow
They count on me fo' sho', if you fronted I'm goin the low
Man I'm from who did it though, but it's funny, cause no one sold it
But now that Bubba hold it I'm certain they gon' disperse it
The rural parts the suburbs, I know that may seem absurd
But long ago when I heard they meet the urban people
They play by ears for years now my folks deserve some equal
Affection from this infection that gives our foundation
The same blood the same drugs equals a proud nation

[Hook]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Shit I probably know what you thankin when yo' legs get wobbly drankin
(Bubba K got it hard!) That's when they found yo' body stankin
And you won't be body linkin, what you thought I was from N'Sync?
I'm a country muh'fucker who ain't changed my clothes in six weeks
Runnin with a thick fleet, of hungry Caucasoids
The type when you see us in the club actin up y'all avoid
Call your boys I got boys from Westpoint to Nelly B
Yeah I run with black folks too and they do carry heat
Plus I fuck with smelly freaks and I think they pussy very sweet
The fine Betty Betty with double D's and sexy feet
On coke or ecstasy, down here we call 'em Beanie Babies
She was sensitive to the touch so when we fuck I mean it's gravy
But I ain't seen her lately - I been too busy chasin patients
We gon' shoot a movie next just so yo' ass can play the hatin
If the livest in yo' faction tellin me where the mic's at
He won't never rap again and he might not ever get his pride back

[Hook] - 2X

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Exactly like that
Now we all infected..
Now yo' life's the same as mine
And my life's the same as yours
We all standin in the same, same shit..
I thank God and Khalifani
Anybody else got infected, or willin to be infected
Nonsense.. Bubba Sparxxx[Bubba Sparxxx]
New South! LaGrange, Georgia... Athens, Georgia...
The whole state of Georgia
Daddy! The MudKats, MudKats
Bubba got another one for ya - MOMMA!
Uhh, better BELIEVE we get it done this time baby
The Mathis family, they can't hide that money from us no mo'
It's goin down, uh, yeah

[Hook: Bubba Sparxxx - repeat 2X]
Jimmy Mathis please come out here
And tell these folks who yo' son is
And momma tell Russ to load the shotgun
And get this loot cause we ain't got none (what?)

[Verse One: Bubba Sparxxx]
Ha, ha...
Any blood shed for a cause it deserves it
It's blood well worth it, we fought to preserve it
You caught him in person, you know Bubba's psyched out
You hate it when they talk, but love it when I shout
Fuck with me I doubt, that you really can
When I get to doin, my hillbilly dance
A step to the left, then two back to the right
Take a shot of Patron and then get back to the mic
Yeah I'm rappin tonight, but soon as the light hit
I'm all about the green man to hell with this white shit
Unless it's that white shit, that speed up your pulse rate
Some cardiac arrest, so sweet with a dub taste
This what they must face, I'mma be right here
Spittin these flames out, and drinkin Bud Light beer
'til the cows home and the dogs quit barkin
Daddy tell 'em who I am and don't beg no pardons

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Bubba Sparxxx]
Ahh...
They watch me in the country like the race on Sunday
And I wear the crown for 'em 'til you take it from me
I made some mo-ney, but blew most of
Bought and sold all the shit that you boast of
But I love my life and ain't much I regret
I just hope I remember, half of what I forget
Through the years and the tears, the blood and the sweat
But if you ever believe, it's time to double your bet
Cause I ain't even tapped into half my potential
But I have shown growth though, and that is essential
Grab you a pencil, and jot a few notes down
The questions they asked me, the answers I know now
Bet I ain't no clown, fuck what you thought dawg
I'm in Jimmy Mathis old truck with a sawed off
Pistol-grip pump, let some shit jump
We take it to the water and yo' ship'll get sunk

Your chest is just whatever, I found the buried treasure

Listen, first you must travel a long dusty road
This road you shall travel will seem like nowhere
But that nowhere will turn into somewhere
Keep yo' head up Bubba, don't let no body getchya down
Cuz that you travel shall turn around, begin

[Kiley Dean]
Ahhhhhh ahhhhh
Ahhhehhhhahhh
Ohhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhehhhh
Ahhhhehhhohhhh
Nowhere, nowhere

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I've accepted every challenge and risen to all occasions
The country boy done got 'em shook like Randy Moss and Jason
Perhaps all Bubba's numerals don't fit in y'alls equation
If yo' opinions coincide with that, you oughta save 'em
Cuz they groped, the greatest southern rapper fuckin period
Negative spirits, they only keep you down a myriad
Of Satan's substance is in my system, still my wisdom
Is never once compromised, that's between God and I
Never once forgotten my manners cuz my mama
Played in public housin, Opelika, Alabama
But she had a different plan for me, and Russ and Ginger
Thank the Lord for Jimmy Mathis Pops they must remember
How you held it down when them other clowns disappeared
Taught me how to seek to scope, shoot and leave with the deer
Then made me drink the blood to show me life was precious
The money rose from nowhere 'til somewhere here's my directions

[Hook 2x: Kiley Dean]
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's liiiiiike

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Can you relate to five kids, six fish sticks on the plate
Or writin Santa Claus, I guess he got the list too late
Or to catch the fish you bait the hook with little Dylan's poo poo
On Mr. Allen's property, he catch you he will shoot you
Let these cats amuse you with comical depictions
But where I'm from bein broke's no honorable affliction
Love some Jimmy Carter, but we never ever voted
But slum is still slum, so you best believe we toted
Every firearm from AKs to thirty-thirties
And from live rocks to livestock, they pays the early birdy
Thus we worked the land like you worked the block with yayo
But I chose keys over cattle cuz the profits way mo'
Might get locked away though, peddlin' them snow cones
So we keep it simplified with acres of that homegrown
Plus the finest shine that you could find this side of Memphis
From east nowhere to west somewhere still the grind is endless

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
It all comes down to this, one last chance to advance
Be honest stinkin round up to big dance all my plans
Of bein viewed is somethin special, more than just the other one
Will vanish in the papers, all the plagues the south has suffered from
The worlds weight plus a ton restin on my shoulders
But what the trackers de my curse, is blessed to them, I hold a
Cuz Eminem's incredible, but then I really have to say this
For y'all to leave my soul at rest and add me to yo' play list
But this time I may just, leap and clear that hurtle man
Cuz it's gone be a million more, who knows if they'll be worth a damn
Bubba K I surely am, with that silky kind of sound
Carson tell yo' folks that I'll be early for this time around
Cuz I've come too far for my own mistakes to dwell me
Cuz lookin' back at self inflicted wounds and achin elmy
There's nothin they can tell me, get me somewhere in a hurry
If I'm nowhere then that nowhere be nowhere near a worry
Okey dokey..

[Hook] - 4X

{*Cry Me A River beat*}

[Timbaland]
You don't have to say what you did
Come on Ki and help me sing

[Kiley Dean]
Cry me a river Oh 5x
I know what it's like to be nowhere ehh[Big Boi]
We're back
This is MC extraordinaire
Reporting to you for W-A D-F, generation one television
We here in a remote area
Somewhere way back up in the woods
With members of the elite Dungeon Family
Them boys in there workin' on some shit so fire
I bullshit you not

[Killer Mike]
Ey, welcome to Purple Ribbon, prime-time official
Killer Mike, y'all
Killer kill from the ville, go hard on the rhyme
Like a junkie on powder I go hard every line
I'm a ex-Dope Boi but I still rap low
And I sold more horse than a polo sto'
I'm destined to become a millionaire
Similar to Phil Collins I can feel it in the air
My car change colors like a million airs
Necklace, get reckless and touch my chain
I put it in the air and bust your brain
Any sucker out there tryna' take my cash
Better pray God with him when I catch his ass
Or he gon' lay there dyin' wit' a bullet in his ass

We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Pardon my French but if you give me an inch
I'm a take five kilometres and give it to the commoners
Some dirty white boys and some hoochie black girls
Nearly one million sold but I'm still in that world
That's why you won't see Bubba, buck head bouncin'
Unless it's the cream and I'm upstairs countin'
You know the type of bread that don't involve accountants
Continuin' the legacy my four fathers founded
We won a lot of battles but the war is still ragin'
She's turned a lot of tricks but the whore is still agein'
What is ? what God gave me for my birthday
You ain't D-F dawg, fuck what your shirt say
Talkin' bout he's undeserving of the blessin's
When truthfully the tat was roomin' them suggestions
New ? clean in the game they ?
We ain't them boys that you can't say earned it

We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders

[Big Boi]
Every now and then, me and my kin, we get to bussin'
Not in the high school football game, I'm talkin' bout rhyme thrustin'
I'm talkin' bout line crushin', somethin's empty bumpin'
On the low straight out the oven like some blueberry muffins
We got the stuffing like some ? or somethin', macaroni, mackalicious
Mack a bitch or a woman, there is a difference
Not if the woman start bitchin', won't get in the kitchen
Male, chauvinistic, nah, ho, you missed it
I'm just kiddin', just playin', I'm just sayin' we humpin' around
Like the ghost of Bobby Brown and Stankonia lingerin' round
We have found proof of sound of our ground
When we've split in two parts, no one can block us now
Maybe top lock but we can't stop, let the great white head be severed
We weathered the storm, with feathers, something we treasure
(Well I never) and you never will, suckered up
The Dungeon Family is here to stay and we don't give a flying fuck

We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bitch riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all

Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized, in a trance
From this body so buttery brown and tantalizing
You would have thought I needed help
From this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

[Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head, oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin at my feet, oh my
Ooh, some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red, who could this be

[Tweet]
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride, let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mine's, I got worried
I looked over to the left, a reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

[Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head, oh my, oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin at my feet, oh my, oh my
Ooh, some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my, oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red, who could this be

[Bubba Sparxxx]
So we've been tussling for a year and a half and the flame is burnin out
I'm ? you fussin, these discussions I ain't concerned about
For me being the man that I am a practice intolerance
I know the way you touch me would be a hard act to follow
It's in the best interests of you and I to just take a night off
You left by yourself, I called up Timmy, he set it right off
We started out in Logan's ended up in the Monkey drunk
Stopped by the ATM, bought the bar out and drunk it up
But in the mean time I wonder why I ain't heard of Betty
I'm tired of these steak eaters plus my new shirt is sweaty
Home around three for what I saw I was unprepared
Don't stop on my behalf, mmhmm go right ahead

[Tweet] (Missy)
I looked over to the left (mm, I was lookin so good I couldn't reject myself), oh
I looked over to the left (mm, I was feelin so good I had to touch myself), oh
I looked over to the left (mm, I was eyein my thighs butter pecan brown), oh
I looked over to the left (mm, comin out of my shirt and then my skirt came down)

[Tweet] (Missy)
Oops, there goes my shirt (mm) up over my head (mm), oh my (mm), oh my
Oops, (mm) there goes my skirt (mm) droppin at my feet (mm), oh my (mm), oh my
Ooh, (mm) some kind of touch (mm) caressing my legs (mm), oh my (mm), oh my
Ooh, (mm) I'm turning red (mm), who could this be (mm, mm)

Mm, mm, mm, ooh

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oops, oops, oh my, oh my[Bubba Sparxxx]
Yes sirree (uhh uhh uhh) no he didn't (uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh)
Yeah they did (uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh)
(Uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh) yeah they did..
(Uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh) ..
(Uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh, freaky freaky)

Who just stepped off in this game and emphasizin' them WHITE THANGS
And invited y'all to test me wherever they MIC HANG?
Didn't need no Hannibal to see Betty got NICE BRAIN
Now they thankin I'm disturbed, believe me I'm QUITE SANE
See we managed to find them flows somehow it's EASY Y'ALL
Take the hardest Timmy beat massage it and MAKE IT SOFT
Go 'head take it off, I won't tell yo' daddy baby
I always had game but I've been extra savvy lately
You probably saw me at the corners in that candy Dodge Ram
Folks who ain't heard the news say, "Look at Andy, God damn"
That must be renowned fam cause I ain't even got a Dodge
But still that same raggy, quite import in my garage
I swear on every ounce of blood in my mama's veins
That I walk these dogs across this country twice to stop the pain
So I'm handin Tim the leash and when I do I hope you cry
Now tell these sons of bitches get this gate, OPEN WIDE

[Hook 2X: Bubba Sparxxx]
Here we come so please somebody tell them to get, OPEN WIDE
Got three Bettys and I might go tell them that they OPEN WIDE
Got this thang out on the back country rollin is OPEN WIDE
It's what? OPEN WIDE! It's what? OPEN WIDE, whoa!

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Now shit's, sorta changed, since I strolled, in this thang
Cause I froze, on your brain, like a nose, full of 'caine
Now I, try me a few drugs just to, find me a new buzz
But that, time gave me too much, thank God, I finally grew up
How could, I bring this so raw? Pack up, sing your shit on law
You mad? Well then that's yo' loss; that's why, yo' bitch is on toss
Drink up, if you really wanna run, y'all wild like Timmy on the drums
They know, not to get me on the rum
Four-fifth, that is heavy when I'm done
Y'all want me to bust? Y'all sure y'all want me to bust?
I'm in the zone to bust - goin adjust to the home of the fuss
Am I versatile? Probably the best y'all heard in a while
Have mercy child - don't just shake it twerk it with style
Don't y'all love when I talk? How I sell it the way it was bought
The way I was taught - really I fought this battle for naught
And in conclusion - let me say that I'm on yo' side
To hell with Bubba - now show your pride and OPEN WIDE

[Hook]

[Sebastian]
I was sippin pro, Remi slow, did enough to breakin the law
Flavors froze, songs I chose 'til I get the crowd involved
So I do shows and I lift clothes and point the mic to y'all
Which pistol, could get yo', eyes away from the bar?
Problem solved, stir and call the food court in the mall
And any chick, that I saw, I got her number and all
Help me y'all, if her closet is too small
For some domino drawers or a piece of her, bra
I would reckon that one of her damn digits is off
I legitamately call and end up with a pizza that's large
So I'm, sick of you broads and you, neighborhood stars
Don't care about your cars like Bubba get out the yard
Listen, damnit Bubba pay attention to my hoes with extension
Got my vogues on suspension, got my pushes in the kitchen
Got my streets, on a mission; got my corners with they trickin
There's no fam in this business - came in too fast (sorry)

[Hook][Fred Durst]
Just think about it
Just think about it

[Fred Durst]
Lately I've been skeptical
Silent when I would used to speak
Distant from all around me
Who witness me fail and become weak
Life is overwhelming
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

[Fred Durst]
But you don't understand when, I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go
You and me we're through and rearranged

[Fred Durst]
It seems that you're not satisfied
There's too much on your mind
So you leave and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find
Life is overwhelming
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

[Fred Durst]
But you don't understand when, I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go
You and me we're through and rearranged
You and me we're through and rearranged

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I used to couldn't catch a ride, now they eager to catch the vibe
And this ain't a teen rebellion, this shit is an act of pride
Used to come out to play, they'd tell me get back inside
Now I'm at full strength, and your reduce is magnified
I recall so clearly, Betty's I sit beside
Saying, "Andy please stop throwing others a pack of lies"
But now I'm back home she say I ain't actin' right
But after TRL I'm too stubborn to rationalize
Not like it really matters, but in a sense it does
Wasn't with me in the struggle, yet you pretend you was
And in my absence found another friend you love
Hope he place a little Bubba everytime he sends you love
And again who is he, just the newest friend you love
There's been plenty inbetween us loosie goosie in the club
But you should know me no choochie boochie in my blood
I'm with Hew Heff and Freddie groupie-groupie'ing it up

[Fred Durst]
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin
Cryin on me
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin
Dyin on me

[Fred Durst]
You think that everybody's the same
I don't think that anybody's like you
You think that everybody's the same
I don't think that anybody's like you

[Fred Durst]
Just think about it
You'll get it[Verse 1]
I don't need this, all I need is us - come on girl let's put it in the wind
I don't care none about no one, if they loved us they should it did it when
They had a chance but now the dance is over and fa sho its our way time
Let the top down, we can't stop now, explain the past - baby I ain't tryin
I ain't lyin, when I say we done came of age and when thangs done changed
Time to spread our wings, fly to better things, pack ya suitcase todays the day
Don't tell ya momma don't tell ya sister it'll only complicate the issue
We'll mail 'em a box of tissues, the only one that loves you is right here with you
Girl don't ever look back, our destiny awaits us
And whatever place we pump the brakes I'll work my hands to the bone n just what it takes to
Give us everything our folks never had, I'm prepared for that
It may take a while but Ima make ya smile forever I said a prayer for that and
I know he's listenin atleast to this one, if you never heard none of the others
This is me and you and Im'a see it through from this highway to under the covers, baby!

[Hook]
Oohhhhh Hoooooo!
I wanna run away with you (I wanna run away, I wanna run away)
I wanna run away with you (cuz baby your my everything)
I wanna run away with you (I wanna run away, I wanna run away)
I wanna run away with you (cuz baby your my everything)

[Verse 2]
We got off the exit in Waco, Frankie J was on the radio
I asked her was she afraid to go all the way with this, she delayed to know
I said baby I just need to know, if you ain't down we can turn around
Your happiness is my happiness and thats the only thing thats concernin me now
Just hurt me now, she said "would you please just let me talk for once?"
Then all at once she went in to how she been tryin to prevent this all for months
Not at all because she didn't love me and only me, it's just that she
Had withheld one vital piece of info, she looked up at me
With both eyes full of tears, she said "you remember that day at the clinic?
I went in with the doctor and told you I did it? I wasn't able to go through with it"
No you didn't, how could you? Wait a minute, that makes you what?
3 months and some change, well baby doll that just ain't enough
To derail us cuz see, that just means there's three of us
But answer this, at what point did you think this topic should be discussed?
I don't know whether to cry or smile, but somehow I'm doin both
But this changes nothin, I got 2 babies and I solemnly swear to be true to both, baby!

[Hook]

[Bridge - Frankie J]
I wanna run, wanna run away
There's nothin they can do or say to make us stay
I wanna run, wanna run away
There's nothin they can't do, there's nothin they can't say
I wanna run, wanna run away
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wanna run, wanna run away
I wanna run away, baby

[Hook]Hmmmmm (OW) (OH)
Hmmmmm (OW) (OH)
Hmmmmm (OW) (OH)
Hmmmmm, c'mon (OW)

Make them beats like you used to make (oh)
Now keep movin (oh) now keep movin (oh)
Make them beats like you used to make (woo)
(OOHHH), (c'mon)

[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
Timbaland done lost his mind (mind)
I think I'm about to cross the line (line)
And find me somethin that soft to find (find)
And hit it cause she swing right off the vine (oh)
You better hold me back, I told you that
I got enough heat to take your corners back
And I done took your freak, you want her back
(Well you can have that hooker, hooker, hooker) (c'mon)
I'm a dirty south nigga from the VA streets (oh)
And this is how I represent over this here beat (uh huh)
And y'all don't really wanna fuck with me
I don't care what y'all say, y'all stuck with me (alright now)
Now I got the place panicin (oh)
Timbaland and my dirty shenanigan (oh)
And I might put two in the sky (uh huh)
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (woo)

[Hook]
You better hold me back (oh)
You better hold me back (oh)
You better hold me back
Cause I'm full of shenanigans

(Oh) You better hold me back (oh)
You better hold me back (oh)
You better hold me back
Cause I'm full of shenanigans

[Verse 2 - Magoo]
Hold me back, cause rap sell more than crack
Stack my funds, my guns, take my quarters back
Don't resist I will put heat on the track
Matter of fact, we can take it off of wax
You and your team was livin the dream, somebody shake 'em
I can't hold on these dreams they won't wake 'em
Fuck face, the street is a car chase
Ew dead set, do what it take, to win the race
I erase my fear and don't reappear
I'mma go to the bar and take your beer, bitch
Nigga, I must make shit clear
Fuck around with Oo, I'll bite off your ear
You better do the same, I fight 'til your slain
On right just to bite, I'm tryna sever a vein
And I might put two in the sky
Like (da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Sucker live in fear of the day that I'm focused
Slow as he appear, it's clear I own this
Realm of Southern rap that despise to be competitive
North or northfolk, they jokes is our negligence
Sure they bounce to 112, I make a note of what sells
Down here the sign men don't promote it, look at us fail
Fuck it, I'mma just tell the truth as I perceive it
Most of them think our shit is useless, believe it
But me I got a love affair with all things Southern
The dirty is a territory y'all can't govern
We all ain't brothers, but this ain't the bitches neither
And all our rap songs ain't for bouncers drinkin either
Let me hit the reefer, 'fore I forgot to be the
Little old country white boy, get to spittin ether
Don't let this shit deceive ya, that cracker there crafty
I know you only heard me cause you have to stare at me (BITCH)

[Hook]

(*humming continues*)

... full of shenanigansThe world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I got a whole lot of issues that are unresolved
I went 2 weeks without seeing nobody, just my dog
His name is Blao, he's the closest thing to a child
I may ever have, I’m selfish as hell, why lie
Too self absorbed of relationships, still I try
From time to time to find me one for my life
And my patterns are hard for a decent woman to
Respect or accept, so whores I keep em' comin through
In the bed with a babbling bitch that loves me
And she bad it’s just some about it’s ugly
After we finish, I hate when she try to touch me
It ain’t her fault, that’s just me
I slowly weigh down, but I ain’t perfect though
Relapse is a record that I done heard before
And I’m no Marshall Mathers, I’m talking Andy Mathis
I’m talking deadly habits, it’s so sad and tragic

[Hook]
The world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter
I know I’m a sinner
But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away
Cause I’m cold as the winter
And life done got up under my skin like a splinter
I know I’m a winner
But all I can do is pray, don't let me lose my faith today

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
I tried my best to be so good to some folks
The same people showed me betrayal up close
The flip side of that coin is I’ve been negligent
With a lot of my real friends I never meant
To let a day turn into a month and then a year
Without speaking to you, I know that it appears
I just forgot about y’all but really in truth
I forgot about me too, this igloo
I built around myself it’s so frigid
And it ain’t melting away, I don’t dig it
I know life is gone, I’m gon' miss it
It’s like it never was here, if you don’t live it
I think about the past and get so livid
What the fuck was you thinking, I don’t get it
You so capable, personality magnetic
Life could have been so good if you had let it

[Hook]
The world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter
I know I’m a sinner
But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away
Cause I’m cold as the winter
And life done got up under my skin like a splinter
I know I’m a winner
But all I can do is pray, don't let me lose my faith today

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
I may not be the shit to you but where I come from
Them people love Bub, therefor I must just
Stay faithful, the lord got his hands on me
And you don’t hate me, you just don’t understand, homie
There from humble beginnings I saw limitless
Possibility, fear was my only nemesis
Along the way I forfeited my innocence
But that is ok, thank you lord

For all the pain, the affliction
It’s like a mirror in my face that I need to see
All my loss, my addiction
Showed me something that I really needed to know about me
It’s like a shape to me, you’re more than me
Killing this heart is controlling me
Though I’m out of control, you still order me
Folding me up inside your hands and the words don’t come

[Hook]
The world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter
I know I’m a sinner
But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away
Cause I’m cold as the winter
And life done got up under my skin like a splinter
I know I’m a winner
But all I can do is pray, let me make it through the day
Let me make it through the day
