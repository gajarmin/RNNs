[ Daddy-O ]
Ah yeah
Smooth dedications goin out to
My man the E Double and the PMD
Special dedications to DJ Scratch
And the Albany Projects in Brooklyn, you know what I'm sayin?

We gonna break it down a little somethin like this here

1, 2, and don't forget the Daddy
O is for the only, chief is for relief
People like to talk about the Hip-Hop Band
Not that they get away with it, but they think they can
Cuttin their eyes, and frownin at Wise
And sayin Paul can't cut - kiss my butt
Don't know Bobby, smirkin at D.B
Boy, stop jockin S-t-e-t
Do what you feel, and if you feel real froggish
Leap on this, so I can bust your lip
Because Allah made man, but man made speech
And speech is only talk, and talk is cheap

[ Delite ]
Well, like a boxer, we got the groove that sticks and moves
Boom! another k.o., and now a major news
No short cuts when it came down to this
Some have wrote us off cause we continued to persist
Without fail, our actions prevail
Success breeds, and the legend unveils
While many pop duty, the Band stood cooly
Till our chance came, and we smashed them rudely
Proved that the soft talk was all pink water
Baked and fried em and threw em all a quarter
Cause when you talk that talk, and your talk is kinda cheap
You reap what you sow, and you sow what you reap

(Action speaks louder than words) (2x)

[ Daddy-O ]
Aiyo, the situation seems very peculiar
Like the Jungle Brothers said: I'm gonna do ya
But I'm not gonna do ya like a guy does a girl
When I do you, I'm gonna crash your world
Lights out, with the click of a switch you're cut off
You can't handle, so you break north
Then I said it before, and I'mma say it again
I'm the Daddy, O is for the wars I win, friend

[ Delite ]
Speaking of a war, yo, I get excited
The taste of victory, man, keeps me ignited
And like a bolt of light that shoots across the darkness
I'm flippin MC's out by my pin-point sharpness
Punishment is due them, I whip em very thorough
I'm servin up the hype like there ain't no tomorrow
The a-c-t-i-o-n means get the job done
MC Delite, now grab hold to my wisdom

(Action speaks louder than words) (4x)

[ Daddy-O ]
Sittin in the park out in East New York
Soak in the sun, watchin the girlies walk
By, some say "Hi", and some say "Hello"
And some say, "How you're doin, Daddy-O?"
I say, "Alright, but the beef I got
Is how the faggot MC's try to cop my spot"
Cause it's cool to occupy your own
But if you come for mine, I'm gonna crash your dome
See, I don't really always wanna be the aggressor
But my respect for MC's continues gettin lesser
And just like my mother used to say in the past
Don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash

[ Delite ]
So just imagine all the flack that you'll be catchin
When you're pop that weak, boy, yo, I be bashin
Rip all your bull, to show that we're winnin
By blood, sweat, no tears, we're provin, not pretendin
We daze and amaze till foes are left confused
Like some men treat their women, they get whipped and abused
Cause Stet is rolling strong, so what the hell goes on
Try to gank this, your ass is gettin bombed
Cause action overspeaks above any plight
Peace, sincerely yours from MC Delite

(Action speaks louder than words) (4x)[Produced by MC Delite and Prince Paul]

[Verse 1]
Well here's how it started, heard you on the radio
Talking 'bout rap, saying all that crap
About how we sample, giving examples
Think we'll let you get away with that?
You criticize our method of how we make records
You said it wasn't art, so now we're gonna rip you apart
Stop, check it out my man
This is the music of a hip-hop band
Jazz, well you can call it that
But this jazz retains a new format
Point, where you misjudged us
Speculated, created a fuss
You've made the same mistake politicians have
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 2]
Talk, well I heard talk is cheap
But like beauty, talk is just skin deep
And when you lie and you talk a lot
People tell you to step off a lot
You see, you misunderstood, a sample's just a tactic
A portion of my method, a tool, in fact it's
Only of importance when I make it a priority
And what we sample's loved by the majority
But you a minority in terms of thought
Narrow minded and poorly taught
About hip-hop, playing all the silly games
To erase my music so no one can use it
You step on us and we'll step on you
Can't have your cake and eat it too
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 3]
Lies, that's when you hide the truth
It's when you talk more jazz than proof
And when you lie and address something you don't know
It's so wack that it's bound to show
When you lie about me or the band we get angry
Whip out our pen, start writing again
And the things we write are always true
Sucker, get a grip, now we talking 'bout you
Seems to me that you have a problem
So we can see what we can do to solve them
Think rap is a fad? You must be mad
Cause we're so bad we get respect you never had
Tell the truth, James Brown was old
'Til Eric and Ra came out with "I Got Soul"
Rap brings back old R&B
And if we would not, people could've forgot
We wanna make this perfectly clear
We're talented and strong and have no fear
Of those who choose to judge but lack pizazz
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 4]
Now we're not trying to be a boss to you
We just wanna get across to you
That if you're talking jazz, the situation is a no-win
You might even get hurt, my friend
Stetsasonic, the hip-hop band
And like Sly and the Family Stone, we will stand
Up for the music we live and play
And for the song we sing today
For now, let us set the record straight
And later on we'll have a forum and a formal debate
But it's important you remember though
What you reap is what you sow
Talkin' all that jazz[Daddy-O] I got a (girl named Sally)
[Delite] And she don't squawk
[Daddy-O] Or eat pork
[Both] With a spoon or fork
[Daddy-O] But I heard that

The way Sally walk)
(Ahem)
(Some people don't like the way
They way Sally walk)
(Ahem)
(1-2-3-4 Hit it!)

[Daddy-O]
This story's funny
I met this girl, and she had money
In vast abundance
Goo-goo gobs, I mean redundance
Her eyes were hazel
Her dress was suede, her voice was nasal
I found her so fly
But for the life of me, I didn't know why

[Hook]

[Delite]
Now here's what took place
We threw this jam, she rented the space
Nice place to party
But wouldn't you know, it turned out sorry
It's so confusin'
And sometimes I say it's amusin'
The jam was okay
'Til Sally walked in, cause just like I say

You know what? She don't live in Manhatten
Bronx, Queens, or the island of Staten
She's a Brooklyn swinga
So fly, every Friday night I might ring her
Telephone, yo D guess what (What?)
She's all alone (So?)
Stoned to the bone
Her shape's full grown
The kind of girl I'd love to own, ya see cause

[Hook]

[Daddy-O]
I'm still with Sally
Paid and now we both chill in Cali

[Frukwan]
I think I love her
I know that I think highly of her

Of tying the knot

She's opened my nose

[ Daddy-O ]
My first taste of Miami Bass
Came on my first tour, this I gotta relate
I was at the hotel, had nothin to do
Flipped on the radio, heard the 2 Live Crew
Started dancin around, left and went downtown
Bought up some mo' shit, cause the shit was down
Then I said to myself: New York ignited the Bass
But in Miami is where they got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Fruitkwan ]
This may be hard to believe
But in Miami I ain't even wanted to leave
I seen a girl so fly, she caught my eye
With her Benzi box kickin a song, give it a try
So she rolled down her tint with a look that said 'come'
I got real close, and then the telephone rung
You couldn't say I wasn't in a serious place
Cause in Miami the girls got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Delite ]
While cooling in Miami in my fresh limo
I seen a fly girl, so I said hello
She was quite polite, so real and so nice
She asked for my name, I said my name is Delite
I said, "Now where do you go on a Saturday night?"
She said, "Downtown, I know the place that's right"
An ace for your taste, a smile for your face
Cause Miami is known for the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Fruitkwan ]
Going for swim when the ocean is rugged
A six plus on my kick is how I love it
Heavy rotated, bass is waded
Radio jocks don't understand how it's rated
Want my opinion? It's all about winning
Cause I think big, and in Miami I'mma dig in
Grab me a piece of what I'll never replace
Cause I still say the girls got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Daddy-O ]
Now know that it's true, from Stetsasonic to you
That we're from New York, our allegiance is true
We're not makin a fuss, but my man, you can trust
That the bass from Miami is a serious must
So loosen up your body, let your mind be free
Forget all your worries, the drink's on me
And after a while we're gonna wiggle our waist
Cause in Miami is where they got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

Scorpio, and my name is Delite
And the lady that I like
Is one with a classy feel of warmth and sensitivity
Who will be my everyday sunshine
Even on a cloudy day
So if you fit this plan
Grab my hand
And try to understand

From the instant moment I saw your face
You can best do believe my heart began to race
The playboy died and soon I realized
I was stunned by love when I looked into your eyes
Wishful thinkin, wishin you was right here
I'm on fire, I want to hold you near
Your lips are wet and your skin is soft
So let's allow this love to take its course
Float on, girl

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Fruitkwan]
Peace
My name is Fruitkwan
And my sign is Virgo
Now what I love in a woman
Is treatin you in a royal manner
For you are queen of royal beauty
That deserves words of treasure
As soon as you come home
I greet you by sayin

Peace queen, your glow is so sweet
You feel so good, you look so unique
And girl, if there's a problem that's too difficult
Fruitkwan, I got the final result
For livin, see
By fulfillin each other's need
My love for you grows, queen, hear my plea
Cause you're my first-place prize
It's all about me and you, don't cry
Float on

[Verse 3: Wise]
Now my name is Wise
And I'm a Leo
And I like a woman
With a realistic imagination
A woman that thinks for herself
Whose thoughts are bold and free
And girl
In your deepest thoughts
This is the key

So just close your eyes, picture the love of your dreams
So listen up, young ladies, this is what I mean
If it's lovin you need to fulfill your blues
Wise Supreme Love is my name to you
The quality you'd expect, it couldn't be beat
Cuddliness you'll always have from me to you, my sweet
With the best of respect, hugs, kisses and charm
Girl, you'll have so much love, you'll float on

And my name is Daddy-O
And I like the kind of girl
That loves to get away
You know
Like long trips, weekend cruises in far away places
And if I had my choice
Girl, we'd be in a land of our own

Just think of a land, a lovely land
And in that land I'd take your hand
And walk the shores of love evermore
And ride the waves of life's better days
We'll make a stop every now and then
To enjoy the breeze of the blowing wind
We'll expore what's deep within
And I won't stop till you say when
So float on, girl

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Daddy-O]
A romantic cruise, our hearts we gave
You were the ship, girl, and I was the wave
Passion intense and love undefined
I give you the world just for you to be mine
Pleasure and pain, like a hand in glove
I'm Daddy-O, girl, I'm no stranger to love
But this I confess, in others words I'll imply
That a man can be strong but best believe he can cry
I can't help but think about it, it's the way I feel
A tear may roll down my face because my love is for real
And the love that we share, the moment we embrace
And yes, I knew it was true by the look on my face
Cause the harder the stroke, the higher the love floats
Passion so strong that, girl, it ain't no joke
Some people may say I sing the same old song
But like a ship in the night, you float on

But when that tape is (Stetsa-Stet!)
You tally a time, you won't forget
You listen to a band, the sound is hoopin'
It ain't no time for party poopin'
You could get down to the real McCoy
And enjoy, the music we employ
How that sound? The Stet's a-bound
The Hip-Hop band, the six renowned
A musical flow with an added twist
And for you girlies, Wise is gonna throw you a kiss

And they get mopped ???

We're like scotch tape
Stickin' as if on the court

Everybody gets pumped that we showed you
So listen to the band with the musical sway

Now all you ladies start the clappin'
Cause the mix machine is rappin'
Fellas, start your fingers snappin'
Cause I just came to say what's happenin'
Your boy Prince Paul is doin' the jammin'
While the MC's take care of the rammin'
And DBC, his beats are slammin'
The human percussion, everybody examine
So check out the bass line with the beat
Playin' along, right by I mean
Keys and beats while I'm bustin' the rhyme
Right about this time I know it's blowin your mind
Showin' the group that he's a step above
Up on the microphone is Wise's supreme love
So before I go, and get on my way
DB' let the music play

And you can taste and feel our ingredient
With speed, we give you what you need
And any barracade we will truly stampede
Cause we're the bow, the arrow plus the archer
And on the strength, kings of the rapture
Plain and simple, we're out to win
Grease bumpy slip, but we're smilin'
Right out the box we got a rough, hard core
The Stet's mystique is like a lion's roar
Your rhythm slam, I'll slam it like a hammer

Ch-ch-ch-champ wit the punch of a verbal grenade
And a rhyme that's equipped as a barricade
Cool and clever, crack I never
Wit my crew I will never sever
Brooklyn, New York is our home town
That is the place we always go down
And every night a party goes down
And when it starts, it never slows down
We boogie to the DJ's non-stop
To the sound of the Brooklyn hip-hop
And if you've ever seen Brooklyn rock
(*scratchin of 'Brooklyn'*) rocks it non-stop, BREAK........

Break:

Go Brooklyn (x15)

Point blank, our deliverance is me but smooth
Stands out like a winner at'cha favorite tune
All tension is released upon the call of the beat
As you rock along to a funky treat
Like a torch, we're keepin you active
Our rhythm will hold you captive
We're perfecters of the poem we sing
Mobbin in to the top with the style's that's addicting
No doubt, about what we capture
A-nother classical treasure
So productive and effective
Chuck it out as a jam that's spreading

It-it ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it cos you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lotta sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Stet can lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This song is complete and captured, BREAK.....[ INTRO: Daddy-O ]
And yes y'all
You're about to bear witness
To microphone fitness
A true and livin feat
To get you out your seat
A poetical fare
A glow with the glare
A kick and a snare
Built for your desire
And now...
The Stet is on fire

[ Delite (REPEATED) ]
ON FIRE!

[ *Prince Paul scratching* ]

[ VERSE 1: Fruitkwan ]
We're on fire, our style is the gangster rock
That burns, and add a snap to the crews per rock
Like starch gets hard, not firm as an arch
A diagram that's designed for biters to march
We're athletically inclined like a gymnast flip
And rock 'n roll could never ever hip-hop like this
It's to the beat y'all, as I go on and on
Don't stop the wop until you (BREAK YOUR ARM!)
We're on fire, raw, and we're God-conceived
The electrifyin act of intensity
Is mandatorily right the ??? coacts
Better gather up your force or you might get waxed
The trend is up to date, very sharp and chic
Hah, suave and well breeded to reach its peak
Beware of the Stet as the flame burns higher
Long live forever the Stet, hah, cause we're on fire

[ Delite (REPEATED) ]
ON FIRE!

[ *Prince Paul scratching* ]

[ VERSE 2: Delite ]
Prepare for the heat for the Stet is on fire
Born to be on as the fuel of your desire
Thirsty like a blaze up the road to fame
We're blessed with the gift to entertain
So roll out respect as we walk in
The Stet legacy is about to begin
Young ladies, let me know am I doin okay?
Am I sharp and on point to rock ya this way?
MC Delite and I'm a mean rappin bomber
A sentimental poetical charmer
Way above par, earning high regards
For the style I produced is (SUPER-CHARGED!)
So let's go, come on and raise your hands high
Grab yourself a partner, our time has arrived
Defense layin firm for this empire
Strong is the role of the Stet, and we're on fire

[ Delite (REPEATED) ]
ON FIRE!

[ VERSE 3: Daddy-O ]
We were born to be on
Got strong and life-long
Our element of song
Could never steer you wrong
We attack like a fleet
And burn like the heat
We win like a champ and the victory is sweet
We drive like a drill
We soothe like a pill
We consume till we're filled
Opposition is nill
We speak to attain unattainable feats
...and I'm rockin to the beat
Y'all and you don't quit
As I rely solely upon my wit
To help me say this rhyme 'fore I forget
And rock much parties till skies are lit
Cause it's a sure hit from my rhymin kit
While other MC's takin a stand I sit
And if a jam gets ill I'll deal with it
Cause I'm as hot (HOT!) as hot (HOT!) could ever get
And I'm not a nitwit when I throw a Stet fit (fit)
I hear em yellin and yellin (DADDY-O IS LEGIT!)
And I don't smoke crack cause I'm not with it (with it)
The crew is crack-free and we'll admit it ('mit it)
Stet's been stickin out a stake for style
And on the mic we a-fi wicked and sometimes wild
We are the ones that'll take you higher
We're the band called Stet (my man) and we're on fire

[ Delite (REPEATED) ]
ON FIRE!

[ *Prince Paul scratching* ]

[ VERSE 4: all ]
We-we-we took a little time
Wrote a little rhyme
Spent a little money on some studio time
Came up with a fresh little funky beat
Added a scratch to make it all complete
And now it's on wax, so we can relax
And work a little harder on a little more tracks
It might add up to a little more tax
At the end of the year we claim it all back
When we're coolin on the block we carry our big box
Playin L.L.'s 'Rock the Bells' or Run's 'Rock Box'
Wearin some high-top Cons or some Fila socks
And the newest Benetton sweatshirt in stock
We rent a Cadillac stretch and explore the town
And if some fly girls pass we roll our windows down
And say, "Hey fly girl, can we take you to the wire?
We're the band called Stet - and we're on fire"
We're ?flyer than chicks? and rollin our punches
And when it comes to rhymes, we write em in bunches
Put us at back, we went triple headers
Try to get Stet, we'll just get Stetter
And if you call us a crew we'll call you a liar
We're the band called Stet (my man) and we're on fire

[ Delite (REPEATED) ]
ON FIRE![Daddy-O] I got a (girl named Sally)
[Delite] And she don't squawk
[Daddy-O] Or eat pork
[Both] With a spoon or fork
[Daddy-O] But I heard that

[Hook]
(Some people don't like the way
The way Sally walk)
(Ahem)
(Some people don't like the way
They way Sally walk)
(Ahem)
(1-2-3-4 Hit it!)

[Daddy-O]
This story's funny
I met this girl, and she had money
In vast abundance
Goo-goo gobs, I mean redundance
Her eyes were hazel
Her dress was suede, her voice was nasal
I found her so fly
But for the life of me, I didn't know why

[Hook]

[Delite]
Now here's what took place
We threw this jam, she rented the space
Nice place to party
But wouldn't you know, it turned out sorry
It's so confusin'
And sometimes I say it's amusin'
The jam was okay
'Til Sally walked in, cause just like I say

[Hook]

Bridge:
(girl named Sally)
(girl named Sally hit it)
(girl named Sally)
(girl named Sally)
(1-2-3-4 Hit it!)
(girl named Sally)
(girl named Sally hit it)
(girl named Sally)
(girl named Sally)
(1-2-3-4 Hit it!)

[Daddy-O]
You know what? She don't live in Manhatten
Bronx, Queens, or the island of Staten
She's a Brooklyn swinga
So fly, every Friday night I might ring her
Telephone, yo D guess what (What?)
She's all alone (So?)
Stoned to the bone
Her shape's full grown
The kind of girl I'd love to own, ya see cause

[Hook]

[Daddy-O]
I'm still with Sally
Paid and now we both chill in Cali

[Frukwan]
I think I love her
I know that I think highly of her

[Delite]
Believe it or not
I even thought
Of tying the knot

[All Three]
She's opened my nose
And I ignore the story that goes:

[Hook]

Bridge (x2)[Produced by MC Delite and Prince Paul]

[Verse 1]
Well here's how it started, heard you on the radio
Talking 'bout rap, saying all that crap
About how we sample, giving examples
Think we'll let you get away with that?
You criticize our method of how we make records
You said it wasn't art, so now we're gonna rip you apart
Stop, check it out my man
This is the music of a hip-hop band
Jazz, well you can call it that
But this jazz retains a new format
Point, where you misjudged us
Speculated, created a fuss
You've made the same mistake politicians have
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 2]
Talk, well I heard talk is cheap
But like beauty, talk is just skin deep
And when you lie and you talk a lot
People tell you to step off a lot
You see, you misunderstood, a sample's just a tactic
A portion of my method, a tool, in fact it's
Only of importance when I make it a priority
And what we sample's loved by the majority
But you a minority in terms of thought
Narrow minded and poorly taught
About hip-hop, playing all the silly games
To erase my music so no one can use it
You step on us and we'll step on you
Can't have your cake and eat it too
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 3]
Lies, that's when you hide the truth
It's when you talk more jazz than proof
And when you lie and address something you don't know
It's so wack that it's bound to show
When you lie about me or the band we get angry
Whip out our pen, start writing again
And the things we write are always true
Sucker, get a grip, now we talking 'bout you
Seems to me that you have a problem
So we can see what we can do to solve them
Think rap is a fad? You must be mad
Cause we're so bad we get respect you never had
Tell the truth, James Brown was old
'Til Eric and Ra came out with "I Got Soul"
Rap brings back old R&B
And if we would not, people could've forgot
We wanna make this perfectly clear
We're talented and strong and have no fear
Of those who choose to judge but lack pizazz
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 4]
Now we're not trying to be a boss to you
We just wanna get across to you
That if you're talking jazz, the situation is a no-win
You might even get hurt, my friend
Stetsasonic, the hip-hop band
And like Sly and the Family Stone, we will stand
Up for the music we live and play
And for the song we sing today
For now, let us set the record straight
And later on we'll have a forum and a formal debate
But it's important you remember though
What you reap is what you sow
Talkin' all that jazz[Intro]
My beat forever
4 Ever My Beat, 4 Ever My Beat (echoes)
4-4-4-4-4 Ever My...

[Daddy-O]
4 Ever My Beat, this beat is mine forever
The tembo is slow and the rhymes are clever
Me trade this beat? No, I will never, huh
It gets funky at switch of a lever
Some beats are great, this beat is greater
And some are straight, this one is straighter
So get on the floor and forget ya stance
And cruise to the beat that makes you dance

[Delite]
4 Ever My Beat, orchestrated as a treble I rate
Havin' all that it takes, make no mistake
Now we're the band wit the clan that rock every fan
Hit the hoop, after school, fuck, hide the mail
So get down, come on and bust a move
Delite, Daddy-o and Fru' are out to rule
As you some the fun, who are second to none
So let's meet you, the beat of the drum
4 Ever My Beat-a

[Chorus]
4 Ever My
My-My-My-My-My-My beat forever
4-4-4-4 Ever My ("beat" scratched up)
My-My-My-My-My-My beat forever
4-4-4-4 Ever My
My-My-My-My-My-My beat forever

[Frukwan]
4 Ever My Beat, kinda fittin' this beat won't happen
Not even overnight cuz we be slappin' the beat
Like a freak, for the rest of the week
And if you front on stage, baby doll, we make sure it cease
That you boogie to the sounds of the drums
Stimulated by the sound of my voice, yea ya ready to cum
Dum-du-dum, and all that crap
Bring on any rhyme biter, got a T-Boy rap

[Daddy-O]
4 Ever My Beat, if allowed, I'd play it all year
And if the front was cold, I'd play my beat in the rear
And if the back had a crack, I use my beat like glue
And in the can light beef, I use my beat as stu
My beat is a gem, next to God and the Earth
And all the earthly treasures couldn't measure it's worth
My beats are Lamborghini, being turned as a car
And I eat it like a Ritz eat crackers, ya'll
My beat

[Chorus]
4 Ever My...
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat
My beat forever
4 Ever My....

[Delite]
4 Ever My Beat, for the record, the jam you selected
That when we projected, erect it, perfected
All the way live, yes we in full drive
No jive when I abide, we have a ride
Wit a Stet on the set, us you won't forget
We're leavin' our marks, but cashin' T-Boy checks
So reflect on the text, check out what's next
And groove to the sound, that you is next

[Frukwan]
4 Ever My Beat, this fashion, beat got glitter
The bottom of the ninth, it's the home-run hitter
Never standin' still, it's the up and go getter
Huh, you think I'm frontin' then try to get rid of this
Beat, we'll demolish in a single day
Strike faster than a magazine, ace/duece tray
My beat is a death defying feat
And every mom crack the shell, it's so hard to repeat
My beat-a

[Chorus]
4 Ever My...
My-My-My-My-My beat forever
4 Ever My...
My-My-My-My-My beat forever
My-My-My-My-My beat forever

[Daddy-O]
4 Ever My Beat, when it slides up and down the scale
You would think my beats are graduate from Harvard or Yale
Strappin' other beats five on his way to the top
Havin' radio stations tune 'em up on the charts
Rockin' tum-tums, snares and timbalee's too
Playin' wit Batman, Snuffy and Winnie the Pooh
I do, I catch flu, as my beats boogaluh
And I never saw my beat drop a beat on the crew

[Delite]
My beat for ever, wit this I stand
As a maker of history, across the land
All though it's true that I'm a babe in the music, then
It's a fact on the wax I do cedrin
My beats cut rhyme, makin' you unwind
Prince Paul is droppin' needles, we right on time
Wit not a trace of discrace, cuz his slick, waste
And the bass orchestra all in ya face

[Frukwan]
4 Ever My Beat, sharp fimilatin', hot like fire
In blood 'cated, for my peeps desire
And provide expand to my very last breath
For that, which is a matter of life and death
Camouflage this beat and the'll never get learned
Simmer dark from the beats you've heared
Blow in other state, when our rhyme regulates
It's yellow I oppose, so congragulate, 4 Ever My Beat-a

[Outro]
4 Ever My...
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat
My beat forever
4 Ever My...
Beat, beat
My beat forever
4 Ever My...[ Daddy-O ]
Kick it in, Paul

Yeah

And yes yes y'all

Yo, can we take this up a little higher?
To the next plateau?
Yo D, you wanna show em some freestyle or what?
Aight
I'm goin first, I'm goin first
Check it out

[ Daddy-O ]
Ch-ch-check out the news, never singin the blues
It's your choice, so it takes you to choose
The best in rap, the best in r&b
The best in rock, the best in p-o-p
Who works the hardest, sweats the most
Who was on camera (click-click) and who was the host
I say the Daddy, D-a-double d-y
O - here's another hero
Tryin to stop the flow, I say hell no
It ain't that much stoppin a Rambo
(Prah-prah-prah)
Proceed to give you what you need
Wise words to speak, so take heed
Stompin MC's like a pesty rodent
Outsell em all like Bazooka does Trident
Too much heat? Get the fuck out the kitchen
You'll take a hike, so you better start hitchin
Stop bitchin, you make me wanna laugh
You say my foot's in your ass? It's only half
All the work i've done for years and years
Blood, sweat and no goddamn tears
So let's kick this party from dead to live
Shoot it on up like a Colt .45
MC Delite, if you're number one
Bust a cap in the crowd with your rhymin gun

[ Delite ]
Yo, pop-pop-pop, what a shot, here's another jam
This time around I come again to slam
See I write the songs that makes the young feel proud
I'm workin harder by the sweat of my brow
I've been endowed with the gift to slice the mark
So take part as the four begin to spark
And the pinacle as things get critical
I'm sweatin bullets, but I'm cooler than a popsicle
Pull off a miracle as a black symbol
That overcomes yet any obstacle
I scraped the floor, my knees get scarred
But no way I give in, cause I gotta take charge
Like when my foes wanna make things drastic
I melt em down like real cheap plastic
It ain't no thing, no sweat by me
Cause I know damn well where I wanna be
So join my party if you see things my way
Pick up the album right now today
This year's the year we keep you in gear
And it's clear - blood, sweat, no tears[Intro]
Yo, Prince Paul
("yea")
Bust that groove

[Daddy-O]
Well my name is Daddy-O, so
Want you to know, what you want us to know
When I'm around, I'm doggin' the show

[Delite]
To pimp ya hand slips, I'm set to rip tits
The Rhyme-a-rator, king and I'm runnin' the ship

[Frukwan]
You niggas should leave, well who's that?
"Frukwan!"
I got style and physique, see
Prince Paul, what, what, we know that you got guts
Let 'em know what's up wit the scratch and cut

(Prince Paul scratches it up)

[Daddy-O]
You got on and on and three steps ahead
Hot butter on, say what, the cornbread
Stet start troopin' wit the rhymes galore
You do the patty duke, til you can't no more
Play after dark, and search to come in
You might bump heads wit some of ya friends
And the D.J., he may blow ya mind
D.J. Prince Paul, is one of a kind

[Delite]
With a little pat, we smack and then shellack
To a monk that hates, spit out the fact
That the crew is not a threat to society
But opportunity to make people feel hot beats
So we deliver the fun, take her way down un'
Make people gather round and shake their buns
And we never leave a jam til the job is done
And if you wanna fight that, we could go for some

[Frukwan]
Right to left, you right, he's deaf
Fly girls in the corner, you shootin' ya best
So watch rock the show, so she says no
Cuz she see the Prince Paul, cut sparks'll flow
When these cuts are made, he coincide with the fade
After that's done, that's when we get paid
It's Stet prefect, Prince Paul is direct
And he cut's the old school and that's hi-tech

(instrumentation)

[Daddy-O]
Dip-dip-dive, so-socialize
I didn't teach to throw ya, threw some exercise
We did the push-up, the sit-up, the jumping jacks
And when we went through, we went around the tracks
But when you smoke that crack, you run like a snail
I didn't teach a poet that we goin' to fail
But when the test came, you know we passed
Cuz we the best M.C.'s in the whole gym class

[Frukwan]
Up and down and all around
Now bust the rhythm of the Stetsa sound
Bring if you feel you wants to get snotty
Take a good look at the size of the party
It's six on the mix and Human Percus'
D.B.C. on the keys and the three will discuss, us
Cuz we're the must and the cuts we trust
Grand Wizard Prince Paul is ya vitamin plus

[Delite]
We go back and forth, and forth and back
Wit the rhyme on time, we cuttin' on slack
Wit the chance to advance, and hand yo dash
Wit the rhythm that's flown from U.S. to France
We got the D.B.C. to devastate the keys
And the light skinned brother on the mix machine
It's not a funk machine that cause a heart attack
But the mighty Prince Paul on the old 8-track
It's like that ya'll, as personality wins
Frukwan, Delite, Daddy-O, best friends

[Outro]
"You got the time - I got the time"
"You got the feeling - I got the shit on right..."
"Uh! Uh-Uh-Uh!" - scratched up[ Daddy-O ]
Ah yeah
Smooth dedications goin out to
My man the E Double and the PMD
Special dedications to DJ Scratch
And the Albany Projects in Brooklyn, you know what I'm sayin?

We gonna break it down a little somethin like this here

1, 2, and don't forget the Daddy
O is for the only, chief is for relief
People like to talk about the Hip-Hop Band
Not that they get away with it, but they think they can
Cuttin their eyes, and frownin at Wise
And sayin Paul can't cut - kiss my butt
Don't know Bobby, smirkin at D.B
Boy, stop jockin S-t-e-t
Do what you feel, and if you feel real froggish
Leap on this, so I can bust your lip
Because Allah made man, but man made speech
And speech is only talk, and talk is cheap

[ Delite ]
Well, like a boxer, we got the groove that sticks and moves
Boom! another k.o., and now a major news
No short cuts when it came down to this
Some have wrote us off cause we continued to persist
Without fail, our actions prevail
Success breeds, and the legend unveils
While many pop duty, the Band stood cooly
Till our chance came, and we smashed them rudely
Proved that the soft talk was all pink water
Baked and fried em and threw em all a quarter
Cause when you talk that talk, and your talk is kinda cheap
You reap what you sow, and you sow what you reap

(Action speaks louder than words) (2x)

[ Daddy-O ]
Aiyo, the situation seems very peculiar
Like the Jungle Brothers said: I'm gonna do ya
But I'm not gonna do ya like a guy does a girl
When I do you, I'm gonna crash your world
Lights out, with the click of a switch you're cut off
You can't handle, so you break north
Then I said it before, and I'mma say it again
I'm the Daddy, O is for the wars I win, friend

[ Delite ]
Speaking of a war, yo, I get excited
The taste of victory, man, keeps me ignited
And like a bolt of light that shoots across the darkness
I'm flippin MC's out by my pin-point sharpness
Punishment is due them, I whip em very thorough
I'm servin up the hype like there ain't no tomorrow
The a-c-t-i-o-n means get the job done
MC Delite, now grab hold to my wisdom

(Action speaks louder than words) (4x)

[ Daddy-O ]
Sittin in the park out in East New York
Soak in the sun, watchin the girlies walk
By, some say "Hi", and some say "Hello"
And some say, "How you're doin, Daddy-O?"
I say, "Alright, but the beef I got
Is how the faggot MC's try to cop my spot"
Cause it's cool to occupy your own
But if you come for mine, I'm gonna crash your dome
See, I don't really always wanna be the aggressor
But my respect for MC's continues gettin lesser
And just like my mother used to say in the past
Don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash

[ Delite ]
So just imagine all the flack that you'll be catchin
When you're pop that weak, boy, yo, I be bashin
Rip all your bull, to show that we're winnin
By blood, sweat, no tears, we're provin, not pretendin
We daze and amaze till foes are left confused
Like some men treat their women, they get whipped and abused
Cause Stet is rolling strong, so what the hell goes on
Try to gank this, your ass is gettin bombed
Cause action overspeaks above any plight
Peace, sincerely yours from MC Delite

(Action speaks louder than words) (4x)This one dedicated to the international Stet posse
To the one called Shakalak
(And Aasim)
To the one called Lena
To the one called Nyallah
To the one called the Devastatin Beat Creator
To the one called the Multiple Supreme, the master Fruitkwan
To the one called the Rhymorator MC Delite
To the Grand DJ Wizard Prince Paul
The Human Mix Machine
On the microphone I'm the Ebony Chief Daddy-O
And it goes a little somethin like this

[ *Wise starts beatboxing* ]

[ Daddy-O ]
Well here's a little story with an added surprise
About what took place with me and Wise
Went walkin one morning with our new suits on
Wise in his Adidas, me and my (Benetton)
Coolin out drinkin stout, talkin 'bout the world
When we were suddenly stopped by a beautiful girl
She was gorgeous, she told us that her name was Faye
She would like to get busy for the rest of the day
"Well of course," we replied, "but whose date will you be?"
She said, "(1) or (2), it makes no difference to me"
Whoa, we was with it, had a freak, we could tell
Dialed the first seven digits to the best hotel
In town, rented a room and not a sec too soon
Ordered delicious lunch, about half past noon
After stuffin our face, well, Faye wanted a drink
We ordered up the strongest drink that we could think
After she got a little tipsy I gave Wise the look
Cause we could (smell Faye's tunafish startin to cook)
She started pantin, and breathin, and lickin her lips
And then the next thing you know she was rubbin our hips
Freakin Wise on the bed, freakin me in the corner
I said, "Why Faye, why?" she said ("cause I wanna")
Man, it went on for I don't know how long
I thought that I knew strenght, but that girl was strong
And how I knew her sexy lovin wouldn't steer me wrong?
When she kissed me on the chest, she kissed me on the neck
She kissed me on the cheek and sang this song
She said:
[ *starts to sing* ]
"Higher than the highest mountain
And deeper than the deepest sea
That's how I will love you
So darlin, endlessly.."
Break it down, Wise
She said:
"If you think I'm (sexy)"
Say little boy, reach out and (touch me)
If you really need me
Say little boy, reach out and tell me
And gimme your lovin, gimme your lovin
Don't forget about the all-night squeezin
And don't forget about the huggin and teasin"
- overall it was a good afternoon
(Man, I hope that me and you get to see Faye soon)
You know it, I got some more juice to release
From Daddy-O (and Wise) -
[ both ]
Good night y'all - peace!

Scorpio, and my name is Delite
And the lady that I like
Is one with a classy feel of warmth and sensitivity
Who will be my everyday sunshine
Even on a cloudy day
So if you fit this plan
Grab my hand
And try to understand

From the instant moment I saw your face
You can best do believe my heart began to race
The playboy died and soon I realized
I was stunned by love when I looked into your eyes
Wishful thinkin, wishin you was right here
I'm on fire, I want to hold you near
Your lips are wet and your skin is soft
So let's allow this love to take its course
Float on, girl

Peace
My name is Fruitkwan
And my sign is Virgo
Now what I love in a woman
Is treatin you in a royal manner
For you are queen of royal beauty
That deserves words of treasure
As soon as you come home
I greet you by sayin

Peace queen, your glow is so sweet
You feel so good, you look so unique
And girl, if there's a problem that's too difficult
Fruitkwan, I got the final result
For livin, see
By fulfillin each other's need
My love for you grows, queen, hear my plea
Cause you're my first-place prize
It's all about me and you, don't cry
Float on

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Wise]
Now my name is Wise
And I'm a Leo
And I like a woman
With a realistic imagination
A woman that thinks for herself
Whose thoughts are bold and free
And girl
In your deepest thoughts
This is the key

So just close your eyes, picture the love of your dreams
So listen up, young ladies, this is what I mean
If it's lovin you need to fulfill your blues
Wise Supreme Love is my name to you
The quality you'd expect, it couldn't be beat
Cuddliness you'll always have from me to you, my sweet
With the best of respect, hugs, kisses and charm
Girl, you'll have so much love, you'll float on

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Daddy-O]
Pisces
And my name is Daddy-O
And I like the kind of girl
That loves to get away
You know
Like long trips, weekend cruises in far away places
And if I had my choice
Girl, we'd be in a land of our own

Just think of a land, a lovely land
And in that land I'd take your hand
And walk the shores of love evermore
And ride the waves of life's better days
We'll make a stop every now and then
To enjoy the breeze of the blowing wind
We'll expore what's deep within
And I won't stop till you say when
So float on, girl

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Daddy-O]
A romantic cruise, our hearts we gave
You were the ship, girl, and I was the wave
Passion intense and love undefined
I give you the world just for you to be mine
Pleasure and pain, like a hand in glove
I'm Daddy-O, girl, I'm no stranger to love
But this I confess, in others words I'll imply
That a man can be strong but best believe he can cry
I can't help but think about it, it's the way I feel
A tear may roll down my face because my love is for real
And the love that we share, the moment we embrace
And yes, I knew it was true by the look on my face
Cause the harder the stroke, the higher the love floats
Passion so strong that, girl, it ain't no joke
Some people may say I sing the same old song
But like a ship in the night, you float on

[Hook x2]
Stetsasonic float on
Float on
Float on

(Take my hand and fly away)

Float on
Float on[ Daddy-O ]
If I gotta die to be free
Then I guess it gotta be
Cause I never been a sucker, see?
I can't stand for a man tryin to hold me down
Then again I've never been a clown
Countdown (Freedom or death)
'88, and everything ain't well (Freedom or death)
Prepare for a war and war is hell (Freedom or death)
And if you think about coppin a plea (Freedom or death)
Don't even waste your breath (Freedom or death)
Cause this time it's freedom or death (Freedom or death)

Conceptually to be free means
To do what I please, but please
Cause even overseas in my native country
I still get robbed and raped in the face
For gold and all (Freedom or death)
My people are poor (Freedom or death)
For the sake of a thrill (Freedom or death)
My people get killed (Freedom or death)
And we'll be killed till there's nobody left (Freedom or death)
Unless we understand it's freedom or death (Freedom or death)

It only takes one side to declare war
And if the other side ignores
They get mapped, or should I say off the map
Like a stain's washed out in a laundromat
Wartime, brother, wartime, sister (Freedom or death)
We can't wait because they won't wait (Freedom or death)
And we've been through so much shit to date (Freedom or death)
That we're losin this war and I hate (Freedom or death)

To say that, but it's true, so I say to you
You better learn to defend yourself
Right hand and left
In the east and west
Time for war, freedom or death
If I gotta die to be free
Then I guess it gotta be
Cause I never been a sucker, see?
I can't stand for a man tryin to hold me down
Then again, I've never been a clown
Countdown (Freedom or death)
'88, and everything ain't well (Freedom or death)
Prepare for a war and war is hell (Freedom or death)
And if you think about coppin a plea (Freedom or death)
Don't even waste your breath (Freedom or death)
Cause this time it's freedom or death (Freedom or death)(Girls

Hey when it comes to girls I'm a instant junkie

The kind of girls that keep me swimmin in passion
Who broke the mold when it comes to satisfaction

[ Daddy-O ]
My first taste of Miami Bass
Came on my first tour, this I gotta relate
I was at the hotel, had nothin to do
Flipped on the radio, heard the 2 Live Crew
Started dancin around, left and went downtown
Bought up some mo' shit, cause the shit was down
Then I said to myself: New York ignited the Bass
But in Miami is where they got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Fruitkwan ]
This may be hard to believe
But in Miami I ain't even wanted to leave
I seen a girl so fly, she caught my eye
With her Benzi box kickin a song, give it a try
So she rolled down her tint with a look that said 'come'
I got real close, and then the telephone rung
You couldn't say I wasn't in a serious place
Cause in Miami the girls got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Delite ]
While cooling in Miami in my fresh limo
I seen a fly girl, so I said hello
She was quite polite, so real and so nice
She asked for my name, I said my name is Delite
I said, "Now where do you go on a Saturday night?"
She said, "Downtown, I know the place that's right"
An ace for your taste, a smile for your face
Cause Miami is known for the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Fruitkwan ]
Going for swim when the ocean is rugged
A six plus on my kick is how I love it
Heavy rotated, bass is waded
Radio jocks don't understand how it's rated
Want my opinion? It's all about winning
Cause I think big, and in Miami I'mma dig in
Grab me a piece of what I'll never replace
Cause I still say the girls got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Daddy-O ]
Now know that it's true, from Stetsasonic to you
That we're from New York, our allegiance is true
We're not makin a fuss, but my man, you can trust
That the bass from Miami is a serious must
So loosen up your body, let your mind be free
Forget all your worries, the drink's on me
And after a while we're gonna wiggle our waist
Cause in Miami is where they got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)My rhyme

[ Daddy-O ]
Awaken my conscious to a jubilee
Restore me with everlastin energy
My rhyme does work when I put it to use
Makes me glow when I'm walkin up and down the Deuce
And when I'm shoppin on Delancey buyin brand new gear
Girls always wanna whisper somethin in my ear
At a show old ladies even waitin in line
And it all takes place on the count of my rhyme

My rhyme
Talkin 'bout my rhyme
My rhyme

[ Delite ]
My rhyme is the force of sheer suspense
The stroke of elegance and excellence
The best and no less, seizing in your interest
My rhyme is packed with the muscle and finesse
Satisfaction guaranteed as I get ill
Definitely approved that's a thrill to thrill
My rhyme ??????? the escapade
Or at least as a teacher from my trade
Of my rhyme

[ Fruitkwan ]
My rhyme's wrapped in a fury of hate
And dare a devil rhyme rebel my axe terminate
Subduin and pulverizin suckers from afar
Couldn't sling with the king, I'm a hazardous detour
Break north, suckers, I'm intensively hard
My rhyme is on point cause I stay on guard
It might be quiet, but it's deliberated
And when it rocks the mic, it stays motivated

[ Daddy-O ]
Sayin what I mean, meanin what I say
Hooray, you toot and chant when my rhymes are played
If I may, today, demonstrate my sway
A display like the Grammies shoulda went to Sade
My way, my occupation on the m-i-c
The way I handle my rhyme, they call it mastery
Quakin earth, crashin symbols, ringin bells over towns
And you all wanna come hearin Daddy-O's rhyme
Sucker MC's fear it, my fans all cheer it
My rhyme's a category of personafied lyric
Livin, it tastes, feels, hears and sees
You may not believe it, but my rhyme breathes
It only dresses in the freshest gear
And it never wears words that I wore last year
In the summer you may hear it in L.A. at a show
Or at Miami gettin played at a radio show
My rhyme

[ Fruitkwan ]
My rhyme is devious, but believe me it's
One of a kind, you agree from the previous
Rhymes that you're hearin is devastatin
This rhyme made Tschernobyl stop generatin
After effects of my rhyme gets bolder
It move very swift just like a locomotive
The rhymes I possess can surely produce
To any size, big or small, and I can even reduce
My rhyme

[ Delite ]
Sturdy as a bow, I'm sharp as a arrow
A king among kings, a rhymin pharao
Here to ignite, excite tonight
I'm the daddy of swing, the Rhymorator Delite
Rockin chapter after chapter and saga after saga
Try to battle me, man, don't even bother
I'm reapin and leapin to the highest bound
Shake the walls of hell as I rock the town
With my rhyme

Talkin 'bout my rhymeNow we're gon' get ourselves together

No B.S. allowed

[ Daddy-O ]
Let's get this straight - rappers are a dime a dozen
Some were around from the start, some wasn't
Some are okay on the lyrical tip
But some of these bums, they ain't say shit
I happen to know that some of think they can throw on
Thought we were soft cause of Float On
But we ain't soft, who you think we are, Jeckyll and Hyde?
You been watching too much _Tales from the Darkside_
Or drinking too much, or smoking the crackpipe
Man, instead rag your ass on the mic
So now, me and you face to face, any time and place
Your choice, wanna test your voice
With the O-d-a-d Doctor of -tology
Teacher of youth and MC's without couth
Better call in a bomb squad, cause I'm gonna blow
You and your voice and your rhyme out the window
Fall and you break and you cook and I bake and you cry
You know why? Cause you was a dumb guy
To sleep on the Stet for some political rep
You thought we would miss the boat, but you joked
The time has come for you to face the fact
You slept, hops, cause you thought we was wack
But we're back, and it's a fact, cause we have vowed
In the world of Stet - no B.S. allowed

[ Daddy-O ]
No B.S. allowed
[ all ]
No B.S. allowed (repeated)

Take that y'all
From the back y'all
We're not the wack y'all
Beat, beat y'all
And you don't stop
Ya keep, ya keep on
Rockin the hip-hop

(And it goes a little somethin like this...)

[ Wise ]
Next in line to rhyme, and on time
Outline a fine rhyme that'll blow your mind
You see, well, it's me, Wise emceeing
And every line you hear, I'm writing for me and
Myself, and I bet that you can give me a try, gee
Here's another headpiece I fly
Underestimated our ability
So comprehend the trend that we set
To ache and take and break the mold that we're from
Cause sucker MC's wanna try to get some
Peace to the allies, forget the foes
Praisin and glazin, but I'm grazin
More than just nips, I'm goin for chunks
Kickin off a fresh rhyme to a beat that's funky
Splurgin on the style, you feel you gotta
So let loose, sucker, and ???
Why do you even bother?
To call our shit junk
From the bottom of heart
When you was biting from the start
Of it all, punk
Give me a break, there's no mistake here
Your girl'll be the only thing I take
Yo, S-t-e-t is the band symbol
Wise a/k/a the Stetsa sex symbol
Rockin the crowd with no B.S. allowed

[ Daddy-O ]
No B.S. allowed
[ all ]
No B.S. allowed (repeated)

(And it goes a little somethin like this...)

[ Delite ]
So now, time to flex some lyrical muscle
Rip up ours with ??? scuffle
Hustle and tussle with the best of them
Blow thsyelf a Philly and commence the stompin
R.O. D-e-l-i-t-e
The poet is me, a poetry epitome
Here to stimmulate, to teach and educate
And those who perpetrate, I bend your path straight
Point blank, by the line that tells it all
Hell could freeze and the Stet would still reign tall
Cause our flow is soul and so electro
From my intro pooh-puts are petrol
We strom the stage, rip it kinda slick
A little silver, yeah, we on a different tip
About our silver - our crown to our glory
You wanna know - read the real story
And plug in to the smooth reservoir
Complete funky freestyle seminar
Don't ever try to diss us on any issue
Or you'll be outta here like used wet toilet tissue
For the Stet it's cool, we're never living foul
Step wrong, we'll be gankin and buckin wild
Cause we're the band, we're standin loud and proud
And where we're from, no B.S. allowed

[ Daddy-O ]
No B.S. allowed
[ all ]
No B.S. allowed (repeated)[Chorus: MC Delite]
On fire, on fire, on fire
On fire, on fire, on fire
On fire, on fire, on fire

[Daddy-O]
We were born to be on, got strong and life-long
Our element of song, could never steer you wrong
We attack like a fleet, and burn like the heat
We win like a champ and the victory is sweet
We drive like a drill, we soothe like a pill
We consume till we're filled, opposition is nill
We speak to attain unattainable feats, and I'm rockin to the beat
Y'all and you don't quit, as I rely solely upon my wit
To help me say this rhyme for I forget
And rock much parties till skies are lit
Cause it's a sure hit from my rhymin' kit
While other MC's takin a stand I sit
And if a jam gets ill I'll deal with it
Cause I'm as hot as hot could ever get
And I'm not a nitwit when I throw a Stet fit
I hear em yellin and yellin (Daddy-O is legit)
And I don't smoke crack cause I'm not with it
The crew is crack-free and we'll admit it
Stet's been stickin out a stake for style
And on the mic we a-fi wicked and sometimes wild
We are the ones that'll take you higher
We're the band called Stet (my man) and we're on fire

[Chorus]“So Let The Fun Begin” (remixes) b/w “Peace” “Hip Hop Band”

Tommy Boy Records
Production: Artist
Rating: 3

Stetsasonic, Brooklyn’s own original hip-hop band, has been one of the most consistent and underrated groups around. They get due respect from the hip-hop nation as one of the elite, but they haven’t seemed to blow up like most of their contemporaries. “So Let The Fun Begin” is another solid single from the Blood, Sweat, and No Tears LP. The jams on this record may not be anything incredibly new or ground breaking but those who already appreciate the Stetsa sound will be satisfied, while the masses continue to sleep on them.

     There are two remixes of ”So Let…” and neither of them is very different from the album version. The first remix has an extra piano break added and the second slams with a new guitar loop and heavier bass in the drums. The highlight of the single is the instrumental track “Hip Hop Band,” which features Prince Paul cutting up the names of the group members over a sampled horn, bass, and drums which sound like George Clinton’s live version of “Do That Stuff.”

     These two tracks, and the previously unreleased “Peace,” feature Stet’s patent mix of samples and live instruments, which continue to set them apart from other groups. Stet also continues to mix old school style into their rhymes, especially on “Peace,” which features a lot of “Yes, yes, y’all” type of rhymes. Both “Peace” and “So Let…” remind me of tracks like “This Is It Y’all” from their last album. Stet refuses to sell out, and their latest efforts should disappoint the many fans they’ve already gained.
