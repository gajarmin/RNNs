[Busdriver]
The world cannot be saved, children
Your hero's bloodshed is sponsored by the sphinx's coonery under the monster eye

[Mikah-9]
Walk like an Egyptian
Keep some pep about your step
The petty thievery
A pet peeve to me
Grief over leaving me
Queasy, easily, measly, freebie Frisbee
Sizzles in cold stream wilderness
Epic, relic, medic, antiseptic tank quarantine
Celtic elfin magic melted in that kiln
Overwhelm your film
Hold the realm by the helm
Put you in a gimp suit plastic pillow case
Pimp loot prostitutes knock boots in duke shoot Luke cute
Killing off shallow personalities
I rebuke on purpose
I set it, plan, and plot
Puke on planet Earth
If I was a fifth, you'd drink me
If I was a spliff, you'd stink me
If I was a myth, you'd think me
If I was a lift, you'd sink me
If I was a gift, you'd jinx me
Sphinx riddle as taboo
Culture clash bamboo
I'm a damn fool
The baby in your baby momma's belly got my sperm shampoo
If infant was hip-hop and womb of time
Recording room for rhyme
Leverage your average beverage
Severage causes heritage hemorrhage at a measure which the feathers itch
Gathers rich overages whether its reverence is togetherness
I never miss a chance to tether twist a stance
Fake independents take advantage of a zephyr kiss
The sound of their soul is tainted with devilness

[Busdriver]
Dying, we did it well
We put diving boards on the mouth of forever and ever
And MTVs reenact our martyrdom with marginal liberals but we're the artful pit bulls

[2 Mex]
Get the fuck out of my genre
It's my alma mater
Styles from my mama who do these piles of towels from a Ramada
Who think Illuminati but drink limonada
Persona non grata
Think there zoning on strata
Got a lot of Erik Estrada but not a lot of Akuma Matata
In and out of water like a piranha on a Prada or Dolce and Gabbana piñata
Waiting to Mexhale
Your girls in a Hyundai Excel
One lie away from writing me letters on Microsoft Excel
Cause and effect sales
Rhymes is ice in effect
Hail to the thief
Mail order some new teeth
Impailed through the Mexperiment
Underneath the burial reef
Carry a note and not a leaf
I'm an a anomaly
You're Amelie and you've got to leave
The dichotomy of your dye job is not godly
But oddly more runway modelly

[Busdriver]
I'm mistaken for the next Kool Keith
Because I interbreed indie rap acts and groom them at the pet boutique
But I'm stupid
I turn down test tube freak bleach blondes
Offering sex on a nude beach
To read palms for prep school geeks
Cause they sing along to each song
Why only do I appreciate the therapeutic properties of a sexy whore?
Is it because my vacant heart is a messy sore
Encased in an unrefined heavy ore?
It's exactly why jet fuel leaks out of my every pore
And rhymers can't even ingest the food I eat anymore
They would need six stomachs, a big budget and crisp hundreds
To bribe hand-picked judges
To share the winnings of the post-rap whiz kid
I'm a steaming blue baby
Hovering over a bigwigs business grid
My ideas go down smoothly
When you guzzle an Odwalla
My speech is littered with double entendres
And sharp sarcasm
I'm coupled with top sponsors
My tame ideas are on the wall of a chain of IkeasBarely Music

Awol One:
Because the meaningless jargon jigsaw word phrase thesaurus battle raps chatter voice-box detox
I’m a microphone vet
Awol is a creature of God
Forever in a day
I throw up on my stupid rhyme book sketches
Because all those words that they spit
Silly immortal
Hip-hop is universal
If you’re poetic
It’s nothingness
Maybe me
It’s me with a lightening scar on my fucking forehead because there’s no music that wouldn’t have a voice
If there was no hip-hop then we wouldn’t have a choice
I believe it like it’s paranormal
It’s barely music
It’s like the ttttaaaa..!!!!!!! gets locked in the domains insane
I'm a positive against negative
My infrared robotic eye can hear from the acne meat factory all the faces of death
Come and see us and see what’s left

(Busdriver)
What is this music called? Technological animal chew-toy
It’ll send a rude boy to etiquette class
It’ll give a flu-shot to a 2Pac impersonator
Even a first grader can see I had a probable cause to shoot everyone at the inaugural ball
And squabble with dogs until they had to hobble on their paws for saying this is barely music
I’m an informative pez dispenser knocking the fez off the senator
So get off my hairy pool stick or get a mule kick in the dead center of your Jerry Lewis smile grin
They fed The Weather clip-out coupons for discounts on the crew song
But I dismount your nude mom
And I made you with various birth defects
You don’t disserve respect
When I bleed blood and write my rhymes on a Chinese rug
And you take the tape
And you put it on high-speed dub
And you share it with your friends
Talking about
“this is what my daddy does
He’s a LA underground G
And like him I want to be an MC." When around me you form elliptical orbits
Your umbilical chord gets clipped and your navel stitched
And I realign your satellite cable dish
And no you can’t record with Daedelus
Get away you wailing bitch
You’ve been taken off the mailing list and given a bag of bagel chips for workers comp
I’m a Leimert (Park) cop and you’re a tiny rapper under protective custody of The Weather

(Radioinactive)
I know that this could be disturbing to some people
Throwing wooden Frisbees across this suburban easel
Louise and Ernesto will wait for escrow
And make some pesto
And hand painted t-shirts
Eat deviled eggs for several days and finish with Danish desserts
You're the famous Eater Bunny
I heard you owe Jesus money
Is it dangerous to bleach your teeth? I’ve paid much more for cheaper seats
When she plays ping pong
She plays for keeps

(2Mex)
Dr. Octopus
Detroit
Demento
Octave all of us deployed essential
Sequence
She can wince
Be convinced
Be pollen
But believe all
And forget outer
It gets louder
Orchids
Flowers
Time-lapse photography
Lying maps on all of me
Co-ordinance
Board immense
Afford the fence
Master lock
Castle rock entertainment
Massive jocks under a payment
Wonder where the winter of days went
Night-school stalker
Fight through the talker
Chameleon
Calm alien bomb through the dawn
Snow flake
Know the date
Not home to take
Survey surveillance
Were they in cadence
We stay cognate
They spray inhalants into the audience
Listening all against God glistening
Mom missing me
I’m missing her

(Circus)
A few years ago
A friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
Well
Imma say the rhyme I’m about to say
The rhyme was the bomb and it went this way
And so the next day came and I heard that someone said that hip-hop was dead
Hmm
Is that the case?
Is hip-hop dead?
Like
No way dude
I can already read your mind
So I know what your thinking
Dog
By the way I got your girl’s head nodding
We keep the party crunkulating with this funky type of abstract rhythms
Hmm
What’s this monster that you’ve created
Hmm
It seems I made a new type of undestructible wack MC creature in my funky-ass laboratory
It was designed to scream and moan just like a torture bitch on the M-I-C
Over a beat that sounds just like a clone off this one
Check it out
I push record and then you extend your arms and you begin to walk just like a zombie in the direction of the mall
And then you pick it up
And then you buy it up
And then you stuff it in to your mouth and then you eat it up
And it tastes good
And then this creepy sound comes seeping out between the cracks of your teeth
Boom-box
Yeah
That too
It spits a dog-eared pitch that emits a strange and bizarre frequency that can hypnotize and convince a barely legal coke whore to get in the trance
And do the forbidden dance
And that’s why you like it so much
Yeah
The jokes on you
The yolks on your face
Cause I tricked you into thinking that this was actually dope
Cool
Stuff
When all along it really wasn't
Ha
Ha
Ha
He
He
He
Y'all are some whomptee
Me so horny
Y'all so crazy
You're stupid for believing that this was really music

Breath in the blessings
Excel all the guessing
Don't leave before the lessons lessen
Believe in your self and not a yeses essence
Stretching the limits of all our dream
While etching your image upon my screen
You love much better in person
Above my head I touch letters in cursive
I drug myself pack the knife
Then I hug my self-back to life
Even though I'm broke as ever
Hope this rope between our spirits never sever
Im holding on tight
Singing these golden songs of light
Tonight broadcasting from all locations

Carry yourself over the finish line
Don't be afraid of the powers that climb over your mental towers
See its ok to be a silly teen
2Mex is everywhere like the legend of Billie jean

Here we go..

Leggo my ego, the mic stand the easel
Paint words lethal, tough like cheap wool
Snuff film b-roll, fuck til she know
Ivan so ill, I'm illegal
And no, when it comes to flow, we're not equal
I never miss, like God shooting free throws
I won't fall off the bike like Evil Kanievel
And I won't fall off the mic like Beanie Segal
Hip Hop is dead? Nah, I don't think so
I'm Russian Red, not a Pinko
My aims is lofty, I never think low
Cats try to copy, like they was Kinkos
God is hidden, he won't let me see him
But the Devil will shake my hand, so Carpe Diem
I murder without noticin, herder with doubt hopin and
I be a word merger with stout motioning

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!

[2Mex]
2Mex
Los Angeles lyrical lottery
Don't bother me when it comes to dissin common camaraderie
Me and Ivan Ives we straight roll off
Like my homie Daniel and Ivan Koloff
Making these weak motherfuckers just straight hold off
We doing it big, taking your girls coat off
So very often I have the option to coughing on your coffin
You're soft and known for straight sobbing
Bobbin and weaving believe me
These fools with bobby pins in their weave don't believe em
Their happy to be still breathing
Another reason this rap game is so fucking uneven
Heaving these fools out the house like Jazzy Jeff
Stab em in the back cause he was wack as he left
I'm FRESH to death
Even in Moscow
2Mex and Ivan Ives we rock stars and we all style

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!

[Ivan Ives]
We grew up on Hip Hop, you threw up on Hip Hop
Stay away from the mic if your name is Rick Ross
It's kind of on some oh shit, don't front, open, your lungs
Smokin, those blunts
Of course I'm good at Tetris and Chess
I'm Russian, what the fuck you expect?
I been bustin' my ass, now I'm here to collect
Ivan Ives and 2Mex, protect your neck, uh

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!

[Scratch Outro][Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride"
So I
Hop inside

[Verse One] [Murs]:
She said she never did it before
So we did it before
She changed her mind, because she seemed unsure
Pure
Ecstasy I gave her my legacy
Woke up the next mornin', and you know what she said to me?
"We only fuck. You don't really love me
We never make love and that makes me feel ugly
You push and you shove me, you pull my hair
Grab me around the throat then you choke me and stare."
You stare at me like you hate me, so do you?
That look in your eyes seems like I never knew you
Like every other week I receive the same speech
Cause she's feelin' guilty cause she really a freak
So when she's off to work, I'm makin' somethin' to eat
I sneak and put rose petals all over the sheets
Turn on some slow jams and we have simple sex
And the very next night we back to the triple X

[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride"
So I
Hop inside

[Bridge]:
She puts her hands in the air
Like she's reachin' for clouds
But she won't sit down, cause she's screamin' so loud

[Verse Two] [2Mex]:
She's so hard to stay away from
My friends always say I'm dumb and that she's dangerous
But I'm so insane I trust my lust for her
Other girls are a lackluster blur
She wack, but I always end up thrustin' her
Against the wall
Fuckin' her should be against the law
The contradictions in her are the contradictions of us all
With that ADHD, I'm like, "Baby it's me
Can I ABC/see you out of that baby tee?"
There's no maybe G, she's fuckin' crazy
And that's the fuckin' trick, that we be fuckin' crazy
I'm losin' it
I'm think she's startin' to phase me
Every time I leave her she looks at me like, "Save me."

[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride", so I
Hop inside

[Bridge]:
She puts her hands in the air
Like she's reachin' for clouds
But she won't sit down, cause she's screamin' so loud

[Verse Three] [Murs]:
She's got split personalities, she ruined my life
It's like I wifed one chick and got two for the price
I really wanna leave her but I thought about it like
If I wanna break up, then I gotta call her twice

[2Mex]:
She's bi-polar, bi-sexual and buy's me issues of my favorite comics
When my sinks dirty she buys me Comet
Whatever I need, homie, she's on it
A woman like this, is rarely seen like Hailey's Comet
But then she changes up, just like a Coin Star
Tell me we're not goin' far like I don't even know who you are
And this ain't workin' right
When last night she complimented me of how I was workin' it right
Damn Sybil
Always givin' me mixed signals
Do you wanna be single or do you wanna be under my wing
Go away
If you're really going to stay
Stop tellin' me you love me and don't in the same day

[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride", so I
Hop inside[*Answering machine message*]

Baby doll are you down

[Verse 1: 2Mex]
Hey yo thank you
For coming out to the sound check
I haven't even started running around yet
We just got here not to long ago
Is it me or did your hair get longer? No?
Why do you still think we met on the legends tour
I know I met you before that I'm just not sure
I think I met you on the flow and tell
I think we just said what's up to each other we didn't know each other
That well
Anyway
Why don't you take me away for part of the day
I'm down if you roll a j
Yo just take me away from this tour van
I'd love to walk around the city holding your hand
So is it all right if I stay with you so
I can pocket the money the promoter gave me for the hotel
Cool you're the best
No ones gonna take that away from you yes yes
So what up now I heard you have a man now
Hey that's cool whatever
I understand how you get lonely yo
Busdriver told that on the other tour you came to his show with some homie
Hey that not your man no more?
That not my business what happens
I'm just letting you know I know that it happened
Hey I know your in the mix
Don't front it sucks we only get to kick it once
Every 6 months
Lets not talk about that tonight
Shoot me back to the venue cuz I got to go rock the mic
Yo really though
I got to get to work
But its so cute you came to my show wearing my shirt
No I don't think that your stalking me its funny
How you chased away the only other girl that wanted to talk to me
But for real though its cool
All the love an affection your giving me is cool
Thank you
For all the drawing pictures and letters
Thank you for letting me kick it with you tonight whatever
Yeah I know you wanna talk about that song
I haven't thought about it in so long
I don't know if you like me or just my music
I like looking in to your eyes just like a muse
Its an even trade
Believe me if I could I would have stayed in a room we haven't made in the shade

[Verse]
Los Angeles lungs, love in lower lights
Oceans of organic opals overwright
Subliminal sorcerers satellite

Attempt sacrificion after life, after light
Not natural night
Giggling girls, gigabytes
Earth ending, extraterrestrial heights
Lyrically lines lynch the laptop leopard
Each execution emphasizes effort
Synonym surgery, satellite sits

Heatedly(?), I'm hearsay, hollow point hits
Indigenous idiosyncrasies
Pulling pistols upon political enemies

Hard-hider(?) holding Hell's history
Older organs, odd and ?older league?
Pathological purgery

World wide emergency, why wouldn't we
Introduce ideas instantly, intricately
Live and lift off a linear leaf
Leveling off illogically

Several sonic subjects asleep
All audible angels alive asking
Vibrate invisible visionary vaccine
Escape exactly

Tackling those that try to track me
Heartfelt hello to hard heroes hacking
Everyone evolve, elevate eye

"We won" is worth the wait, we wonder why
Obstacle absorb outside
Re-revolutionize your rubbery ride
Leave losers lurking in levels of lye
Don't doubt dissention, deserters will die

[Outro]
Word, word... word, word, word, word
Word, word... word, word, word, word
Mum's the... (x8)Baby I ain't joking
And its not what I'm smoking
I really think your nice (*4X*)

[2Mex]
We are the love that is hard to love
My name is 2Mex metaphor Mork from ork
Looking for my monogamous Mindy
While your girl envy
Desire a girl to befriend me
But not to entirely up in me
I have pictures of a woman that I love in an album day dreaming of a
Different out come
I wear my art on my sleeve
As hard as it seems my heart rips apart at the seams and bleeds

[Awol One]
Some times she's so beautiful
Its like when ever she's angry
But why would someone who's so pretty and smart
Fall in love with an underground MC

[2Mex]
Ha!
I took you to the darkleaf concert
You said you never heard of them
How cool is that
So I went to your room and read your diary
Took you to the how and showed you turntables
And then my heart stared listening to hip hop blends
Yo fall in love all over again

Baby I ain't joking
And its not I'm smoking
I really think you're nice (*2X*)

[Awol One]
She doesn't have the Cinderella syndrome
Hard like a drummer summer color skin tone
Shes like a cardiac still beating
From the top of the cloud to the bottom of the reef
The shark smells blood from a mile a way
Shes like a beautiful mermaid with legs
Well I love you so much that I'm hating your guts
And all I need is your everlasting touch

[Awol One]
Some times she's so beautiful
When ever she's angry
But how could someone so pretty and smart
Fall in love with an underground MC

[Awol One]
You stuck your head on my chest and you ripped out my heart
While its still beating in your hands
When it gets broke it won't heal or recover
Its this point in time this love we discover
I'm crossing my t's
And dotting my i's
And signing my name in blood
Waters thicker than mud
It never helped to bring up the past
I talk so slow cause my mind moves fast
Because
Some times she so beautiful
It's like when ever shes angry
But why would someone who's so pretty and smart
Fall in love with an underground MC

Baby I ain't joking
And its not I'm smoking
I really think your nice (*2X*)

We are the love thats hard to love
We are the love thats hard to love
We are the love thats hard to love
We are the love thats hard to love[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yeah... my name is Priest...
I come from a galaxy...

[Killah Priest]
The great blunt cloud
Drift through his dark cold nostrils
While intoxicated thoughts fly like jets through the weak storms
We calm with Hennessey, written on the side
Picasso, my art flow, my flow never dies
Eyes Wide Shut with sluts, I fucked them, in all positions
Leave nuts on their chins in menage et troises, blase blah
Lord forgive our soul as it drifts through the infinite hole
The judgment, the covenant
I speak on subjects from a thug's death
Devils with pitchforks lift the corpse from the eternal fire
I sit across the mother and the messiah
The holy one told me to come
Outer body experience, not worried, released or tense
Now I'm in a dark age, periods, but curious
A knight in the night on the black horse while bats cross my face
Lost my way, wearing nothing but satin cloths
Rats eating at my face, I take my gats off the waist
From Then Till Now, the globe still spins around
The watchers are sent to the ground
In the likeness with Christ's bliss, I write this
(Another world) poem, under another name I'm...

[Hook: Killah Priest]
(Circles)
The Earth spins in (circles)
The smoke rings go in (circles)
The energy flows in (circles)
The clock flows in (circles)
The Earth spins in (circles)
The early morning wind's in (circles)
Smoke rings in (circles)
Energy flows in (circles)

[The Last Emperor]
West Philly really on that you can quote me
In Arizona, homey, I hoo-dance with the Hobey
I leave the track smoking until the great circle is broken
Everything is copacetic and cosy, but uh...
The galaxy is governed to certain emotions
Whether in a cypher getting right with your old friends
Or tight fit, nice whip on some chrome rims
Or flipping bricks big enough to fit Stonehenge
What goes around comes around then revolves
It's called karma, yes, the universal law
From The Last Em', Jamal, dominating overall
Still shining like the wheel that Ezekiah saw
It was a circle, life and death meet in the streets
Form a circle, ionic particles of heat
They come in circles, now our cypher is complete
In a circle, Last Emperor and Killah Priest

[Hook: The Last Emperor over "circle" samples]
This is.. hot raps that'll impact ya chest
Everything in motion comes to rest
Even the condor builds his nest
Then a plasma plaque or patch to the west

[2Mex]
2Mex hip-hop opera part two, plot part deep, part copra
Unstoppable, cops just popped Hoffa
Now there's no stopping of the blood to mop up
Still burn, Children of the Corn still crop up
I'm as revolutionary, had the flu shot
You motherfuckers still living in the blue shot
The solution, to control the whole of the soul
Of the loose gun, man in the trance, translucent
The ones, some of the pawns, send the militant hunts
And then there's the haunts
Around the necks of your uncle and your aunts
The renaissance of the science, and the sonnets
The sauna of the mind switch, defiance in the sonics
The age of enlightenment and the dawn is upon us
Even in the age of electronics they still warn us

[Hook: 2Mex]
The Sun moves in a circle
My aura glows in a circle
The spaceship is a circle
You can't touch my inner circle
Your black eye is a circle
The gunshot is a circle
This wedding ring is a circle
And everything is a circle (X5)[Intro]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes (x5)

Word, word... word, word, word, word
Mum's the... (x8)God, I'm ready
To essentially become a melody in your medley
I'm an elevated entity
Contaminated energy, laminated mentally
As the faith of the world grows thin
I dance in a trance all night and become him
One win does not equal one wind
Run into the shade of the gun that the sun sends
Dug in, I'm done with this skin
Ready to become one within, candle in
Grandmother moon, come home soon
Mushroom and bloom over this gloom and doom
And, uh, open the room and put hope in the womb
I can't cope in this tomb, isotopes in my Zooms consume
Along with the notes from this tune, I'm supposed to be doomed
I'll be compost in June
Dead and buried
Well-read and married, led and carried
To the belief that I will one day be a leaf
Not even the will to live should ever kill to give
Elaborate labyrinth maverick
Collaborative aboriginal tablets of Arabic
I am the ambiance in a fabulous ambulance

And it WILL stop (x12)
And it WILL...
"You sympathize, you express concern, hiding behind ???? visions of
Eternal light... so afraid to face reality" (sampled film dialogue)

Another awesome Autumn blossom
In the bottom overwhelming colorfast, pulverizing mother mass
Life is too short to be sad
And knives are the sport of the mad and, uh, sort of a fad
Follow through to swallow you
Conflict of interests inflict the intrinsic
I have bricks and fabrics
And carefully place the words a dabble and babble with
Pivotal, digital nature
If you fidget or are not original then I hate you
Progress is Our guess, Our guess is no less
Note to know less and got to focus
Plot to process, the end is in
Let's defend the friendless against ten defendants
An appendage of independence
Always at advantage with my attendance
Reminder that even blind we're not a blur
Show him that to know wind is to grow in
I'd rather be more in than way all out
I can't fathom pouring a tall glass of doubt
Soar over the core of a nuclear fall out
And you hear me call out:

And it WILL stop[Busdriver]
The world cannot be saved, children
Your hero's bloodshed is sponsored by the sphinx's coonery under the monster eye

[Mikah-9]
Walk like an Egyptian
Keep some pep about your step
The petty thievery
A pet peeve to me
Grief over leaving me
Queasy, easily, measly, freebie Frisbee
Sizzles in cold stream wilderness
Epic, relic, medic, antiseptic tank quarantine
Celtic elfin magic melted in that kiln
Overwhelm your film
Hold the realm by the helm
Put you in a gimp suit plastic pillow case
Pimp loot prostitutes knock boots in duke shoot Luke cute
Killing off shallow personalities
I rebuke on purpose
I set it, plan, and plot
Puke on planet Earth
If I was a fifth, you'd drink me
If I was a spliff, you'd stink me
If I was a myth, you'd think me
If I was a lift, you'd sink me
If I was a gift, you'd jinx me
Sphinx riddle as taboo
Culture clash bamboo
I'm a damn fool
The baby in your baby momma's belly got my sperm shampoo
If infant was hip-hop and womb of time
Recording room for rhyme
Leverage your average beverage
Severage causes heritage hemorrhage at a measure which the feathers itch
Gathers rich overages whether its reverence is togetherness
I never miss a chance to tether twist a stance
Fake independents take advantage of a zephyr kiss
The sound of their soul is tainted with devilness

[Busdriver]
Dying, we did it well
We put diving boards on the mouth of forever and ever
And MTVs reenact our martyrdom with marginal liberals but we're the artful pit bulls

[2 Mex]
Get the fuck out of my genre
It's my alma mater
Styles from my mama who do these piles of towels from a Ramada
Who think Illuminati but drink limonada
Persona non grata
Think there zoning on strata
Got a lot of Erik Estrada but not a lot of Akuma Matata
In and out of water like a piranha on a Prada or Dolce and Gabbana piñata
Waiting to Mexhale
Your girls in a Hyundai Excel
One lie away from writing me letters on Microsoft Excel
Cause and effect sales
Rhymes is ice in effect
Hail to the thief
Mail order some new teeth
Impailed through the Mexperiment
Underneath the burial reef
Carry a note and not a leaf
I'm an a anomaly
You're Amelie and you've got to leave
The dichotomy of your dye job is not godly
But oddly more runway modelly

[Busdriver]
I'm mistaken for the next Kool Keith
Because I interbreed indie rap acts and groom them at the pet boutique
But I'm stupid
I turn down test tube freak bleach blondes
Offering sex on a nude beach
To read palms for prep school geeks
Cause they sing along to each song
Why only do I appreciate the therapeutic properties of a sexy whore?
Is it because my vacant heart is a messy sore
Encased in an unrefined heavy ore?
It's exactly why jet fuel leaks out of my every pore
And rhymers can't even ingest the food I eat anymore
They would need six stomachs, a big budget and crisp hundreds
To bribe hand-picked judges
To share the winnings of the post-rap whiz kid
I'm a steaming blue baby
Hovering over a bigwigs business grid
My ideas go down smoothly
When you guzzle an Odwalla
My speech is littered with double entendres
And sharp sarcasm
I'm coupled with top sponsors
My tame ideas are on the wall of a chain of Ikeas[Intro: ?]
Ayy [?]!
[?]!
No man I'm serious man
You gotta fall back on that
You gotta get cha' soul back jack
Yo

[Verse 1: ?]
Armed [?] looking for the PCP
Riding backwards off the handlebar on the twelve speed
Floatin' around, holdin' on from the last high
Below sea levels, swimmin' fast with the Devil
Fire to the metal, spoon then zoom
Fire that make you expire more than soon
No family, foundation, a sick patient
His past health grades are sayin' he's been spacin'
Full blown comatose, he's always in a cloud of smoke, on the roast
Dusted,no swiffer, busted up the zipper
Rusted at the lip he couldn't do it for the [?] (nah nah nah nah nah)
'Till the wheels fall off, a piece of his soul is lost every time he coughs
Make zombies look lively when he gets that fix
Broken down spirit trapped in his skin (uh)

[Verse 2: ?]
Angel dust ain't strange to us
Things that are dangerous are within range for us
[?] Park
Watching the dealers bust
Hollywood Boulevard where tweakers cuss with crust in their eyes
I'm a night tripper in disguise, fiending for a [?]
Sittin' [?]
Forbidden candy, in the Camry, not worried about what can or can't be
Tryna defuse her like John Candy
John Belushi, Gorked out but not loosely, you wanna wet out? lick a square of my loose leaf
South Central liquor store lucys, skinny dip until the chemicals induce me
Introduce me to the beast that got it all started
The shit is hittin' harder than Joe Jackson on the dawn of a talent show
Smoke that tickin' time bomb, get my palms [?] slow
See the homie but he's not really there
Tryna' have a conversation with the ghost not there
It's like I'm stuck and the lights are off and I'm locked [?]

[Verse 3: ?]
That's the Devil's work, take it and let it work
It ain't got nothin' to do with angels
It's just strange people doing strange things in weird places
My people, angel dust don't play (don't play)
Have you moonwalkin' in the middle of the freeway
Don't believe what your friends say, my pops
Told me back in the mix, before crack came
It was wattaheads, trippin' off of sherm sticks (sherm sticks)
They call it out on your feet, have a nigga runnin' butt naked down the street
Didn't know that you like to get wet
It's smokin' all the water that'll get you get you wet
Ready set put it on the end of your cigarette
Have you shakin
' on my front lawn, molly ain't got shit on (on on on on)
Say it (angel dust dust)[2Mex]
Foul play
On a summer day bumping De La Soul its a Saturday!
Without the roller skates
Threes no doubt the sun shouts out my daily solar fate
Must get up to motivate
There too much hope out there to cultivate
In this world and out the stratosphere
I'm looking at this girl like yo kiss me out of here
Don't care if your out of beer
Lets go to the trendy spots
And outdated gear
Let the posh
Of the Oshkosh
I paid the cost of the mosh pit to be a lost cause
Lets hit the in-in-out
At the end of the night we get through the old in-in-out
That would be something to dream about
But thats not what I'm really all about
In a crowded room your name I'm calling out
I'm about to bloom in this game ?????
Don't get me wrong and don't put on your make up yet
Lets fight again so that we can have make-up sex
I'll put the Elliot smith in the CD changer
Put your slit back on ill be the city stranger
No need to role play
Just roll with me and well be OK!

[2Mex]
Lets have a friendship uh slash relationship
And if it ends and crashes well just say it isn't shit
Don't say it was wack because you never really know
We might just get back together
You know all of our friends hate us
No one else in Los Angeles wants to date us
You go out with pretty boys and dress up
I go out with a pretty girl that lives to dress up
Is that what you want?
We both know that this is messed up
Yo I'm ready to roll if you would fess up
I can't talk about you no more
I'm looking at the from door
Can't waste my time trying to convince her
Hey! I just met a new girl on friendster
Word up yo
She likes the eels
This girl knows exactly how I feel[Verse One: LMNO]
I'm the luggage packer
Carson traveler
Deciding factor
Occasional slacker
Which came first, The vinyl or the lacquer?
I'm a rhythm attracter
Flabbergasted, we outlasted forever after
Hearing hateful laughter
LMNO is a word crafter
From inner Earth, not outer space, the out laster
As a fan, I hear too much blabber
Too many jaws jabber
Gear never made the rapper, reminder
In order to fit, get the adapter
I see them drunk off their own wine, I'll be the cracker
Revelation 22, close up the chapter

[Big Oak]
I be the next up to bat, wide open stance
Lead the league in dope rhymes and leaving MC's no chance
I swing a hefty mic and carry with it lofty goals
That's why I write these pieces and put off my thesis
My verbal attack will leave rappers off balance
They talk about a challenge, but uh, where's their talent?
Mine is intact from this track that's apparent
Heard from this assault well it's clearly our fault
It's Leo, bruises ego's on the low
Precision incision from subterranean position
Joined by these five wordsmiths
We're here to outshine and surpass all those upsurd hits
And finally, to all the non believers
It's time to realize that this fam runs deep like wide receivers

[Kazi]
I'm like a warpath genius, dropping science for a living
So catch me in my dungeon mixing chemicals with treason
I got the remedy, better yet the main ingredient
So stop your run force, cause to me you're disobedient
I mean this
I'm no joke
I got it to a science
Lyrically I'm here to tell brothers to stop trying
The ill motivator, hear me now and see me later
Strictly staying underground, that's how I make my meal paper
Check my method capability, turn you into oddity
You're faking jacks cat, so to me you're just an enemy
Brah, I stay high without the negative charge
Keep my skills elevated, why you biting my bars?
Oh yeah, I leave you something that your crew can feel
Kamicause the mastodon better guard your grill

[Hook] {x2}
DJ's
Rock the beat with your hands
MC's
Rock the mic if you can
LMNO
And the Lexicon
Kazi, Iriscience, SonGodSuns

[Verse Two: Rakaa Iriscience]
Ayo I passed crazy cattle, rode in, blazing saddles
Half [?] and half looking for battle
Gemini divided
Hexagon, six sided
Dead aim, crack shot, Lexicon invited
Off shrooms, I slide in the saloon at noon
Three eyes play the goon as I sweep the room
I rest, mic check, gun check, vest check
Then this honey press the side of my table like vestects
Clear the throat to read the note
Exhale, I free the smoke
Word travels fast round here, that go for broke
Step to the dusty roads and I fear no foes
I gotta go, six shooters and I let shit go

[Nick Fury]
Yo I've had it up to here, I got this much to go
You should be happy my defense is to flow
Because if it were otherwise, you other guys
Might make your next appearance with some bruised under eyes
It is I
Nick Fury, MC in disguise
Give a dap to the sun, me and him, we both rise
It's been hard work like button flies, now it's open
Me and hip hop, we this close to eloping
No joking
Kids are quiet once I have spoken
And when I leave the cipher there's a lot of dreams broken
I'm hoping y'all feel this, but please no groping
Or we may bash elbows like Oakland
Live and outspoken
Man I keep my camp concentrated
Take a step back, admire what we've created

[2Mex]
My hip hop history is the difference between
Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Hunter Hearst Helmsley
The SonGodSuns
My name is 2Mex
I'm looking for Goldberg, ah who's next?
I perfect plex
Preliminary palookas
I turn into 2Mex Superfly Snuka
Much like Rick Flair, master of the figure four
SonGodSuns but six never metaphor
Lacerating leg lock all of your lyrics

Don't leave before the lessons lessen
Believe in your self and not a yeses essence
Stretching the limits of all our dream
While etching your image upon my screen
You love much better in person
Above my head I touch letters in cursive
I drug myself pack the knife
Then I hug my self-back to life
Even though I'm broke as ever
Hope this rope between our spirits never sever

Don't mind if it sounds karaoke
Carry yourself over the finish line
Don't be afraid of the powers that climb over your mental towers
See its ok to be a silly teen
2Mex is everywhere like the legend of Billie jean
We can't afford to be innocent

Throw away the lasers and the k car

Awol One:
Because the meaningless jargon jigsaw word phrase thesaurus battle raps chatter voice-box detox
I’m a microphone vet
Awol is a creature of God
Forever in a day
I throw up on my stupid rhyme book sketches
Because all those words that they spit
Silly immortal
Hip-hop is universal
If you’re poetic
It’s nothingness
Maybe me
It’s me with a lightening scar on my fucking forehead because there’s no music that wouldn’t have a voice
If there was no hip-hop then we wouldn’t have a choice
I believe it like it’s paranormal
It’s barely music
It’s like the ttttaaaa..!!!!!!! gets locked in the domains insane
I'm a positive against negative
My infrared robotic eye can hear from the acne meat factory all the faces of death
Come and see us and see what’s left

(Busdriver)
What is this music called? Technological animal chew-toy
It’ll send a rude boy to etiquette class
It’ll give a flu-shot to a 2Pac impersonator
Even a first grader can see I had a probable cause to shoot everyone at the inaugural ball
And squabble with dogs until they had to hobble on their paws for saying this is barely music
I’m an informative pez dispenser knocking the fez off the senator
So get off my hairy pool stick or get a mule kick in the dead center of your Jerry Lewis smile grin
They fed The Weather clip-out coupons for discounts on the crew song
But I dismount your nude mom
And I made you with various birth defects
You don’t disserve respect
When I bleed blood and write my rhymes on a Chinese rug
And you take the tape
And you put it on high-speed dub
And you share it with your friends
Talking about
“this is what my daddy does
He’s a LA underground G
And like him I want to be an MC." When around me you form elliptical orbits
Your umbilical chord gets clipped and your navel stitched
And I realign your satellite cable dish
And no you can’t record with Daedelus
Get away you wailing bitch
You’ve been taken off the mailing list and given a bag of bagel chips for workers comp
I’m a Leimert (Park) cop and you’re a tiny rapper under protective custody of The Weather

(Radioinactive)
I know that this could be disturbing to some people
Throwing wooden Frisbees across this suburban easel
Louise and Ernesto will wait for escrow
And make some pesto
And hand painted t-shirts
Eat deviled eggs for several days and finish with Danish desserts
You're the famous Eater Bunny
I heard you owe Jesus money
Is it dangerous to bleach your teeth? I’ve paid much more for cheaper seats
When she plays ping pong
She plays for keeps

(2Mex)
Dr. Octopus
Detroit
Demento
Octave all of us deployed essential
Sequence
She can wince
Be convinced
Be pollen
But believe all
And forget outer
It gets louder
Orchids
Flowers
Time-lapse photography
Lying maps on all of me
Co-ordinance
Board immense
Afford the fence
Master lock
Castle rock entertainment
Massive jocks under a payment
Wonder where the winter of days went
Night-school stalker
Fight through the talker
Chameleon
Calm alien bomb through the dawn
Snow flake
Know the date
Not home to take
Survey surveillance
Were they in cadence
We stay cognate
They spray inhalants into the audience
Listening all against God glistening
Mom missing me
I’m missing her

(Circus)
A few years ago
A friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
Well
Imma say the rhyme I’m about to say
The rhyme was the bomb and it went this way
And so the next day came and I heard that someone said that hip-hop was dead
Hmm
Is that the case?
Is hip-hop dead?
Like
No way dude
I can already read your mind
So I know what your thinking
Dog
By the way I got your girl’s head nodding
We keep the party crunkulating with this funky type of abstract rhythms
Hmm
What’s this monster that you’ve created
Hmm
It seems I made a new type of undestructible wack MC creature in my funky-ass laboratory
It was designed to scream and moan just like a torture bitch on the M-I-C
Over a beat that sounds just like a clone off this one
Check it out
I push record and then you extend your arms and you begin to walk just like a zombie in the direction of the mall
And then you pick it up
And then you buy it up
And then you stuff it in to your mouth and then you eat it up
And it tastes good
And then this creepy sound comes seeping out between the cracks of your teeth
Boom-box
Yeah
That too
It spits a dog-eared pitch that emits a strange and bizarre frequency that can hypnotize and convince a barely legal coke whore to get in the trance
And do the forbidden dance
And that’s why you like it so much
Yeah
The jokes on you
The yolks on your face
Cause I tricked you into thinking that this was actually dope
Cool
Stuff
When all along it really wasn't
Ha
Ha
Ha
He
He
He
Y'all are some whomptee
Me so horny
Y'all so crazy
You're stupid for believing that this was really music
Except it really isn't
It's just glopety gloop
It's gloopety goo
It's glopety gunk
Or however you spell that shit[Ivan Ives]
Yeah
Ivan Ives
2Mex
Here we go..

Leggo my ego, the mic stand the easel
Paint words lethal, tough like cheap wool
Snuff film b-roll, fuck til she know
Ivan so ill, I'm illegal
And no, when it comes to flow, we're not equal
I never miss, like God shooting free throws
I won't fall off the bike like Evil Kanievel
And I won't fall off the mic like Beanie Segal
Hip Hop is dead? Nah, I don't think so
I'm Russian Red, not a Pinko
My aims is lofty, I never think low
Cats try to copy, like they was Kinkos
God is hidden, he won't let me see him
But the Devil will shake my hand, so Carpe Diem
I murder without noticin, herder with doubt hopin and
I be a word merger with stout motioning

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!

[2Mex]
2Mex
Los Angeles lyrical lottery
Don't bother me when it comes to dissin common camaraderie
Me and Ivan Ives we straight roll off
Like my homie Daniel and Ivan Koloff
Making these weak motherfuckers just straight hold off
We doing it big, taking your girls coat off
So very often I have the option to coughing on your coffin
You're soft and known for straight sobbing
Bobbin and weaving believe me
These fools with bobby pins in their weave don't believe em
Their happy to be still breathing
Another reason this rap game is so fucking uneven
Heaving these fools out the house like Jazzy Jeff
Stab em in the back cause he was wack as he left
I'm FRESH to death
Even in Moscow
2Mex and Ivan Ives we rock stars and we all style

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!

[Ivan Ives]
We grew up on Hip Hop, you threw up on Hip Hop
Stay away from the mic if your name is Rick Ross
It's kind of on some oh shit, don't front, open, your lungs
Smokin, those blunts
Of course I'm good at Tetris and Chess
I'm Russian, what the fuck you expect?
I been bustin' my ass, now I'm here to collect
Ivan Ives and 2Mex, protect your neck, uh

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!

(Main Verse)
[Xololanxinco]
A message to the village idiots
A Mexican
Descendent, Psycho Realm are the quintessential sac religious
Affiliates, envious doctors
To the snakes and the spiders, my rebels to the fake and the
Biters
When I left the squad
I got one breath left with death threat from God
Ah
With the extraordinary urgency
2Mex is needed for heart culinary surgery
Ha
You got a spot on your retina
I got a penicillin refillable syllable shots full of
Teflon
And I'm hovering like Tiger
Hellion, I'm a love it when I stick it in the belly of the
Beast
With the Psycho Realm
The police, they got our lives all on microfilm
But that's okay
I'll live to see another day
I got tabs full of words that'll wish you away
We're like
Tito Santana
Meets Hercules Hernandez
You're gonna need an antenna just to
Understand this
I'm a militant mil mascaras
I'm diligent when I'm peelin' your casa

[Sick Jacken]
When you step into the scene, expect what will occur
You remember hearin' the drum, the rest is just a blur
Underground sound, it's just a slang in slur
When we sippin' sick juice and illuse
Sick words
Burned by society, left there with asses
Hangin' in the waistline, we Sickside classes
They flash us, the gang signs, the badges, then blast us
Despite the drama
We still bring it to the masses
Rob documentary style (Yeah)
We film the
Realm, what we build to create a song foul
Fans, they go crazy, at shows, make it all worthwhile
If you ain't breaking your neck, fool, you're in denial
The doctors, drums come in, we're too sick to cure
Contaminate our minds, but our hearts remain pure
The plan is secured, soldiers rest assured
Spur the moment, sparks of truth will occur
I got two rap sheets, one with crimes, one with rhymes
Most cycles on the street hurl along the same lines
Psycho cause we're steadily losin' in prison minds
Sometimes, we get a glitch, cop bitch and come find
With full raids
Where fools rage and pigs masquerade
Invade my whole shit, their own laws get disobeyed
Straight from police scene, by releasing the hate on the
Sickest beats, with speak, on streets, we roam crazed

[2Mex]
You wanna live in the palm of the devil
Die as a rebel
Reveal revelations
To the point of a nuclear disaster, we're factored
To the rapture, captured by the columnists
Searchin' for significance, driftin' towards a bias preference
Even as an old mayne
There's no freedom
On the other side of the gate
This world is a prison
Measurin' your whereabouts, suffocatin'
Heredity animate me, social realism
From the pyramid to the paradox
Where all three-strike offenders
Rendered as a lifeline
Get snorted as a cokeline {*sniff*}
How high will you get
Before I have to
Blow that ass up just like Steven Nicks
Lying in a hospital, sick
I'm lyin' to
Escape this hazardous trick
Medical America
By lethal injection
There's rooms that react to this in selves
It's like where dreams to a toxin polin and
Crawlin' in through the layers of an ocean
The modern count of justice
Zero
Be hear, the poison begins within our earlobes
This, age
Of blashemy
Sent an Aztec team on the street corner
While Michigan gets blast at me

[2Mex]
We've got bigger problems[Hook - 2X]
2Mex falcon gentle
The outcome is mental
Inner visions of anarchism essential
From inside the mouth of south central
Which side of your soul should I attend to?

[Verse 1]
Die in a rush never painted with a (?) brush
Just like you fearing god was my high school crush
Misunderstood up at the prom
Misunderstood up under a bomb
Still they deliver the silver sonnets
Shiver and quiver if you really were ever honest
Never was never really upon us
Forever was cleverly thrust upon us
Gray patients I stay ancient
Decayed saint ships
A vapor ray trips in the middle of arcade flips
In a way its our art our came well equipped
I'm buying red don't die on your bed know that I am what's said
Code of Zion misled
For I am stormberg
Now conformist warm words
Torn disturbed the laughing sunrise
Collapsing lung size
Grasping rasping tongue tied
Robots can't feel it in here
Boy copy imperial theater

[Hook - 2X]

[Verse 2]
Lunar solburn balloon into the auburn
Crimson maroon the edge is all burned
Over done orange
Brothers and sisters over the sun
We will find the courage
To reconnect with the umbilical
To see corrected stand at the pinnacle
If you can memorize your own pin code
Then you can energize your within soul
My words of hope they tour the scope
Of what you think is hardcore dope
The assorted coats
Touchable figure heads
Im on the payroll of un touchable bigger heads
Im 3 secrets
From losing my life but maybe saving yours today
My rights and wrongs are expandable
Tonight's my songs are what I'm sending you

[Hook]2mex produced by longevity
So heavenly
So long heavy d
The over weight lover is in the apartment
I hover over the hate of others
I don't know where their hearts went
Our hearts echo
Art deco
You tall gecko fall roman I saw (????)
Old mens suffer neck abrasions
I told them
I was tougher than neck anisa (?)
Heckle a nation
Like Fidel from seditious
I'm living America with infidels and their riches
Witches
A wizard or a witches
Even if their just lizards their still bitches
Mind switches
From topic to topic
Nine stitches from the optic
Dropkick redefines and blind follow me friend's laughter
Be kind to find that all of this ends after
You see that you're not the master
In the seas pop the master
And that's why the water is filled with salt
And that's why the slaughtering and the killing must halt
Ahh call up and tell a clairvoyant
Your all up in hell I'm so there that it's annoying
I'm toying with you in my poem with heavy letters
I'm showing you how to be your own Che araveug
With out a beret my

I walk through the streets of Havana
And I'm a let

Hey what's up yo this is Alex
Hey hey thank you for the email
Uh you got the flyer already then?
Ok you know cool cool good good

Only got one night in town
Baby doll are you down

[Verse 1: 2Mex]
Hey yo thank you
For coming out to the sound check
I haven't even started running around yet
We just got here not to long ago
Is it me or did your hair get longer? No?
Why do you still think we met on the legends tour
I know I met you before that I'm just not sure
I think I met you on the flow and tell
I think we just said what's up to each other we didn't know each other
That well
Anyway
Why don't you take me away for part of the day
I'm down if you roll a j
Yo just take me away from this tour van
I'd love to walk around the city holding your hand
So is it all right if I stay with you so
I can pocket the money the promoter gave me for the hotel
Cool you're the best
No ones gonna take that away from you yes yes
So what up now I heard you have a man now
Hey that's cool whatever
I understand how you get lonely yo
Busdriver told that on the other tour you came to his show with some homie
Hey that not your man no more?
That not my business what happens
I'm just letting you know I know that it happened
Hey I know your in the mix
Don't front it sucks we only get to kick it once
Every 6 months
Lets not talk about that tonight
Shoot me back to the venue cuz I got to go rock the mic
Yo really though
I got to get to work
But its so cute you came to my show wearing my shirt
No I don't think that your stalking me its funny
How you chased away the only other girl that wanted to talk to me
But for real though its cool
All the love an affection your giving me is cool
Thank you
For all the drawing pictures and letters
Thank you for letting me kick it with you tonight whatever
Yeah I know you wanna talk about that song
I haven't thought about it in so long
I don't know if you like me or just my music
I like looking in to your eyes just like a muse
Its an even trade
Believe me if I could I would have stayed in a room we haven't made in the shade

[Awol One]
You got one night in town break out
Of the ground baby doll are you down
Only got one night in town
Baby doll are you downStrong winds push away the debris
Another long day decides what to be
Leaves on the trees are the instruments
Believe what you see only in increments
My equals think that I am blind
I find kind people sink into sublime
Power lines clever designs
Flowers vines
Only severed minds say never mind
I'm not nirvana
I just got the words you wanna pour on your medulla oblongata
I have now stood on four continents
I'm searching for more vowels and consonants
Carvings and hieroglyphics
Harboring words is my world specific
From simple characters
To symbols and caricatures
Round cylinders that don't sound similar
Indiana Jones Indian in a zone
Indigenous and never alone
I have decoded it and now I got it
I know that my life is not encoded or robotic
I know the moon is my grandmother
Why am I not in a mood to stand under?
I'm controlled by the kilowatts
I've been sold to the nano bots
Private to general electric
Get their orders at intervals accepted
Don't die in the artificial light
Go out side your hearts the issues fightPeople You Know
[Verse 1: Pawz One]
Being far beyond driven has driven me far beyond
Anything that I envisioned, I got my tickets, I'm gone
Now it's on, im drawn to the music Pros and the cons
Landing at JFK and haters standing on the lawn
Drinking the same 40oz, same stories all the time
He can rap, but he's too busy, He's living a life of crime
Never held his own, he's Al Capone inside his own mind
Paranoid and bugging Thinks they listen on his phone line
Focus on my own grind, the feeling is good
It's a shame to come back and see him still in the hood
See, some homies went to college, others signed up for the navy
And that girl that had potential, you can find her with a baby
Kid's daddy is missing, A loser with no ambition
Seems like time's frozen, He's stuck in the same position
And You can catch him tweaking in his house with a gun
And he ain't left the block since 2001

[Verse 2: Pawz One]
See, a dude I used to know, He's got 45 kids
Struggled to handle biz, He's barely filling his fridge
Catch him at the liquor store trying to bum a cig
But if you hear him tell it, he's always doing it big
Save it for the bitches you're trying to run game on
His baby mom's a chick they used to all run a train on
Gonorrhea Flame on, Burning to take a piss
Got her name on his neck, tatted next to her lips
Ain't that a trip? Years go by, letting him slip
Still cruising by the high school to check out the chicks
The homie's 26, still using the dirty tricks
In his girl's car, Radio up, bumping the system
Wait for the bell to ring to find himself a victim
Girls, don't be distracted by the image and the looks
It's harder to carry babies than it is to carry books

[Verse 3: 2Mex]
Up in Mid-City, California, 1981
Sycamore Avenue, right off La Brea and Washington
You see, it wasn't that fun
Watching people smoke crack from the barrel of a gun
I seen this one dude do someone foul
Someone killed him and cut off his dick and straight left it in his mouth
I know that shit sound wild, and for the
Next 10 years I had to walk by the house
I used to get lectured everyday by the neighborhood
Wino, He ended up disappearing or dying far as
I know, My neighbor used to smoke rocks
And he used to try to break in my car a whole lot
One time, he broke into my ride and ended up
Getting me for my Blaupunkt, I thought I locked the door. but I must've forgot one
And I'm so motherfucking dumb, yo
But that's the norm where I come from
I was a church kid, which means I would be
Outside of mass selling Mexican sweet breads, like a merch kid
And yo, I most definitely wasn't the worst kid
But people talked about my parents being poor like we weren't
Worth shit, That's why I had to prove them wrong, though
That's why I had to do more with my self then attend Rio Hondo
And straight smoking on this chrondo
Over 20 years of music and now its on thoughYeah!
2Mex clusive
Yeah
And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

[Verse 1]
My name is 2Mex I'm not afraid of the cops I
Just live, check to check and I stay hip-hop
I got a brand new CD that I know you don't got
I got my own fat section at the mom and pops
And I'm the - reason that your little brother's not a gangster
I'd like to take a little bit of time to just thank you
For buying imitations to weak toys
You've spawned a new nation of b-boys
The bling bling stuff was a mirage
I got your sister doing headspins in the garage
And you can pass the XO pass the Hennessy
Pass me the X-Clan and Public Enemy
The straight best from the underground West
You should buy a kid a book and not a bulletproof
Vest so if you're wondering why you should even try
+All Eyez+ are on me but I'm not +Ready to Die+

[Hook]
So when you feel down like you don't belong
And you actually care about lyrics in a song
I got this brand new drug
And it's the bomb
Its called run back home and hug your mom

And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

[Verse 2]
My name is 2Mex and I'm proud to be brown
In L.A. I got a ghetto pass I'm allowed to be down
I'm a walk into your town like a bum or a clown
As soon as I open my mouth you hear the lyrics sound
I'm a miracle elephant it' s not a miracle (?)
West coast underground hip-hop is relevant
So go ahead and dissolve in the illusion
I know this song won' t solve the resolution
You might catch me in an Escalade
But I don't make hip-hop to have sex and get paid

[Hook]

And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania

And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania

And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride"
So I
Hop inside

[Verse One] [Murs]:
She said she never did it before
So we did it before
She changed her mind, because she seemed unsure
Pure
Ecstasy I gave her my legacy
Woke up the next mornin', and you know what she said to me?
"We only fuck. You don't really love me
We never make love and that makes me feel ugly
You push and you shove me, you pull my hair
Grab me around the throat then you choke me and stare."
You stare at me like you hate me, so do you?
That look in your eyes seems like I never knew you
Like every other week I receive the same speech
Cause she's feelin' guilty cause she really a freak
So when she's off to work, I'm makin' somethin' to eat
I sneak and put rose petals all over the sheets
Turn on some slow jams and we have simple sex
And the very next night we back to the triple X

[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride"
So I
Hop inside

[Bridge]:
She puts her hands in the air
Like she's reachin' for clouds
But she won't sit down, cause she's screamin' so loud

[Verse Two] [2Mex]:
She's so hard to stay away from
My friends always say I'm dumb and that she's dangerous
But I'm so insane I trust my lust for her
Other girls are a lackluster blur
She wack, but I always end up thrustin' her
Against the wall
Fuckin' her should be against the law
The contradictions in her are the contradictions of us all
With that ADHD, I'm like, "Baby it's me
Can I ABC/see you out of that baby tee?"
There's no maybe G, she's fuckin' crazy
And that's the fuckin' trick, that we be fuckin' crazy
I'm losin' it
I'm think she's startin' to phase me
Every time I leave her she looks at me like, "Save me."

[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride", so I
Hop inside

[Bridge]:
She puts her hands in the air
Like she's reachin' for clouds
But she won't sit down, cause she's screamin' so loud

[Verse Three] [Murs]:
She's got split personalities, she ruined my life
It's like I wifed one chick and got two for the price
I really wanna leave her but I thought about it like
If I wanna break up, then I gotta call her twice

[2Mex]:
She's bi-polar, bi-sexual and buy's me issues of my favorite comics
When my sinks dirty she buys me Comet
Whatever I need, homie, she's on it
A woman like this, is rarely seen like Hailey's Comet
But then she changes up, just like a Coin Star
Tell me we're not goin' far like I don't even know who you are
And this ain't workin' right
When last night she complimented me of how I was workin' it right
Damn Sybil
Always givin' me mixed signals
Do you wanna be single or do you wanna be under my wing
Go away
If you're really going to stay
Stop tellin' me you love me and don't in the same day

[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride", so I
Hop inside
