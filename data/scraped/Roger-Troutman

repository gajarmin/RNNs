In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild West
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoons
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-i-aye

[Hook]

[Bridge: Roger Troutman]
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing, but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grands
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside
So you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down
Give me love!

[Hook]

[Ad-Libs]

[2Pac]
Throw it up ya'll, throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this West Side[Verse 1: H-Town & Roger Troutman]
[H]It's a thin line, it's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I'm just getting in, I knock on the door
A voice sweet and low says, who is it?
She opens up the door and lets me in
Never do she once say, sir, where have you been?
No, she says, are you hungry?
Are you hungry, honey?
[R]Did you eat yet?
[H&R]Let me hang up your coat, your coat, your coat
[H]And the woman tells me, pass me your hat too
All the time she smiles, never raises her voice
It's 5 o'clock in the morning

[Hook: H-Town]
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

[Verse 2: H-Town]
The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That'll really really hurt you one day

Here I am laying in the hospital
Bandaged from feet to head
Ya see I'm in the state of shock baby
Just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman could do something like this to me
I didn't think she had the nerve, so here I am
I guess action speaks louder than words

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shirley Murdock]
The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That could hurt you one day

[Hook]

[Bridge: H-Town & Roger Troutman]
[H]It's a thin line (It's a thin line)
Between love and hate (You know it is)
It's a thin line
[R]Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line
[H]It's a thin line (It's a thin line)
Between love and hate (You know it is)
It's a thin line
[R]Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line
[H]It's a thin line
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
[R]Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin lineDown for yours if you're down for mine
Ooooooo....
Nastyboy Klick, I would die for you
Down for yours if you're down for mine
Ooooooo....
Nastyboy Klick, are you down for your dj?
Down for yourz if you're down for mine

I'll be that man dropping skill
Give your body chills
Let me wine and dine you boo
No doubt that I'll be good to you
I like a girl that always gots my back
Whenever I need her she'll be standing with a mac
If you down to represent
And put your trust in me
Ain't scared of no guns
And let me run the street
Let me do what I gotta do
And show you I'm fine, love you blind
It's just that hook-ups take time
Ain't gotta have ends or a place to live
Smoking fat phillys
I'm still down wit you kid
So if you want it, come and get it, don't take too long
Cause in the valley of AZ
Finding fly females ain't hard
So come and take a ride
And if you swing to this bounce
Room 6-0-duece
That's what I'm all about
Fulfill your fantasies
And all of your desires
Lay back, pop the top up
And let me take you higher

[Chorus]
Loving you this way, I'll never lead you astray
I knew you were my D.O.G. when you put your trust in me
Down for yours if your down for mine (put your trust in me)
I'm down for yours, if your down with my flow, keep it going
I'm always down for my G
Down for yours if you're down for mine

Now all I need is a shorty with a mac like that
Victoria Secret, champagne, and bubble baths
Let the magic man rub you down like a magic lamp
And I'm getting 3 wishes
I likes that
Cause ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Abouts to giving you lovin like this Duke of Earl, uhh
Feel the lovin that I gots for you
Moet, candy, flowers and some diamonds too
Just to let you know how I feel for you
I dedicate my life and my soul to you
So now that you've been thinking of a man for your life
I promise if I get it
I'm a treat you right
Never playa hate
And always down to sex me
And every time I see you
Giving much respect to me
I'll be down for yours
If your down for mine
Cause a love like ours
Ain't easy to find

[Chorus]

What you want Goldilocks
Money can't buy
Butterscotch made divine
Styles like Calvin Klein
Design for the masses
No style you sport clashes
Hazardous to the health of all men
Beauty descends, dividends, lust remains
Heavenly same my intent ignites flames
Exclaim, never complain
To give you affection
If being right's so wrong
You never need correction
Most definitely you get the best of me at times
If lovins what I need
You supply all kinds
I see your brown eyes scheming from across the room
Checking me out but you look away....
No reason to gaze
Look where the game
Competitions the same
Too many heinas lookin good
For me and you to keep playin
So what it be
I'm down for whatever you need
Just me and you
Hand in hand
Roaming through ecstasy

[Chorus]

Down for yours, down for mine, OoOoOo....
Down for yours if you're down for mine
More bounce for my G's
You're my computer love
More bounce G's
Down for yours if you're down for mine
Down for yours if you're down for mine
I want to be your G, baby, I want to be your G
Yes I do

Jesus fellas[Intro: Yella talking]
Yo, this is Yella
As we wine down to the final song
I wanted to make this one to remember my lil' nigga E
I know he wanted this track on his record
Though he was takin' from us too god damn soon
So I finished for him, peace nigga

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
We did a song "Fuck Tha Police", you know
And everybody been hearin' fuck sayin'
Fuck tha police for years and years and years
And finally it took a motherfucker to video tape
A nigga gettin' the shit beat out of him
For everybody else to say fuck tha police
And we did fuck tha police, people put us down
And sayed we were ahead of our time, you know it
Took the video, you know, ya shot by accident
To tell the truth and open the world's eyes
Yes, we do have a serious problem in L.A
And other citys true retaliate happens all the time
People tryin' to change things for years but I don't
Think anything is gonna help the problem is to deep
N.W.A. is just bein' brutally honest

City of Compton (x2)
City of, city of Compton, baby, baby

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
They swearin' on cable TV it ain't teachin'
Nobody nothin' new cause little kids grow up
You know one, two years old hearin' there mother
Sayin' fuck this, you little son of bitch I beat
The shit out of you and all this shit and you know
They pick up from all the shit and you know so they
Learn shit, you know, it's not gonna be teachin'
Motherfuckers nothin' new cause I got some new words
For your ass
We don't tell you to go out and gang bang
We tell you ya know and our songs is as you
Know if you could go out stealin' and killin'
And beatin' up people all day but that person
Ends up dead or in jail sometimes he gets away
You know and we don't have no rags no red no blue
Rags and tellin' we gonna go out and creep or go
Out and do that other thing or whateva it is
You know we ain't tell you to be joinin' no gang

Like Tag Team, back again
Here we go, with a flow, get dealt with quick
Now Joe I know my rap style pro
Let em know, with the quickness, y'all need to witness
Step to the side, y'all mind y'all business
Exercise, like physical fitness
Ride through, I glide through
Bass pump to the trunks inside you
We move it quickly, rap styles swift B
Cadillac rollin, neck full of gold and
Crafty, nasty, can't put it past me
Step with skills, better call your family
Turn adverse worse, climb in the first verse
Move when I back it up, attack and I smack it up
Girls connectin it, Ultra legend and
Why y'all rhymes soft, fruity affectionate
I keep steppin and, boost my rep again
Speed up, go slow, you got the next again
Do the La Bamba, turn to Mexican
Swift to shift up, change the pitch up
DJ mix ups, your face get fixed up
Nuts get licked up, quickly, strictly

Chorus: repeat 2X

I'm warnin, watch yo' backpack mack
Yo' crack lack facts I tax yo' ass
So fast you press up mess up step up
Through this when I do this
I'm the smoothest when I groove this speedy
Turn back yo, don't try to be greedy
Houston, Tex, out of New York City
Girls get pretty, yo look at them titties
Astrofunk'n revolve in the trunk and
Party's live, might turn into somethin
Let them know though, I'm still pro though
Companies what, wanna sign me solo
Squeeze your knee, let your man try to read
Ease the bleed, shut up animal feed
Step or ski, let you know what it be G
Cruiser shades, at the bar can't see me
Grizzly Adams, grab em, pat em
Suckers don't know, how bad I'm madam
Turn and flex and servin necks and
Any anorexin fools wanna flex in
Y'all won't know when I pull up in a Lex and
MasterCards, with certified checks and
Bank bills, fly rims in the hills
Y'all get cups, get more refills

Chorus

[Kool Keith]
Check your watch, now watch me partner
Start to welcome back kids like Kotter
Move your fans, while I rock a little harder
Hoes and foes, hit em all with blows
Watch girls work it, movin unopposed
Hip to flip, throw the thing to they lip
When I dress, yes, put em all to the test
Rock a suede vest, pink jewels on my chest
Rappin, clappin, fingers start snappin
Watch how you actin, I'm rubbin on the back
And MC's is slack and your groups sound wack
Where'd you turn B? Nobody burn me
Style get complex, why you concerned B?
I'm your chalkboard, now you can learn me
Round and round and big bass soundin
Down South Hustler, big bass poundin
East West, top down to the bone
Motorollin' on my cellular phone
Change the tone, get up out my zone
Movin next to you, rhyme will flex to you
Stop I'm overdue, jumpin over you
Status go, to the baddest bro

California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild West
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoons
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-i-aye

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing, but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grands
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside
So you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down
Give me love!

It's too intense
I tried I tried I tried I tried to tell you how I feel
But I get mixed up (so mixed up)

Like Tag Team, back again
Here we go, with a flow, get dealt with quick
Now Joe I know my rap style pro
Let em know, with the quickness, y'all need to witness
Step to the side, y'all mind y'all business
Exercise, like physical fitness
Ride through, I glide through
Bass pump to the trunks inside you
We move it quickly, rap styles swift B
Cadillac rollin, neck full of gold and
Crafty, nasty, can't put it past me
Step with skills, better call your family
Turn adverse worse, climb in the first verse
Move when I back it up, attack and I smack it up
Girls connectin it, Ultra legend and
Why y'all rhymes soft, fruity affectionate
I keep steppin and, boost my rep again
Speed up, go slow, you got the next again
Do the La Bamba, turn to Mexican
Swift to shift up, change the pitch up
DJ mix ups, your face get fixed up
Nuts get licked up, quickly, strictly

Chorus: repeat 2X

I'm warnin, watch yo' backpack mack
Yo' crack lack facts I tax yo' ass
So fast you press up mess up step up
Through this when I do this
I'm the smoothest when I groove this speedy
Turn back yo, don't try to be greedy
Houston, Tex, out of New York City
Girls get pretty, yo look at them titties
Astrofunk'n revolve in the trunk and
Party's live, might turn into somethin
Let them know though, I'm still pro though
Companies what, wanna sign me solo
Squeeze your knee, let your man try to read
Ease the bleed, shut up animal feed
Step or ski, let you know what it be G
Cruiser shades, at the bar can't see me
Grizzly Adams, grab em, pat em
Suckers don't know, how bad I'm madam
Turn and flex and servin necks and
Any anorexin fools wanna flex in
Y'all won't know when I pull up in a Lex and
MasterCards, with certified checks and
Bank bills, fly rims in the hills
Y'all get cups, get more refills

Chorus

[Kool Keith]
Check your watch, now watch me partner
Start to welcome back kids like Kotter
Move your fans, while I rock a little harder
Hoes and foes, hit em all with blows
Watch girls work it, movin unopposed
Hip to flip, throw the thing to they lip
When I dress, yes, put em all to the test
Rock a suede vest, pink jewels on my chest
Rappin, clappin, fingers start snappin
Watch how you actin, I'm rubbin on the back
And MC's is slack and your groups sound wack
Where'd you turn B? Nobody burn me
Style get complex, why you concerned B?
I'm your chalkboard, now you can learn me
Round and round and big bass soundin
Down South Hustler, big bass poundin
East West, top down to the bone
Motorollin' on my cellular phone
Change the tone, get up out my zone
Movin next to you, rhyme will flex to you
Stop I'm overdue, jumpin over you
Status go, to the baddest bro

Uh, it's really get scandalous (Scandalous)
Ooh, scandalous (Scandalous)
Uh, scandalous (Scandalous)

[E-40]
Yeah, don't allow no speaks
We play for keeps among these darkened streets
No peace, half of them fools I went to school with are deceased
Sad, especially when your rag don't come from much
I'm doin' bad, but they call me playboy
Partner came through in the clutch, reached out and touched
And I want the Chips Ahoy without the milk and honey
I ain't no punkish fool, steady missin' money
Steady missin' fetti, Eddie steady missin' scrill
I'm tryin' to make enough allowance to pay my water bill

[D-Shot]
Growin' up wasn't that cool to me
I didn't have that many friends just enemies
Until I quit school and started slangin' dope
Came up and wanted a lil' mo'
Mo' mail, clientele yo that sells
Humongous clout, tryin' hard not to fail
Boss ballin' feelin' my way this mo' each day
Out smartin fools tryin' to have it my way

[Suga-T]
Well, how can a cutie come so so tight
Everybody and they mama got a gat so don't nobody be wantin' to fight
Haters be out there bad tryin' to impress their foes
Pimps turn em' out and then they grow up to be sad-a-pus
Gotta keep a child because I'm tryin to get paid
Yeah, gotta shake these city slickers outta my way
But now mother's day I didn't like a hold on, amen
Stay strong, through it all, do it all
Cause folks is straight scandalous

[Hook]
Scandalous, shit is gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, it's really gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous yeah
Scandalous, it's really gettin' scandalous yeah

[B-Legit]
I'm off in this game, runnin' thangs tryin to get it
I do what I do but I'm true when I spit it
Talk about the time when the grind did me bad
Broke in my pad, took everything I had
Left me with the fo' maybe I can trade her in
Rent's due and all I got is a fen
Knots in my stomach can't understand this
Fools in the town becomin' scandalous

[E-40]
I know some things that'll stun ya, make ya wonder
I seen the scandalous use their children social security number
I seen fiends make pipes outta ink pens
Commit incest throw they body at they own kids
Playas become haters, if they ain't doin' it now they doin' it later
Oh you ain't heard man this here's startin' to be contagious
Can't be sittin' in the cabinet collectin' dust
Plus, man this life is so scandalous

[Hook]
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous
Scandalous, really gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous

[D-Shot]
I remember sittin' in the pen
On the pool table hopin' that I win
Ten packs of some noodles, coffee, and some cigarettes
Tryin' to get penitentiary rich
It seems fools don't wanna pay
My source of income depends on day to day
Nobody on the streets cares for me
No packages or no messages

[B-Legit]
Scandocious, keep my focus would ya feel me
Got me thinkin' people close to me tryin to kill me
That's why I ride with this hill side mean mug
Bust ueys and only smoke with the lueys
The other day they was plottin' on my homie Dre
Tried to slip him a mickey in his Bombay
But now we knowin' not to fall for the oakey-doakey
Brings his own bottle and his smokes

[Suga-T]
I was left in the dark scene had to run
Did what I had to do, kept my game tight and never wonderin'
Credit card scandals, boostin' falsified checks
Takin chances, scandalous

[Suga-T impersonating Shirley Murdock]
You know times are so scandalous
What should we do, just keep on movin'
Close your eyes, have that flow
Could it be your face I see up in these scandalous dreams

[Hook to fade][Intro: Roger Troutman]
Spice 1
Too Short, yup
Said I'm a real playa, yeah
Real playa
Playa
Playa
Playa

[Verse 1: Too Short]
Whoever try to buy a new Benz, spend money on your friends
Order up some shit with a pocket full of ends
Ain't no sympathy for suckers, bitch, I'm a hustler
For the last 12 years I could never get enough of
That cash, I keep it in my jeans, bitch
Have you ever seen it? A big pile of green shit?
When I spend it, bitch, I'm the man
I do what I want, suckers do what they can
That's why I moved to the A, straight from the Bay
I'm still mackin' bitches everyday, anyway
And if you don't like it, I don't give a fuck
I'mma still let my top down and turn this shit up
Nothin' half on my business, keep gettin' paid
If niggas stick together, maybe we'll live to see the day
When everybody keep ballin' like me and my folks
Let these gold-diggin' bitches count my spokes
Short Dog in the house

[Hook: Roger Troutman]
Real playaz do what they want to
Suckas do what they can
Real playaz do what they want to
No time for strugglin'
Real playaz do what they want to
Suckas do what they can
Real playaz do what they want to
Real thugs gon' hustlin'

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
Hop in the Ranger Rover, mob, thrustin' this out my car
Shit better be hard, ghetto celebrity star
Smoke 'dro out of jelly jars
Boss to be fraud, catch me at the telly with broads
Havin' ménage à trois, X-ed out on the Celly with Todd
"Short Dog, what's up?" He told me Roger Troutman passed
I hollered, my shit about to crash
Copped a block of hash, an ounce of grass
Damn! Poppin' Crystal, poured me a glass
Then poured the whole rest of the bottle out on the flow for yo' ass
This's for my nigga Roger, the godfather of futuristic funk
Here's the ganja, get it crunk
Twist the skunk, hit it once
And keep that shit movin' and
Thug niggas do what they want to, and busta niggas do what you're doin'
I went from rags to riches, bagged bitches, Jags and 6's
To droppin' a solo album that's sellin' more than the last shit did
I got the streets and ave's addicted
Cash it: Swiss accounts, drunk as fuck in the stretch narrow strippers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
I've come from More Bounce To The Ounce to Short Dog and Roger Troutman
Yukmouth, we thugged out for the money and all the power
Real niggas do what they want to, suckers do what the fuck they can
Self-ma-made-mu-muthafuckin-man
Poppin' my collar, li-livin'; the hustler's dream
Ballers fiend for cream, pockets bust out the seams
Franklin and Grant is my dogs, I die for em
(Die for em) C-cry, lie, ride for em (ride for em)
Nigga, I know You Heard It Through the Grapevine
I was out here doin' it way too live
Doin' way too much, I'm tryin' to touch 40 million bucks
And flip a jet with some beaters, about 14
Flop through your hood, bumpin' this shit, smokin' sticky green
Thugs be hustlin', muggin' and puttin' muscle in
No time for strugglin, keep your mind on bubblin'
You can't see me through websites, but I still got Computer Love
For my nigga Roger Troutman, cause he was ridin' with real thugs
Nigga

Yeeah, throw it up throw it up, (what what?)
Eastside (what what?), Dogg Pound, what what what what? (what?)
Yeeah, Snoop Dogg up in there, what up, what up? yeeah... D.P.G

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Dogg from the "Beach" Eastside on mine
I'm striking through the hood
While I'm slanging my goods
I'm hollaring at my folks (what up?), rolling up some dope
4-Tay from the Bay they say we West Coast folks, you know (you know)
We can't be nothing but that (but that)
And when you bust we bust right back
No play, 4-Tay tell them about the Dogg
I dip to the Bay then get the money y'all
I catch a plane with the gang, purple on my brain
That nigga, that nigga done done it again
Still my nigga, for real my nigga
D.P.G.C. it's a big deal my nigga
Wherever we go we represent the turf until it hurt
Long Beach niggas will rush you to the dirt (nigga)
Eastsidaz, real riders
Throw it up like you know it up, throw it up

[Hook (1): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)
Throw it up, yeah (oooh ooooooh oooh, throw it up!)
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
All the homies on the Eastside where the G's ride
Do your thug thing homie, throw it up (throw it up, oooh ooooooh oooh)
All the homies on the West Side, yeah (throw it up!)
All the homies on the West Side (throw it up!) throw it up throw it up
Throw it up throw it up, do your thug thing

[Verse 2: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Pressure bust pipes, we bust raps
Niggas don't want funk cause we bust caps
Get off in the zone then I'm in and blaze up
You ain't about your cheese I'd advise you to raise up
Cowards can't kick it cause the game don't mix right
That's like bringing a butter knife to a gun fight
I kick it with the sickest from the Bay to L.A
We get the figures, squeeze them triggers if you stepping our way
4-Tay from the Sco (San Francisco) with Snoop D-O double
Players, gangsters, hustlers, you motherfuckers in trouble
Critically acclaimed, this men is his nemesis, ain't no end to this
My mind playing tricks on me - I'm seeing images
Fish tailing, inhaling, bailing, positive suspension
Don't hate on a player cause I'm staying on a mission
Nigga, get yours hit the billboards and bust
For Roger Troutman, we gone give it up, we gone throw it up

[Hook (2): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)
Throw it up, yeah (oooh ooooooh oooh, throw it up!)
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
All the homies on the Eastside where the G's ride
Do your thug thing homie, throw it up (throw it up, oooh ooooooh oooh)
All the homies on the West Side, yeah (throw it up!)
All the homies on the West Side (throw it up!) throw it up throw it up
Throw it up throw it up, do your thug thing
Throw it up, all my homies on the South Side yeah, get live get live
Throw it up throw it up, throw it up
All my homies on the North, throw it up throw it up
Yeah just throw it up, throw it up throw it up throw it up
(Throw it up throw it up throw it up...)

[Verse 3: Tray Deee]
I keep it sparking, heat is barking, daylight to darkness
Known for doing wrong, getting ours regardless
We come up out the ghetto, never settle for chump change
We out there running things doing our thug thing
Game recognize and I been checking mine
Gang of suckers try, get them lame second tries
We G'd up, C'd up sipping, blazing weed up
Haters steady playing but ain't ready yet to see us
We bust big caps, restless with your chit-chat
Player, where your chips at?, broke?, you better fix that
If you ain't a hustler you must of been a buster
It's all about who falling out the game and who running
Done it all like a hog calling the dogs
Never sleep, never slip and not often I pause
Tray Deee, way G, known to flow and blow it up
And make everybody in the party throw it up

[Hook (2): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)

[Outro: Tray Deee]
Rest in peace Roger Troutman, this for you homie
All y'all throw it up[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I gets, mo' trips than a little bit
I smoked, mo' dips than a little bit
I'm not that regular, when stepping I can't wait 'till I can fly
Away from my competitor, yeah, Santana can die
My psychosis hopeless, focus, notice
My metamorphosis, folks is broke and jokeless
Picture me in a syringe inserted in an overexerted felon
Antidote having 'em runnin' eternally across the helland
Dwamn, losin' my sanity livin' up in Les Miserables
Fuck bitter broads, this shit is gonna have us stacking if there is a God
I'mma take the X away from generation, place it at the end of S.E
For the duration
Upon the level
Tell the devil to what
Skip a human
I'mma tell him, "Behold pale horses like us"
Shame on a nigga when he feelin'
Hella down for a ninety-nine killin'
Ain't giving a
Fuck I'm putting Nair
In your leave in hair conditioner
Now you Hari Krishna
To my listeners: In this rhyme you will find
Psychotic scriptures saying it's somethin' disrupting my mind

[Hook]
Tech N9ne your mind is fine
There's just not anyone like you
The whole wide world don't matter no
They can't flow like you
I must make you understand

My thoughts are twisted (So twisted)
My thoughts are twisted (So twisted)
My thoughts are twisted (So twisted)
But I get mixed up (So twisted)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
A, I'm lifted, B, I'm twisted
C, I'm sick and sadistic, A, B and C
Something's I do I just can't stand
Up in my bathroom I sex six women
Mentally, just me and me
Me and my faithful right hand man
Tie up a Muslim
And shoot him with liquid pork
On Ramadan
With force
I'll make a Christian
Read their kids
The necronomicon
On Christmas
Don't trip on this lyrical syphilis
I flip this
So the yonks will catch vapors
Like mentho-lyptus
I'll feed a dominatrix patient
Pain pills
Give Wu haters permanent
Fang grills
Trick the artist formerly known and give him the same slave deal
I'll lift a couple of
Dr. Dre's reels
Sell em' to Snoop
And No Limit Soldiers
Just so I can see
How paid feels
Hazy Shade
Of decayed
Hookers with grave shields
Where AIDS fills
The carcass
Bet a milli on it Tecca N9na be the darkest
Heartless, I spark from the gut
So what the fuck?
I'm trying to contain the insane, but what?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Welcome to my Asylum, it's hectic, they call me dyslexic
Rogue infested
More vicious than Cujo
Fraudulent tested
The punks arrested
Got the neck slit
Exit
I'm twisted
I know Hollywood backwards says "doowylloh"
Force feed me a
Sumo
For about nine weeks
Playing Club
Nuevo
Till he's blue
Though
Then stuff him in the front seat of a
Yugo
Body filled with beef and toaster
Strudel
Let up the break
And watch him race
To the intersection
Now he's through
Though
Yastuvo
I slide with a gang
Of twisted individuals
Somebody better be
Looking for the criminal tendencies
Never will they get us in the penitentiaries, killa
Millimeter N9ne rips vinyl, I know
Mix flow like Korean Albino, Wino
Once breeded an elephant
With a rhino
Called it the hell if I know
Throw Chuck Manson
Off in a pit
Of militant Jews
Banging hella opera
The real meaning of helter skelter is when they skin that forehead swastika
Am I twisted? Am I twisted?
I'm twisted, better keep your distance
Mama gotta call the psychiatrics for mental assistance

[Hook][Verse 1: Scarface]
Its on and once again I come to you wit rough shit
Game to bust shit when mutha fuckers wanna fuck wit
The mastermind will bring it once I seen it in light
Awaken by the sounds of niggas screamin' at night
Cover your eyes I leave you face to face with your maker
The time taker intend your mind so now I break ya
No runnin' from it you should've ran before I done it
Cause now I got this loaded twelve gage against your stomach
You scarred for life and your whole high life's invited
Burned alive its all for real so tonight I ignite
And leave you all face down to die
With no will to live I can see the fear in your eyes
No warning surprise nigga I come for taking
Your soul for satan watching' every move that your making
Your sure mistaken if you a ho before I turn out
Walking away I'll heat you up and leave you burnt out-nigga
I'm hard to kill cause I refuse to die
And can't no man born of woman alive kill me
I'm Untouchable

[Hook: Roger Troutman]
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
(I'm untouchable)
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
(I'm unfuckable)
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
Un-touch a-ble out here baby

[Verse 2: Scarface]
It's danger I'm standin' in the footsteps of danger
Wit a loaded Mac 11 stripped wit rips in the chamber
The anger I aim the barrel of the hanger
Deep into the mind of this mutha fuckin stranger
I change ya outlook on living and I leave ya
Frozen starin' into space shakin' seizuring
I told ya the southside niggas roll deep
I showed ya the northside niggas don't sleep
Ya beat I'm coming down shootin up your section
You are now witnessing the gangster shit pure perfection
I'm old school O.G. niggas know me
From slanging' eightballs uncooked to moving whole keys
Now why these niggas wanna test my skills
I'm a killa and I chastise steel
To mix and mingle with this millionaire status
And send a mutha fucker to hell when he fuck with Brad-it's
The killer instinct that never left me
The southside still true to the game little lefty is back
Wit shit that mutha fuckers can't fade
Rhyming but still you mutha fuckers ain't paid
So how can one try to see the unseen
Before you step your ass to the square know one thing
It's closed curtain we leavin' mutha fuckers hurtin'
It's Rap-a-Lot Mafia life we all workin'
Punk we shut you down before you get it started
You can hate it but I'm goin' get mines and that's regardless- bitch
I got these niggas boo-hooin' like hoes
Jealous of the game I obtain and I chose
To exercise to the best of my ability
It ain't no mutha fuckin' kill me
I'm Untouchable

[Hook: Roger Troutman]
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
(I'm untouchable)
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
Un-touch a-ble out here baby

Un-touch a-ble out here baby[Verse 1: H-Town & Roger Troutman]
[H]It's a thin line, it's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I'm just getting in, I knock on the door
A voice sweet and low says, who is it?
She opens up the door and lets me in
Never do she once say, sir, where have you been?
No, she says, are you hungry?
Are you hungry, honey?
[R]Did you eat yet?
[H&R]Let me hang up your coat, your coat, your coat
[H]And the woman tells me, pass me your hat too
All the time she smiles, never raises her voice
It's 5 o'clock in the morning

[Hook: H-Town]
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

[Verse 2: H-Town]
The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That'll really really hurt you one day

Here I am laying in the hospital
Bandaged from feet to head
Ya see I'm in the state of shock baby
Just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman could do something like this to me
I didn't think she had the nerve, so here I am
I guess action speaks louder than words

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shirley Murdock]
The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That could hurt you one day

Dance floorDown for yours if you're down for mine
Ooooooo....
Nastyboy Klick, I would die for you
Down for yours if you're down for mine
Ooooooo....
Nastyboy Klick, are you down for your dj?
Down for yourz if you're down for mine

I'll be that man dropping skill
Give your body chills
Let me wine and dine you boo
No doubt that I'll be good to you
I like a girl that always gots my back
Whenever I need her she'll be standing with a mac
If you down to represent
And put your trust in me
Ain't scared of no guns
And let me run the street
Let me do what I gotta do
And show you I'm fine, love you blind
It's just that hook-ups take time
Ain't gotta have ends or a place to live
Smoking fat phillys
I'm still down wit you kid
So if you want it, come and get it, don't take too long
Cause in the valley of AZ
Finding fly females ain't hard
So come and take a ride
And if you swing to this bounce
Room 6-0-duece
That's what I'm all about
Fulfill your fantasies
And all of your desires
Lay back, pop the top up
And let me take you higher

[Chorus]
Loving you this way, I'll never lead you astray
I knew you were my D.O.G. when you put your trust in me
Down for yours if your down for mine (put your trust in me)
I'm down for yours, if your down with my flow, keep it going
I'm always down for my G
Down for yours if you're down for mine

Now all I need is a shorty with a mac like that
Victoria Secret, champagne, and bubble baths
Let the magic man rub you down like a magic lamp
And I'm getting 3 wishes
I likes that
Cause ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Abouts to giving you lovin like this Duke of Earl, uhh
Feel the lovin that I gots for you
Moet, candy, flowers and some diamonds too
Just to let you know how I feel for you
I dedicate my life and my soul to you
So now that you've been thinking of a man for your life
I promise if I get it
I'm a treat you right
Never playa hate
And always down to sex me
And every time I see you
Giving much respect to me
I'll be down for yours
If your down for mine
Cause a love like ours
Ain't easy to find

[Chorus]

What you want Goldilocks
Money can't buy
Butterscotch made divine
Styles like Calvin Klein
Design for the masses
No style you sport clashes
Hazardous to the health of all men
Beauty descends, dividends, lust remains
Heavenly same my intent ignites flames
Exclaim, never complain
To give you affection
If being right's so wrong
You never need correction
Most definitely you get the best of me at times
If lovins what I need
You supply all kinds
I see your brown eyes scheming from across the room
Checking me out but you look away....
No reason to gaze
Look where the game
Competitions the same
Too many heinas lookin good
For me and you to keep playin
So what it be
I'm down for whatever you need
Just me and you
Hand in hand
Roaming through ecstasy

[Chorus]

Down for yours, down for mine, OoOoOo....
Down for yours if you're down for mine
More bounce for my G's
You're my computer love
More bounce G's
Down for yours if you're down for mine
Down for yours if you're down for mine
I want to be your G, baby, I want to be your G
Yes I do

Before you left me
I had it all
You were with me
And that was enough

He came along
And I forgot all about you
I was a fool
But I'm wiser now

[Chorus:]
Because you left
My world came to an end
(I tell you my world came to an end)
Then you came back again
(Then you brought it all together again)

Now I know
(Ooh)
There is no (there's no way) way
(There's no way)
I can go on without you
(I can go on without you)
You

[Verse 2:]
A precious love
You took from me
Opened my eyes
And now I can see

A one night affair
Can be so unfair
But I paid the price
So I'm wiser now

[Repeat Chorus x2:]


[Verse 3:]
Never again
Will I let you go
Now that you're home
I missed you so

Mmm, hmm
I love you forever
Cause you've earned my love

And I just wanna say
It's because of you
I'm wiser now

[Chorus:]
Because you left
(Because you left)
My world came to an end
(You see, my world came to an end)
Then you came back
(Nobody but you) again

It's 8 O'clock and

Her desk is down the hall
How I wish that I could call
To tell her my love is hers

[Hook]
We work together so lets be lovers
We work together so lets be lovers

[Verse 2]
Too shy to ask her if she
Belongs to anyone else
I see no ring on her finger (Love incorporated)
I'm standing there at her desk
Wondering which words will work best
When our eyes meet it's just love
Lets start a love incorporated

[Hook]
We work together so lets be lovers
We work together so lets be lovers
Everybody needs some love sometimes (Yes they do)
Everybody needs a love incorporated
Everybody needs some love sometimes

[Verse 3]
This time I'm gonna speak for real
Gonna tell her just how I feel
Even if she doesn't love me (Love incorporated)
Now we're standing face-to-face
And she forces me to wait
She tells me that she's in love (Love incorporated)
She was in love as can be
But she did not want me to see
That she was in love with me
She knows it's me right from the start
She know I can share her heart
She looked at me and said "Lets have a love incorporated"
Lets start a love incorporated

[Hook]
We work together so lets be lovers
We work together so lets be lovers

[ VERSE 2: KAM ]
How much mo' can I take
I'm all alone in a world gone mad
Brothers is doin bad
I had hopes and dreams, it seems like though nobody care
Who says life is fair cause ain't no justice out here nowhere
I prepare myself to hold court right here in the street
Don't come at me with no b.s., homie, give me five feet
I can't get no sleep, peace and quiet or rest
I got ulcers, migraines and pains in my chest
So God bless my soul, I feel old when I'm not
But physically and mentally I'm going through a lot
I know my time on this big blue baloon is short
Stress and pray everyday while people playin sport
Worry myself sick, so I be tryin to stay active
But death is lookin more and more attractive
Lord have mercy, why me, I know you ain't make no mistake
But look at what a brother down here goin through for yo sake

[ VERSE 2: KAM ]
Don't think I'm happy, homie, just because you see me grinnin
But honest, ma, stress got my head spinnin
And I'm just tryin to be polite, I had a real rough night
And I don't wanna see no friends until I get my ends right
I got enough problems, and it's messin up my health
I keep puttin my family and friends before myself
When I'm the one who need help but too proud to ask for it
When there's somethin wrong with me y'all be the last to know it
Cause I don't show it, I handle it and privately suffer
Havin patience is a mutha
Trials and tribulations, that's how my lessons begin
I'm overpowered by death and the impressions of men
I'm tryin to overcome these obstacles that I meet
With women, kids, work, religion and my friends in the street
I done spread myself too thin, fell into a trap
And I'm just about ready to snap
