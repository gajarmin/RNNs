Let the music take control of your body tonight
Whoa, everything's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight
Father break it down

(Father MC)
Well I begin the weekend with a groove
Roll about eight deep now what's my next move
Waitin to nightfall so I can enjoy
System pumped by four Jeeps, runnin like a convoy
Roll to the park, kinda crowded, what a scene
Pullin up with Jodeci blastin out the fifteen
So I park my ride, girls see my ???
Notice my grill that cause the pointin and starin

(Chorus-Jodeci)
Everything's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight
Ooh, everything's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight

(Father MC)
Now I sign a couple autographs, take a few flicks
Order Don Perionne and lay back with my chicks
Michael's on the left of me, Smooth is flippin
Took ??? away, I'm on the dance floor rippin
?? is for the cutie, the ??? I'm tryna' find 'em
Tim is in the front and Mobat is right behind him
And me, I'm just layin on the prowl
Got' say what's up as the girls cry out
She grabbed her man, I think she tried to play him
My only thought, was to step to the A-M
Cause I came to have a good time
And at the end of the night, no doubt, I'm gonna get mine
Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain, if you know what I mean
Understand I'm not conceeded, Father's just mellow
I'm a smooth, dark Romeo, freak kinda fellow

(Chorus)

(Father MC)
Do that dance, do that dance, baby
Do that dance, let's work it out
(Both) Do that dance, do that dance, baby
(Both) Do that dance, let's work it out
Do that dance, do that dance, baby
Do that dance, let's work it out
(Both) I said do that dance, do that dance, baby
(Both) Do that dance, let's work it out

(Father MC)
Loungin on the DL, this type of night is rare
I glanced to the right, oh who do we have here
Puffin Sweet, gettin ripped, what the hell
I see Mr. Uptown, it's Andre Farwell
Conversatin with his boys
I say stop and barge straight through the crowd
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mellow so I leap
To the center where the soul's rollin five deep
Mark Currey, a ??, kin and nephew
Doin the wild thing cause the soul is true
And everytime I see bodies gettin biz'
Girls are gettin wild cause Father's known for his
And everytime ya hear the music thumpity-thump
And all the girls gettin bumped right in ya rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor tonight

(Chorus) 2x

(Jodeci)
Everybody dance with me, ohh yeah

Everybody dance with me

[Hook]
(What's the law?)
Pimp or die
(What's the law?)
Pimp or die
(What's the law?)
Pimp or die
(What's the law?)
Pimp or die
To my niggas uptown gotta pimp or die
To my niggas downtown gotta pimp or die
To my niggas cross town gotta pimp or die
To my nigga round town gotta pimp or die

[Verse One]
I just jump in my Path
Drive up the ave
Talking on my cellular
Hunting for [?]
I'm the man, that's how I gets down
I find recruits, knock the boots and then I gots to skip town
I gets money on the regular
Every day [?] honies are calling on my cellular
I got a team
From Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens
A bald head, leather jacket, and baggy jeans
I roll posse deep
Check your catalog
My name's Father and Tim Dawg's the landlord
Buttnaked's in effect
They stepped up and said, "Yo Father, it's time to catch wreck"
Straight up and down, bless this underground
Brother don't play around
So watch a real nigga get down
So don't play me, cause I'm just too fly
It's '93 and '93 is pimp or die

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I attack when I crush the new jacks
And if I get stacks, I get stacks and stacks and stacks and stacks
I front gold, a slim chain and a rollie band
From my head to my toe, the toe is Timberland
You got bank, but moneygrip I got your bank stop
I'm not cock diesel but I still sport a tank top
That's how I'm living
So don't give me the dead eye
My last cutie played fly but now she's [?] goodbye
I make tonight on the town
And if it ain't good enough
I work harder than Bobby Brown
[?] caramel, sweet chocolate
One taste of my love makes your heart drip
Mr. Man
Sisters never diss the program
Before I kick 'em out
[?]
Straight up and down check me out as I catch wreck
Hold your spinny cause I'm running through your projects

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Here comes a bigger nigga
A slick daddy-o
I got a dozen honies naked on my patio
Smitty's gonna be around the sugar baby
I never rush, I never tell them "yes", it's "maybe"
Ladies it don't come easy
You gotta go all out like your whole purpose in life was to please me
I like 'em tender with a fight like a tiger then surrender
I'll make everyday like Sweet November
I get my nails done, baby ya won't be bitter
Dip my hands in the bowl and watch my rocks glitter
That's how pimply I am
Pimping ain't hard, it's just a job and ya really don't understand
I'm getting money on the real nothing's funny
Everyday seems sunny when I'm chilling with my main honey
So don't play me cause I'm just too fly
It's '93 and '93 is pimp or die

System pumped by four Jeeps, runnin like a convoy
Roll to the park, kinda crowded, what a scene
Pullin up with Jodeci blastin out the fifteen
So I park my ride, girls see my ???
Notice my grill that cause the pointin and starin

(Chorus-Jodeci)
Everything's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight
Ooh, everything's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight

(Father MC)
Now I sign a couple autographs, take a few flicks
Order Don Perionne and lay back with my chicks
Michael's on the left of me, Smooth is flippin
Took ??? away, I'm on the dance floor rippin
?? is for the cutie, the ??? I'm tryna' find 'em
Tim is in the front and Mobat is right behind him
And me, I'm just layin on the prowl
Got' say what's up as the girls cry out
She grabbed her man, I think she tried to play him
My only thought, was to step to the A-M
Cause I came to have a good time
And at the end of the night, no doubt, I'm gonna get mine
Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain, if you know what I mean
Understand I'm not conceeded, Father's just mellow
I'm a smooth, dark Romeo, freak kinda fellow

(Chorus)

(Father MC)
Do that dance, do that dance, baby
Do that dance, let's work it out
(Both) Do that dance, do that dance, baby
(Both) Do that dance, let's work it out
Do that dance, do that dance, baby
Do that dance, let's work it out
(Both) I said do that dance, do that dance, baby
(Both) Do that dance, let's work it out

(Father MC)
Loungin on the DL, this type of night is rare
I glanced to the right, oh who do we have here
Puffin Sweet, gettin ripped, what the hell
I see Mr. Uptown, it's Andre Farwell
Conversatin with his boys
I say stop and barge straight through the crowd
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mellow so I leap
To the center where the soul's rollin five deep
Mark Currey, a ??, kin and nephew
Doin the wild thing cause the soul is true
And everytime I see bodies gettin biz'
Girls are gettin wild cause Father's known for his
And everytime ya hear the music thumpity-thump
And all the girls gettin bumped right in ya rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor tonight

(Chorus) 2x

(Jodeci)
Everybody dance with me, ohh yeah
Everybody move with me, everybody
Everybody dance with me
Everybody move with me
Everything's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight[Father MC: Talking]

Chorus X8
Till fade[Intro: Buttnaked Tim Dawg]
And that was Father MC featuring Jodeci with their smash hit, 'Treat 'Em Like They Wanna Be Treated'. Well radioland, I wonder what he has in store for '93. Maybe he'll take it to the streets. But anyway, this is the Buttnaked one signing off for WBUTT FM in stereo

[Hook]
(What's the law?)
Pimp or die
(What's the law?)
Pimp or die
(What's the law?)
Pimp or die
(What's the law?)
Pimp or die
To my niggas uptown gotta pimp or die
To my niggas downtown gotta pimp or die
To my niggas cross town gotta pimp or die
To my nigga round town gotta pimp or die

[Verse One]
I just jump in my Path
Drive up the ave
Talking on my cellular
Hunting for [?]
I'm the man, that's how I gets down
I find recruits, knock the boots and then I gots to skip town
I gets money on the regular
Every day [?] honies are calling on my cellular
I got a team
From Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens
A bald head, leather jacket, and baggy jeans
I roll posse deep
Check your catalog
My name's Father and Tim Dawg's the landlord
Buttnaked's in effect
They stepped up and said, "Yo Father, it's time to catch wreck"
Straight up and down, bless this underground
Brother don't play around
So watch a real nigga get down
So don't play me, cause I'm just too fly
It's '93 and '93 is pimp or die

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I attack when I crush the new jacks
And if I get stacks, I get stacks and stacks and stacks and stacks
I front gold, a slim chain and a rollie band
From my head to my toe, the toe is Timberland
You got bank, but moneygrip I got your bank stop
I'm not cock diesel but I still sport a tank top
That's how I'm living
So don't give me the dead eye
My last cutie played fly but now she's [?] goodbye
I make tonight on the town
And if it ain't good enough
I work harder than Bobby Brown
[?] caramel, sweet chocolate
One taste of my love makes your heart drip
Mr. Man
Sisters never diss the program
Before I kick 'em out
[?]
Straight up and down check me out as I catch wreck
Hold your spinny cause I'm running through your projects

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Here comes a bigger nigga
A slick daddy-o
I got a dozen honies naked on my patio
Smitty's gonna be around the sugar baby
I never rush, I never tell them "yes", it's "maybe"
Ladies it don't come easy
You gotta go all out like your whole purpose in life was to please me
I like 'em tender with a fight like a tiger then surrender
I'll make everyday like Sweet November
I get my nails done, baby ya won't be bitter
Dip my hands in the bowl and watch my rocks glitter
That's how pimply I am
Pimping ain't hard, it's just a job and ya really don't understand
I'm getting money on the real nothing's funny
Everyday seems sunny when I'm chilling with my main honey
So don't play me cause I'm just too fly
It's '93 and '93 is pimp or die

[Hook]
