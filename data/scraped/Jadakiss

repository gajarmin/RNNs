[Intro]
My nigga if you ain't coppin' you ain't got no business around the fucking spot
Fuck you hangin 'round the trap for?
Up out my dope house

[Hook]
Booking on the interstate I'm bailing with them bricks
Cooking with the flour, hit me if you need the fish
Bottom of the ninth, choppers loaded, that's the ball game
Pussy you a target and I barely ever miss
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house

[Verse 1 - Chinx]
No degrees but did my thing in culinary
Either that or could've hit them courts and hoop
Creep up on them with them hammers we gon' nail em
Keep my pistols smoking like some Campbell soup
D.A. tryna lock me up for child abuse cause I was whippin' babies
In the daycare, and pushed em off the stoop
Chopper with the scope, tell them niggas merry Christmas
But it won’t be Santa Claus niggas sending through your roof
Catch a nigga hanging round the trap, he need to buy something
I’mma do the chicken dance with Flocka when them pies come
Pull up to the dock and park the fee up on the boat
Pussy nigga, guarantee less than a key will get you smoked
When that money come in, you and some your niggas fall out
Hate it when you pull up to the venue with them cars out
All my diamonds blue, [?] jeweler got me on some LOC shit
And them killers with me down to shoot, ain’t with no ho shit

[Hook]
Booking on the interstate I'm bailing with them bricks
Cooking with the flour, hit me if you need the fish
Bottom of the ninth, choppers loaded, that's the ball game
Pussy you a target and I barely ever miss
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
Yeah, fuck up out my dope house, where them niggas came from
Montega Jada, where you think I got the name from
Raised round the junkies, where you think I got my game from
Soon as the love stop, that’s when the pain come
We ain’t selling bundles either, we just moving big shit
Try to disappear with some work, get your wig split
You can try to find a vein or you can sniff shit
Get it on the arm then I need a little interest
Naw you can’t live with us, we don’t want no visitors
People call us drug dealers, I say we distributors
Haters gone hate cause we keep making em sick of us
Keep making it hot, they gone think about evicting us

[Hook]
Booking on the interstate I'm bailing with them bricks
Cooking with the flour, hit me if you need the fish
Bottom of the ninth, choppers loaded, that's the ball game
Pussy you a target and I barely ever miss
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house
Fuck up out my dope house

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
Cause my niggas still selling dope like they ain't on their third strikes
Camping out in that corridor, fuck you waiting on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for 23, just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare nigga, (Woo!) Ric Flair nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair nigga, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, coke money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit – ungrateful niggas, I don't like
Rrrah!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same, nigga I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang! Riding for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Going hard the whole night cause I ain't going back to my old life
I promise

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like[Intro]
You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing

[Verse 2: Drake]
Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap shit and got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'mma need some fuckin goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfucking field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, tempur-pedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop potato salad[Intro: DJ Drama]
We all get caught in our own sins
Sometimes I have to remind myself
That on my worst day I live like somebody on their greatest
Don't let your demons take you to hell, introduce them to heaven

[Hook]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doing life, they ain't ever coming home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me cause she said I did her wrong
Cause I left to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listening to me
That back and forth arguing was getting in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part time
I used to play the block early morning and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rapping brought me back to life
Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strapping like we was in Iraq to fight
Cause niggas getting murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Woah, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boiling water, in the world of no order
In the hood ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'mma get the fam right, nigga you damn right

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hopping out of shit
Right now I'm praying for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell a difference
My man coming home, my other man getting sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hating on your pictures
We dream chasing, y'all niggas walking behind wishes
Without working for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothing all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a head shot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the devil, he's see through

[Hook][Intro: Fabolous]
Niggas got me on my Brooklyn shit
Aye, what I told 'em? I said
Being hot get you the MVP
Stayin' hot get you the hall of fame
It's Loso (Brooklyn forever!)
Shmurda, what up, son?
Brooklyn, what up, son? Huh?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, I hit my shmoney dance when I caught the lick
I hit my shmoney dance when I caught ya chick
I Bobby Shmurdered that when she came 'round
Threw the hat up in the air, it never came down
And I just caught that body like a week ago
Real quick, click clack, get to freakin', ho
She want some hot nigga chillin' out in Mykonos
Or thot niggas all summer, every weekend, ho
I ain't no killer but don't push me, yo
I had 'em killers in yo' bushes, yo
Them trick niggas splurge on the pussy, yo
You give me one day, I'll Purge on that pussy, yo
You ain't seen these kicks since like the fifth grade
Back when Bo Jackson and Ken Griffey played
On my 90s flow, nigga, Young OG shit
On my GSC, Meet the Family shit

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Can't hold you forever, you gon' get a date
Tell 'em free my nigga Critter Mate
Hold ya head to all my niggas in the state
D-Block, GS9, nigga, get it straight
Got the semi and fully on me
Gloves, mask and a hoodie on me
Case we need to steal a V, I got the pully on me
I know you shocked, right? They got me on bully, homie
It's fake love cause they really hatin'
For my downfall, they really waitin'
Hundred yardies, a hundred Haitians
I'm a hot nigga by affiliation

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, fresh up out the county, I done did a lil bid
Let the popos run up on me, I won't tell them coppers shit
All this money in my pocket, you might think I sold a brick
I got four hoes and some Hen, some low pros on my Benz
And if I catch that nigga slippin', I'mma shut him down
Let my homies separate his body, call that Seven Pounds
Better cool out, I'm nice with the hands
You keep talking that shit, I'll knock you out
A nigga be pickin' you up off of the ground for thinkin' you 2Pac
And shawty give me neck till I pass out
And she just gettin' checks cause her ass out
Makin' money, gotta be the fast route
Bitch, if you ain't fuckin', better get yo' ass out

[Verse 4: Rowdy Rebel]
Pow! Pow! That chopper make him Diddy Bop
Free Slice Billy, let my billy rock
And free A-billi, let A-billi out
When Flex drop a bomb on us, watch the city rock
Made Diddy shmoney dance right on Biggie block
Make him bring a hundred bands and the city out
When Fresh pull up in that brand new yop
Watch me slide off wit' ya thot cause I'm worth about a milli now
Niggas think cause we dancin' 'round, niggas won't get shot
That's Bobby Shmurda, not Bobby Brown, known to pop up on the block
These pussy niggas better calm it down, get the same drop from that thot
And these fuck niggas don't come around cause they know they gon' get shot

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Fuck around and get ya shit popped
Like hanging out too long on 91st and Winthrop
See, you the type to probably get got
See, this where all the fuckery nigga shit stop
Shawty climb this money mountain to the tip-top (get it)
Throw a hundred fifty on my wrist (watch)
Stayed with the heat, they call me Chris Bosh
Angry cause niggas see me leavin' the bitch block
Shout my nigga Web, shout my nigga Luger
Free my nigga Smiles, free my nigga Scooter
I suggest you probably pray to Buddha
Conglomerate and GS9 niggas full of shooters

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about a hot nigga
My dogs'll sit and watch, nigga
Fuck the judge, we never cop, nigga
Who the first to bring that Lambo on the block, nigga?
Poppin' Aces in the studio wit' Bobby 'nem
Before all the labels started callin' him
Cause bitch, I understand him cause I'm one of them
So know you hatin' on me if you hatin' on them
Memphis shooters, that's who we are
Made a million out a glass jar
Cocaine, I got dope bars
My nigga Snootie just caught a gun charge
Fuck a law, we gon' ride strapped, bitch
We be bout that beef, fuck that rap shit
And free my nigga Meek, I'm on my Philly shit
And my New York bitch from Dyckman, she Dominican

[Verse 7: Bobby Shmurda]
Grimy savage, that's who we are
Grimy shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my Gun Squad
And bitch, if it's a problem, we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Raw
Broad daylight and we gon' let them thangs bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, ho
Some way, free Breezy, ho
And tell my niggas Shmurda teamin', ho
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck wit' us and then we tweakin', ho
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezin', ho
Everybody catchin' bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully, yo
I'mma run up, put that gun on him
I'mma run up, go dumb on him
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go dumb shit

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda]
Got me on that go dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this muhfucka, hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
You ain't never counted paper 'til your thumbs hurt
You ain't never had to make do wit' bum work
Shit ain't comin' back, you get delirious
It's a job in these streets, shit is serious
My 'migo got locks in the city mud
Back against the wall and I need a plug
Flew the fam to the yams, verse the Heat
I had twenty thousand grams just last week
Shit stopped comin', bills keep comin' 'round
Holdin' on my last bird, 'bout to break it down
Charged you higher out of town, then I went in Brooklyn
Phone blowin' up, the homies ask how it's lookin'
You think if I had the work
I wouldn't call you to sell it, you fuckin' jerk?
You start gettin' mad, talkin' out of frustration
In the game, six figures can easily turn to nothin'
Damn, I'm hot, dog
The fork on the Masi grill pickin' up guap, dog
Bought a white house off blocks dog
In the presidential, watch me go to the top, dog

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Man, I got that glow
I done came on up from the motherfuckin' floor
Couple niggas be hatin', I Just be like, 'So?'
I never get mad, I just get that dough
If the shit get bad, then I let that go

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
You do it cause you have to, I do it cause I could
And this is all factual, I do it for the hood
Cock the four, cop and go
Cause these drugs are for sale, they are not for show
Keep a eye on the monitors and lock the doors
No comprende unless it's 'bout lots of dough
They love it, they still want it, the block is still haunted
Turbo in the garage, the cover is still on it
One hundred bundles by 9AM, it's a ill mornin'
A nigga lookin' good, the bitches is still on him
Money, power, mega respect
Al-Qaeda is how I got the montega connect
If that paper ain't right, they put the K to your neck
Give your family a visit, they send your baby a threat
A lil' deeper than the repurcussions on the block
But that all bein' said, is you hustler or not?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I don't get mad, I get dough, I get bags and get low
Everybody wit' me good, my bitch bad as shit though
You get gas, you Citgo, we whip ass, we Klitschko
It gets bad and shit slow, we really with the shits, bro
Twist your cap for it, Kinda sick with the thirst too
When I'm hungry, I ain't myself, Snickers commercial
I got to eat before a nigga catch a attitude, And Start looking at the game like its platter food
Fuck sandwiches, I want the chips and dip
Whips are quick, Contours, seats grips the hip
That's 63 Talk, at least a hundred grand to understand
They put me on a flyer for twenty, I'm a wanted man
Son of Sam, I was born in '77
The bitch a late-night Slurpee, She 7/11
Yeah, the family, so you gotta love it
I'm a boss, so I got it covered

[Hook][Produced by D-Dot (The Mad Rapper)]

It's all about the Benjamins baby
It's all about the Benjamins baby

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Now, what y'all want to do
Want to be ballers, shot callers, brawlers
Who be dipping in the Benz with the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Trying to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah living the raw deal, three course meals; spaghetti, fettuccine and veal
But still everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for trying to bury
Seven zeros over in Rio Di Janeiry
Ain't nobody's hero, but I want to be heard
On your Hot 9-7 every day, that's my word
Swimming in women with they own condominiums
Five plus fives, who drive Millenniums
It's all about the Benjamins, what
I get a fifty pound bag of eu for the mutts
Five carats on my hands with the cuts
And something European chromed out with the clutch, what

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I want it all figured out, fuck being a broke nigga
Drinking malt liquor, driving a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch we kept ours, popping Cristals
Freaking the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'm a scheme
We see through, that's why nobody never going to believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you
Because I leave you, I'm only here
For that green paper with the eagle

[Verse 3: Sheek]
I'm strictly trying to cop those colossal sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's
Mienda, with cash flowing like Sosa
And the Latin chick transporting in the chocha
Stampeding over, pop Mo's, never sober
Lex and Range Rovers dealing weight by Minnesota
Avoiding narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Alona
From Daytona, when I was young I want to bone her
But now I only hit chicks that win beauty pageants
Tricking and taking me skiing, at the Aspens
Gangsta mental, stay popping Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown
Pinkie ringing, gondolas with the man singing
Italian music down the river with your chick clinging
To my bizzalls, player you mad false
Acting hard when you as pussy as RuPaul

[Hook]
It's all about the Benjamins baby
It's all about the Benjamins baby
Now, what y'all want to do
It's all about the Benjamins baby
Want to be ballers, shot-callers
It's all about the Benjamins baby
Brawlers, who be dipping in the Benz with the spoilers
It's all about the Benjamins baby
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
What the blood clot
Want to bumble with the Bee huh
Bzzz throw a hex on the whole family
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Have your friends singing "this is for my homies"
And you know me from making niggas so sick
Floss in my six with the 'Lex on the wrist
If it's murder, you know she wrote it
German Ruger for your ass bitch, deep throat it
Know you want to fill the room because it's platinum coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you should've toted
Suck a dick all that bullshit you kick
Player hating from the sideline
Get your own shit, why you riding mine
I'm a Goodfella kinda lady
Stash 380s in Mercedes, Puffy hold me down baby
Only female in my crew and I kick shit
Like a nigga do, pull the trigger too, fuck you!

[Verse 5: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I been had skills, Cristal spills
Hide bills in Brazil, about a mill' the ice grill
Make it hard to figure me liquor be kicking me
In my asshole, undercover Donnie Brasco
Left my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl
My West coast shorty, push the chrome 740
Rocking Redman and Naughty, oh where's my kitty cat
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm living that fo' life, we push weight
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State
Listen close it's Francis, the praying mantis
Attack with the Mac, my left hand spit, right hand
Grip on the whip, for the smooth getaway
Player haters get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off til I'm empty, don't tempt me
Only to Hell I send thee, all about the Benji's
What

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
It's all about the Benjamins baby
(repeat)[Hook]
100, 100, 100, 100 (x8)
You know I keep it (x4)

[Pusha T]
My life is but a dream pullin' cars up
Told you motherfuckers keys open doors up
Never excited when I'm seen with something gorgeous
Put highway miles on these bitches like a tour bus
Daddy Warbucks, without a born trust
Diamonds all on this black gold like an oil rush
The highest quality, the chains are all flush
Known Jacob since the nineties so he spoils us
Stock spoilers, no kits on 'em
Why Panamera, nine-eleve shits on 'em
Chuck the deuce as I Tokyo drift on 'em
The top drops like this Bangladesh heat on 'em

[Hook]
100, 100, 100, 100, you never keep it (x4)

[Jadakiss]
Yo, get yourself a hundred years tryin' to be the boss
Stand next to the chandeliers, you could see the shards
Ain't no diamonds in the watch, but you see the cross
When you spoon feed them that dope they need it more
All night, sweet sales
Four pipes, V twelves
Yeah, you know what them grams do
Bad bitch with me that the industry ain't ran through
Na, I ain't stop hustling yet, but I plan to
Own a bunch of vehicles and a bunch of land too
Yeah and I love it when the rush come
Ain't no secret that I keep it ninety-nine plus one

[Hook x2]
100, 100, 100, 100, you know I keep it
100, 100, 100, 100, you never keep it

[Mr. Bangladesh]
Y'all niggas fifty-fifty I keep it a hundred
I spit the truth in interviews, I keep it one hundred
I'm the shit, smell the fumes, my nigga we plungin'
And the 808s on a leash, they say it's a monster
Got my own label, fucked around and signed myself
Had a plan and stuck to it, you fuckboys is stuck boy
Bangladesh new shit ropin' like a cowboy
On my Tony Romo shit, you niggas just some towel boys
Tell the whole world to suck my cockiness
My checks eight figures like a octopus
Three hundred thou for the watch and rocky shit
These other niggas fakin' and I ain't afraid to say I keep it

[Hook x2]

[2 Chainz]
A hundred miles and running, nigga with an attitude
Bitch I'm so fly, you should check the altitude
I'm ballin', ballin' like an alley-oop
My girl heel so high she need a parachute
Get 'em, I got 'em let me at 'em
My condo on Jupiter, my neighbors on Saturn
Murcielago, flow with some eye candy
I go to trial Monday, I been takin' panties
Hundred degrees in the mic booth
I'm from where you put golds on the white tooth
And when you walk in and she might look
Might get took, might get fucked
A bunch of bitches in the skip line
I'm known to get mine ten out of ten times
I paid a hundred thousand for the old school
Known to keep it one hundred on the Pro Tools

[Hook x2][Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm 1 up, pussy nigga run up
Play me for a ho and Ima pull up with a gun up
Bitch, you see the chain, got me looking like the sun up
All that old fly shit will get a nigga done up
Believe that, I'm 1 up (x8)

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah
H-Town, Money Gang, Nigga ain't shit slow
Got the hood trippin, trunk sound like a kick, tho
Hustle Gang everythang, tell them niggas get dough
Young Tom posted at the skill tryna get blow
Nigga, fuck the club, I hit a lot and let a bitch know
Four hoes ain't enough, tell em get six mo'
Strap it up, let a bitch ride it like a '64
When I'm done, send em to they whip and tell em get go
Then I'm back, mobbin through the city like a black ghost
First jacker thinkin I'm dinner, I keep black toast
Young Truth, never sick of cheese, no lactose
Jump out on a hater front step, hit em that close

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 2: Lil Boss]
Yeah
I'm 1 up, on the block from sun down to sun up
Mobbin through the city, I would never put my gun up
Chalupa on tuck mode, yelling out fuck hoes
Got a bitch naked in the club like "fuck clothes"
These niggas fucked around and woke the beast up
Back to the pony tails, khaki's and creased up
HGC til the whole word freeze up
Hand out the window while I'm throwin my C's up
Yeah, blaze my motherfuckin weed up
Fuck the police til them hoes lift these up
I'm on one, 7.62's penetrate
Piss me off at the wrong time, I'll demonstrate

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I wake up, bake up, gotta get my cake up
Pussy feel good, look great without no make-up
Real nigga here, not a faker
I hate y'all, a boss nigga certified player
Niggas want beef, give it to em like a waiter
Shorty want the wood, so you know I had to stake her
Treat her like her maker, get a room treat it like Jamaica
Just one time, treat it like a favour
The VIP's on me, you down to smoke
I got a couple zips on me
Got diamonds on but I be doin shit low-key
Don't gotta make a call, my niggas with the shits
Cause real niggas don't slip, bitch

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yo, I'm 1 up
Out here, still tryna come up
First you feel a burnin sensation, then you numb up
Act like you tryna hang and get hung up
Soon as you bang-bang, charges get brung up
Bring a nigga right to the register, get him rung up
Use to go see my connect and pick a ton up
Quickest way to get some respect, pick a gun up
And just start shooting whoever you in front of
Top 5 dead or alive, I'm just one of
One shot deal, one life, you get one love
All that old fly shit will get a nigga done up
Scoreboard clearly shows that I'm one up

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth][Verse 1: Ace Hood]
No one on the corner has swagger like this
Cause I'm so incredible they not compatible to me
Eat 'em up like I was cannibal, the cattle to a beast
Graduated from the hunger now it's rappers that I feast
And I'm coming for each and everyone of you that said I couldn't do
Now I'm swergity swagging on you bums doin' this interview
Call it an interlude, talking to you inner fools
Got nominated, I know they hate it, they sick of dude
But if you sick of new, I feed the lamers Theraflu
Get em man and buy a coupe and drop the roof
Adjust the cruise, show them what the swagger do
It's on the highest altitude
They can't fit my sneaker shoes, the best rapper attitude
See the younging in the zone
The beaches, see the features on my faces I can't erase because my swagger so amazing homles
Catch me at the top
I'm throwing Big J and hot metal
Balling like I'm Karl Malone
The next best is on!

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
There's only two men I fear when it comes to a battle:
God and my shadow
Everybody else get a ravelled, tangled, mangled, totally disabled
Hung from a roof watch 'em dangle
Then I make his wife feel the pain too: anal
Juelz Santana, forget those busters
The boy flows harder than Kimbo's punches
You boys betta step aside, before I get at guys
You just bugs I'm spittin' that pesticide
Your not mobsters, wait stop the fake, or get found dead with your head in that pasta plate
Money in the bank I benefit from my benefits
I'm making it while I'm spending it
You go to the Louie store, you go to the Gucci store
You go to the mall spend it all what you do that for
You could buy the rags, you could buy the bags
But there ain't no sign that say they sell swag
But you could watch me and do your best imitation
You need a little time, a little preparation
But sooner or later your gonna have to face it
I like a pent house, your a fixed up basement
As far a chicks go I get it you take it
I give 'em all Franks, they call me Nathan's

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Lyrically it don't matter, up-and-comer or a has be
I'm in your ass B who’s the next Raz-B
Wordplay king I'm not the one to Scrabble with
The rocks got more carats in it than rabbit shit
And after these ill lines, you might see why I need a deal sign
Cause everybody coming in this year is failing
Ask why and they just play Sarah Palin
I'd rather be in Maui para sailing
Cause when you in the lead you don't care who’s trailing
So get your little money you isn’t a threat
When we was making it rain you wasn’t drizzling yet
Right Meech? Death before dishonor
Their swaggers like mine cause I left it on the corner
So fly I gotta shop at the Sky mall
And this summer we getting more drops than eyeballs
Loso!

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
I told you this once Hip Hop is not dead
Change gon' come, just like Barack said
"Money, Power, Respect" like The Lox said
"You'll be the man of the house", my paps said
Heat the streets up, right quick it's all timing
Gucci everything, Sierra Leone diamonds
You could know so much yet but no nothing
If I don't know nothing else, bet I know hustling
This ain't even a rhyme, it's a controlled substance
Strictly iron swinging, no tussling
I just do business I don't do friends
Brand new M1's and 9mm's
As long as money's involved with it I'm in
You ain't gotta second guess the best, I'm him
I would rap circles around these new urkels
Everything is digital, pills are still purple
So I'm staying in my lane 'til it opens up
I'm like a sponge in the game just soaking up
Before I'm gone I deserve a hit
I know you heard of Kiss
This is the cypher, I murdered it![Refrain: Rick Ross]
600 Benz, house six hundred grand
That was six years ago, whips come from Japan
I get that work from my face
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
600 Benz, condo six hundred grand
I got twelve hundred kicks, them bitches straight from Japan
My ambition is wicked I put that shit on my hand

[Rick Ross]
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
I put that shit on my man

[Verse 1:Wale]
Wale, real nigga, where the totem, blowin' bomb haze
I just tell CJ keep on rollin’ that's my shorty
Tinted out, you ain't seeing through
All black everything, this shit like a HBCU
Maybach music, major moves
I’m saving major loot
I make my old bitch buy me all the latest shoes
One whip just ain't enough, I just seen 33
You only half a W without a second V
Gotta be dreamin, gotta be chosen
Shawty when I was 20 I had a Camry and tokens
But now I’m ok, bitch I got my shit together
Rozay told me keep on working, shawty you’ll be rich forever, ever
Forever my endeavours and I sever my opponents
I’m cold like its in Denver
The dilemma is, you think I got no conscience
You think I just here flossing and talking?

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Dependin' on how I feel, either the coupe or sedan
I’m only dealin' with you, nothin' to do with your man
Niggas ruin your plans, it’s best to do what you can
I’m up to six hundred bricks, started with two hundred grams
Hand to hand in the cold
Pockets on hella swole
I was breakin' ‘em down, now I’m sellin' ‘em whole
Work straight out the kitchen
Ain't no competition
You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission
Know you want me to fall
I don’t do nothing but ball
You heard I was in jail, well I just came from the mall
I’m on my way to the jeweler bout to cop me a Muller
Keep the digital ruler at arm's length of the Ruger
Life’s a bitch and I feel her
Ain't nobody iller, perico Godzilla
Catch me blowing vanillas
Used to be blood money

Now it’s go hard scrilla
After I count it all up, I’ma go to the dealer and get a…

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Hope you heard that intro
This that I been grindin' cause I’ve been savin' for that Benz flow
To mash on assholes with petty badges
Tell em’ niggas we throwed, but they never gon catch us
If I am pulled over, I know they gon be on it
Cause it’s hot in here and I got no L like the ’72 Dolphins
Woooh, race my niggas, and I bet you never pass me like a free safety
I’m Polamalu, 600 the newest model
My newest motto to use a condom with newest models
Uhh, got a hundred on the dash, young
Ya ain't killers ya’ll got hundred yard dash guns
I’m a rare one, camo’s and some rare ones
Where I'm from is a circus hope you don’t expect a fair one
Dropping hundreds like it ain't nothin'
Really it was but you know I never sayin’ nothin'

[Hook][Intro]
I asked him if he wanted me to hustle up his bail, but he said "No."
He just didn't give a damn anymore

[Hook]
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door

[Verse 1: Papoose]
They would say “bling-bling,” if my jewels could talk
So you can still see me shining when the room gets dark
I’m like Tony Danza, I’ll show you who’s the boss
Teach my worker who’s the fiends and who’s the narcs
It’s a lot of niggas out trying to prove they hard
‘Til you hit they cousin up, and make them move they aunt
Yo, I would wild out and let the Rug’ just spark
But you know how the hood be when someone screwed your start
All the basketball tournaments was cool to watch
Bet your money: lose a little, or lose a lot
They beat us by one point – yeah, them dudes was sharp
But I’m a sore loser, so I had to shoot up the park
I wouldn’t of robbed your man if the fool was smart
But a fool and his money will soon depart
Then I went to my crib, went to sleep 'bout four
When I woke up, police was at my door, damn…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Just aired the dice game out, that’s the truth, babe
‘Bout to hit the crib, take a shower, watch a bootleg
Glad nothing popped off, got to get the bag out of the crib
Goose dropped off, so it can get knocked off
Then I got a sharp pain in my chest
About knowing I ain’t supposed to have it in the place I rest
Yes, but it’s a half a joint in there
Two .40 cals with the hollow points in there
Few bricks of diesel, couple pounds of purple
Gallon of the water, plus a thousand circles
A man hit me, saying that he’d be here in a minute
All I’ve got to do is wrap it, and bring it down to the rented
By now, it’s a little past five
And I’m still trying to roll, could barely open my eyes
Next thing I know, she giving me a massage
Instead of waking up rich, I woke up to a surprise

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
It goes, “Six in the morning, police at my door”
At five in the morning, I was up in this broad
At four in the morning, we was out the club door
A few hours before that, I was getting fresh in the store
Now a week before that, I was at the car lot
Thinking convertible so I can make the broad drop
A half a mill in cash off a three-month run
Them rubber bands stacks in ten-G lump sums
Police is on our back ‘cause we dump guns
So when Bird Gang’s outside, motherfucker, just run
We just dumb, like the hyphy life
I told you life was a bitch, not the wifey type
Help you get the right bricks, if the price is right
Catch you standing on the strip in the icy whites
Season of heirs, we in the V switching gears
Dropping the top, blowing weed in the air
She’s showing her ass, and
Next think I know, I’ve got a detective all in my face
Asking me all kinds of questions
I don’t know shit but get my lawyer

[Hook][Intro]
You know they gon’ say
What Diggy know bout '88?
Well I know this much
They made a lotta money back then
And that’s what mine lookin’ like

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Aye lil' nigga, it’s Diggy, got the key to the city
Check my family tree, you know uncle taught Diddy
Who turned around and taught Biggie and Biggie taught Jigga
So you can just imagine what he teaching me, nigga
My top down in the winter, my doors up in the summer
I pulled up to the light and I drove off with her number
88 is the number, like Michael Irvin but younger
Ain’t no preserving my hunger, no, they like, "Where did he come from?"
Well I got 2 years in and a couple of months
Yeah, the road was Bobby Brown, it had a couple of bumps
They be showing me love, minus a couple of chumps
In my best Chris Tucker voice, “Is this watchu want?!”

[Hook]
No need to front, homie pardon my back
I’m gettin it crazy, how retarded is that?
I’m playin’ my cards, got a fistful of ace’s
And these lil faces I’m spending, you prolly could trace it
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)

[Verse 2: Diggy]
I hear the hate, I don’t sweat it cause I’m getting that fetti’ (I said it)
I see a lot of mad rappers, Derric "D-Dot" Angelettie
Compliments to the chef, ya boy out here eatin great
Homie, you ain't no umpire, why you watchin my plate?
While you watchin my pockets, Jordan 3′s in my closet
I get it all sent to me so I don’t need to go to shopping
I ain’t braggin, I’m swagging, my fly ladies whats happening?
Shout to Nicki I’m an Aries and we go good with Sag’s
... Mm-hm
Hope that made you smirk, I’m a flirt like Kirk
With Dirty Money God made dirt and (uh) dirt don’t hurt
This for my niggas that’s getting it every month on the first

[Hook]
No need to front, homie pardon my back
I’m gettin it crazy, how retarded is that?
I’m playin’ my cards, got a fistful of ace’s
And these lil faces I’m spending, you prolly could trace it
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, that’s what my family was rockin’, I just sat back and watched em
I was only 13 so I ain’t know nothin bout coppin’
I just knew that they had it and if I asked then I got it
It all started from trees then it turned to narcotics
All the whips was exotic, all the chicks was erotic
Money was coming so fast, all you needed was product
And somebody to test it, find a good place to try it
Never keep nothin’ on you, find a good place to hide it
If I’m in it I own it cause if I like it I buy it
Keep the loud in the air, connect like that I’m quiet
How’d you hop in this platinum and you ain’t even near gold?
Cause I’m still spendin’ money that’s 24 years old!

[Outro]
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88!)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88!)[French Montana]
Hah!
Cuz I don’t know what they totin
You niggas smokin that Lamar Odom
88 coupes like a car lot
I be 88 stories off the floor high
You need the Phantom Rolls
Flippin work, comin back like Derrick Rose
Don’t call me, I’mma call you
Sicily, bread, olive oil
Stop beggin nigga I don’t owe you
And once you cross the line nigga I don’t know you
Make about quarter mill a week
Man that closet like Fashion Week
Slingin drugs, dealers got the package
I still make Salah 5 times a day
Tryna send mama to Mecca
While a nigga snortin pound with the liquor
Man watch for the stick up, (prrrp)
G-O-D GOD flow
Don Juan de Marco, lot like car show
Feel for ya, nobody to kill for ya
Wanna tell ya story but guys won’t bear with you
And nah, I ain’t tryna get bread wit you
So go and tell yo bitch to split the bill wit you
I'm countin commas, young die with honor
Turks and Caicos, still smoking marijuana
Corner block was ya boy owe us
Young boy shooter like Jamal Crawford
Bricks in the basement, givin niggas spaces
Clips in the Matrix, slid with the waitress
5 stars tell em, said she 16
Now that’s R. Kelly, my niggas war ready
Gifted and cursed, next step could be the worse
Next coupe could be ya hearse
Man this shit hard when it hurt though
My niggas slingin hard in front of church doors
Man slingin hard was the first tour
Now it's H. Fraud on a surf board
I be clean as a whistle
Team is official
Black and white diamonds, all I need is a whistle

[Jadakiss]
My weed is the issue
Now may I proceed to kiss you?
They put you where both of yall single men
Home-made speaker outta the Pringle can
Can’t wait to do your thing again
When they mention your name the bells ring again
Gettin that cake, it cause friction
They love turn that hate to addiction
Mind thinker but echo prescriptions
Up in the presidential suite with a vixen
A lot of suckers in the bizz
Good die young, sucka niggas live
Quickest way to go, fuckin with the kids
He ain’t gon stop til you pluck him with the SIG
Lost 100 thou, fuckin with the Knicks
Flyin on a brukler, bucket full of bricks
Last night club, fuck it, where the bitch
Cuz money in the field but I fuckin with the 6
Words of advice, run through the game
Niggas know the hood run through my veins
Real subtle with great poise
Pure bundles, a straight boy
Smoke loud, make noise
Dream Team, Wraith Boys
RIP Darry D and Nutty aka Troy

[Outro]
What?
D block & Coke Boys
Pushin
Yeah
Uh
Fuck wit me
Harry Fraud's a bad motherfucker
Yea
Uh
This shit is stupid[Jadakiss:]
Yo part 2 A.I. and J-Kiss presenting the A6
From the wrist can tell it's a straight swish
Now I'm the problem and he's the answer
As soon as you guard up you ain't got a
Chance to stop it anygiven time he can pop it
The Reebok A6 is hot go cop it

[Allen Iverson:]
2K3 I rock the A6 my new kicks
Take a few hits it ain't nothin I'm used to it
Tryna build a team I'm the player you need
Hard like Willis Reed I'll keep the score and the lead

[Jadakiss:]
It's no way to disguise your dream
Beside family the only thing that's on
His mind now is a ring
He got love for the game
His start was huge
And you seen him play hurt cause his heart is huge
6 feet 165 call iso anytime you wanna split your 5's
Play to win he don't play for stats
Brought the hood to the game and they love him for the braids and TATS
Yea, Trackmasters AI and J-Kiss make sure you go out and get a pair of the A6

[Both:]
Part 2 AI and J-Kiss presenting the A6 it's all fundamental and basics [x2][Hook: Hurricane Chris]
I'm in the club hollering
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay
I'm in the club hollering

[Verse 1: Game]
You can find me in the a bay bay
Bucket full of cry-stal V.I.Ped up
Going hard in body tap where they throw that cheese up
I been about my paper niggas know about my stack
You don't like that dirty money send your girl to wipe me down
Million dollars on my neck and wrist shine for a mile
She wanna see it up close then she gotta walk it out
I'm the king of this rap shit what the fuck they talking 'bout
Niggas can't sell records so they blame it on the South
I be all through Shreveport, Louisiana ballin'
Like who the fuck said ain't no choppers in New Orleans
My rims so clean they spinning like a whirlwind
Pull up at the club bitches texting they girlfriends
They know who I is they know who I am
I be flying through the south in that burgundy Lam'
Pull up at the light my shit so bright
She want my number shit call me tonight
Pick up the phone like

[Verse 2: Hurricane Chris]
Well its the H to tha U double R I C-A-N to tha E Get em up, Get em up, Get em up like
A bay bay that's what we say when we pull up in them trucks
Tell my label to cut the check I'mma go and spend it up
On the Bentley painted yellow like a baby school bus
26's make em stop when I pull up
And my pants sag low like I was rockin' a pull-up
When I stop and I pull up, I'mma be already full of Vodka
I keep that in my cup a bay bay on make me bussa
And if you try to take my chain I'mma snatch yo face off
I got diamonds in my ear the same size as baseballs
Where they at? They lost I don't thank they on my level
Lil mama thank I'mma bite her with this alligator sweater
A bay bay was just the beginning I'm finna run the game
Whoever feel different can holla at Hurricane
Wanna be talking but heavy itinerary break up yo chest if you running yo mouth
And every since I dropped that a bay bay I been running the South

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
A bay bay it's Lil Boosie
This for my dawgs who keep that cake and keep that uzi
Holla a bay bay

E'erbody riding 'round A bay bay fuck naw
Rubberbands round cash I'm making cake

Paint the caddy candy green hey bay bay
Anybody try to hate they gone feel that
In Baton Rouge keep a big bitch, attitude real rude
L.I.G I'm real cool don't thank that I'm a lil' dude
Beef to me like bar-b-que it's nothing at all
Thought that ratchet was a fool a bay bay goin' off

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Say that red hat them red B's wife B's
23's out the Bentley and we stay fly
Hundred G's P-R-P's hum V's

I'm from the three the thirteenth off the wild side
My young G and he a beast Tha Carter 3
That's more stuntin' but we hustlin' like it's do or die

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Angie Locc]
Ratchet dancing cross the floor you know the g-way
Hollerin' uuhh up on the mic with the DJ
I'm with my G's and my thugs and my ese's
Hiding 'hind the shades I been up for bout three days
Cut with curls in my hair got my L's in tha air
Waistin' drank everywhere 'cuz I 'cuz I don't care
With my niggas out that lava and you know we bad off
We the ones up in the cut with them blunts that make you cough
Trued all the way down from my head to my feet
I can't feel my face so please don't speak
You wanna know what we do when the club get packed?
What? Toss my set, raise my shirt, show that tat up on my back

[Verse 6: Jadakiss]
Yo look it ain't a game, 50 large is what I came with
25 for bottles 25 to make it rain with
This ain't Reggie Miller ma, this is kush and haze mixed
Don’t sit there and lie to me, you ain't never taste this
Hope the Lord forgive me gave my Jesus piece a face-lift
Stones is doing the Watusi in the bracelet
Ain't no stoppin' that, I be where the guap is at
Excuse me, I be wherever it's poppin' at
Now I'm on the dance floor, iced out, lights out
Wife-beater, true religion shorts and my Nikes out
Drinkin' out the bottle talking much shit, Dutch lit
Every bunny within arms reach wanna touch Kiss
Yes, and when I leave they all followin', just 'cuz I was in the club hollerin'

A bay bay, a bay bay[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I’m from the hard knock life, that all white life
Pop a wheelie on that 4 wheeler yea that's that bike life
Niggas ghost like casper catch me in a ghost with drop head after
You a slave master, rob your own kind blind lean blind
And I ain't join your team cause I got my own grind
Got my own mind, sold my own 9's, fifty five hundred like a hundred’s some times

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Once you put your hand on that pot
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around
Once you bust your first Glock
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around
Once you jump off that porch (young nigga)
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around
These streets hot as a torch (young nigga)
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I’m from the hard knock life, that all black life
Making sales on a mountain bike, yeah, that’s that crack life
Break a whole one down and sell ‘em all nics
Couple days later, four door six
Love to let the semi spray every day’s a henny day
Fuck it they gon charge you like you an adult anyway
Yeah, just look at those that took a nap
When you’re on the road to riches, nigga, ain’t no looking back

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Shots fired man down, says he was hands down
Police brutality, nigga, this reality
Trayvon Martin in a all black hoodie
Young nigga big 40 waiting on a bullet
Big benz is the world on drugs
Watching CNN and seen my god damn plug
Watching BET and seen my god damn self
I have more love for these streets than my god damn self

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Uhh Yea haha!
Young niggas wyling, shooting shit rapidly
To give him ten years, they do that happily
They don’t understand, they bringing down the faculty
Ain't worried about the fronters, it's the niggas that's in back of me
Grown man b.i., and that’s how they handle it
Reputation is everything, it’s over when you’re damaging
Money is easy to get, is just hard to manage it
Always remember the rules before you put your hand in it

[Verse 5: Yo Gotti]
Before you put your hand in it
You got to be the man in it
You got to understand it, got to know the rules to the game
Got to sacrifice, got to know it's a five year sentence for a brick of white
That's if your record clean Lord knows it’s a poor sight
Caugh up in the snitch, smash on em' you don't match now
Remember what I told you, fuck it, you can turn your back now
Once upon a time he was real, he a rat now
Never turn your back on niggas that you thug with
Bitch that you really like, never fall in love with
Never send your plug with the money up front
If you smoke get your own kush don't hit a nigga blunt
Remember dope gon sale and bitches gonna leave
Soon Niggas go to jail, so that’s a day from hell
Young nigga oh well, thinking he a player
Now he living through his pictures on the wall and his mail
But he ain’t tell, so nigga I salute em'
And when he hit the streets again, making sure he eat again
He gon' be a beast again, hit em' with a key again
For eighteen five, young nigga go live[Jadakiss]
Work wit me
I wanna thank y'all fa comin out
Tonight
Dis iz sum reel' shit
Ah--hah

[Jadakiss]
First things first
When a nigga money ain't right
That makes things worst
Now he's just breathing he can barely manage
And he's way past starvin
He's really famished
His right-hand man is up north, that's hurtin em
His cellphone bout to cut off, Sprint jerkin em
And his baby moms startin to do her thing again
She left him for a nigga pumpin e up in Binghamton
If his money is right than maybe he can diss her
But he can't, and niggas is breakin his little sister
His pops just passed
His mom use to be an occasional sniffer
Then she started fuckin with the gas
Dude use to be a star back then
He had the Benz CL something
But he just turned his car back in
Mad carets pawned all his rings
Took this thing next thing I know
Money pawned all his bling
Now he just like everybody
With the same old plans
That can't get over the hump
With the same old grams
They was on the block making fun of him
He slid off came back with his hammer and killed everyone of em

[Hook]
Cause when I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe

On D I go man to man
I know niggas with an asshole
Full of parole that go hand in hand
Fuck hot thats humidity
And you can't mix money with stupidity
Even though I get my coke from Columbia
My cars from Germany
And my guns from Sicily
Nothin personal but I was raised different
Hold my joint sideways so I blaze different
Give it to anybody fuck an age difference
From those in the world to those in the cage riffing
Rub the kite on your chest and swallow the stamp
At the end of the day they still gonna follow the champ
It ain't about being lyrical
Cause when I get in the booth
I make miracles and I ain't stared at you
But I'm in tune with the hood so I'm better than you
And when you see me comin you know what is better to do

[Hook]

[Jadakiss]
Can't lie all I got is my balls and my vocals
And the only security I roll wit is my social
It don't look decent
It's like niggas left they crew in the hood
And went on the road with the precinct
Had it up to here with this fake shit
They don't even want a nigga to earn his
Just give and take shit
Just make sure you mention my name in da top brackets
And make sure you mention your name as the top faggot
Trust me this go around I will not have it
I putting niggas heads to bed like Craftmatics
How you think your man died
More money than respect
And it wasn't close it was by a landslide
Listen my nigga your work is sloppy
And I don't love them hoes but the purple got me
If I don't don't do it with music I'mma do it wit poppy
Just play the sideline and observe and watch me
Let's go

[Hook][Hook - T.L. Cross]
One thing y'all know about me
I don't play, so just beware
You catch me up in V.I.P
Up in the club, that's my atmosphere
Because I got money to spend -- I keep getting it in
From the hood, so I don't play fair
And I'mma keep living it up, keep getting it up
Keep throwing it up until it all falls down

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Break the P's down to onions, money in abundance
I'm in the lower millions, I'm trying to get in the hundreds
Niggas' pants too tight to fight, so they don't want it
You pay for somebody to protect you, so where your gun at?
Been there, done that; seen the coke come back
Seen niggas come home from jail, then run back
Singing the same sad song, my nigga -- one that
Negative energy stick to him like a thumbtack
Real hustler, probably sold a million and one packs
Niggas think they smart and nice, but they dumb wack
It's only 'til you crack they skull, give them a mum' wrap
When it's cold, I reside wherever the sun's at
Son's back, what?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Top of the league, 3-piece suit or fatigues
All I got to do is look a certain way and you'll bleed
4 words describe me: "Niggas can't fuck around"
Fish scale verses: prices go up and down
Put it out there, see if it taste right
Young Jewish bulldog keeping the case right
Apartment on the 4th floor, keeping the base right
Jacksons and Benjamins keeping the safe right
First and the 15th is when we break nights
Bunch of red beams on your head like brake lights
Bitches that fucked everybody turned into fake dykes
Was biting the whole day -- it's gonna be a great night

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Dice hitting the wall, decks getting shuffled
Nines getting wiped down, Tecs getting muffled
Perico in the plastic stacks in the duffel
Niggas coming through getting racks on the muscle
You asked me for money, I ain't ask you to hustle
The industry is hurt, they looking for the next Russell
The hip-hop cops outside waiting to cuff you
The Bloods is on Rikers Island waiting to cut you
Niggas on the outside just want to abduct you
Dudes turned they back on you that you look up to
Keep throwing mine in the air, I got enough to
And I don't like spending my money, nigga...I love to[Hook: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix everybody's hands go up
And they stay there
And they stay yea
And they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Verse 1: DJ Khaled]
Sittin' on the top floor, what you think I'm hot for
Every summer drop more, hits to make my stock go, up
Them hands go, up; them fans go, up
I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma, stay there
We the best of the best, grind while you haters just sleep
I'm yellin' "free Weezy", I rep the heart of the streets
Who hotter than me, I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist, wake up every morning just to count white faces
Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus
Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't [motherfuck ?] nobody better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what!)
(Kill 'em!)
Ok, let's shine my friend
Get up on my grind again
Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Diddy]
Her heart racing like she snort cocaine
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
Got the most paper Mr. New York Times
I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines
Everybody getting money but I cop the first six
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest
Lean back you and your crew, Fat Joe, T-S
Yea it's Young Funeral, all black on me
So act like summers over and fall back homey
Winnin' is all I do, I'll answer all of you
But y'all ain't sayin' shit, like prank callers do

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Jadakiss]
It's already proven, I got them birds movin'
All I do is win, I'm allergic to losin'
Yellow gold cuban, nine mil Ruger
I'll show you what to do with em
Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em
They don't want no problems, they might end up suing em
Disassociate yourself, have nothing to do with em
We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em

[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
Just blew trial, crack lobsters Little Italy
Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I’m a rude boy
You just hit the Power Ball, everyday a new toy
Nigga it’s a stick up, a motherfuckin' robbery
I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me
Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me

[Hook][Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm come from a small town where organized crime is the rule
You kill niggas without permission, niggas gon' kill you
We bang the rags too, red and blue
This shit ain't out only there on the west side fool
Surrounded by section eight houses in the projects
A place where you make the wrong turn, you get robbed next
We all targets, standin' out on the street corner
That's why you see the lil' kids with the heat on 'em
Police pull out, hop out but they can't catch us
They never even get a chance to say "Drop your weapons"
Liquor stores never close, the whole hood high
Niggas know when it's war the whole hood ride
We on that Bishop in Juice shit
I put this fo'-five in yo' mouth like a toothpick, you bitch
The south ain't safe no mo' so get a gun
And pray to God you make it to see twenty-one
You gon' make me crawl through your backyard and cut off your light switch
Kick in your back door and take all that white shit
Niggas know what to do when I'm around
Go put your pack up and pick up your fo' pound

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
It's just another day at the coffee shop
We sellin everything, down to the shoes and watch
And for the right price meet me in the parking lot
I got a sale on them old school Chevy drops
No knock cause we only serve the best
Oh yeah my coffee shop is cheaper than the rest~!
I'm takin orders, tell me who's next
Only cash, no credit, no checks
When your car stop, welcome to Starblocks
You wanna triple your knot? Invest in our stock
And now we doin numbers, just like the close-out
Make sure to shop with me, before it's sold out
Everybody on the block know my nickname
Grade A pimp game, you can call me Ben Frank
And all my money get counted when the shifts change
Then get 211 t-shirt wit'cho picture framed

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Ayo the dopes and the rice, the cokes and the pyrex
Over the stove and I'm bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
Ain't no more fair ones, now niggas'll jump your moms
The god, minus the 12 disciples
I pop up, all you see is shells and rifles
If I don't like you, I'mma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon' follow me now
Down eighth and an oozie mahogany brown
Faggots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they ain't got no money to get buried
You could flip, I'll survive m'kay, motherfucker
In my block still doin twenty-five a day
Know you work out, chest and your back all nice
But the twelve gauge'll have your six pack on ice, what
Sinnin or not, I'm grinnin a lot, spendin a knot
Dirty denim and a cinnamon fox
Bitches'll follow, gangsters'll ride, gentlemen watch
Buy the bar, leave drunk, shoot up the block

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear[Intro: Jadakiss]
I don't even do 24's, haha
I'm only doing this for you Poobs
They said I sound good on these down south beats
I've never seen you smile (Hue-HA)
Kiss my ass nigga

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I'm a D-Block general, I be bringing paper in
Caught a bad deal in the beginning, now I'm raping them
Poked the Chevy out for the summer on 28's again
What is he drinking, what is he smoking, how he making them
How's he been nice for so long, why they hating him
Got him doing time, in the box, isolating him
Got money, and he love pressure, they ain't braking him
Tight shirts, tight pants, all these homo-sapiens
All these niggas is trash, and they over rating them
Put 'em in the booth with me, I'm annihilating them
Who ever you think is pumped up, I'm inflating them
Jail niggas, niggas in the hood, I relate to them
Blood money, and drug money, I was caking 'em
There when they broke the pies down, they was baking them
My enemies, I wish them all luck, and I pray for them
Cause when ever we cross paths, that'll be the day for them
Thompson's, M16's and AK's for them
Can just get one, bullets like Frito Lay for them
Close casket, leave nothing but legs for them
Fuck mercy, no need to beg for them
Yea, just let the Devil deal with 'em
Uh, and the other niggas that squeal with them
Fuck boys, do fuck shit
I wasn't before, and I'm still not to be fucked with
What!Uh collision, I'm a problem
And nobody can solve em, I'm long division
On the road of success but it's more of a mission
They said I would be dead or I was goin to prison
No one of them is certain but the other one isn't
Made rare decisions, rock diamonds that impared your vision
Even supplied ya'll for years with listen
Like I'm just starting but I got years of wisdom
Stripes I got nigga, it took years to get em
Whenever you see him notice his same peers is with him
He destroys tracks the minute he hears the rhythm
Not only a hell of a flow but his ears forbidden
And if you think this is a ring tone, yea you kiddin
Fifty thousand records sold, right yea you kiddin
It was his time to go he ain't care who did em
Didn't appreciate life and got aired for lying
PCP by the liter, good sheba
Sergios tech sweat suits, good Addidas
The jewels is invincible that we was suppose to get from them
Use to send them to the store, now we blowin piff with them
Nowa days it's different, I was fortunate
Cause I did alot of listening, the new era is missin it
Everybody three fifty seven and four fif'n it
Drug program two to four, three to six'n it
Feds send niggas way out by lake Michigan
Put the coke in the tires only if they Michelin
Never talk on the fone only deal with official men
You don't even know homie that put you in the shit you in
Gotta busy schedule and I don't think I can fit you in
What's good for me ain't good for them
No matter what set you claim or what hood you in
I hit you and I find you a wood box for them to put you in
Stay away from the people that act scary
The Maserati Gran Turismo is black cherry
People that control the world from black berries
But you will never know cus they keepin the facts buried
Before I had a deal I was movin them packs freely
Made a couple million of of rap & then I got greedy
Competition got so garbage it got easy
Then the internet kilt the game and it got greezy
Download upload before the dutch rolled
Not only that all the rappers got went into suck mode
Soon as the plague is done with, you know son spit
Let you get ya mind right, bypass the dumb shit
Before I hop in the league, you gotta pop it and leave
This is somethin you can pop in and leave
And I Know it's theraputic but be careful how you use it
Cause the flow might make your ear drums pop and then bleed[Mary J. Blige w/ Soul II Soul in background]
Steady are you ready? (are you ready?)
What's goin on? (whats goin on?)

The coupe got 19's, the chain's got nice gleam
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
Your ass is fat, your frame is little
Got the door knockers on with your name in the middle
On the dance floor gettin it in with me
Might let you and your friend hit me
Soon as the wind hit me
I live dare, legendary the top of the globe
So there is no more room for anything more
And I state my name, my names to claim
Jadakiss I done came here and changed the game
Now we at the point where your birthdays is costly

“You all a bunch of fucking assholes
You know why? You don’t have the guts to be who you wanna be
You need people like me
You need people like me so you can point your fucking fingers and say
"That's the bad guy"

You just know how to hide, how to lie
Me, I don’t have that problem”

Besides walkin' 'round here shooky, you straight lane
Good dope got fiends lookin' for straight veins
The fire in my eye, you lookin' at straight flames
What you feelin' is that guilt, it ain't shame
Servin' niggas just ain't built to take pain
It take a certain special skill to bang, bang
Yeah, I could stand there and just look at your brains hang
We're from a different world, my nigga, the Dwayne Wayne
We in the same race, not in the same lane
It's all the same base, was hoppin' the same train
Used the same plates for choppin' the same 'caine
Yeah, no security, I'm poppin' the thang-thang
When are you gonna realize he's not playin'?
With extortion, dudes got killed, they stopped payin'
Stay low-key firin', don't stop sprayin'

Or else they gon' hit him soon as I okay him
Yeah, I'm still killin' these bitches, I O. J. 'em

We don't love them hoes, we Bombay 'em
Show me the target, set it, I'm aimin'
Whatever the odds are, bet it, I'm gamin'

Shawty look at my Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Bentley, Benz or Beamer
The four door or the two seater
She’s all on me with no breather
My cologne's exotic reefer
And the chrome wheel is my sneakers
750 full body clap a plastic ke-ke-keep her
This is ether the brand new speaker
My girls a diva, me and lisa, Rosé and Keisha
Lets take things deeper, peddle pusher
Tire screaching you can’t ask girl to freeze her
He’s a pinky ring from freezing
And a hundred dollar season
New GT, millimeter. Get too close you’ll get my fever
Throw throw throw up as I roll up
Windows rolled up blowing reefer
Don’t compare me to no jacker I originate the flow
The flow is so unusual, nothing you have seen before

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Get in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley
My pockets never empty
I got dead animals on and every dead president with me
But I’m all about them Benjamins
All about them C-notes
Suck it til it’s dry, my pockets' got a deep throat
Always was a hustler, never was a fool
Always go that work but I never finished school
Honor roll lifestyle, nigga get your grades up
Highest in my class because I stayed down and blazed up
Graduated from the thousands to the milli’s
We drinking Conjure we graduated from the Henny
And now I got my night cap driving with my night shades
Call me a jerk but I ain't going through that tight phase
Clothes still baggy enough to let my nuts hang
Ludacris, I’m built Ford tough like a mustang
DTP I got my whole crew with me
Pull up on your bitch look her in the eye and then I say get in my...

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]

[Verse 3: The Dream]
Look at what I’m driving
Shorty you should be beside me
I’m gonna be your provider
I heard you a rider
Like a pony!
Tell me what you gon' do
Tell me what you want, boo
Hit the car lot, buy what we want to
Lloyd want to know what kind of car you choose
And after that I’mma drop a stack on them shoes

You know I keep the choppers in the cellar
There’s nothing you can tell us
If it ain the M its the GT or the CLS
You ain't got to see us, if we there you can inhale us
You either or niggas
You either broke or either jealous
Been a problem since niggas is rocking perry ellis
They really just don’t like us cause they wifeys wanna nail us
Just like we from Portland cause we blazing in their trailers
So we sharper than propellers
We sparking them vanillas
The Larkins and Barrettas, the narks is tryna get us
But we only getting chedder so we down for the whatever
The grass is even greener, the water’s even wetter
Maybach flying spur, new 7 even better

Back in '03 getting head behind ten
Club parking lot I never want this night to end
Mr. Cocaine got it, all I do is set trends
White on white Lambo with the fishscale fins
Yankee blue top, Yankee blue fitted
D on my block like I’m from New York city
If it ain't a Bentely it’s a beamer
Keep a chopper or a Nina
Keep a cutlass up a Chevy
Trunk sound like a arena
If it’s g-unit and it’s thug gang and Mr. Coca-ina
All the cars foreign cause they Bentley, Benz or Beamers

[Outro: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Bent, bent, be, Bently
