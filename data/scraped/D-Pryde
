[Hook: Futuristic]
You ain't never met another nigga like me (sheesh)
Even if I die, you can't forget about me (sheesh)
Everything that I do is OD (sheesh)
I said, you ain't never met a nigga like me, no
My whip is OD, my chick is OD, too much
My fit is so clean, my kicks OD, too much
I spit it OD, my shit is OD, too much
Futuristic OD, I'm 'bout to OD

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, I OD like I'm ODB
I ain't passing the rock you on Kobe's team
Flow cold like your leg in the winter in Illinois
If you walking around with a hole in jeans
I hope to be the nigga that's known as "sheesh"
If it's a part five I'll get a hole in three
Two hands, double fist when I hold my drink
One styrofoam cup’ll make you show the lean
It’s only me
Labels I demand to speak
So don’t come at that man if your plan is weak
Instagram going up a thousand fans a week
Don't need a hand, I need some cash you can hand to me
If you ain't with it, you cut off, amputee
Kicking back, taking shots like a damn marine
I'm Dan Marino mixed with Al Pacino at the casino cause I'm all about my chips, and command the team, whoa

[Bridge: Futuristic]
They say I do too much
But I got a lot more coming
She say I'm in too deep
Oh hold on, that ho coming
They say that there's no way
I did it all without no budget
I say I'm way too high
If I ever come down
Imma hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Hit the ground running

[Hook: Futuristic]
You ain't never met another nigga like me (sheesh)
Even if I die, you can't forget about me (sheesh)
Everything that I do is OD (sheesh)
I said, you ain't never met a nigga like me, no
My whip is OD, my chick is OD, too much
My fit is so clean, my kicks OD, too much
I spit it OD, my shit is OD, too much
Futuristic OD, I'm 'bout to OD

[Verse 2: Pryde]
Yeah, uh, sick!
New women in my new phone
Who's home, it's a new number uno
You know, still swerving in the two door
Pimping, if we talking 'bout eyes, I can do this shit with two closed
I'm too OD, bitch, yeah, you know it's D, bitch
The letter after A, B, C, bitch
You know I ain't never been a bird brain
Y'all dudes mermaids, cause I can see, bitch
30K off shirts (that's easy)
Buy merch make merch (that's easy)
Used to cry over bitches swear a motherfucker know his worth
Yeah, I got some homies and the boys did dirt
But I ain't from the streets, I ain't moving that work
But you know I'm dressing like a dealer
Cause I got some money got it coming
Been eating so good that my top's so muffin
It's okay, I ain't fit like
Chubby boy got a fit wife and she thick, Christ
I get hyped on this shit right, it's the real me no disguise
Now I don't gotta diss guys I don't care what you're doing
I be here for the money, I be here for the music
It's that Brampton boy and they know the coast
And it's Richvale 'til I overdose
Bitch, I'm gone

[Hook: Futuristic & Pryde]
You ain't never met another nigga like me (sheesh)
Even if I die, you can't forget about me (sheesh)
Everything that I do is OD (sheesh)
I said, you ain't never met a nigga like me, no
My shit is OD, my bitch is OD
My fit is OD, your shit is '03
No whip, I'm low-key
But I'm still OD
I'm OD, OD, baby
Come and blow me slowly, Richvale[Intro]
Yea
Real shit, real

[Verse 1]
Uh, small town kid with the biggest dreams
On a another level while these bitches playing little league
Tity boi mindset, you know we think it differently
Did this from the bedroom to the industry
I was stayin up all night cookin, now the woman with me all pornstar lookin, they just talk under their breath cause I know y'all pussy, we just play it like the pros cause I know y'all rookies
Added more shit onto my checklist, up all night until Mcdonalds serving breakfast, couple years ago I really never would of guessed it, I be tearing all this shit up now your boys up next biiitch
Ain't gotta sugar coat this ambition, still focused we ain't never had a plan missing, told wifey I'ma make it to the top, baby wait until I drop, you 'gon really see your man [?]

[Pre-Hook]
I got all my dogs with me
Came up with my gs
Day one, all these broads on me
And they be loving my team
Day one, got my city with me
Been reppin here for my streets
Day one, baby follow my lead
My crew heavy, we deep

[Hook]
Day One
Still with my, with my, day ones
Been down, been down, since day one
Still with my, with my, day ones
Been down, been down, since day one
Still with my, with my, day ones
Been down, been down, since day one
Still with my, with my, day ones
Been down, been down, since

[Verse 2]
Same block boy on the same shit
Same squad still tryna have the game lit
City love me but some other locals hate it
They just type it they don't say it to my face on some fake shit
Baby you know how my life go, brought my city to the world all on my own, 40 ounces, cheap cigs with some tight hoes, whole squad steezin, bitch pleasin with some tight clothes, we got everything they need, squad way high, we don't even got the weed lit, they be stickin to the crew, adhesive, we just give it to the city when they need it, don't slip, don't trip, we the new stuff

[Outro - DJ Press Play]
Eh yo wait, holdup holdup holdup
It's your boy DJ Press Play, once again
First of all, shut the fuck up, and that's on God, okay?
Ice coffee in hand, you hear that?
Hide your kids, hide your wife, hide your turkeys, hide the whole damn crew, and your damn furniture
Richvale Summer
Eh yo Pryde, let me let Vatty tell you whats up[Verse 1]
Real shit real...
Oh my holy moly, people act like my homies when they want some kind of benefit, just so they could live better
I'm sorry I can't trust you, I say both thank you and fuck you, oh man I dun had enough
And ever since I came up in this motherfucker I've been really hated
I'm human, I get bothered by everything that they saying
Some people getting angry and killing my reputation
But you gon' learn later I'm everything that they ain't
And I do this for the crew, I ain't care how much it cost me
Get some flashy ladies and throw us a private party
Cause I'mma be the greatest, I'm confident you'll be sorry, just tell me what you want, what you really, really want

[Pre-Hook]
I got what you need, keep that on the low
She popped it off for me because I'm doin' the most
Do it all for the team, whole team 'bout to blow
She said boy I love ya', I said it's good, now I know

[Hook]
And I fuck with you low key, low key
I fuck with you low key (x6)

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel like I'm off of some powder
I'm working hard every hour, new born gift just like baby showers
They in love with the set, you could do this all on your own
But its better when you got good friends. (Yea)
It took me mad long, but now I'm feeling joy
I used to be some kid but now I'm that boy
They hate my whole swagger, they hate my damn voice
I made a big change like George on mad coins
Oh you ain't really lyrical, we wish you were more spiritual
If we get a better song from you, it would be a miracle (Fuck You)
I'll still be the greatest, I'm confident you'll be sorry
Just tell me what you want, what you really, really want

[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, just trynna keep it on the low, the low
Oh, just trynna keep it on the low, the low

[Hook]

[Outro]
Jheez Out Here[Intro]
How lit do you want to get form a scale of one to ten right now?
Lit
Super fucking lit

[Verse 1]
Lit
I think she want to get drunk and get high she just told me to send the address
I know she know she just told me she came through to chill and relieve all the stress
She know who she fucking with, it's a dream team, you know we the best
Don't expect anything less, came from the bottom, oh yeah we feel blessed
Baby ain't gotta hide it all, I know just where you wanna be
Can even come front about it, i know you fucking with me
The liquor bottles and the champagne, girl all this shit is for free
When your fucking with me baby

[Hook]
I think you wanna, get lit with us, hit the strip with us, hop up in a whip with us
I think you wanna, get lit with us, bring the chicks with us, downtown do shit with us
Get lit with us, get lit, (Lit!) (x4)

[Verse 2]
I think she's here for the party
Here for the night, she'll here for tomorrow
Baby girl you can't outsmart me
You want to come hang let me open the car door
Let me just crack up a 40 and pop up some bubbly and bust up the merlot
Excuse the attire, my outfit all black, girl im just in my work clothes
I heard you work round the town, baby I work round a bunch of them
Got a bunch of soldiers here, not in their older years, and I just don't give a fuck with them
A lot of people ask me what I do, man its never upfront, finessing the plug
When you come ask me what is that I do, I tell you im doing whatever I want
These fuck boys want to talk about me but that gossip talk is all women's work
If ya'll ask me how I got on top, I say never go in putting women first
Same go for them real bitches, dudes nowadays really look to hurting
These fellas talk like i'm hella soft but I buck back if they busting first and thats real
But I ain't the fight type, im the bitch connoisseur, im the dude who wants more, im the stay up all night type
Fuck violence, that dont get womens attention, im "?", i'm flexing, flick wrist, i'm finessing, I ride for my dogs
And that shit is embedded, I know the whole place getting lit when we step in and im gone

[Hook][Verse 1 - Dannie Riel]
I never fucked Tim, I never fuck Pryde
Said that shit like enough times, but if I did they'd swim up in it like Michael Phelps, muff-dive
These bitches going through tough times
Worried about my cup size, don't focus on my butt fine
Still feeding bitches like lunch time
I don't give a fuck about all these bottles, being surrounded by all these models
Got your favourite man on my follow list, basic bitches come swallow this
Sixty-nine and you hold the waist, let them have that Riel-taste
In his mouth up in the morning, pussy in the mouth, toothpaste
All these hoes so two-faced, I don't even act too phased
Give me top like toothpaste
Whip me around with like two chains, not a rapper like 2 Chainz
But you still love them titties boy
In your city don't get annoyed
If it's bitch versus bitch you'll get destroyed
I see you talking with all that noise in my comment section, but face to face man it's all affection
Let 'em know I never needed that false attention
Lip ring and them D's bitch, get down on them knees bitch
Everything on fleek bitch, you said shes better?
Please bitch

[Hook - Andrew Garcia]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2 - Traphik]
(Yea!) I never fucked Dannie, but y'all think I did
Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you kids
I should hit it once, make a vid, upload the clip and get a billion hits
I spit the realest shit, that's guy code, from the gecko, that's Geico
Got her wide open like a Gyno and she never let her guy know
Just playin', I got a girl and her name ch-ch-ch-Chia
(Aye!) We fly to Mexico sip margaritas (Sip margaritas!)
This love is so cheesy we call that quesadillas
We movin' in silence like I got a Prius, we duckin' the cameras you can't even see us like woo
I'm like Marky Mark in that Calvin Klein, your boy so fine that I'm getting fined
I wink an eye and your bitch is mine
When I spit my rhyme you gotta hit rewind cause most of the time y'all don't even get my lines
When I hit the club, I don't get in line, you try that shit and you gon' get declined motherfucker
Hate me or love me, you know that you need me
They didn't believe me, but now I'm on TV
I am unstoppable walking on coals
No time for the comments, I'm blocking the trolls
No time for no talking, I put you on hold
These kids see my life and they all be like goals

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - D-Pryde]
(I don't even do these anymore, alright check it out though, goes like this)
Richvale Gang
I never fucked Dannie and that's real shit
And we just buddies but I'd still hit
If you still hate me after all these years, then that's a self problem you gotta deal with
I stunt alone, and I just decided too you can call me D or just Mr. Pryde too
Dudes talk like they chick made, but the shit I preach makes the bitch inside you boy
Look I've been through shit that you never would see, know that I'm clever I still get to sever the heads of whoever so effortlessly
I know you say that you better, but trust me I'm better than better could ever just be
I wrote your girlfriend a nice letter, but trust me she said the letter she wants is D, please
I know that the public thinks I'm super young, but it's cool
But I don't do things that these stupid teen youngins do
If they said they getting money then show me some fucking proof
If you lookin' just like Dannie then trust me I'm fucking you-ou
Please don't stray from these things I say
I show the dick, you control the dick, but first I got to say s'il vous plait
I got people that's with me that worked since the start
Lions and tigers and bears and I swear that you squares wouldn't tear me apart
Don't care if it's light out I don't care if it's dark, bitch
I'm still up and you still suck (?)
When it comes to fucks, I can't give none shoutout to Tim, Drew, and my baby Dannie, and last shout to my real ones

[Hook][Intro]
Wait Wait Wait, I'll tell you when to go
Alright and go

[Verse]
Ooo I would like to wake up next to you
Toss and turn to the smell of your perfume
From last night, I don't know what else to do
When your laying with me, baby it's simply amazing                     When I wake up next to you
Fingers running through your skin so fucking smooth
Sun beaming while we're cooped up in your room
Watching you laying naked, baby it's simply amazing
I'm fucking selfish, I'm way too clingy
You talk you know me, acting like you miss me
Know you stayed the night and you might leave in the morning
But I can handle you going because I really like to wake up next to you
Toss and turn to the smell of your perfume
From last night, I don't know what else to do
When your laying with me, baby it's simply amazing
When I wake up next to you
Fingers running through your skin so fucking smooth
Sun beaming while we're cooped up in your room
Watching you laying naked, baby your simply amazing
Ooh yea
Ooh
Waking next to you

[Outro]
Thank you Based God[Verse 1]
I've been on two since you left me
Spend my summer leaning on these hoes
And you've been on the same shit since you left me
You don't really miss me I suppose
I've been drinking more than you'd imagine
You would think i'd really have no time
But shit is really stressing me, it's saddening
I lie to you and I say that i'm fine

[Chorus]
But really I be up all night, up all night
I'll be going hard when im alone
But baby I be up all night, up all night
Fuck you if you leave me on my phone
Cause when im, im, im fucked up, im thinking about you
And when im, im, im fucked up, im thinking about you (x3)

[Verse 2]
I've been on my couch for like an hour
Fixing every drink to pass the time
Fucking this whole night up with my soldiers
Dressing like we just committed crimes
This smoke I chief is fucking up my lungs now
I live it up and puff it like it's night
Everybody says that I should quit soon
I tell them it's okay, I plan to stop

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I finished the bottle, I finished the bottle, I finished the bottle
See I finished the bottle, I finished the bottle

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Richvale Summer now

It's that Richvale Summer bitch
The crew ain't even give a fuck (x8)This isn't real to you is it
On the roster of Lolla they couldn't say I ain't did it
Pointing out blindness facts about how i haven't been killin it
All because I let go of an image that wasn't real to me
Always had motivation, every cheque might be my last paper
Tell them bitches I got a deal off a flash player
Ain't even got a blue check up on my twitter page
But I could pull as much views as major artists do in a day
How did it feel when you saw that blast on those websites
Got a masters and publishing deal and I got my set right
I know I shouldn't be bragging but this one is for my haters
Once you saw I signed to BMG I wonder how it felt like
What
2 mixtapes gold on the net
Now these artists try to mimic the formula that I used
But I made a cult of kids that were waiting hard for an idol
Bitch I taught you indie labels that this was just more than views
Uh
My skin tone has probably been a weakness
But bitch sit down for this prophecy I'll be preaching
Trigonometry hasn't gotten relatable to my being
Cause i never had a co-sign, I made it here with dope rhymes
I made it here by who I know, higher than a doobie roll
Tryna play with millions when I used to play with Yu-Gi-Oh
Haven't been home in so long, but still my city go strong
TORONTO, the underrated town you SHOULD take notes on
Ho
10K was made a month
And I'm a little Asian dork with no radio buzz
I don't have anything else that I could say to you punks
But get your head up in the game, get your fellatio up
PAUSE
You can laugh and say my style is PG bound
But say it to my face, because all I'm hearing is me-ows
Pussy-ass artists who sat and stayed there in denial-
Are the same assholes I look at and-say look at me-now
Major labels they slept, sat and worried bout debt-
It isn't bout the spot I'm in, it's about the spot that I'll get
And you tell me that he's better, you tell me that he's a threat
Then that's cool, but I got a sniper, I'm aiming right at his head
POP
This one for Stai, Phil, Den-Z and J
James Arcara and Niel, I do this all for my people
Mad Ryan and Rik, Josa, AZ, and Gnyus
We built this team from the ground up, a business-raised fetus
I'm here
Looks like the kid is well on his peak
Mad speculation to how much I'mma sell in a week
But I'm fine, I know the hearts of my competitors beat
But I show no heart, my ish sound acapella to me
I'm being real
I don't got to buy a table at the club
Or tell you that I'm on the guest-list
All that ish is petty, when it all falls down, it's numbers, money and music
And the only phrase I'm going by now, is "Get Rich"
You wanna talk about the fact you hit my wife first?
But you worked for that ass boy, that ish to me was light work
So while you at your crib tryna text her and tryna write her
She ain't answering cause she's with me, enjoying better scenery
Some people act like I don't hustle and breath this
Some of you see my ass as the second coming of Jesus
Well, my third time's comin', you see how I kill a remix
You think all this ish is dope? You'll see how crazy my EP is
PrizzyYou ducks off, I'm gritty
I bust off to titties
You want songs is pretty
Well fuck off, I'm busy
See my apparel, I bet you say I'm your hero
But you know I got Heat like Pacino and Rob DeNiro
Blazing and shaking places
Hated, I'm so impatient
Its hell I seem to be raisin'
So call me the Asian Satan
Play it, I plan relaxing
I heard you called the ambulance
Because I just showed you bitches discipline like you be Janet Jackson
After smackin' all you little actors actin'
I traveled back to a time when rap actually had a passion
Cause now a days you stupid rappers are just bitin shit
And some of you dumb fucks don't know what a cypher is
So I decypher the cypher and kill it nice
To the spoons I am knife
And to pussy I am a tiger biter
I spit it awesome on you bitches on and off and
My flow can make Stephen Hawking be able to walk and talk again
I bomb right bars, my songs quite far
To make you do anything for me, like a Klondike bar
You missed the plan, and if you fuckers try to diss me
Man, you can get fucked by a horse like Mr. Hands
Getting more paper, I'm Heclore Major
I'll kill your family, your set, and your next door neighbor, hater
It's Pryde bitches, every bar I spit's a live sentence
And I ripped you pussys with something I wrote in five minutes[Verse: D-Pryde]

YeAH!
I wish a motha'fucka would
'cuz they won't really know the outcome
Forbes list or die
I put that on the chick that I came out of
And I be LIVE, killin' em
High and fly in this
I can't work a 9-5, I want 5-9 Million
(Fresh and lucky?) to get this
Hella love in this business
Bummin' through this royal shit
I'm a peasant fucking a Princess
No Alicia, they fallin', no Phil, but they callin'
I don't understand why these rude ass rappers get melancholy
On me, the flyest even when I'm wearing Crocs
I don't see the feet like you wearin' socks
Trying to make more money than your parents got
All you rappers do is copy like when parrots talk
Fuck all the bickering on who's the best
You know who's stupid fresh
Me and this whole rap game be some newly weds
Givin' up on views, improving myself
My ex-chick called me a "jerk-off", now I'm doing myself
Yeah, buddy got flame
And I'm lovin' this game
Catch me in the main city with a Honey Cocaine
A Honey Cocaine herself
That's my trill(?) bitch
I always seen her as somebody I could build with
Tell 'em that my Brampton bellboys are in the building
My family still struggling, I'm just ready to kill shit
Yeah, I'm jumpin' at 'em with skill
Every trip my mom takes to the hospital for chemo, is another rapper I kill
Angrier than ever, but the angrier the better
Bitch, I'm cold to be around, please pack another sweater
This for Debbie, I swear I hate seeing you hurt
Shit, I've been through the worst, Everything is gonna work
Losing your husband isn't easy, and I've lost a best friend
And everything isn't gonna be as right as back then
"It's all good," "move on," "grow up,"
That's what they tell me, I can never get into what they sellin'
You know I see the comments like
"I want the old Pryde," "this is shit to me,"
Bitch, I was 15, I'm 20 now, stop bickering
Fuck the expectation, fuck all the speculation
And the fact that I don't deserve all the pain that my family's facing
Brother is working a job, and it's hurting me hard
'cuz I'm making him proud, but I'm supposed to be famous by now
I hate it, I'm trying to celebrate
Whole team depressed, we trying to levitate
And when I make make mad millions, I'mma L.M.A...
O. (Owe) it all to haters who told me I would never make it
Look, 2 Decades, four years in this, I hope you hearing this, Dad
You ain't gotta hurt no more, I'mma work
I'mma slave myself, and kill my own health
Until I get filthy rich and you won't have to work no more
Instead of going strip clubs, dollar bills, ain't (?) here with my main clique
One day, I'mma walk into this bitch and make it rain quick
Man, I can't be wifed up, I ain't got my shit together
If I do that shit now, I'm only doing it for pleasure
Bucking shots at everybody on my target list
Why? 'cuz they gotta know that I worked hard for this
Gotta work this year, we've been through enough though
And I'm about to make this year
The Year of The Russell
2 Decades[Verse 1: The Flan]
Yeah, no time for loss, a serious game
I snap, crackle and pop, boy, you hearing these flames?
It’s too many trynna be different, yet appearing the same
I shifted the stick, I guess that means I’m gearing for change
Ahead of the pack, these rappers know I’m better than that
Nobody really wants you like the slice of bread in the back
That claim to be hot, I’m asking where the evidence at
But you probably just got it twisted like the medicine cap
Okay, bird’s eye view, I probably just keep on dropping shit
Up a bunk bed, my goal is to stay on top of shit
You're not in conversation, I basically make the topic switch
All I want are dogs, lots of ‘em, that’s word to Papa [?]
‘Cause I’m at the top of the chain
Ironically you the pendant, and at the bottom you hang
Like constipation, ain’t shit coming, wallow in shame
The bandwagon’s leaving, it’s cool though, you could follow the train
I’m out

[Verse 2: Vanhill]
If I hear one more time that these niggas say they're next
I’mma act like a vampire
Niggas walk around campfires telling stories to each other
Thinking that it’s scary as fuck
Smoking on Christmas trees everyday so we’re merry as fuck
Let him play his shit, tell him to his face that he sucks
I’m as blunt as the shit that Wiz don’t smoke
Pass it to the kids, hope those kids don’t choke
I’m as wavy as the Titanic, now let that sink in (ha, yeah)
I’m as wavy as the Titanic, now let that sink inside the ocean
Fuck these niggas, fuck these bitches, ‘cause you never really know the motive
I got bars like Motorolas, milking every situation into frozen yogurt
Momma told me if the rules ain’t bent, don’t bend ‘em
Let them know that it’s time to go to yoga, man I feel like Yoda
Trade the lightsaber for a soda, that’s just me being a nigga
I’m sorry for me being niggerish, but really I just wanna be nigga rich
Niggas act like bitches, bitches act like niggas, so it’s hard to tell the differences
I’m a rapper, I just wanna be a simple kid
Man, I’m just swagging on this beat
Swaggy P with the shot, point four on the clock

[Verse 3: Pryde]
Real shit, real
I made five figures off a fucking shirt
Moral of the story, know your fucking worth
I’m the wasteman captain to beat the boy’s time
Only rapper you know that ain’t got a cosign
And I ain’t pushed a brick before, never was I dealing weight
If I’m pushing bricks I swear that shit is gon’ be real estate
All I do is invest, bitches don’t show interest
‘Cause I ain’t got no big Benz, it’s cool, I’m making racks though
Still her MCM without no abs though
Leaping like the last stage of tadpole, I’m past go
Phone-E on the track, got me repping for the Bramp’ though
I don’t rep the Dot, but Toronto’s still my fam though, asshole
Light work, every verse is easy done
My crew doing two XL, your crew doing smedium
Phone-E hold the burner, let it pop at the fakers
Ain’t got the trey pound, but stay down, this shot’s for the haters

[Verse 4: Ricky Rain]
Okay, I know you don’t like me
I’m more likely to be more liked than you
Don’t lie, it’s true and to me you are lion’s food
Close your eyes, I’m about to shed this light on you
For the money I’ll just probably put this knife in you
Drain the life from you, or would you like me to
Ignite the fire and light you, good night you too
I’m just saying a lot of crazy shit that I’ve been through
I’m in tuned and I’ve been told the flow is cold
Your flow is wack, your flow is bog’, I told you that
The Rain is here, the Rain is back
Anybody in the motherfucking game get slapped
And I could probably pull your dame with no strings attached
And I just came attached with that Mac-11
And when I aim this strap and I crack the weapon
Your whole brain goes splat, if I ever feel threatened
I’m like

[Verse 5: Devon Tracy]
Your girl gets stretched fast like she’s late for yoga
Tings everywhere, I ain’t talking Jamaican soda
Feds pull us over, try to make their quotas
Little do they know their sons and their daughters quote us
Oh shit, flow lit, glow sticks
Couldn’t miss the fam even if you was homesick
Fasten your seatbelts ‘cause I brought the whole clique
Young niggas, we takin’ over the whole 6
Woah, I ain’t never met a cool hater
Way up, I blow O’s size of moon craters
Boy, I got more lines than some school paper
Never got my degree but I’m too major
Man, this summer I’mma snap like photo clicks
All this bread around me like a Pogo stick
Gon' turn me to a mogul quick, she don’t want no local dick
She want a nigga on some global shit
Walk through looking like I sold a brick, so legit

[Verse 6: Phone-EG]
Phone-E like your necklace, leave you neckless for your necklace
I’ve always been reckless
And I like that Nexus, hit you unexpected, leave your face in your breakfast
Phone-E hit the rooms, grab all the chains and the pendants
Grab all the gold and I took your bedset
And best bet, it came with your bitch named ‘Lexis
Now ‘Lexis, come take a ride in this Lexus
Now get this endless penis in your precious
Senseless is the size but it’ll slide like Tetris
I told her say ahh, call me Phone-E the dentist
Or Phone-EG Cardio, I leave her breathless
But switch the flow up, because I’m tired of that
Gun heavy, shoot the sky if I want your hat
And if I see you on the map then it’s Mortal Kombat
I’m like Raiden when I…. Oh, oh, is that the end of the beat, Sunny?
Okay, next song[Intro:]
Yea
I'm goin' in

[Verse 1:]
Excuse my persona, green tea Arizonas
Skins cappuccino, with a lighter mix of mocha
Neck ain't even froze up, but I'm loco with my loca
Plus my wifey drive me crazy, so I call that girl my chauffeur
Hit the beat, Sammy Sosa
Swagger leaning like a post-up
She sitting on my lap and says its comfy like her sofa
Shooting like a pistol, but she holds me like a holster
She say I got The Knack, so I call her My Sharona
These rappers never get it, I tell them get off my scrotum
They worshipping my pole like it's religious, totem
Isn't livin' so nice
You dudes are right behind my jeans
If your life's great, then mines is greater with no tiny cheese
Ya'll confuse my eyes and think that Pryde just be here chinese
Got your shorty bending down like she's trying to tie her sneaks
Prizzy keep on doing this
Pulling crazy fusion chicks
Repping for my asians, til' the day that I die stupid rich
Hundred thousand youtube hits
So haters will all get destroyed
Young Prizzy or Young Pretzel Boy (yeah!)

[Verse 2:]
Oh my god where did my head go
Hope the fans vote me No Pedro
Gotta race in the game, and you dudes all last
I'm Usain Bolt, and your leg broke
Futuristic, I ride with the best flow
Been doing this since the get-go
Inspectah Deck I'm the best, a threat
Got that Wu-Tang check yo neck flow
Wait, stop the instrumental
Put the beat back on, let me get dough
Put the dubs in the air like you just don't care
Even if I ain't repping for the West Coast
Don't you like it when I go fast
Broke boy still repping with no cash
Never smoke, but the boy got dope raps
All you be doing is hating, go withhold tax
The drama popper, I'm kinda proper
You gotta watch it
Back I'm flawless, go suck my willy willy no wonka wonka
Get me wrong on fifty songs
Kill them all physical
If G's move in silence, then I'm louder than an intercom
If you hate the new me, go find a new Russ
Prizzy be that big yellow rolling, no school bus
I'm about to wreck the beat
Cook it with no recipe
Yes I do light up like Thomas Edison invented me
Yeah the rhymes are hot, but my whole spirit is Decembery
Mars Music, NHB

[Verse 3:]
Got no paper because my money always be on absence
Homie, real geeks don't wear non prescribed glasses
Never touched the pot, not a fan of ceramics
Wipe you away greasy rap artists, I'm fantastic
I'm about as good to Canada as Steve Nash is
Or like Drizzy Drake, or like Michael Buble cause I’m that sick
Massive, my fame's growing slowly on the internet
I'm considered as the best and I ain't reached a milli yet
Ask the freaking fans they'll freaking say that Pryde is freaking fresh
Not allowed to swear, but your girl said I'm the friggin best
Go hard when I roll though
Rappers don't want beef, they tofu
Dudes going Super Sayian like Goku
Killing all these beats, that your produce right
Killing all the time, plus I got this game steady on my mind
Hitting hard on ya'll, let me take my time
All you little Bad Boys, ain't go no Shyne
I'm really weird, I'm Pryde, and your girl really wants me deep inside
So I tell her no girl, get a decent mind
And I killed it, you dude's say, oh my God (God!)
I be killing major contracts
I be signing six foot, seven foot, thats my height for when I'm rhyming
Because in this rap game I'm a giant , yeah

[Outro]
Well alright, ya'll gotta watch out for my album man
I just felt a little pissed off
I had to do a couple bars for you
Six foot, seven foot, six foot height
China on the boards, oh yeah
Mars MusicLook
Better watch your place, boy
Fuck around and get erased boy
Here go another motherfucker that be talking shit about me
But can't say it to my face, what a shame boi
Shit you ain't everything you claim boi
I can see it through your eyes
Realize, I don't gotta knuckle up with you to prove you bitch made
You ain't gotta talk about your accolades, bitch I done that, woah
Short fuses for the douches
If you really live my life you will see how to win
Talking ball to these hoes, tryna be like the man
But bitch you snapchat shit, I just see it again
Hold up, nowadays boys wanna be the fucking boy
But it ain't no one that can be like all the other boys
They talk a lot, like oh I keep that shit 100 boy
Shit like man I heard that from a 100 boys
Fucking bucket, we know you a liar
Your whole swag got old man you know it retired
So you switch it up
Like, ugh shit, I know we inspired
You play this shit through the aux like you know this is fire hold up
I tell her I ain't really drive the U-haul
Uber rides is how i make them bitches cruise home
Have her wake up in the morning at the condo
I have her walk up out the lobby riding in a Yukon
Hard work get's you large perks
Eating good I bought some large shirts
Cause this belly got me going R. Kelly
Put the key up in the ignition
Baby tell them that I'm flexing
Homie i'm just flexing
Moma still need attention
They like why you smoking cigs?
Shit bad, shit'll kill you
But I'll tell you what will kill you more than anything, stressin'
Homie I'm just stressin'
I tell her that I mean it
With fiending needs for this cream
And my team is leanin' for cheese
So we schemin' and losing sleep
Steady dreamin' for everything that we needed when we was teens
That was money, power, respect, Stacy Keibler and Justin Bieber's net worth
You bitches is dead first
We getting this bread first
Then give them the best curse
It's a fact, that I'm gifted as a fucker and I'm getting to this money
This year all i've learnt was never listened to the fuck shit
Everyday and everyday and everyday, I'm hustlin'
And I don't gotta butt kiss
I let this tough love shit
I'm about to say last thang, I'm about to say last thang
Fella, you was hot back when Nelly wore a band aid
God damn, that's lame

And I'm not stupid bitch, coming from the motherfuckin' 905
But everybody says we're from the 6, I see the lies
And I'm not stupid bitch, I'm not stupid bitch, I'm not you
Cause ever since I came back on the scene, all these youngens wanna hate right now
Yeah I'm the most hated in my city, I'm proud, I'm proud
Still without a co-sign, I'll be wasting no time
Plan A's coming I'ma bout to steal your whole shine
Richvale clique

Plan A[Verse 1]
Yea, OK
Show's over we done ran it with a clean up
Get your popcorn and your peanuts
I just came in stunting trynna scout some new workers like I'm Regis
Who wants to make a milli baby, we up
They just always fake than natural like implants with them D-Cups
They diss you then they Goku, after you make 'em Freeza
And you bitch be drinking balls, scratching both their knees up on this clay rock
Let's cash out with that Ridin' Round with that Nina, motherfucker
I done played the bitch for way too long, baby
I told 'em fuck it let's get on
Taught 'em how to look at thotties, this right here your song
And let me see that tho-th-th-tho-thong
Shit bring it back, Prizzy Prizzer
Bosses right on you interns
They try to play me salty, but they sweeter than a Twizzler
I just broke the door down with all my fucking hitters, and made this bitch close what it isn't

[Chorus]
I just tell 'em Adios (Huah!)
Goodbye, motherfucker time to go!
Hasta la vista! Au Revoir, Farewell, Adios
I swear that y'all been in this bitch for way too long
Hasta la vista! Au Revoir, Farewell, Adios

[Verse 2]
Look, Grand Benz on that [?] like I'm Hov
We walked in like fuck your little velvet rope
Walk up take the mic, like boy forget about a host
Turn it up, make a scene, and then I Rolls Royce Ghost
Making stacks, spend the stack, and making double that
My ethics make these old heads get their hustle back
These young boys make the older men pissed off, like now I sell some too fast, I don't fuck with that
But we don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
I told them hoes I'm too real baby, double truth
I had took a couple L's to get a W
Even if I went to Australia I still wouldn't be down under with you
We did it, we did it, I get it, I'm in it right now
Beginning to win it, I'm picking my fit for the crown
His chick is committed, but Prizzy is dickin' her down
Tell you friends fuck what they say, because this is the sound

[Bridge]
She said baby I love you, I want you to stay
I tell her I'm busy, girl, please not today
Her man is complaining cause I'm fucking better
Then I call them up and I tell 'em

[Chorus][Intro] [Wax]:
Yeah, throw ya hands up
Herbal T throw you're motherfucking hands up
EOM put your Godamn hands up
D-Pryde put them motherfucking hands up
East coast up your goddamn hands up
West coast put your motherfucking hands up
Midwest, dirty south throw your hands up
Whole world hands up, come on

[Verse One] [Wax]:
Feeling like I was possessed by the devil
A mislead mind of a desperate rebel
Tryin to get money but I'm going about it all wrong
Day in and day out I'm pumping out a raw song
Trying to give y'all
A small touch of the realness
Tryin to show all of you ducks what the deal is
Couldn't give two fucks if you feel this
I'm already hungry what's another meal missed?
Concerto of a growling stomach
Trying to out climb us and you're bound to plummet
We just lounge on the summit, over looking all the peasants
Laughing at how they're not even aware of our presence
And with every sentence, the march gets louder
And drowns out all the remarks of a doubter
Yeah let em all scream "hate", tell em all get a plate
Let em all eat cake bitch!

[Hook]:
Make way for the symphony
We got a short supply of sympathy
When EOM drops the beat it's history
Fuck a guitar we playing air timpani
Ayo
Make way for the symphony
We got a short supply of sympathy
When EOM drops the beat it's history
Fuck a guitar we do it like dum dum dum dum

[Verse Two] [Wax]:
Ouch
Dagger to the heart
I've demonstrated swagger from the start
I moon walked out of the uterus, on to the table
Me and Herbs did the Kid-N-Play before they put us in the cradle
Your boy is not stable
Fresh off the pot like a boiling hot ladle
I'm old school fucker, ya boy just got cable
And I ain't even trying to join the top labels
Cause I'm not trying to be something I ain't
Like my taint you can feel me like dry paint
Yeah, cause it;s a well known thing that every song these days is a cell phone ring
And sometimes I wish I'd try an sell those things
But it's alright like a Saved By The Bell opening, man
I pull a reference out of my ass like a dingle berry
Simile samurai, words of Mike Singletary

[Hook]:
Make way for the symphony
We got a short supply of sympathy
When EOM drops the beat it's history
Fuck a guitar we playing air timpani
Ayo
Make way for the symphony
We got a short supply of sympathy
When EOM drops the beat it's history
Fuck a guitar we do it like dum dum dum dum

[Verse Three] [D-Pryde]:
I rip strong
Spitted on shit songs
Bitch your shit's wrong
I'm "Il" like Kim Jong
Listen check
You'll be lying like in sit and reps
Talkin' 'bout your clique and "clack"
Shut it man, that shit is wack
I don't think we're on the same page
I'd light y'all fired and bring you back on the same stage
I still kill, and you better get your necklace checked
Your better off to ask Rihanna for an S.O.S
I spit dreck and I'm all day, mate
Spittin' lies at your eyes like Kanye's shades
Check it
A live wire
Yes, I'm a fly diver
My lyrics are the shit concentrated on, high fiber
You stressed and bitchin'
Homie I think you're best to listen
Rest and churn right before I deck in your digestive system
You better listen and you better pay homage
And haters you get the rector thermometer motherfucker!

[Hook]:
Make way for the symphony
We got a short supply of sympathy
When EOM drops the beat it's history
Fuck a guitar we playing air timpani
Ayo
Make way for the symphony
We got a short supply of sympathy
When EOM drops the beat it's history
Fuck a guitar we do it like dum dum dum dum[Intro: D-Pryde]
D.P. Rizzaaaahhh
Turn my auto-tune on right quick

[Hook: D-Pryde]
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got music on my mind I can never get enough
N' every time I step up in the building
Every bodies hands go up
N' they stay there, N they stay there, N they stay there
Up down, Up down, Up down
Cause all I do is win, win, win
N' if you going in put your hands in the air, make em stay there

[Verse 1: D-Pryde]
If you ain’t here a voice, It’s a Filipino boy getting on, D-Prizzy on the beat now
If I ain’t one of the most for the best little kid I think we need a little recount
I’m a beat down
I’m Jet Li now
I’m the one get it done ever renown
Killing every bitch I beat up on the market
If he shoots for the stars catch me on the rebound
I’m blazing threw the streets cause my music is mad
Well known Skywalker like, Luke was my dad
Came in the game poofing like, who is this lad
Unsigned Valedictorian, in music’s my grad
Without agitated facts, I’ll pass your haters facts
See the crown growing up like a graduation cap
Cause you riding the what
Cause we riding so free
Now she’s riding with us cause you couldn’t ride her like me!

[Hook: D-Pryde][Intro]
My head’s under water but I’m breathing fine
You’re crazy and I’m out of my mind

[Verse]
All them other fellas lame, and you know it now
When a real man holds you down, you s'posed to drown
Bound
Honey you know everything real here
And you know I’m really tryna get my shit together
The future is just everything I still fear
But I’m tryna grow
Got ya back right behind ya though
My love ain’t limited, time is up
So I gotta give you everything before I go
And this shit could be like any day, any time
You know I hold heavy weight, but I’m fine
And I know you got baggage to be claimed
You ain’t playing with the game, so I’m stepping to the plate
When you hurt, I hurt
When you tear, I tear
When you smile, I smile
I fear, you fear
My year’s your year
We both walked the same miles
Lemme lock them palms, in between my palms
Catch me if I fall
And you know I ain’t the richest but I’m working ‘til I get it
If there’s anything I give you, I can give you my all
My heart needs help
You right there with a huge bandage
I can mend it, I just gotta put my pride down
Might be 90 in the summer
But without your great love it can feel below zero outside now
Where you going with them great looks?
You a little trouble maker, ain’t you?
Isabel Marant, girl that isn’t what you want
You need somebody to raise you
Higher and higher, Bonnie & Clyde ya
Yeah that's cliché, but you want it that way
You want it so cheesy
Maybe we can settle after shit I need to do
Maybe I can do better
Fit me like a new sweater in the middle of the fall time
It’s gon’ last a long time, for the best of all time
And you know you stole my heart, it was a small crime
Don’t worry baby, things are gon’ be all fine
Things are ‘bout to be all fine
Things are ‘bout to be all fine
Yeah, yeah
And if you talk about all, I give you all mine

[Hook]
‘Cause all of me, loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I give my all to you
You’re my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
‘Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Bridge]
Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we’re both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it’s hard

[Hook]
‘Cause all of me, loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I give my all to you
You’re my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I’m winning
‘Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
‘Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you(Intro)
They say that they gonna stop me
They say that they gonna shoot me down
So I ain't leaving 'till I get my applause
Oh-oh
Get my applause
Oh-oh

(Verse)
Yo , I be down for applause
I ain't leaving 'till I hear the crowd
Pounding their palms as they vote for me
They memorize the sound of my songs
So we can leave the city showered in bombs
Drop on 'em when the wolves come
They won't even know what to do
Tell them haters I'm the newest number 2
And know that I'm the number 1
But you get what I really mean
Raining our parades as we thunder
Through retreat these mics
Like mice on food ,if I'm underground
I'm digging right up under you
Pop up on your ass by surprise
Like homie, wassup with you
Draked-out, nerdy, but you know I do it dirty
Dead wrong like a blood wearing the colour blue
I've hustled through the lies
And mistakes, and now my rivals will greet me too
So I will just wait, 'till the time that I make it
To deny in this face , if I hide what I'm facing
I'm a fly through the place I survive on the stage like

(Chorus)
They say that they gonna stop me
They say that they gonna shoot me down
But I'll just keep performing
So I ain't leaving 'till I get my applause
Clap for 'em
Get my applause
Clap for 'em
They say that they gonna stop me
They say that they gonna shoot me down
But I'll just keep performing
So I ain't leaving 'till I get my applause
Clap for 'em
Get my applause
Clap for 'em

(Verse)
Who really wants to mess with my day
Got the whole crowd screaming my name
Hey,hey,hey
Negativity be slipping away
But I just got to throw my fist in it's face
Kill these dudes out with confidence
So I'm 'bout to bash on 'em,hell
I'll even swag on 'em, I'm throwing the mask on 'em
Hold me the spot now, I'm ready to rock now
And once the show is done
All they gonna do is clap for 'em
Clap clap clap
But the bullies got the best of me
And everybody brought me down
And tried to mess with me
Rock this confidence, on my wrist
My accessory, next to me
And this determination is my ecstasy
We ain't leaving now, we ain't leaving never
This is for the teachers and the friends
That up and left my side
Be the realest in it
That phrase just has the best words
When the show's done
They gon' be yelling Pryde

(Bridge)
So clap for
Clap for me when I walk on stage
Oh-oh
Clap for
Clap for me before it's too late
Oh
So clap for
Clap for me when I walk on stage
Oh-oh

They say that they gonna stop me
They say that they gonna shoot me down
But I'll just keep performing
So I ain't leaving 'till I get my applause
Clap for 'em

Clap for 'em
They say that they gonna stop me
They say that they gonna shoot me down
But I'll just keep performing
So I ain't leaving 'till I get my applause
Clap for 'em
Get my applause
Clap for 'em[Verse 1]
(Sorry)
You told me that I'm not the same as I was
Timing all switched up
Forgot about the love back home after all that shit we done
And back then you used to pull up, park the car in my spot
You hated college, you talked to me, and we smoked a bit and then fuck
And years went on and we grew apart
I disappeared, I took a flight and ended up in New York
You went home with all the same friends (Same friends), lame friends (Lame friends) but how long are you going stay the same?
I done seen a lot I didn't come right back to love you
But it's just all when you see sunsets out in California
I've been in more hotels than house keeping
Escape to hotter places in colder seasons, but that's the reason I've been gone for too long
Just to be set for life
Been out here, chasing this money, I know that shit don't sound right
But if you've seen the shit I've seen, then I feel you'd understand
Everything has gone according to Plan

[Hook]
When was the last time you saw
A little something new cause
I haven't been around for you
It's cause these things ain't the same

[Chorus]
Wait, you can just come right around my way, right around my way, I'm sorry that I never stayed
I feel you should just come right around my way, right around my way, and you'll see why I ain't the same
Oh you should come right around my way, right around my way, tomorrow isn't like today
Around my way-ay, (Alright!)
Around my way-ay
Around my way

[Verse 2]
How are you?
How has shit been?
I've been living life for every restaurant is a sit-in
I've been in positions where I get attached to company, and figure out they're only round for business
What is this? Did I put a price tag on my fucking face
I used to be so special, but you found another fate
If we talkin' bout do's, I've been underpaid
To all these women that I love that haven't called in days
But I swear that last week I was near the shore
Took a trip on out, it was a break from home
Seven missed calls, eight new texts
I had thought by now you'd leave me alone
I just got over drinking and being super unproductive
I don't give my heart to people I don't fuck with, but most of y'all do
Shit, I don't really move how most of y'all move
I wish you know how empty I was, forget it, I'm cool
Wish I had genuine company instead of these feelings, being on isn't as cool now is it

[Hook]
[Chorus]
[Hook]

[Outro]
Why are you even talking?
You haven't even been around much, how do you, how do you fucking know what's going on here?
What do you expect me to do, just to fucking follow you around everywhere? (Right around my way, right around my way, tomorrow isn't like today, around my way, way-ay)Fresh up out my moms vag, New ring on, Lebron swag//

Would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether thats right I will never know (ugh but here goes nothing)

[Verse 1: D-Pryde]
Part of me wants to be asking mom for some cash to you it's something simple
But I'm an unemployed teen with a money issue
Yeah I rap but the cash in the rap game isn't what you be thinking
Thought I'm rich well no its different
I'm chillin back in Toronto looking back at my family
Struggle like damn a week ago I was chillin living it up out in New York
But things get crummy here dads getting old and the fam needs money
Yeah Damn
Talkin bout you ain't ghetto russell, but since when
Did people have to live in ghetto's to struggle, Huh?
I could have been normal with an hourly salary but
Instead I fly the globe to change this life for my
Family sittin in gabs van dreaming about being old boys
Grown men stunin' up in a Rolls Royce

Whether thats right I will never know (ugh but here goes nothing)[Verse 1]
Man we just paid off that lawyer
Yea, I feel like we’re in debt
We need to bleed success but you ain’t felt that feeling yet
You don’t succeed unless you fail
Yea, my momma taught me that
And she got cancer, so I’m fighting just like her in a hospital bed
Man they pushed me
Hard for me, these deals – they never called back
Selling dreams I ain’t up for all that
Shows are cancelled, I ain’t with it
The top is looking distant plus nobody wants to give us no assistance
So we’ll do it on our own
No help, no wealth
No majors, just ourselves
Where’s your team at? They ain’t working it up
We been in the dirt, I know you ain’t workin like us
Just quit the frontin and giving us fake budgets
And telling me I got talent
You lying but oh I love it
I just gotta stay on top of it, dominant
I’ll do this on my own ‘cos that’s exactly how I started this

[Hook]
They don’t know the struggle and the things that I’ve seen
You can do you and I’mma do me
But I will not fall
‘Cus I have it all
And the pressure’s eating me to the core
Stay motivated, I’ll never fall to the floor
But I will not fall
‘Cus I have it all
With my back against the wall

[Verse 2]
Yo, fake dreams they gave me
Haters be talking crazy ‘cus this watch isn’t an AP
But look what you bastards made me
I’m build off hate, I got my skills all played
I’ve witnessed notes to my face, I’ve witnessed real talk fake
And things hurt you
We put in too much work to have it all gone
Bills are overdue but I will not fall
Labels tell you oh we’ll hit you back
They will not call
Or they give you crappy deals to play while you just sign your life away
And all these A&R’s are idiots, they can’t all manage
You could fill arenas with these dudes who skipped on talent
But I can’t fail
From now on I hate all
This music must be full-time, I’ll never have a day job
I came in here to take all
Confidence is something I won’t overdose
Penetrating labels with I told you so’s
I will not lose
As long as I got my head in the clouds
I’mma die tryin to make my momma proud

[Hook]
They don’t know the struggle and the things that I’ve seen
You can do you and I’mma do me
But I will not fall
‘Cus I have it all
And the pressure’s eating me to the core
Stay motivated, I’ll never fall to the floor
But I will not fall
‘Cus I have it all
With my back against the wall

[Verse 3]
We made smores, at the same day we buried my friend
And his son was at the studio, right after the funeral
I do this all for him
Grinding for my team, sticking through the thick and thin
Momma told me that she only got 5 years to live
Crying on my shoulder like
Son, remember I told that you gotta be real famous before I pass away
Just imagine all the pressure kickin
Have it all stress ya

[Bridge]
Countless nights and days I stayed in here
And I worked so hard
Been knocked down way too much
But still I had to play my part
And the lights flash in and the lights flash out
I’m still here and I won’t back down
I know, I know
I got my back against the wall

[Hook]
They don’t know the struggle and the things that I’ve seen
You can do you and I’mma do me
But I will not fall
‘Cus I have it all
And the pressure’s eating me to the core
Stay motivated, I’ll never fall to the floor
But I will not fall
‘Cus I have it all
With my back against the wall[Intro - JusReign]
Yo this is JusReign, and you're listening to Richvale Summer you fuckin' bitch, and Pryde you suck
Thankyou

[Intro 2 - Pryde]
Real shit, real shit
Your plug, I finessed it
Your girl, I finessed it
Holdon, break it down
I just got one more thing to say, Richvale Summer

[Verse 1]
Rollin' out clean with a baddy, she drivin', she whippin' the ride
Pushin' some serious shit so she really take care of her car like there's children inside
Outfit on take, got some serious reps, I'm just breakin' your neck, I'm just killin' your eyes
Savin' the day like the hero, but man if you really look close boy the villain arrived
I touch down like aye, I just walked off like holdup
Me and Danny 'bout to go hammy up in your town, and y'all can't control us
We ain't came from the hood but we still gon' bump
What you get boy? Still no fucks, only the real showin' up
Shorty on the pill, she blowin' up my phone, but I will not cup
I'm screamin', screamin', screamin', screamin', I've been through enough shit
Spent it all but still I'm still ballin' on this budget
Got a shorty who I fuck with, not in love with, but she blowin' up my phone trynna wonder what I've done

[Hook]
Comin' from that North Side
I got bitches all on my mind, I got money comin' on time, [?] doin' mad crimes
I got bitches, bros, figures, so then keep bangin' my line
I got bitches, bros, figures so then keep bagin' my line

[Verse 2]
Holdup, holdup, holdup, holdup
Pop that pussy for the chinky kid
You just like "Wait did he really say that?"
Bitch I think he did
Suck dick for some Trukfit, what's with all these fuckboys trynna butt kiss, maybe cause I came up from the underground, been through all the tough shit and everything I write sound crispy like a cutlet (I'm down)
I walk in like I'm lethal, black chicks, white chicks, "Hi nice to meet ya'"
Smoke somethin', get high with the crew, I mean so damn high that you look like my people
I need to go on vacation, my shows are amazin', my clothes are mistaken for style
This money in piles, but I just invest it to make more and spend it on flyin'
Now baby if you were in my shoes, you would be ignorant too, you would talk shit like a fool, come and get lit with the crew
Do all the shit that you said you would do
But you live a basic ass life, you got a basic ass bitch and a basic ass mind
You hate on me and waste time, if you need me bang on my line, just bang on my line
Run up

[Hook] (x2)[Intro: Talking]

Uh, J said he really liked this one, I'mma have to go in.. Look!

[Verse 1]
Even if it kills me, I can't go back to my hometown
Until I get the money that I need, I'm going all out
Still don't got a diploma, still don't live in employment
Losing sleep for enjoyment, but still this life gets annoying
Man, its been like 3 years, where the hell did I take myself
I made myself stronger than any person my age and health
The people I'm around sold them dreams, all we do is just dream fight
Whole team faded while were living this dream life
The money, gold chains, the dudes I wanted to be like
Working at hotels, living that suite life
They said be careful what you wish for, cause things might change
Here's a question, if all of this disappears, would ya-

[Hook]
Would you love me, If I had nothing?
Cause it could all go away any day now
I could fall any time on my face
So I ask can you love me, even when I have nothing?
Cause it could all go away any day now
I could fall any time on my face
So baby can you believe, believe, believe in me
Believe, believe in me
Can you believe, believe, believe in me
Believe, believe in me
Would you love me?

[Verse 2]
It ain't a real dream if you ain't lost something
It ain't a real dream if you ain't thought about quitting
In all my life I witnessed terror with my mom suffering
So yes, I know the real price of what it cost to be different
What it cost to be the best, cost to be the illest here
Premature millionaire
This could be my realest year
But still I feel like I could lose it all easy
I can't fail I see my team, I know they all need me
People died along the journey, it's sad
Cause we bout to live the life they would've had
So we gon' pop a bottle that's gold
For all the followers bro, Cause we could lose this all tomorrow... You know?
I'll ask you hoes..

[Hook]
Would you love me, if I had nothing?
Cause it could all go away any day now
I could fall any time on my face
So I ask can you love me, even when I have nothing?
Cause it could all go away any day now
I could fall any time on my face
So baby can you believe, believe, believe in me
Believe, believe in me
Can you believe, believe, believe in me
Believe, believe in me
Would you love me?

[Bridge]
'till the clock runs out and I drop dead
I be the realest, while breathing and living
Baby, its history what I'll make
I'mma be nothing less than great
I'll take it all the way
I'll take it all the way
Would you love me?

[Hook]
Would you love me, if I had nothing?
(If I had nothing, yeah, yeah)
Cause it could all go away any day now
(Any day now)
I could fall any time on my face
So I ask can you love me, Even when i have nothing?
(If I had nothing)
Cause it could all go away any day now
I could fall any time on my face
So baby can you believe, believe, believe in me
Believe, believe in me
Can you believe, believe, believe in me
Believe, believe in me
Would you love me?[Verse 1: Pryde]
They heard you living life like a star
Your making money, living life on thevroad
And everybody knows who you are
Open mics turn into sold out shows
And everything is different
Cause life changed in a blink of an eye
And everything is gorgeous
This all came and took me by surprise

[Hook: August Rigo]
And you never know, where this road is gonna take you
Left to right, its gonna shake you
Up and down, round and round
And change you all because
Your living life just like a

Big shot, you the man, number 1 at the top
Life changed, welcome to the life you never had at all (x2)

[Verse 2: August Rigo]
August, from the tida, down to the coast of Costa Rica
Introducing the good life August glad to meet you, feel you
This may not last forever, but I'm glad that were together
And I love my girl but music is that shit
So I guess for now we'll put up with that distance
The oceans apart will never change perception of who you are to me
And baby, all of the lights and camera action
I'm experienced in all my way to get it where I'm headed is just a show
Understand that you are with me girl in every step, and every where I go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pyrde]
Living with no stress is with feelings to just hold breath
And I'm a kid G-Shockin', just looking at these Rolexes
Surrounded by the city life, hang around the streets galore
Hard right out the fact that this the life he's never seen before
Across the world, so proud, fans love him no doubt
Show up to the venue, and it's looking like it's sold out
JFK, LAX, AUS, no pit-stops
Luey love, Gucci dreams, I'm living like a big shot

[Bridge]
You're living life just like a big shot
You the man, number 1 at the top
Life changed, welcome to the life you never had at all
Big shot, you the man, number 1 at the top
Life changed, welcome to the life you never had at all

[Hook]Verse 1: D-Pryde]
Uh, YEAAA, Uh, Yea
The flyest asian dude up in the room, I undertake it
Callin' little Prizzy underrated is an understatement
I be that one Canadian, I be right under Drake but
I just hit the top now it's time to tell you punks I made it
Bet y'all never heard that I'm better than your herbs
Get the message ready, set, go it's revenge for all us nerds
Got the game straight jackets, that's psycho to you typos
You mistakes overweight, with my swag you act like lipo
Suck it in, no you ain't, homie I am dope and tight
You now I'm right, my swag's Beyonce but I ain't HOVA wife
You're weed on tracks, I'm coke on mics
You're desert dry, I'm polar ice
Racin' through on overdrive, no chauffuer but I'm so inclined
To kill ya, better get so familiar
MARS MG so familiar, we just smile and grill ya
Okay you're worth cash but what's a bankroll to a million
I hit beats like I be Williams, Serena
Better respect me, Aretha
Fire to you haters, I be blinded through your radar
And okay you're a goon but boy I'm Tyler The Creator
A Goblin, a goblin you ain't sayin' nothin'
I hit your girl three week ago
And that floozie ain't called since

[Hook: D-Pryde]
Oh Yea (x4)
Yo J, They ain't ready I'm goin' back in

[Verse 2: D-Pryde]
Zooming through the streets lookin' not so great
My car is out of level but It's not Jordan
With the numbers on the can with the best green tea
I kill these dudes, give me any beat
INot worthy, I'm dirty, these rappers will never burn me
If they lit my ass on fire the slightest flame won't concern me
And every single city, I got ladies in a trance
I tell 'em drop it low and they do it with no pants
You make me really want to have you suing you just grooving
My bilinqual girl will be speaking like that booty was from France
To inclined to you I'm high
In this game it's do or die
Homie if I'm corny, I know what you are
But who am I
You just look like one of these emcee's I should tear up
You're losing to a loser with a Justin Bieber haircut
Born to win, born ill, born fly, born chill
I'm use to living nights like my hotel room's a porn film
You just think that all their girls are faithful
Not these chicks, cause when they see a star the get indecent
Little homie I'm the greatest thing you've ever seen
I be oregano to your recipe, playing the game
I don't need no referee, got the rules ain't nobody gone mess with me
I go NY, TO, worldwide, we know that if you stand right here
You are guaranteed to die from a 3rd degree burn or a heatstroke

[Hook]

I said now, I said now this right here is my pet rock
Got these asian girls so ready to give me a free massage
Need yo girl and a couple dollars, that cutie wanna holler
But you bet my main goal is still to score Nicki Minaj
I Do it bigger than you ever thought I'd do it in a year
Got some dirty frickin' bars feel like sewage to your ears
I'mma ruin your career so just stand the hell back
I'mma preach these morals to you, I'mma pastor this track
You just really want your girl, You can't get that frizzle faster
Try to to get up in her jeans but her zipper got a password
To her I am a hacker, shout to my ex chick
We just couldn't measure, guess the love just wasn't metric
And y'all wanna know what I think about her inner history
But let me say whenever he's inside you, you just think of me
I do it, I do it, Big Sean said it awesomely
I'm Tommy Green up on the beat looking like I won the lottery
My life is just a movie scene, truthfully you ain't cool as me
Cool ya feet movin' to the beat, you and me that's foolery
Who is he, a groupie skeez, you all look like buffoons you see
And there ain't no "I" in team but there is in "I Am Doing Me"
I still kill it though but it's killing me
She rode me in a Honda Civic forget a stretch limousine
And to stupid haters swallow the little me's
Waiting til' my dough-nuts, Krispy Kreme
Oh you know I'm crazy, I give faith to you
I'm with anime girls that look like Sailor Moon
I pray for you right before I'm slaying you
I'm done this verse, you chumps had heard I ate your food
Prizzy bye![Hook]
Bitches and gold
All of these hoes just came to your show
They all just came to your show
Bitches and gold
All of these hoes just came to your show
But is that all you really want though?

[Verse 1]
It was all a dream
17 in XXL magazine
Used to flip to that page with my little article
Can’t believe this little bedroom was where I started from
Wonder how my old friends are, I grew apart from them
No offence to them dudes, they’re probably doing well
Wonder if they got some stories, something new to tell
Too bad I’m chasing what I’ve wanted since a youngin
I feel like I lost the game like it was nothing
I used to treat this shit just like a hobby
Made my first 10 grand and I fucking lost me
And that’s some small ass money but at the time it was a lot
And in this huge shark tank I was a guppy
God damn, fuck me
But fuck you if you didn’t believe
People get mad when you make livings, wait, but is that just me?
And all these gold chains hide all of my insecurities
So before you judge me quick, baby, please, listen to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look, real shit, real shit
This one rapper got mad cause he found one of my tracks
Thought I was sneak dissing him
But I ain’t with all that hood shit, that’s not the shit I’m good with
Truthfully, if we fought he would win
And no offence, do your thing, homie, you shine
I won’t fight back, I’ll stunt on you in due time
Meaning this shit is competitive but I do this shit effortless
Didn’t mean to get out of hand when I said that shit
I never signed up to carry guns with me
Or gain caution to anybody that runs with me
I be damned if his homies shot anyone with me
This music shit went from zero to fucking one fifty
All I wanted was some bitches and a cheque
Now this rap shit’s bout physical respect
Why couldn’t we just make money as a whole
Instead of beefing with each other, shit is old
Bitches and gold

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This chick Gabby was at my house once
She was in my bed, we just made out once
I was leaving for New York and I’d be back in a month
She said when I was back we could fuck
She talked to me bout my life too
And she could have been my wifey now
I left town for a while, recorded, did me some shows
I came home, god damn, she let me down
You got a boyfriend? I stayed loyal but it seems like you enjoy him
Maybe cause he’s just around and I’m always out of town
Man, this coulda woulda shit just gets annoying
Then I wish I was normal, but that doesn’t work
Making a five figure salary off dreams is a perk
And I’m lucky if I really hit six, that’s a goal
Till then I’m draped in all these bitches and gold
Bitches and gold

[Outro]
So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect so we never dare to ask the universe for it. I’m saying, I’m the proof that you can ask the universe for it. Please
