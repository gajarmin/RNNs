[Intro]
Ayo, black, it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Straight out the fucking dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo

[Verse 1]
Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holding an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme, now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sitting bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughing at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscing about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggas be running through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, "Back up," the Mac spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran – I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck"
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jetting to the building lobby
And it was full of children probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pulling the triggers bringing fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stickup kids – they run up on us
45's and gauges, Macs, in fact
Same niggas will catch a back-to-back, snatching your cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she's got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers in measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation, inside information
Keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind

[Hook]
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be having dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinking Moets, holding Tecs
Making sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewing up the blocks to sell rocks
Winning gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin'
Thinking of cash flow, buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'm a hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black
I'm living where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blaming us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I've taken rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm an addict for sneakers, 20's of buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

[Intro: DJ Premier cuts]
Money ain't a thing if I got it (x2)

[Hook]
Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough

[Verse 1]
Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and
Balenciagas, balance my saga with the henny aqua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
This kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who put the clown I lock, jaws like a blue nose, foes
Keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due

[Verse 2 (DJ Premier cuts)]
Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't  easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream
Who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene (x2)
(Joey Badass) cause
Cash ruined everything around me (x3)
(Won’t sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (x2)
(It ain't easy)
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all (x4)

[Hook][Chuck D]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

[Intro]
It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

[Verse 1]
I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Numero Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number 3: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4: I know you heard this before
"Never get high on your own supply"
Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em "bounce!"
Number 6: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8: never keep no weight on you!
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10: a strong word called "consignment"
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say "hell no!"
Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

Crack King, Frank Wiz-zhite

[Intro - The Notorious B.I.G.]
This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you
This goes out to you
This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you

[Verse 1]
Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don Dada, fuck Poppa
You got to call me Francis M.H. White
Intake light tokes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low and keep firin'
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip on that cat with that grip on rap
The most shady, (Tell Em!) Frankie baby
Ain't no telling where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecoming
With my man Capone, gumming, fucking something
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen before
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious
Penis before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get - who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than "Great Adventure"
Biggie ("How are you gonna do it?")

[Hook - 4X]
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more

[Verse 2]
On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked for death
Should I start your breath or should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically I'm worshiped, don't front, the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishing, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them cause they nothing but dicks
Trying to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro, rock diamonds that's sick
Got paid off my flow, rhyme with my own clique
Take trips to Cairo, laying with your bitch
I know you praying you was rich, fucking prick
When I see ya I'mma

[Hook - 4X]

[Verse 3]
This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the King of N-Y
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya brailling it, snatch that light shit, I'm scaling it
Conscious of ya nonsense, in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, "Vigilante"
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my children
One shot they disappearin'
It's ill when MC's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home Ready to Die, listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragile, my nine milli
Make the whites shake, that's why my money never funny
And you still recouping, stupid[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Hook]
"Dear God, I wonder can you save me"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God, I wonder can you save me"
"Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me"
"Dear God, I wonder can you save me"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God, I wonder can you save me"
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"

[Verse 1]
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
Cause when they're saying too much
You know they're trying to get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out, couldn't understand
The mechanics and the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine to five is how you survive, I ain't trying to survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body
I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Picking their brains for angles on, all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee, we used to stay up all night
At slumber parties, now I'm tryna rock this bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close, now I see his fears
Through her tears know she's wishing we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be, in time
I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My flesh, no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist, got me doing sticks like "homie
You don't know me but the whole world owe me, strip!"
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
So now I'm down for whatever ain't nothing nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beating me down, boo
Got me running with guys making G's, telling lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers
Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils

[Hook][Intro]
Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal: it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, negroes and latinos
And even the gringos

[Verse 1]
Yo, check it
One for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forthcoming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell, 8 Million Stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keep in orbit with the probable tenth
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide project-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor: better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the "cha-pow!" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets like
69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5-minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right: "You Are Not Alone"
Rock your hardhat, black, cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

[Hook]
"The Mighty Mos Def" "it's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"  "I revolve around science.."
"What are we talking about here?"
"Do your math"
"1, 2, 3, 4"
"What are we talking about here?"

[Verse 2]
It's one universal law but 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you be in for life, mandatory
4 MC's murdered in the last 4 years
I ain't trying to be the fifth one, the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 Million Ways to Die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 P.M., where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate? It's nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business: no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code to S-S-I digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for "who is" and "who ain't niggas"
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it: it's all mathematics[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Hook]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 1]
Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners, they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryna watch us and knock us
And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about Gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moet drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennesey while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'mma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too with Swoop, Bokeem
My brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

[Hook]

[Outro]

[Nas]
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life and every projects, all over
To my man, Big Will he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogi
Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit, Ph.D
And my man Primo, from Gang Starr
'94 real shit y'all, (Harry O), fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though

[Nas' posse]
Bitch ass niggas (Bitch ass niggas, young bitch ass motherfuckers)
Come to Queensbridge motherfucker!
(Yeah, yeah)
Let's bring it back, that's just a warm up cause I can-
On anybody anybody[Lil Fame]
Here comes the revolutionist, executionist
Flip a triple six into three nines, cause a crucifix
Each man holdin, no man foldin
Coast is clear and Premier's in the green tank rollin
Prepare, get on your post and stand clear
They wantin to shut us down but the home team's here
What? You act like you're sweet or something
This ain't no Desert Storm bullshit war, we all dumpin
CODENAME, Jamel Grinnage
Wit six clips of teflon, suited in camoflagued
Got kevlar helmets wit masses
Wearin mob gear in cause they try to infumigate us wit gases
MISSION--to seek and destroy
We were sent to get rid of you, make the situation critical
First Family will gradually, lift that ass up like gravity
And turn your body frame into a cavity
NFO--that's No Fair Ones
Watch me nine milly turn into a flare gun
Sparkin wit the same marksman
Known for gunnin and runnin and bombin
Wit the ?lyrics? squeeze of my gun barkin, YA HEARD!!
You know my family style
I'm goin out wit my gun in my hand like Big Mal
I ain't got nuttin to lose, so move on me if there's something to prove, fool
This is war

Chorus
"There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from" [Prodigy]
"So what you gonna do since you know now"
"There's a war goin on outside" "It's impossible to stop" [Guru]

[Guru]
This world's a twisted maze, but I got the swiftest blades
My swords they can slice and dice precise ways
Those who come against me, can get blazed, sprayed and laid
No trace, just a glimpse of my face, hittin the shade
You look up, there's a full moon in the sky
And all my would-be enemies, yeah they're soon to die
Livin in this warzone, we frequent fly at home
Many of us grow violent prone, ain't tryin to be dyin alone
So I'mma take the competition wit me, Lord forgive me
But a whole bunch, of blood-suckin punks, is out to get me
In a flash of a moment, I slash vital components
Tryin to scheme on me and my team bitch, you know we own this
We can scrap, wit guns, knives, chains and bats
Whatever baby, erase that ass quick fast off the map
Plus they better bring, medical attention after I swing my weapon
Won't be no recovery, no divine intervention
No prevention, from gettin hung in the streets where I'm from
'Nuff blood shed, this war's just begun

Chorus scratched and cut up 2x

[Billy Danze]
How many predators out there that want me
That's how I stand off, NOW
I come to diminsh every one of you blood suckers
Hands off, lay em down NOW
ALL CULPRITS, be alarmed
First Officer Danze reportin for 'Nam
When I'm bringin the storm, I'm all in
Yes I done stepped in the chest of many men
THEN AGAIN, it's a part of my persona like puff stumps and marijuana
IIAAAH, ?soutch? em out,  FIRE
]From all angles, that's how we was trained
Either slay or be slain, it's in the game for my soul
To be as cold as the blood in my vein
Knowin my name, help niggas perform abnorm
FIRST FAMILY, let's get it on
Just keep in mind I'm a marksman, I'm sensitive about that there
So you better watch what you say to me, hear?
PLAY WIT EM fierce, know where to run
So I post and defend, forgive me Father I may sin
And thou shall remember the code of the street
(Hold heat), roll deep, (don't sleep) or you'll be murdered
Since I've arrived I learned how to survive on this earth
Holdin down this turf, now I declare WAR!!

"There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from"
"It's impossible to stop" (YEAH!)
"There's a war goin on outside" "It's impossible to stop"
"No man is safe" "There's a war goin on outside"[Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in "Who's The Man"
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a Rasta[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Your boy got it popping like Crisco
Number one independent on the east coast
I rep the streets, I don't do it for the weirdos
I am really with the [?] yo
I been having women and gold around my neck
I'm a hustler, what the fuck do you expect?
Roll with the lex, ride Benz don't roll with the Lex
But y'all push 700's they ain't mold to you yet
Been getting bread so long, is there mold on it yet?
Something like a pimp no ring on my pinky
Full in fur, coming through all minky
Big cuban chains coming through all linky
Shitting on haters, leave you all stinky
Phew!
Said I would leave you blue
Get it, men do what they say
Troy Ave did it
I brought New York back like Earl the Pearl
Now BSB records 'bout to conquer the world

[Verse 2: Detroit Che]
Yo, yo, yo
Last year I was watching it from the couch
I stayed in tune with all my dreams
Haters see me living them out
I'm from Detroit, Michigan, homie, it's the home of the Lions
My homies was dying, rock hoodies during moments of silence
Passionate, practicing activists doper than [?] put a cap in this
Renisha's shooter switched it and said he did it on accident
Rest in peace to Mcbride and Mike brown and Trayvon
They days gone and they was so young and it touched me
Like an iPod but I won't cry
Government they gave us nothing and they say that we don't try
We get robbed like corner stores for justice and I'm so tired
I'm super tired like carrying ten Mariahs
Put tires around my neck I'm finna start a riot (let's go)
This the book of hip hop [?] illustrate
Don't compare me to Nicki, my titties been deflated
And that wasn't a diss, I swear I look up to that chick
But critics be talking regardless putting these bloggers in coffins
Queen Che

[Verse 3: Dee-1]
Just holla at me if you need that real
And if it's true that words are weapons, Dee packs steel
I did it solo, no aid
But Dee's that ill, I [?]
And thieves that kill can't steal that skill for real
I'm a positive black man, beware in the streets
Don't compare me unless it's to the man America leads
Sit back an reteach [?]
Unashamed coming for they neck, watch your clavicle
They say "Dee, who was your cosign?", mine was God
My watch made out of concrete, times was hard
You's a mental slave dog, why you robbing and stealing
Money don't buy happiness, ask Robin Williams
I'm in the building, I'm probably on that pelligrino
Dolphin that rhymes on my feet, I think I'm Dan Marino
It's Uno, cut the deck, you know he won
Cause New Orleans watching this saying "Go Dee-1!" (yeah)

[Verse 4: Logic]
Allow me to murder this
For anybody that may not have heard of this
It's the L-O-G-I-C I'm repping MD yes y'all know the deal
We keep it real all the time, V's up, that's on my mind
I'm feeling infinite, like Eminem's first album
Speak to the people like Malcolm
Murder your mind in a minute, like the Millenium Falcon
Rip the mic and yeah I know the outcome
Check it, I'm biracial, but couldn't tell by the facial
So everybody swears that his parents wasn't interracial
But if I had dreads, sold drugs and screamed "Fuck the feds!"
Then maybe, just maybe they might give me some street cred
Even though I grew up with that all in my house
Ain't gotta glorify that shit, there's more to talk about, but
Don't get it twisted, I'm far from a mad rapper
If anything I'm the finest of dead president kidnappers
I got so much on my mind but not enough time to mention
Cause I'm ripping and living and striving and killing [?] going and flowing
I'm only spitting this fast cause that's how y'all gonna pay attention
Cause we on TV
See they don't care about what I'm saying, just how I'm saying it
So I gotta spit it fast and make sure that there's no delaying
Yeah, well, but if you're one of the few that want the real and not the lesser
Go to iTunes and cop that Logic album "Under Pressure"
Yeah

[Verse 5: Lil' Mama]
I said don't ask me about no broads, no rap wars
I do this for my Mike Brown brothers that's really at war
Therefore, y'all better close y'alls jaws
When it come to me, cause y'all gonna need wraps and gauze
I'm the underdog, clear, y'all ain't gotta like me
Gather your best armor bodying me less than likely
I swear on James Brown if you try me
Red Hook Summer like Spike Lee
Bloody gloves, we in the ring like carats
This ain't the first quarter, but I'm balling like it's March Madness
Heh? I got 'em pinched cause I'm lavish
When you're in a motel you better hold your bladder
Now what they talking about this MC deficit?
Like I will run up on that stigma put a death to it
Man, realize that I'm the best at this
And I don't gotta wear a dress to be addressing this[Intro]
"Oh, it's you again! Don't you ever give up?"
"At one time I thought of giving up, but now I think differently"
"You can help change things, by learning more about your culture"
"and believing in yourself."
"Oh yeah? You gotta be joking."
"It's no joke. Tell me!"

Primo!! (Reks)
{"No time for looking back, it's done"} Listen
{scratched: "You betta take off, before I break off"}
{scratched: "I don't give a fuck, I don't play that shit"}
{"No time for looking back, it's done"}

[Reks]
I'mma write this here rhyme like Guru's in the passenger
Standin on the East coast, starin out to Africa
Accolades, Escalades fade
My vernacular remain in tact for the generation that's comin after
The average rapper you praise days numbered like a calendar
Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter
IV's, wrap 'em up, mad as fuck, need a ladder up
Escalator, elevator, skyscraper, hella haters
On Primo beats, meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts, hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chop can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap, true dat, who dat be?
Mr. 'Say Goodnight,' I'mma blaze the mic willingly
Kill or be killed industry, and the realest of the real emcees
Solo flow enemy, future of the rap
Golden Era dead {"No time for looking back, it's done"}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
{"No time for looking back, it's done"}

[Reks]
Before I fade to black, face the mirror, face the fact
Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow, fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me, calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect, I'm a vet
Y'all are just wakin up, 'Say Goodnight'
Slap a rapper, take his mic, greater height
Spit a rhyme saber like
Inner mind paid the price, A-B-C-alike
Hey Preem, we a tight, chemistry
Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line
If you more than rhyme this
{"No time for looking back, it's done"}

[Hook]

[Reks]
You ever chant with the rebels, dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels, ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go, stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified, exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all, achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out, they 'bout beat, by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young, hell or heaven
Them adolescents, is pedalin, packin metal and settlin
Street wars, revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls, psychos strike the right chords
They at pause, bumpin Ricky Ross
Kids is on crack, they lost
Wipe a lot, no time for looking back, it's done
Golden era over and dead, I'm over your HEADS~!
{"No time for looking back, it's done"}

[Hook]

[Outro]
{scratched: "You betta take off, before I break off"}
{scratched: "I don't give a fuck, I don't play that shit"}
{"No time for looking back, it's done"}
{scratched: "You betta take off, before I break off"}
{scratched: "I don't give a fuck, I don't play that shit"}
{"No time for looking back, it's done"}[Verse 1]
On the streets of Brooklyn, you see this kid looking
Tightning his MJ's, white and cement grey
You're sure to see a pair of Jordan 3's
Now you wanna talk legendary talk to me
Some break records, so no one forget 'em
But we don't break records, we the ones to set 'em
What's in a legend but cutting edges, perfection
With one obsession for staying on the top of his profession
And if it ain't broke, we don't fix it
And no remixes, no pre-fixes
And if it ain't hot we ain't repping it
You ain't getting no half stepping
Half court lames that could never play a full
Any little game just to see what they could call
A wolf in sheep clothing caught in lion, shit gets wool
You wanna be like Mike then save the bull
Many try to stick 'em, many try to pick 'em
And think slow, you made your D silent like Django
A broken ankle, and now your tanks low
One octane, but homie, not Kane for short
It's evident I'm the rawest specimen
Warlords and testaments to change your regimen
Spitting to the beat or either the record spin
You wanna see the magic? All I need is just a pen
Sheer excellence, to say thus far
You can ask Isaac Newton how you greet a star
You asked for 16, I went way too far
And I gave you 28, just to raise the bars[Verse One]

I'm too deep, and yes much too complicated
My lines when stated are quite often underrated
So consider it a privilege to hear this
Those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
Whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
Cuz you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowing that hard is something you can't be
So you front but you could never call my bluff
Cuz you'll catch hell you'll get dealt with

[Hook]

I never sleep
I always peep
Rhymes creep
I'm 2 Deep
I'm 2 Deep....

[Verse Two]

I forgive you, sike, I'm takin' your life
Cause' you continue to disrespect so I'mma get trife
But then again I think I'll spare ya
Cuz I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
See I'm the holder of the key
Don't ask me if I'm Muslim don't say nothin' to me
I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn't
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted I almost missed it
The chance yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self cuz I'm me
And the nation of Islam has my support
Cuz they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps
To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean
Say what I mean and I'm out
Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout

[Hook]

[Verse Three]

For right now yo my religion is rhyming
Perfect timing test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Sheite, Jihad
All must regard the times are hard
Unite or perish
Is the message I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we're all black why have so many divisions
Superficial factors are drawing us apart
Don't let it happen
Let's put some respect back in
So before I act I think cuz it's the brink of destruction
Word corruption what's up son your gun is just one
And I just might have one
Or two or maybe even three or four
And plus an army of 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice

[Hook][Intro: Nas]
Yeah, hahaha
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"Nas.."

[Verse 1]
Yo explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin his cess, punchin his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon and Jungle, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin
Livin carefree laughin, got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo I'm in my second childhood

[Hook: repeat 2x]
"Cause when I flow the for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours, nigga"

[Verse 2]
Yo, dude is 31, livin in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin, got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin L's
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Saved by his mom's, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Baby girl she's always talkin name droppin hangin late
Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin
E poppin Ecstasy takin, won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin, stuck with limitations
Lustin men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel
With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin, mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person, never matures
All her friends married doin well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life, guess she's in her second childhood

[Hook][Verse 1]
Oh my god, ya'll niggas didn't want none of me
Premo, you should have let me chill, let me be
Now I gotta attack, pull out my rap stacks
Show all these bitch-ass niggas they can get backslapped
Queensbridge, that's my motherfuckin' kingdom
Poet's my name son and that where I came from
I been a motherfuckin' terror ever since day one
I was toting Glocks, niggas was playing with play guns
Everything is motherfuckin' real I say dunn
Get out my way dunn, I'm about to slay dunn
Beat you like a slave dunn, make you obey dunn
Poet don't play dunn, the outcome? Critical crucial
The shit I'ma to do to you make hell seem beautiful
I murdered this shit intro to outro
I got real dogs that straight eat Alpo
Straight take you out yo
Show you what this gangsta shit be all about yo

[Hook]
Poet's coming, click boom
2 to the stomach
I give it to whoever want it
Poet's coming, click boom
2 to ya stomach
I give it to whoever want it
The thug poet
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Poet's coming hardcore
With a new style for the art of war
Let the Hennessy flow, let my enemies know
Niggas is dead if they not kin of me or friend of me yo
You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real
Tryin' to penetrate my forcefield, get all killed
You don't want to see the mac clip all the way filled
Big nurse the motherfuckin' gat all in your grill
My shit is banned from t.v., banned from radio
You gotta cop me on the low like a bag of 'dro
I represent the street, I represent niggas hungry
And they wanna eat that gangsta shit
Guns out, blunts lit, polyin' over the strip
Renegades, crack-slingin' soldiers
Hustlers locked down for moving real boulders
Thug bitches that don't play the kitchen, they play the street
Cause fuck that, hoes gotta eat
Poet's comin'

[Scratched]
A thug poet
You think I'm playin'

Hit 'em with that shit Prem

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's a lot of niggas comin' in, a lot of niggas comin' off
A lot of niggas frontin' like they ill when they butter soft
Competition looks thick, got a lot of niggas locked
But they ain't like me, I'm like you, I'm like from your block
Shot g's with gym stars, dump d's in marked cars
Stay a real nigga in the street and behind bars
Fuck the radio play, I don't need it anyway
Remember back in the day in L.A., N.W.A
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Gotta get my motherfuckin' shine on, murderin' every beat I rhyme on
Niggas light up with me, bitches get drunk with me
No rapper and no company could fuck with me, see
Straight like that, I got that king cobra venomous rap
Get in my face and I'm gone give you a smack
I'm on some what what, Noreaga shit
Pull out, spray this bitch
Blaq Poet: hip hop's most dangerous

[Hook]Hook:
'95 is yours 2000 is mine
And we're walking through the ghetto and the feelin' is fine (x2)

Lil Dap:
Before I wake up I thank the Lord for the day
God bless the dead yo we came a long way
Brothers just don't know how shit gots to go
Yo check it where you're from
From the east how it goes
I'm from the east no joke where the old folks pack
Sayin' "Shortie go head kick it with your fly ass rap"
Yo I'm rappin' for my niggas I never see again
360 degrees as the world still revolve
Problems still unsolved but my faith is still in God
Listen to me bad boys if ya think ya fly
Best to get on your job handle your B.I
'95 is yours 2000 is mine
Uh uh uh check it out

Melachi the Nutcracker:
Yo I'm a legend and none can even step to me
I just perform on that ass like an assembly
So what's up I'm kickin' down doors
Leavin' ya sore from my literature
Raw is how I get and mic I rip
Bullets I use to insert in my clip
Fuck the bullshit I bust a shot to your head
Another buisness hit leavin' motherfuckers dead

Hook

Melachi:
A-yo brain cells bust when I flow with the rough touch
Opponents that step up, get fucked up
Gangsta style buckwild I'm livin' trife
To be precise yo I kill a fuckin' mic
I grab my microphone and start killin' niggas
I'm bustin' out rhymes I'm not pullin' triggers
I'm like a prowler stalkin' my victims at night
I leave a blood sight when I get uptight
Yeah so now that you know
The Gang Starr Posse we get mad doe
That's how we do and the feeling is fine
'95 is yours 2000 is mine

Lil' Dap:
I'm goin' 95 South smokin' lye with my nigga
My dreams of success money kids and land
Got a master plan how to stack my grand
Check it the poor won't be poor and the rich won't have shit
My name is Lil' Dap and I'm feakin' on with the lip
Yo son chill let me concentrate on this bill
Now these snakes on the street tryin' to kill these rap
Yo survival in effect yes we all know that
Yo we come in peace but if you cause you got to have it
My crew will bring the havoc start the static
Yo that's how we do it cause the feeling is fine
'95 is yours 2000 is mine

Lil' Dap talking:
Uh champagne wine baby pa. New York style

Hook[Verse 1 - Bahamadia]
Salutes to action be tha latest enter-ree for Illadel colonies
To get da cream like cherries jubilee
My steeze put cha at ease like methamphetamines
Or like Tony Starks fantasies about his wallabees
Two fit-een ya meen Big East be comin' through
Ghetto magic plus da bullies back it what
Me now Buddah Blessed for I and I
Provide da greatest naturale pure as life that exit from the gentatile
Styles international like direct connects from internet
Verbal text blossom like Chia Pets
Perfect wit da mic devices Bahamadee be tha nices
Bringin' nix rap thing to the light like Osyrus
For tha' 9 pound Exedra peace to GangStarr and my nigga K-Sarrah

[Hook (3x)]
We gonna rock this motherfucker like 3 Tha Hard Way!

[Verse 2 - K-Swift]
Ha yo, I'm doing this for the crews claimin' that they're better
I'm tickled, ya must be like Sanford on the ripple little by little
I kick verses of the middle of my brain
The Riddler couldn't fuck wit Kannon Riddles
I remain the undisputed you should it known if you knew it
Montell couldn't tell you how we do it
If you get the chance to even do the battle dance wit da Kannon Band
Shit be slammin more than Larry Nance
And plus it's in me to give you more like Demi
I do easy, leave the hardway to penny
As I display skills for what it's worth
Sent to this earth to put the curse of whack MCs upon my turf
This is the end like Armageddon your settin a bad example
Niggas still using samples times ample
Ha yo Swift never said she was the baddest but I kept it real
You niggas frontin talkin bout you packin steel
You be sportin a first all up in rectum
By them Central kids sitting all up in the bully section

[Hook (3x)]

[Verse 3 - Mecca Starr]
Do you remember those you chose to forget back when ya ears was wet?
And now ya preachin' me releasin' mini-tec
I need a mic check because da static come sparatic
Emcee's be hooked like addicts while casualties stay tragic
There ain't no glamour in that story all guts no glory
Entrenced in jealousy just like the suckers who abhor me
They tell but they don't know the core, so raw is now my reference
Like Mumia there is no evidence to say that I'm more tha I am
Undbending never ending similar to million men
Me say "Just-us" you say me bust bust
Mental stagnation like the cancer patients eatin' cow fuss
As the minds rust
From dawn to dusk I rest in Mecca
The words sound power as in energy see Heka
To die because ya black simply be no cause at all
Surreality just like the lengends of the fall
Initial looks of the shook hearted kids who shouldn't started
Lyrics leave like spirits and And the waters Moses parted
Do or Die's ya slogan but niggas slip with Trojans
Major mental corrosion like Murray's meat unfrozen
I am the Chosen Earth Sun Moon and Stars
Hard for me to find a top contender just to spar
Some peep the exterior and think inferior
Next ya know they callin for a Sound Bwoy Burial
D&D Studio B wicked catch wreck for infinity
One love peace to Bahamadi'

[Verse 4 - Bahamadia]
Like Salt N Pepa, I take it to the next plateau
Niggas scream they what this Brown Sugar like D'Angelo
I make it better fo' fantanics fienin For da Buttaz Boo
Like 25 to lifers do from lack of gettin' Power-You
Oh, I put my little thing in action smooth like satin
Or Special Ed when he was taxin'
Heads relax and play tha' back when I spill
I regulate a flow like chicks on birth control pills
Ill anitics Keep it movin' on
Bouncin' like nylon from Illadel to Lebanon - (no doubt)
It's 3 Tha Hard Way[Nutcracker]
I'm lossing my mind yo I'm outta control
Heal your mind take your time fill our soul
This life I live, do you know how it is?
Rough and tough, fucked up for the kids
Is there hope? sometimes I can't cope
Forgive my sins because my whole life broke
I don't understand the world today
A lot of people die in the evilest way
Mentality disturbed from the things I saw
Dead bodies in the crib dead bodies on the floor
And when you're down you have no friends
Forgive my sins Lord forgive my sins

[Lil' Dap]
My little nigga is my nigga 'till the day that we die
Clean out my insides before I rest my eyes
For you sneaky ass niggas in your dirt poor chick
Lyrics and thyme connect but when you pop that shit
I concentrate on a girl, forget about the bad
Remember the things you had, and just be glad
Now I'm on a new ride on the road to success
Mad cash in the bank and mad assets
With my new

application

I can build my dreams
Put my brothers to work, no need for schemes
Listen to me from the bottom of my heart I speak
Mothefuckas is getting open because there is no peace
Check it out

[Nutcracker]
Step into my black abyss
I'm crushing crews in my fist so tight
That you can hear when they hiss
Is like this if you don't have a clue
Going thru anyone and your crew too
Like a teck so you better watch what say
I manifest catchin' wreck on the mike check
The Nutcracker, never get my name wrong
Another sad song, but I get it on
Everyday like Marving Gye
So thank to yourself, today could be your last day
You better pray or no one wins
That's why I say forgive my sins

[Lil' Dap]
I move quickly with the wind when it starts to storm
Mothefuckas is gettin' tortured that's my word is born
Got troopers in the East all over the world
Not local international and this for my girl
Feel it from the bottom of my heart things ain't' right
Everything will be ok as long as we stay tight
God bless my soul and forgive my sings
Yo these devils are all around me and they got me trapped in
But my faith is strong so I got to move on
You can't hold me back in case you're beefing for rap
My mind will react the hype lyric substract
Kicking in pass and tracks that make the brother react
In fact, tired of make it rhyme and to act bold
Watch the story unforld when the Group home explodes, uh
Check it out, check it out[Intro: KRS-One]
Come! Come with me now! To a time, long forgotten

[Verse One: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)
I grew up in the streets, like everyone else
But instead of pushin drugs I push knowledge in self
While them cats was in the back, smokin them moolies
I was buildin with the Gods, who used to wear kufi's
Africa pendents, with sevens on them
Real black man summit y'all never saw 'em
The cops caught 'em, real leaders, real street preachers
Black Panthers style Poor Righteous Teachers
This before the cell phones and the beepers
Conscious black men with fly new sneakers
Both styles came from us, guns bust
We were Criminal Minded but In God We Trust
Not that white man God the other one
We didn't call that God we called our brother one
And our sister was the Earth, peace God
No need to act it (Now let me bless y'all with some jewels)

[Hook: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding, freedom
Justice, equality (Food) clothing
Shelter, love, peace, happiness
THESE ARE THE JEWELS TO LIFE


[Verse Two: KRS-One] (*DJ Premier Scratchin) (**Grand Puba)
(*Oh my God!) Where you think the cypher come from? (The Gods!)
Who you think them cops were runnin from? (The Gods!)
The streets were hard but the streets had Gods and Earths
(**Sun, Moon and Stars!!!) This is my universe
Rebirth, a new way of seein
Seein black people as celestrial beings
To raise our whole self esteem in
We started Third Eye seein and seein what Martin was dreamin
Gods on the boulevard buildin on life
Wise Intelligence, King Sun, Just Ice
King Aziatic nobody's equal
Rakim, these are enlightened people
The 5 percent, visit The School Of Mecca in Harlem
If you never went, It's good time spent
I'll bet ya come out with a new tactic
But while we here (Kris go 'head, just drop it)

[Hook: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)

[Verse Three: Grand Puba]
I deal with actual facts, I keep it right and exact
And If in doubt I do without so I could stay on my route
The original man the true ruler of the land
Related to the universe by the Pineal gland
Armed with epidermis so the sun won't burn us
It's natural while others fry they in the furnace
It's God Body don't let the 10 percent fool ya
Teachin lies and false religion so that they can rule ya
Why oh why got you lookin to the sky
Got you believin that you 'gon get some heaven when you die
Meanwhile, the 6th sense 'til you turn
Unit followed by 21 ciphers you should run
196 million, 900,040 thousand, and we still in public housin
Now It's our turn, listen
Like KRS-One say, homey, You Must Learn[Intro]
"It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space."
"The mysteries of creation are there."
"Up in the sky?" "Up in the sky."
"The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked."
"Prepared for lift off."

[Verse 1: Guru]
I Self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwave, causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
And watch another Cee Cipher pulling my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turning a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers, little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten percenters, promoting slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

[Hook: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds raining down
Holding it down

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply ya with the fire
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn, we come rumbling through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch something
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

[Hook x2]

 "Watch out for your friends"

Aiyo, aiyo, you you you got that thing for me, huh?
You thought I was layin it? No no I ain't layin it, I'm takin it
You don't understand? You confused?
How bout if I stuck your fuckin head thru that window
That would unconfuse you right?
Thought I was layin it, give me the fuckin money, come on

I'm blamin lame ass rappers frontin for famin
I should open up a casino for all the games you playin
I'm sayin, everyday in a different namin
Plus they homos now, big black niggas flamin
We stressin, that you don't be stressin us
And if you GS and GS then don't be B-S'n us
Just be B-S'n logicly, not like that we be guessin
Because the truth need no modesty
Cristal to spring water, Bacardi whatever
What it is is what it is, we can party together
You know how the game goes when your name grows
But still love is love, fuckin the same hoes
Against the grain goes the souped-up rapper, he spittin venom
So now we gotta get wit him
And do the ten thing, frightenin, while his mens cling
Then watch blood extract out his ass like ginseng
It all ends with all of his mens hit
And now our future friendship, strictly forensic
But that's the life we livin, drivin, that's how we driven
Strivin, you must be robbin, cos I ain't giving, shoot ya guns

Now when we bless this, with precise shit
That we suffice with, we keep your mentals lit
Now when we bless this.......
"Watch out..."

I see ya overly concernin, ya insides burnin
Mad at the fact Sauce is earnin, with more niggas than Mark Furman
Ya never learnin learnin, never been so determined
Not to be concerned with ya sermon, wheels of fortune still turnin
Still street caviar remains untouched
For Sauce Money cheeseburger deluxe
Screamin what's the croc's fienin, dough we rake off
While you hailin for cabs we, taxi for take-off
Fake crews and units is dubbin
Get ya whole clan wiped out, no scrubbin
For the description given, chapstick flappin
Pistol-whippin nigga rappin, sell arms to keep em clappin
Gungho chicks squeeze for me, crazy G's for me
To see cheese come easily for me
In the same arenas, ain't gotta state his name, you seen us
Few bundles of dope never came between us
Sippin on Bay Breeze's, now we higher than Venus
Comparin thumbs, tryin to see who's the greenest
High strung, no relief pitcher off my tounge
Ace of the staff, Sauce back-to-back Cy Young

Now when we bless this, with precise shit
That we suffice with, we keep your mentals lit
*repeat x3*

In the club lit, listen to all my niggas hit
Bitches love me for this disrespectful shit
Fuck em, the only thing I'm with is large amounts, clear
Money the only thing that counts here
By any means like Malcolm
X marks the spot, you know the outcome
Income, never outdone
Rap star, hit the stage dipped in tar
Other crews muerto, can't fuck with this concierto
Too fecicous so I drop new releases til your crew deceases
Screw your pieces, fuck your thesis
Fuck your speeches and fuck your beef
Cos when my crew aim, do more than brush your teeth
It'll split your shit, when it hit your shit
If you don't want your shit hit, don't forget your shit
We don't spar, we aimin all niggas to Allah
When it's spent and to the nazarine if ya 85 Percent
Do what I gotta, straight shot of Jack
Amareddo colada for my bitch in the back
Never bluffin, never rap for nothin
Rap flow, don't love it, sincerely yours, Sauce motherfuck it[Hook x2]
[Akon Samples: "Blaq Poet"]
(When I come to the hood)
You know what's poppin'
(Ain't nuttin changed)
You know what's on

(When I come to the hood)

[Verse 1]
It's like woooo-aaahhh!
Ain't nuttin' changed 'Po whatchu gonna do man?
We still gettin' money, bitches still actin' funny
They wanna hold somethin, can't get shit from me
I'm back on the block, passin' the rock
Got my young squad, you don't want 'em bastards to pop
Rhyme veteran ready to get it in
Way before fif I was hated by many men
When I come to the hood, you know I'm creepin'
Leave you leakin', missiles heat seekin'
Nuttin' to talk about, fo' pound in your mouth
New York in the house, I dare you to walk it out
Straight menace, fight to the finish
Niggas get demolished, diminished I mean business
Millionaire rappers still wanna envy me
They wish they was mini-me, I'm sick on any beat

[Hook x2]


[Verse 2]
Niggas need those
I'm on a hill, where all the fiends go
Big bottle of yack, the big gat
Niggas fall back, I got the biggest crap
And when it's time to go, I go hard
Fuck the police they got a job, I got a job
Ain't nuttin' changed, except the weather
Except the chedda, except a nigga got betta
After all these years and all these beers
I got niggas still running in fear, why?
I ain't killin' nuttin', I ain't lettin' nuttin' die
Niggas know the repercussions if they fucking try
Shine up, stand up and a puffy eye
Besides that? Blaq Poet, a lovely guy
Run around have fun in the hood
Get love from my thuns when I come in the hood

[Hook]


[Verse 3]
Ain't nuttin' changed
Niggas still pumping the rain
Things still come from the train
Still gotta tell them mothafuckas no change
Niggas still on the block, holdin' em thangs
Some disappeared like motherfucking Blaine
Some got hang, some comin' home, some in the zone
They all can't wait 'til I tell 'em that it's on
Blaq Poet army across New York
Ya'll niggas don't even talk, You done prim with a fork
Screwball disciples get at you
Niggas don't like you, baseball bat you
Or sit up on a roof, and snipe you
Miles away, 50 cal rifle
A real gangsta is good in any hood
A real goon comin' soon to your hood

[Hook]Verse One:
Now I don’t be foolin' around, I tell the truth. Nothing’s secret

As devils search for the secrets to immortality
I alter my physical chemistry
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I exist even when no things are left
Vibrations transcend space and time
Pure at heart because I deal with the mind
That's why I compose these verses
Audible worlds, my thoughts are now universes
Written on these pages is the ageless
Wisdom of the sages, ignorance is contagious
So I hope you keep your focus
There's no hocus-pocus, in the end, it's just us
Devil got brother killin brother, it's insane
Goin out like Abel and Cain
Wisen up and use your brain
There'll be no limit, to the things that you can gain
In positivity, balance it with negativity
Until then, ain't the devil happy

[Hook]
[Scratching in the RZA's famous laugh on the song "Tearz" by The Wu-Tang Clan]

Verse Two:

I hate when the devil's happy, so I wear my hair hair nappy
Knotty, won't go out like John Gotti
He came from the caves to destroy everybody
And we like fools destroy our own bodies
Too many niggas chillin, bad boys boom boom
This leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
Seeds blow in the wind, another drug killing
What, are we accomplishing? Nothing
What's, the matter?
Why everytime I look around another brain gets splattered?
Some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
The devil's the only one who really gets fatter
Lead ruptures flesh, spleens are shattered
Dreams are shattered, another Queen without a King
What will out children become without proper guidance?
Probably nothing, so ain't the devil happy

Verse Three:

Niggas are in a state of nothingness
Hopelessness, lifelessness
If you're in range I hope you hear this
And try to change this, cause it's disastrous
Who gets the most loot, who gets bust?
Dollar bill y'all, is the god we trust
THe days blow by like dust
Even Men of Steel rust
We're out here acting ridiculous
When, only we can save us
Mentally enslave us, for little or nothing kill our neighbors
Animalistic, caniballistic, behavior
Look to the sky for your savior
He won't save ya, he didn't save your forefathers
Why bother, brothers? You must discover
The power of self, know thyself, or find thyself
Hating thyself, killing thyself
While he collects the wealth that you sit back and murder for
Ain't the devil happyHere we go, so pay attention to the teacher
Here to preach a lesson to reach ya
Brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews
Think that I'm joking? Well then F you
Cause I'm here to put you up on a crime scoop
It'll only take a minute of your time, troop
So don't be a dummy or a lame brain
Lord Finesse is teaching so just maintain
I'm not trying to diss you or even teach you
But here to teach you we are all equal
And show y'all in fact there's a better way
Than depending on Welfare or Medicaid
So finish up school and pass the scholar quiz
And show your children what the value of a dollar is
Cause many children are hard to please today
Cause they're searching for some type of easy way
But there's not, so who's at fault here?
So think about the lesson being taught here
How many brothers in the world you see today
Can say that they're living the legal way?
Out of 20, I could say a few of them
Out of seven I could say about two of them
Live correct and, show respect and
Don't sweat was is owned by the next man
Or front the role, being harder or tougher
Or live the life of a hustler
Selling that white stuff just to make a fast buck
But they don't stand tough when in handcuffs
So understand and comprehend and see, kid
You don't wanna take a fall like he did
Or she did or they did, or how others did
So don't sweat the lifestyle of another kid
Get yours by achieving and planning
So when they fall you'll still be standing
Set your goal, and know what your quest is
Open your ears to this positive message

"Listen up, listen up" "We're all in this together" - Cut 4x

Now I'll scramble, because life's a gamble
And like others, you go out like a candle
Like my man Tone who had crazy potential
Before he went to the house for the mentally
Disturbed, before he had crazy truck jewelery
If he wasn't scrambling, you could have fooled me
He was paid, to all the girls handsome
He could have passed for Donald Trump's grandson
He had what it took, the fame, the glory
Yeah, let's get deep in the story
Drug dealer Tone had everything sewn
Lots to own, he had a car with a phone
A cool brother, maxing, chilling
He always hung out in front of the building
But in the drug game there's no time for maxing
You always have others who want some action
And so many was jealous of Tone
Cause of the things he owned and how he got known
He had a few friends, or rather he thought he did
Some hired help, some really dirty naughty kids
Blood they shed, will kill people dead
And fill them with lead at the nod of Tone's head
For Tone, everything was going great
Because him and his friends would sit and conversate
He would chill, relax and just sit back
His friends got unruly, but Tone wasn't with that
Til one day he saw them sharing it
He thought to himself "It wouldn't hurt to experiment"
So they passed it (inhales) he hit it
There you have it, Tone got addicted
Like most drug stories, the end sound the same
Cause everything he had went down the drain
He lost everything, the money, the work
The car, to Tone, drugs came first
The wrong thing was for Tone to start that
He was getting beamed up like a member of Star Trek
The young brother went insane
Forgot his name, yo that's a damn shame
But someone in the street took responsibility
And checked Tone into a drug facility
Now Tone has a chance to get better
And clever, and get himself together
You may not like the way that I say this
But drugs ain't nothing to play with
So don't be pressured by what the grown say
Be yourself and walk your own way

"Listen up, listen up" "We're all in this together" - Cut 4x"Take the money never have to run" (3X)
"Here's how it goes.."

[Guru]
All for the cash man, niggas'll be ready to blast man
Mad hoes, 'll be quick, to give up the ass man
Traitors, they'll be robbing your stash man
Don't wanna end up like the last man
If the price is right, niggas can get trife awright
They plot and they scheme, all day and all night
And they might even get elaborate enough
To plan the illest kind of crime, fuck the average stuff
Like this chick who was kickin it, with this baller
Pretendin that she loved him, only really loved dollars
Holla'd at his man so they could, rendezvous
Said to his man, "Forget him, I'm fond of you"
So after the screw, she put him down with her plan
The utmost betrayal, this nigga's down with her man
But the sex changed everything, they conspired to snake him
Talked about the best time, and best way, they could take him
While in bed, she told him just where her man kept his dough
She said, "Yo, tonight he's bout to cop some blow
And I know, there's at least, 50 grand to show
Bring a gat, wear a mask, and come through the window
I'll leave it open for you, he won't never know
So run in, grab the money, later on, you and I can flow
If we do this shit right, he won't fight
Break out with the cash and stay your ass out of sight"
So the nigga sat back, but little did he know
He was about to ruin his life over a silly ho
And really though, the whole shit went wrong
Cause when he came through the window and pulled out it was on
Money they was gon' rob was high, on some shit
Dukes with the mask, told him, "Run your shit"
He said, "Fuck that shit!" So they tussled n shit
Then BLAOW, the burner spit, and the chick's man got hit
He died, his man had no loyalty, she's locked up as an accessory
His man's doin life, what a tragedy

All for the cash man..

"Never have to run"[Intro: Phife from "Check the Rhime"]
Now here's a funky introduction (scratching)

[Hook 1: Guru x2]
It's ALONGWAYTOGO, when you don't know where you're going
You don't know where you're going when you're lost (lost)

[Verse 1: Guru]
What you need is more direction and get yourself some protection
I thought by now that you have learned your lesson
I'm stressin' points and slammin' all joints you call the real shit
Correct shit, you know the busta way you feel shit
Baby, I still don't think you understand
You lose the game, we get more props than Dan...Rather
And it don't matter cause when you flinch, you're weak
So I'mma step just to speak about the counterfeit, unlegit type of people
Those cellophane ones, the ones that you can see through
It's poetic justice cause I'm mad with a pact
So precise, my insight will take flight in the night
And in the daytime, cause I don't come up with corny rhymes
I'm too devoted to the concept of gettin' mine
So here's the deal like Shaquille O'Neal
If you don't know what you're doing, how the hell can you be real?

[Hook 2: Q-Tip from "Check the Rhime" x2]
(scratching) How far must you go to gain respect? Um...

[Verse 2: Guru]
Now in '93, realistically you should be
Well aware of all the evils out there
It's like a jungle sometimes. You get the message?
You got to rumble sometimes, it's gettin hectic
Emotions run deep, as times run out
Solutions, it's time to find some out
So according to me, suckers are barred
From obstructing my discussion cause I rhyme too hard
You take a wiff like a spliff here, like some fresh air
I came to claim shit this year (this year)
So take a stroll down the walkway, or hallway, or runway
Fuck with us, kid, you'll pay
I slay and yo, I'm still on the expressway
I kick my essay, then you know we don't play
So pray down on your knees, G
Cause it's the best way, yes, the best way, cause...

[Hook 1 x2]

[Hook 2 x2]

[Verse 3: Guru]
There's a large amount of wack crews. For them, I got bad news
Time to pay your dues, you fools
I'm like express mail, with the script that hits
Like the third rail, when I shock the spot, it's hot
From the rays of the sun
Original one the prophet sent to become
A law giver, cause you shiver when I quiz ya
All about the real necessities of life
All about the game and all about the name
G to the A to the N to the G Starr
We know who we are, but do you know who you are?
(Richard Pryor: You go down there looking for justice, that's what you find: just us.)

[Hook 1 x4]

[Hook 2 x2]

(scratching) Um... (until end)"Hello please record a message after the tone"

[Intro: Poet]
Yo, what's the deal, yo whattup Primo, man
All these niggas man poppin shit, and shit
All these niggas is rich
Nobody wanna die, nobody really wanna kill eachother
Anybody just need to fall back, aha
Cause everybody payin'
Everybody just need to fall back and do them
"Yeah y'all, come on!"

[Poet]
Aiiyo Summerjam live, Jigga goin' at Nas
Yo...what's goin' on with these guys?
Next thing you know, Nas goin' at Jay
+Ether+ to the dome tried to blow him away
Motherfuckers wanna make it to some Queensbridge - Marcy shit
Believe me, New York, we don't wanna spark this shit
We still rebuildin', these women and children
The whole shit will turn to Ground Zero if we start illin'
Look at Foxy and Kim, what's wrong with them
Both of them platinum, used to be bitches
Now they wanna give each other stitches, damn
Is that how it is, when niggas get riches
You got 50 with Ja, 50 with Jay
50 with anybody that get in 50 way
G-Unit, Jadakiss and Beanie
That's a ill one believe me
They should take it to T.V
Cam'ron and Esco who got the best flow
DMX whoa goin' at ya little bro'
And the whole Roc-A-Fella wanna get at Jaz-O
Eminem, come on now that's a no-no
Disrespectin' your moms we don't play that shit yo
Even as a crack fiend mama, black queen mama
You learned 2Pac and that's the king of drama
Dr. Dre should've told ya
But he to busy goin' at Jermaine Dupri to show ya
But Blaq Poet pull a trigger
We know you nice, forget you white just rep it right nigga
I look over at the westside
I see Snoop, Suge, Xzibit 'bout to collide
And make some real nigga wanna cry
It's like niggas forgot about Pac and B-I
The only way to settle this; battle it out
106 & Park and leave the gat at the house
If not ain't no more to be yappin about
Get back to makin' your joints cause that's what rap is about
Yo that shit is weak and all y'all niggas know it
You can keep it on to lead it cause it's just A Message From Poet
SAY WHAT
That shit is weak and all y'all niggas know it
You can keep it or delete it, it's just A Message From Poet
"Yeah y'all come on!"
