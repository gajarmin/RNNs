[Intro]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the nigga kingdom and shit basically, know what I'm saying? I was like, this is like a fucking election
(2Pac) It is that. Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1 - The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - 2Pac]
It's on me
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed "thug life" and emptied the clip
Got tired of running from the police

[Outro - 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime
And my regime includes East coast
Includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything, you know what I'm saying?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him... Pac is a strong dude yo
I know dude, you know what I'm saying? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot
I was just more like, "again"
You know what I'm sayin'
He always gettin' shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm saying? But when he, when he died
I was just like, "whoa", you know what I'm saying?
Kinda took me by
I mean even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody, you know what I'm sayin'
Because there ain't no coming back from that[Intro]
Yeah, mothafuckas better know
I'm a bad bad bad
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls

[Notorious B.I.G.]
My man Inf left a Tec and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G: you with me?

[Young Biggie]
Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest

[Notorious B.I.G.]
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'mma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

[Young Biggie]
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, it's so hard

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yes love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant

[Young Biggie]
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?

[Interlude]
When he's sticking you and taking all of your money

[Hook]
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad) [x4]
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
[x2]

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent

[Young Biggie]
Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip

[Notorious B.I.G.]
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, (yeah nigga, peel)
Before you find out how blue steel feel

[Young Biggie]
From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka

[Young Biggie]
So go get your man bitch, he can get robbed too

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

[Interlude]
Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch (when he's sticking you and taking all your money)

[Hook]

[Young Biggie]
Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh money looks sweet

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Where?

[Young Biggie]
In the Isuzu jeep

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar

[Young Biggie]
Ooh Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot

[Young Biggie]
Oh shit the cops

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts

[Young Biggie]
So why the fuck he keep looking?

[Notorious B.I.G.]
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucka going out for the loot

[Outro]
Take that motherfuckers[Produced by Easy Mo Bee]

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Who the fuck is this? Paging me at 5:46
In the morning, crack of dawn and
Now I'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this paging me and why?
It's my nigga Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper

[Pop]
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

[Pop]
I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me cause now I'm warning you
I got the Mac, nigga tell me what you gonna do

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper (Repeat x4)

[Pop]
They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The Fifth Corridor

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts ringing
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals trying to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket - he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on you rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you?
I'm not running, nigga I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody coming[Verse 1]
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore
Appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one
Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

[Hook]
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"

[Verse 2]
All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the *blue suits*
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy: the place where my head rests
50-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
"What's love got to do"?
When I'm ripping all through your whole crew
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack life
Making money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby[Produced by Easy Mo Bee]

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold and that, what you talkin' bout Willis
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless, guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fucking Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze Gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt M.E
{Meth}...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
You don't want to fuck with the me

[Method Man]
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking, you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga, you won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kicking down your goddamn door
(And it goes a little something like this)

[Hook]
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, putting niggas back in I.C.U
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle-man, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
[Notorious B.I.G.] (Assume the position)
[Method Man] Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Bitch

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the Winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
[Method Man] I got more Glocks and Tecs than you
[Notorious BIG] I make it hot
[Method Man] niggas won't even stand next to you)
[Notorious BIG] Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so

[Hook][Verse 1]
I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is ...

[Hook]
Party and bullshit, and party ...

[Verse 2]
Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a Bad Boy
Niggas wanna front, who got your back? (Biggie!)
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast you, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "Let's leave calm"
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

[Music stops, indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling "Yo chill, man, chill!"]

Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that...

[Hook]

Yeah, you ready motherfucker?
We gonna kill your ass

[Verse 1]
As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome, homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The Q-45, Glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die!

[Verse 2]
As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Getting paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready

I'm ready to die!

[Interlude - Puff Daddy]
Nah we ain't gonna kill your ass yet
We gonna make you suffer

[Verse 3]
In a sec, I throw the tec to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some rec
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talking
You better act like CeCe and keep on walking
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, with stompin'
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking cheek drip
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die!

I'm ready
(Time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker)
Niggas definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
For ninety-three!
Suicidal, I'm ready!

[Outro - Puff Daddy]
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Yeah
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
(If I should die before I wake)
(I pray the Lord my soul to take)
(Cause I'm ready to die)

(All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to)

(Biggie Smalls the biggest man)
(Rocking on and on in ninety-three, Easy Mo Bee)

Verse 1:

But all I wanna do is spark a blunt and drink some fuckin brew (Me too
Nigga)

Take a toke and blow the smoke like a dragon
Timberland boots'll keep my fuckin jeans saggin
Pour out my liquor, bust some niggas that we missin
It's just a tradition, the 40 keep me drunk and pissin
This ain't the mission, easy rider's got to go (c'mon)
We're only smokin phillies, white owls or optimols
We've got the flows that are better with every letter
I keep it wetter, niggas better get they shit together
To raise the lever cos we're never goin out
So if you didn't know when, nigga this what we about (boy)
We about uhh

Chorus:

Sick of niggas askin "Yo what up with K Solo?"
Well I'mma fuckin bastard when it comes to gettin blasted

Cos oh my God, I hog the blunt like a boss
Baby sip the 'orty til the 'orty get me source
Court forcin down with no shorts and no laws
When it's down to the spit like Tela rocks and it's yours
Just take a hit a'time or wacked raps in your slits
So peep the cracks in my lips to the black fingertips
Nigga cos I crack you up like the Riddler (word up)
Plus I come to get higher than Hitler
Lay sessions with the skunk, keep my tape stretchin
From A section to niggas on lock in State Correction
So when I'm in your town at a club near you (aiyo)
If you got the bomb. mtherfuckers bring it thru
How we do

Chorus to fade[Intro]

[Verse Two: Dray]

Squeeze these cos we're gettin paid by the G's wit ease (word up)
We're blowin up your fuckin spot (no doubt)
Cos when you're hot, you're hot and when you're not, you're not
Now everybody be the nicest but Jesus Christ this

My advice is you better learn a trade
Before you kick a rhyme and end up fuckin gettin sprayed

You're just a pest of me, you'll never get the best of me

Poppin all this shit cos these rhymers don't amaze me

Back in the place I'm gettin stupid in ya sector

That's my recital, kid I flipped it til the end

The Books in reverse kicks a verse
I'm takin it to ya face, I'm iggity on the case I pursuit
To stomp an MC like grapes and then scrape 'em with the boot
I bring swing to the ring like Lou Duva
Diggity-got land like a cruiser, Pop Duke he rip a cougar
For pages, I kick it raw til my jaw caves in
Amazin and plus off-beat like caucasians
Me get done? Never son, I hold it down for 718
Where niggas fuck around and where niggas lay
Ain't nuttin slim, I got game like Tim Hardaway
Fouls like the proudest so I'm louder than RCA
Aw shit, I got you buggin, flippin that shit that you lovin
Plus I got another back in the oven
Some heard the style and then construction on it
But they just touching on it, bitch ass niggas ain't got nuttin for it
Come up off my blocks or I'll blow ya spot
I rock like that bald-headed nigga on Fox
(So how we do?) No shorts from niggas or they fuckin girl and (what you got?)
More styles than Delancey got shearling (no doubt)
So if you wit me and you're higher than a hippie, hold tight
Cause e'rything gon' be aight! (No doubt)

[Hook]
"Alright" {*repeat to fade*}Verse 1:

Here comes the conquering brother that fathoms and never ceases
Violators pick up the pieces (uh)
That are left behind as you're left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine
Rippin' on the microphone, receitin' poem
Givin' competition a Big Daddy syndrome
Some step up, (mmm) none kept up (mmm)
They rap a brief moment and then shut up
Lips are sealed because all of this is real
I'm not about frontin', I tell the real deal of society (what);
So how we livin
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Givens?
Not to offend
I just want you to comprehend every message I send (tell 'em)
Cause I don't understand, I have to wonder, damn
How could this lifestyle be fun to man
To see a brother gettin' paid undercover
Sellin' drugs to one another
Cause all the glamour you get is miscellaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um, um, let's say, un, poison
Destruction to all your own boys and girls who like to buy and give it a try
Admire and can't deny the high, that's why they soon die
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay
No sign of brotherly love
Just scavengers in search of.....

Chorus:

Another victory (cut and scratched)

Verse 2:

When I'm ridin' in my Volvo, cops harass me
They never ride past me, they hound me like Lassie
Wantin' to give me a summons or a ticket
Huh, I got a place for them to stick it (kick it)
They can't understand to see a black man
Drivin' a car that costs 25 grand
The first thing they say is "Where'd you steal her?"
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer
Huh, that just makes me wanna laugh
Cause now I'm a star and your son got my autograph
So all the cops on the highway gettin' me
My name ain't Keith, so could you please stop Sweatin' me
So I can flow and go on, so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on
Reachin' a summit as you learn from it
A lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh
The royal majesty, others have to be
Fully prepared, though they still won't last with me
So when you hope to hang or even handle
I'll show the meaning of power and just cancel (period)
Out of order, conquer and slaughter
You're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to
Compete cause the heat is deep in concrete
Defeat, bring up the fleet, flee 'fore we meet
Or stay away, puttin' new rhymes on layaway
Then come get this when you're ready for business
Cause aaaaah yeah, I'm with this (I'm ready)
Yo, Mister Cee, what is this?

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 3:

MC's and enemies I freeze at 32 degrees
Because they can't drop rhymes like these
Competition never saw none done
So pay attention as I mention the 411
Just the other day, I heard a brother say
"Taxi cabs don't even come my way
They all be afraid they won't get paid
So they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade
And if they stop, the first thing they want
No more than two people and the money up-front
Treatin' me like I'm some type of thug
It might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged."
Who's in the right or wrong? It's time to unite along
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like (Kid'N'Play)
Hey, even my man L.L. Cool J
(Stetsasonic) and EPMD
Public Enemy and (BDP)
Salt 'N' Pepa cause we can't sever never
Wheihter, whatever, we better stand together
That means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin'
One another cause separation is a flaw
So endure for more and stop lookin'; for....

(Repeat chorus 'till end)[Hook]
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
It's just the way I like it

[Verse 1]
I need a girl who ain't scared to scrap
Someone who got my back
Gotta be a dark skin a light skin
Like the type of girl that stays busy all day
But when the sun goes down, she's my sexy souffle
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work it
If you try to disrespect her face around and get her feelings hurt
She ain't ? from your ? ? ? ?
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous
She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip and when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight dinners from her mack
But she's a trooper if she has to spill the beans from the can
A very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy
And that's the way I like it, yeah, my black coffee

[Hook]

Black coffee got the flip like a mitten
Roars like a lion and when I stroke her kitten
Versatile when the coke gets mine
She got a positive style ain't had none in a while
Party animal but Biggie only when she with me
And I don't have to worry cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew she's all I talk about (hey)
Fancy here, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than a mob but don't touch her
Prettiest girl she know the ones with the slip
A closet full of gear so you know she stay ??
Body so smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some old sex potion
A nice girl but not mistaken for no softy
And that's the way I want it, yeah, my black coffee

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Break it down
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream

[Verse 3]
Black coffee, the African queen
Part of the Afro-American dream
Enough respect, I'm diggin' intellect
Appreciate the fact that you never miss a step
The backbone of the black bone here's to ya
As long as I'm around, believe me, none could ever do ya
You warm, considerate, and far from a softie
And that's why I love ya, you're my black coffee

[Hook]Chorus: Big Daddy Kane

Come on y'all and feel the groove
Get on down and make your move
Welcome to the funkiest
Brooklyn style, laid out like this

Chorus

[Big Daddy Kane]
I kicks the flavor good, to represent the neighborhood
Where I come from, and that's the place of Brooklyn
Where the grimies are born and bred
And bullets are like eyeballs, two to the head

[Scoob]
Well is it Brownsville? Time to represent for the map
Where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps
The party addict about to explode
From the 1-1-2, the double-3 ill zip code

[Big Daddy Kane]
Parlayin on the corner, drinkin 40's shootin cee-lo
It's a Brooklyn thing, aight? You know our steelo
And for those who just don't know how it go
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know

[Scoob]
So yo, who wanna set it? You better kick your best G
You and your whole entourage couldn't test me
I represent for the fo' main
And if you're not a booty bandit, then niggas can't hang

Chorus

[Big Daddy Kane]
Now, let's get straight down to the point
I represent for this Brooklyn joint, baby pah, where we're takin it to
Makin a few dollars don't mean you gotta forget
Where you come from and try to be someone, that you're really not
And front with what you got
You're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real
What type of mission can I say you on?
Because you musta done changed to some Grey Poupon, heh
I'm really happy to see you blew up
But always remember my man you grew up
In the PJ's all your life, in a broken home
(Scoob: Well alright now)
Up in the PJ's all your life, keepin it strong, WHAT!
I be the Louis Ave livin, live long lastin lover
Bonafied black brother, word to the mother
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made
The man with support and always stayed a fan
My dialectic style is perfected
In ways you can't imagine rap bein accepted
Funk'll slam like a doper jam, pops
I'm takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam
So check out the asiatic type of flow
Like water in the Nile, but it's Brooklyn style

Chorus

[Scoob]
Yo, this is Big Scoob, no practice
I'm flippin on niggas like little kids on that mattress
You know my style, Baby Pah from the PJ's
My lyrics so dope, they too fat for local DJ's
So hear me out, no doubt, no need for screamin
My boys in the back, clockin your jewels, and they scheamin
Why did they step to me, I hit em, bow, bu-dow
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile
No need for beef chief I'm rollin mad deep
So pick up your teeth, I got him shakin like a leaf
Not tryin to scare you, I just wanna aware you
I bet you won't even look at my face (WHAT WHAT WHAT) I dare you
Yo nigga please, yo I'm nice with these
While you're guardin your grill, I'll be beatin up your kidneys
Me and my boys with the fat tec 9's
With my joint cocked back, in case a punk tried to take mines
Where I'm from there's no need for hesitation
We cock and squeeze, now where's the doctor for this patient?
He's drippin blood and now he's down to his last breath
But he won't make it, cause he knows that my joint is def
The ill, type of Brooklyn artist
Who rocks the har-dest, regard-less
Who you know and where you're from I pull your file
(How?) Brooklyn style

Chorus[Hook]
The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

[Verse 1]
Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
"Hail Mary, full of grace"
Smack the bitch in the face, take her Gucci bag
And the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho
The head honcho, swift fist like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hitting the floor and me hitting the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker begging for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humping around and jumping aroundF
Jacked her then I asked her, "Who's the man?" She said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah, ya'll, a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in their drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self; from Brooklyn, where else?
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I ripped your troop
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop
What you think, I'm stupid?
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep

[Hook]Talkin bout drama

I met a young brother, how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him, and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeeahhhh boyyyeee, that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me
Cuz we are the victims, of a situation
How wicked man, seperated
A nation and got us cold-killin off one another
(Word-word, to the mother)
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
Cuz the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
*blam blam* and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin bout drama

Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
Cuz I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter, and out on the street
Without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
About some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's, five, below and we're ex-pecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues?
About you can't get a job, well, go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not wonderama
But I'm talkin bout drama
Hear what I'm sayin?
I'm not talkin bout your mama
Nahhhh, but I'm talkin bout drama

Shaolin fist versus the llama
Talkin bout dramaWord up, let me just fuck with your mind, please
Aiy! Aiyyo-yo-yo, yo! Let me fuck up your mind
On time, showin, you the, rhythm
As I get wreck and get raw
Yeah I be the man, comin off, that be raw
It's Busta Rhymes givin you much more
So...

Yo y'all (y'all) one more time I come
Knucklehead flow that make you act REAL DUMB
Yo (yo), I burn your food like Florence
Run up in your crib like my name was search warrants
Shut your mouth nigga don't you complain
Fix you up, mix you with cut like pro-caines
Ooh!! Insane to your brain
Right on your subconscious, I leave my SHIT stain
I be the mostest with rhyme overdoses
Hot stepping over shit like Ini Kamoze's
Sick lyrics like multiple sclerosis
Focus, while I display flows ferocious
Weak niggas just fall and keep tumbling
Distribute lyrics like I'm hand to hand herb hustling
Hardcore like Quick Draw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before

I make sure everything remains raw (4X)

Yo, when I step in the place I leave damages
Nuff bandages on pussy from miscarriages
Yo, watch me bring the newest recipe
Fuck you up quick and condemn you all with leprosy
Let me hit you with flows, that come various
Hahh, send you home and make you lie bout your alias
Ha-ha, niggas can't see my routine
When I round up my Flipmode niggas and get cream
Hey, you! You know what the fuck I mean
Now I'm on the scene, stepping through like Mean Joe Green
Now I'm making you feel the extreme
Till I black you out then turn on my real high beam
Oh shit, now I got your brains fried
Once you inhale smoke from my flow - CARBON MONOXIDE!
Use your imagination, let me take you higher
Rain hail snow earthquakes, Earth Wind & Fire
Yo, hit the dirt, get on the floor
I'm that outlaw nigga living right next door
You should just roll out the red carpet
All movin targets, I got you open like supermarkets
(Word up, word up) Yo yo, there's only five years left
While niggas is scared to death they breathe they last breath
Days of my Life goes on, word is bond
I make you feel my proton, neutron, and electron
Yo, I be the number one icon
Word to the holy Qu'ran, I rock on and on
On and on, hey, on and on and on
You won't understand when I form Voltron
Hahahaha, everything remains raw

* in background: I make sure everything remains raw * (7X)

Word is bond, niggas don't really understand shit
Niggas don't motherfuckin know y'all, hahah
Flipmode is the motherfuckin Squad y'all, hahah
I make sure everything remains raw, hahah
Word is bond, niggas don't know the real shit
There's only five years left! Word is bond
Niggas don't know though
There's only five years left! Hahah
Remember that nigga, all you, remember that
There's only five years left! HahahaI feel I'm a threat to high powered MC's
Cause when I roll up on their live shows they kinda freeze
From being approached by The Genius of rap
Whose poetry makes hands on a clock clap
You see, I be coming with strong rhymes galore
That even a stubborn MC can't ignore
That trying to defeat me brings about danger
Like a child speaking to a stranger
Soft MC's, I see more and more
With an ancient style, the prehistoric bore
Yes, they scream and roar until their throat get sore
Now they're running to the neighborhood drug store
To buy the cough drop for what? The wrong hip hop
Now they swear they're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop
POW!, now it's a six feet drop
For stealin' rhymes which is incorrect
Of those who speak on how others are weak
You wanna sneak peek of the hype technique?
Don't make me run up on start flipping like
I'm insane, or you'll feel the pain

I appreciate your comments of my creation
Your standing up followed by your standing ovation
Your kindliness to listen to the true MC
Those who know me make me #1 cause they agree
I rock on and on past the break of dawn
Ask Rakeem, Unique Ason, or even Melquan
Cause I be flowing at the same time showing
Hard headed individuals who don't be knowing
That I wreck it, cause my style was perfected
And injected into a drop beat selected
By who? Easy-Mo-Bee, the engineer
But don't forget the hypest in the Northern Hemisphere
The G, the, The G, the, The Genius
From Earth, not Mercury or Venus
Or Mars, cause then I'll be martian
But even in that world I'll still be squashin'
Brothers who feel they have the heart
To battle me, then I'll just trip them apart
Don't make me run up and start flippin' like I'm
Insane, or you'll feel the pain[Produced by Easy Mo Bee]

[Intro]
Yo Mack, I don't even understand how they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!

[Verse One]:
Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor be the badder chitter-chatter, madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my spit come out fatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MCs need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you and I bet the Mack take off like an MX missile
No more of your whining on the charts climbing
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhyming
I guess I'm gonna say Craig Mack with perfect timing
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Hook]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse Two]:
Craig Mack, 1000 degrees
You'll be on your knees
And you'll be burning, begging please
Brother freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MCs for dinner
You're crazy like that glue
To think that you could outdo my one-two
That's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
Cause boy, the rhyme you're kicking ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave
For the Mack the power pack in black making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Hook x2]

[Verse Three]:
Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MCs more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MCs shaking with this track that my man's making
Emcees'll run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MCs stop relaxing
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy watch the MCs I destroy and...

[Hook x2][Intro: Tenn Buick]

Tenn Buick
Come out and play
You know I had to do a remix, right?

[Verse: Tenn Buick]

Let’s take it back to rope chains and Uptowns
When wack MCs would get blazed and cut down
With rhymes so virile and raw, they could impregnate
When you cut a demo, man that shit was a cassette tape
Bumpin' out the walkman, all these fake thugs had to watch how they talk man
Say the wrong shit and get lined out in chalk man, it's real
They used to only take a cut of record sales when you had a record deal (what)
And I wanna hear a track with that crazy flow right
So I’m on the phone calling up the radio like
I don’t wanna hear bullshit, play some past hits
No bitch assness or get your ass kicked
They forgout about punchlines and sick rhymes
Got these zombies singin' hooks, somebody call Rick Grimes
Hip hop ain't dead, I think that I could save her
But we gotta turn the old school into the new flavor

[Hook: Craig Mack]

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

[Outro: Tenn Buick]

Yeah
Tenn Buick
I bring that old school back baby (what)
I spit that old school crack baby[Puff Daddy]
Bad Boys
Come out and play
You know we had to do a remix, right

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh, uh
Niggas is mad I get more butt than ash trays
Fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way
Ski mask way, nigga ransom notes
Far from handsome, but damn a nigga tote
(What you tote)
More guns than roses, foes is shaking in their boots
Invisible bully like The Gooch
Disappear, vamoose, you're wack to me
Take them rhymes back to the factory
I see the gimmicks, the wack lyrics, the shit is
Depressing, pathetic, please forget it
You're mad cause my style you're admiring
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring
You shoulda been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle you're bound to get shot
Not from Houston but I rap-a-lot
Pack the gat a lot
The flav's bout to drop uh

[Hook]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
Word up, no rap no crap you bore me
Wanna grab my dick, too lazy, hold it for me
I'm straight rap great
Busting heads, straighten dreads
I'm everlasting, like the toe on Pro Keds
A Tec-9 when I rhyme
Plus I climb, word is bond
Your album couldn't fuck with one line
It's been three years since you last hear
But now I reappear your heart pumps fear
To your gut, did your girl's butt
I scraped it, shaped it, now she won't strut
I smash teeth, fuck your beef, no relief
I step on stage, girls scream like I'm Keith
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rampage]
Twenty-one ninety-four
Mad motherfucking hardcore
It's my time to burn now explore
The flava in ya ear it's the boy scout
I make outs, I make other rappers have doubts
You're fucking with the wrong clan
And the wrong man, that's it
Now you got to get your dome split
I'm going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat, yes I'm just cool like dat
The dangerous, the ruggedness, from the Flatbush abyss
BLS 97 KISS bounce to this
I'm gonna live long in this rap game, niggas know my name
Yo Puffy

[Puff Daddy]
Burn 'em in the flames

[Interlude]
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Hee-shee, uh blowticious
Skeevee, delicious
Gimme couscous, love me good
Um damn, Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
I guess like the jeans - uh
Flavor like Praline, sick daddy nah'mean
Papa love it, when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It's all for you, it's really all for you
(Now what)
Hunchback, close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Flavors in your ass crease ha
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise don't cease ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast ha
Everybody, hey hey hey
You better believe it's Busta Rhymes the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State
Yo yo, hey hey hey
I'll split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious
I grant your wishes every time
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected is how we all connected
To break fool on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down I disappear, reappear and blow up
Everywhere, fucking with these flavas in ya ear

[Hook][Intro]
Fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my niggas know
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, Gucci Don, you know how we play
Fuckin scandalous-ass bitches; you know how it go, Gooch
I meet a bitch, fuck a bitch
Next thing you know you fuckin the bitch
You just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit
Fuck 'em

[Verse 1]
Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
Cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door
[You know] they might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said (Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?)
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch
[And you know that ain't right]

[Hook]
You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
(Yeah we know, drop the scenario)
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

[Hook][Hook x2]

My game's finesse
It's full of pain and stress
I train to press
And leave a pain in your chest
You came to test
My team is dangerous
You're playing the best
At the game of death

[Verse 1: Shaq]

Yo, and we gon get 40 milla to shoot to killa
Arena's filled to capacity to see this thrilla
(?) mystic, my style is supernaturally terrific
Non-believers y'all can check the statistics
I enter the dragon like I'm Bruce Lee
And next to the dragon like (?)
I run straight through your battlefield
Told you 'fore I made (?)
I'm fully loaded, get your crew (?)
How your rhymes overplayed and mines are diamond-coated
When I lace up to cock back, you better react to Shaq
Like "clear the room", if not - chick-chick-boom!
From here to Mekka, I'm know for nothing less
I sleep with one eye open and keep my joint on my dresser
From ashes to ashes and dust to dust
If you woke up (?), then you will get bust

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rakim]

My game is authentic, finesse with less floss in it
To the finish, my overall percentage off limits
Deadly radar, don't try to come outside and play y'all
My strategy's to set up or shoot out, slay y'all
Taught in New York, it's a contact sport
When we hold for it or get your contract cut short
It's perminent, injuries are nonperformative
Thought's a torture, terrify your team in a tournament
Me and Shaq react with a kill or be killed kind of attack
That's that, you can't come back
You get your frame swollen, left with your brain showin'
You came holdin', it got your whole game stolen
A franchise, kid you can't rise, it's the shot out
I shoot 'em down and blow your inside stuff out
Rakim remains the (?) on and planes
And I ignore the pain, because I love this game

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shaq]

I'm devoted to cash, rappin', basketball
After all I'm after y'all, smack you all, catch you as you fall
I fumigate that ass like fuel some gas, the blast will pass
I don't care who first or who last
My apparat is Dream Team 2 and 3 status
It's your choice of gettin' knocked, pop the lock, Shaq's the baddest
I represent the east coast, I ain't no stranger
When the Shaq is in the house - "O my god, danger!"

[Verse 4: Rakim]

It's an invite to the courtside, get your game right
Calm, not quite, it's nothin' of game tight
When I'm in flight, it makes me and Shaq the same height
Spark some mics, it's game time - aight
I turn colosseums into mausoleums of players
Who teams can't redeem themselves and try to spray us
Pain and stress, we do the same near the ref
I bet that I remain in the game of death

[Hook]AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Now who got the flav
That comes a dime a dozen
Thinking that is phat but wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack
(of Mackman)
Like Biggie Smallz might say
I eat'em shits like pac-man
I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables
Cause... I does what I do you
(Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin...macking ...full effect mike check one two
I'm a reign...rain forever
Rain like bad weather....reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style
Cause my style ain't a style
That is a style
So I can go buck wild
Betcha figure you got more funk for flow
It ain't so
Flava in Ya Ear letcha know
Now I'm about a second, from the Hook duk
Strap ya rap book
Before you get ya wet style shook

CHORUS
Can I get down
Get down
Get on down
Can I get down

The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MCs leaves a foul scent
See I'm like what ya call...king a yes ya'll
My style wreck shit...I mean real shit
Shit's thick..I come with the ammo
The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin
I wake great the lets warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to the stake
You sunk by domniate
See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buckus we roll with the cuf
No cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down....let me get down

CHORUS

To leap a tall building
Crush the earth-a-phone
But I'm sayin ain't no fair when MCs roam
The mic now in the right hands
Cause the Macks and the earths are the worthy of plans
More pep than the peppa thats in ya peppa shaka
Ruff earthquaker..couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring
With unknown to mad slang
With bigger bite than the double-bang
I ain't met boot to hand
If ya testin in ya lesson
Got me dressin for ya funeral session
Man.....It won't even matter no more
Craig in 94' just won the war
My style definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin look over in a four door Chevy Nova
(Why yi yi)
I figure its a slaughter
In the world of colins(?)
Ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter
The name of the track is Get Down
So let me Get Down and pound other MCs in the ground

CHORUS[Intro]
Yeah, mothafuckas better know
I'm a bad bad bad
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls

[Notorious B.I.G.]
My man Inf left a Tec and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G: you with me?

[Young Biggie]
Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest

[Notorious B.I.G.]
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'mma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

[Young Biggie]
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, it's so hard

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yes love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant

[Young Biggie]
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?

[Interlude]
When he's sticking you and taking all of your money

[Hook]
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad) [x4]
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
[x2]

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent

[Young Biggie]
Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip

[Notorious B.I.G.]
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, (yeah nigga, peel)
Before you find out how blue steel feel

[Young Biggie]
From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka

[Young Biggie]
So go get your man bitch, he can get robbed too

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

[Interlude]
Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch (when he's sticking you and taking all your money)

[Hook]

[Young Biggie]
Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh money looks sweet

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Where?

[Young Biggie]
In the Isuzu jeep

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar

[Young Biggie]
Ooh Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot

[Young Biggie]
Oh shit the cops

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts

[Young Biggie]
So why the fuck he keep looking?

[Notorious B.I.G.]
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucka going out for the loot

[Outro]

[Outro]
Take that motherfuckers[Verse 1]
When the la-la hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that your hat can't fit you
Either I'm with ya or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talking to the rap inventor
Nigga with the game tight, spit that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Getting head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women and the weed - sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see one
Sipping on booze in the House of Blues

[Hook]
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)  (x4)

[Verse 2]
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breast in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon stop, giving LA props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
Beeper start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whipping on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light
I'm set tonight
Met a bitch at the Versace store
Said she suck it 'til I ain't got no more, only in L.A
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State
Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite
Cali, great place to visit[Hook: Da Nation]
If you like what you see, make a move;
Get ya grind on, playa haters always lose
It's about fun, gettin' money, layin' in the cut
With everything you need, now what's up?

[Ras Kass]
It's the nigga you love to hate, '98;
Now how much cheese can one black nigga take?
Convertible Jag XK8 with customized plates
Playmates jumpin' out my birthday cake
See, we be on one, so raise the roof
Or we gon tear the club up, hoes in daisy dukes
I made you loose, orange juice mixed wit Hen tho';
I be doin' my thug thizzo, that's for shizzo
C-Arson baby, born and raised
Back in the KDAYs, when we was ba-bays
Now I get around like a circle
Squeezin' on ya lady's fat ass like a girdle
Latino cute, she was built somethin' fierce:
21, had her tongue and her bellybutton pierced
Playa, I think your wifey wanna politely bite me
Like Marv Albert, but that hurt, boo, blow lightly

[Hook: Ras Kass (Bad Azz)]
And all the ladies say
(Get your grind on, just get your grind on)
And all the hustlers say
(Get your grind on, just get your grind on)
And everybody say
(Get your grind on, just get your grind on)
And all the niggas say
(Get your grind on, just get your grind on)

[Ras Kass]
Let me take you back to the basics:
I smack a rapper's ass like a dominatrix
Life is screwfaces and misdemeanor cases
More chedda, the more better, family trump tight
Wit' my grandma dressin' all you chickens on fight night
I'm flossin' in Vegas like dream come true
Whippin' a '98 cream V 1-2
Of course, you be seein' me and one, two
I mean, three, laser-cut key, boo, one on Peachtree
One on Crenshaw, one on One Two Fifth
Walkin' in a B-Boy stance, holdin' my dick
I'm sick, flippin' scripts like Mxyzptlk on chicks
If they ridin' on my neezies like fleas and ticks
You need to just, catch us in the club, ten-drink minimum;
Freak 'em from the back, then I'm bendin 'em
And it don't stop, til the fat lady sing
But where Roseanne Barr at any way, know what I mean?

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Ras Kass]
A material girl in a material world
Read her lips from 'cross the crowd, she said, "Gimme a whirl."
But you can have a piece of my love tonight;

I gets my swerve on like DUIs
True lies between two thighs, no shame in my game;

Tryin' to take over the world like Pinky and the Brain

Gotta get a lot o' CHiPs like Eric Estrada

And gotta get a lot o' hits like a fly swatter
Kick it to upscale hoochies, the ones who wear a thousand-dollar dress
And still got five on the stress
Don't get it twisted — why you over there lookin' at me
If you ain't comin' home tonight? Let's get it on tonight
Blame it on the Alize, Moet, the chronic, the mic and strobe lights
Yeah, I'm knowin'
That's why women keep they panty lines showin'
Grindin', and grindin' and grindin' ...

[Hook][Verse One: Scrap Lover]
SURPRISE! Guess who's on the rise?
And competition, I'm takin, and breakin em down to size
I operate around the clock like city bus
Never take five, cause yo when you rest, you rust
Be advised, that I pack heat for beef
I'm knockin brothers out the box, and knockin out teeth
Twenty-one years young and I got the knack
(You got it!) to attack and scoop girls like a set of jacks
Ruff rhymes that rag any rap herb
Built by the best to bust swerves like a sharp curve
Fifty percent on wax, no matter of fact
Every nine out of ten rap acts produce a wack track
Twice as nice, but smooth as silk
Somebody writin for Scrap, is like givin a cow milk
I release, to make it hard for the fellas to cease
Cause I'm the type to make noise, I don't make peace
Here's a new jack, ready to SWING
And bring the hype type of freestyle rhyme for the crowd to sing
Some say there's a party, but it looks like a job to Scrap
I catch bodies with a nickel-plated rough rap
Me and ?Slap?, we run together through the city
The nitty gritty, always together like titties
By any chance that I do get burnt
You better believe that I'm comin back, just like a tax return

[Hook]
"Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap"
Here we go y'all! (6X)
"Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap"
Here we go!!

[Verse Two: Scoob Lover]
Move over to the side, let a slim brother wreck it
It's that Scoob Lover kid, so pull up a chair and CHECK IT
When I get wild like Heathcliff, or Dennis the Menace
It's like food to a fat man, finished
I bust your head like a apple (A APPLE)
And pour the blood in a jar, tell your moms that it's Snapple
And wait around my way for your crew, who's next
Cause I be lookin out my window with a nine like Malcolm X
There's no comp, they all got stomped so
Dream on.... dream away.... WELL OKAY!
And play like Shante, and Have a Nice Day
I drop rhymes that go boom (BOOM!)
And I can get funky like a high school locker room
Don't even think that I'm country country bamma
Scoob is hittin harder than a heavy heavy sledgehammer
I rock songs to make your grandmother dance
My rhymes are more together than a girl in biker pants
I'm never backed up, I never once had a fronter
Boy I get more beeps than a roadrunner *beep-beep*
I never sweat the girls when it comes to a phone call
I got things sewn up tighter than a football
So skip to my loo or get stomped by my crew
Brooklyn's in the house and ain't a damn thing new

[Hook]
"Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap"
Here we go y'all! (6X)
"Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap"
Here we go!!

[Verse Three: Big Daddy Kane]
Here comes the Prince of Darkness ready to spark this
And show the people just who is the hardest
Ruff and rugged, kind of similar to a nugget
But yet and still, I manage to keep the groove, smoove
Rebel for wreck them rappers I dissect them
Cause anything I say on the mic will affect them (HOW?)
So bad, they gotta run for shelter
So rappers take flight like they work for Delta
They know I ain't havin it, styles with no crab in it
Fakin and flakin it child, you're sadly mistakin
Cause who's a rapper here that Kane rip on the mic
And start flowin *ZOOM* Yo yo yo, where you goin?
That's how they flee from me, the B, the I-G
Damn man, you know my pedigree, huh
The gangsta, murdera, killa to ya
For sure endure to injure him or her
The breaker the taker money-maker never a faker
My lyrics are built like Schwarzaneggar
So all my competition gets destroyed
You need to put your weak rhymes on steroid
For you to ever to press up on the mightiest man
To rip a show and flow, provin that competition CAN'T GO
Because I do all, it's easy for you to fall
I move all rappers like my name was U-Haul

[Hook]
"Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap"
Here we go y'all! (6X)
