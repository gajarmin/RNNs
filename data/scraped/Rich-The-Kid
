[Hook - Lil Uzi Vert]
I turn five to a ten

Forty forty hit your woadie shorty
Balmain, Saint Laurent with the Fendi
I turn five to a ten

Fourty fourty hit your woadie shorty
Balmain, Saint Laurent with the Fendi
Whatchu want, tell me whatchu want (What do you want?)
Like whatchu want, like what do you want?
Whatchu want? Let a nigga know
Let a nigga know, let a nigga know

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
You get hit, 40'll hurt you
I got your bitch on me, your mama on me and she birth you
Blowin' Uzi, I'm just off the shits
Got your bitch on me, she all all on the dick
I get so turnt up, countin' these bands bands
I don't give a mothafuck, I am the man
Stay down with mad niggas, your girl my baby
I'm fuckin' on, I am too lazy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Fergy gonna get 'em, youngin' doin' better
Uzi with Uzi hit him through the leather
Black Panther party, Huey with the leather
Feel like I'm him with the cheddar
Put 'em in the soup, portobello
Hit him in the head through his cerebellum
Nigga better tell him my uncle OG with a motherfuckin' felon
He'll dead him in a second if I tell him
Spoke to Number Nine 'fore he went to jail and
He was on his way to his dreams
Then his dreams started derailing from a weapon
These kids I try tell 'em
Don't get caught with the weapon
Hip Hop police on the 'Gram
And they can't wait to get 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Trap, he smoking on midnight gas
Finessing a nigga with pounds of the swag
My bitches, they bustin', you niggas, you cuffin'
I trap out the bando, them onions
Whatchu want, whatchu want, my nigga?
I booted them Xans, wrappin' the bricks in saran
You don't want problems
Bitch I got choppers, Afghanistan
Migo Gang, A$AP Mob, he might fuck around get robbed
30 gold chains I flex, but I ain't ever had no job
Turn twenty to a fifty
Tryna jump at Rich the kid, diamonds dancin' like Diddy
I trap in the kitchen with Whitney, Actavis killin' my kidneys

[Hook][Hook: Rich The Kid & Fetty Wap]
I gotta keep it 100
Bitches, they fuckin' for nothin'
Pull up in my truck in the front
Rich but I started with nothin'
I'm in the trap with a bad bitch
Had to go flood out my whole wrist
Too many cars in the garage
I'm thankin' Allah
These niggas, they fake and they fraud

I gotta keep it 100
Most of these niggas is bluffin'
I hit 'em man, they be frontin'
They do not keep it 100
Shootin' at niggas in broad day
My niggas they trap out the hallways
This money shit, we get it all day
I keep it 100, as always

I gotta keep it 100
Bitches, they fuckin' for nothin'
Pull up in my truck in the front
Rich but I started with nothin'
I'm in the trap with a bad bitch
Had to go flood out my whole wrist
Too many cars in the garage
I'm thankin' Allah
These niggas, they fake and they fraud

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Most of these niggas, they snakes
I sip the lean, pour a 8th
So many diamonds the bezel won't break
I know that your Rollie is fake
These bitches gon' fuck, can't trust 'em
I can turn nothin' to somethin'
How many times have I told you?
I'm trappin' the block
I'm servin' in front of the cops
I talk about Rari's, I'm flexin' in them
I don't got no friends
I gotta go get them M&Ms
I got Juelz like Dipset and 'em
Bitch you lyin', ain't got no time
Beginning was broke but now I got cash
I'm gettin' to the money, the fuck is you mad?
I might just go break in her bag

[Hook: Rich The Kid & Fetty Wap]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I gotta keep it 100
ZooGang the camp, Zoovier, I run it
And I came up from nothin'
I'm livin' good, my bitches love me
Niggas after my money
I introduce 'em to my Tommy
Keep my shooters close to me
You can never run behind me
I be rollin' that dope
Sack like a mothafuckin' zombie
I been juugin' so good
Might drop a 100 on my time piece
And we keep it 100
I don't want no awards
I don't want no Grammy's
You get left for a check
Boy I just hope you understand me
(squad)

[Hook: Rich The Kid & Fetty Wap][Intro: ILoveMakonnen]
I'mma teach you how to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it
How to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it
How to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I do a cooking class on every Thursday
Parking lot at 6' o'clock jumpin' like a church place
I do a driving class on every Sunday
Turn a little Ferrari into a pretty Hyundai
They don’t know this new shit we on
We don’t really give a fuck when we in that zone
We blowing strong and gas at least, by the zone
I got bitches all night calling on my phone
Drinking lean all the day and plus I smoke with the wax
A little young nigga like me speak nothing but facts
I got them bitches out of town pulling up in a Cadillac
Smoking so much weed cause my grandma got them cataracts

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
But my friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Migos and Makonnen keep the blue Benjamins only
Trapping OG gas out the hotbox, and it’s stolen
I can teach you how to whip a whole thing
Hundred percent, that is cocaine
Young nigga kicking it like Liu Kang
Money coming back to me like boomerang
Teach me how to whip it, I got birds singing like Whitney
I can show a nigga how to make a million
I can show a nigga how to stash in the ceiling
I got the club going up, that was on a Tuesday
One phone call to the plug, he on the freeway
I can teach a nigga how to touch down on a plug just for a half a milli
I can teach a nigga how to pour a four of the muddy trouble cause I’m purple sipping
I can teach a nigga how to grab a chopper with extensions, spray the block with no intentions
I can show you just how to be real with you
If you’re pussy then nigga can’t deal with you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Teaching your bitch how to whip it
Kitchen, I cook up the Bentley
Bando, I made me a milli
Bitch, I had birds in the ceiling
These niggas snakes, that’s what Quavo told me
Got blue Benjamins, went and bought a Rolex
Whip a brick with the baking soda
Rich nigga trap off a Motorola
Come to the block, we got quality
Breaking my wrist, tryna whip a key
I was 12 with a felony
Sipping lean, that promethazine
I fell in love with the codeine
Young rich nigga, plenty chains on me
This how you whip up the coca
Remix the brick, then you flip it over

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Offset]
Teach me how to whip
In the kitchen cooking, no Jiffy
Made a quarter milli off of selling biscuits
Fucking with the brick, you need a tissue
Sold ten birds on Tuesday
Loubotin kicking, your bitch brought me kisses
I get more head than a toupee
I can be your tutor, baking soda, watch how I do it
In the lab, cooking the slab, stretch it ho, make it long as a ruler
I got niggas and they got on your medulla
Bottle like a cobra, hit em with the cooler
Rapped for three years and we made a lot of improvement
Don’t be a hater, nigga get with the movement
Used to be a nuisance riding with the ruler
On the Molly, booted, and I ran in to go use it
Nigga got a juug then I’m not gonna refuse it
Tryna rob a nigga without a strap, nigga you are foolish
Looking at my diamond confused, is it fluid?
Out of town bags, but you know a nigga flew em
Skippa da Flippa, he dropping bricks of at Newmans
Plug is an alien, my plug not a human

[Hook][Hook: ILoveMakonnen] x5
Mama called me on the phone, ask me if I'm still trappin'
I'm like, "No ma'am"
Heard the house still boomin' and you're still gift wrappin'
Know I won't slow down

[Verse 1: Rome Fortune]
Aye, Mama said you're goin' too fast, nigga slow down
Ain't seen a red light, no po-po 'round
Your ho 'round, she go down, she low down, she low down
Spend the night with me? Hell no, no ma'am
I just wanna live life
Fuck it, you can spend night
Fuck it, live a big life
Fuck your best friend's wife twice, yes
Hopped up in the Benz like twice, yes
Turn two times to a thrice, yes
Too much cheese for your mice
Two piece for you bitch, yes
Oh she fill the sheet, sheet, sheet
Oh she finna cheat, cheat, cheat
Oh she fill the sheet, sheet, sheet
My phone ring, now momma!

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen] x4

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Mama called me on the phone, asked me if I'm still trappin'
I take your bitch but you don't know what happened
Mothafuck 12, I've been ridin' with a chopper
It's about to go down
Flooded my Rollie, I'm droppin' a hundred
Niggas, they mad cause I'm rich, I got money
Swerve in the 'Rari, ain't slowin' down
Trappin' and trappin', got  plenty pounds
I was layin' in the bed with three bitches
Groupie hoes like the feds, take pictures
Still trappin', lil' nigga, my money up
Rich and Makonnen, we whip it up
Trap jumpin' so I'm still in the kitchen
I got hoes butt naked cookin' fishes
Lotta Os on the check cause I'm winnin'
Me and mama ridin' 'round in a Bentley

[Intro: Quavo]
Yo, nice to meet you
Adios

[Hook: Quavo]
We taking trips, on the islands
My bitch bad, she from the islands
Where the plug? He on the islands
No Gilligan, I'm on the islands
Splash, drip, islands
Water, islands
Splash, drip drip, lots of islands
Living on the islands

[Verse 1: Quavo]
On the islands cooling like Gullah Gullah
I'm independent I ain't trying to sign to Warner Brothers
We'll take ten mil' for a Label deal
And I don't want the PT if it ain't Double Seal
Life is a gamble game, wrist still a hurricane
In a Audi getting brain, swerving in the other lane
They wanna fuck with me cause I'm a millionaire
Spectacular, the choppas in the back and in the Frigidaire
You don't even wanna bust a move, come on my fleet
Got them on stand-by on snooze, stand-by my fleet?
I just pushed the button and you lose, you lose my fleet?
POW!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got dreads like I'm from the islands
Smokin' weed like I'm from the islands
I just met a bad light-skinned bitch on Highland
I'ma get some brand new pussy tonight
Dolla Sign and Migos we the trendsetters
Pushaz Ink the label we the trendsetters
That's yo' bitch, on God, she was just with us
That's yo' bitch, tonight, nigga don't kiss her
Rum and coke, she drink piña colada
I only smoke kush, these niggas still on the chronic
Met a red bone, in bikini bottoms
Look just like Rihanna, say she from the islands

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
My bitch from the islands I covered her in diamonds
The haters can't stop me from shinin'
Don't play with me nigga, Machete will hit you
Young nigga you know that I'm Haitian
I had to stay down while we trappin' the vacant
Mama she said we would make it
Feels good to be rich
Got a jet, take a trip
Fuck nigga we made it !
The plug on the islands, no Gilligan
I pull out my wallet, finessin' him
I be with the migos, no Mexican
I'm a young rich nigga
I'm buying whatever no matter the cost
Yo' boyfriend about to come fuck with a boss
I ride in a Maybach, no Ross

[Verse 4: Offset]
Welcome to my island
Lions, bears, and tigers
Selling babies, cooking toddlers
Bad bitches givin' knowledge
Welcome to my land
Molly santan' kickstand
Choppas on deck like Iran
Whippin' and flippin' them candy yams
On the islands, no Gilligan
You niggas are sweeter than Cinnamon
I run to the money with energy
My loafers are 'gator amphibians
Rocca been trappin' for centuries
How the hell you don't know Benjamin ?
You run up on me it's a penalty
His pack went missin', a mystery

[Hook][Intro]
Turn me up Josh, Josh engineering
Migo! Wooh!
I'M RICH!

My diamonds is dancing
I pull up in Phantoms
I trap out a mansion
My bitches they come cross the border
They naked no bra or no panties
I fly with a fish & i fly with a fish
And I whip and I'm breaking my wrist
My ice from the glacier
I'm sipping the Lakers
I'm rich like the mayor
Fuck a nigga's feelings, bitch I'm rich, I don't give a damn
I just fucked a nigga baby momma off of Instagram
Trapping and trapping it turned into rapping
I don't even know how it happened
The money is coming in an orderly fashion
Young nigga I'm capping and trapping
Flipping the work wit' no spatula
Pull up in 'Rarri, I'm crawling tarantula
My nigga got choppers, berettas and uzis
I promise they'll damage ya
Migo gang, pull up flexin' 30 chains
Lamb no brains, got it off of cocaine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
How does it feel to be broke?
White diamonds like coke
Wrapping the brick up like mummies

[Hook][Hook: Rich The Kid]
Pull up in a Bentley, flexing, wearing 20 chains
Spent a hundred up in Neimans that ain't nothing but change

Spilling lean on my Robins cause I had to change

[Verse 1: Migo Bands]
The money didn't change me and I'm rich and I'm famous, yea it just made me more dangerous
Hop fresh out the banana boat with the dope and it sell like a rope like in slavery
Im fucking the bowl, wrist out of control, Quavo told me whip that lil' baby
Tokyo diamonds on African gold im serving like Mitch in the 80's
The Bentley the color of gravy, I whip Mercedes damn and potatoes
Popping the seal like I beef with the navy, 22 chains on the back of your lady
That brand new Mulsanne watch me crome through in the thang' I'm in it and I blew out the brain
I'm gone need both of these lanes I leave with yo ho cause she know you a lame

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Young rich niggas, still pulling up with pistol
Young rich nigga fuck it so I bought a missile
Twenty chains on me he only took one, got goons on the hunt that do it for the fun
Walk in the bank, a hundred thousand on my waist
A nigga thought I had a fucking bomb
I put it the Nawf on the map, we make the bando the trap
I put the work in her hands, she boomerang money bring it back
Got twenty chains on when I serve ya, look at the coupe it just came out of surgery
You want a zip nigga? That's just for me
Nigga hit my phone when you want a whole P

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Sipping and spilling the lean, I'm living the dream, my chopper got infared beams
Twenty chains on it's a half in my jordans, bitch from Bermuda she trapping in Beverly
I'm stashing the bands in the basement, my shooters they aim at your faces
Whipping up work in a vacant, walk in the trap you can taste it
She say I got too many chains on, some niggas they say that I changed on 'em
Fuck what you saying, my diamonds they kill like they came from Japan
Got plenty of gas in the back of the Bentley, I'm flexing again
Way more chopper than a Pakistan, still in the kitchen with bitches we ain't playing

Young rich nigga catching serves out the Lamb
I’m sticking to the script, you get script if you get caught stealin'
I fell in love money, I done think I had no feelings
Count it up, count it up, looking at the calendar

Word on the street if the plug serve me then we ain’t seeing no drought

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Mango Foo]
Mango the fool, I’m draped up in jewels

My diamonds they wet like a pool
You tryna take 'em, Fox 5, make the news
I got money like I work at a bank
OG gas bags all in the trap, got it stank
Got a knife on the end of the rifle, get shanked
Hit the water with the baking soda, fuck around and faint
Got a whole lot of money
Trapping and capping I don’t have a budget
Underarm kush got the whole club musty
Say your nigga real shooter but your gun clip rusty
I come from the dirty like rugby
Rode around, tryna call me Benny cause I been had hundreds
In the kitchen whipping like George Foreman
I bring it back like it’s karma
OKC the trap, we hit a nigga with the thunder

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Rich The Kid]
All this money, got too many hundreds
Only big fish and my bitch count twenties
Mango, go hit em with the K though
Fuck around and leave your brain gone
Big chase, big money
Bunch of our shoes cost 15 hundred
More chains, more ice
Might blind your bitch, that’s on my life
Young rich nigga from the bottom
Made it from the bricks, you know we got 'em
Hundred band cash on my Rolex
Call Migo Bands, hit 'em with the carbon
But your bitch can’t whip it like me
Ain’t talking bout Alicia, got Keys
Nigga I’d rather be rich than famous
Fuck your ho one night, bitch in Vegas

[Hook][Intro]
I pray the god for forgiveness
All the jewels I caught
Ion' know I ain't blessed

Everything gold, I’m a gold member
Six rings on, I got gold fingers

And I got these bitches leaking when I’m speaking baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Young Thug]

How many times have I told you that Thugga got rich off a sentence?
How many times have I told you I look like an Indian ribbon?
How many times have I told you that I would say you were the remedy?
How many times have I told you that I would eat you like Denny's?
No JC, I buy her Penny's

Oops I meant fuzzy, I pray that bitch is my bousin (Suwoop!)
You pray that bitch is my cousin, and then she say that we dirty

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Young Dolph]
Breaking down bales of tree early in the morning
Garbage bag full of grass like I just mowed the lawn
Got a super plug, so I got super power
I feel like Austin Powers, real gangsters move in silence
Doing 150 in the coupe, I just love the rush
It’s a cold world we live in, and so in my chopper I trust
100 shots I bust, 100 pieces of Reggie on that fucking Greyhound bus
I feel like MC Hammer, I can’t be touched
He tried to trap me but he broke, so it can’t be much
Hating get you nothing, money bring you Austin Power
I swear these niggas just like this blunt, man these niggas sour

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]

Back then she ain't like me now I'm rich now
In the kitchen water whippin' break a brick down

[Hook][Hook]

[Verse 1]
Bitch wanted diamonds from Tiffanys

Young nigga had to grind for the cash
I swerve in the Masi, my haters is mad
Pussy so good I fall asleep in it
Counting blue hundreds, I wake up
I bought her a Rolex and took her to Jacobs
Sipping on Actavis, two cup

Kitchen, she be cooking in the morning
Bitch not mine like Maury
Diamonds they hitting like Bruce Lee
Young, she fucking anybody
Bitch I be running from paparazzi
Geeked up, I got her on the Scotty
Major my chef is cooking hibachi
Your watch fugazi, can’t trick me
My diamonds they AG
She want to ride with a young rich nigga
Putting 3 5 in the swishers
I’m smoking on nothing but OG gas
Bitch so bad I’m dropping the cash
She love when I smash
We walking through Lennox with plenty bags

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can’t put no ring on that finger
Look at my chain and your eyes are in danger
Got a bad bitch with a banger, always keep one in the chamber
Don’t trust these hoes what mama keep telling me

You cuff em and keep em in custody
Look at my neck I got too many chains on me
Dropping and topping the roof, I got the juice
Bitches they fuck in the coupe
She said she don’t fuck with the molly I know that shes taking a boot
I walk in this bitch, they pull out the camera
They taking the pics, look at my wrist
Young nigga came up from the bricks, I got your ho on my dick
Keep kissing these strippers on the mouth
How he take that ho to the house
My money so tall, can’t count
Bitch ass so fake, can’t bounce
I’m on the way to the island
Fingers are flooded with diamonds
Imma get money regardless
I’m sipping the syrup in the morning

[Hook][Hook: Rich The Kid]
Young nigga came from nothing, got it out the gutter
Had to go and get it, tired of bread and butter
Was raised in the streets, I barely seen my mother
Young nigga came from nothing, got it out the gutter

Young nigga came from nothing, all I know is hustle

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Young rich nigga came from the very bottom

Spilling lean on my Robins cause I had to change

[Verse 1: Migo Bands]
The money didn't change me and I'm rich and I'm famous, yea it just made me more dangerous
Hop fresh out the banana boat with the dope and it sell like a rope like in slavery
Im fucking the bowl, wrist out of control, Quavo told me whip that lil' baby
Tokyo diamonds on African gold im serving like Mitch in the 80's
The Bentley the color of gravy, I whip Mercedes damn and potatoes
Popping the seal like I beef with the navy, 22 chains on the back of your lady

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Young rich niggas, still pulling up with pistol
Young rich nigga fuck it so I bought a missile
Twenty chains on me he only took one, got goons on the hunt that do it for the fun
Walk in the bank, a hundred thousand on my waist
A nigga thought I had a fucking bomb
I put it the Nawf on the map, we make the bando the trap

Got twenty chains on when I serve ya, look at the coupe it just came out of surgery
You want a zip nigga? That's just for me
Nigga hit my phone when you want a whole P

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Sipping and spilling the lean, I'm living the dream, my chopper got infared beams
Twenty chains on it's a half in my jordans, bitch from Bermuda she trapping in Beverly
I'm stashing the bands in the basement, my shooters they aim at your faces
Whipping up work in a vacant, walk in the trap you can taste it
She say I got too many chains on, some niggas they say that I changed on 'em
Fuck what you saying, my diamonds they kill like they came from Japan
Got plenty of gas in the back of the Bentley, I'm flexing again

Rose Rolex, eating pork rinds
Aquaberry diamonds froze the hands of time
Codeine pouring with the purple swans
I’m playing hackey sack in the valet parking at Hakkasan
Neon swim shorts, I don’t play sports
The way I ball, I burn through money like a Newport
Mentos seats, and the paint orange
Should I sip codeine, or should I sing a chorus?
I got an all star team, but I’m running late
I got talk show dreams, like I’m Ricky Lake
Yeah you can’t tell me nothing, you can tell I’m stunting
Who woulda knew I’d have Versace jewels across my tooth[Intro]

[Verse 3 – Takeoff]
Coming down Peachtree in the Aston
With a bad white bitch, Jennifer Aniston
Feeling Molly Santan’ again
My neighbors panicking
In my hood, every day I hear an ambulance
Ain’t a damn thing changed, still serving the J’s
Felicia, she want to borrow my microwave
Deebo still in the hood, creeping through your window
I’m fucking Mrs. Parker, took her to Puerto Rico
Me, Craig, and Smokey smoke dope and we be choking
Which watch should I wear today, the heavy Breitling or the Rollie?
Reached in my Robins and I pulled out guacamole
Ain’t have a clue what I was holding, F&N is what I’m toting

[Hook]
