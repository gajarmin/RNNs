[Intro]
OK.. got some for me?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once innocent and sweet
14 introduced to the street
Started from weed, big smoke outs
Before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
Now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
Introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
Plate on the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
You see the big girls do it so of
Course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blow in ya time
Let's go

[Hook]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo

[Verse 2]
Chompin and compin Supplying people with they fix
Where you fit?
Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
Not too much cuz you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat in the pack in the side
Take a couple of tubes, then its back to the block

Back to the service out the sack
Experimenting with that salt, what about that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
Papered out, always at the powder house
Day time, night time, nigga part it out
Could've been a papered-out powerhouse

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Like you and I, super high, like superfly
One more line, one more rhyme like Peruvian fine
I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? Like Boston George?
You want some more, for you and your whores?
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
And corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man, high, eight balls and quarters
They call me, placing they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the case
Before I'm sold, they take the taste
Snortin, have it, not worth affordin
Some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doing my job, connected wit the mob
Got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night[Hook:]
For those who come to San Francisco
For those who come to San Fran... Fran

In, in, in, in to the streets of San Franciscccco

It's a city situation, I keep Hunters Point
In thee equation

And you gon need a doctor to play with my patients
You hatin, you'll get it in broad day
My neck shines like the lights on Broadway
Never gave a broad away
Cause in Filmore they'll get it to pay
But HP, that be me
Check my street cred
I'm in the trap all day
(all day, all day)
I just count the cash
Now my whip wet like Alcatraz
And not one bars of fable
We got the cable car, but my car got cable
Boo Banga, I'm on demand like comcast
And with these squares, I don't contrast

[Hook:]

Then its down to Texas, Houston and Dallas
Where my blunts they roll the fattest
Hate the Cowboys, despise the Rockets

Hit New York like a Giant, the swings are back
No trust, no sleep, gotta bring my gat
Lookin for the king of rap, so I can take the crown
Then I slide to the next town

Puff some real dro' before I go back to Spokane
And catch my plane to Chicago

Never move illegally, from there to Tennessee
Rollin up a Titan, sippin on some hennessey
It goes down, mo' brown in Cleveland
Ass round titties big gimme head this evenin

Oh don't ask why (old b-z back the fuck away)
Oh don't ask why

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]

Big titties
Big booty
Betsy
She was only 17 but she was sexy

And then there's Becky
18 and a half-er
She run like donner, rudolph, and prancer
No, I didn't have to romance her
But once I caught her
I couldn't shake her like cancer

And oh yeah nigga'
What about Ilene
She a fiend but she only nineteen

20 year old Claire and her best friend Blair
They square but they came as a pair

Show me the way to the next little girl
No 89 earthquake bitches for Furl
I don't want nothing old but the money
A Tina Turner bitch can't do nothing for me
Punk rock?
I'm mac dreazy
Show me the way to the next young b-z

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why

[Verse 2: Smoov-E]

I knew it was wrong boy
I had to risk it
To bang the biscuit
Little old Triscuit

7, 5, and 3 zeros
That's my bail
I need Shapero

I was just having some fun in the telly
No bandaid like Nelly but bang like R kelly
Really, you heard what I said
Now you punk ass wishin' I wouldn't of done what I did

Lacy, Stacy and the little ol' Haitian
'Smoov-E a sex offender and he on probation'

Don't run your mouth dog
Keep it cool
Got to drop this girl off
In front of the high school

These hot ass bitches
Is barely legal
I'll be serving life sentences
For three damn people

Perky ass titties
Thick old thighs
I slipped a girl a Mickey
Your hand full of black flies

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

[Verse 3: San Quinn]

Young bitches at the high school
Flossing my riches
I'm so cool

12th graders at least
18 years of age
20 minutes or less
In the Escalade

Looking at the tv
Porno flickin' it
She grabbin' it
Telling me to stick it in

10 inching it
Infinite hitting it
She want to fuck another girl
Ask could I fix it up

Away away
To the junior college
All the bitches love the Escalade
To my knowledge

Sure enough, pulling up
Bumping a little beat
Pull a clydesdale slut from the middle east

She's looking too worthy (too worthy)
Off two ecstasy pills and it's daytime
Only 2:30

Hop in, hop in
She's singing 'ayo for yayo'
But she's saying I'm not quinn (what!)

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way to the next little girl

Show me the way to the next little girl[Hook: Scott McKenzie - San Francisco sample]

[Verse 1: Big Rich]

Rep' my city, nobody flyer

Got a block full of hitters everywhere I go
Say you from the hood, but you never lived though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Boo Banga]

It's a city situation

And you gon' need a doctor, you play with my patience
You hating, you can get it in broad day
My neck shines like the lights on Broadway
Never gave a broad away
Cause in Fillmore they get it to pay
But HP, that be me
Check my street cred, I'm in the trap all day
I just count the cash
Now whip bent like Alcatraz
And not one bar's a fable
We got the cable car, but my car got cable
Boo Banga, I'm on demand like Comcast
And with these squares, I don't contrast

[Hook]

[Verse 3: San Quinn]

City go by no book, anybody get took
From HP to Hayes Valley we push
Come over the top of the bridge
It gets narrow
Grip roll down riding on O'Farrell
Young Fillmore Fa-rel, Golden Gate treasure
Down in the Wharf, SF the letters
Roll in like fog, battle's up hill
You witness shit you will get killed
Coughnut, Mr. C, Hitman, R.I.P
Much love from the SFC
Handle bricks in the back of Candlestick

Still with the cannon, 40 or 50 Caliber
Five time champion, destroy any challenger
Hit like Barry, Score like Jerry
Still right here, Fillmore to marry

[Hook]Chorus 2x *(Messy Marv)*

All my niggas in the ghet-ta
Acceptin no losses, no cheats an no let downs
Foul cats mess around get the wet down
In yo city
Leave yo whole turf shut down
(Sucka What Now?)

Verse 1 *(San Quinn)*

It's lethal
The streets'll take ya where ya don't need to go
Ammunition
Bullet proof
Ghetto blastas slammin roofs
Straight loot an pursuit
To survive be bout politics
We not ruthless for suckas it's bound to make me contradict
Conflict of intrest
Because my Mobb is relentless
Suckas don't wanna see us in this or win this
Splended
Less suckas to worry bout
Broke niggas make the best crooks
Crossas an killas
More scrilla I accumulate
Enough to feed my reals
Not concerned about the murder rate so when I'm a get drilled
I be prayed up
Over raw
Wakin up's enough for me
But when I rhyme my minds on the grind
Strictly hustlin
I'm back to bust
It should be lavishly surroundin
Naturally reboundin from the loss cuz you thought I was grounded
This how we do it
The truth gets screwed gets ???
Me retire, the file wit ridas that remain at

*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 2 *(Messy Marv)*

Bow down to the west world
In the bucket flossin wit yo best girl
Wanna turn up in the pearl
Now you muggin when you rollin by
Wanna get wet by the Tech cuz you lookin dry
Seen the hate up in yo eye
Be on the flight the next mornin
Suckas flex in Kanas, Seattle an Oregon
I got game
Doin thangs in 25 states
No condition we straight
Ammunition we hate
Kept it up in the case
Gangsta
In body armor
We rappers say "This is fake" when people's quick to bomb on ya
An bet a dime on ya
Befo' ya make a false move
Then get lost in yo crew
Now they all boo-hoo
Ya stay in doo-doo
Fucked around an got flushed
Out of line
Out of time
Thinkin you can't be touched
We quick to rush
Cuz suckas sit in concrete and calmly
Blow bomb-diggy on my way back to the big city

*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 3 *(San Quinn)*

Respect
We check the neck
You next
Seff an Mess
Elliot finess
At yo front steps, God bless
Lyrics you fearin no non-sense we far fetched
Leave you outlined stretched
Wit yo mind wrecked
I Rolex, you Timex
Watchin time tick
If it rhyme hit yo target sucka
Accurate
My limits
Have no maximum
Mashin 'em
Runnin down the platinum
Half of 'em rappin
I be surpassin 'em
My squad do the job
Let them do rappin
They rob
We gon' survive
While you dispise
Frisco playas live
Eyes wide scopin
Hopin we ain't touchin
Then we high rollin
High side wit our mouths open
Gold showin
I'm representin the playas an pimps
Playin simps
Pursuin mill tickets, bangin my hits
Still we kill 'em this is like 11-Feev (11/5)
Keep it real like the 6-9 Vill you suckas best believe

*(Chorus)* 4x[Intro]
OK.. got some for me?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo

Doing my job, connected wit the mob
Got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night[Hook]
I'm always drunk in San Francisco [X6]

[Verse 1: San Quinn]
It's a staring artist, in need of racks
You heard him too? I'll drink to that
Sittin' at the beach, drinking like a fish
Fit the privilege, arguing with my bitch
She said I need to quit, or find another groupie
Then she took the car, made me ride the munie
Bottle gone, at the bus had to hobble on
Like a real wine-o, gettin' my wobble on
End of the market, busy drunk talking to the homies
Listen tellin' Lauren diggin' in the garbage
Fuck, like I'm not a star
Lookin' for another card, free ride on the cable car
From brown to white, China Town on the hype
Patron shot after shot, no water and Sprite
Lookin' for a fight, runnin' up on tourists
Not too aware, but I'm for sure, ripped
See me on one, let me be me
You better calling SFPD

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tuf Luv]
What time is it? what day it is?
How the hell I end up it the baby crib?
I don't drink much, but when a nigga do
I get drunker than a pirate in a sailor suit
I'm on a bar with a bottle in my back pocket
Me and Paul Masson, just left crackin'
We about to go kick it with Brandy
Her and her little sister Landy
At 11:45, at my pier at 39
Had the bar at a dime, with a beer and a lime
Somebody try to draw the line I try to stop the cakes
Soon as the bottle hit my lips I'm like Frank Buttes
Drunk at the curb, askin' for my money back
Slurring words, yelling "what the look you fuckin' at"
Now everybody lookin', like ain't that a bitch
I'm at the 'Niner game, in that Raider fit
At the Giant's game, in that A's hat
When people flip me off, I just wave back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Yeah, I know the club owner, I like to rub on her
I'm in the crib with 3 shots and a cold Corona
I run laps like the 500 Daytona
Tell I find fine women, wanna know my persona
Then I'm on her like a light switch
The right bitch, that'll try to fuck a dyke bitch
I take her out to Candlestick
Get another 50cs she can handle with
That nigga B-Le, he be on that black
Cognac, Hennessy, yeah he fuck with that
I seen him at the Glass Cat
Gettin' splat at the back, it was hella racks
And, boy if you only knew
What I do, when I ride through them avenues
I'm talkin' 21, 22
My heels on, she about 6 in the few
I let them know what the thing do
We brought our shoes on so it cool, baby, act a fool

[Hook][Hook]
We go hard, we go hard
We go hard, we go hard
We go hard, we go hard(Mistah F.A.B: Yeah)
We go hard, we go hard(Mistah F.A.B: uhuh)
We go hard, we go hard(Mistah F.A.B: uh)


[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B]
You wanna see somebody go hard
Hit the grind king, 25/8
I'm hustlin'
My grind big

State to state, flying planes
Boats, Cars, Trucks, Trains
No sleep, no rest
Yeah, I'm on my grind mane

My motivation, inspiration, to the nation
Never lose focus when adversity you facing, uhh
Go hard, like algebraic equations
Scientific philosophy, psychology are ages

Obstacle and controversy's are minor setbacks
Live life to the fullest and never regret that
Take no days off, continue to build
Even if you gotta mill, it's no time to chill

Complacency is mental slavery, uhh
Go hard, stay hungry and humble, that's what you made be, uhh
Cos that's the only way to take the lead
This is reality homeboy, no make belief

[Hook]

[Verse 2: San Quinn]
Concrete, reinforced steel run against it
3 days, no sleep, hustle relentless
Drop benz, 2 seater on PCA
But my swisher is grape
You girl wanna date

One night stand but I refuse to lust her
Unless she pay me, I refuse to fuck her
Spending on money, I want hundreds of mills(I want hundreds of mills)
Being inda street, like automobiles

Le grande, compadre, my momma is real
I get chu outta yours boy, the choppa is real
My lugs a slugs, on fire from the jump off
On my way to KC, god peace the dump off

Never come soft, I dagger, viagra
Never fell off, nor ost my swagger
It's the mighty Quinn, take note of this
I knew it go hard, when I wrote this shit, yea

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr2theP]
I put that on my first born, second to third
Home run still second to third, whole shot, keep up if you can
This rap race,is fast pace, I lap cats doing their rain dance
Me, I just do what I can

With the gifts I was blessed with
With every verse dropped, that just thicken the plot
And I ain't nothing to mess with, ain't no second guessing
Down to the last cent, I'll die in the fucking bujes, to never be past tense

Like google, I add sense, not foogle with knowledge
Give a fuck about cash spent, I stay on my grind
I got the heart of a king
And they say to be a man, means provide for your seed and provide for your family

And that's by any means, by any means I go hard for the sake of my team
You call that struggle shit, I'm living the dream
And what's life without struggle?
Huh, that ain't living to me

[Hook][Hook]
Hustlin, thuggin, on one, nothin
Everywhere I move my gun is with me
Like what, you better move
Everywhere I move my gun is with me

[Hook]
I don't think you really wanna go there with me (go there with me)
I don't think you really wanna go there with me (go there with me)
I don't think you really wanna go there with me (go there with me)
I don't think you really wanna go there with me (go there with me)
[San Quinn]
You ain't seen a beast yet, now the monsters upset
Said you all know the cause, now you find out the effect
Of a reject with de-tect, I chose to tote
Eyes tight, weed and reek, shit I love to smoke
Fillmore Uptown, Downtown is the business
Round town lot of talk, couple clowns don't feel us
Bounce like ATLien, but the Californian
Me and Mess is VVS's, you Cubans are conian
Causin pandemonium, it's the Quinndomania
Sayin when I sayin, mister bomb bout to raise it up
Stage I'm bout to tear it up, bitches don't believe in us
Chasin dreams to me it seems, nigga get you scared of what

[Hook] + [Hook]

[Messy Marv]
I floss, I'm a boss
I put them yellow canaries in my cross
I got a gun, with a drum
I go Stewie nigga fuck goin dumb
Like what, nigga what
I'm retarded, I go the short bus
I'm a fool, a Tycoon
I snorted hop nigga out of a balloon
Shit I'm sick, you a bitch
I pull up and give you clowns a whole clip
You a ho, nigga you a punk
Say somethin watch yo ass get stomped, we can go there

[Hook] + [Hook]

[San Quinn] + (Messy Marv)
Everytime I move my gun is on me
I don't think ya'll really want it with me
Like blaow (like blaow), what now (what now)
You could move or get that ass bucked down (bucked down)

[Repeat - 2x]
Wanna talk that shit, you can be in the ditch
If you like that ho, you can leave with the bitch

(*Talking*)
Huh, what, what it do, what
What it do, what, what it do
What, what it do, what, what it do

(?) girls, I'm up on them girls
Tryin to put thangs in, take thong off girls
I can get a show with Louis in Idaho
Puff some real dro' before I go back to Spokane
And catch my plane to Chicago
They searchin, dogs sniffin through my cargo
Never move illegally, from there to Tennessee
Rollin up a Titan, sippin on some hennessey
It goes down, mo' brown in Cleveland
Ass round titties big gimme head this evenin

(Equipto)
From Yamagata to Yokohama
Suckas sound like Mary sayin no more drama
Indoja aroma its California
With females frontin off in Arizona
Its me and Quincy, off in Cincy
On a red eye flight and we high and tipsy
Mississippi and Carolina
From New Zealand all up through China
We land in London, its all on a fluke for real
And we chill in Brazil like Snoop
Proceed with caution, back to back shows in Austin
A wild response in Wisconsin
In Colorado where the groupies sweat us
Or the land down under with Gucci sweaters
In Delaware, I couldn't really care
I'ma set up my shop, from here to there

(San Quinn)
Like yeah, yeah, yeah
From here to there like yeah, yeah, yeah
We might go there yeah, yeah, yeah
From here to there like yeah, yeah, yeah
We might go there
Its Mr. Brook the menace crook

From the golden gate to the frozen state
Like my pops say, we get money
We might touch down,  out there in Australia
In the land down under
Get a little paper, from a young bitch
From out there in Australia ya dig
Or Philly, I meet ya in the Philippines
We in the Philippines wit guillotines
Bitch ya understand, yeah
Cuttin up the mothafucken razorblade
You know how we do
Wit the Nick Peace track, we stay slappin
And if we in your city right now
Put your hands in the air say yeah, say yeah, say yeah
Put your hands in the air and say yeah, say yeah, say yeah
And we outYah, yah it's northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look

Too short 85, girl that's your life smoking on that glass pipe
Had me paying attention my cousin loosing weight fast
Like apartments crooked in Lakeview, Grandma stayed across the street
Playing hoop in the gym when I heard the Cougar speak
Voice deep spitting rap said he was rolling dip and sick
Snake skin on top of the vill and that was eighty six
I was nine, then came eighty nine
Then came Richey Rich and d-loc
Oakland's 415
Groupie ass bitch tried to get a baller from the sideshow
And tried to be apart of MC Hammer's stage show
Hammer had MTV locked before Nelly and Will
I'm telling you this is real
He sold seventeen mil
Digital Underground Money B, Fuse, and Shock
Refuel the rap world by introducing Pac
From the same spot slang rocks wrote raps on the same soil
Check the next verse I'll spit more game for you

It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks and rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to every one that's not here

Richey Rich got cracked early nineties with a half a thing
Heavy in that rap game still getting that dough
MC Hammer bought helicopters from the cops from the O
Probably pushing that shit (shhhh), probably keeping it low
Mac Dre put Vallejo on the map first in the bay
You can tell me something good, if you know what to say
A Richmond cat named Filthy Phil made player hating a statement
Then he got even more famous
When he gave it to a cop trying to stop him
On some true bay thug shit, pulled his shit quick and popped him
I watch him on America's Most
I watch him put out a tape called the Manhunt and the nigga got ghost
Mac Dre still doing his thang, instead his Romper Room gang
Was robbing banks, media tried to ruin his name
Got convicted seven year in the feds
And about this time started writing them rhymes
And about this time the year was ninety one
I'm in the studio laying raps only for fun
Selling crack doing strong armed robberies at ATM's
Ninth grade high school always in the gym
My verses getting props in the bleachers
Spitting verbal heaters finna be on the shelf next season
Check the next verse I got more to say
About the real element going down in the bay

Northern California where the rappers crooks
Rappers locked down for years got they fame took
We made game made niggas put the world in fear
You better know that it's real out here

Spice One ninety one ninety two had the east bay shining
Spitting about that killing that jacking and that grinding
Then came 40 I'm tired of being stepped on
Mr. Flamboyant, here our respect come
2Pac dropped Tupacalypse now nine one
Brenda got a baby girl my age had a son
Real shit from a real nigga who ya'll mocked
Real game from a real place it's about to be hot
Since Too Short we sold tapes out of the trunk
And we never gave parties without having funk
It was 40 and the click, Dru Down and the Luniz
Too Short and the Dangerous Crew, here come the City
JT and the GLP, RBL Posse, Cougnut, Cellski, and IMP
X-raided out in Sac, Brother Lynch, and C-Bo
Totally Insane, Shawn from Palo Alto
Murder capitol nineteen ninety two
You niggas perpetrate the rhymes I rap are true
One cat on Rap-A-Lot named C from the East-O
The bay was on fire recognize it my people
Had deals on the table another verse to write
Let the world know the bay is worthy of the hype
From the bay to Sac, I testify on this track
So we can get back on track as I spit these raps

It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks, rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to every one that's not here

X-Raided went to jail, for killing somebody's momma
Up in Sac, with that blood and crip drama
Forty selling thousands of records got a deal with Jive
Worth about three point five
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC
See bone and AWOL playing with change ya'll
Trips to Atlanta, twenty deep on the plane dog
JT hooked four up with EMI
We sat back for a year and we seen him fly
2Pac sentenced for rape in ninety four
After being shot in skantless ass New York
Master P emerging hard up out of Richmond
Playing real tuff but he's only a sixth man
Luniz really put your eyes on him
When they dissed him on the flip side of five on it
GLP signed in ninety five along with Master P
Things about to change fast as can be
Short gave a picnic in Fairfield
Niggas busting a thousand people trying to find a shield
Death Row and Southern Cal running the rap game
Niggas got big deals (while) we fucking off big change
C-Bo in and out of jail parole violating and such
The whole nation is biting our stuff
Farrakhan million man march
Half a million guns spark
2Pac released on bail Shug Knight bought him
He told us the east would hate instead of jocking our style
On radio shows, commercials knocking us down
In the City RBL signed a deal at the end of the nine fifth
Then Mister C from RBL was shot dead
January first nineteen ninety six
And they say the bay isn't sick

Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks, rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to the ones that's not here

Coming strait from Northern California where the rappers crooks
Rappers locked down for years got they fame took
We made dank, made millions put the world in fear
You got to know that it's real out here
In Northern California???Yo JT tell her to give me a 7 UP man
Hey, hey that bitch tripping man, hey bring us some drinks ho
Man that show was liver than a motherfucker they was loving us
Man it was large as shit

Verse 1 (JT the Bigga Figga)

Check the sickness, forget this game that you missing
So I understand you had a plan to rip up potential
Players in the game without no shame to fault me
Realize that they surprised that you tried to salt me
I backed up off ya, I seen ya coming
Doing a 100 or more running, so now I'm gunning
If you try to play them players nigga than you getting played
Keeping my game tight so short like a razor blade
Afraid of who is what you ask me
Just because you got your mac10 ready to blast me
And pass me up as if you didn't know
Representing getting low, P nigga hit the floor

Verse 2 (Master P)

Sideways through the cut with the gold one's spinning
Suckers jealous cause they know the P is deep up in it
On my way to Filmore to see JT
We ain't set tripping its all about some dope beats
But you got to watch your back for them perpetrators
Imitators man I mean player haters
You know the type, that's quick to fucking give you dap
And all the while, they ready to fucking peel your cap
And if ya don't understand don't test me
Cause the P ain't living fucking nappy
I'll leave some motherfucking flowers at your gravesite
And make love to your bitch almost every night
Caught you slipping and you died like a perpetrator
On your tombstone should read player hater

(Chorus)

I ain't saying no names
Its alot of player haters ain't true to the game

Verse 3 (Master P)

Player haters in ya face wanna talk and laugh
Same fool in the hood with a ski mask
Don't move don't budge don't even flinch
Caught you slipping so they going for your dividends
I should put you on your back once they get your scraps
Cause they know a nigga like you is living fat
And as you stroll in the 4, cause life is cold
But don't trip cause that's just a bad episode
That life in the ghetto ain't no joke
At sometime you die in this game for selling dope
But if you don't sell dope, than you gotta kick it
And them same hoes, they wanna fucking kick it

Verse 4 (San Quinn)

Do you wanna ride to this or do you wanna side to this
Just a young baby boy coming with the flyest shit
Get you higher than that chronic can bring ya
Lets hit that niggas field
Coming from your shoulders, now you reaching for your steel
My ?? of real is a step away from nothing happened
Pick up the mic and get to rapping
Stepping like the?? making all these hoes something vicious
Not even these playa haters can identify my sickness
You taking winners to ?? while I caught myself
Hit the cuts and came up with legitimate wealth
From the ?? hardest city by the Bay
Busting rhymes, dropping nines dropping simply for a payday
Had his rest to make way
Before I break him down with the og russian cickle
When the shit don't tickle
My show won't pickle and I ain't no buster
You player hating niggas better stay away from a real hustler

And its like that for the 94 nigga

(Repeat 3x)

And its like that and its like that
And you player hating niggas don't like that[Hook:]

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]

Big titties
Big booty
Betsy
She was only 17 but she was sexy

And then there's Becky
18 and a half-er
She run like donner, rudolph, and prancer
No, I didn't have to romance her
But once I caught her
I couldn't shake her like cancer

And oh yeah nigga'
What about Ilene
She a fiend but she only nineteen

20 year old Claire and her best friend Blair
They square but they came as a pair

Show me the way to the next little girl
No 89 earthquake bitches for Furl

A Tina Turner bitch can't do nothing for me
Punk rock?

Little old Triscuit

I was just having some fun in the telly
No bandaid like Nelly but bang like R kelly
Really, you heard what I said
Now you punk ass wishin' I wouldn't of done what I did

Lacy, Stacy and the little ol' Haitian
'Smoov-E a sex offender and he on probation'

Don't run your mouth dog
Keep it cool
Got to drop this girl off
In front of the high school

These hot ass bitches
Is barely legal
I'll be serving life sentences
For three damn people

Perky ass titties
Thick old thighs
I slipped a girl a Mickey
Your hand full of black flies

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Oh don't ask why

[Verse 3: San Quinn]

Young bitches at the high school
Flossing my riches
I'm so cool

12th graders at least
18 years of age
20 minutes or less
In the Escalade

Looking at the tv
Porno flickin' it
She grabbin' it
Telling me to stick it in

10 inching it
Infinite hitting it
She want to fuck another girl
Ask could I fix it up

Away away
To the junior college
All the bitches love the Escalade
To my knowledge

Sure enough, pulling up
Bumping a little beat
Pull a clydesdale slut from the middle east

She's looking too worthy (too worthy)
Off two ecstasy pills and it's daytime
Only 2:30

Hop in, hop in
She's singing 'ayo for yayo'
But she's saying I'm not quinn (what!)

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way to the next little girl

Show me the way to the next little girl[Intro: Too Short]
Send a shout out to the homie Pac
Know you out there somewhere right now writing rhymes man, laying tracks
Straight love, you know what I'm saying always man
We had never forgot about 2Pac, you know, that's our boy till the end

From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac
From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh, pimp game impecable
Work game incredible (how many songs did he do)
Nine songs a day, no less than four
A rap legend, an icon, a reptible
Last time I seen him was at my Rapper's Ball video
Pac you'll be proud of me pimpin', I'm doing my best
Not only the Bay, but I'm holding down the West
And I just wanna thank Afeni (why)
For birthing 2Pac Shakur, the greatest rapper in history

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]
I'm glad we had a chance, to say goodbye
I shed so many tears and you changed my life
California Love baby ride or die
I can hear you, right now, Pac yelling West Side
And West it is, we got the world going dumb
We gone make 'em understand Pac where we coming from
Don't you worry homie, rest in peace
We appreciate your love, let your soul run free

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Look into the hearts of men, every pumping valve
Man I wish we had 2Pacalypse now
Like you, I wanna make the whole world love me
You let me know, only God can judge me
I got tears in my eyes as I write this verse
The whole Bay know you were hyphy first
You've been gone, we gon stand strong
Immortalized, the legend lives on

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes

[Verse 4: Mistah Fab]
This is for the great Amaru
God knew, that you, would ride through the ghettos of the world and provide food
For hopeless youth, dope feinds with dope to use
The way that you spoke your views gave hope to dudes
2Pac, the legendary Shakur
Makaveli the Don, a prophet I'm sure
And '96 man it dont seem like it's been
I can picture you rolling up in your 500 Benz

[Verse 5: Mac Mall]
You gave me love on the ghetto scene
Put me on a million TV screens, with you
I remember drinking liqour at century clubs
Watching superstars sworn over Thug Life
You took a youngin from the Crest Side world wide
Real thizzness, I was family when you died
I'm a real outlaw and I'mma ride til the end of time
And when I see you on the other side
I crack the cap on the Henny
And Big Back, would I lie?

[Verse 6: Band-Aide of Dem Hoodstarz]
All eyes on me, dear mama, its me against the world
You know I get around like your brendas little girl
Blast me, no im not telling you the blasphemy
Pac was a [?], his death was a tragedy

[Verse 7: Scoot of Dem Hoodstarz]
Come with me, hail mary to the soldiers
Spit at the cameras, flipping off the rollers
I swear you made a nation full of thugs, put your W's up
And make the West Coast feel like one, rest in peace Pac

[Chorus: Jimmie Reign, Meilani]

[Verse 8: Turf Talk]
(Aye Pac wassup mayne)
Man I've been missing Makaveli since '96
Pac the games change, there are hella wimps
Picrture Me Rolling, one of my favorite songs
Satrin At The World Through My Rearview, Life Goes On
Had dreams of working with you, but it never happened
But I ain't trippin, we'll collaborate some day in heaven
All your albums classics, all of them slapping
Is there a heaven for a G, I know you got it cracking

[Verse 9: Lil Uno of The Pack]
Makaveli, 2Pac, he was a legend
But he in a better place, on earth we call it heaven
'96 is the year that we lost a gift
You gone, but not forgotten, and you always will be missed

[Verse 10: Lil B of The Pack]
Man, Pac, we love you, ain't nobody above you
You music touched us, and the people we buzzing
It's all about Pac, yeah the angel with the broken wings
Rose from concrete, he's still here is what it seems

[Verse 11: Young L of The Pack]
Stand troops, recognize the truth
Here lies the dude who lived rough and died for you
Took slugs and spilt his blood to lace the youth
And told young niggas to get up and face the blues
Cause it's a thugs life, everyday is what we do
Love life, believe and you'll see it through
So to my brother Pac make a place for me with you
I'mma represent you, till I reach the tool

[Chorus: Ray Luv, James "D-Train" Williams, Martha Wash]

[Verse 12: Baby Bash]
He used to clown around, when he came around with the underground
Hit the V-Town with Kyrie on some thunder pounds
Even directed the video (Mac Mall)
He was on some major shit way back then but we didn't know
How a genius get to work, on the herb and the purp
Probably looking down, smiling now on some purp
He had love for us Mexicans
Loves to see young playas stacking Benjamins

[Verse 13: Nump Trump]
I wake up and blaze one for Pac every morning
It's Mr. I Got Grapes, picture me rolling
Everybody knows this, or knew what it was
When we found out Pac passed, it was so messed up
We was crushed, couldn't beleive it, Gorilla-Pinos and all
But we still slap your album so the music lives on
When tomorrow comes, we still ride for Makaveli
From the low-lows to scrapers, you smell me

[Verse 14: Shock G]
Pac, he didn't mean to die, he got in over his head
Died for you but wasn't trying to be dead
He went round and round, cause there wasn't nothing better to do
What could be better than dying for you
Split the blunt, put the Hennessey in the cup
Let me see ya, let me see ya toss it up
We all feel 2Pac, now that he's gone
But recognize those alive who sing the same song, c'mon

[Chorus: Kimberlee Payton, Isa S. Chu, Laura Lane, Nancy Zumwalt][Messy Marv]
Awww yeah, yeah, yo
Young Mess struck the Mac and his lights went out
Then I knocked all the ice out his mouth
Check it out, one to the face, two to the neck
Hit the liquor sto', then went back to the 'jects
The fiends get credit, them hoes post up
The police patrol, feds take close ups
The block stay hot, it's work outside
Don't ride through stuntin, cause you niggas might die
When the sun go down, them wolves come out
Say the wrong shit I put the heater in yo' mouth
Them boys sit on Tuesday, the money come fast
I'm on the block with like, 50-11 rocks in my ass, be cool

[Hook]
When the sun goes down, the wolves come out
The guns been outside, and we don't have droughts
The fiends get credit, them hoes post up
The police patrol, feds take close ups
When the sun goes down, the wolves come out
The guns been outside, and we don't have droughts
The fiends get credit, the hoes post up
The police patrol, feds take close ups

[San Quinn]
Night time is the right time to use that K
Two-two-threes ain't cool they abuse yo' face
I'm a stand up guy, I don't sit down
Killers don't talk, they break up crowds
Eleven to six, have yo' pumpkin covered
Your family won't love it when you turn up smothered
I give day away, on lay away
My shit so pure they can't stay away
Plates with the groove it be tearin your nose up
Blades so sharp they be tearin they toes up
Put ten on yo' helmet, Niner or Raider
Bronco or Charger, we will deflate ya

[Hook]

[Messy Marv]
Yeah, man fuck that Remi, bitch I'm on Gin
The O.G.'s say I'm on my way to the pen'
I don't give a fuck, its rocks in my low
The stones in my mouth keep my Metro froze
Fillmoe nigga, the belly of the beast
They love me out in Oakland from the Bottoms to the East

[San Quinn]
Some claim they thuggin, but they stay out clubbin
We outside waitin, got security duckin
Bullets fly past ya, hittin bystanders
Bout that gossip, you can die over slander
Jumpin out the Phantom, doors suicide
Gangsta's inside, and we don't coincide

[Hook][Verse 1]
Sittin' fat on twenty inches, yeah and kickin' the flow
I used to be in the corner on my five point toes
Wrote raps with meaning, flashback to my younger days
In the summer, wanted her number but then she turned away
She turned the channel see my face on the screen
Now she havin' visions about replacin' my queen
Brought up the cream but she wouldn't see a nickel see a track
With comps on the big in the middle
Tryin' to fit em' now because of my fame
Y'all need support keep lovin' the name
Pushin' the Range with a dot in the six
I'm heavy in the mixed and you coughed on my tit

[Hook x4]
We balled out, we grind out, we shined out
And when you see me on the tv then you find out

[Verse 2]
What they know about court life, locked down on titaniums
Saved a pocket full of them yays because they payin' em'
That's nothin' balled out shined out we big timin' on some other shit
Collectin' them faces they fit us fine
It's no surprise we pullin' up in the best
All leather with the wood grain rest, nothin' less
Confess we used to solve it all but gangstas know who we are
Playstation it's connect in each and every car
Gold teeth and French braids or the full fades
Bring it all together and bibble cause we all paid
Over-nighters on airplanes get the red-eye
Face to face negotiations and we keep it better
Now dig this, you say you wanna get the cheddar
Face to face negotiations and we keep it better
And all money ain't good money
You can't tell on the streets we determined to make mail

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Shhh, I get with it no problem, hundred G's I got em'
Five hundred Benz on twenty lone pros and drop em'
Livin' life me and my wife sittin' on the hill and we plush
Hey never enough and enough ain't enough
I bubble up and flip my fetti and double up
Like automatics and gauges and tech nigga is what's up, ha
I bring nothin' but that Southern Cali, Northern Cali gangbang
Mentality, so when you try to come battle me
Hit the game up with diamonds, you love the way they be shinin'
And I keep on grindin' that's when the 4-5 blindin'
Worried and nervous and nervous as fuck
I ai't got no license I ain't givin' a fuck
If you ain't got no money stay the fuck away from us
You see me in my Caddy lookin' clean as fuck

[Hook x4][Deleted]

Verse 1 *(JT Tha Bigga Figga)*

I slap some twinkies on my two-door Camaro
Mucho dinero
Traded a fuel injected carborator for a hottie 4-barrel
Ship kits fo' Cam
Break down the grams on the dash
Put the 4, 15's wit the Floor Masters hangin out the ass
An we love to smash
Back to back in Vett's and Jags
From the west coast California where them ol skools act bad
Wit the rest of the fam strikin in hot Vogues an shit
Quick to scratch up a playas pocket an keep on poundin this shit

Verse 2 *(Mac Mall)*

Appear quiet, bust in my grill
Young titan wit the toys concealed
Big nuts an nerves of steel
Got money to make
I'm bout to serve Francis Drake
Pullin hundreds an toss the keys to LA
Boss ballin in Green Bay
As the hood take brothas
Under
We be countin crispy federal notes
Cuz I ain't tryin to sell dope
In 2-triple-0
White folks knock my hustle
Like I'm the mayor of the City Of Dope
Me an my thugs hit the lobbies
Looking like we'll smuther everybody
Kamakazi bout this money don't try me
My cuddie
My cromies
In this, we the titans to meet
Juss a day in the life of the elite
So don't hate me, hate the game
You hate it cuz you workin wit small change
Sucka who's to blame?
Matter fact don't answer that
You'll probably say some square shit an Mackin' Ass gon' have to put you on

You besta come wit mo than some choppas to try an rush me

Chorus *(JT Tha Bigga Figga)*

By know them niggas know
Don't lose focus tryin to scope us
Watch us like the rollas
Get in closer wanna blow us
I'm the playa that don't play no games

Feel the fire as I flame
Every verse aimed at yo brain
The pencils in yo house ain't
You need to watch yo spouse mayne

Juss thought I'd let you know
The falsified on dime
Real G's kill 'em all
If you Mac'in keep it crackin like my nigga Jamal
If I fall

On bastards
Through the "Total Recall"
On phony stars as we mash in
For hoes, it's hard to get at ya
We down cash advancements so fresh you'll figure fashion
Crashin the cars
An dismatling marks
Fake niggas wit no heart they get they ass ripped apart
We sharper than a needle, an I bust it wit my people
Get leathal if I hit ya wit this sleeper
Ain't too hard to reach ya
Like a teacher seat ya in a corner like a dunce
Cuz ya known as a clone and performer of them stunts
And I'm tired of givin warnings to punks
Thinkin cuz we rappin, we about to front
You be the first to see a hearst chump
I know you don't want no funk

All up, up in this game
But you suckas fakin

Whippin it
Puttin it down as usual
Campaingin an maintainin
Oh, it's goin down
Uh, it's goin down
Uh, an we out
An we out[20 second instrumental to open]

[San Quinn]
Drama is real, like not wakin up
I'm breakin up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
If you kill it no more standin on that corner like a stop sign
Everytime you spotted they call it shot time
Not at the gym but in the grim reaper's hands
You important if a bullet hits, injure your plans
This is not an adventure, but a full-time duty
If you seen how niggas hit the club, they pullin out uzis
Sometimes bruisin and grazin, mostly takin
No more sleep for the shooter, no more of that hangin
No mo' trustin hoes you ain't know fo' ten plus
No mo' smokin with the homies, no mo' late night clubs
Cause the victim, is ready to stick him like a mousetrap
I'm 'bout to rap, you better be 'bout peepin out cash

[Hook: The Game]
If there's blood on my Nikes I done murdered a nigga
If the stash spot smokin I done murdered a nigga
San Quinn got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggas
We take this beef shit further than niggas
Streets are shady, the Game got curtains for niggas
All-of-a-sudden-ass killers never heard of these niggas
Have your whole family cryin a river, we'll murder you niggas
We take this beef shit personal nigga

[The Game]
I ain't met a nigga yet could fuck with this rap vet
I'm the realest since I came in the game on Kam back
Rest in peace to Mausberg, gotta live with that
Keep the M2 on my hip, I live with that
Eat with that, sleep with that, come get me
Four-fifty put somethin through your son Easter basket
Six in your truck, get you each a casket
Put termites in your box let 'em eat your cabbage
A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic
Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active
If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes
But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic
Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail
Cops on the payroll so me and Quinn live well
And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well
Shotgun got mo' punks than shells

[Hook]

[The Game]
See the Escalade got 'em runnin downhill, snowball niggas
We throw vapors out of truck windows, blow our figures
Suede corners out the sunroof, the fifth or the Ruger
Broad daylight, blow the windows out of your Cougar
Move in the S5, plus my, leather dust fly
Spark up a dutch, Game put niggas in a coffin too much
Turn niggas kids into orphans too much, In God We Trust - nah
Keep the fifth close like Starsky & Hutch
Your daughter cryin it's just {?} tuck, but so what
Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts
Have you eatin soup for months, broken jaw, lick your shit out of straws
I guess I got that same ol' harm
I ain't for play, the Game is raw
Specialize in death jackets, here try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese cause if you owe me
Guns O-U-T, we all gon' squeeze

[Hook]Hell yeah

Daz Dillinger, San Quinn, what up check it oh boy

[Daz Dillinger]
Ya see I'm all about lavish shit, plushed out havin' it
Fifty g's a twenty gauge on my cabinet
Shit, can't be half steppin'
Niggas be lookin' around blastin' niggas with any reppin'
My profession I selected, directed
Shit, I'm a boss nigga and I'm highly respected (No doubt)
With the stacks cause I layed to the game no pressin' it
Niggas wanna get down but niggas freebasin'
Fuck it up from the Beach down to Filmoe
Give it up, niggas duckin' and it's real ghost
And a nigga hand in pain cause of the wrist
Countin' a million a stack matchin' it
Why try to fade me, the invincible
Principal comin' out as the invisible
I got it locked from every hood to every spot
To want a mack Glock, damn it stay hot
Every other sucker and buster beware
It's a Dogg Pound gangsta on the loose out there
And I'm comin' I'm comin' comin' and comin'
And I'm runnin' I'm runnin' and I'm gunnin' and I'm gunnin'

[San Quinn]
They can't stop my paper chasin'
Keep it crackin' on the back streets
Collectin' them chips and all stacks
Who be in tact, nobody really knows the hustle
Sportin' one day, bouncin' back with legs buckled, like that
Fortified, I know these niggas be hatin'
Watch they faces as they can't stand seein' me skatin' (Woo-woo)
Politicin' nah playa no polished tickets
Debt tapes, cash advances and meal tickets
Dogg Pound gangstas and the G-O-P
We from the 415 they from the 213
Beneath the layers like the window, ballin' me and my kin folk
Squattin' on these twenty inch dubs, tint on window

[Hook: San Quinn (E-40) x4]
We independent in the game that we bubble
Cause it's the life, the life, the life, the life (The life)

[JT the Bigga Figga]
We bring this shit like the Wild West, Filmoe to Foul-Set
We slang crack and run around with a tech
What did I mean, I'm tryin' to push something clean
Like a 500 CL, nigga please believe
With the stackin' c, puttin' g's on g's
For another hit they beg oh please, oh please
Try to freeze our accounts, I put the strap on ya tongue
I'm doin' this to eat bitch not rappin' for fun
I'm the first to speak and the first to leap
With two concrete feet, touchdown hurt the streets
Hold court in the streets, judgement to the winner of beef
No more clubbin' nigga, no more sleep, uh

[E-40]
Spend safari, ya better go cop a pack of smokes
40 why orwhere ya been
Oh you been givin' out prescriptions and antedotes
Takin' notes, shootin' dice, practicin' my literature
With my folks, Filmoe niggas, ask JT he the bigger figure
Nifty with my spitter, full off that alcohol off The Liks
Old school zig-zag nigga smokin' on some of that cat piss
Pokin' and strokin' the batches, patchin' up my dips
Seven-fifty a pop, nigga that's how I been doin' this
Sellin' tapes out the trunk of my car, independent shit
Fuckin' with these distributors, tryin' to get nickel rich
Tryin' to get nickel rich, fuckin' with these distributors
Moms and pops loyal fans, redeems and vans, ooh(Verse 1)
(Daz Dillinger)
I grab a bottle of gin and take a swig of my drank
I got a half ounce of bomb so I light up the dank
Smokin, chokin, hopin that the day goes smooth
Ain't no tellin, cuz a nigga right here might lose
I choose to do it G like it's supposed to see
Funky fresh in the flesh it's the D-A-Z
Call my nigga on the phone tell him it's poppin again
I got a fifth of Henn now the story begin
It's been a long time comin
Runnin, gunnin ya niggas back and forth
See I don't need no support
See I do it by my lonely, so fuck ya phonies
All you niggas and you bitches don't really know me
See I dump from the gate, huh, loaded with hate
Rob ya for ya cake, and be on my way
I'm so mafioso, out the fo' do', niggas 'round here don't know, so

(Sean T)
Heavy in the game, unpredictable
Inner thought, heated is heavy
You can tell motha fuckaz turn pale
Ain't no love for you other niggas up and pluggin niggas
You ain't shit without your homboys y'all ain't pullin triggaz
Rock mail is irrelevant
I rise up and cause shit since an adolescent
I've been breakin laws takin jaws everyday ghetto life
Got me kinda Alamo
But still I got pulled like a trigga nigga way sicka
You don't wanna see a whore anyway in fashion
I'm Sean T, and I stay lit off the gangsta passion
So picture me mobbin a SUV
When I'm duckin and dodgin steady robbin
Fuck the police I got you open like a split wound
Goin like you on shrooms
I'm shinin like a diamond, brighter than a full moon
Make room, hungry niggas ride fa sho'
Avoidin detours, haters, and the sheisty 5-0

(Chorus X2-San Quinn)
I see a pile of gold I got my hands in it
Gotta eat so we think 'till we stand in it
Niggas move smokin fast when they land in it
Cuz they runnin up them bitches and the lavish shit
Sounds of us can never have enough
If you comin with the bullshit then back it up
Sounds of us can never have enough
If you comin with the bullshit then back it up

(Verse 2)
(San Quinn)
We get it at a low price shit hit the streets
Now we all in the lime light shinin
Rhyme right, for my wrong niggas after long figgaz
Gettin fake ballers never payin gold diggers
Roll wit us, we sucka free
Make ten mil at least
Where young niggas gotta keep a heat
JT makin moves with San Quinn at his side
Ready to ride, from East to Westside
Fillmoe to Long Beach out the crest side
KC to Detroit we got ties
Make the crowd rise when we drop a rhyme
We got to shine, makin moves after mine

(JT The Bigga Figga)
Circulate, rotate we keep it crackin
Boss game, DPG, Get Low factors
You want action, hotel to motel where we all make mil
Bust sales it's so real
Live shit, work now and floss later
Countin the cakes you knucklin up with the haters
And the playaz, stuck in the lab it's been official
Ridin the tracks and we act to get a issue
It's official, comin to get you we makin moves we the dudes
Holdin them tools we got news for the crews
On the underground pushin them tapes
Keep the business over West you talkin shit in my face, bitch

(Millo)
The streets is watchin, like I'm watchin the streets
24 around the clock, I'm gettin my grease
My young souls, keepin it crackin
From the Bay to LA, tryin to stay lavish
Orientated, keep it in the family
Niggas can't handle me, cuz I'm so savly
Marinated, and leadin the team
Hooked up and got tucked with the GLP
Recognize game, when it's in your face
Hard hittaz, hustlaz, on a paper chase
We gettin laced, by the finest in the West
When we hit the front do' we demandin our respect

(Chorus X2-San Quinn)
I see a pile of gold I got my hands in it
Gotta eat so we think 'till we stand in it
Niggas move smokin fast when they land in it
Cuz they runnin up them bitches and the lavish shit
Sounds of us can never have enough
If you comin with the bullshit then back it up
Sounds of us can never have enough
If you comin with the bullshit then back it up
