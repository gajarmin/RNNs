[Intro: DeJ Loaf]
You ain't got no whip, you ain't got no bottle
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
You ain't got no cash, you ain't got no dollas
You stay with that drama, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, just keep it real with ya
You the only nigga here feeling yourself
Walk in, them bitches start filming
They sittin' with a man, thotty ass still grinning, it's on
Honest, so hot, mind on a comet
Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic
I don't give a fuck, bitch with or without a condom
Fat Joe, pockets lean back like a recliner
I'm in this, representing West Side
Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Batgang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin'
Sippin' P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants
On the real

[Pre-Hook: Kid Ink]
You could call anyone you want
I'ma kill 'em all, bet on it
Said we the only ones that stuntin' now
Let's just be real

[Hook: DeJ Loaf & Kid Ink]
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Yeah let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, we all know the deal
So let's just be honest, let's just be real

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Uh, slow down babe
It's enough, to go round back
Been drinkin' like you thirsty
How you make it to my section in the first place
Nah, I ain't trippin', shit is nada
They say it ain't trickin' if you got it
Bitch I'm a boss like Gotti
Rock Tom Ford and I still pop Molly
Roll up good Cali, la di da di
It's just me and all my hommies
At your door like the shining, egh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga
And the bitch that I'm with know she hot stuff
Pull up in the hot wheels, ballin' get yo hops up
If you got a problem get a hotline
9-1-1 but we don't ever call the cops, for real

[Pre-Hook & Hook][Intro: Rich Homie Quan].......
Came in at first, had bad luck
Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had nothin'
We done sold out, now everybody mad at me
Tell 'em roll out, now everybody smashin'
Get ready cause you know we 'bout to be a problem
Hope you ready cause you know it 'bout to be a problem

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes
Paper chase, vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, boy, better check your tone
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me
Preferably one of the best
She ridin' cause we next now and forever to death
Be loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest
We just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Got no time to waste
And no way these niggas stoppin' me, oh no
Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
And I can do this with my eyes closed
Blindfold two times over
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over
Talkin' on Melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's defeat to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
That's cold cutting
And I've been this dope for like four summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake
I know this shit that bone you pick
Might leave you niggas fillets

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YG]
It's YG 4hunnid!
Is you ridin'?
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence
If Jimmy got caught up, but you was right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet??
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake-friend syndrome
There's no cure so them symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be something
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this, this, and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker
For me and my day one hittas

[Outro: Kid Ink]
Ride out![Produced by StarGate and Ori Kaplan]

Just give me you, just give me you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Camila]
It's all on you, it's all on you
It's all on you, so what you wanna do?
And if you don't have a clue, not a clue
I'll tell you what to do
Come harder just because
I don't like it, like it too soft
I like it a little rough, not too much
But maybe just enough

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It's no pretending, that we've be getting to it all night
I'm off so much liquor
Probably did a couple things that my girl won't like
Red light, gotta slow it down, get my head right
Try and take it to the hotel, yeah right
Talking 'bout she won't tell, yeah right
I don't really know the finessing
I don't answer like it's bill collectors
Shawty try'na act so wreckless, I don't even stress it
See we got her going up 'til breakfast

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shawty saw the wings on the car
She forgot about her plans for tomorrow
Best friend next room, ear to the wall

She gon' throw it up, she gon' break it down
Shawty got her own but she can't find a nigga like me

Baby let me put your panties to the side

‘Cause I'mma give you what you need, yeah

But I don’t know what it is
Cause you remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me
You remind me of something
But I don’t know what it is right now
You remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, on the real no lie
I don’t know what it is but you just my type
Everything just right, B said put it to the left
Don’t listen to the hype though
Got a cup in your hand
Baby sitting but you ain’t got no kids
We ain’t leaving ’til there ain’t no more left
Can’t see no time on the Rolex
I could tell you a freak, go show it
Looking for the after party, where the door at?
Go on the floor like a doormat
Baby you know where to throw that
I said...

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Mami you remind me of something
But I don’t know what it is
Cause you remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me, yeah
You remind me of something
But I don't know what it is right now
Cause you remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me

[Bridge 2: Chris Brown & Kid Ink]
Baby if you know what it is
On a real, can’t lie, man you just my type
Hands in the air looking for a bitch right now
On a real, can’t lie, man you just my type

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don’t really care who you came with (no)
Unless you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex try to fight you
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand
So high, ain’t nowhere to land
You remind me of something missing
Missus, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the tension
If I get a minute, I’ll put your bad ass in detention

[Bridge 1]

[Bridge 2]

[Break: Chris Brown]
Oh baby show me, show me something
Tomorrow I might be hungover, but that don't mean nothing
You see all night long, I've been wrong
Baby show me something
She gon' let me do it

[Bridge 1][Partial Hook: Kid Ink & Chris Brown]
I said why you over there lookin' at me?
While I'm with my girlfriend
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, let's take it to the hotel

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I said why you over there lookin'?
Got a starin' problem and you fuckin'
I know you see my girl, stop frontin'
I could tell you up to a lil' somethin', hol' up
I'ma play it cool, baby roll one
While you make your way and get over here
My girl ain't down then it's over
Just tell her that she look good when I'm over there
In the first place, pour one up
Baby don't be too thirsty
Groupie love ain't ever gon' work see
Hoes ain't loyal and never keep it lowkey
That ain't alright
I'ma take a shot, couple shots thru the night
Tell a joke, keep it fun, make her feel it's alright
Give you the game wholesale
And bet a hundred that I take 'em to the hotel

[Hook: Kid Ink & Chris Brown]
I said why you over there lookin' at me?
While I'm with my girlfriend
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, we could take it there
Let's take it to the hotel, baby we could take it there
Take it to the hotel, baby leave with me
Know I got a penthouse suite
I said why you over there lookin' at me?
While I'm with my girlfriend

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's kinda hard when I see you lookin' over here
With them eyes
I got a girl but I'm feelin' your body
So I'ma have to just play both sides
I hope she don't come over here
Cause I'm with my girl, you know I love her
I got two of my bitches in the club
And they know about each other, oh no

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
But a nigga never Paranoid
You fuckin' with a man not a little boy
What? I could barely hear your lil voice
In the club but your body makin' all the noise
Clap it up, stack it up
Where your purse? Just pack it up
Grab her hand, tell her we should go now
If you really wanna take this party to the hotel
.

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
Over there lookin' all suspicious
Get a clue girl, don't be a mystery
I see you likin' on all my pictures
Of me and my bitch up in all of our business
So, you gotta know it ain't a limit to
What a pill and the liquor do
Make a straight girl go down, just spit down
I might fuck around and lick her too
It ain't a problem, my metabolism high
Eat you both up for dinner
Just keep it real with a real mothafucka
Ain't got time for no pretenders
Now just bring it to me
That fleek, that freak, no classy stuff
Been pushin' up, don't pussy now
Bitch, what you really on?

[Hook][Intro: Kid Ink]
Money and the power
Once you get a 'lil they just want to take you down (cause)
I got the money and the power
Once you get a 'lil they just want to take you down (cause)
We’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on?
Really ain’t nothing, I could drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
It’s nothing, nothing to get it poppin’
Wanna roll. Roll up, up, and away
Here we go now
Now Martin had a dream, I’ve been dreamin’ ’bout gold
Tell ‘em I just wanna shine, and I gotta let it show
Show up on the scene, walk right through the door
Got a nigga on repeat, it’s my double up flow
Vibrate the whole building, I ain’t ringing through your phone
Waiting ’til the smoke clear, can you see me through the fog?
Fall back, it could go all bad
We be goin’ hard with your ex, oh Tic-tac
Tacky motherfuckers must not be hip yet
Life is a bitch, but I bet I get that bitch wet

[Hook: Kid Ink]
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on? (Yeah)
Really ain’t nothing, I can drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Ma-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down (cause)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
But I’m ready, ready, so you can tell ‘em to bring it on
On a whole other level of high, no phone
Foes all mad ’cause the dough don’t fold
Forget about your plans, we ain’t leavin’ ’til it close
Close to the top, I can barely see the ground
With the whole team here, everybody get around
Look like a parade when we’re coming through your town
One hand to the sky, two feet to the ground
Wait, can’t stop ’til the sun’s up
Party everywhere ever since I got my funds up
Yup, pray to God it never run out
Off that loud, burnin’ rubber, need to slow it down

[Hook: Kid Ink]

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Mon-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down, (cause(x2))
That, that’s how it is
When you fuckin’ with me, you should know how it goes
That, that’s how it is
I’ve got a bottle in my hand and a pocket full of dough

[Outro: Kid Ink][Verse 1: Sterling Simms]
Stop, wait, hold up, a nigga tryna roll up
But only if I could roll with you
So baby what’s up, now what you tryna say cause
I’m really feelin' like I’m feelin' you
Oh baby girl I think you’re cool
A couple of swisher sweets for two
So if you wanna burn it down I’ll let you lick it
Baby you ain’t got nothin' else to lose

[Hook: Sterling Simms]
We about to roll it, roll it
We, about to roll it, roll it
We about to roll it, roll it
Yeah, yeah, so roll it, roll it

Come on, come on

[Verse 2: Sterling Simms]
Diesel, O Kush, now baby what do you prefer?
I think I prefer you

And everything about this motherfucka’s cool

No Reggie always smokin' that loud
In case you thinkin' why they over there hating

[Hook: Sterling Simms]
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Just wanna smoke with you tonight, tonight
Smoke with you ... Oh you don't smoke?

Ah shit, hold up, I got you, I got you and shit

Oooh and I’m wanting your body, oooh you look like a 'Hot Tottie'
You prolly would make me feel so damn better, so better, so badder
You wetter than any other body I ever had and
I want you so fuckin' bad and
Somethin' about all your tats is so ratchet I want it don't make me imagine
I’ll be your pussy assassin, let’s make this a fuckin' classic
Only fuck bitches with accents so let’s make it happen

Baby girl you could lean on me, sippin' on this dirty Sprite that
Pussy clean, in 'the words I heard you like to dirty talk
In a minute I’ma make you scream! Scream like you afraid of the dark now
Boo, never had a nigga come through, used to bein' with fools
I ain’t tryna accuse, girl, gon' plead the fifth
You don’t wanna take shots, we don’t need no fifth
Got this 'Drank In My Cup', let me pour you up
Shorty, talking 'bout she wanna meet Molly, girl you
Wildin', I said crazy, after this Dick like Tracy
I don’t know who you tryna impress, don‘t give in to the peer pressure

Watch the money fall down, 360, 360, 360
Baby turn that ass around, 360, 360, 360

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I know you see it go around, money full circle
Blunt in full circle, smoking on that colour purple
On the beat I go silly, real ugly motherfucker
Bitches love that I'm a rapper but she know I ain't a sucker
360, look might break your neck
Everybody double take now I'm late on set
Got a pocket full of green, faces like Gumbee
'Bout to take another round call it 720
Headed to the club going close in an hour
One on one on, East bound and down Kenny Powers
I just took off face look sour, I can here 'em screaming my name like Alvin
I'm just sitting back recline like Calvin
High you can see it in my eyes like Simon
Going way past 60
Girl I think you just missed me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yo I say what goes around comes around, 360
When it comes to bad bitches I keep three with me
One to fuck me good, one to suck me good
One to ride hard, hold the work tuck it good
Only thing I wish, I wish a motherfucker would
I'm living life and getting money like I fucking should
I'm on another level, that make you understood
Oh you ain't understanding, nigga I am making good
360, we make 'em 360
Popcorn looking like a box of rice crispy
If I don't make the record shit the feds gonna get me
Cause I'm gonna keep shining on these haters 'til they hit me
100 thousand dollars cash, $20 bills bitch, I be on that real shit
Tryna chase a mill shit
Just came back from Hollywood and Ill Will, the Will Smith
Right back to the hood with my goons tryna kill shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I said bitch I'm the bomb, everything hunneds
'Bout to take another round call it 9-hunned
Call me when you sitting home alone like Mc Culkin
'Bout to leave the club but I don't know where the fuck the sun is
See me speeding through the city like we racing in a summit
I ball, might crossover, hop step, dunk it
360, leave the hole open in a fast break
Why you think yo girl ain't call since the last date?
Huh, I'm gone, backspace
I've been rozay red, cafe
Bunch of bitches on they tippi toes like ballet
Smoking all day, have an eight in the ashtray
Get it good, hit it's feeling like a facelift
I don't recycle motherfucker I'm wasted
I got a head like Gena
And my bitch got an ass like Trina

[Hook][Intro: Trey Songz & Kid Ink]
She doin' it wrong
Egh!
Trigga, Trigga

(Mustard on the beat ho!)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
In the club and this nigga looking at me kinda strange
I got the woman he love sippin' my champagne
But she ain't doin' nothin' wrong
She just fuckin' with a young, rich nigga
Tell that boy stop acting like a bitch nigga

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You should get some money, why you bullshittin'?
You should get some money, why you bullshittin'?
My nigga you should get some money, why you bullshittin'?
I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
Girl I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
You could bet that, check my stats
From way way back nigga we've been doing this
Same old clubs and the same bitches you just met
Nigga I ain't got time
If the bezel ain't diamonds, presi Obama
Pool in the Bahamas, black ferragamo
Need me some condoms, we fuckin' up commas, honest
Right now this rap shit is crackin' for me
If it didn't work out we'd be back to the streets
See life is a bitch crazier than Kelis
But I'm picturing money, my nigga say cheese
Feel fresh like Axe on me
Nah y'ain't gotta put up no act for me
Your girlfriend already said you act so cheap

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I'm about mine, tell me is you 'bout yours?
Yeah she say I'm a dog but she down on all fours
Yeah she down on the floor cause there's money all over
Then back on the pole with it
Now I got time, cause now I got change
Shit the cup got drank and we 'bout to get high girl
What did you think?
I say God to your dress but no you ain't no saint
Shit

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
You know you coming to the crib girl ain't cha
You drinking all this liquor girl ain't cha
I'm feeling on your booty girl ain't I
Show you how to have a real good time
So bust it for me, elbows on your knees
We don't care who's lookin', Mustard on the beat

[Verse 5: Kid Ink]
Ball hard and yo' bitch tryna reach
No it ain't my fault that she's running through the streets
Dumb blonde, got you looking like a fool nigga
Said

[Hook]

[Outro: Trey Songz & Kid Ink]
I got all bad bitches at my table
What I'm gon' do with 'em
All this money that I can't hold
Throw some, taunt it
Only bad bitches at my table
That's all I got
Which one of y'all I'ma take home
I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
Girl I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
You should get some money, why you bullshittin'?[Hook:]
I said don't you act like that
Just let your freak out
I think we should leave now
Don't you act like that
Tried something new
The things I'm a do to you
You too
Things I'm a do to you
You too
Things I'm a do to you, you
Had you running to your friends
Like, damn he the man
Might just let you get a chance girl

[Verse 1:]
Uh, I see you looking at your girlfriend
Yeah, I'm sayin' like she your girlfriend
Damn, you probably think I don't know
Keep it real, my mind is on the same thang
See you ain't gotta change the way you feel
Girl you still shine like stainless steel
In my eyes but tonight let's make a deal
Gon' tell the waiter to get the bill now
Some say, 3's a crowd but
I say, it's looking like a party now
Some say 2 heads are better than one
Sounds good to me, would you agree
I ain't tryin' to pressure you at all
But remember the night
When we first had to talk and
You said if you was drunk and
She was bad as fuck then
We could probably try something
'Till you had enough now

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Some say what they wanna say
Just let me know if you want to wait
But I can tell, it's written all on your face
And it's no better to time or place
Than now, tell me how does that sound
California king lay you both down
Huh, It's getting hot in here
Think I might just sit back and watch in here
Now don't you act like that
You know you the one girl
And it's only fun
You can't make it a personal vendetta
At the end of the day
You know you gonna get it better
So why sit and worry about tomorrow
After tonight steady lookin' at my phone
Seein' if she called girl
That ain't what I'm on
And you should already know

[Hook – Kid Ink]
You can tell em Imma do, what I want
I don’t care about your rules, just can’t lose
I said we ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it, no
We ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it
All I need

[Verse 1 – Lil Bibby]
Said I ain’t worried bout a damn thing
Spent 20 grand on this damn chain
And if niggas thinking I’m a damn stain
Put a couple slugs in his damn brain
Cause we always strapped up
We ain’t got to call for back up
Don’t be fooled by this rap stuff
You can get your ass clapped up
Got two 30 clips, and a 50 in the trunk, we ain’t worried bout it
They said it’s in my car, on the scene last week
Three niggas got shot and I ain’t heard about it
Riding round with the pump, niggas still try to front
I done told niggas once, I ain’t taking no lose
Be smooth when you fucking with the bosses
Step up, it’s gon be a lot of coffins, baow baow

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Lil Bibby]
All I know is get money, nothing else
Niggas better keep their hands to they self
On my mama, if a nigga touch me
Then I promise he won’t touch nobody else
All I need is a coupe and a bad bitch
And a Louie duffel bag with some cash in it
And a stupid ass crib somewhere out in the hills
So whenever I get bored I can crash in it
There’s a lot of bad hoes in my iPhone
Off white on, new mics on
And it’s hot outside, got my ice on
So fresh that I can’t leave the pipe home
All this cash once a young nigga do it
Everything in my pocket, Imma throw it
If he got his own squad I ain’t going
I ain’t worried bout nothing, bet I do it

[Hook]Fuego-go-go-go-go
(DJ Mustard speaking)

[Verse 1: Ty$]
I got all this money bout to leave with all these bitches

Pop one of these and wash it down how you like me now
Rose bottoms up, in VIP smoking up a cloud

[Hook]
Tell me what the fuck you gon' do

Nigga with so much dough
White tee in a Bentley

She gon' back it up right here on me

[Hook]
I'mma knock it down like I'm hittin free throws

Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down
And get closer to you

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Get a little closer to me too
You get a little shy when we start to move
Get a little high when I'm tryna decide if it's London or China too
Forget about the plans that you got later
I kiss you like you can't have too many
The Earth is like round and round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know
So in the meantime I'm here and I'm gone in love
Because you chose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

[Intermission x2]

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It's Kid Ink, uh

Roll up, I can spark that flame

Girl is you talkin' to me, whoa?
Let's start with the drink, pour up
Get you and your friends toe up
Don't sip slow on the low though
Wait, tell me what you here for
I could read the signal, girl, you bad, sinful
Body just like a centerfold
But you probably got a nigga though
If anybody ask, I don't know him
Couldn't just let you pass me and ignore it
Doin' all that cute shit
Took a couple shots and got shot by Cupid

[Hook x4][Produced by Devin Cruise]

[Hook: Kid Ink]

Yeah, but you will never catch me out of bounds
Or at home, it’s no guess I’m probably out of town
Cause my weight game is so Dwayne Wade
Getting money checks looking like a sweepstake
Pull up in a space ship star wars fly
With an all back diamond chain from the dark side
Lot of cheese like Swiss
Tell’em that it’s your time
Moneys all I talk and you ain't telling nothing like mine

Bat tat tat gang, bat gang bat tat gang
Bat gang, bat gang, bat gang, bat tat gang

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]

Motherfucker now it's on
Bat tat tat gang, undefeated since a nigga left the old team
H-H-Hands up, Super Bowl ring
A-A-Alumni bitch, 3 chains
Going global you lo-cal

No groupies in my room cause them hoes tell
Talks cheap and you niggas got it wholesale
All I do is win, know the goal well
So hot, think I might melt
Its nothing you can tell em that this easy I can finally feel my breezy swear that can't nobody see me in this muh fucka

[Hook: Kid Ink]

[Verse 2: Hardhead]

Wings out, let my fangs show
I ain't never been a fake type
Approach Ink in the wrong way get lit
One step like a break light
Bat gang watch it take flight
No sleep up late nights
Zombies, dead men walk right up outta that grave site
Styrofoam, d-double cup, bad bitch d-double D's
Belt and shoes got double G's
We the number one Big Mac with the double cheese
So what the fuck you thinkin'? Whoever you want just bring it
Because we shuttin' bars down like it's underage drinkin'
You ain't never catch me in the box stuck
Bitches ridin' my dick is the only way I'm fuckin' up
We took the long way and went the scenic route
Now we everywhere and we never ever see you out
You're tough talk get at me like Twitter nigga
Man wanna be in our shoes but they don't fit a nigga
Yeah, it's 4 B's and we in this
Bat gang bitch and all we do is big business

[Hook: Kid Ink][Hook: Kid Ink]
Everybody follow me back home
It's a after party full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
Follow me, back home
It's a after party full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Cause I'm tryna keep it on the low girl
Breezy, and I'm living in a cold world
Tryna get in, gotta know the code word
And I'll take one, but girl you gotta go first
Whole room moving like a lava lamp
Club full of bad girls, no oxygen
And you know it's going down, Nasdaq
Kobe on the blunt, you gotta pass that
We don't smoke those, you can ash that
I'm in the bathroom hiding from Kat Stacks
Drove here, but I'mma need a cab back
I got my money right, since you comparing that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I got they hands up, like a classroom
Can't see me like I got a mask on
Girls straight off the cover of Maxim
It's snow bunnies here, like we in Alaska
White girls, dyke girls
And she told you that she don't even like girls
Lying ass, I make that kitty purr
Since you can bring it back, go on hit reverse
It ain't no grenades, land mines
Gotta blend in, camouflage
You tripping girl, this ain't a Altoid
But it got me feeling like a cocaine cowboy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, money on my mind, what the fuck should I be thinking 'bout?
Purple drank and two Styrofoams is what I'm drinking out
The party's popping, as well as pills, I'm geeked bitch
The whole damn party's outta control, I'm in the bathroom with a freak bitch
Gudda ho, yeah that's my name, don't look at me, look at my chain
Walk in the party, shut down the party then pile the hoes in the black Range
All black tires, I'm the Batman
In the Batmobile, doors up, bat wings
I get a lot of money, what are you doing?
The hoes think I'm crazy, couple screws loose and
I party hard, we ain't sleeping 'til next afternoon
So follow me and swallow me it's a party in the bathroom

[Hook][Intro: DeJ Loaf]
You ain't got no whip, you ain't got no bottle
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
You ain't got no cash, you ain't got no dollas
You stay with that drama, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, just keep it real with ya
You the only nigga here feeling yourself
Walk in, them bitches start filming
They sittin' with a man, thotty ass still grinning, it's on
Honest, so hot, mind on a comet
Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic
I don't give a fuck, bitch with or without a condom
Fat Joe, pockets lean back like a recliner
I'm in this, representing West Side
Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Batgang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin'
Sippin' P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants
On the real

[Pre-Hook: Kid Ink]
You could call anyone you want
I'ma kill 'em all, bet on it
Said we the only ones that stuntin' now
Let's just be real

[Hook: DeJ Loaf & Kid Ink]
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Yeah let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, we all know the deal
So let's just be honest, let's just be real

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Uh, slow down babe
It's enough, to go round back
Been drinkin' like you thirsty
How you make it to my section in the first place
Nah, I ain't trippin', shit is nada
They say it ain't trickin' if you got it
Bitch I'm a boss like Gotti
Rock Tom Ford and I still pop Molly
Roll up good Cali, la di da di
It's just me and all my hommies
At your door like the shining, egh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga
And the bitch that I'm with know she hot stuff
Pull up in the hot wheels, ballin' get yo hops up
If you got a problem get a hotline
9-1-1 but we don't ever call the cops, for real

[Pre-Hook & Hook][Intro: DJ Tech]

Now tell me where do we go, we go, from here
I see so many manikins I gotta keep it real
Tryna play my cards right so you know just what the deal is
Just give me a second, I’ma show you how I feel man
Tell them that the truth... is
You’ve been around but you don’t know that I do…this
My lifestyle is so hostile it ain’t new…chick
Just hop in the fast lane and let’s move… quick
Everyday I’m gon’ quit and then I’m right back, right back
High up on this elevator, don’t do… stairs
I still see you stand, but I don’t need your stand
All these haters really my stance
Know I gotta keep it so fly, it’s only so much I can stand
No issues or pistols, just pussy all in my lap
I swear that head game on lock, I pray to God a nigga won’t trap
I tell her bite down, pitbull, if you tryna get on my level
You so bad girl you tryna get me in trouble
Now, tell me where do we go, we go from here
Its Kid Ink baby and Alumni in the building
Tell me where do we go, we go, from here
Just look up in the sky, I know you see me stupid high, tell ‘em
{Egh!}[Los talking]
Aye, like, like I traveled all over the world to see you baby like

[Hook: Sean Hayz and Los]
I'm like damn she cold
With an itty bitty mini skirt bad ass heels and a bag
And a bag she knows

Watch how ham she goes
When her song come on she gonna drop it to the floor like
Fuck what all these bitches say

[Verse 1: Los]
Ugh, swag, ugh

Glad I'm the one you putting on a show for
That short ass skirt and them long ass legs
Need a backstage pass when you going on tour
God damn that body screaming eat me up
Looking like a resses cup, chocolate and bcbg pumps
Dancing like a freaky slut, that slo motion that poetry
Climb that pole i'll throw a g, she said fuck that los just flow for me
Your voice make a bitch wanna drop it low for free, I said cool dip
She turned around and popped it I said oooh shit, she looked back at it
Told me gone ahead and smack it, dropped it to the floor like what ya waiting for you ain't gonna do shit?
Hold up wait, ugh what?, girl you got me fucked up
Gone let me fill my cup up, if I jump up in it I'mma go numb chucks
Thats bruce lee, you, me, swinging through the hood on duece three's

[Hook: Sean Hayz and Los]

Yup, ready for the show

Groupie love girl, can I hop on your bandwagon?
I got a bad habit, fucking with them bad bitches
Just want to see you go to work, c-call it bad business

Baby let me rock the boat
Cat got your tongue, but I got that pussy all in my throat
It's going down like the slopes
Tell me can you feel the breeze, I think I might need my coat

[Hook: Sean Hayz and Los][Hook: Kid Ink]
Girl, I see you with your friends and your ass out
Just left stage, bout to cash out
One more drink and I’ma pass out
Can’t nobody see me? It’s a blackout
Blackout, blackout, Blackout, blackout, Blackout
Can’t nobody see me? It’s a blackout
Blackout, blackout, Blackout, blackout, Blackout
If you getting money, pull your cash out!

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I said I’m turned up, maxed out
New money, but I just pulled a stash out
Huuuuh, couldn’t see me in a glass house
And my bitch way better than my last spouse
Hey, so tell me what you wanna do
Big bank take little bank
I’m Chase and bitch you are WAMU
I’m on some other shit, so can you please get off my stool
I am the man up in this bitch, I do it big, give me my room
Or I could give the business, but this right here is none of ya’ll
Nobody could fuck with me, it must be the nun in ya’ll
Watch me throw it up, throw it up cuz I can’t stomach ya’ll
I’m bout to take your bitch nigga and this is how I cum in her

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Diamond in my chain, Whoopi Goldberg, black as shit
Black Breitling all on my wrist, bitch I’m Bernie Mackin’ it
Get some Geicko for that ho, before it be an accident
Cuz I be shitting on these niggas, like I took a laxative
I bring a bitch down, like I break a brick down
Chopper with a drum, ho 86 rounds
I could make it rain and make a hater sit down
And I ain’t trying to save no chick, I’m trying to make a bitch drown
And I be swimming all in that money, diving all in that paper
Black phantom with no tint, styling out on them haters
Your team vs my team, Cavaliers vs. Lakers
I make a movie all on your bitch, scream free TIP I take her

[Hook][Verse 1]
Yeeaah , Uh
Come in where I wanna
Eyes wide shut, clothes reek of marijuana
It's stuffy up in here, got it looking like a sauna
Smoking kills, Terminator, you can call it Sarah Conner
Got you coughing, like you got a cold nigga

[Hook]
Fuck you doin? Blowin swishers

[Verse 2]
Man and I'm high as hell
Yeah my life is like a movie hope you got a still
I'm ill mufucka, I don't need a meal
But my pockets got the munchies and feed em well
Why your money lookin like it's on the diet pill?
I can eyeball that, I ain't gotta scale
Split it down, dump it nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And I'm tryna smoke with all of y'all
Rolling papers, man I feel like a ball hog
I can't pass that the way I hit
That's only one round, Mike Tyson
Ain't no papers in my house, I don't write shit
But your bitch is prolly here on a nightshift
Baby stop by the store, but I don't need liquor

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Cause I'mma get you high tonight
Once you learn how to roll, it's a riding bike
Said I'm over niggas heads on Cloud 9
Fuck what you got, my nigga smell mine
This ain't a art gallery, why everybody starin'?
Got a house full of bunnies where the fuck is Anna Faris?
I'm in the cut, you can keep your Rizla's

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
And I don't wanna hear that it tastes good
One hit of this, you feel it and your face good
We cookin baby you can meet me over here
Got everybodys eyes lookin' medium rare
How I'm comin on the beat is fucking really unfair
See the haters talk shit, but I really don't care
You can all suck a dick and feel it in your throat nigga

[Hook]
