Hook:
When the funk really go down
Who's really ready to ride
When the funk really go down
Who's really ready to ride

Everybody actin like they stack shit
And sell a bunch of packs
Strapped with full metal jackets
Really they be actors
Non-factors in this trap shit
Get hit with that mack
Spin 'em around backwards
Middle finger to them crackers
Left stranded on the pavement
If I went????
Bitch I'mma bang it
No more scary niggas squares ain't hangin
Pussies remain nameless, wishin they were famous
Dare a nigga say I ain't ride when the time came
I ain't bust mine, it must wasn't time
Crossed that line, if you touch one of mine
When it's really real, I'm the first one in line
So, when it's funk, gas up and keep your eyes open
Ridin around with no gun is how you die, though
It get trife in the town
When it go down them pussies won't be around

[Hook]

[Philthy Rich]
A nigga put 10 on my head like I ain't worth 50
Betta keep your receipts, you thinkin bout fuckin wit me
Play offense and defense, defense and offense
And no I can't sleep till that nigga in a coffin
Who really ready to ride, who really ready to slide
Like my Ice city niggas, bitches ho inside
4 5 6 shoutout bearfaced you know the real niggas ray lean and aj you know what it is nigga
From dogtown to 3rd world
Sem City Cypress Village
Acorn Hustalanity little niggas mobbing with us
5900 MAd Circle Free D and Tae (both locked up for murder)
11-5 , 900 , shouts out to brante
35 Ship them lane niggas we on aim niggas lets keep shit a hunnid
Thats where you got you fame from us
First u wasn't riding
Now i guess you mobbing
Get up on these track and do a whole bunch of lying

[Hook][Hook]
[X3]I know I got these haters mad, I can love that
When you got love for the streets they give you love back

Look in my eyes, you can tell I ain't never scared
Popping them thangs, I'm rocking my chain anywhere

[Verse 1: A Plus Tha Kid]

Look up in the sky: it's a bird, it's a plane
What's that nigga name? It say it on his chain
Vogues on the wheels, still gripping on the grain
Cashed out for the yandy and spray it on the frame
Blame it on the game; niggas hating, what a shame
Getting it around the world while you waiting for the fame
120 on the bo, pour another four
Gotta have mine though, for the halftime show
I'mma let it be known: boy a bitch ain't nothing
I'm from the part of town where the pimps ain't cuffing
Gangstas ain't telling, we ain't never saying nothing
I love to just listen when the russian K busting
Shitting on 'em stay flushing; Shady Nate and A Plussin'
Before I ever started rapping I was hustling
And we don't ever change our minds, we just adjust them
Come through tryna crush them, everything custom...

(Hook)

[Verse 2: Shady Nate]

For roaches I spray pesticide, and all the rest could ride
My cream machine make fiends do the electric slide
Fuck talking about the money and let's collide
Push up on the block and get your lyrical exercise
Rocking with my cock out, that just mean the Glock out
It's smacking at the trap house, so I'mma take the back route
Bitches in the kitchen whipping with titties and ass out
I turned her to a marketing genius during my last drought
Plenty green by any means, give me money or give me lean
They know about that lean team, propane game and them beam things
From Folsom up to Sing SIng, Fresno to Oakland
Pistol promoting, look in my eyes it's no joking
Stay smoking the best of grapes, lil nigga pour up (syrup)
Planes, trains and thangs, another city to sow up
But so what? Shoulder to shoulder you see the tat
I got love in the hood so I'm giving it back

(Hook)

[Verse 3: A Plus Tha Kid]

A Plus and Shady Nate, running like it's '88
Beating down your block, slapping clapping off your lady ?
Niggas mad at the paint, cause it make the hoes faint
Suckas wanna try to end me but can't, I'm well trained
No backing down, I ain't; tryna play me I'm going mainey though
Mama's only living sons, put that on my aunty though
Rest in peace Oakland Spodie, just bought a truck; E-40
And beat the case because the people had nothing on me
Real shit fuck a phony, no friends all fam
Straight up out the Ranchwood, fuck doing the talking
I'm just tryna ball man, put me in the game coach
Hanging out the Range Rove I can let the thang go
Murdering from my angle, stripes like a Bangle
Do this for the bangers with monitors on they ankle
I know I got the haters mad, I could love that
When you got love in the streets they give you love back...

(Hook)[Intro.]
Hold up Racks! Cool that money counter off
Play another mixtape mob exclusive
Lean wit me man. This my bo' song baby
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout. That purple, that red
East to the West you're now rocking with the mixtape mob motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Dubbe-20]
I got a fo' take yo' ass to the sto' and bitch hurr' up
All I like to do is get dough and drink syrup
Dump it in the 2 liter Sprite before I stir up
Here take a couple of kisses but don't murder my mix
Stingy when it comes to that codeine
Junkie for the prometh', guess I'm a bo' fiend
Get it from the dope fiends they trade it for more cream
Only purple and the red, cause that yellow shit be morphine
See bruh? I'm hooked like an addict
Keep it in the freezer, not the medicine cabinet
Doctor prescribed to get high when I want
I eat it on my waffles and smoke it on my blunts, uh-huh
It make the weed burn slow
Everytime I fuck with [?] we pour up
Everytime I ride with royal we be sippin'
Sleepy but never slippin' grape flavor on my lips, man

[Hook X2: K Breeze]
If you're rollin' with my team
You hustlin' in these streets
Gettin' money all day, sippin' bottles of lean
We stay hustlin', leanin', smokin', leanin'
Ridin' we leanin' my whole team we leanin'

[Verse 2: Shady Nate]
A true bo-fessional, leanin' and countin' money
'bo and Sprite on ice whenever the weather's sunny
You can lean with the kid-kid when your 'tussin dry
Make sure you return the favor when you see I ain't high
I tip it like Dubb-20, I guzzle like Brunna Banna
Pulled up with that brick of that 'tussin
Them hoes went bananas, it's a celebration
When I get my hands on it
If you ain't really on it and ask me I don't condone it
It's a privilege like Hennesy, the syrup's the remedy
I hear you can make a killin' if you dealin' in Tennessee
Recipe's Pimp C, and shout out to the Jets
I'm a be tippin' on the syrup 'till my last breath
The feeling's mutual, if you think it's beautiful
So I made an album 'bout my favorite pharmaceutical (bo-fessional!)
And when I get it I sip it just for the team
If you up in my circle with that purple, my nigga then you gone lean[Intro.]
