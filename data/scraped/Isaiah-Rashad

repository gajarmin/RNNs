[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, click boom the ghetto bird get shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my background
But nah homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue, chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two, or maybe trois
Baby girl need a papa, I be her dada
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron, Rock

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if we ain't talking to you, mind your business then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that "YAWK," watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg we runnin' rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don't run with cats
Nine double O five nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van holding tools like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide your feelings, now can I live?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
Cause everywhere I go they like "When you dropping some work?"
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm droppin' the hearse
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Industry's nightmare, red strings in my Nike Airs
Yeah, the white pair, I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My charges? Killing MC's without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing a sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Probably why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, what's the difference?
We all gon' die one day, until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of OG
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess it's just a balance we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep, Soul brother number two
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the S550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L's move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it's your little nigga brother
You ain't meant for corners, it's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a shell in the bag
Fat as elephant ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we diamond just shining and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with your bitch
For the record in Guinness I'm a hecklin' menace
Where is Robin, I'm Given', fuckin' minding my business
He a regular victim, of some regular in women
Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I put your motherfuckin' dream in your face
You keep lookin' for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me, cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't  underlooked
You ain't overbooked, you just undercooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the record book
Now they got me out here by myself still fresh as fuck

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all, shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy 'til I'm unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes, I kick ass and then kick knowledge
I'm way more polished than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I'm about to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah, and nothing's been the same since they dropped Control
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip Hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like master Geoffrey
Jump on the curb, turn a shotty to a verb if you let me
You know I'm a killer, I'm on your head, you know I'm a killer
The West Coast Cosa Nostra under oath 'til it's over
You over owe us, so what the fuck?
I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up, she suck and fuck
I fuckin' duck you fuckin' niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts
Acting irrational, pop you then pop an Adderall
Know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth, racing my thoughts on embracing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hating
Quite frankly your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick?
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Emaculate tactics so follow me, if you need me just call on me
I say "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it!"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
Unless you look like Jordin Sparks, make my mark on the clitoris, muah
Hollywood's been good to me, lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building spilling its Merlot
Fillin' women, a Virgo, pimp the industry
Remember these Stacy Adams and furcoats
Shook, you're scared to death, you're scared to look
In the mirror when Kendrick is near you

[Verse 1]
Now, everybody tellin' me a lie
Lordy, give me something for my soul
See, I don't wanna think of suicide
So please don't take the lock key off my door
See, I've been tired of fucking all these girls
And I've been tired of spending all my dough
And if I give my story to the world
I wonder if they'd book me for a show
See you can't handle pressure on your own
So why you carry boulder by yourself?
The story’s storyteller tell it wrong
And glorify the horror and the wealth
And Mama call me, tell me coming home
And I just need some guidance in my steps
I know I'm not the only one alone
I know I'm not the only one who felt

[Hook: SZA]
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm praying that I make it twenty-five
They be calling doctors for my health
And "no" is kinda hard to say to drugs
Cause I been having problems with myself
And I been asking questions, where the love?
And they don't give me answers, just a check
And they don't know my issues as a child
Cause I was busy cutting on myself
And hanging from the playground wasn't wrong
Until you got a rope around your neck
And I been losing more than just my mind
Gathering what's left of self-respect
And Daddy, why you call me while you're drunk?
And why you never love me when I need it?
And I don't wanna be like you no more
And I been trying to cope, I'm getting weeded

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I smoke too much: The problems of a twenty-something
I drink too often, there's liquor pouring from the faucet
You would assume by following the tunes
That I'm doomed to die young, addicted to dry plum
These bitches ain't shit, and pussy is my greatest vice
I love smoking weed, I hate advice
I know some niggas that talk good
The wise men from a long line of bitch-made and brides-men
You never had nothing but fucking dreams
You just caught up in the hype
The fashion and so it seems, the limelight
I know that I rhyme tight
No need for your two cents and burning your blueprints
These people think I really give a fuck about the shit they give a fuck about
Just need a moment of silence, just close your fuckin' mouth
Infatuated with violence, gun in my fuckin' mouth
So you don't even know that I'm serious, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Like you got punchlines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
And you got punch lines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
Yeah, and I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
And they souls was never in it, like
And I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
They souls was never in it, like...[Produced by Chris Calor and The Antydote]

[Verse 1]
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, is reflecting my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, roll model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't popping shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
If I ain't meant to shine, beat me up in a rhyme spot
No crying 'til I'm in pine box
I got the bitches hitting Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fucking on her friend, probably L.A. at
Probably plotting on a mil staying where Fay at
Bitch don't run your mouth we don't play that
Mama taught me better, can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather, go figure nigga
They ain't worried about this cheddar
Them niggas just sky diving in my propellers, I don't feel 'em
Ain't trying to be no freshman, I'm chilling
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and not kill 'em
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing
To bring a little ho to the party and Meek Mill 'em
I feel like talking my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick

[Bridge]
I'm praying for some good rappers and a fleetwood
Why I gotta bring my A game? You just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows corn rows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes and I ain't even tripping
Cause we'll be laughing to the bank and riding by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fucking trunk and bring the party with me

[Hook]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Everything takes time
Is you selling or you buying nigga? Get rich or die trying
Yay yay on the stove, I had the choppers in the Cutlass
Just a young nigga tryna get some hundreds
I had a little bucket, yeah, I rode it like a benz
Yeah I spent my little ends on that Butlass
Tell me who you trust
Look I got my faith in God cause these clown ass niggas all bustas
These niggas not Jesus, they ain't gonna die for you
And only time will tell what's gon' lie for you
It's funny right what a couple lies will do
But seeing is believing what defines the truth
I keep shooters on the wing when I'm riding through
And if niggas out of bounds they gon probably shoot
Cause killing is the hobby
Eastside niggas, yeah, we known for catching bodies
I used to have a deuce five riding on the trolly
On my way to school like dare nigga try me
Look, cause where I'm from I'm a blood on an island
Surrounded by blue water, sharks all around me
Pigs on my ass, hoes tryna drown me
Niggas know I'm up so these haters wanna down me
Niggas know I'm king but they don't wanna crown me
It's okay, I ain't 'bout to whine about it
Look, a real nigga for real nigga, now check it
I'm still here I'm still counting my blessings
With no chains on, with no rings on
Watching these fake rappers, getting my aim on
Pop a shot, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
And watch 'em fall like confetti, fuck 'em all (fuck 'em all)
It's just me and my niggas taking over the game
And since I conquered this craft, nothing will be the same

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Not a dollar on me, this home invasion a payday
Two time felon they jerking me on my pay rate
Slaving all these hours but couldn't shake that my rent late
Making eight an hour I'm leaning towards my AK
Moms thinks I'm vicious, don't want me round the kitchen
My living room, bathroom, my bedroom was evicted
Missing from your homeroom my good grades was cripping
Before I even learned division, nigga I learnt the mission
See I'm from where fiends scratch that itch, won't hit the lotto
And I'm from where fiends fix that fix and not a  bottle
And that little nigga that missed that bottle gon' catch a hollow
Or maybe even throw him pyro, pyro
See this set don't make too many niggas rich that I know
You either gang bang, sell dope or bet on the four
See money on the ground, my eyes glued to the floor
I double deuce by my toe, see Figg get it and go
I feel stuck in my ways, a nigga just tryna get paid
I'm tired of answering questions why Oxymoron delayed
See I was thinking November, but January is sweet
It set my setbacks free, my habits won in my sleep
So January agree, get a taste of this gangsta
See I'm just tryna eat, with a freak of the week
I'm just tryna hit 'em and leave 'em, dog, they yours for the keep
But don't be kissing them broads, my sperm on their teeth
Last night was nothing, this morning I'm a hero
No belief in me, dawg, they said I'd mount to zero
Cocaine, cocaine, rock, rock kilo
Fishscale, cut well, you won't find Nemo
Pull up to the block and they call me real nigga
See I can be a real nigga, but my daughter see me bigger
See a body full of love and yours full of liquor
But you'll always be my nigga, said you'll always be my nigga

[Intro: SZA]
Hey, hey glory child, hey

[Verse 1: SZA]
Hey glory child, don't you worry
Stuttering, shaken off your fear
Beauty's never given in a hurry
So condescending, leave your questions here
Hey glory child, don't you worry
I can see your skeleton so clear
Doubting's only made your visions blurry
You're better off just looking in the mirror

[Hook: SZA]
Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today, you could
Come home today

[Verse 2: SZA]
I am shooting stars you will never see me
Watching over your every mistake
Digging out of graves is never easy
Handing you my shovel, here to take
Always playing catch me if you can
Gingerbread you heard I'm sweet to taste
Close your eyes let go and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

Dear God make me a bird, so I can fly far, far far away
Dear God make me a bird, so I can fly far, far far away
Dear God make me a bird, so I can fly far, far far away

Call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

[Hook: SZA & Isaiah Rashad]
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
Whats happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like...
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
Whats happening to we?
Warm Winds on a space ride

[Verse 1: SZA]
Sometimes, I call your name out loud
Just to make sure it's you
Sometimes, I crack my veins open
Just to see if it's blue
You clean me up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SZA]
Sometimes I bite my lips and close my eyes
Just to pretend it's you
Long live, lonely thoughts on Thursday nights
That's when I think of you
We were all thirteen once
Long live tramp stamps and Pepper Ann
You will never judge me for that
You will always love me for that

[Outro: SZA]
Warm Winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had taste like...

[Hook]
Now can we fall in love while
Southernplayalistic banging through the night?
(Fall in love, through the night)
And I ain't ever felt no type
Of way about this living, do or die
(Type of way, do or die)
And when they see our age they say
We're young, I'll let you push me to the side
(Push me to the side)
At least we fell in love
With something greater than debating suicide
(At least we fell in love)

[Bridge]
How you feeling, baby?
How you feeling, baby?
I travel for you
I battle for you
Cause I love to call your name
I travel for you

[Verse 1]
Now can we fall in love while
Southernplayalistic burning through the night?
And I ain't ever felt no type
Of way about this living, do or die
(Type of way, do or die)
And when they see our age they say
We're young, I'll let you push me to the side
At least we fell in love

[Intro]
It's The House

[Hook 8x]
Y'all live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money

[Verse 1]
Alright, now if I die today, bitch my legacy is straight
I'm the best they never heard, I'm your brother, just relate
I need diamond teeth, livin' like it's 1998
Like when Percy was the king, back when Juvie was the great
Bitch this doobie is the bait, Patton taught me how to pimp
Like one day you here, then gone, that's why Chad was downin' shrimp
I've been ridin' out, since I thought my Huffy was the shit
Chattanooga pool of sharks, don't you slip and lose a limb
Slow it down, we losin' 'em, I've been on the booze again
Shit, that sober livin' Hell, free Guwop if he in jail
Nigga taught me 'bout the scale, it was vivid, I was there
I was on my first offense, I hope they gon' give me bail
Screamin' mothafuck a 12, bitches ain't shit
Cops ain't neither, they huntin' my people
Codeine I'm back, leanin', I cope with my demons
The best is not perfect, the rest is not worth it, wake up!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hey bitch I'm back, quit the whinin', bring it back, oochie wally
This the set? It's that mothafuckin' bet, who designed it?
This the one, how you make it out of Chat, who can fly yah
I'm the prince, it was written in the book, Jeremiah
I got dreams, I got bitches, I got hooks, you can buy 'em
Fresh and clean, that Stankonia had me hooked as a child
Used to think my ambition was a scheme, I defy 'em
You can too, if you get up off your ass, fucking try it
I'm a slave, I'm just tryna make the top fall off
On the whip, like a cannon, lollipop on y'all
Xanny ho get me high, make me feel so tall
I'm tryna keep my mental ground and so I feel for y'all
I swear my eyes be bloody red, but bitch I feel amazing
And this is not a confrontation, that's an understatement
See this is runnin' in your house and where your momma staying
You spending doja on some pussy, you ain't concentratin', just wake up!

[Hook][Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Lot of grievances and wish tales on the wrong niggas
K's sound like grey hounds, they long winded
Week start, high school sweetheart, what's wrong with him?
Black snake moan, tre-eight long as bone tissue
Lay on side my son and he's like ''Daddy, what's wrong?''
Few elusive habits, won't consider marriage I'm gone
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, had like cheap liquor
Slipped then got back on my feet like C. Billups
I done lost my money gambling, loudmouth rambling
Did a lot of lying 'til my women couldn't stand it
Nigga killed my brother so I took him from his family
Went and got some tears in my face, now I'm branded
All I ever wanted was some money like Sandy
Louise Vuitton shades for my dame, life fancy
Sweet face then I lick her pussy like nasty
But I ain't like her boyfriend if you was just asking

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Wait, who is this?
Ayo, wait, I don't know
I'm doing this XXL shit, I can't really talk on the phone right now

Smack called me, I was getting some head
He said ''come do this XXL cover instead''
I said ''for sure, bust a bitch on the bed
Bust a nut on her head, tell me when and where and it's dead''
In the moment feels like a rush don't it?
Me hopping on the plane to fly to New York with no advance
From my non-existent label to spend
Money I'm spent, funded my tour in Europe
Paid it for myself
When a bunch of nigga's labels probably paid for the spot
I don't know, maybe not, could've been genuine
I laugh at Mr.Rogers in the hood
Told him why these niggas is brokeboys, they need reassembling
I'm Wimbledon, used to be innanet, now I'm a free man like Morgan
Free agent, three agents, the A&R man and a midget on my foreskin
Hey, Kobe, tell me how my ass taste
They should save my shit for the outtakes
I might take everyone out, flee the scene with the murder weapon
And a dick in your mouth, feet on your couch and my middle finger's up With my fucking Timb spot cause I don't give a fuck

[Hook: August Alsina]
Be on my grind and my hustle all day
Baby, I'mma shine, keep it bright always
And I be on the grind on the block all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
And baby I'mma shine like a light always
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day, yeah

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Look, I'm on this XXL getting this paper
What I told her, she was slick as a fox
Sweet as the cadence, tell me, baby, you gon' love me or not?
With my dick in her mouth
I'm just chilling, my eyes glued to the ceiling
Just imagine getting closer to God
My uncle tried to stand on money then grab on something
Then have no knots and have no nothings and can't afford that
Swerving, just left service with Aunt Berlin
The Drama got her busy, this tenant is cart serving
Serving a junkie, maybe his family or something
That said that math just be exquisite when we pimping them bitches
Don't twist a cabinet in the kitchen unless you working them riches
Hold up, but we continue, we ain't washing no dishes
Laughing niggas laughing to the cashier
I don't really give a fuck
Getting to acting baffled, should not crash ya
Told you you'd get it, nigga

[Verse 4: Chance The Rapper]
Young black boy, how he got the labels scared?
A&R's be like "Chano, you ain't playin fair"
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear
You a yogi, you should idle while in child's position
I be like, naw, these my sons, this prenatal care
I'mma show 'em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than ableton
Make a plate and make it player, make 'em play it
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch
You chickens ‘fore your eggs or eat 'fore you say your prayer

[Hook][Verse]
Baby hold my chalice, this some pimp shit
This that stay over with my daddy and his mistress
I could drink hundred proof a gallon, fuck a kidney
Fuck with me, I just want some balance and some bitches
Fuck a dream, I say anything is realistic
I see a challenge Imma gun it down like it offend me
I suppose, Lordy take my vision off the pussy hole
Few are chose, God I wanna say it, but they took it wrong
Back the hoes, can I change the world with Cadillacs and Volks?
Can I breed it like we need it like we back to back we bought?
I don't want my child to grow up feeling like his daddy gone
Daddy left, feeling just like me I'm waiting on your steps
What is blessed?
How I end up rapping, how we feeling stressed?
Shit I'm back to burgers in the locals if you ain't impressed
I need motivation, all I'm asking is you bring your best
Rain is just another confrontation, know that life a bitch
Life is this[Produced by Flying Lotus]

[Verse 1]
Two pills and a Mac-11, red, blue, you choose
Tryna spit a few flows to get my money up
Look I'm 20 years old and I ain't done enough
And 'til the sun set, roll another blunt for my real nigga Kembe
I'm not only the leader but I follow the village
I swear them niggas is killing it in Chicago
Now put the gun down, waiting to put the world on 'em
I get tired of the problems and depression
The bitches and the bitching, come and get your girl, homie
Shallow dreams and broken hearts, Black Benz's
They're tryna make, material wishes and spiritual blisses
They stay focused on inferior pictures, you got your mothafuckin' hands out

[Hook]
I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang

[Verse 2]
Two kills from a Mac-11, red and blue, you lose
A nigga need bail so get your money out
I'm twenty years old and I ain't done enough
Lord, I swear I got the answers for my people, and bullets bring the reaper
I heard my first lie in a church from a preacher
I sank low cause that's where they want to keep us
Just give me love, give me sex, give me reefer
And after school getting high with the teachers
I tried to promise my momma I'd make it honest
Say what's on your heart I promise they call it conscience
And conscience don't make no dollars, no dollars unless you Common
Now get your mothafuckin' hands out

[Hook (2X)]We were first put on to your music by Kembe X down at SXSW this year… can you explain that relationship for us?

We met over twitter and he dissed my music over an email. He’s the only artist to give me criticism over my flows. We met in February and ever since then we’ve been brothers. I’m closer to him musically than anyone. We go through the same things

It’s usually a safe bet to assume UGK as an influence of anyone with that Southern Rap style, does that hold true with you? Who else would you list as an influence?

I grew up on UGK, but I was more of an 8ball & MJG, Outkast, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, and Master P fan. Master P is really the guy who made me want to rap. I was a stan for him as a kid. Erykah Badu is my life though. Her music is my favorite out of everything. Every album. World Wide Undergroud is my favorite

(Question #3 removed 11/24/13)

One of SBG’s contributors, DJ Eternity, has been up on your music for longer than any other blogger we know and he’s based out of Pittsburgh. What’s it like having your music noticed all across the country?

I didn’t even know he was from Pixburgh. He posts all my stuff, from the lil singles to the soundcloud joints. Its a blessing honestly though. It lets me know that theres still room for people like us to thrive. I didn’t have to make jingles to get on The Smokers Club Tour. I love everybody for that

I’ve noticed you’re very good about getting your lyrics up on RapGenius and taking the time to explain them – something we love from a fan standpoint. As an artist, what makes you put in this extra effort?

You deserve to know that I’m not putting a bunch of words together for the sake of putting words together. Rap Genius is great for that. You can’t say bullshit now! Its gonna end up looking stupid in front of thousands, not just sound stupid[Intro]
I'm dark skinned so please don't take me lightly
Stogie in my hand, begging, "Please light me"
Again, don't this feel like '96 or '95?
It was in his hand with this dude, while I drive

[Verse 1]
Pass out in the sheets with a freak, should I creep with her?
I'm too tired, we don't fuck, I just sleep with her
And baby momma's still pasty
She found the rubbers in my dresser (God bless her)
Third trimester I don't really wanna stress her
So daddy will deny her, orgasms I supply 'em
To the women that inspired all the rhymes I wrote
And kill millions of civilians with the nines I tote
I'm just young, dumb and ignorant
I couldn't go to college so I settled to be a nigga then paper chasing
I wonder if the government formulating
This chemistry that got 'em rich niggas paper racist
It seems that I'm a goner, so I escape aromas
Of that hate with weed and marijuana
And conforming is what I'm living with
Cause you die if you different, and now I'm smoking

[Outro]
And don't this feel like '95 nigga...[Produced by The Antydote]

[Intro]
I gotta kinda sing it

[Verse 1]
Yo, now ever since I was young, had a gift for the tongue
This shit might open the door (it might open the do')
Fruit loop for the young, honeycomb for some
22 put piff in a bowl (put piff in a bowl)
And I was bending the corners, hot boxin' the sauna
I've been focused gettin' closer to ghosts (gettin' closer to ghosts)
And I be slippin' a bit, probably sippin a bitch
I ain't really into tippin' the hoes
See my brother got weight, my sister at home (yeah yeah)
When I get straight my sister gettin flown (yeah yeah)
Couple nephews, my niggas gettin' grown (yeah yeah)
Mikey D stay down, nigga gettin on (yeah yeah)
Can I get a, glass cup and a lil' Henny (yeah yeah)
I'm, too cold but a little timid (yeah yeah)
I, blow checks save a lil' penny (yeah yeah)
I'm too young for some big money (ooh)
Come girl get some dick from me (ooh)
My job needs some piss from me (ooh)
Uhn, lil bro can you fuck with me (yeah yeah)
Came through at the last minute (yeah yeah)
Living, wasting my time
Lacing with percs, purp in a bind
Hazy, oh baby, I'm better when blind
I don't see nothin' this perfect can fine (yeah yeah)

[Hook]
We are the young and Xanax, oh
See, there's nowhere to go
To hide from the lows
Cause we are the young and Xanax, oh
See, there's nowhere to go
Stuck on the high, yeah

[Verse 2]
My son sleep, I'm rollin it up, I don't sleep (rollin' it)
I'm runnin' for bucks, don't tweet (runnin for)
You fuckin' with us, I won't eat (fuckin' with)
Start stomping your feet, I need that
Depending on all of you feedback
Come out to my show and come feed that
Can't go back to sellin' that retail
My daddy left me with no details
Came back with a bitch and his stepson
I guess he forgot that he left somethin'
He must have been saving the best bum (yeah yeah)
She screaming out "Give me the rest, hun" (yeah yeah)
Pearl neckless I empty my left nut (yeah yeah)
Most niggas can't fuck with my worst shit (yeah yeah)
I'm scribing my living with curses (yeah yeah)
Just wait till I get this shit perfect (yeah yeah)
You niggas can't fuck with my verses (yeah yeah)
See, they really don't think that I'm bout this (yeah yeah)
Don't make me come run in your houses (yeah yeah)
We know where your mom and your dad lives (yeah yeah)
Ooh baby, yes wait just mask us (yeah yeah)
My niggas got triggas and vastly (yeah yeah)
Don't like how we living it lasts (yeah yeah)
You out of your trigger and backseat (ooh)
Just looking at the shooter, it's Mike D (ooh)
Your rosary shining so nicely (ooh)
We innocent kids if you ask me (ooh)
I rode in the Benz in the backseat (yeah yeah)
Them vices they swarm and attack me (yeah yeah)
Got diamonds and niners upon me (yeah yeah)
That Juvie, that Percy, that Bun B (yeah yeah)
Soundtrack in the back while we dumping (yeah yeah)

[Hook][Produced by Havoc]

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, click boom the ghetto bird get shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my background
But nah homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue, chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two, or maybe trois
Baby girl need a papa, I be her dada
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron, Rock

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if we ain't talking to you, mind your business then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that "YAWK," watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg we runnin' rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don't run with cats
Nine double O five nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van holding tools like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide your feelings, now can I live?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
Cause everywhere I go they like "When you dropping some work?"
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm droppin' the hearse
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Industry's nightmare, red strings in my Nike Airs
Yeah, the white pair, I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My charges? Killing MC's without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing a sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Probably why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, what's the difference?
We all gon' die one day, until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of OG
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess it's just a balance we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep, Soul brother number two
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the S550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L's move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it's your little nigga brother
You ain't meant for corners, it's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a shell in the bag
Fat as elephant ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we diamond just shining and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with your bitch
For the record in Guinness I'm a hecklin' menace
Where is Robin, I'm Given', fuckin' minding my business
He a regular victim, of some regular in women
Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I put your motherfuckin' dream in your face
You keep lookin' for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me, cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't  underlooked
You ain't overbooked, you just undercooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the record book
Now they got me out here by myself still fresh as fuck

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all, shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy 'til I'm unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes, I kick ass and then kick knowledge
I'm way more polished than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I'm about to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah, and nothing's been the same since they dropped Control
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip Hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like master Geoffrey
Jump on the curb, turn a shotty to a verb if you let me
You know I'm a killer, I'm on your head, you know I'm a killer
The West Coast Cosa Nostra under oath 'til it's over
You over owe us, so what the fuck?
I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up, she suck and fuck
I fuckin' duck you fuckin' niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts
Acting irrational, pop you then pop an Adderall
Know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth, racing my thoughts on embracing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hating
Quite frankly your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick?
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Emaculate tactics so follow me, if you need me just call on me
I say "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it!"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
Unless you look like Jordin Sparks, make my mark on the clitoris, muah
Hollywood's been good to me, lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building spilling its Merlot
Fillin' women, a Virgo, pimp the industry
Remember these Stacy Adams and furcoats
Shook, you're scared to death, you're scared to look
In the mirror when Kendrick is near you

[Intro: Kent Jamz]
Hands on the table, oh ya
You killed my uncle back in eighty-three
Guns on the table, oh ya
You killed my daddy back in ninety-three

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
I seen too much and I'm just twenty three
I know some killers born in ninety-six
I take it back ,I'll teach you how to swim
I reminisce, I remi-
I reminisce like I was eighty five
Behind your dollar sign and tinted screen
I reminisce, I remi-
I reminisce
I know you, I know you hurt
I know you love me, I know the [?] it breaks my heart
I know you love me, I know you hurt some
I know what love is, I know you

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & Kent Jamz]
I know the black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black blood, keep the sunshine, on your face, I know
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black blood, black blood
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto (I know)
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto (I know)
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black blood (black blood), I know (I know)

[Verse 2: King Los]
They killed my pop when I was just sixteen (Oh no no)
They took my innocence away from me (No no no)
In my hood I done did some crazy things (Oh no no)
But that's all the shit that made me a king (No no no)
Cause I still see the sun rise, and the moon shine
I look in my son's eyes, and I'm grateful two times
And two types of niggas from I'm from, and they both the same
Know yourself, know the streets, know the game, know the pain
Novocain make me numb, know the chains make me numb
Chain me to my brother, hate each other 'til we eighty something
Make me run from myself, this like my own flesh
So we on bullshit, just like I'm on [?]
Oh yes, time's hard, you all stressed, your mind's gone
Going through a large test, hard-pressed to find God, define God
Look in the mirror, you might find God
Even though we full of sin we full of him, defy odds
My scars match his as long as I've been beat down
I should have nails through my hands and my feet now
He was on the cross said speak, now I'm hearin' you
Saved by the blood, he might leak down the mirror quick
Gotta be the-

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & Kent Jamz]
I know the black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black blood, keep the sunshine, on your face, I know
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black blood, black blood
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto (I know)
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto (I know)
Black blood, make the grass grow, in the ghetto
Black blood (black blood), I know (I know)

[Outro]
In the ghetto (Ghetto)
Black blood, make the grass grow
Ohhh, ohhh (Ohhh)
Ohhh, black blood (In the ghetto)
(Ghetto) Black blood, ohhh

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Yo now it's just me, my nigga Mikey D, gettin' throwed
We was bangin' out some Masta P, on the road
I prefer my word with platinum teeth, maybe gold
They don't like it when you come direct, well fuck, but Spottie bold
Tell them hoes they better come correct, cause I fuck
My momma told me we no 'ceptin' any memberships, no adding losses
I won't step up in your dealership until I'm flossin'
We no flexy with the funk, add a blessing to that punk
Damn, I got a son he on the way, but that's my baby
I've been spittin' like it's crack or some, like since the 80's
I was born I think in '91, that mean I'm chosen
When I slide back through your hood, bitch, just have a frozen, bitch

[Hook]
Yeah, Goddamn, feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Goddamn, my man, feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Scarface somethin', like I'm Brad Jordan
Feel like I'm the fuckin', feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental
In Houston, OPM on them pussy ass niggas
Feel like I'm Brad, Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental

[Bridge: Isaiah Rashad]
Now you would think I work from South Park, grindin', always makin' trouble
Grippin', on another level, mothafucka
I feel like droppin' classics, like the rucker
And rappers be too passive

[Verse 2: Michael Da Vinci]
It's just me, my brother Spottie, bitch, sit low
I've been drinkin' since my momma called, around 4
Niggas asking me too many questions, fuckin' throwed
Rob Da Vinci, Mike December we was losing, now we winnin'
Can I sport a couple in this, play for bucks, that Brandon Jennings
Wear your crown and your pocket, or that shit'll come up missin'
You that nigga but the misses, eat a dick and mind ya business
This for all my Eastside niggas who be eating, do no sleeping
For their seedlin', never go to parties even if it is the weekend
And shout-out to the women who be faithful to their pimpin'
And shout-out to them haters who be all up in their feelins
And shout-out to my daddy, I'mma buy your ass a Bentley

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Outro: Isaiah Rashad]
A bunch of bustas
I'm on everybody's asses, and this the notice
And I ain't even tryin', ho, did you notice?
And this the standard, uh fuckin' bogus, uh
You fuckin' rappers, uh, it's just me and my nigga Mike D
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental
In Houston, OPM on them pussy ass niggas
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental
In Houston, OPM on them pussy ass niggas

[Skit: Isaiah Rashad & Michael Da Vinci]
I swear
Lemme get a peach Faygo
Bring the muthafuckin' frozen through bitch, man I told you so
Ay yo, the piece, the piece, the piece and not in the, what they call it, the cans nigga
Not that can shit, not that can shit
Not the cans, I want a bottle nigga
Get the bottle from motherfuckin' right through the Wilcox Tunnel
Bring that bottle right through there
That peach kind? That peach kind
Tell that bitch to bring me a strawberry kiwi, bring me a mothafuckin' frozen
I need, I need one of those three for one bags of Flamin' Hot Cheetos
I prefer if you bought the popcorn
The popcorn, the popcorn
And if you can't bring the popcorn, bring the mothafuckin' hot fries
And if you can't bring the hot fires, go ahead and bust that five out
And bring me some Mapco chicken bitch
Yeah, slam dunk and some Mapco[Produced by The Antydote]

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad (2X)]
One time for the real niggas, one time for the little niggas
We climb for the thrill of it, rewind to the feel of it
No crime, just a little money
One time for the caged bird, one time for the vapors
Slow dance on the Jager, one time for the vapors, yeah

[Verse 1: Kembe X (Isaiah Rashad)]
Okay my conscience hit me with some common sense and so I consequently came through (Now I’m here)
Up and drop your shit, and leave your momma crib is something lots of niggas can’t do (No sir)
They wanna crack a card, they wanna cop a pistol, pop molly pills and let loose
I’m tryin’ to be the plug, they tryin’ to shop with them
So it ain't shockin’ when you see they pockets thin and that’s funny
Lately every move these niggas makin' just ain't makin' no sense
Wanted change but ain't breakin' no singles
Wanna get it but can't take a hint
I'mma run it eventually, I'm chasin' it right now because every race ain't a sprint (right)
We humans in they defense, I be sinnin' too much to repent (true shit)

[Bridge: Isaiah Rashad (Kembe X)]
Sometimes my body feel like a cage (feel like a cage)
And if I bomb I'll probably sip on some 'Jäge (sip on some 'Jäge)
Since a little nigga I've been on that one love
Keep it a buck, A.D.D really sums up
Odd little nigga tryin' to even it up
It's too easy, you need to give up, lil' bitch (lil' bitch)

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad (2X)]

[Verse 2: Kembe X]
So one time for my niggas that be ridin' for they niggas
Livin' life like it was designed for they niggas
I'm a livin' light, stuck up in this whole little maze
Me and you don't think alike, I got my own little lane
Own little problems, pressures, vices, reflect on the lovely little lesson, life is
Learned to be wrong and I earned plenty stripes
And returned pretty strong, what a blessing
I just want a Lexus, I just want a sign
They droppin' out was reckless but shit I'm doin' fine
Tryin' to be a legend, promised I would radiate perfection
That was when the seven's had aligned
All of this is destined
Look up in the stars everything is your perception
Use it as a weapon
Heavy into winnin' niggas doomed to be second
It's just me and my Village, ain't no room to be freshmen
I lost my mind
Shit, I'mma let it find me this time
I'm sick of the games it got me feelin' insane
But still I rise
So one time for the Vill niggas (Hey!)
It's our time, nigga deal with it (Hey!)
Seen hard times but I'm still winnin'
And I promised I wouldn't change and I still didn't
Village Up!

[Intro]
10-4, 10, 10-4. Hello? We-got- We got a  4-2-3. We got a young man riding around, in a Natty Caddy, hehe
Natty Caddy, not that at all

[Verse 1]
Who's that creepin' through the city in that dark ass tint
Misdemeanor on the way yo
I slide in my rimless Bentley, no tights, I'm gymnast
Bending blocks, my world of Legos
Now baby, hold that wheel while I'm rollin' up
Hopefully she old enough
To purchase that liquor, what I need from the store
She understands her selection, advance her affection
And fears my rejection, never needing a ho
I got plans to be that nigga, I know you met him as a child
He gave you 10 bones, don't sweat it, don't wile'
Be cool for a minute, '93 'Til be cool for Emmett
The hung soul a rapper goes rapping those wrapping woes up
Defying foes, lying toes, weapons on tuck
Malcolm, they tackle for belief in the movement
But Rashad got applause for releasing the music

[Hook]
Now sometimes I be gettin' higher than a bitch
Smoking all my lows, put the fire to the spliff
What up, now what up
Now I've been getting higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
Now what up, now what up, now what up, what up

[Verse 2]
Ay, ay, ay, yeah
Niggas steppin' in the swimming pool, invincible
Women I pursue get lost in this, uh
Middle of the summer's in Miami
Kembe with me, Henney, sippin shots like I bought it for him
I'm a brown skin small waisted
I'm creeping with my ball faces, I like her titties too
I like her attitude, I like her flexible
She got a baby due, I think she bisexual
At least I hope so
I glance to that little grown man at her front door
He looking at me like I looked at pops when he come fo'
My mama as a toddler I was selfish this ain't nothin' though
I can spit a couple 22s if I want to
I save it for the tour, the allure of the gap tooth
Rap Toose in shape or somethin'
Always knew he would make him something
He got schemes to smoke green
And make him some, take em son

[Hook][Intro]
Uhh, can you turn it down a little bit?
Not, not the headphones but the music a little bit?
I mean the music down a little bit, I mean down

I just came in here to say a couple words real quick, you know?
First I got to shoutout the engineer MD, for letting me use his shit, quality shit, forreal
I got to shoutout to my boy Al, you know, and Derek and everybody
I gotta shoutout the chick, this chick [?] and everybody
Everybody from East Lake to Eastdale
Southside to the Westside
North Chatt, East Chatt
Everybody that feel they gonna do something different so if you gonna do something different you might as well do it right
And I feel like that's what I was tryin' to do, so
Internet, that's all I really gotta say
Love yourselves
Be smart
Peace, soul, and happiness peeps
One, like that[Verse 1 Kembe X]
And all I ever wanted was a Lexus
Topless preferably
I'd smoke her out like daily, have some time to encourage me
Break necks when I pull off, niggas too lame
Maybe all them bitches stop and stare just cause the shoe game crazy
23s, 23s
On the whip
When I skrrt off
I can't help but to crack this swisher sweet
Burn hurt off in a zip
Never trip
When they mention me
Somebody snap this picture please
Bad bitch and her friend finna dip with me
And I act like it never meant shit to me

[Julian Malone]
It's on nigga, keys open doors and start the engine
Mercedes and Lexus swag, both yellow just like a lemon
Took a couple test runs, inspect em for good suspension
Both passed with flying colors, drove fast with good precision
Bad bitches wanting me more, jealousy making em go
For me like never before
Kobe, I'm riding on 4s
Who knows, might be one of your hoes
Staring while I ignore
Hopin I let her roll
To flex to foes

[Hook - Isaiah Rashad]
Now this is what you ride for
Golden diamond plated vices
Getcha shine for it
Buy a Lexus, lose your license
Do some time for it
And it's so lonely at the top
But would you die for it?
Would you die for it?

[Verse 2 Julian Malone]
See I'm on nigga, them keys open doors and help em listen
Bitches is patient and act vacant when you wh-wh-whip em
In the lot
Full of hella goofies, hoopties [?]
Freshest thing that she's ever seen in this fucking spot
Evident that I'm pretty arrogant, but I'm elegant
Also discredited, but not for long for definite
Edited for excellence
So pestilence to pessimists
Rollin round, rollin-rollin round
With that Lexus bitch

[Kembe X]
And all I ever wanted was Alexis
Topless preferably
Would gas her up like daily
And it's been awhile since she heard from me
Break necks when I'm with her
Niggas too lame mayne
See she got these bitches hating on her
Cause her shoe game crazy
Double D's, Double D's
On a bitch
I still flirt off
I can't help but to crack a smirk
And ask her homegirl for a kiss
I ain't shit, niggas envy me
Hate that they grant my wishes
Sneak bad bitch from her man and she dip with me
And I act like it never meant shit to me

[Hook - Isaiah Rashad]
Now this is what you ride for
Golden diamond plated vices
Getcha shine for it
Buy a Lexus, lose your license
Do some time for it
And it's so lonely at the top
But would you die for it?
Would you die for it? x3

Ridin' out with my niggas, rollin up them swishers
Ridin' out with my niggas, rollin up them swishers
I'm just Ridin' out with my niggas, rollin up them swishers
I'm posted up with 8 bitches
Way sexier than they pictures x2

[Outro][Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Look into my wallet
Found some change for your life
And maybe a new car or some brain from your wife
You probably never thought of how the sames are alike
And probably never tried to pull the dark from the light
I'm higher than a kite, while i'm riding on a bike
Through Amsterdam fields, with a head full of pills
And half of my face is numb
Pour some Neapolitan on the racist's tongue
This Chevy's a sixty-seven but the race is young
But she gives good brain but her ass is dumb
I have no one to blame, Obama nor Bush
I just need a little hug from a bag full of kush

I just need a little hug from a bag full of kush
That's it

[Verse 2]
Lemme take you back, thinkin' real hard
Way before I started doin' this rap
Just a young boy with a nice dream
Tryin' to get a puff of wheels on this real life thing
Tryin' to make her feel, tryin' to make a mil'
In this rap game but I ain't thinkin' it was real
They ain't takin' me serious but I'm 'bout to let you know
I ain't nothing with these jokes
Nice and smooth like a blunt of kush
But I can go real hard like some [?] kush
Amsterdam lookin' in your system
Got a nigga feelin' like he on swisha[Produced by Chris Calor]

[Verse 1: Rob December]
The no stoner, has a boner, I need head and some sex
Sometimes vulgar, I'm quite Homer, dream 'bout booze and some tits
Speak 'bout bitches less than often cause they lie for the dick
Thus an evil of a creature, who plays games on gent
I sit lonely in my Honda, behind darkest of tint
Smoke a woodtip for my problems and give Brandy a sip
Get confided in the voice, spill my feelings and shit
Breaking codes and regulations, not a pimp nor a simp
Give me things that make me happy, cause the bottom I hit
Fuck a bowl, give me love, fuck your words, give me drugs Promethazine, a nice to meet you, you made bitch niggas all seem to
Misuse the words of trill, hold the gun so they real
'til their face in the reel, watch a real nigga squeal
When the piglets peal, the tabs off of your grill
Yeah you chirping, pleading deals with your faggot ass

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
Been sipping on this, stop telling me, start to get sober
Bill Bellamy, tickle my bellilly, I would do anything just to get over
So I drank sometimes, then I paint these rhymes, pardon me, I'm antsy
Why? My heart quite nervous, '95 I'm swerving, then I hit them curbs
No then boys ain't working, fuck a black Suburban, commissary purchase
My daddy calls, I barely answer, fuck parental curses
I spit too many verses, I know you fucking heard 'em
So why you leave them voicemails that you know gone hurt me
Tired of rapping that real shit, if nobody gone feel this
I could be gripping that steel shit, you too busy to deal with
It's like, they told me all the time "You got the gift of the gab"
Finally niggas is listening, yeah, then I just start with this missing my dad

[Outro: Isaiah Rashad]
Damn, so like when... you gone quit? You trill now, huh?
You cool, huh? You real? You real, that's what's popular, huh?
That's cool, you UGK for life, huh? Boy Stop[Intro]
I was singing my song for nobody

[Verse 1: Kevin Adams]
I'm like a Rolling Stone rolling stone
And I'm the shit playa, but don't flush your commode
And I hope you smell me, but this Polo cologne
Slamming (?) like I got an attitude or something wrong
It's like I'm switching cars the way I them holding on the
Every word I spit like I got a lisp and it is hella strong
Kicks like (?) play this off a house party
And you niggas look gay, like Jesse McCartney
It to be real it wouldn't be logic to fuck with me
Cause we on some Adele shit, we be rolling deep
Your girl get mad when I pass and I don't even speak
Prolly cause I got all up inside and was behind her teeth
I need a piece of at least if I can get the whole cake
Cause I be going all in like a young Drake
Yeah, you probably didn't get that like money
Yeah, you probably didn't get that
Imma keep it real cause some liars don't do that
And Imma blow cause I've seen a fucking fire do that
And Imma take a trick magicians be like how he do that?
And I be killing beats rappers be like why he do that?
Bitches say I'm clean and I don't even try to dress
I could fuck her though but I ain't even tryna sex
I got her number man and I ain't even tryna text
I strong armed dude and I ain't gotta flex
I spit profound shit that I could never lose
And I was better than half these dudes back in middle school
And I remember days like this
Tapping out the whole world with a pen in my wrist
Freestyling in class I bet the teacher was pissed
I probably should've paid more attention, yeah i'm slick
But bitch I probably won't be like this no more
I thunk outside the box and they won't let me back in that ho
Damn..

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah
Lounging with my feet up
Them lame motherfuckers drop their faces when they see us
We could play pretend them niggas still couldn't be us
Back in Chattanooga still couldn't Tennessee us
It's conflict when I'm writing these rhymes
Tryna fit my whole life up in thirty two lines but
I keep it real that's how it happened
The government gonna do me in like Fred Hampton, a black panther
Let's keep it real from the Hamptons
A penny saving, minimum wage is some shit, plantation
Slaves to the modern day, swimming Frank Ocean
Guns waving guns blazing filling in the holster
All I need is some cake like a fuckin' Hostess
At a table can't eat, grab a fuckin' hostess
Put my back against the wall like a fuckin' poster
Put my money on the table like a fuckin' coaster
Who's better? You's better? That's fuckin' bogus
I got your bitch up in my sheets like a fuckin' toga
Positions in some shit, sexual yoga
Master of that pussy, sexual Yoda
Jedi mind tricks watch that nine dip
That's food for thoughts, 9 clips

[Verse 3: Amazn]
Yeah
All I need in this life is a bitch and a blunt
Good head and cooked food is all a nigga want
I don't trust too many niggas so my circle small
Never let 'em hear my feelings only pussy involved
I know it's kinda cold but the fuck is you to judge me
The last time I fell in love man I damn near lost me
So I spit my feelings in these raps to get my feelings back
Cause lately I been feeling lost stranded like I need map
Tired of the bullshit so I need a nap
I'm for hungry for this music shit so I'm eating tracks
Flow hotter than anniversary candle wax
I'm feeling sorry for the competition cause they lack
Originality, imagine they shittin style
I'm looking like a vet and you been at this for awhile
21 years old, nigga no pressure
I cop your bitch with ease dog, I'm talking no effort
Don't be mad at me, bruh, cause she chose greatness
It was long overdue cause you kept her waiting
She fell in love with my poetic flow and way with words
All this time you playing daddy but the kid ain't even yours[Verse]
Late nights, stay on it
Bright lights, they want it
And it's funny how you so charismatic
A sex addict, but stay lonely
Throw a beat on, I kill it
Not a gun though, my feelings
Here comes slow, pop pilling
And I die young, God willing
God willing, shit
Got me over here tripping
And liquor don't help for the feelings I felt
I'm just over here chilling
Yeah, always seem to blame a bitch
The only thing I got is my pain and shit
And these hoes want art
Love over your canvases
Should I talk about my dad or something?
Always feel like I'm mad for nothing
Rap fast cause a crash is coming
And it hurts for the words but it lasts for something
Po Pimpin' so Do or Die
Slit wrists, so suicidal
Stay cool in a pool of fire
Worship in a verse, nigga who's your idol?
Ain't never felt like this before
Would you ride for freedom? Would you die for freedom?
Got a ski mask on and a pistol loaded
Hear money talking, I die to meet 'em
Looking forward to the bright lights
Late nights and the bullshit
Yeah, they was talking that good shit
That's far as they could get, yeah[Intro]
I gotta, um... I been drinking
I feel like making fun of niggas (Bitch)

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Ay, bitch I'm back, nah, I'm just starting
Man them niggas gonna hold you back, you're retarded
Crazy loc told me hold that gat, don't be a target
Quit smoking them blacks, practice performing
Bitch I'm back again, and I'm rolling, see I really mean that shit
She 'bout 5'5" and she rude, man I really queen that bitch
And ain't did shit, and ain't paid
I ain't tryna seem that rich
Can I get a discount on these Lays?
Is he 'bout to kill this rhyme where you stay?
So how you different? How you unique?
Who you tempting? Where's your mystique?
I just ride around in my Bentley, it's a Civic
See the women love when I'm honest, they said it's different
I don't get how all these rappers be so successful
They tell you lies, and nothing helpful
But you claim you feel it, yeah that's your man though
You stand for him, but what he stand for?

[Hook]
I'm just riding 'round getting paid
Fucking bitches, getting paid, gusto

[Verse 2: Brian Cameron]
Hey, bitch I'm back, like where the fuck I started?
These niggas thinking they the shit, but they ain't even really farted
Really thinking that a nigga on blaze, I ain't even tryna spark it
Your chick be all on my cock and balls, now tell your bitch quit gargling
I promise I'm authentic, straight genuine
I working out, shit I'm in the same gym you in
So he got a big deal? Big deal
So what he spit some shit that ain't real?
Get lit and write some shit you can't feel
So you can get expensive shit and switch heels
Goddamn, that's a problem, y'all fucking up my genre
See me? I'm a pro-masturbater
Nigga I be killing and spitting it when I rap
Yearn for the cat, he be earning the map
Got a hole in her teeth, put my sperm in her gap
Camerino on the job
Why these niggas so wack, let me ask Rashad
Let me ask a motherfucker like you
Who speak weak shit, cause the clique said "Cool"
They say "Bro you the shit, man the world gonna be bumping this
When you get real big and put us on, are we all gonna be rich?"
Get off my dick nigga, we ain't friends
Just another bitch with another loose end
See you at the top, and until then
Just choke on my pubes and swallow my kids

[Verse 1]
Now, everybody tellin' me a lie
Lordy, give me something for my soul
See, I don't wanna think of suicide
So please don't take the lock key off my door
See, I've been tired of fucking all these girls
And I've been tired of spending all my dough
And if I give my story to the world
I wonder if they'd book me for a show
See you can't handle pressure on your own
So why you carry boulder by yourself?
The story’s storyteller tell it wrong
And glorify the horror and the wealth
And Mama call me, tell me coming home
And I just need some guidance in my steps
I know I'm not the only one alone
I know I'm not the only one who felt

[Hook: SZA]
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm praying that I make it twenty-five
They be calling doctors for my health
And "no" is kinda hard to say to drugs
Cause I been having problems with myself
And I been asking questions, where the love?
And they don't give me answers, just a check
And they don't know my issues as a child
Cause I was busy cutting on myself
And hanging from the playground wasn't wrong
Until you got a rope around your neck
And I been losing more than just my mind
Gathering what's left of self-respect
And Daddy, why you call me while you're drunk?
And why you never love me when I need it?
And I don't wanna be like you no more
And I been trying to cope, I'm getting weeded

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I smoke too much: The problems of a twenty-something
I drink too often, there's liquor pouring from the faucet
You would assume by following the tunes
That I'm doomed to die young, addicted to dry plum
These bitches ain't shit, and pussy is my greatest vice
I love smoking weed, I hate advice
I know some niggas that talk good
The wise men from a long line of bitch-made and brides-men
You never had nothing but fucking dreams
You just caught up in the hype
The fashion and so it seems, the limelight
I know that I rhyme tight
No need for your two cents and burning your blueprints
These people think I really give a fuck about the shit they give a fuck about
Just need a moment of silence, just close your fuckin' mouth
Infatuated with violence, gun in my fuckin' mouth
So you don't even know that I'm serious, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Like you got punchlines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
And you got punch lines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
Yeah, and I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
And they souls was never in it, like
And I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
They souls was never in it, like...[Produced by Ross Vega]

[Hook]
I ain't eatin' in the morn' I be sippin' on the Henny, Henny
You been lookin' for the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
Ain't thinkin' bout your love I be shittin' on your feelings, feelings
And you be lovin' on the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one

[Verse 1]
My daddy taught me how to drink my pain away
My daddy taught me how to leave somebody
My daddy taught me how to smoke my load and go
My daddy taught me you don't need nobody
So one time for the caged bird
And one time for the real niggas
And slow dance on the Jäger
And one time for the little niggas

[Hook]
