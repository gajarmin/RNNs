[Verse 1]
Welcome, yeah it's been a long minute
Let me break it down now if ya'll still with it
First time I did it, yeah I'll admit it
I kinda hit it and quit it and left ya'll hanging
Sang it, kinda off key with a passion
Asking, can I give you back that action?
Yeah I'ma blast in a hashtag fashion
To spell it out for you like a mass closed caption
Get a closed casket, fade to black
This is my spot that I'm taking back
Get at me punk I was made for that
Ya'll don't really even know what you aiming at
So far back what you waving at?
Ya'll can't see the stage that I'm playing at
Ya'll hating that but that's why I do it
So tell me where the motherfucking haters at?
Cause

[Chorus]
I don't need their blessing now
I don't need their invitation
Ain't no way to shut me down
Or to take this path I've taken
And maybe I've been left out
Never let this be mistaken
They can keep that blessing now, forget me now
Cause I was never welcome

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's been a long road
Never really know how it all unfold
I'm just trying hard not to sell my soul
When the rest want guns and a mouth full of gold
I don't hate 'em, I still love 'em
That's not me, I'm not judging
Not below 'em, not above 'em
But disrespect me? Well then fuck 'em
This a house I'm living in
Ya'll just pass through visiting
I draw these lines ya'll fill 'em in
I'm a grown ass man, y'all children
No competition, I'm killing them
Talking 'bout him and him and him
Let's take it out for another spin again
And I don't give a fuck if I win again
Cause

[Chorus]
I don't need their blessing now
I don't need their invitation
Ain't no way to shut me down
Or to take this path I've taken
And maybe I've been left out
Never let this be mistaken
They can keep that blessing now, forget me now
Cause I was never welcome

[Interlude/Bridge]
No (I was never welcome)
No
No
No, no, no (I was never welcome)
No
No (I was never welcome)
No, no

[Chorus]
I don't need their blessing now
I don't need their invitation
Ain't no way to shut me down
Or to take this path I've taken
And maybe I've been left out
Never let this be mistaken
They can keep that blessing now, forget me now
Cause I was never welcome

[Outro]
I was never welcome (No)
I was never welcome (No, no)
I was never welcome
I was never welcome (No)[Hook]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Mike
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Makin' a story, makin' sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin it up, let's go

[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' 'em star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin' raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin' for someone's help, to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill
Eighty percent fear
Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, "Name Of The Game"
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach man, why you have the stupidest verse?
This dude is the truth, now everybody givi'n him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu The Sick
And he's spittin' fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
Been a fuckin' nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin', patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep askin' him, "Was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?"
No, he's livin' proof, got him rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doin', give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike
Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

[Hook x2][Hook: Skylar Grey]
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said "Some days I feel like shit
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long
And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone
Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up I don't have much to say
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
You know the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Hallowe'en with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way
You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For while you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

[Hook]

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
When you made me that initial batch of songs, I was like, that's the shit right there
Holla![Intro: Mike's father]
"My father, came from Japan, in 1905
He was fifteen when he, immigrated from Japan
He, he, he worked until he was able to buy
To actually build a store"

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Let me tell you a story in the form of a dream
I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means
Close your eyes, just picture the scene
As I paint it for you; it was World War II
When this man named Kenji woke up
Ken was not a soldier, he was just a man
With a family who owned a store in L.A
That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids
He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran
He moved to L.A. from Japan
They called him immigrant, in Japanese
He'd say he was called "iisei"
That meant first generation
In the United States when
Everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs
But most of all afraid of a homeland attack
And that morning, when Ken went out on the doormat
His world went black, cause
Right there, front page news
Three weeks before 1942
Pearl Harbor's been bombed and "The Japs are Coming"
Pictures of soldiers dyin and runnin
Ken knew what it would lead to
And just like he guessed, the president said
"The evil Japanese in our home country would be locked away"
They gave Ken,a couple of days
To get his whole life packed in two bags
Just two bags, he couldn't even pack his clothes
And some folks didn't even have a suitcase
To pack anything in
So two trash bags, is all they gave them
And when the kids asked mom, "Where are we goin?"
Nobody even knew what to say to them
Ken didn't wanna lie
He said, "The U.S. is lookin for spies
So we have to live in a place called Manzanar
Where a lot of Japanese people are"
Stop it, don't look at the gunmen
You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin
If you're gonna run or not
Cause if you run then you might get shot
Other than that, try not to think about it
Try not to worry 'bout it bein so crowded
Cause someday we'll get out, someday, someday

[Sample: Mike's aunt]
"Yeah, soon as war broke out the FBI came and
They just come through the house and, you have to come
All the Japanese have to go
They took Mr. Ni, the people couldn't understand
Why they had to take him because he's an innocent laborer."

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin them
Every day every night, looked down at them
From watchtowers up on the wall
Ken couldn't really hate them at all
They were just doin their job and
He wasn't gonna make any problems
He had a little garden
Vegetables and fruits that he gave to the troops
In a basket his wife made
But in the back of his mind he wanted his family's life saved
Prisoners of war in their own damn country - what for?
And time passed in the prison town
He wondered if he'd live it down
If and when they were free
The only way out was joinin the Army, and supposedly
Some men went out for the army, signed on
And ended up flyin to Japan with a bomb
That 15 kiloton blast
Put an end to the war pretty fast
Two cities were blown to bits
The end of the war came quick
And Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life
With his kids and his wife, but
Then they got back to the home and
What they saw made him feel so alone
These people had trashed every room
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
Written on the walls and the floor
"Japs not welcome anymore!"
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides
And just stood outside
He - looked at his wife without words to say
She looked back at him wipin tears away
And, said someday we'll be okay, someday
Now the names have been changed but the story is true
My family was locked up back in '42
My family was there where it was dark and damp
And they called it an internment camp

[Outro: Mike's aunt]
"When we first got back from camp, uhh it was, pretty, pretty bad."
"I-I remember, my husband said, 'Ohh we're gonna stay 'til last.'
Then my husband died, before they closed the camp."[Hook]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

[Ryu]
I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like funny games, keep playing'em
I'm just saying, think back then, you was like one of the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train
Just like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
And in your brain like a maze you can never escape the rain
Every damn day is the same shade of grey

[Mike]
Hey, I use to have a little bit of plan
Use to have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right out of my hand
Now I don't really even know who I am
Yo, what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen with me

[Hook]

[Mike]
Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually
Now I'll be thinking like the mistake I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work cause it's really much worse
Then I thought, I wished you were something you were not
And now this guilt is really all that I got

[Tak]
You turn your back and walk away in shame
All you got is a memory of pain
Nothing makes sense and you stare at the ground
And hear my voice in your head when no one else is around
So what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen to me

[Hook] x2

I'll do what I have to do
(You're on your own now believe me)
Whatever happens to you
(You're on your own now believe me)
What do I have to say
(You're on your own now believe me)
Is not gonna happen to me
(You're on your own now believe me)[Mike Shinoda]
Someone right now is leaving their apartment
Looking down at the street, and wondering where their car went
Someone in the car sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant, staring through the window
At someone right now with their finger in their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
Spent half the rent, at a bar getting plastered
Now he's gotta walk, 14 blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone right now is looking pretty tired
Staring at a laptop trying to get inspired
Somebody living right across the street
She wrote the best things she's written all week
But her best friend's coughing up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
That he knows it looks bad, but there's nothing he can do
I wonder what's it like being right there in his shoes
But..

[Hook] 1x (Mike Shinoda)
Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom again
Tomorrow I will be gone
I don't know when I will be back
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

[Ryu]
Somebody right now is droppin' his vote
Inside a box, and trying not to get shot in his throat
For the act of freedom
Right now somebody stuck in Iraq, hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war where he's not really sure of the reasons
So we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud and salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

[Tak]
Meanwhile, right now someone's 25 to life
And standing on the corner with their thumb up hitch hike
And scratching of a lotto ticket, hoping for a real winner
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now, someone wishes they were you and I
Instead of second guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now, staring out the window at a fiend
With holes in his arms, and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette, and sparked a light
And walked right around the corner, just out of my sight, but..

[Hook] 2x (Ryu & Tak)
Yo, I'm just taking it in
From a second story hotel window again
TV's on, and my bags are packed
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

[Black Thought]
Right now, somebody is sitting in the darkness
Trying to figure out how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, a little carpet
And they appreciate it cause some people on a park bench
You see them when you rushing to get to the office
Wife fly by when she coming home from the market
Right now somebody's coming out the pocket
Trying to dump that rock, they run around the block with
Same time the cops is raising their Glocks
With aim to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now somebody is struggling to stop this man
Who's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall, the child taking his first breath
The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yeah, yo, I wonder if he understand what it's worth yet
Like time spent, while we're on the earth yea
The answer to the question we all seek
Can be found, it depends on how free ya'll think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is the next man's treasure
One man's pain is the next man's pleasure
One say infinity, the next say forever
Right now everybody gotta get it together, man

[Hook] (Black Thought)
Uh, I'm just taking it in
In an another strange hotel lobby again
Put my luggage on my back, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in the world where it all changes just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

Yeah, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel, better again
Tomorrow I will be gone
I don't know when I will be back
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that[Verse 1 - Mike Shinoda]
Let's go ya'll

These people are running off at the mouth
Tryin to convince me that I'm running on empty
Tryin to convince themselves that the record
With Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm makin is a mistake
And I can't take this
Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playin'
Start askin me the names that I'm not sayin'
But I'm tryin to be bigger than the bickerin'
Bigger than the petty name callin'
Under the breath talkin
Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor
No patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talkin' while I'm walkin away

[Hook - John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
Cause my mind's made up anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say what you have to say
Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work today

[Verse 2 - Mike Shinoda]
You people are running off at the mouth
Tryin to make me take myself off safety
Tryin to make my friends turn their backs on the team we built
Buildin' up some mistaken information
And I can't take this
Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complain about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintainin my name, the same way I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playin'
Start asking the names that I'm not sayin'
But I'm tryin not to mention the names of people
Who wanna sight and attention
You like the hype but pretendin you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout
No class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talkin' while I'm walkin away
Bitch

[Hook]

[Bridge - John Legend]
Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to breathe (breathe, breathe)

Is anybody out there listening?
Cause I can't stand to keep this in
All I really want, I'll say it again (yeah, yeah)
(Like that)

[Hook][Mike Shinoda]
Yo, you ready do this? ( do that, do that, do that !) Ok
Come on! Let's go!

[Green Lantern]
This is an invasion
Evil genius Green Lantern
Mike Shinoda

[Mike Shinoda]
Ladies and gentlemen
I would like to welcome you to a Fort Minor event
The countdown has begun
The Rising Tied is almost here
But for now...

[Green Lantern]
Come on, Mike! Come on, Mike !

[Mike Shinoda]
Yo, let's get it going in front of every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of saying sorry
This is the way we rock steady over everybody #screeching noise#
Yo, let's get it going in front of every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of saying sorry
You probably shocked, probably ready to stop this already
You probably can't hang with the way we attack it so steady
We let it rock the Rover, bang the Benz, shake the Chevy
'Til everybody feels it in the chest, say it with me

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Mike Shinoda]
Wait a second, you know the program, this is not a slow jam
This is not a love song, unless you love tearing shit down
Take a look around, you're not running this
The bluff in your nothing will hit you like a ton of bricks
Hit you together with pressure you can never stand
The softest leather just a featherweight, never man
We're not your competitors setting you straight
You never compete, forget it, it's already too late, go!

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Yo, if you don't see, I'm a make you see this
If you don't roll, I'm a make you believe it
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Green Lantern]
Shh, give me a second, I'm collecting my thoughts
And setting plots

[Mike Shinoda]
All right y'all ready or not?!
I've listened and watched and waited for an opening spot
And now that I got it, nobody can pay me to stop
I'm sick of that same thing I've been forced to hear
Over and over again, let me make this clear
If anybody pretends that we're nothing to fear
I solemnly swear it's over, you can tell 'em we're here

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Yo, if you don't see, I'm a make you see this
If you don't roll, I'm a make you believe it
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

Everybody owes, everybody pays
Because...[Apathy]
I'll break ya brain cells off at the stem your status is stupider
Ap' is a nuclear blast, heart blacker than Lucifer
I could sit and write a list of all the shit I would do to ya
Head so big, I rest my fitted cap on Jupiter
You ain't built like this, you a soft carbon copy
A care bear compared to a auto-box rotty
For raps like crack I supply to the blacks
Drop pipes, cop mics, say good-bye to your rocks
I'm a motherfuckin star, the status of John Lennon
Y'all are ordinary people, singin' to John Legend
Write a track dissin' Ap'? Better X that out
I don't play that, like rap in a redneck's house
I could have ya brain cells spinnin quicker than Sprewell's
Ya female e-mailing me all ya details
I don't dig up dirt, I shake the Earth
And I never say names, I wouldn't waste a verse
Off of the top I'm hot, and when they dare me to write
Prepare to carry a mic to a burial site
I'm a pioneer fuckin' up stereotypes
I snatch chains as a kid, made you carry ya bikes
I got an addiction to spitting shit is heroin-like
Story teller speak of hell and the American plight
Money blower, funny though it seems embarrassin' right?
Rock shows, blow the do' on a pair of Air Nike's
All Night!

[Tak]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yo
You know the rules, I cruise with a tough band
You in the fuckin closet with brooms and a dustpan
I clean sweep ya fleet, body softer than gelatin
Now you on the mic, yeah right my life in ya skeleton dummy
I'm in the place, you can tell when it's bloody
I freakin', pay for ya face grade and mail you the money
I'm ready I'm willin' to watch, spy on seven that flinch
Let's see if I don't kill 'em in five seconds or less
I keep comin' back like rashes on an infant
You don't wanna chance to clash with the magnificent
Seven of us, it's heaven but never enough
So I tighten the vice grip, so his head'll get crushed
Look, I'm out of sight now, deep in this music
Leavin' 'em upside-down, fiendin for new shit
Ribkat it's the roll power creep in the booth quick
Blow a hole in ya back, just to eat off a soup dish
You bitch

[Celph Titled]
Yo!
The Demigod stands for killa's
More specifically we Deadly Entertainers Maniac Ignorant GODzilla's
And we, never took the route them other crooks took
Cuz we kept recipes for human flesh in my mother's cookbook
Get souffled in more ways then ten
Celph Titled flow is chokin' the wind, my favorite pastime's soakin' in sin
The most accurate sharpshooter with no scope
Shoot with my left and watch you all die from secondhand smoke
I'm reppin' my fam SO, You better act cool
My soul will make a Ouija Board jump up and slap you dummy
You not thinkin' smart
I bust so many blamma's and blicka's that I should start a rock band called
"Blink & Spark"
Sinkin' sharks with no harpoons, my arsenal
Is sawblade carbon tools slidin' ya coffin through
Apathy's insane and I'm the same as my brother
I'm like a circus show sniper, I aim for the juggler
Catch a case and before the judge can slam down the gavel
The whole room duck and hide from grenade shrapnel
These rap verses I be breezin' through
Cuz I'm like a celebate, under oath, Un-Fuckin-Believable

(behind turntable scratchin) x2
Demigods, Fort Minor
"Ya Ya heard of us"
Styles of Beyond
"Ya Ya heard of us, the murderous"[Common]
Uhh, yeah, yo
We 'bout to take y'all to the tip, to the crib
Let's do it Mike (yeah)

[Hook: Mike Shinoda]
Back home (back home) everybody's searching for something
But all they can find's a whole lot of nothing
Back home (back home) ain't nobody hopin and prayin
Cause they feel like nothin can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact
That life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
Cause ain't a damn thing free back home (back home)

[Common]
Back home, they holla "disciple" and "blackstone"
Same block they freebase, yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched, the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it, in many ways this city raised me
And gave me the drama, honor and bravery
The streets seem hollow, when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow, times is hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow, I borrow
Words from the Bible, and use them for survival
Gangs rival, signs painted on walls like hiero-glyphics
I tell them that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt, shorty's goin through the same cycle
And trials like Michael, tryin not to stay idle - back home

[Hook]

[Ryu]
Back home, it's not Compton but close, the same problems exist
And the pain throbbin and folks are so common
It don't, really bother us much, we just swallow it
Uh, crack the bottle and smoke
Hope tomorrow somethin magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home, we get the good life at a glimpse
In the form of a rap star, drug dealers and pimps
I'm back, home

[Tak]
Back, home - I try my best to keep it together
It's cold, like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth, lookin for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source, need somethin to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life, only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight, bringin truth back to the game

[Mike Shinoda]
Back, home - we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on somethin cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop, bottom line, doin what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people callin us hopeless
People tryin to tell us all we need is some focus
But, focus, focus is overrated
Cause you see every blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado, K-Town and J-Town
Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver, livin right in the litter
Where kids write bigger, right inside the L.A. river
On the concrete, a symbol of our everyday way
It's that color and concentration over heavy and gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay (yeah)

[Hook]

[Outro: Common]
We takin it back home y'all
Yeah, it's Common Sense (yeah)
My guy Mike (what up Com'?)
S.O.B. (uh-huh) yeah
This time we rotate, it's good music (ha ha ha)
Hip-Hop (it don't stop) yeah, uhh
It's home for me baby, yeah[Hook]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

[Ryu]
I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like funny games, keep playing'em
I'm just saying, think back then, you was like one of the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train
Just like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
And in your brain like a maze you can never escape the rain
Every damn day is the same shade of grey

[Mike]
Hey, I use to have a little bit of plan
Use to have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right out of my hand
Now I don't really even know who I am
Yo, what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen with me

[Hook]

[Mike]
Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually
Now I'll be thinking like the mistake I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work cause it's really much worse
Then I thought, I wished you were something you were not
And now this guilt is really all that I got

[Tak]
You turn your back and walk away in shame
All you got is a memory of pain
Nothing makes sense and you stare at the ground
And hear my voice in your head when no one else is around
So what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen to me

[Hook] x2

I'll do what I have to do
(You're on your own now believe me)
Whatever happens to you
(You're on your own now believe me)
What do I have to say
(You're on your own now believe me)
Is not gonna happen to me
(You're on your own now believe me)[Intro: Lupe (with Holly Brook and Tak of Style of Beyond)]
Uh!
MS, Lupe
You know I'm a fan man, I'm a real fan
(Gonna be somebody)
Feel real honoured to be up in here
(Gonna be someone)
You know what I'm sayin'
They had to bring out the expensive mics for this one
(Gonna be somebody)
You know what I'm sayin'
The....seven thousand dollar headphones for this one here
(Gonna be someone)
Know what I'm sayin'?
Come on
Talk to me!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is the story of them against us
Win or lose
Forcing your feet into someone else's shoes
Everybody's got something to say
That we ought to live their way
What we're doing's not okay
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of their neck
Got no respect, wait up a sec
You ever feel like the pressure's too much too take
Too much weight
Ladies, and, gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now
Please shout back
We're not the only ones feeling so trapped
In a dream of somebody else, in fact
They got their heads full of some overblown scheme
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

[Hook: Holly Brook and Tak of Styles of Beyond (Shinoda)]
Gonna be somebody
(For anybody telling me I can't)
Gonna be someone
(For anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody
(I'm telling you the time has come)
Gonna be someone
(And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)

[Verse 2: Shinoda]
We don't sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
Cause this ride is about to begin
Sit down, and buckle it in
Let me say it again
In this world
Everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck
Got no respect, wait up a sec
When I was young
They said the odds of making it were slim, to none
Ladies, and, fuck it
I'm tired of them saying the dream you have doesn't exist
Telling you you're worthless, saying you should quit
Basically telling you that you'll never be shit
Really they're pissed cause they'll never achieve
Some opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh
They gon' think you're crazy mumbling to yourself
In the basement all day uh-uh-uhin to yourself
My pops didn't dig it, was shoveling to myself
My boys used to get it, they dug it because they felt
My undertaking took me, I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy, I would chuckle to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex
See I'm know 'em by heart, like a brain in my chest
Then I took them to school where subjects was gettin' felt
Books under my seat, notebook laying on my desk
My teacher's like, "Mr. Jaco?" "Yes?"
"With all that knowledge, you ain't trynna go to college?
Be a lawyer or a doctor, get a whole lot of dollars?
Rather degrade women and glorify violence?"
"Well the work that works for me might not work for you
No homework, I got work to do."

[Hook]

[Outro: Mike]
And I'm finally done!
Yeah
This one goes out to those fantastic human beings that keep us down and hold us back
And give us fuel for what we do
Thanks[Green Lantern:]
...invasion!

[Mike:]
Hey Ap, why don’t you do the uh…the intro on this shit?
[Apathy:]
Yo Apathy, Fort Minor, Styles Of Beyond, Demigodz

[Mike:]
Here we go

[Verse 1 Apathy:]
Yo, rappers like heavy metal and ghettos
Guns, metals and ammos
I pistol whip Tony and fuck Meadow Soprano
A cat who sells them bugs but tell them thugs
They don’t know to carry more heat than welding gloves
I walk amongst the gods, keep my head in the clouds
Oh we show groupie love, getting head in the crowds
Put it in girls mouth blast off like NASA
The master of nastiness transform a classy bitch into
A little sheen freak sadomasochist
Dastardly bastard of rap so disastrous
Spitting, healed a cripple like Christ the miraculous
And fights my savageness, turns punks, pacifists
The police clock Ap like there he go
Always on the watch because I use to carry blow
Always lock her down but I never marry hoes
Bury foes when the flows comes through your stereo

[Verse 2 Mike:]
There we go flipping up a predictable verse
It’s a curse to burst words like Turrets on purpose
Put the verb like a backhand reject perverse as it is
I can't stop and its making me nervous, ok?
Get me on a track and I'm cracking
Packing up a backpack full of tracks on some CDs
Be me, fuck that not like me
To bite me you need to be you times ninety
I got schemes and a team so hyped we
Get on a scene make a scene on the nightly
Say what I mean, whether mean or politely
Living the dream in some clean white Nike's
Or DC's, I'm not giving a shit
Fuck the words that you heard and the lips that they hang from
I stay banging to bang, bang drums and hanging you lames
And the same no names gangs you came from
I don’t got an excuse, just talking the truth
I'm fucking awesome when I'm rocking the booth
And I stay ready with hot bloc rocking abuse
Y'all are really not stopping us dude, yeah Tak, get em'

[Verse 3 Tak:]
It started off get on over and hit the galaxy
Now we're moving them over they're crowing me as the Cali king
Anything tossed on my fuse getting chewed up
With a quota six and little good weight, too much
Going to get smacked in the face with aluminum bats
Your fucking raps as good as me, Boo-booin'
I said I was rude, step in the shoes, you don't believe me
You can ask Devin the dude how I strip down the bitch clown stand in my socks
Whip the mother fuckers ass like I'm Cannibal Ox
You want to be stoned? beat him with a basket of rocks
Get your shit flowing feeling for the casket to drop
You know them S.O.B.'s never get the record to stop
Breaking the habit is impossible what happened to Tak
He's unleashed, he's a beast so Sledge hand me a bloc
Party, whats your corpses posing for, the camera was shot, huh
Styles and Machine Shop, necklace fly
No wonder everyone is so petrified
I said, Styles and Machine Shop, necklace fly
No wonder everyone is so petrified
You hear that?Yeah, go ahead and uh cue the special effects (laugh)

Man I love this rap game, mainly cause it's cool
To add a little spice to the life you've been through
Everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
Make that shit sound more gangsta then it really is
You can't appear weak man, we wanna hear street
We wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
Don't take it as sarcastic, I can't get enough
I'm telling you, you can call my bluff
If it's not rough, Then I really don't need it
I'm not even ashamed; I got too much reality that's filling up my brain
So sell me on that product, I'm addicted to the game
Suck it up like a cigarette, light it up man

[Hook]
It's just like a cigarette it's something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)

Let me tell you something that I realized tonight
My hip-hop radio'ss like Marlboro light
They both telling stories and they sound about the same
Cigarettes say they safe, rappers claim they really bang
We don't care if it's true when we just lay the money down
We don't believe the words, we just love the way they sound
They're acting like we're idiots they're lying to our face
Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway
I'm running out to get the next rappers CD
Just sucking up the guns, drugs and misogyny
The same way that I suck up all the stories when I breathe
That little bit of death supposedly cancer free
And everything they say's got the truth twisted up
And twisted up's what I want man, I can't get enough
Cause even though we know it's all just a big bluff
We just light another up, what we don't give a fuck!!!

[Hook]
(It's just like a cigarette something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)
It's just like a cigarette something that I do
Over and over but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)

Man listen to my words, listen for a while
Lip service radio don't touch the dial
If you're in the car turn up the track man
Give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap, hey
Matter of fact man, listen for a while
Lip service radio don't touch the dial
If your in the car man turn up the track man give your whole
Neighborhood some second hand rap

[Hook][Intro: Mike]
Yeah, like that Y'all
Uh huh, whoo, like that
Fort Minor, S.O.B
Yeah, like this, listen

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Attention please, I only need a second
To make a mental impression directly on any record so
Give me space to move, room to prove I'm stupid with the P's and Q's
Ladies and gentlemen I'm sending you bending
Pretending the pen is a needle, I'm injecting the venom
And I'll be damned if I let another man get to me
I'll bruise you with a shoe to the family jewelry
I'm back with fury, attack quickly
Sick with a BIC pen, all up in your shit man
You never knew the flow was sick as this
Bitch, listen when I'm letting you know
Got a grip on these tracks that you wish you got
Got a clique full of assholes, I kid you not
So when that mixtape's done and that album drops
Ryu and Tak and me got it loaded and locked, believe it

[Verse 2: Ryu]
You still breathing? I'm cocking and squeezing
Tucked still? Nope, I don't give a fuck who sees it
Broad days sitting sideways, stuffed in a small cave
For three fucking weeks 'til you reek like dog waste
Ugh, really, I put a punk in his place
Let's see if he freestyles with a pump in his face
Got something to say? Please, better keep it a secret
The streets got hideous ways of handling beef, bitch
So eat shit, hate it or love it, the underdogs on top
Getting faded telling people to suck it
Bucking 'em down for real while you fucking around
I'm stuck in the house for months tryin to sharpen my skills
So how does it feel? You lames want to claim my throne
You got a better chance getting Danny Hayes on the phone
Good luck, I flame suckers 'til they're black and crispy
Sneaking heat up in the club like a flask of whisky

[Verse 3: Tak]
Yeah, I'm here to crack the roof in
You got a nice watch but your raps are useless
You better cut the crap 'fore I snap some nooses
And leave you all snoozing' on some afternoon shit
I hit the streets with a cake and batter for fun
Just to spit bleach in his face
It's lunchtime punk, open the face
Hit you with a punchline 'til you choke on your teeth
Catch me at the show rockin' in that tipsy mode
Like Angels and Demons unlocking DaVinci's Code
One drop in the cannister, people split the globe
Blowing every planet to shit once I hit the road
You in the tight bitch, cut you with apathy
I'm on the night shift see I hustle like cassidy
So kick that shit sound and let the west coast see
One of the illest names, Ribkat from S.O.B

[Outro: Green Lantern]
That's right, Fort Minor
We Major, Mike Shinoda, S.O.B
Heavy Guard, Machine Shop, Linkin Park
You know, man, this is an...If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

Yo, I don't care if you're a woman or a child or man
When I'm done everybody's gonna understand
Some rappers get mad when you say they're in a band
But, not me
Cause I really am
It's LP for your fucking information pal
So you can stop staring back over your shoulder now
You can't stop me mugging with that twisted brow
Concentrating on mine
You're wasting your time buddy
Erase that face
Replace the frown
Look at the ground
Look down
Quit fucking around
Now jeez, everyone's been so tightly wound
From the minute that we became the new menace in town
Could it be that these cool, contagious
Phrases sprayed aimless
Are making ya'll hate us?
Shit, you can hate 'til your face turns blue
Everyone else
Let me cut up a question for you

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

Oh, there goes another one
Better call all your people in
Bury the body quick stupid
Show you where I’m coming from
Open up the cellar
To the pelican's bliss
With delicatessenal sitting 'til your skeleton splits
He sets us off now
Don’t know which direction is which
We all fell
Little weapons with consecutive hits
But that’ll be that
So never mind your battery pack
Cause in reality nobody gives a crappity-crap
Move over, before you get your flattery snatched
You tiny caterpillars act like you don’t have any sex
Hopping over the gums drilling holes in cavity caps
They’re full of shit to the root now
Pass me that Jack
On the rocks is Tak
Back on the block what?
Tapping your vest like I just happen to pop up
Trapped in a circle
And now he’s itching to box
But no way I’m ‘a stop
Until I’m waiting your snot pus

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

I just say what I feel I don’t care if I’m black balled
Walk up in the label start waving a hack-saw
Hit the bathroom strip naked and jack-off
This white boy’s getting more gangster than Mac Mall
I’m in the crowd I’m feeding your fans roofies
Nope, that ain't a coke it’s a Vicodin smoothie
Yeah, acting boozy a thug like fuck it
Got a champagne taste with a bud light budget
Got a little-ass dick with some [something backwards] on it
So sick I could make a fucking maggot vomit
No Shit
Get the mic’s out
Kick it in gear
It’s Ludacris
All I needed was some chicken and beer
You better, roll out while the coast is clear
We've been hit with thick bottles and a broken chair
Bitch please you can leave with a couple of cracked teeth
Don’t pump me for the fame
I ain't crapped for six weeks / so

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back / I'll
Tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine[Hook 2X - Mike Shinoda]
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

Verse 1 - Mike Shinoda
Standing on a bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my Grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time
I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking laying in that box people look so still
At times like these you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud
I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defence from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme
And get away from the grey just a bit at a time

[Verse 2 - Ryu]
Yeah
Kind of funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing out of cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones
My life's like trying to swallow a pine cone
It's tough when you live fast just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems, so I sleep underneath this park bench
I know it don't make sense, and I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my site, push rocks in the pipe
Lift off, I keep puffing 'til my lips turn white, And my chest gets tight
But who the fuck really cares, when you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday

[Hook 2X - Mike Shinoda]

[Verse 3 - Takbir]
Yo
Pardon me, I think I'm next to earl
Too many problems going on, that's why I left my girl
Pack my backs and I travel with a pen and my notepad
They said I was broke and things that I don't have
But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, See I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but now I'm awake in the storm
Written my life in the short film, the rise and the fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the wall
Pound pavement, Aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing, I'm going the distance
Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
To put it all behind me cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger and know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over again

[Mike Shinoda]
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry
Trying to get by and trying not to feel outta control
And if you look hard enough, sometimes you'll find
A place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, You can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone (so alone, so alone...)

(Scratching...)
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home[Intro: Tak]
Yeah, Ryu and Tak
Yeah, Ryu and Tak (S.O.B.)
Yeah, Ryu and Tak, Demigodz
Green Lantern, Scoop DeVille
This kid is only 17, man
He's about to be a problem

[Hook]
So let's get right to it and groove
It ain't nothin but a thing to get ya people to move
Gotta lovin the way we swing when we step on the scene
You know we kill it, goin all out, we about to {"G-g-g-g-g-get it!"}

[Ryu]
Yo, it's in my blood, I was born to spit it
The coroner has kept me warm through the storms of winter
Ignored the pain and struggle when it's time for dinner
We huddle together and grind, rain or shine
Survive the weather, forget about changin spinners
Throw me a bone, I'm just tryin to raise my litter
It made me bitter, eventually made me sicker
So when the heat's on we don't get pre-game jitters, uh-uh
We go to work man, diggin in dirt
We took 'em to church, we're checkin in some teenage strippers
Livin life by the seat of my pants and three-peated
We champs, undefeated we can't, lose ever
Whoever want it with us better roll with a camp
You trust to cover your ass when your asses can't
Huh, so bottom's up, here's one for the crew
Put some liquor in your gut and tell me what you wanna do, sing it

[Interlude: Ryu (Tak)]
S - for every sucker left behind
O - what they were yellin when I bust a rhyme
B - best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it, no!
(S - for the drunk sexy women)
(O - sippin Jack with some Pepsi in it)
B - best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it, no!

[Hook]

[Tak]
Wow, look at 'em now, their mouths are closed
We done came a long way since 2004
Spilled "Bleach" got the whole entire crowd exposed
The fumes leakin in the street, throwin down them 'bows, whoa
We on the job, the run with the mob
The fake fa?ades to get it just to make new large
I roll a, seven to nine just to break the yards
And step in your mind and unfold the great bizarre
Hit the kill switch, yeah, found my hitch
I'm on the pitcher's mound for now, it's me and Will Smith
Finally overseas, I sneak in the mattress
Ain't nothin like a sweet club freak with an accent
We out gettin bent makin dollar amounts
So if you with me let me see you raise your bottomless shots, say it

[Interlude]

[Hook]

[Holly Brook (Mike Shinoda)]
Gonna be somebody (for anybody tellin me I can't)
Gonna be someone (for anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody (I'm tellin you the time has come - like that)
Gonna be someone (and maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
The dude, he said that, like
When we were making the first Linkin Park record
He was like:
"Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like, I don't know...
Maybe you should just be a rock band."
You know what I mean, like, trying to change us
Like they signed us as an act like what we sound like
And then he's like:
"Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard"

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Before the first song that you heard me on
There were people already tryin' to get me gone
Tellin' me to quit rapping
"Just play the keys"
That my band had a singer
They didn't need me
But my band had my back
So we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first but then the humour faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were to be good to be true
Some were saying ghost writers were writin' all that we do
So we had to disprove it
We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music
After that I made it a rule
I only do e-mail responses to print interviews
Because these people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said something fucking absurd
Oh, did I lose you at infer?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words?
People used to infer that we were manufactured
Now I've got the interviews on file
Which people said what
Which number to dial
So now every enemy screaming insanity
All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me
Bitch

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Can you believe that?
Like it's crazy, it sounds crazy right?
Like at this point, at this point you're thinking, you hear it out and you're like
"That guy was out of his mind"
But honestly that's what he wrote
Besides the fact that he wanted me to just play keyboard or whatever
He didn't want me to rap
He was like "Maybe Joe Hahn should, um
Wear a lab coat and a cowboy hat" on, like when we play
I swear to God he was crazy
And later on he claimed he wrote all our songs so that was really bad."[Verse 1 - Mike Shinoda]
Let's go ya'll

These people are running off at the mouth
Tryin to convince me that I'm running on empty
Tryin to convince themselves that the record
With Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm makin is a mistake
And I can't take this
Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playin'
Start askin me the names that I'm not sayin'
But I'm tryin to be bigger than the bickerin'
Bigger than the petty name callin'
Under the breath talkin
Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor
No patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talkin' while I'm walkin away

[Hook - John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
Cause my mind's made up anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say what you have to say
Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work today

[Verse 2 - Mike Shinoda]
You people are running off at the mouth
Tryin to make me take myself off safety
Tryin to make my friends turn their backs on the team we built
Buildin' up some mistaken information
And I can't take this
Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complain about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintainin my name, the same way I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playin'
Start asking the names that I'm not sayin'
But I'm tryin not to mention the names of people
Who wanna sight and attention
You like the hype but pretendin you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout
No class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talkin' while I'm walkin away
Bitch

[Hook]

[Bridge - John Legend]
Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to breathe (breathe, breathe)

Is anybody out there listening?
Cause I can't stand to keep this in
All I really want, I'll say it again (yeah, yeah)
(Like that)

[Hook](That beat is hard)

[Mike Shinoda]
This is how it goes
Welcome one and all to the show
We're wired up
Fired up
Fucking ready to go
In the back of the parking lot outside of the bar
Twenty deep
Twenty feet from the boulevard
Black hoodies
Black caps
Black label in glasses
Previewing the new shit before the masses
Cause the first thing I need when I've got a new beat
Is to see how it sounds
Echoing off the street
I just take it for a spin
Pop the CD in
Slide it up to ten and get that rearview shaking
Then play it again so there's no mistaking
San Andreas the block
Get this bitch earth quaking live

[Hook -Mike Shinoda]
Oh
Ready for it here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control
Letting everybody know
And if you feel it
Let me hear everybody go
Ohhh...

[Mike Shinoda]
You're not ready
I got plenty cuts for twenty months dropped steadily
Plenty tracks to empty on your wack pedigree
I'm backed heavily while you're backpeddling
Forget the chitchat on me homie
Kick back
I'm on that shit that can get your homie bitch-slapped
So zip your lip back
Listen and watch
We got the whole block rockin' off the way the beat knocks
You don't have to warn the people on the corner
They know
That if you're standing on that corner then you're getting that show
World premiering you're hearing that Machine Shop flow
San Andreas the block
Get this bitch earthquaking like

[Hook]

[Bridge - Mike Shinoda]
Turn the key
Turn the volume up to loud
Roll right
Roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all
Burn that system out

[Hook - 2x][Jay-Z:]
The record that you made
That's underground hiphop
Wi...with, with big sound
What, with big, with big sound
That protects it over, cause' the sound is so big
(it's an underground), that's an underground hiphop record
The richness of the music and everything
I know is gonna be somethin' serious[Intro: Mike's father]
"My father, came from Japan, in 1905
He was fifteen when he, immigrated from Japan
He, he, he worked until he was able to buy
To actually build a store"

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Let me tell you a story in the form of a dream
I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means
Close your eyes, just picture the scene
As I paint it for you; it was World War II
When this man named Kenji woke up
Ken was not a soldier, he was just a man
With a family who owned a store in L.A
That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids
He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran
He moved to L.A. from Japan
They called him immigrant, in Japanese
He'd say he was called "iisei"
That meant first generation
In the United States when
Everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs
But most of all afraid of a homeland attack
And that morning, when Ken went out on the doormat
His world went black, cause
Right there, front page news
Three weeks before 1942
Pearl Harbor's been bombed and "The Japs are Coming"
Pictures of soldiers dyin and runnin
Ken knew what it would lead to
And just like he guessed, the president said
"The evil Japanese in our home country would be locked away"
They gave Ken,a couple of days
To get his whole life packed in two bags
Just two bags, he couldn't even pack his clothes
And some folks didn't even have a suitcase
To pack anything in
So two trash bags, is all they gave them
And when the kids asked mom, "Where are we goin?"
Nobody even knew what to say to them
Ken didn't wanna lie
He said, "The U.S. is lookin for spies
So we have to live in a place called Manzanar
Where a lot of Japanese people are"
Stop it, don't look at the gunmen
You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin
If you're gonna run or not
Cause if you run then you might get shot
Other than that, try not to think about it
Try not to worry 'bout it bein so crowded
Cause someday we'll get out, someday, someday

[Sample: Mike's aunt]
"Yeah, soon as war broke out the FBI came and
They just come through the house and, you have to come
All the Japanese have to go
They took Mr. Ni, the people couldn't understand
Why they had to take him because he's an innocent laborer."

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin them
Every day every night, looked down at them
From watchtowers up on the wall
Ken couldn't really hate them at all
They were just doin their job and
He wasn't gonna make any problems
He had a little garden
Vegetables and fruits that he gave to the troops
In a basket his wife made
But in the back of his mind he wanted his family's life saved
Prisoners of war in their own damn country - what for?
And time passed in the prison town
He wondered if he'd live it down
If and when they were free
The only way out was joinin the Army, and supposedly
Some men went out for the army, signed on
And ended up flyin to Japan with a bomb
That 15 kiloton blast
Put an end to the war pretty fast
Two cities were blown to bits
The end of the war came quick
And Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life
With his kids and his wife, but
Then they got back to the home and
What they saw made him feel so alone
These people had trashed every room
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
Written on the walls and the floor
"Japs not welcome anymore!"
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides
And just stood outside
He - looked at his wife without words to say
She looked back at him wipin tears away
And, said someday we'll be okay, someday
Now the names have been changed but the story is true
My family was locked up back in '42
My family was there where it was dark and damp
And they called it an internment camp

[Outro: Mike's aunt]
"When we first got back from camp, uhh it was, pretty, pretty bad."
"I-I remember, my husband said, 'Ohh we're gonna stay 'til last.'
Then my husband died, before they closed the camp."This is not a story that you've heard or you know
Everyone in black from the head to the toe
And I'm sitting in the back in the very last row
Hearing everyone ask why I go

Ladies and gentlemen we're gathered here today
To talk about the end and a friend gone away
Talking about pretending, they don't know what to say
And they're tripping over words but they're talking anyway
Mingling and singing all these really sad songs
Talking of what I did right and forgetting all my wrongs
Saying how they'll miss me so much now that I'm gone
Man this is depressing
Let's move on

Let's move on
Come back to life like the light of the dawn
It's like a tightrope just move right along
Don't look down and don't step wrong
We don't have time so just move on

Friends from my past wiping tears on their sleeve
In between people that were never close to me
And as I turn my back on everyone to leave
I know that I'll be back to see them all eventually
I've gotta go away just to try something new
Cause what I'm used to isn't all that I can do
Just a change of scenery, just another view
Take it back to the beginning
Take it back to the roots

Let's move on
Come back to life like the light of the dawn
It's like a tightrope just move right along
Don't look down and don't step wrong
We don't have time so just move on
Come back to life like the light of the dawn
It's like a tightrope just move right along
Don't look down and don't step wrong
We don't have time so just move on

Just move on
Just move[Hook 1]
Y'all are not, not ready (No)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, how you doin y'all, my name's Mike
I'm foolin with the new shit I'm doin it all night
I like what I do, I do what I like
I could quit and get it back like I'm ridin a bike
Like stop, bring it back bring it back
We got that balance keeping us on track
That you get when you move and quit with no slow
You stare like you don't care but you do though
I know, you really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you tough, but so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really wanna hold me, show me homie
Let's get it over with for good
I got a friction addiction I wish you would
Machine Shop rockin when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

[Hook]
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)
Petrified (What)
Step aside and just drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on) Drop that (Come on)
Drop that (Come on)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Listen you are not ready
Like children in a building you can't stand steady
It must be the beat so heavy
Causing panic attacks like a crack in the levy
Give you that Robert Plant "Dancing Days" are back
Feeling all in the track and in fact
For those knowin the name
I'm back with some brand new crack
Who can do it like that
You really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you tough, but so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really wanna hold me, show me homie
Tough talk doesn't mean a thing
Get over yourself you know when we're up in a scene
It's Machine Shop rockin when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

[Hook] x2
Now why is everybody so petrified (What)

Machine Shop, shop, shop, shop..[Kenna]
Ohh-ohhhhh, ohh-ohhhhh
Ohh-ohhhhh, ohh-ohhhhh
Ohh-ohhhhh

[Mike Shinoda]
I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used to hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight
That his whole life, just changed
I know when his mom and dad broke up
It didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk
And he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seein red
Pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Then he'd do it all again
The whole time
Smilin on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside
All he was tryin to do was get away

[Hook: Jonah + Kenna]
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping, through the craaaaaaaacks

[Tak]
Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade
When you had it made it was all good
But now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one-two-three; lights out
Which way to turn, can't get a grip
All alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse
And you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left
Now you suffer, should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids
Can accept what you did
Now you wanna run away
But you can't cause the past comes back again

[Ryu]
Slippin through the cracks
Sip a little Jack, go to bed half dead
What about rent? Why does every cent
Gotta be a bet, when's it gonna end?
Oh my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Out of debt, out of dodge
Out of breath, out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick he was gonna think
The good Lord would come take him
I'm shakin him - "Wake up, you son of a BITCH!"

[Hook 2X: Jonah + Kenna]
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the craaaaaaaacks!
Hiding himself away
Watchin all the memories fade
Away from red to blaaaaaaaack!

[Kenna]
Slipping through the craaaaaaaacks {*3X*}[Hook]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Mike
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Makin' a story, makin' sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin it up, let's go

[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' 'em star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin' raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin' for someone's help, to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill
Eighty percent fear
Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, "Name Of The Game"
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach man, why you have the stupidest verse?
This dude is the truth, now everybody givi'n him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu The Sick
And he's spittin' fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
Been a fuckin' nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin', patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep askin' him, "Was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?"
No, he's livin' proof, got him rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doin', give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike
Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

[Hook x2]
