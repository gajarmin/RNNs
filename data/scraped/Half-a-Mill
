[Verse 1]
Uh woke in the mornin hoped out the water bed kissed my boo

Don't get it confused I'm gangsta, dunn my guns squeeze
My gators cost too much run from D's, cranberry and yellow

Nigga hello, drop bow's on 'em and lose your elbow

***In my world, Only You, things I do for a love

When I'm lettin off your fiance will call the wedding off
How she gonna marry a nigga -- when his head is off?
I rock Maury Gotors suits playa you in terry cluafs
I'm the bomb ask your mom, I drive some cherry's off

***In my world, Only You, I'mma do for a love

I'm like Barnabas, crap niggas try to conquer us
They mad, cuz they jump outta cabs and hop on the bus
Cop wit us, Firm click rock the whole Metropolis
Bitches who burn dick, won't put a stop to us
Niggas who turn snitch, gotta run
Coward you ain't a part of us
Send you flowers, you part of the dust
Hard to discuss, this ill life is hard to live up
Once you fall it's hard to get up
Once you ball it's hard to give up
See how it all started up from stick ups
In father's Dodge pickup, it wasn't really my fathers
But the pulley made it starter kick up
The money made even the hardest get stuck
The smartest get fucked, artist for what?
This world inside a mega mirror, niggas ain't promised tomorrow
Only thing you promised is projects
Fall prophets, 50 cent beers, S.S.I. checks
Prison bars, prison yards, knowledge thru wisdom God
Livin large, get with the mob, ain't nothin personal
Strictly a job, six in the heart, for six hundred lard
We gunnin hard, comin hard, hundreds and cars

Blow fire wit the gray seal, for laid real for this spit it

[Half-A-Mill]
I still rock Gucci sneakers, money green to match my cream
I don't sleep, niggas just blast in they dreams
You couldn't match my team
You ain't original, you like a fluke, Ron Howard beam
You was rockin Bugle Boys, had nothin, like for shootin boys
All of a sudden you Super Boy
You just a pigeon in the coup
Peace to them ill cats, livin the proof, manifestin the truth
Firm affil', landin jets on your roof
Exceptional, got a cess schedule, ganja festival
Prime line fish and vegetable, I'm skeptical
My man seen it thru his Cardiere spectacles, I'm tellin you
This BMW life is best for you
The ghetto brought out the hell in you
The heat took over the L in you
Copers of the wilderness, put the spell on you
What's left of you? Caught in the game, is like a hex on you
What's next to do? Not every one's chosen, just a few
I know it's fucked up, when everyone's holdin, except for you
Tough luck's gotten the best of you, we livin
Hummer wit the flying saucer engine, satellite system
Hype, travel at night, thru the ninth dimension
Every word, precise wisdom, varies verbs in this life I'm livin
My dunn shoot dice in prison, I would like to mention
My insight is like ice that's glisten
And took a page of my book and build Princeton
University, I move for this paper personally
You heard of me the first time your purchased a key
Feds got bitches, and niggas holdin bitches in g's
Cut you arms off, in case you got shits up ya sleeve
Split up the cheese, I got hollow tips for the dees
Pimpin disease, my bitches swallow ships in the sea
Black marquise, you ain't a player, you'se a car theft
Stomp you wit gators on, squash you like beef
Make it hard for your heart to beat
Spread ya hood, darken the streets
Market the beats, push stars weekend
Park in the streets, it's heat[Intro: Nature (Half-A-Mill)]
Yea, (uh huh) -- puff puff
We 'bout to do is -- puff puff

Mill Gates low calico, rollin that Cali dro
Roll wit the baddest ho, roll in that snow
Fold in that dough, playa you know my status quo
Gallons of 'mo, packed purple haze in the dutch
And I ain't passion to yo
Got cash in the stash money like fuck, but ain't flashin to yo
Benz buggy truck kidded up, no room for passenger
Bro "how the hell you gonna be a pimp and ain't a whip"?
Bitches gonna laugh at you
You I hit switches, switch sixes, big spliffs ridiculous
Officilous, nakedlious, chicks rub tits and lips and clit to this

While you day dreamin, I stay schemin
On your girls face I spray semen
Make her sip syrup cause she earl-up
I'mma still fuck her til she curle up
And when my nut purle up
I gotta block chocolate twirl up
Smoke the whole world up
Word up its murder
How we keep that ganja to burn up
If you like chronic, I mean chronic rewinders turn it up
We got pounds, clowns downs, cock suckers your turn is up
The Firm is up, Sopranos all we do is handle
Scrambble and gamble, roll out bamble
So high, Sosa holla out hola, wait I'm in cancun

Fuck that yo I'm dumpin yo
All day long all to the head, naw I might let one nigga know
Cause thirsty niggas be bringin they friends
Like please "can my dunn hit it yo"?
They call me anti-socialable, I done coached a few
Made poacher moves, see me when I got a show to do
Back stage pickin wit ho to screw
Show to improve or showin off
I hear 'em pistols goin off
No insurance on my whip
I crash like I don't know the cost
Laughin then I leave it there
Leave the place, leave the tapes
Take the guns from under the seats
Cause niggas know, I don't need the case
I ain't the one to be laughin at or laughin wit
I'm action packed, catch me where the cashs at
Or any smoke shops after that

[Chorus]
The streets, the spots, the thugs, the guns
Thuggest Enemy #1
The projects, the hood, the hustlers, the slums
Thuggest Enemy #1
The crills, the kizzo, the wizzy, the guns
Thuggest Enemy #1
The dramas, the murders, the shootouts, the slums
Thuggest Enemy #1

[Half-A-Mill]
No matter how much love you show, they still hate
I'm great, nobody build cake like Mill Gates
If I'm not in the Benz dunn, I'm whippin the eight
Thug Onez, hundreds of guns, I'm from the slums
Drug funds, most of my sons, is on the run
Some is in jail, be home, when they a hundred and one
Used to breakdance and windmill under the sun
The ghetto turned us out, we slang crills and pull burners out
Project hallways, yo, I rob niggas in the doorway
Cop four-four, half a key and raw
I went from nickels and dimes, fiends askin me for more
Niggas mad cuz I see cash, they don't want no war
I bust big guns, they never seen before
Creep up on ya building, spray submachines thru ya door
Kidnap ya seeds and your whore, and I'll be back for more
50 G's for sure, make grandma lay on the floor

[Chorus]

[Half-A-Mill]
Pro player, extort papi in that bodega
For number slip chips, plus he frontin bricks
The minute convict, twenty inch drums, on the six
Lookout, here he come, bop beat on hand sticks
You wanna chance this, left his brain on the stand smiths
Pure cocaine, money is law, I play no games
Go range, don't even drive slow when it rain
Jakes on my trail, like Roscoe, Pekoe, Cold Tray
Milion be my code name, Mill Gates be my whole name
Terrorist, I'll blow you to frame
Professionalist, lick shots and never miss, cleverest, yo
I leave homicide scenes, the ho's headless
I was born, raised, inside a world wit no exit
Bitches throw hectic, put pussy juice in you breakfast
You got beef wit me, better push ya bulletproof Lexus
I sip hundred proof and shoot weapons, steppin

[Chorus]

[Half-A-Mill]
What you know about the project
Peace God, mind detect, mine direct, fire my tech
Diamond shines on my neck, iceberg sweat
First and the third, bubblin birds
Fuck what your heard, puffin some herb
For real son, none wrong wit no herbs
Whoadi outta line, whoadi get what he deserve
You got some nerve, try to slang rock in my turf
When I get through wit you, you won't need a doctor or nurse
Or a hearse, I disintegrate, niggas who imitate
Try to infiltrate, I eliminate in your fit
I'm into kicks, makes and snakes
Brakes money, label the space
Get money, take money, fuck you think
Milliato, type of kid you like to hate
Push a six hundred, fuck the feds on the license plate
I want for this bread, some say it's gon to my head
They just mad, cuz all they chicks is all in my bed
Fake killas in your head, say I wanted them dead
Till they saw the infrared, ski mask and fake dreads
Ya niggas is coward, ya don't brake bread, I break heads
And I don't bring a hundred niggas wit me, I bring lead instead

[Chorus 2X](Biggie Sample)
Where BK at? Where BK at?
(Repeat 4x)

Verse 1:
We gon' blow off the roof ya'll
I cop somethin' from the juice bar
Holdin', rollin' in a new car
BK be my borough, mad thorough
Make sure that cash double
Gats blast through your ass muscle
I got the pieces to the puzzle
My Dogs don't wear leashes or muzzles
Everyday's a hustle
We used to roam the streets, hoppin' trains, back of the bus too
Play stick ball
Now we stick ya'll
Out to get it all, been through it and did it all
Wit' it all, plan to cop a new World and split it all
Been rich, been poor
Spendin' ends in the Benz store
Shittin' like Diarrhea
With enough cash to buy Aaliyah
Buy her some weed, drive high speed, take her to the projects and beat
Her
My name Mill, pack Millimeters
Silver heater, tracks kill the speaker
Ill speaker, ill wisdom leaker
Build from the street up
Real from my feet up
Mill 'bout to heat up a meal you can eat up
I'm from the streets where them crooks is at
What you lookin' at?
Where Brooklyn at?

Chorus -
Where ya at? where ya at?
(Where Brooklyn at? where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
(Repeat 4x)

Verse 2:
Brooklyn, Brooklyn, funky funky fresh
I be the greatest entertainer since Dough E. Fresh
Bring the pain like my Man Kane
Gucci frames like Dana Dane
It ain't a game, but things change
Still spit flames, lyrical flame
Lyrical rain, my slang bang and injure your brain
With minimal game rap indivuals get slain
Go get your crew
Whoever you bring is gonna lose
Officialist dude
Who wants a lyricists fued?
I'll make lyrical food out of you gimmickal fools
Give him some weed, give him some dust, give him some booze
He ain't ballin', he fallin', better give him some room
He him up, split him up, let his bodyguards get him up
We party hard in Brooklyn and we don't give a fuck
Of course money, I floss money like Sauce Money
Pop Cris' and poor bubbly 'till we all ugly
I'm a Mack, chicks all love me
Whether on the train or in a Porsche buggy
I get brain lovely
4.6 Range, keep the change money
Jigga, Bleek, and Dame is doin' they thing Money
M.O.P.'s a friend of me, Buckshot's the energy
Cocoa Brovaz a kin to me, O.G.C.'s the entity
I'm a real MC, somethin' most pretend to be
But you get fried in the end when you pretend to be....from them streets
Where the crooks is at
What you lookin' at?
Where Brooklyn at?

Chorus -

Verse 3:
Rap cats wanna screw me
Who me? my crew be unruly like B.I.G. thats why I brung Uzi's
Who wanna move me?
I'll send shots through your Coogi
Hop in a Benz drop Coupe smoothly
Dippin' through blocks when I lick shots
Rippin' through drops
Sinister plots
Sinnin' to deminish your spot
Criminal niggas with knots
Glistenin' watch, Linen's is hot
Keep lyricists fearin' to rock
Mission is stopped
We gon' do it like this to the top
Twistin' the pot
Don't get it twisted or I'm twistin' your knot
Pickin' the lock
What I spit leaves your sick in your socks
Kickin' the box, mad rappers lookin' at Ox
I smash rappers
Stocked in this market, I crash rappers
Slash rappers, they nothin' but garbage so I trash rappers
Front on me and be ass backwards
I got it mastered, pack gats to blast Bastards
I'm from the streets where them Crooks is at
What you lookin' at?
Where Brooklyn at?

Chorus[Intro: Half-A-Mill]
Uh huh, yea, yea, word

[Verse 1]
When I'm on the mic I rock the mic right
When I'm on the block I rock the block right
Thousand grams of that chIna white
Five o'clock in the mornin
Out on that corner bubble straight to that night
And we sell bricks, still handle some jail shit
Gram to gram, cannon in the CL 6
I'm a born hustler, takin all of ya costumers
My dimes bigger then your 20's dawg 'em fiends run for us
Uh, from the gutter, my wakes stay butter
Voice spot on sutter
No time for toy cops, snitches or free lowin bitches
Kisses, Mrs's, I'm tryin to put these ki's in your britches
And get this...money, and you can keep your brain
I'm like new and improved willy dynamite, deep in the game
My neck surrounded by ice, four pounds
Homey down semi's keep more rounds
They wit me for life
I squeeze 50 in the kidney in Christ
Lord forgive me but this thug shit is in me pissy drunk of Henny
Lil' man got truck on 20's, I mean 22's
We rub pennies together and turn 'em into jewels

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Da Hustle Don't Stop (don't stop)

You faggots is wack, I stay on my grind, actioned pack

What your crew gonna do when these slugs come for you?
Beside run and duck, son ain't tryin to fuck wit you
Died over a buck or two
I'm tryin to cop a truck or two
Truck his jewels, ain't got no love for you fools
While you puffin 'em oo's, I'm stuffin my shoes
Thugged out, you know the rules, I ain't tryin to lose

Wit that rollie that move faster then Chinese food
Keep my mind on my loot

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Da Hustle Don't Stop (it don't stop)

Still livin on top (Half-A-Mill)
Up in the club Crys' and Henny to pop

[Verse 3]
We went from Medicaid to Escalades
Your boys hella paid
I rock 360 waves instead of braids
Born hustler, federal trade, flexed wit a gage
Up in the mansion gettin head from the maid
Came a long way from federal raise, neva been played
I should get an award on every Veterans Day
Word to the Lord, get mine, or I'm murkin you broad
Dawg I neva put that metal away
Why wait for the 'morrow? for somethin we can settle today
Just lift off the clips and let the chips lay where they made
From the A to the K I make 'em pay what they weight
Day to day, I guess I neva change my ways
Niggas hatin cause my chains is gray
Straight shittin leave stains on 'em
Let the four pounds bang on 'em
I rains on 'em, from Spring to Autumn
The game is callin, you know Half-A-Mill stay guard
From wake of the horror, Queens to Brooklyn
Who let the crooks in? I'm jooks in
Niggas done bring the hooks in

Chicks wanna get at phatty up

Still keep purple haze, packed in the dutch
Pushin big Benz 'round the way, thats wussup
Came along way from takin the train and back of the bus
Aches and pains, ballin out major wit game
Blingin the chain, pull to the Bank in the Range
Haters mad cause I made some change
Figure stack, I'm shittin, leavin major stains
Figure that!, I'm hittin spittin

And after the party we know I'mma stroke her up

[Chorus: Hersanity]

[Verse 2]

Come here ma I won't' bite then again I just might

And my flow is so right, dough is so right
Been 'round the world all I got is more nights and more ice
Been 'round your girl in cold nights

Hot as can be, beats bumpin out of my V's
Got the streets thumpin, get up vibe wit me

[Chorus: Hersanity]

Summer time, pockets bulgin, knots is swollen
Money foldin I'm holdin, wrist is frozen

Yea, chicks that's holdin, do your thing ma

Hard as a rock holla back sweet enough to swallow that
This be the tough ma bounce to that
Champaign bottle rounds, ounce to blat

Straight out the hood, snake bites tired of 'em Jake light

What's next to do? Not every one's chosen, just a few
I know it's fucked up, when everyone's holdin, except for you
Tough luck's gotten the best of you, we livin
Hummer wit the flying saucer engine, satellite system
Hype, travel at night, thru the ninth dimension
Every word, precise wisdom, varies verbs in this life I'm livin
My dunn shoot dice in prison, I would like to mention
My insight is like ice that's glisten
And took a page of my book and build Princeton
University, I move for this paper personally
You heard of me the first time your purchased a key
Feds got bitches, and niggas holdin bitches in g's
Cut you arms off, in case you got shits up ya sleeve
Split up the cheese, I got hollow tips for the dees
Pimpin disease, my bitches swallow ships in the sea
Black marquise, you ain't a player, you'se a car theft
Stomp you wit gators on, squash you like beef
Make it hard for your heart to beat
Spread ya hood, darken the streets
Market the beats, push stars weekend
Park in the streets, it's heat[Chorus]
Some niggas Blood and some niggas Crip
Some niggas thugs and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin some niggas rich
Some niggas die frontin and some livin the shit

Chorus 2x

[Verse 1]
Ayo, we play for keeps, taught from day one how to blaze the heat
Three-hundred and sixty ways to eat, razor blade your meat
I'm getting something, if not, then I'm hitting something
Definetley, especially if my ribs is touching
Out for mine, for your shines I'll blow you out your mind
You could throw a thousand signs
I'm only concerned about the dollar signs
Stashing my cheese, stashing my crack in back of my Fi
State to state, nationally!
Actually, factually
I'll fracture every member of your faculty, send your cavalry!
I got M1's and macs with me, send your cash to me
I'll have them niggas scared to ask for me
Throw your man off the Tappanzee
Other members of your running, where the traffic be?
Highland, he busting big guns, they coming after me
I'm wilding, real live shit, ain't no acting B
It's not a game, we ain't playing
Dun, we spraying, won't stop till everyone laying on the pavement
Every nigga you came with is getting painted
We specialize in wetting guys, technicalize
Smith & Wessun-ilize, I've seen the best of them die
Especially, testing I, put the teck to your eye
So you can see death, take a deep breath
And say goodbye, Why!?

Chorus 2x

[Verse 2]
Streets is too real, thug nowadays is to ill
Fuck a hundred thou, I need a few mil
Even if it leaves you killed
You resting in peace, I rest with blue steel
I'm even wetting police and Navy blue seals
How crazy you feel!?
Militant click, ten in the whip
I know Bohemians with, plenty of chips
Pull this off and we'll be rich, filthiest top billing milkiest
In the Hamptons, out on the mansions where they live
They on some ram shit, Hindu niggas, reading sanscrit
I want a man by every exit so they can't split
Rush the crib, all we see is candles lit
Yo, they got gold cows, gold owls, on some chanting shit
Tie them up, red dot them up, fuck the ransom shit
Hit the safe, chips in the case, back to the whip
Dun, we laced, back to BK, Albany,relaxed in the PJ's
Splitting mathematics on a weekday
South of P chases stuffed inside of briefcases quiet money!
Keep our mouth shut like freemasons paid men

Chorus 2x

[Verse 3]
We from the housing bricks pushing year two-thousand whips
We went from ounces to bricks, house on the cliff
Thousands on the wrist, got a crew of wild villains
Thats down to flip, down to spit
Real live thugs above the counterfeit
Real live drug, under the counter shit, a pound a hit
Who you riding with might be the nigga you dying with
Shot on fire we shot niggas cause they was wired kid
New drops up, pull rooftops up
Shoot your spots up, put pirranas in your hot tub
Might be a bomb under the cork next time you pop bub, nigga!Yeah...this that shit we bump when we outta town....

Chorus
What you ridin' ridin'?
What you rollin' rollin'?
What you lightin' lightin'?
What you smokin' smokin'?
What you countin' countin'?
What you holdin' holdin'?
Who you pimpin' pimpin'?
Them bitches hoin' hoin'
(Repeat)

Verse 1: (Nature)
Now once you fuck with me bet your life is over
I got more hoes than Tyson Botha
Bite ya shoulder, bite ya earlobe
Weeks go by, I let my beard grow
Ya'll lookin' like ya'll tough but ya'll scared though
These rap cats is wierdos
I zone where no Man would dare go
I'm like the President, testifyin' didn't swear though
I fear no Man, not even the Lord
My niggas still pumpin crack, got a reason to score
We made it sweet in NewYork
Some fake Muslim niggas still eat pork
All I do is write the rhyme and let the weed talk
Tell it like it is
Gangster chronicles, credit the Bridge
Ironic, we keep it thugged out, it's better for kids
This time it's Nature shreddin' your myths, shreddin' your fame
Fake Willies gettin' settlement money step in the game
Get their own label, first act fly, don't recoup
Niggas records ain't hot, then niggas owe loot
Now what you gon' do?

Chorus 2x

Verse 2: (Half-a-Mill)
Yo Son, we shine like tons of Platinum
Refined minds, my guns double action
My Duns gettin' head, relaxin'
I wanna see bread in fractions
Thorough reaction, vest on your chest
Metal packin', S on your chest
We rip the S off
God forbid we have to hit them tecks off
Flip your wig and rip the lid of your Lex off
I'm deeper than your best thoughts
Who the fuck you gonna extort?
Hold trial in the streets, I'll smack the judge in front of his court
Public assault
Nine-point-Nine stuffed in the vault
We ain't lyin', we roll out on those Hawaiin resorts
Keep your eyes on the Hawks
Cause they spy on your corpse
We the best in this, private jets fly off the loft
Deadliest, metal heavy like Isrealeans
On the Jersey turnpike me and the God spotted the Aliens
I burn mics and bury ends
Who am I?
I'm like Y2K causin' your computer to die
Right....

Chorus 2x

Verse 3: (Nature)
While corner stores sell beers to minors
Nearsighted cops arrestin' mad niggas just cause they wearin' diamonds
They say I'm steerin' clients
They said they got my on tape, the Panasonic
Put the knot to my head, my Man got it
And they can't stop it
They never could and never will
Fuck a misdemeanor dun, my crimes be fede-rill
Until we net a Mil I won't spend shit
Won't lend shit
I can't see shit
Cause thugs can't keep shit

Verse 4: (Half-a-Mill)
With buds and a weed spliff
Drugs and the heat kid
Up in the Precinct jakes took your G's and told you to beat it
Whats the root of all this green shit?
Submachines and submarines
Them ghetto hoes that only fuck for cream
Hope she buffed you off before she stuck your team
Fuck what you talk
We thugs from NewYork with guns that shoot off
Whether you hard or soft you still get knocked off
Quicker than these crills get knocked off
My bills still top yours
Cris' still popped off

Chorus 4x(Verse 1: Half a Mill)
Me and my man used to get dough, before he got hit yo
This type of skit i can't forget no
Shit go like this, we was chillin' had three L's
62 on the scale, givin' details about females
He passed the Alize and said my mans comin' for pick up
I took a sip it made me hiccup, i filled the clip up, in case a stick up
He said half chill its aight, ease
Save these for enemies, these niggas got g's for keys
Won't be no casaulties, he said these niggas is peeps
Imma take the weight to the jeep, hit the cash and imma leap
So i went to the fridge for a rare taste, he left the crib and hit the staircase
I turned his tv on and saw the man's face
Then i turned on the nintendo, as i lit up the endo
I heard gunshots outside the window
Its my friend yo, layin' front infront the buildin'
I didn't really realise shit was real until then
See, thats what i mean niggas get killed for this green
This story lies between another homicide scene

(hook)
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
See what i mean another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
Everydays another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine

Damn, another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine

(verse 2 : Half a Mill)
Word is bond another homicide scene
I was headed to the cleaners , to get my fila suit out
A nigga ran behind me grabbed my pocket, tried to snatch my loot out
A grabbed my gat squeezed off and as bullets shoot out
He got hit, the blood oozed out, panicked and tryed to move out
I hopped in my ride so i can cruise out
I got to find a new route, coz imma loose out
Soon as these snitches get the news outs
I head back to the projects on (????) and prospect
You get murdered for material objects
The profit'll drop , topics like fiber optics
My instinct and sniper logics got me blastin off like hyper rockets
Coz the streets is mad wild
Niggas is mad foul
They have a nigga coppin' out at trial
Before the jury reads the verdict
15 for slayin' a teen
Another homicide scene

(hook)
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
Everydays another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
Damn, another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine

See what i mean another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine

Word is bond another homicide scene
The way its told nowadays niggas is made from trife
The streets is cold 15 year olds is facin' life
In the max, shortys puttin' slugs in niggas back with a mac
Takin ya stack and half an ounce of crack
Niggas be headed out of state with weight
To get paid it be great, jakes sprayed now yous an inmate
Amongst ya peers with no fears
Your eyes got flooded with tears
When the judge said 60 years
Huh, i wander downlow these days takin' it easy
Niggas is buckwildin' in the PJ's
Runnin' up in niggas cribs
Bustin' shot , stray bullets be hittin' kids, bloodstains left on the babys bib
Undevine true indeed, its hard to percieve
When ya seed had to bleed over a pound of weed
See what i mean niggas get killed for this green
This story lie between another homicide scene

Yea, yea, uh huh
Uh huh, yea, uh, huh
Dedicated...to all the ladies out there
Half-A-Mill, how can I trust you?
Uh, yea, uh huh

[Verse 1]
When we first started out it was lust
Now you talkin marriage and trust
Carriage for us, baby carriage
Your love nearly made me savage
You like it when I grab it
And twist you backwards and let you have it
Sexual magic, you like it when you get ya ass whipped
You need a man to take over, see you in your Range Rover
Hoped off the 11th hundred, made you pull that thing over
Went from what's your name to Champaign to hangover
Now you want me for yourself so we became closer
Blazin haze on the sofa, no more spendin days watchin Opera
We eatin Lobster at the Copa, monster hat wit the toaster
Poppin Velvet, makin a toaster
A new relationship wit that's Kosher
Plan to make it last forever
But tell me can I trust ya?
How I know you ain't creepin wit another buster
How I know someone else ain't rubbin butter
All over my lover, can I trust you?

**How could I trust you -- anythin you eva need it**

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Uh, uh huh, uh huh, yea, uh
Can I trust you?, can I trust you?
Uh, uh huh, yea, uh, uh huh
How can I trust you?, how can I trust you?

[Verse 2]
Spinnin the five, call you up spend some time
I'm like Ginuwine I got flowers and the wine
Conversate wit you for hours, stimulatin ya mind
On a rainy day I'll make it shine
Bring ring field wit mines
Enough ice to make you blind
But that's still won't make you mine
You prolly like to play wit my mind
Make me chase you around and you body like di-da-damn
So you know I had to bling you down
Waitress bring around of that drink wit the crown
You prolly tired paintin in town
Ma let me put that mink down
I roll enough to snake now
You poppin drinks that blue berry haze got ya eyes shank now
We at the steak house, came along way from take-outs
Police stake outs, lets take a vacation and break out
Let's go to Africa where the Zebra's and Apes is out
Go under -- a waterfalls so I can blaze you out
But can I trust you?

**How could I trust you -- anythin you eva need it**

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Uh, uh huh, uh huh, yea, uh
Can I trust you?, can I trust you?
Uh, uh huh, yea, uh, uh huh
James Brown, yea, uh huh
Can I trust you? can I trust you?

[Verse 3]
Sippin a glass of Reds, you tellin other cats is dead
Want to get married, every since I hit you wit the Jagged Edge
You can throw that thing away wit the plastic head
Cause I'm packin a lead that got you grabbin the bed
You neva knew that your back spread so much
Is like I got your soul touched
Hardened stiff still won't nut
'Til you errupt like a Volcano, I feel you liver
Feel you mama puttin you through physical drama
Yo the dick tellin your mama
Your friends say I got you whipped
Tellin chicks its natural Phenomena
Is like sumthin magical, how I attracted you
The conversatin captured you
Have you sippin Carot-chews
Blazin hazin black roots mixed wit absolute
Tree or life, come here ma let me grab ya fruit
Unites are ripe, heres a lil ice for ya life
Imagine if you was my wife
But can I trust you for life?

**How could I trust you -- anythin you eva need it**

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Uh, uh huh, uh huh, yea, uh
Can I trust you?, can I trust you?
Uh, uh huh, yea, uh, uh huh
James Brown, yea, uh huh
Can I trust you?

[Outro]
Yea you talkin all this yaknawmean?
Word, you talkin 'bout relationship
And feelin and commitments yaknawmean?
Word, I can like you, I can love you
But can I trust you?[Intro: Half-A-Mill]
Uh huh, yea, yea, word
Yea, Half-A-Mill, Half-A-Mill
Yea, send this out to my true hustlers
Uh huh, true ballers, yea, word
Hustle don't stop baby, it don't stop
Neva stop son, it ain't gonna neva stop

[Verse 1]
When I'm on the mic I rock the mic right
When I'm on the block I rock the block right
Thousand grams of that chIna white
Five o'clock in the mornin
Out on that corner bubble straight to that night
And we sell bricks, still handle some jail shit
Gram to gram, cannon in the CL 6
I'm a born hustler, takin all of ya costumers
My dimes bigger then your 20's dawg 'em fiends run for us
Uh, from the gutter, my wakes stay butter
Voice spot on sutter
No time for toy cops, snitches or free lowin bitches
Kisses, Mrs's, I'm tryin to put these ki's in your britches
And get this...money, and you can keep your brain
I'm like new and improved willy dynamite, deep in the game
My neck surrounded by ice, four pounds
Homey down semi's keep more rounds
They wit me for life
I squeeze 50 in the kidney in Christ
Lord forgive me but this thug shit is in me pissy drunk of Henny
Lil' man got truck on 20's, I mean 22's
We rub pennies together and turn 'em into jewels

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Da Hustle Don't Stop (don't stop)
Get money, we count master got the government hot (word)
Da Hustle Don't Stop (Da Hustle Don't Stop)
Fiends runnin the spot hundred to pop
And we huggin the block
Da Hustle Don't Stop (yea)
Comin through on the drop
Block flooded fiends rubbin 'em rocks (Half-A-Mill)
Da Hustle Don't Stop (uh)
Still livin on top
I bring the club Cris and Henny to pop

[Verse 2]
I put the pedal to the metal
Coke in the kettle
It's Hell on Earth, got fiends smokin the devil
Niggas scotin my bezle, the ice bling
Like lightnin you flash your gat I fire at thing
You faggots is wack, I stay on my grind, actioned pack
32 from mac, ain't no bringin you back
What your crew gonna do when these slugs come for you?
Beside run and duck, son ain't tryin to fuck wit you
Died over a buck or two
I'm tryin to cop a truck or two
Truck his jewels, ain't got no love for you fools
While you puffin 'em oo's, I'm stuffin my shoes
Thugged out, you know the rules, I ain't tryin to lose
I'm supplyin 'em dudes
Wit that rollie that move faster then Chinese food
Keep my mind on my loot

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Da Hustle Don't Stop (it don't stop)
Get money, we count master got the government hot (uh huh)
Da Hustle Don't Stop (neva)
Fiends runnin the spot hundred to pop
And we huggin the block
Da Hustle Don't Stop (it don't stop)
Comin through on the drop
Block flooded fiends rubbin 'em rocks
Da Hustle Don't Stop
Still livin on top (Half-A-Mill)
Up in the club Crys' and Henny to pop

[Verse 3]
We went from Medicaid to Escalades
Your boys hella paid
I rock 360 waves instead of braids
Born hustler, federal trade, flexed wit a gage
Up in the mansion gettin head from the maid
Came a long way from federal raise, neva been played
I should get an award on every Veterans Day
Word to the Lord, get mine, or I'm murkin you broad
Dawg I neva put that metal away
Why wait for the 'morrow? for somethin we can settle today
Just lift off the clips and let the chips lay where they made
From the A to the K I make 'em pay what they weight
Day to day, I guess I neva change my ways
Niggas hatin cause my chains is gray
Straight shittin leave stains on 'em
Let the four pounds bang on 'em
I rains on 'em, from Spring to Autumn
The game is callin, you know Half-A-Mill stay guard
From wake of the horror, Queens to Brooklyn
Who let the crooks in? I'm jooks in
Niggas done bring the hooks in

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**

[Outro: Half-A-Mill]
Half-A-Mill, uh, Half-A-Mill, Brooklyn
Yea, (Da Hustle Don't Stop)
New York City, Ali papa, the crime don't stop
Uh huh, (Da Hustle Don't Stop) neva!
Crown Heights projects, Brooklyn
(Da Hustle Don't Stop) New York City
All over Brooklyn, the whole Universe
Yo, (Da Hustle Don't Stop) neva stops y'all
**fades to the end**Verse 1:
Chicks call me up and say ooh we done heard
You stopped poppin' Cristal nigga, now you sippin' Louie The Third
Moved to Jers, now it's like you moved from Earth
Shoes and furs
You know how much these jewels is worth?
I'm playin' hardball, you usin' a nerf
Haul the Porsche to the Golf course
My Daddy's a mob boss
My Daddy fell off course
But I'm still well off in the loft
Ill fella, Ladies faint during intercourse
Control a bitch' mind like I invented whores
Mack without a Goldie hat or a Six-Four
I got cash and plan to get more
Of that cream chicks strip for, lick dick for
Hopin' they can get rich for
Up in the Benz door openin' up the Six door
I had you more open than that when I entered your pores
Had your Tits stiff plus made you strip to your drawers
I don't stop 'till I get it get it and get it some more

Chorus (Changing Faces)
Loving you is easy cause you're beautiful
You brighten up my day and I never wanna see you go away
(Repeat)

Verse 2:
Milion`
For the streets we burn Phillies on
To the same streets we turned Willie on
Catch me spillin' Dom
I was a Don before Beneton
I been on since they wrote the Kuran
Three-Sixty waves with the spin on
Quarter-bills with the brim on
Try to slaughter Mils
I have no choice but to draw the steel
I'm hard, somethin' that every broad 'll feel
Like a climax, this rod 'll get all the way to your back
I'll have your Wifey fightin' you back
Light on the gat
Send my Son to pick her up, she jumps right in the Ac'
She chose me, you know B., why even ask?
Now have a nice day, cause it might be your last
Stay cool like ice in a glass
I made these rules, you might could use a class
Tune in to the Mack
Let me introduce you to the facts on shoes and hats
Jewels and stacks
The rules are flat
I was through with that before you knew what to do with that

Chorus 2x

(Bridge)
Half-a-Mill ya'll
Half-a-Mill ya'll
Half-a-Half-a-Half-a-Half-a-Half-a-Mill ya'll
Half-a-Mill ya'll
Half-a-Mill ya'll
Half-a-Half-a-Half-a-Half-a-Half-a-Mill ya'll

Verse 3:
Niggas always love me
I get my dick soaked in bubbly
So lovely I got your chick tellin' you "Nigga, don't touch me"
She don't smoke but she roll dutchies
She was a nice girl now she exposed the hole in her butt-cheeks
Ride the pole 'till the nut leaks
I taught her how to swallow my soul and spit up somethin' sweet
And you wonder why she got your jeep
I turned her out in these streets
Now she's ballin' with freaks
Went from Menage's to Tri-Quadre's, ill ho
Still feel Mill though
Trips on for real yo
I'm the reason why she threw away her dildo
Flew Ki's over Frisco
It glow, baguettes glisten like the crystal in a disco
You a rich ho, on my dick though
Bought a nigga that Six-O
Ten AV's
Cockin' ya Fifth when your bitch page me
Breakin' your Cellular
She said "Nigga I'm tellin' ya
I'd die for the Hell of ya, roll lye in the L for ya
Tell lies in Philadelphia
Use my Chocha to get bail for ya"

Chorus 4X[Half-A-Mill]
It ain't right, if it ain't rough, gettin paid's a must
We made the bucks, even the player's hate us
Is it the way we shine Gordiere gear since '89
And shorty wit diamonds from South African mines
Now it's '99, nearly 2 G, still in coogie
Crib wit Jacuzzi, it is in the movie
I take a shit, grippin the uzi
Plan to make ya rich, smoothly, on the low
Fuck a new V, on the run like Kool G
Marijuana twist, camouflage sis
On some hard shit, charge like a platinum card, kid
Enter the wild life, Crystal life, I'd rather die twice
Before I eat, four chicken wings and fried rice
Yo dunn, we high price, we news of the world
White wine type, I don't like swine type
No bullshit we, strictly chronic to life
Bionic wit mics, seein shit with astronomical sight, tropin night
Laid up, after the fight, live from cocktail Milion
Land like alien, in Roswell
Fly as hell, mad clientele, light up a L
Hot enough to cause fires in hell

[Hook]
Fire (fire), burnin (burnin)
It's like fire (fire), burnin (burnin)
It's like fire (fire), burnin (burnin)
Hot enough to cause fires in hell, fires in hell

[Half-A-Mill]
Stupid reefer, still ride Gucci sneakers
Ill, your shit can kill for the phone, if I leave her
I ain't a player, I just get buffed a lot
Somethin hot must of dropped, headed up top
On the lee-lo, we know, niggas don't want us to see dough
See us flossin, you swear to God we rob Tito's
Car paid for, smack the shit outta the repo
Every verse is kilo, in the streets yo
Thoroughbred exquisite, escalate mega digits
Head twisted, on the red, by vet bitches
Super fly son, movin my gun, born on the run
More to come, all in one, luxurious fallen on
Notorious baller, dunn, peep the prognosis
I be the high explosive, burnin bushes like Howard Moses
Higher dosage, chocolate roasted
Made ya team, without a coach kid, chrome toasted

[Hook]

[Half-A-Mill]
Project general, wise criminal
Five percent of two, biochemical, nine emeralds
Rubies, sapphire, who be the most higher?
Insult liars, don't try us, get your coke tied up
Throat tied up, we lay til the coke dry up
Race like relays, day and night in V.A
You want a key and yay, see a
You ain't got the dough we spray, fuck the D.A
Truck breeze away, material world
Big guns, wit scratched serial world
My cats put an end to your world
Twistin ya girl, hot spittin, pissin ya girl
But she's the freak at night, back seat of the jeep type
Holdin heat type, New World Order of the catamites
War over water, Babylon Six, we the light
We the life givin forces, in this fortress
Of hidden forces, design to trick and torture

Pushin big Benz 'round the way, thats wussup
Came along way from takin the train and back of the bus

Blingin the chain, pull to the Bank in the Range
Haters mad cause I made some change
Figure stack, I'm shittin, leavin major stains
Figure that!, I'm hittin spittin

And my flow is so right, dough is so right

Hard as a rock holla back sweet enough to swallow that

Straight out the hood, snake bites tired of 'em Jake light

[Chorus: Hersanity]

[Outro: Hersanity & (Half-A-Mill)
Let me know you feel this, yeaaaa
We gotta get on up
(Yea, Half-A-Mill, thats right
Mike James in the Range, everybody get up...)Verse 1:
I used to watch you in the schoolyard while you jump rope
Baretts in your hair, fresh gear, your Brothers pump dope
I approached you but no others could come close, I used to buy you
Slices of Pizza and Strawberry iceys
Gentleman style, always talkin' very nicely
Everytime we played House I'd be the Husband you the Wifey
Mom dukes whoopin' your ass because you liked me
Walkin' down the block switchin' ya ass tryin' to excite me
I still have those letters that you used to write me
About how since we met up you see the future brightly
Young love, smooth and politely
Untouched
My one touch had you sprung up
On the phone for hours
I told you before we hung up, "Young stuff, this World is ours"
Together Girl we can make a better World
My ghetto Girl....

Chorus -
You're my ghetto girl in a ghetto World
For you I'd dead the World
I'll never forget my ghetto girl
You're a ghetto girl in a ghetto World
Gave me a better World
I'll never forget my ghetto girl
You're a ghetto girl in a ghetto World
For you I'd dead the World
I'll never forget my ghetto girl

Verse 2:
I still spend days reminiscin'
Age changed, different livin'
Cables and chains, waves spinnin'
Had you in the projects, the Gods knowledged you as my Wisdom
Always around tryin' to lock me down like Prison
I saw your vision
Always wishin' for the day we'd have kids'n
Wedding and a Cristening
Baguettes around your wrist'n
Chicks used to say to you always "Why you stick with him?"
"Every conversation we have you always mention him"
In all actuality they just mad cause I ain't get with them
And all the Men they ever had seemed to split on them
But I ain't gonna do you like those Cats did to them
Hustlin' cracks, bustin' the MAC so nice clothes can cover your back
You lovin' me and I'm lovin' you back
Rubbin' your back
Can't nobody tell you other than that

Chorus -

Verse 3:
Out of this World
No more Guess, you're a Gibana girl
Givin' me Sex, you were a "I guess I'll try it" girl
Still into baguettes, Tennis set type of World
Black Queen Nefertiti in the flesh in my World
In the best of my World
You're obsessed with my World
I'd tell you how much I was blessed since you stepped in my World
I loved to caress you and express to you
I only want whats best for you
Sexin' you in unforgettable ways, I treasure you
Pleasure you to an extent thats imeasureable
It's terrible, with every intent to put the spell on you
Share with you
In Eight-Fifty-I's you see a clearer view
Here boo, this Six is for you
I want you to live it too

Chorus[Half A Mill]
While my hustlers be on corner, L caught in bright shines
Versace bitch snortin white lines, ridin my pipe line
The name's Half A Mill, but ladies choose to call me Nighttime
Relax on sofas, reef it up, sippin white wine
Ya bodies rockin, Power U, that of the tight kind
Thug brown and light dime, inspire me to write rhymes
You got me goin, blowin my sexual omen
The only ho in this world, to whom Half A Mill's dosed it
I'm sailin on yachts, coast to coastin, grossin potion
While you droppin off weight on Albany, mistral notion
I be back in two months, with foreign currency
English pounds for you mosquito soprano's and licorice gowns
Parion, battle rounds, I'm be the King from Crown
I got more persons, places and things than a noun
Gotta get mine, can't let these thug niggas send me above
I'm the King of Kings, you the Queens of Queens, mad love

[samples of Curtis Mayfield's "Gimme Your Love"]
Gimme Ya Luv, Gimme Ya Luv

[Half A Mill]
We can travel thru worlds, have a few boys, have a few girls
You push ya paint Lex baby, cease wearin 5th Avenue pearls
Livin life like a trillionaire, Egyptian fragrant scrub ya rear
Love ya hair, waist thicker than rugby wear
Queen original, picture me in your visual
As the only individual, you'll ever listen to you
Your Nefetiti appearance can't get no cleaner
You the bomb baby, other bitches is Hiroshima
Take a sip of wine or two, it's my sub-race combinin you
When Earth is my surface, oceans deeper than chronicles
I got a wand for you, applyin forces honor you
You said I'm your boo, and my wand is wonderful
We gotta get mine, can't let these drug niggas send me above
I'm the King of Kings, you the Queens of Queens, mad love

[more samples of Curtis Mayfield's "Gimme Your Love"]
Gimme Ya Luv, Gimme Ya Luv

[Half A Mill]
I'm royal, so let my seed soak in your soil
Let me open this for you, got the coconut oil
Divine I C King got you spoiled
3/4's of water that covers your surface, boils
I got preservers in them coils
My aliant from Zion, sexy tiger from Niger
Sayin Half, I wanna ride ya, full length up inside ya
Multiply like Ilijah, got you drippin saliva
40 Thieves between ya knees, gettin hit with the Bible
Get on or can get the knife, cuz you be splittin tomorrow
Wedding Gown on Greyhound, wit a hidden revolver
Ya body consist of matter, girl, and I'm the resolver
The rise of sun, got you on your knees, sayin "Please father" word up

[more samples of Curtis Mayfield's "Gimme Your Love"]
Gimme Ya Luv, Gimme Ya Luv[Intro: Half-A-Mill]
Uh yea, yo, dedicate this one
To all my dawgs and all my chicks that came
Up in the struggle, yaknawmean?
In the hole, in the ghetto, poverty, yaknawmean?
Word!, broken homes, no moms, no pops
Abusive step-parents, ya'mean?, foster parents, go on

**Quintay Soul singing in the background througout the whole song**
**Go On**

[Verse 1]
I remember my younger years, lil snotty nose nigga
Peasy head whip behind the ears
My grandma placed Stevey Wonder and drunk Colt 45 beers
Cause my moms out she was neva there
Grandma sell all she did was run the streets
Shootin up drugs, what 'bout our two sons that had to eat
What 'bout my father?, he ain't' wanna be bothered
Too busy 'nortin off heroin, use to take me up to Yonkers
And stick niggas up while I was wit 'em
Then come back to Harlem, buyin grams of boy
He was sniffin, leanin back his nose drippin
One day he was so high -- he forgot I was wit 'em
I was 5 when he left me in the streets
On the hump, 45th and Lennox
Imagine that, he was weak, but his son was stronger
I took the A-train to Brooklyn
First thing a lil nigga did was call Grandma
And told her what happened, she was mad as hell
Said "when she saw that motherfucker she was gonna stab 'em"
If it wasn't for Grandma Duke where will I be at?
Another dead kid in the alley eatin by street rats
Grandma was so strong told me to be stronger
Said "don't slow down for nuttin or no one just move on son
You'll livin in the world of wrong son
One day you'll be older and understand but for now just Go On son"

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**
Go On -- live your life, follow your dreams
One day your gonna see the light
Go On -- young man follow your plans
Put this whole wide world in your palm of your hands

[Verse 2]
I'm from a broken home, everybody was broken home
I've been to projects black and white tv's, no phones
We use hangers for antennas, been through cold as winters
Kool-Aid and cheese sandwich for dinner, and school days was iller
I had one shoe lace in my Playboys I got off Medicaid for realer
While other kids played wit toys, I was tryin play to get paid
To change the life for this lil boy
Growin up for hard times it became part of my mind
I was tryin to see money, I was partially blind
But at times I became focused, from adolescence in teen
Cursed from birth, now I'm blessed wit cream
Hustler gettin stressed by fiends
They say my boy stronger then Meth
Dunn I play the corner wit tec's
Nobody gave it to me, I had to take my respect
Shootout couple of doors, rob a couple of stores
Keep five bundles in my draws
I'm tryin to sling mine, how you gonna sling yours
Your goin to war, for rich or poor
Gats spit for bricks of that raw, quick on the draw
So long you hittin the floor, I'mma Go On

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**

[Verse 3]
The streets is callin a nigga
They tried to drop a ball on a nigga
Seems like this world is too small for a nigga
Came from a shortage of figures
Now every thought is a figures
Step in my shoes you'll prolly walk a bit quicker
I'm from quartz of malt liquor
Street corners thats sicker
Basketball courts, ghetto sports figures
Dogs that'll stick ya, brawls that'll trick ya
This world is trife, its life I see it all through the pictures
All through the scriptures
Blood n crips, thug love hugs and kisses
In a instance you'll get mugged for riches
Tucked in the ditches
Layed in the dirt mud in your britches
Sumthin religious, sumthin suspicious, 100 of stitches
Its a cold world, you stuck in the Blizzard?
Went from Chuckers to Lizard
Gators to exquisites, major digits
Go On -- son handle your business
Scrabblin flippin, life is a gamble
I got my hand on my winners, I'm goin on

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 4X**[Intro: Nature (Half-A-Mill)]
Yea, (uh huh) -- puff puff
We 'bout to do is -- puff puff

What you should do is -- puff puff
This one goes out to everybody out there
Within the sound of my voice that gets high
(we'll mix it up like this, knawmean?)
Nature -- Half-A-Mill -- puff puff
(use that badboy, philly, dutch, backwood it all good)
It don't matter what you use --- puff puff, Half-A-Mill

[Half-A-Mill]
Mill Gates low calico, rollin that Cali dro
Roll wit the baddest ho, roll in that snow
Fold in that dough, playa you know my status quo
Gallons of 'mo, packed purple haze in the dutch
And I ain't passion to yo
Got cash in the stash money like fuck, but ain't flashin to yo
Benz buggy truck kidded up, no room for passenger
Bro "how the hell you gonna be a pimp and ain't a whip"?
Bitches gonna laugh at you
You I hit switches, switch sixes, big spliffs ridiculous
Officilous, nakedlious, chicks rub tits and lips and clit to this

[Hook: Nature (Half-A-Mill)] **repeat 5X
24/7 --- puff puff (puffin on some Izzerb)

[Half-A-Mill]
While you day dreamin, I stay schemin
On your girls face I spray semen
Make her sip syrup cause she earl-up
I'mma still fuck her til she curle up
And when my nut purle up
I gotta block chocolate twirl up
Smoke the whole world up
Word up its murder
How we keep that ganja to burn up
If you like chronic, I mean chronic rewinders turn it up
We got pounds, clowns downs, cock suckers your turn is up
The Firm is up, Sopranos all we do is handle
Scrambble and gamble, roll out bamble
So high, Sosa holla out hola, wait I'm in cancun

[Hook: Nature (Half-A-Mill)] **repeat 5X
24/7 --- puff puff (puffin on some Izzerb)

It goes here, your half, what!

[Nature]
Ayo its that shit when you hear in the whip
Your goin to be bumpin yo, dimes, dubs, 50's of dro
Fuck that yo I'm dumpin yo
All day long all to the head, naw I might let one nigga know
Cause thirsty niggas be bringin they friends
Like please "can my dunn hit it yo"?
They call me anti-socialable, I done coached a few
Made poacher moves, see me when I got a show to do
Back stage pickin wit ho to screw
Show to improve or showin off
I hear 'em pistols goin off
No insurance on my whip
I crash like I don't know the cost
Laughin then I leave it there
Leave the place, leave the tapes
Take the guns from under the seats
Cause niggas know, I don't need the case
I ain't the one to be laughin at or laughin wit
I'm action packed, catch me where the cashs at
Or any smoke shops after that

[Hook: Nature (Half-A-Mill)] **repeat 9X

[Verse 1]
I seen it all from robberies to extortion and shit
I seen family business get tossed to a place
Mafioso kiss, Gotti jr. put a rolli on my wrist
Satir day ridge told me Tony owe me this
Peep the Brooklyn gangsta
Where I'm from niggas'll pump 21 in ya
They got orders to replace ya
Ain't no loyalty in these streets
Especially when niggas givin up 20 G's for your wig piece
My heart neva skip a beat, street hotter than fish grease
Still a nigga pitchin 'em ki's, switichin 'em V's
Gun stay cocked don't hesitate to squeeze
I'm real Vendetta 'cated y'all niggas make believes
Playa haters, 2003, dunn still spankin 'em Gators
Trench mink, waves is plus, we armed dangerous
Niggas can't bang wit us
Your next in the news, you still can't hang wit us

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**
Milliato -- lives to ride another day
That's what I heard 'em say

**Talkin in the background**
Yea, from the projects, all through the streets
Hood to hood, yea, OT to OC, Milliato

[Verse 2]
Uh, we been there done that and still doin it
Smack Boheemians I want six on the first, two on the fifth
Catch me in the hood Indian spliff
Rock silk Polo crowns like a low life
Filthy chips, I use to go clothes up the back
Now I go up to Hack-a-sack
Deep in the woods where the crackers at
Ya'll plan to take back New York, we want half of that
Been in this since the '20's
In 1941 Grandpa Lou Henry copped two Bentley's
Taught Italians the rules of the city
Dunn I move swoofly, in this world niggas loose Kidney's
Livers and Lungs, get hundereds like the Kennedy's
I'm on some Big Pun shit, ride for my family eat well
Ya'll crab motherfuckers don't get nuthin kid
We livin well while y'all rottin in the slum and shit
Yo I'm on some other shit, I can bring Hummer shit

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**

**Talkin in the background**
Yea, soul survivor, uh, came from the dirt
And made it worst, uh ya know, yea
The robberies, stick-ups, stick-up kids

[Verse 3]
My coast is nostra, niggas sniff Coke til they nose dry
Sit wit punk can't even open they eyes
Notice the ties, illest cats that drovin the five
Guerilla skin hat, coat to match, roll wit the wise
Open the wine from Spain smoke haze of all kinds
Remember the broke days no Coke ain't a sling
No shine, but those the older days
Nowadays its the Rover days
Stress 600 Benz wit Shover days
Six will ends, goin to hell livin since
And if L give me another chance I'm livin again
Winnin again, platinum teeth grinnin again
360 ways spin, life is no beginnin or end
I spin to win, Cuban Cigars littin the bend
Shootin through heart, the God took the spirit of man
These words are harsh, you prolly won't hear 'em again
Words on the street is the niggas done did it again

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 4X**

**Talkin in the background**
Uh, yea, word, Desperado style
Uh huh, from the survivor, yea what!
Livin the prophet days, yea, uh huh y'all know

Yea, uh huh, y'all know, uh, welcome to the sunset[Chorus]
All we do is get money and get real high
Push Benzes and 85 I's
New World Order, got ya ready to run and hide
New Millennium, we will survive
All we do is get money and get real high
Push Ranges and Benz Buggy I's
New World Order, got ya ready to run and hide
New Millennium, we will survive

[Half-A-Mill]
I see you stupid 'dro, still my brain cells never move slow
Toke calico, deep throat the baddest hoes
Niggas know my status quote, artistic
I draw a biscuit, unlike Michaelangelo, I'm the Noah of this thug shit
Flooded, everyday's another bucket get
I can't front, I love this shit
You missed the lies, now we push S5's on some other shit
Blowin another clip, some say they waitin for the mothership
I ain't debatin, cuz in heaven or hell, I tell God, I tell Satan
I'm all about money makin, on my job like a hundred Jamaicans
Runnin wit kingpins, who you gon rob
I send a squad to kill ya squad
Fuck ya thinkin, Firm niggas push Cadillac Jeeps
Navigator Lincoln's
Global caught on my Motorola Mobile
Off the hook books like Barnes & Nobles
Street astroligist, heat communist, complete logic is
I got one goal, to put goal on the streets, where the projects is
We too strong to die, that's why we gotta live
Platinum doubt in the hottest whips

[Chorus]

[Half-A-Mill]
Mill Gates, better come somethin, droppin somethin
Catch me in the chopper stuntin
I'm a Yankee but Jamaican cook me esquire fish and hot dumplings
I rock ya Lennon suits with rocks
On the cufflinks, lie iller you
Curdiest Beck's, 850 I's, silver proof, imagine that
I used to sling crills for loot
Now I'm openin my money store like Phil Rezoot
Keep it here, dope from get money whores
Thought he enter the drawers
Lois Lane platinum chain, stretch range at the Source Awards
Awesome broads they carry proem and sawed-off
One shot'll take the whole top of your Honda Accord off
You small dog, you all lost
No wins, you fall off, and get hauled off in the trunk of my Benz
I smoke skunk, purple haze, twist it up
Mixed it up, hit the clutch, switched it up

[Chorus]

[Half-A-Mill]
I smoke purple haze and spit phlegm
Big Benz, forty inch rims, New York niggas got shit locked again
When the Glocks pop, niggas need oxygen
Don't let me catch you slingin rocks on these blocks again
I got plots, I'm out to get a hundred thou time ten
You know my style dunn, I run with foul wild men
With public housin, up north, we be thuggin in the mountain
Out in the world, we guzzle Henny straight and no earl
Hustle weight, stab a half a cake on your girl, skatin thru states
Jets raidin the place, TV's screen big, DVD playin Scarface
Son, I'm God face, hard face
Smash you in the chest wit a sledgehammer till ya heart break
Wild out, my calico pop rounds out, my shots knock towns out
My whole block'll run up in your town house
I'm like so shocked, key the coke like Sosa
Pushin ski boat wit a chauffeur
Up the Hudson River, I got tons of guns and ones are split up
Niggas front, I got to fuck ya shit up

[Chorus 2X]Uh, Half-A-Mill, Brooklyn
Yea, New York city, Manhattan, Queens

Where we from son?

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
We from New York City, New York City
Grimey, thug gritty, New York City
I'm from New York City, New York City
We get money, we get busy, we get paid in New York City

[Verse 1]
Yo in the streets of New York
Dope fiends are leanin for more fiends
TV screen follow homoicide scene
I drive you to Queens, S-5 wit hot beems
Divide Queen wit my team forever our scheme is not a dream
Its all real, they saw Mill he walk wit still
Quick on draw 4-4 put a limp in your grill
Your temperature chill, ain't nuttin for your wig to peal
Took a hit when shit gets real, cause niggas get killed
Cooked up a half-a-ki creals, niggas runnin up on yo family wit steel
And cause more horror then "Ammitville"
Hang granny up side down, shots rang from the pound, ill
You better any up 'em bills, cause blood spill for 'em bucks
Where I'm from for real, big guns put you on the run
Where I'm from is real
Niggas want mills and more steel, 20 inch on the four wheel
Turn your front to a war field, for real

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]

Some niggas blood some niggas crip
21 slugs I'm spittin it
Sittin on bricks gettin yayo gettin it
Niggas got nose drips and sniff it
Niggas got more chips then the lil bit
We markin and distribute it
Mass production, that way you get a quick
Fiends get sick, vomit and shit when they can't get a hit
Nigga drop dead right on the strip
Ole D of herion, he was an old G
Shot medicine in his arms
Ghetto sins Brook-lon to cheddar on amp
Til a nigga fear chest wit ten, and pressure bends
Make you run over pedestrians
Ain't no snitchin or confessions
Its like the west we in
The foul flesh we in, we rep again
Lead tech off and dead your man, we represent
NYC dawg its dedtriment
Hoodlum put guns on your tongue and click
Hung your clique, dunn now from cents

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]

Uh, I'm from borough that's thorough
Lil niggas pushin CL-6's
Best payin female to the pitchers
Went from rags to riches
Jags wit the bags in engine
And I still wear a mask for a half-a-million
Yea we know you got the stash in the ceiling
And we live from New York
Where every night another apple is pealin
Major cookouts, smash and grillin
Pour ash through your pj's
Try to get back to your building
We on your hallway wit masked out
You don't want me to get at your children
Now get that cash or you gonna miss 'em
I'm like the Marshall when I cause the Vision
And I ain't tryin get stabbed the burn
Smash instil the gats is gonna burn
Cats goin to learn, New York is actioned packed
Even Clinton moved to Harlem for sacks and black
Blazin in his Cadillac, welcome to the concrete jungle
Were you when or citizen, til the police mind beat upon you

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]

[Outro: Half-A-Mill]
Half-A-Mill, Brooklyn, NYC, representin
Yea, uh ya heard, five borough, yea uh

Uh woke in the mornin hoped out the water bed kissed my boo
See I'm known to shake their ass like Mystcal
If maggot was a school I'll be principal
There be no more boarder Ed just broader head
Pushin Ford Humvey, got hoes all cross the country
Don't get it confused I'm gangsta, dunn my guns squeeze
My gators cost too much run from D's, cranberry and yellow
The illest nigga since Rockafello
The realest nigga since 'Pac, straight off Death Row
17 Karats on my left toe, bitches grab on and can't let go
I understand that's your wife dawg but thats my best ho
Nigga hello, drop bow's on 'em and lose your elbow
Chanelle flow straight paper, been to more places than Melrose
Peep the view, call your hoes when I'm rollin through
Cuz I might whisper in her ear, Only You

***In my world, Only You, things I do for a love

Uh, what?, Only You, knawmean baby?

Brand new ride, trench coat made out of Camel hi

One love to Biggie Smalls, Illmatic, Guerilla action

Broads want me cuz I break 'em hoes
Take good girls and make them hoes
Ass naked in the Range Rover

And head for bank roll

Born hustler fuck wit me, son you just a customer

***In my world, Only You, things I do for a love

Lobster and Shrimp my son'll tell you pots or pans?
And I'm still street, make thugs hop the fence
When I'm lettin off your fiance will call the wedding off
How she gonna marry a nigga -- when his head is off?
I rock Maury Gotors suits playa you in terry cluafs
I'm the bomb ask your mom, I drive some cherry's off
I spit game, my words is wisdom, they got sherry's lost
Went from sherry's to pour, braddy to abroad
I know your shit is hot but dawg I got a deadly assault
Urban Kelly main Virgin Mary berry or cross?, Religion
Ill coupe dawg, just for pigeons, bullet proof engine
Lay back the roof is missin
And everytime I smile my tooth is gleasin
Get money like the Rasta child
Too smooth to get high style, just watch out
Only You girl that's what I'm 'bout, watch out
Only You girl that's what I'm 'bout

***In my world, Only You, I'mma do for a love
