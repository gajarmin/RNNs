Verse One: Hurricane G, Redman

The Hurricane G is the ultimate funk, pop the trunk
(Hoo-hah!! Wild like Shaolin monks)
Representin', comin' out of Brooklyn, Flatbush
You wuss, you can't push push in the bush

Well uh, let's take a journey to hell and beyond
Where the bomb grows on palms, and bags labeled Cheech and Chong
The Jimi Hendrix of rap, I got an afro and
Bandana, then I rock jams like Santana
I move MC's like niggas move keys uptown
Red and Hurricane G, SO HOW YOU LIKE US NOW?!!?!

Chorus: repeat 4X

[KRS] Watch out! We run New York
Yeah

Verse Two: Hurricane G

(Hurricane G hit em one time)
From the Brook, taught how to trick by the real gangsta crooks
So I hook back what you took!
I take my funk and my religion serious
Sanctify y'all and leave y'all house niggas delirious
(hahahahaa) cause I'm furious!
How dare you motherFUCKERS, forget about the ultimate
Funk, BITTTTTCH nigga!
I got your wicked witch with a switch
Motherfucker, fuck you and your crew!
So what nigga, is it you wanna do?
In ninety-fo' I kick the wicked for the bitches
For the real trick deez who can dig it
Cause after pop thought all that, Hurricane stay fat
Word to my big dick boriquas in the back
The queen of the East coast, funk gangsta pack buddha
On the rhyme since eighty-nine
It's all in your mind, but what's yours is mines
Your dough and your hoes Bump N Grind to my rhymes
Now! It ain't a nigga who could hang
Or pop yang, about a motherfuckin th-a-a-a-ang
And uh, fuck any bitch who can't hang
I'm representin bitches universal!
It go, one for the biz, on the bizness
Which y'all blesses with God's blessings, do you see?
Hurricane and Redman original steel
Latin Queens in the house!!
So nigga swing it over here on these big fat tits!!
(Titties, hahahahahaa)

Verse Three: Redman

The Funk Doctor Spock, blast up on your block
I'm walkin through the sewer with manure on my socks
Your style, I freaked it when I was a child
So you talkin that baby talk like, Who's Talkin Now?
Verbally I crush, brains erupt
Blow your focus, like you sniffin angel dust
Run of the mill I'm not, watch me kill a cock-sucker
And cause ruckus, like them L.O.D. motherfuckers
Every verse every word I preach
Represents the East, long as the human eyes can see
Gimme that funk funk funk funk funk funk funk funk beat!
I light a blunt for niggas up in Sing-Sing
I do it to death, style is funk that's fresh
Remove your vest, you just won the wet t-shirt contest
And I'm hotter, than the Globetrotters in the Bahamas
I got a pair of pajamas made out of ganjah and almonds
Eager, as a nigga wantin my shit to dub
Cause my shit be BANGIN like the Crips and Bloods
Troop, I flew the coop like Big Bird in Timb boots
I Skywalk the planet like my code name was Luke
From the darkside, I'm from the darkside Pah
I'm Above the Law like Steven Seagal
Motherfucker!!

Outro: Dr. Trevis

[KRS] Watch out!
Hahahaha, we take you to the darkside

[Tony Touch]
It's Tony Toca, the one that's got you screamin "Esta loca"
Dale huevo Is my mic Leggo my Eggo
Spanish Harlem all the way to san diego
Make it happen
You know, like movin yayo
I set my product, that shit's far from the palace
Mantequilla not manteca o sin semilla
Cocoa brovaz, hurricane, mira mira
Ton touch sound doofy eatin fajitas
Chillin in the b-boy stance
In my Adidas
While señoritas be screaming Buenos Dias
Rock steady by now you know the steelo
Mi correo still gets down on the leelo
Soy taino indians welcome to my tipi
Pop in the CD and let's get freaky
Melaza, Guatauba en la casa
Boricua, about to pass it off to the rasta

[Tek]
It's the el generalno
Tell your baqua where's the hydro
If the chocolito make my eyes low
BC a tomb bab with me and my man
Trying to double our ends with the el capitan
(speaking Spanish)
(speaking Spanish)
Undressin me, thinking about sexin me
Wanna matarme a mí?

[Steele]
Blazing, kicking lingo with this bingo
Who got hot making the pesos out in santo domingo
El socio, used to go to the Acapulco
Every weekend tricking on chulas, he was beatin
But on the streets of harlem around the grand concourse
He had to force a loco, with amigos he used to boss
A dios mios, just like el niños
El corazón de el está frío
Y puro coro perico

Chorus: [Tek, (Steele)]
Harlem got the pace in it (boogie, boogie got the cake in it)
Crooklyn keeps on takin it (queens cats been making it)

[Tek]
I do this for my soldiers in the streets
Who stand toast to toast with the cousin asleep
Making illegal transactions
World-wide connections
Forced up a change like the name smif-n-wessun
See me coming through and my nigga clef too
Or the 650 blowing up the Grant's Tomb
Mobb beats to protect slaying your street bite
Like a killing, over-dealing for the pearly white

[Hurricane G]
Blowin' down your mother fucking roof
It be hurricane g, subwoofin out ya ass
From first staff, up through parks from the heart
Representando! and my niggas up in spanish harlem
Who don't give a fuck and my box stuck cutting up tribal
So get the hydro, cause we gonna keep it live all night yo
Yeah one love to my fam in boricua land
My hermanitos sparking up trees
112 buddah keys barking up puerto rican crib
Smacking all rice and beans
And you know my hermanitas keep it real
In timboso high hills
All my pitycitas who ain't fucking around
Santeras holdin shit down for the crown
Tony touch, cocoa brovaz and i
Keep the barrio high
No doubt
If he CPR in the mother fucking house
I'm talking about crazy puerto ricans
Who beefing
A few heads is busted because I see them leaking
Freaking, because I be frying bitches up like hoochie fritos
For my "papi chulitos"
Yo, yeah word up and if you can't get wit it then kiss my culito
But you, on thea real I wanna say one love and rest in peace

You kept walking shugah, yo I started catchin up
Peeping game now I'm the nigga that you smashin up

Prince Poetry:

Damn sis, you lookin kinda, extra
Diggin your cat strut and your beautiful cocoa carribean texture
Savin all the small talk lecture, for chump light
You know deep inside I wanna sex you like no other
Chasin you down Jamaica Ave
A ghetto dope Cleopatra, nigga shorty was bad
First she was iggin me son, sliding up in strawberries
Suckin down a sugar cone with nuts, sprinkles and cherries
Excuse me miss, but-uhh pecan
Can I get a lick?
I be the Prince Po, the rebirth of slick
So its cool like that
Me and you can make it all that, four flat
Into this elevator exotic world with the tall black
Ghetto dope Don Juan ready to see reflections in Amazon rivers with ya blue
Watters
Matchin straw hat, see the picture
Love it but it ain't perfect
We can exchange this data and later respectfully work it
Wheew!
I'm nothin but a space aged freak who wanna beam you up later this week
So baby whats the word

Shugah Shorty why you backin up, got a nigga out here iggy actin up

Pharoahe Monch:

Damn, it's like
Uhh,uhh, a feeling that I get inside
Hard to explain it , I'm getting tongue tied like
I hate when I wheez, stublin over the words
Mumblin, fumblin over my opening line
Jumblin rhymes together, you know my palms get all sweaty
And I uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh!
Misses, I can't explain how much I want to be up in it
And I know you ain't had no dick in a minute
Oh, you smoke beedies, see you go
Couldn't you see me and you stressed out in bikini's on the beach in Tahiti?
See me I'm very selective even though I could be greedy
My main objective is to write our names together in graffiti
And are be (?) so y'all can see me, speedy
(naw see)
You can be my centipede like we-be-fore-play
Cause I gourmet my food up like eatie and Maxwell
Similar to that smooth kid's C-D
Monch, easily the most measily unmistakable
Believe me

Chorus

Pharoahe Monch:

This one little chick she pissed me off
Comin out the store, now I'm holdin the door
To the Bodega, she got a little man with her
Figuring if I kicks it to the kid then I could get her right
Say listen
I see you around every night around seven o'clock
You walkin up the block (?) with the rocks on the side of the crib
With your kid on ya hip and ya close top notch
You know the thirst baby
First we can deal with the math if you search through your purse for a pen
We can blast off
Like Hubble Space Craft material
I'm aware of you and your concern about vanirial diseases
If it pleases you, shit, Jesus
I pack profolactics that stretch to my knees
She squinted, with a demented look behind a tented glass of a girlfriend
Rented, Benz E-Class vented hate
But still hinted like I was self centered
She said speak to the hand
Y'all know that shit that girls invented
Aww, see it didn't have to be be like that wit you fiberglass
Backboard ass that's mad flat bitch

Shugah Shorty why you backin up, got a nigga out here iggy actin up

Hurricane G:

Who that big flat piece of chocolate
Sparkin it, rockin it, "uhh, uhh-uhh," rockin it

Prince Poetry:

My name is Prince, boo
Now few who speak don't be true
But you, you got this lovely but rugged stiggy
How you do?
Get out the car, lemmie see you
Now what's your name?

Hurricane G: "Star"

Prince Poetry:

Body was bizarre, yo Star, where you live?

Hurricane G:

Far
Rockaway Beach out in the boons
My niggas put five on it and stack all I like the Loons
Packin twos
So Pappi what you say?

Prince Poetry:

When I'm grown I don't hump, I bone
I ain't playin
I'm a man who likes a treat
Message feet of the independent Queen
To throw up some heat
Shit girl I can fix you something to eat
Prepare a five course meal while I'm makin the beat
Already got two things in this beautiful universal common
That's lovin a tight ass fuck, and some tight ass rymin
So what
We into somethin or your frontin, pilgrum
I ain't askin a protif be for make children
I'm skilled in body messages and sexual healin
I'm gentle, but I'm runnin wild just to make a million
We buildin baby
So here's enough for you to handle
That'll light you up and blow you out like candles

Chorus[Produced by Omen]

...1, 2, 3, YO!

[Redman, (Hurricane G)]

Kicked in the door then I yell, "Don't move!"
C.O's is like, "Yo, who the fuck is this dude?"
I'll give you a little hint, it's the Soopaman Luva
Took the shotgun from him, then I shot that fucker
Threw it to Hurricane, she like (Yeah! Let's do it!)
Snatched up the reporter that was here to interview her
Raised up one of his hands, put a bullet through it
Took off his Franck Muller
So daily news knew the time it took to rescue her
We going out the front door
Hurricane, shotgun, hand letting the pump off
Bitches see it and started wildin' in the mess hall
(Fuck the warden, we gon' get you, muh'fucka!)

Yo, I told you I was coming
(Nigga, I ain't never scared
I ain't giving no state time for shit I ain't did
Gimme some more ammo, the front door's near
We're two barrels smokin')
With a hostage in here
Yo, G, you lock and load?
(Lock and load)
Plan came together like the Eleven and Bellagio
We out the front door
Warden, shotty blow
I mash the gas, to me and G, its "Adios!"

That's how that Soopaman Luva get down
(Yeah, that's how that bitch Hurricane get down)

Hey yo Puff, check this out pa

Throw your guns in the air
Socialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way
Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see
But you wanna be  you ain't shit to me
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me
Playa, my real dogs  they'll spit for me
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart
I've seen em come and I've seen em part
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?
Front from the light catch shots after dark
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these
On the spot, red dots make em all believe
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these
See I do the things that they can't achieve
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
More hotter than the sun
I'm living on the run
Because i'm public enemy number one


Chorus:

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

[Puff Daddy]
Let me ask you, what you got against me?
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?
Is it my house or maybe its all three
I just came up and you're all against me
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun
Cause they got me public enemy number one

Chorus

[Puff Daddy]
All you suckers, liars, court testifiers
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dimes sweating
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: "Do not cry"
You know that i'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
Because i'm public enemy number one

Chorus

[Hurricane G]
Yeah yeah, that's right Puff
That's what I'm talkin about love
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down
But fuck dat, they just mad
Cause you got all the ladies
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys
You know? and thats just the way the story goes
And thats just the way the story goes
Fuck you niggas and hoes

Chillin in the b-boy stance
In my Adidas
While señoritas be screaming Buenos Dias
Rock steady by now you know the steelo
Mi correo still gets down on the leelo
Soy taino indians welcome to my tipi
Pop in the CD and let's get freaky
Melaza, Guatauba en la casa
Boricua, about to pass it off to the rasta

[Tek]
It's the el generalno
Tell your baqua where's the hydro
If the chocolito make my eyes low
BC a tomb bab with me and my man
Trying to double our ends with the el capitan
(speaking Spanish)
(speaking Spanish)
Undressin me, thinking about sexin me
Wanna matarme a mí?

[Steele]
Blazing, kicking lingo with this bingo
Who got hot making the pesos out in santo domingo
El socio, used to go to the Acapulco
Every weekend tricking on chulas, he was beatin
But on the streets of harlem around the grand concourse
He had to force a loco, with amigos he used to boss
A dios mios, just like el niños
El corazón de el está frío
Y puro coro perico

Chorus: [Tek, (Steele)]
Harlem got the pace in it (boogie, boogie got the cake in it)
Crooklyn keeps on takin it (queens cats been making it)

[Tek]
I do this for my soldiers in the streets
Who stand toast to toast with the cousin asleep
Making illegal transactions
World-wide connections
Forced up a change like the name smif-n-wessun
See me coming through and my nigga clef too
Or the 650 blowing up the Grant's Tomb
Mobb beats to protect slaying your street bite
Like a killing, over-dealing for the pearly white

[Hurricane G]
Blowin' down your mother fucking roof
It be hurricane g, subwoofin out ya ass
From first staff, up through parks from the heart
Representando! and my niggas up in spanish harlem
Who don't give a fuck and my box stuck cutting up tribal
So get the hydro, cause we gonna keep it live all night yo
Yeah one love to my fam in boricua land
My hermanitos sparking up trees
112 buddah keys barking up puerto rican crib
Smacking all rice and beans
And you know my hermanitas keep it real
In timboso high hills
All my pitycitas who ain't fucking around
Santeras holdin shit down for the crown
Tony touch, cocoa brovaz and i
Keep the barrio high
No doubt
If he CPR in the mother fucking house
I'm talking about crazy puerto ricans
Who beefing
A few heads is busted because I see them leaking
Freaking, because I be frying bitches up like hoochie fritos
For my "papi chulitos"
Yo, yeah word up and if you can't get wit it then kiss my culito
But you, on thea real I wanna say one love and rest in peace
To my nigga Bridge from 112
Big up Johnson Projects
Jefferson in the house

Word up one love to the barrio, cocoa brovaz, tony touch and hurricane g
Peace de corazón papi

Verse One: Hurricane G, Redman

The Hurricane G is the ultimate funk, pop the trunk
(Hoo-hah!! Wild like Shaolin monks)
Representin', comin' out of Brooklyn, Flatbush
You wuss, you can't push push in the bush

Well uh, let's take a journey to hell and beyond
Where the bomb grows on palms, and bags labeled Cheech and Chong

Chorus: repeat 4X

[KRS] Watch out! We run New York

How dare you motherFUCKERS, forget about the ultimate
Funk, BITTTTTCH nigga!
I got your wicked witch with a switch
Motherfucker, fuck you and your crew!
So what nigga, is it you wanna do?

Word to my big dick boriquas in the back
The queen of the East coast, funk gangsta pack buddha
On the rhyme since eighty-nine
It's all in your mind, but what's yours is mines
Your dough and your hoes Bump N Grind to my rhymes

Or pop yang, about a motherfuckin th-a-a-a-ang
And uh, fuck any bitch who can't hang

(Titties, hahahahahaa)

Verse Three: Redman

The Funk Doctor Spock, blast up on your block
I'm walkin through the sewer with manure on my socks
Your style, I freaked it when I was a child
So you talkin that baby talk like, Who's Talkin Now?
Verbally I crush, brains erupt
Blow your focus, like you sniffin angel dust
Run of the mill I'm not, watch me kill a cock-sucker
And cause ruckus, like them L.O.D. motherfuckers
Every verse every word I preach
Represents the East, long as the human eyes can see
Gimme that funk funk funk funk funk funk funk funk beat!
I light a blunt for niggas up in Sing-Sing
I do it to death, style is funk that's fresh
Remove your vest, you just won the wet t-shirt contest
And I'm hotter, than the Globetrotters in the Bahamas
I got a pair of pajamas made out of ganjah and almonds
Eager, as a nigga wantin my shit to dub
Cause my shit be BANGIN like the Crips and Bloods
Troop, I flew the coop like Big Bird in Timb boots
I Skywalk the planet like my code name was Luke
From the darkside, I'm from the darkside Pah

Hook[Hurricane G]
Aiyyo son, you have the right to remain silent
Even though you ain't did NOTHIN violent
So Hurricane G spit this, rip this
Straight out the poorest congressional district
The Bronx baby, shit is crazy!
I see my niggas get harassed daily
183rd you heard, got it locked
But shit is hot, we got choppers on the spot
Watched off rooftops, from WAY up the block
My niggas be like, "FUCK the cops!"
And face the consequences
Risk bein beat, killed, and arrested
Sentenced, forced to live between wire fences
It's a FUCKED UP AGENDA
Whether cop a plea or surrender
If you'se a three time drug offender
You goin DOWN son
For way less than a POUND son
The government got no love, twenty-five thousand niggas
In New York in jail for drugs
And three million in the streets is thugs
What, the, FUCK?!

[?]
Aiyyo I drop gems sporadic, it ain't democratic
My demographic, ain't tryin to feel no type of static
But still can't escape from Jake
From one-six-eight, to over the bridge, outta state
It's hate, tryin to relate, the violation
Annihilation, on all different type of nation
Word life, it's like the third reich, you heard right
Pulled me over on the turnpike, plus my birthright thwarted
By the government supported
Court ordered, good lawyer?  I can't afford it
Sound distorted, I don't be where the wealthy be
So they got a cell for me and act unhealthily
But I got somethin that they all should check
N.Y.C., P.N.P., up on your set

	"Blowin down your motherfuckin roof.."
You watch us, we watch you
You stop us, we stop you
[G]	You goin DOWN son!
We watch you.. we stop you..
[G]	DOWN son!  For way less than a POUND son!

[Hurricane G]
Shit!  Seven hundred million tax dollars a year
To keep drug dealers in prison
While the rapists and the killers is livin
Deep in the streets chillin, shit is real!
Niggas rape little girls for a thrill
And the rest kill for a MEAL
While fifty percent of women in prison, is on death row
But that shit is on the low, for murderin a spouse
Or lover, abusive motherfuckers!
It don't make no sense!
Why, the women go down over self-defense
And spend, seventeen hours a day
In the cell, a.k.a., a living hell
With low level standards, fuckin BASTARDS
Got me devestated and offended
For wrongfully mistreatin females who pregnant
Who can't exercise the rights of first amendment
All my peoples stop pretendin
And get yours to the endin!

[?]
Aiyyo, peep statistics, we official in the districts
Sadistic, tryin to keep the black fist twisted
Find the flaw, shinin scars behind iron bars
Crime laws not designed to fight no kind of wars
Let it sink in (they send you) straight to Sing-Sing
(Doors are kicked in) kingpins flee to Kingston
Life in exile, projectile for the reptile
Cruel machines use human beings as a textile
For the darkest race, there's no escape
From the marketplace, no grace if you caught a case
It interest me, how one of the most watched indices
Of economic growth is prison industries
If Gods ain't locked, no jobs for cops
If blocks ain't hot, stock options drop
From Boston to Brooklyn, my heads is gettin tooken
I win when the crooks win (WE OUT) bring the hook in

	"Blowin down your motherfuckin roof.."
	"Blowin down your motherfuckin roof.."
We stop you..[Hurricane G]

Brillando en la luz

So celosos que son un poquito malo
Quieren guerra, pues toman un guerra maricon

You kept walking shugah, yo I started catchin up
Peeping game now I'm the nigga that you smashin up

Prince Poetry:

Damn sis, you lookin kinda, extra
Diggin your cat strut and your beautiful cocoa carribean texture
Savin all the small talk lecture, for chump light
You know deep inside I wanna sex you like no other
Chasin you down Jamaica Ave
A ghetto dope Cleopatra, nigga shorty was bad
First she was iggin me son, sliding up in strawberries
Suckin down a sugar cone with nuts, sprinkles and cherries
Excuse me miss, but-uhh pecan
Can I get a lick?
I be the Prince Po, the rebirth of slick
So its cool like that
Me and you can make it all that, four flat
Into this elevator exotic world with the tall black
Ghetto dope Don Juan ready to see reflections in Amazon rivers with ya blue
Watters
Matchin straw hat, see the picture
Love it but it ain't perfect
We can exchange this data and later respectfully work it
Wheew!
I'm nothin but a space aged freak who wanna beam you up later this week
So baby whats the word

Shugah Shorty why you backin up, got a nigga out here iggy actin up

Pharoahe Monch:

Damn, it's like
Uhh,uhh, a feeling that I get inside
Hard to explain it , I'm getting tongue tied like
I hate when I wheez, stublin over the words
Mumblin, fumblin over my opening line
Jumblin rhymes together, you know my palms get all sweaty
And I uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh!
Misses, I can't explain how much I want to be up in it
And I know you ain't had no dick in a minute
Oh, you smoke beedies, see you go
Couldn't you see me and you stressed out in bikini's on the beach in Tahiti?
See me I'm very selective even though I could be greedy
My main objective is to write our names together in graffiti
And are be (?) so y'all can see me, speedy
(naw see)
You can be my centipede like we-be-fore-play
Cause I gourmet my food up like eatie and Maxwell
Similar to that smooth kid's C-D
Monch, easily the most measily unmistakable
Believe me

Chorus

Pharoahe Monch:

This one little chick she pissed me off
Comin out the store, now I'm holdin the door
To the Bodega, she got a little man with her
Figuring if I kicks it to the kid then I could get her right
Say listen
I see you around every night around seven o'clock
You walkin up the block (?) with the rocks on the side of the crib
With your kid on ya hip and ya close top notch
You know the thirst baby
First we can deal with the math if you search through your purse for a pen
We can blast off
Like Hubble Space Craft material
I'm aware of you and your concern about vanirial diseases
If it pleases you, shit, Jesus
I pack profolactics that stretch to my knees
She squinted, with a demented look behind a tented glass of a girlfriend
Rented, Benz E-Class vented hate
But still hinted like I was self centered
She said speak to the hand
Y'all know that shit that girls invented
Aww, see it didn't have to be be like that wit you fiberglass
Backboard ass that's mad flat bitch

Shugah Shorty why you backin up, got a nigga out here iggy actin up

Hurricane G:

Who that big flat piece of chocolate
Sparkin it, rockin it, "uhh, uhh-uhh," rockin it

Prince Poetry:

My name is Prince, boo
Now few who speak don't be true
But you, you got this lovely but rugged stiggy
How you do?
Get out the car, lemmie see you
Now what's your name?

Hurricane G: "Star"

Prince Poetry:

Body was bizarre, yo Star, where you live?

Hurricane G:

Rockaway Beach out in the boons
My niggas put five on it and stack all I like the Loons
Packin twos
So Pappi what you say?

Prince Poetry:

When I'm grown I don't hump, I bone
I ain't playin
I'm a man who likes a treat
Message feet of the independent Queen
To throw up some heat
Shit girl I can fix you something to eat
Prepare a five course meal while I'm makin the beat
Already got two things in this beautiful universal common
That's lovin a tight ass fuck, and some tight ass rymin
So what
We into somethin or your frontin, pilgrum
I ain't askin a protif be for make children
I'm skilled in body messages and sexual healin

...1, 2, 3, YO!

[Redman, (Hurricane G)]

Kicked in the door then I yell, "Don't move!"
C.O's is like, "Yo, who the fuck is this dude?"
I'll give you a little hint, it's the Soopaman Luva
Took the shotgun from him, then I shot that fucker
Threw it to Hurricane, she like (Yeah! Let's do it!)
Snatched up the reporter that was here to interview her
Raised up one of his hands, put a bullet through it
Took off his Franck Muller
So daily news knew the time it took to rescue her
We going out the front door
Hurricane, shotgun, hand letting the pump off
Bitches see it and started wildin' in the mess hall
(Fuck the warden, we gon' get you, muh'fucka!)

Yo, I told you I was coming
(Nigga, I ain't never scared
I ain't giving no state time for shit I ain't did
Gimme some more ammo, the front door's near
We're two barrels smokin')
With a hostage in here
Yo, G, you lock and load?
(Lock and load)
Plan came together like the Eleven and Bellagio
We out the front door
Warden, shotty blow
I mash the gas, to me and G, its "Adios!"

That's how that Soopaman Luva get down
(Yeah, that's how that bitch Hurricane get down)

[Redman]
Yo, yo, what up yo, I be the Soopaman luva
I'm about five minutes right out ya baby mother
I'm still broke, still gutter
Hit four chicks, then avenge like folk brothers
Then rob a bank teller
I'm sorta like old yella, call me for trouble
I got chop for bullets that spread out the umbrella
I'm advanced boy, da doc bigalow, the man whore
Got Ms. Incredible and cat women on amcord
When neighborhood or city in a drought
Fuck a boat I could fly there, 300 an ounce
Reup my account, wear and durag and I ain't got waves
I only got haze pumpin out the bat cave
So when I'm flyin through ya hood it's a hit nigga
Isabella I need that sour diesel quick nigga
-Call for soopman luva on line 3-
Well who the fuck is it?
-Her name is Hurricane G-
What up G?

[Hurricane G]
They tryin to lock me up G
I can't do time cause my time is money
I just came from court for some bullshit charge
They tryin to do me like kim, throw me behind bars
What am I gonna do?

[Redman]
Fuck that I'm comin
With a gun like willis so you could feel drummin
I creep in when the lights out, sneak in to get you out
Lo jacks on my ears to tell me where your where abouts
Cause I air 'em out, sneak in though the West wing
Laundromat, duffle bag thinking of the next thing

[G] But I'm in the East wing
[R] Damn my shit broke
[G] Hurry up nigga, this water look piss cold

[Redman]
Hold tight for me, I'm already in
I'm in the kitchen corridor, climbin up the vent
I'm hot so hurricane so it might take me awhile
So when I get ya we gonna roll like mickey and loud

[Hook]

[Redman]
Here we go, Yo, Yo the Soopaman Luv
Crawlin through the vent like that dude in breakfast club
I made a pit stop, seen a freak in the shower
So I gotta quick pop, pimp slapped her with powder
And told her if somebody asks you, you seen nada
And every week I come fuck you with marijuana

[G] Okay if you looking for Hurricane over there
[R] Oh shit, Hurricane
[G] Hey yo get me outta here

[Redman]
Hey yo C.O.'s watchin
Gotta move like grown men
Cause a distraction
Like the food gave you stomach pain
When the doctors come in, start the examining
I rush in with rubber gloves off the ambulance
Gun in one hand, the other palm around the nurse mouth
On the count of three this is how its gonna work out
1, 2...[ Intro ]
[ Hurricane G ]
What up ? What up ? Ye Yea..
East Coast west Coast flavor in the muthafucking house

What the fuck? I said What the fuck!?

What the fuck!? What the muthafuck?!? Yeah

[ Hurricane G ]
Hurricane G, comin through with the Tres Delinquents
Por mi gente, strapped with fuertes

Wreaking MCs like Tito Puentes
Beating drums, flipping flows in different thongues
Leaving all you muthafuckas sprung
Without giving up the chocha
My lyrics, is enough to make you loco, maricon!
My shit is packed like chicharon
Fuckin' MCs up like Ron
Niggas, shakin' more ass than strippers!
For all my bitches and niggas

I turned down the base, start to kickin up the treble
Put the music in my earphones, so I can check my level
Tu no sabes que es la mierda comin out your speaka
It's the Tres Delinquentes, Sen Dog y la Boricua
I don't be braggin', That drama's for your mom
But this collaboration right here, it's the bomb
And when Ives's comes to party,  starts to sway g
Bomb styles, poppin' Improv and [ ... ] Pays me
Chingaso, when your cold hard and when I [ ... ]
To clean your crap, leave your punk-ass retarded
The one, to the two, to the three delinquentes
Sen Dog, Hurricane G to your frente

High as a kite, it's the capitan pinga loca
With a fifth of bacardi and a brain full of mota
Representin' all the cliqua from the southside
And any fuckin' body who tha Brownpride
Takin' back to the avenue me mocho pa' mi gente
Con la Hurricane G y los vatos delinquentes
El cubano marijuano que te deja taranteado
Been down since '83, DVX con mi hermano

I gots to entertain all the vatos and the cholas
So take it to the neighborhood and spread it on the calle
Que al perro negro, no le vale madre!!

[ Chorus ] X2

[ Kemo the Blaxican ]
The latin season thats the reason, homeboy
For all the flavor thats on the table
The blaxican once again, so just as quick and fable
Im strangling mics, from el Lunes to Domingo
Te chingo, te digo el gringo's got my back, the lingo bringo
No mas o menos, simply stacks up the tracks
So sip the [...]
Porque el ritmo pega duro like a kick to your sack
Y si me miras en los ojos recojo puro respeto
Y las palabras de mi boca empezaron en los cesos
Asi lo ves homeboy, I putting it down thats con mi cliqua
Hurricane, Sen Dog, Delinquents blowin' up your speaka
Otra vez, ya lo ves, somos tres
Bring the rock thats how it is... Cuz' I don't give a fuck!

[ Chorus ] X2
... Bitch!!!
