[Intro: Zack De La Rocha]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them
Fuck the slow mo

[Verse 1: Killer Mike (El-P)]
Fashion slave, you protestin' to get in a fuckin' look book
Everything I scribble's like an anarchist's cookbook
(Look good, posin' in the centerfold of Crook Book)
Black on black on black with the ski mask, that is my crook look
How you like my stylin' bruh? ain't nobody smilin' bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh
Where my thuggers and my crippers and my blooders and my brothers?
When you niggas gon' unite and kill the police, mothafuckas?
And take over a jail, give them COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur, goddamn I love the smell
Now get to pillow torchin', where the fuck the warden?
And when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him
We killin' them for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em

[Verse 2: El-P (Killer Mike)]
We out a order, your honor, you're out a order
This whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a clip wig synonym livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian, I'm fucked from the jump
I wear my Yankee so tilted I actually walk with a hunch
Look at Mikey, I think he likey, we are sinister sons
(And we the type to greet the preacher with a grin and a gun)

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them

[Verse 3: El-P (Killer Mike)]
A wise man once said, ("We all dead, fuck it")
Just spit it disgustin' youngin' and hold your nuts while you gunnin'
I listened, tatted the sentence on my dick last summer
Now I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin', waitin' for the christenin'
I know the neighbors can't help but listen in
A dirty boy who come down on the side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison
The only solace I have is the act of conjugal visiting

[Verse 4: Killer Mike (El-P)]
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Though mainly missin' my missus, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is given vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers and slavers of men and women
Including members of clergy that rule on you through religion
(He'll strip your kids to the nude and then tell 'em God will forgive 'em)

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha]

[Verse 5: Zack De La Rocha]
It's De La on the cut,lifting six on your snitching crew
I'm miles ahead of you, you can sip my bitches brew
My battle status is burning mansions from Dallas to Malibu
Check my résumé, your residence is residue
Call her a skin job and my honey dip will backflip for you
You playin' God, your eye sockets she gon' rip into
We sick of bleeding now trey spray and victim you
Done dyin', Phillip AK Dick in you
With clips in the bottom, we dipping through Gotham
Yes eclipsed by the shadows, a dark dance to the coffin
I'm a fellow with melanin, suspect of a felony
Rip like Rakim Allah, feds be checkin' my melody
Yes aggressively testin' with bunk stretches and penalties
Dump cases when facing to cop pleas when we seizing the pump
With reason to dump on you global grand dragons
Still piling fast bucks, Afghani toe taggin'
Know they trackin' me cause we bustin' back, see
The only thing that close quicker than our caskets be the factories

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Bunches and bunches
Punches is thrown until you’re frontless
Oodles and oodles
Bang bullets at suckers' noodles
Last album voodoo
Proved that we was fuckin' brutal
I’m talking crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo
You rappers doodoo
Baby shit, just basic boo boo
I’m Shaka Zulu
Mansa Musa, my money's buku
My beats is bangin’
Fuck what you rappin
Who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got
And Run The Jewels you

[Verse 2: El-P]
You itsy bitsy
Furry frightened
And fricken' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for Winter swimming
Look at these kiddies, Mike
I'm a rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work
Do the deed and then dash
Ditch 'em I'd lend a hand but they stuck in a fist and gun position
We run a brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It’s all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear in the smoke
Like we're fucking magicians

[Verse 3: Killer Mike & (El-P)]
No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers
(We might be giants, standing on little dandy shoulders)
You punks is pussy proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake ‘em, DDT ‘em in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my colosseum
(They all actors, giving top in back of a BM
I’d fall back if the casting calls are ending in semen)

[Verse 4: EL-P]
I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluation
I'm a phallus, a Johnson, a jimmy spraying faces
Any cow that is sacred will get defaced
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced
Face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you're like, "Mellow out, man, just relax, it's really not that complicated"
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just insane as you explained
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is deranged

[Verse 5: Killer Mike]
This Run The Jewels is
Murder, mayhem, melodic music
Psychotics use it to lose it
Junkies simply abuse
That's word to Phillip Seymour Hoff' and I'm kushin'
Coughin'
I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin
The gates of hell are pugnaciously pacin'
Waitin'
I give a fuck if I'm late, tell Satan be patient
But I ain't here for durations, I'm just taking vacations
And tell him fuck him, I never loved him and salutations[Intro]
Darling-d-d-darling
Dar-dar-dar-dar-d-ling
Oh my
Oh my

[Verse 1: El-P]
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp
Hol up
(You are now listening to Run the Jewels 2)
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick,  that's word to Pimp
I don't fuck with or talk, like all these fuckin' imps
Style violent,  give a fuck if you deny it, kids
You can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit, that's word to B.I.G
I dreamt we owned the world, but I've woken up and it don't exist, Soak it in, I need no assist, you can't slap my wrist, I don't owe you shit
Trust me, I'm a doctor
DOOM, oper-
Rate of my pulse, won't raise a bit

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Tip-toe on the track like a ballerina
Ski mask, in a Pontiac Catalina
It's obese, female opera singer
You can run the jewels, or lose your fingers
Me and El-P got time to kill, got folks to kill, on overkill
He hangin' out the window, I hold the wheel
One black, one white, we shoot to kill
That fuckboy life about to be repealed
That fuckboy shit about to be repelled fuckboy Jihad, kill infidels
Allah Akbar, boom from Mike and El

[Verse 3: El-P]
Life is hell, death's a bitch and these fubar rulers getting rich
I cop a zip, it opens up, I smoke it up, go home and fuck
C'est la vie girl, when in Rome
I gave the face, please pay with dome
My business card says you're in luck
I do two things, I rap and fuck

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
I fuck and rap
I tote the strap, I smoke the kush, I beat the puss
I read the books, did the math
Don't need a preacher preachin' on my behalf
No teacher can teach my arrogant ass
I'm blowin' on crippy while readin' inscriptions that's written by Egyptians and sippin' on whiskey
Ay, baby you with me?

[Hook]
Oh my
Don't cry (x4)

[Verse 5: El-P]
[Whip Crack]
We run this spot like a Chinese sweatshop
Don't stop, work it work it till chest pop
Cardiac arrested, I'm so invested I'm self-invented, that no illusion, there's no confusion you see the future, you fear the future
I've seen the truth and I'm so deluded
I been a better bad guy than I been better than bad
Been a bit a bully talk beating in my chest in fact
I'm a half stack from a rack
I been around the block, babe, I know a few facts
Maniac, brainiac, run go tell them that
ATLien, NY felon rap

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Handle me wrong I'm snappin'
Show up at your class, what's happenin'?
Schoolyard bully with a fully automatic
Heart full of pain and a head full of havoc
Everybody stepped on the kid and I'm letting them have it
Havoc
Leaving they momma to say "what happened?"
Who gon buy my baby a casket?
Fuck that bitch I'm a bastard

[Verse 7: El-P]
Megablast, I'm mega lit
On Highway 6 and I'm not strapped in
I don't crash, bitch, I just skid
You got the cash, I'll make the trip
I make the trip, you better pay
Done worse for less, don't make my day
I'm not from Earth, from far away
I bust through chests like baby greys

[Verse 8: Killer Mike]
Runnin' the jewels of the game
Whippin' the mix is like chickens of 'caine
Spittin' the sentence again
Parents is livid again
Kids is just fuckin' insane
Pointin' that pistol and fist for the chain
Reppin the symbol like they in a gang
Delivery dope like a dosage of dope or a noseful of coke for a junkie or fiend

[Hook]
Oh my
Don't cry(x2)[Verse 1: El-P]
Oh dear what the fuck have we here?
These motherfuckers all thorn no rose
Egads what a bad dream better not sleep
Take a No-Doz, do some blow
Oh shit what the hell have we done?
It's alive and it's hungry as fuck
Better hide all the snacks and the dough
It is out of my control, you are shit out of luck
I don't wanna be unfair but the pair
We got beat that weak shit you got (true god)
Blew up the spot with that new bop
Crew drops, do up ya squad without nuance
I don't wanna sound unkind but the
Sounds I make are the sounds of the hounds
That are howlin - Under your bed I'm here growling
Same time under the blanket you're cowering

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Cowering like cowards cowering on
Concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's wilding
We often smile at sights of violence
Acting brave and courageous
Ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say run the jewels
Just run' em baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady
The fam god damn we fuckin crazy
I'll pull this pistol
Put it on your poodle or your fuckin baby
She clutched the pearls, said "What in the world!"
And "I won't give up shit!"
I put the pistol on that poodle
And I shot that bitch

[Hook]
Run the jewels...(x2)

[Verse 3: El-P]
And the crowd chants "Get that paper!"
And the mob says "Kill that witch!"
This city get mad to the max
Better wave bye-de bye to the high scrapes kids
Get a tin foil hat for the rain, in
Hot water from the roof to the basement
I'mma smoke 'til the planet erases
Build a white flag out of Zig Zags, wave it

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Often I'm smoking coffin
Sip lean on a bean like Boston
My young bitch here fine like
Pam Grier when she made that movie Coffy
But when my wife's in town
Ay Jackie Brown just stay up off me
Cause if they don't somebody get shot
And they gon' buy a coffin

[Verse 5: El-P]
With the pull of a pin a grenade
Get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win I been made
To be loud while these other cats drowning in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk get accosted
I'm a sin on the verse like a kid in a hearse
Or a nun in a cum shot (stop it)

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Big beast in a cage with a heart
Full of rage, it seems I can't behave
You could try till you die, oh well
You failed, it seems the world can't be saved
These streets is full with the wolves
That starve for the week so they after the weak
In a land full of lambs I am
And I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth

[Hook][Verse 1: El-P]
Smoke from the loosie drift
Hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of bein' excellent the median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold
Authorities have spoken, demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground while the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano, y'all know, kinda bat shit
The bright lights of fuckery stuck in me automatic
I’ll tea bag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who’ll swim like directly after he's eaten
While holding a toaster oven that's plugged with a fork in it
Cause death by electrocution's like life in New York, isn't it?
Shoulda been a dentist, mom said it
Pain's the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors that I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop I can chop it up with exacto touch
Whats the rush?
Autograph skin flaps, tag em up
I don't brag enough you de facto suck
A lotta you new to the El Producto milieu
Kinda like “fuck is you?”
I'm a little black spot on a sun of lies
But I'm not too high to say I'm the truth
I line the booth to catch blood like a Bateman
Nothing sacred I’ll mace a play pen
Jewel runner bitch make the name stick
Not for sale but I'm takin payments

[Hook: Killer Mike]
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
(Everybody's doin’ it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
Everybody doin’ it
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
(Everybody's doin’ it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I’m fly as a pegasus, that’s no embellishment
I’m here to pain the whole game, where the Excedrin
Good pussy, good marijuana that be my medicine
And I’m a mixture of MJG and the Weathermen
A revolutionary bangin' on my adversaries
And I love Dr. King but violence might be necessary
Cause when you live on MLK and it gets very scary
You might have to pull your AK, send one to the cemetery
We overworked, underpaid, and we underprivileged
They love us, they love us (why?)
Because we feed the village
You really made it or just became a prisoner of privilege?
You willing to share that information that you’ve been given?
Like who really run this?
Like who really run that man that say he run this?
Who who really run that man that say he run this
Run run run run this?
Like who really fund this?
Like who really fund who say he fund this?
Like who in the world gon' tell Donald Sterl who to put on the “you can’t come” list?
Now don’t be silly
Who the fuck gon' bully me if I got a billi?
If I got a billi and the bitch recording me I’m like who cares
What I wouldn’t be is on TV stutterin' ta-ta-talkin' scared
So the question is when Don’s at home with that traitor ass bitch alone
Who’s that voice on the side of the phone that shakes and rattles his bones?
Could it be the man behind the man behind the man behind the throne?
Gone

[Hook]

Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Reminiscin-in' on our time of innocence
When we drank that Hennessy, ate on lamb and venison
Face fucked you in your kitchenette, fucked you like we tusslin'
Do you fuck your husb-al-and? Like, do y'all be tusslin'?
Do you wear the muzzlin'? Do you ask him pretty please?
Do you crawl on hands and knees, like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl, the world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else, I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this, pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin', I think I'm in love again
Found my perfect drug again, feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance, 2 Live Crew the narrative
And there it is

[Hook: Killer Mike & Gangsta Boo]
I put that dick in her mouth all day
She got that (dick in her mouth all day)
She take that (dick in her mouth all day)
(She said she wanted my, wanted my)
Dick in her mouth all day, day
I give her that (dick in her mouth all day)
She play with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She want that (dick in her mouth all day)
I think I'm in love again (Love again)

[Verse 2: El-P]
Here I am, my love
Just like when we first hooked up
Feeling like I'm animal
Feeling like you're edible
Bendable
I been away
I don't have too much to say
You say say it anyway
I say take your shit off I'm not playing bae
You little freak
What you are is so unique
Smart and full of filth and joy
You been with some little boys
Now you're with a grown-up man
One who'll actually understands
Kid gloves are not on my hands
I will never condescend
Now spread yourself
She smiled a bit
Gripped the outline of my shit
Oh, my god, I love this chick
I must put my tongue in this
Into every space I go
Give me everything you am
She said, "No, you gimme first"
That was like a day ago
8 AM
She still got my

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
That's what you want huh?
Well let me tell you a little story
I had a young player from the hood
Lick my pussy real good
Kept me stuck with lots of wood
Kept my bank account on swoll
Sniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro
Made a porn tape, that nigga is a pro, you ain't know?
He had a lot of bad bitches in his past
But I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man
His tongue is bomb
And he love for me to ride his face
Front to back, grippin' ass
Pay my bills, where I live, fuck me good
Broke ass niggas killing me
I'm about my money, ho
Never been a square bitch
He ain't paying? Hit the fuckin' door
Talking slick, that Memphis shit
I be from that Haven click
Keep it ratchet so sweet
All these boys kiss my feet
I be on that queen shit
You better bless my realness
Stick your tongue up in my ass
You better show me who you fuckin' with
Run The Jewels
Love again, you gon' lose, I'm gon' win
Let's have an orgy
I'mma share your ass with all my friends (Yeah, ho!)

[Hook 2: Gangsta Boo]
He want this clit in his mouth all day
He want this clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I've got this I've got this fool in love again (Yeah ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I put my clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
He want this clit in his mouth all day
I've got this fool in love again (Love again)[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
It be feelin' like the life that I’m livin' man out of control
Like every day I’m in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine’s the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask “why you’re here?”
I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that’s what it is
He chimed “you got a dime?
I said “Man, I’m tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don’t lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife
Man, I ain’t got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
Cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son”
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said “shut up”
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and
Put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk
And hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
Cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

[Hook: Boots]
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this way, feeling this way
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Feeling this, feeling this early
Early (x4)

[Verse 2: El-P]
It be feelin' like the life that I’m living man, I don’t control
Cause every day I’m in a fight for my soul
All hands below, high seas in a rickety boat
Smoke o’s so the kid might cope
You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don’t pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y’all
That the true truth’s truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth’s truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording
But didn’t record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched cop make girl bleed
Go to home, go to sleep, up again early

[Hook][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Bitch we be that shit that's right
Number two boo boo straight caca (yeah)
I smoke ganja with a dreadlocked rasta
Move like Frank you will die like a hassa
Move like Jesus die like a martyr
Hell of a choice when you're riding on the MARTA
Trying to get some hoes in the hot car
How far is we away, man? Not far
The greatness they claim, not all
Are not, we are those juggernauts
Me El, we hail
Like a young Che Guevara and Fidel
Castro, cash flow, car full of females
Bad hoes, we in the DR
Any fuck rapper boy gettin' out of line I pray the preacher beat him to the goddamn ER

I spit them country rap tunes like Hee-Haw
Cocaine flow fishscale no re-rock
Take a snort for yourself shawty, see? "he raw...
(sniff) See he raw!"
That’s you shawty go on snort your nose off
Then put the news in the street Tom Brokaw
Cause of you shawty met a bad stone bitch out of Brooklyn and that Brooklyn bitch straight got broke off
Yeah she called her homegirl from the BX, freaky lil 'Rican brought X and we sexed
Couple months later brought 'em down to Atlanta and let 'em style on the 'bamas that's right yeah we flex
Heard she got a baby daddy and a nigga acting aggy runnin' round talkin' 'bout yeah he plexed
Nigga better pray for a ho like he Tebow though cause right now he stay losin’ like The Jets

[Hook: El-P]
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain

[Verse 2: El-P]
Bitch we be that shit that's right
Light a flare put your thumbs in the air high five
I came for the stash box gimme that
I been waitin' for this all my life
3 AM and I'm still not right
Still awake still away from fading
Crazy
Psilocybin
Why the ride so hazy
Dribble this spit till the street gets wavy
The bliss and pure shit magician
Get to skipping
Not too tall dark and handsome man
But I talk dark for ransoms man
Spend grands of those zombies
Folded origami
Yes I bag the clams
Anyone object to the styles, get a smile and a backwards hand

Peep that, venomous fangs on the face of an angel
Bringing that buckshot back to the table
Been a veteran, earthbound hellion
Try to say grace get a face full of staples
Woke up and the city air smelled like maple
If you come straight from New York you relate
If you come straight from another place stay tuned
Me and Mike got the whole map held safe

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Be it NYC or the ATL
From the ceilings of heaven to the gates of hell
We murder death killed every stage we step
Homicide times two better warn yourself, El

[Verse 4: El-P]
Anybody looking for some trouble better self med
We could double dutch in a minefield, hell gets
Just the right temperature, break beat minister
Riverdance cleats on your face for the finisher[Verse 1: El-P]
That was me in BK on Atlantic
Never looked both ways, ran in traffic
Pops went away but I stayed, vagrant
Placed where the steel and cement became nature
Love what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous
Cityscape where the blood of good men courses
And the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain
Take a knee to the gods and get horse shit
Wanna live for the thrill? They'll arrange it
Got a bevy of imps to spit hatred
Shit'll get in your head and cause panic
Have you desperately begging to get famous
Get your dignity dirty and left orphaned
Sanity on the fringe of distorted
Who are they to just take shit and hoard it?
Who am I that I don't get my portion?
The most impressionable minds get molested and informed by manipulating forces
Don't fret little man, don't cry, they can never take the energy inside you were born with
Knowing that, understand you could never be poor
You already won the war, you were born rich
You can only take the energy you had
Going back to the realm or the home where your lord is
Whoever whatever that lord is couldn't
Give a fuck if you ever made fortunes
Fuck anyone ever trying to run that bum shit
Send 'em to the flames where the orcs live
Them and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us
Don't understand love's importance
And we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth
Where the ashes and dust got formed in

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
The beat breaks and your teeth break
Keep your canines embedded in my knuckles as a keepsake
It would seem your veneers just mere souvenirs falling out your mouth and on to the landscape
Me and El-P do the secret handshake
Then I pummel punch a pumpkin head punk in his pimple face
'Till he's punch drunk cause he's sweet as a pound cake
(Ain't he pussy, Mike?) Yeah, El, I'll say
Into the wild, wildstyle ghetto child running wild
Where the lions and the owls stay
The powers that be even offered up reprieves
Told us they ain't take us out if we bow to our knees
But they can give that to the kings and the queens
And the worshipers of idols and followers of things
Cause I would rather be in the jungle with the savages
It's kill or be killed, and I'm working with the averages
My professor emeritus
Say we been cursed being brought to the Americas
How you raise a whole human single parent, no marriages no sense of heritage
Planned Parenthood helping plan miscarriages
But I'm lucky mommy already had a narrative
Product of a teenage love, my arrogance
Derives from the pride in the job my parents did
Named Mike, I was told it was godlike
Even danced with the devil, came out alright
OK, honor y'all? No way
Still spell Amerikkka with the triple K
Word up to Spice 1 and O'Shea
And any MC peeping what I go through
Real rap, my last line's so true
Rest in peace to Pimp C and Camu, too
We do it for you[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
This year we iller than a nun in a cumshot
Gettin’ double penetrated in a dope spot
By two hard pipe hittin’ niggas
On the orders of Marcellus to the soundtrack of 2pac
I’ll beat you to a pulp no fiction
Tarantino flow new Jules and Vincent
Blow marijuana smoke no incense
Exhale in the face of innocent infants
On some "Ah hah look what I did" shit
And if I get stopped by a crooked ass cop I'm a put a bullet in a pig
And Rin Tin Tin, ah hah hah look what I did again
We the hooligans outside of school again
Sayin don’t be a fool never follow rules again
We the bad boys bully with the fully that
The teachers say ain’t shit and in the need of discipline
We the goddamn reason for ritalin
In the back of the class, twitchin’ and fidgetin’
Dead wrong we never got along
We laughed at the kids that was active participants
Bad boy walk right past church with the work in a bag
And a bible of Gideon
Got suspended for bullyin' a bully
When I go back to class I'ma punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again

[Hook]
Cause you get no respect

[Verse 2: El-P]
I don't flirt with greatness I wifed it in Vegas
The shits all paid for I signed the papers
Used to date but then I made her my main bitch
Bought us a place on a lake with some acreage
And Mike's my neighbor straight from Greatville
Any invader get slayed and stay killed
On sovereign land, Mike fill the safe up
We call when the fam get paid a great thrill
I Bad News Bear hug beats then creep off
You drive a rape van
Mullet Ray-Bans
We do Vicious
You do witness
You don't clap shit you's a cricket
Run the J’s we don't run so much it’s all fun and games till my J’s get scuffed
I'm livid, fuming, out of touch
I wear sweatpants to funerals, guns to lunch
Close the blinds they got drones and mines we so close to the lie I can almost die
I got no goals left but to save my mind
They got more holes dug In the earth, oh my
The beat get abused like I rock a wife beater
Drinker, fired by the company
Friday, late on the car note tryna do taxes
This my house it's high or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway

[Hook]

[Verse 3: El-P]
I'm a thrill killer, I will test you
Just like daddy fuckin' left you
It’s all your fault, mommy's lonely
You’re a burden, she needs rescue

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Hey little buddy, where’s your mommy?
Call me stepdad or Uncle Johnny
Here’s a dollar don’t follow behind me
I gotta go bang out mom and auntie

[Verse 5: El-P]
I hunt lions, tigers, rare vaginas
Hang where the cops seem scared to find us
Pop stars peep the bars and rewind us
Fuck your life but first run the diamonds
From the jungle (the jungle) the brothers (the brothers)
Can't relate to your first world struggles
You want safety, hugs and cuddles
IED’s will leave bloody puddles

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Woke up in Nigeria
Kicked out America
Case of malaria
Shit got scarier
Got left with a gun and a pitbull terrier
And a note from my dad said I hope God carry ya
Fought one or two wars while I made It to the shores
Y’know back to the home of a rock in Georgia
To return as a king, Michael the benevolent
Gold draped ridin' on the neck of an elephant

[Hook][Intro: Killer Mike]
(Paul is dead)
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for...One time for...
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for the...One, one-one-one

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
One time for the pill and the reefer man
It's the young black leader to the people, man
If you’re girl’s fine, nigga might eat her, man
I'm talkin' middle of the mall like a pita, man
A Nigga sky high now like Jesus, man
And oh Lord this reefer so potent
Got an anti gravity, a Nigga stay floatin'
This nigga rob me, bitch you must be jokin'
Like pow pow pow leave your chestplate open
One half the best tag team ever
Them other fellas all right we better
Anybody disagree they jealous
And anybody don’t just motherfucking yellow (just yellow)
Fuck a boss I’m the goddamn owner
And I smell like YSL and marijuana
Don Draper with the paper might pull a slick caper
Secretary told me "fuck you," I told her you gonna

[Hook]
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch
(All my life)
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch

[Verse 2: EL-P]
Sharp like knife
Bet a buck I’m stuck in the guts of the night
And I’m (ready on the right)
Please pass that already, alright
Get fetti, he’s steady on the mic
What the fuck else can he do right?
Step armed heavy and he brought Mike
Never step light, no fair fights
We got the drugs y'all wanted
Take a suck on the tail of a comet
I’m so high you a hobbit
Dick level, please back up off it
Better off dead like Paul is
Your name don't Ring, go Starrless
Me and Mike we a friend to the farmers
The weed run out, we might cop your whole harvest

[Hook]

Go! (x32)[Verse 1: El-P]
A little toast to the no ones
With a nod to the masters
To the ones with the riches
From the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys
A little nod to the spirits
We're still here runnin' round screaming
They're still here pointing and laughin'
Don't walk away when I talk
I'm tellin' you
Turn around mister
I got a permanent bop
Who the hell do I think I am not
And I'm twice as hot
As about half of hell
I get lighthouse lit up
Get down diduck
The boy got a barracuda bite
You can tell

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Got hope for the living
Got prayers for the dead
In the sky got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain
Cause the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane
Anchor themselves with angel dust
Somewhere between love and lust
A nut get bust
And a baby get made
It seems that trouble trouble us and follow us
Like all our days
In every holy book it says we suffer that's what it is
So riddle me this from the womb to the tomb why do
We fight to live

[Hook 1: EL-P]
(RTJ)
A little toast to the no ones
With a nod to the masters (RTJ)
To the ones with the riches
From the ones who the rags fit (RTJ)
A little smoke for the gone boys

They're still here pointing and laughin' (RTJ)

[Hook 2: Killer Mike]

In the sky got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head (RTJ)
Got kush for the pain
Cause the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane
Anchor themselves with angel dust

[Verse 3: El-P]
You say you wanna be my leader
I think you wanna be my God
You say you on the side of the righteous
I say I'm gonna hang with the wrong
There's truth where the filth is
There's lies in the law
You want a whore with a white dress
I want a wife in a thong
You love fear and division
I ain't fuck with your symbolism
I don't give a fuck about power
I'll pluck an eye out a pyramid
Cut a ear from a mouse hat
Go Van Gogh on a house rat
Find another mind to devour
Motherfucker I'm really not hearin' it

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
A pope is a fraud
A church is a lie
A queen is the same damn thing
You should pray to your fake god that she die
God really exists I tell you like this it reside inside
And anybody tell you different, just selling you religion, tryin' to keep your ass in line
I kill my masters
I mentor none
That means when I die that's it
My style is gone I'm a one of one
One half of the great RTJ
Defeated the odds went to war with the gods
Earned all our scars and came back straight

[Hook 1: EL-P]
[Hook 2: Killer Mike]

Angel Dust
Angel Dust

[Piano outro][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence eloquent as the president
Evident is the emphasis, I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip I'mma chill so my man can rip

[Verse 2: El-P]
Little man against Hellion with the heart of an orphan
I got the words of a murderer and an eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds, Keep an O.Z in my pocket

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
We run the jewels in your town, a quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage, I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year
I said "El-P didn't do it so get the fuck outta here!"

[Verse 4: El-P]
You wanna hang, bring your throat, I got stools and a rope
I'mma slang pope, haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new edition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome

[Verse 5: Killer Mike]
Ay El
We the villains, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talk cause meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on you Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at your crib with your kids saying "fuck your fort
Lil' nigga!"

[Verse 6: El-P]
The style is radiation leak at Mile Island
Also known as Chernobyl talk, listen for the sirens
For the green I'm a hoarder, you're the poor distorter
Sorta morbid sonnin' these fuckin' whoredome explorers, I'm bored
Enough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure
You suck a good dick for the fame and couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war, I'm really not playing no games
But tag me god damn it I'll kill the carrier mentions my name

[Verse 7: Killer Mike]
Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat
I'm merciless, I'll torture emcees, tie up both of they feet
If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth
Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap
Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys, next time do better
Bitch

[Verse 8: Big Boi]
We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta, future of the city
Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn cause can't nann new niggas get with me
Now it's true, niggas are simply simple minded simple Simons
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing
But what I be rhyming, no payola is required
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
Nigga your lease is up, you're fired
Quiet, that's how the boss talk
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought
And paid for, no neighbors cause I'm sitting on acres
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom cause I wasn't trippin' on papers
Or no prenuptual agreement for mama
If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas
Eight figures nigga[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Bunches and bunches
Punches is thrown until you’re frontless
Oodles and oodles
Bang bullets at suckers' noodles
Last album voodoo
Proved that we was fuckin' brutal
I’m talking crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo
You rappers doodoo
Baby shit, just basic boo boo
I’m Shaka Zulu
Mansa Musa, my money's buku
My beats is bangin’
Fuck what you rappin
Who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got
And Run The Jewels you

[Verse 2: El-P]
You itsy bitsy
Furry frightened
And fricken' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for Winter swimming
Look at these kiddies, Mike
I'm a rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work
Do the deed and then dash
Ditch 'em I'd lend a hand but they stuck in a fist and gun position
We run a brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It’s all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear in the smoke
Like we're fucking magicians

[Verse 3: Killer Mike & (El-P)]
No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers
(We might be giants, standing on little dandy shoulders)
You punks is pussy proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake ‘em, DDT ‘em in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my colosseum
(They all actors, giving top in back of a BM
I’d fall back if the casting calls are ending in semen)

[Verse 4: EL-P]
I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluation
I'm a phallus, a Johnson, a jimmy spraying faces
Any cow that is sacred will get defaced
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced
Face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you're like, "Mellow out, man, just relax, it's really not that complicated"
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just insane as you explained
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is deranged

[Verse 5: Killer Mike]
This Run The Jewels is
Murder, mayhem, melodic music
Psychotics use it to lose it
Junkies simply abuse
That's word to Phillip Seymour Hoff' and I'm kushin'
Coughin'
I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin
The gates of hell are pugnaciously pacin'
Waitin'
I give a fuck if I'm late, tell Satan be patient
But I ain't here for durations, I'm just taking vacations
And tell him fuck him, I never loved him and salutations[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
The elephant's in the room, I’m talking two ton(as)
Bitter truth to ya’ face, like this is two gun(as)
One half of the crew, you know them jewel runners
Move us out of our lane, shit who’s gonna?
Shit stain on they brain, that’s right- poo’d on ‘em
And pissed on ‘em! Dirt kicked on ‘em!
Shot his cat, pop that pussy, threw that bitch!
Stood behind his mama, put my dick on her!
Killer did a Killa Cam- couldn’t kill a kid so I spit on her! (Puuuuh!) Like this on her!

[Verse 2: El-P]
I somersault in the room and then pop to the van damme split on em
Rappers all get the dick like they got clits on em
Big and sweaty testicular cancer induced tits on em
The love to hug and cry and explain what they are the victim of
Braid each others hair and tell stories bout how they’ve been in love
Hey kids I’m a computer, I’m a trooper feeling super, shoot the future like a looper
You tryna step like gooses ima go home with your luger
The tie-ers of the nooses get a broom up in their pooper

[Bridge: Killer Mike]
This is for the dope do-er, ho pursuer
If you procure then you cut her and stick her like a skewer
See this is for paupers and the prisoner, authors of the literature
Opposers to the holders of the swastika insignia

[Verse 3: Despot]
Cue the music I’m bout to do something stupid
I got a new shiny tool kit to fix your face and I’ll use it
Flippin birds I ain’t talkin no middle fingers
Come line up to kiss the ring of your favorite rap singer
Des pot roast comin out the oven hot
Stuntin on you bumbaclots fronting like you runnin blocks
Bet your mother love to watch you come up out ya fuckin socks
Spin the barrel take a shot loves you or it loves you not
Pop..schlepping weapons out the seven
Betting on who gettin to heaven first with the henchmen
Try to test me I’ll send some shots at your keppy
You best address me correctly but mama still calls me Lechky

[Verse 4: Wiki]
When someone ask me to spit it, I’m nasty
Like a cabbie with cricket, I know it like the back of my hand
I actually did it If you even think ‘bout dapping my hand
Homie better be dapper than Dan, You wit it
Actually fam, what you wanna gonna laugh at me fam?
Right cause I’m tacky and tan
It’s actually him pass me the gin
Pass me whatever you got, pass me your bitch
Pass me the clip hit it hold it now it’s bout time to pass me the 5th Sipit
Soledmysoulforitpass it back to the bitch
Hopefully she get half as just swizzed as wik
After the fact that he had to just sip, just dip[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Early morning riser reefer chiefer
You paid the most but me, I get it cheaper
Strong rapper reefer, wrap it in a big cohiba
I get so high I close my eyes and swore that I saw Jesus
I take another toke and God damn I feel comatose
I double cup and that's what's up and then I'm leaning fool
I'm talking any given Sunday, Willie Beamen ho
My bitch say that I get too high it might kill my brain
I tell her that she talk too much and she should give some brain
We used to fuck a lot but now you just fuss and complain
What a fuckin' shame, hit the door and hit the block
Avoid the walking dead, the zombies still hunt and rob
My days of wasting time, slanging dimes is way behind
I'm still tryna be a mover with a Mason's mind
I will get a mil, ain't nobody taking mine
You sorry suckers, see you saps at the finish line
You know I steady grind

[Hook: SL Jones]
I stay higher than Messiah, I ain't never grinding
You see them Jewel runners coming, but we body body
We bout that LPP we diggin' other people's pockets
Keep it cool, Run the Jewels, ain't no other way around it
I want the rings and the chains, Run the Jewels
I want the watches and the bracelets, Run the Jewels
We at the table eating everybody food
Invasion of the chain snatchers better not bust a move

[Verse 2: El-P]
I’m a dummy I’m running with more than fucking scissors
I’m the Cadillac, of fuck you, back off me you bitches
You the Cadillac of “Fuck, I just suck at this rap shit"
I’m the Cadillac of "Suck it, I’m fucking disastrous"
We the Hardy and Thom of the plant a bomb game
The lead em all to the mall and set ‘em off game
You wanna hang like Hussein
Eat a mile of my shit then put your lips to my true brain
And get the hash tag #fartnoise
I used to give a half-fuck, now I just laugh
I barely blink when it gets bad, maybe I’m crass
I pull the ducts out my eyes, I don’t cry, I just can't
Killer Mike brought the fire pack
Light it off the sinners of the city where the riots at
The living fuck boy eraser
Carve initials in the wet cement right where you died at

[Hook: SL Jones]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Who wanna run a summer with the jewel runners?
Got your girlfriend hotter than two summers
Everybody tough til they see them two's on em
Then they do a number two in they True Religions
"Lord please don't shoot!", they get too religious
Truth is we go vicious on these stool pigeons
Pistol pointed at they missus like I killed these bitches
We Run the Jewels and when we talking pimpin', pay attention

[Verse 4: El-P]
Run the Jewels we a bit odd
We bad news, you barely get a fat chance to slim odds
You barely get a short plank for long walks, taught like a sawn-off
No laws when I taught, nah
And I'm kalashnikov spitting
We always take the time to smell the rose when it wither
I'd say better luck tomorrow
But the horror of your life is me and Mike are just beginning[Intro: Zack De La Rocha]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them
Fuck the slow mo

[Verse 1: Killer Mike (El-P)]
Fashion slave, you protestin' to get in a fuckin' look book
Everything I scribble's like an anarchist's cookbook
(Look good, posin' in the centerfold of Crook Book)
Black on black on black with the ski mask, that is my crook look
How you like my stylin' bruh? ain't nobody smilin' bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh
Where my thuggers and my crippers and my blooders and my brothers?
When you niggas gon' unite and kill the police, mothafuckas?
And take over a jail, give them COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur, goddamn I love the smell
Now get to pillow torchin', where the fuck the warden?
And when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him
We killin' them for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em

[Verse 2: El-P (Killer Mike)]
We out a order, your honor, you're out a order
This whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a clip wig synonym livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian, I'm fucked from the jump
I wear my Yankee so tilted I actually walk with a hunch
Look at Mikey, I think he likey, we are sinister sons
(And we the type to greet the preacher with a grin and a gun)

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them

[Verse 3: El-P (Killer Mike)]
A wise man once said, ("We all dead, fuck it")
Just spit it disgustin' youngin' and hold your nuts while you gunnin'
I listened, tatted the sentence on my dick last summer
Now I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin', waitin' for the christenin'
I know the neighbors can't help but listen in
A dirty boy who come down on the side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison
The only solace I have is the act of conjugal visiting

[Verse 4: Killer Mike (El-P)]
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Though mainly missin' my missus, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is given vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers and slavers of men and women
Including members of clergy that rule on you through religion
(He'll strip your kids to the nude and then tell 'em God will forgive 'em)

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha]

[Verse 5: Zack De La Rocha]
It's De La on the cut,lifting six on your snitching crew
I'm miles ahead of you, you can sip my bitches brew
My battle status is burning mansions from Dallas to Malibu
Check my résumé, your residence is residue
Call her a skin job and my honey dip will backflip for you
You playin' God, your eye sockets she gon' rip into
We sick of bleeding now trey spray and victim you
Done dyin', Phillip AK Dick in you
With clips in the bottom, we dipping through Gotham
Yes eclipsed by the shadows, a dark dance to the coffin
I'm a fellow with melanin, suspect of a felony
Rip like Rakim Allah, feds be checkin' my melody
Yes aggressively testin' with bunk stretches and penalties
Dump cases when facing to cop pleas when we seizing the pump
With reason to dump on you global grand dragons
Still piling fast bucks, Afghani toe taggin'
Know they trackin' me cause we bustin' back, see
The only thing that close quicker than our caskets be the factories

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Down with the shame
Down with the shame
Used to walk traps in the rain with cocaine
Used to write raps in the traps as I sat in the rain and I prayed that God give me a lane
Give me a lane
Give me the fame
Give me the fame and I promise to change
Won’t be the same
Won’t be the same type of man that puts cocaine in this lady’s hand
Heard she was pregnant, I’m guilty I reckon cause I hear that good shit can hurt baby’s brain
Heard he was normal 'til three and then he stopped talkin'
Since then, ain’t nothin been the same
Seen her some years later out in Decatur told her I’m sorry for causin' her pain
Causin' me pain?
Causin' me pain?
She asked again and then grabbed my right hand
Asked am I crazy, said look here, baby, I release you from all of your sins and your shame
Cause I’ve been redeemed
I found in Christ
Whatever it take I hope you find it, Mike
The look on her face shown that glory replaced all the shame and the hate and that she wears a crown
My late grandma Bettie had prayed with her heavy and told her to tell me lay my burdens down

[Hook: Killer Mike]
Can't pick up no crown, holding
What's holding you down
Can't pick up no crown, holding
What's holding you down
Can't pick up no crown, can't pick up no crown

[Verse 2: El-P (Killer Mike)]
(Down with the shame
Down with the shame)
Carried the flag in some other men's name
Loaded my weapon and swore to them vengeance and stepped with aggression right into the fray
Into the haze
Into the murk
Told me to prove to them what I was worth
We’ll teach you to move without mercy and give you the tools to go after the causers of hurt
You'll become death
You will take breath
This is for everything you’ve ever loved
Use all the pain that you’ve felt in your life as the currency go out and trade it for blood
You are not you
You are now us
We are the only ones that you can trust
You’ll become fear
They’ll become dust
Before this moment you didn't mean much
You are the smoldering vessel of punishment born to do nothing but justify us
Give us your empathy we’ll give you lust
Let yourself go my son time to grow up
Give up your childish obsession with questioning
Anything we don't tell you is irrelevant
Everything you've ever been is replaced by the metal and fire of the weapon you clutch

[Hook: Killer Mike][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Cops in the ghetto they move like the Gestapo
Drunk off their power and greed, they often hostile
My little homie talked shit back and they beat him bad
That boy in the hospital now he's lookin' bad
And I'm with his mom and dad, we lookin' sad
My own mama called me, said "Baby, I'm just glad
They ain't put they hands on my child and kill his ass
Please don't rap about that shit 'fore they murder your black ass"
It's drones over Brooklyn, you blink you could get took-en
And now you're understanding the definition of "Crooklyn"
Pigs on parade but bacon fryin' and cookin'
Cause kids tired of dying and walkin' round like they shook-en
Cause we smoke sour to deal with the paranoia
That they charge by the hour, can't hire the Jewish lawyer
Cause if you ain't Jigga or Puff, you doing time
And even then, you might get ten, word to Shyne

[Hook]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Do dope, fuck hope
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey-hey)
Do dope, fuck hope

[Verse 2: El-P]
You don't wanna look into my big crystal balls, suck the future
We'll moonwalk through flames with a brain on stupid
Camouflage toughies'll touch your tufts roughly
Fluff your flat permanent, lump you up ruthless
Then laugh while you're humming the tune of bruised movements
That took a few too many tabs to prove lucid
(Everything compute?) Nah the truth is too tangled
And even a satellite sees at one angle
Burners radiate smoke 'til all's motionless
Hope? Nah, ha ha, slow down with the jokin' shit
So inappropriate, right behind your ears is a what?
Look: ta-dah! The sound of your hopelessness
I can feel it too, from the ground rising up in us
Right above the clouds there's a shroud there to smother us
Make a sane man walk around with a blunderbuss
Peel another round, make a sound that is thunderous

[Hook][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
It be feelin' like the life that I’m livin' man out of control
Like every day I’m in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine’s the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask “why you’re here?”
I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that’s what it is
He chimed “you got a dime?
I said “Man, I’m tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don’t lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife
Man, I ain’t got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
Cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son”
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said “shut up”
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and
Put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk
And hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
Cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

[Hook: Boots]
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this way, feeling this way
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Feeling this, feeling this early
Early (x4)

[Verse 2: El-P]
It be feelin' like the life that I’m living man, I don’t control
Cause every day I’m in a fight for my soul
All hands below, high seas in a rickety boat
Smoke o’s so the kid might cope
You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don’t pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y’all
That the true truth’s truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth’s truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording
But didn’t record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched cop make girl bleed
Go to home, go to sleep, up again early

[Hook][Verse 1: El-P]
Penny ante your bets up
Any sanity left (nah)
Any chance for humanity's landing on who's the next up
Hope we handed 'em ammo enough to work from the neck up
Those who handling damage control don't wish us the best luck
I'm a living in smoke type
Floating with a grin over the moat type
Harry Allen on you bitch, I believe no hype
Closer to the edge than even we want to admit
If this don't go right
Then assholes like myself are proven so right
All I got is this rap shit
All I want is a castle
And to move like a man with a minimum of harassment
The company of women with opinions and fat asses
That's my list of demands
You don't answer them, get the Gatling

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I'm stuck in a time capsule
When rap was actually factual
Meanest shit you spit might cause killers to come and clap at you
Stupid, goofy, stooly
The gooch in Gucci will slap you
And that go for the cop kissing cats that's in the back of you
They all sweet as Little Richard damn
Good God al-Molly
It make a nigga like me go "Woo!" and rob the party
I exit stepping with my weapon with the Jefferson walk
If you expressing any objections you can get left in chalk
So my suggestion's let a G be
Forgive my transgressions
Or I'mma be in Catholic confessions professing depression
I'm chin checking, chill stressing, on your button I'm pressing
Mike'll fuck a rapper's life up like Mo'Nique did to Precious

[Hook]
You know I...
Get it

[Verse 3: El-P]
My name is Jaime Meline
I'm not chasing the green, I'm taking it
Bosses don't change a thing in the name of seemingly making it
Servants'll kiss the ring of whoever they think is paying 'em
You don't deserve the spit that they hurdled up in your face and shit

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
My name is Michael Render
And we are the new Avengers
We're here to tell you all your false idols are just pretenders
They're corporation slaves indentured to all the lenders
So even if you got seven figures, you still a nigga

[Verse 5: El-P]
Some men aren't meant for the light to be shined on their shitty talking
Ya'll better off trying to hide like the yay in a little pocket
We're overly fucking awesome
They watch and adopt our concepts
They squawk at the Run the Jewels squad
We skin 'em then cop a coffin

[Hook]In 2012 Killer Mike’s sixth album ‘R.A.P Music’ was produced by El-P, and Killer Mike in turn guested on El-P’s ‘Cancer 4 Cure’. The two hit it off and started working together as Run The Jewels, named after a lyric in LL Cool J's 'Cheesy Rap Blues'. The self-titled LP was recorded in woody upstate New York and a studio in Brooklyn called the Space Pit before it took its rightful place as one of the most thrilling albums of the year. Killer Mike’s Atlanta baritone drawl cuts with El-P's sinewy flow in a monument to the power of synergy in rap. It's frenetic, elegant and rowdy with supporting acts from Big Boi and Prince Paul. We meet in the attic of the Ninja Tune office in South London on a autumn day so windy the leaves almost blow through the window to speak about atheism, Thatcher, feminism, body image, steak, cadence and more.

NME: So what’s Mike like on tour?

EL-P: He’s one of the best touring buddies I’ve had in my life. He has certain things that he needs and has no problem getting them.

NME: Like..?

El-P: Like marijuana on a daily basis (opens tin containing a fair few massive spliffs).

NME: What do you eat on tour?

Mike: I like steak.

El-P: He’s an American meat and potatoes dude. I’m little bit more metropolitan, I like Asian fusion

NME: What’s on your rider?

El-P: It’s not that glamorous. Lunchmeat and cheese. As long as we have the alcohol and the ice I’m usually pretty cool.

NME: Any rules on tour?

Mike: Don’t shit on the tour bus. You can’t take a shit. If you mess it up, clean it up.

El-P: Be discerning with the quality of human you bring on the bus.

Mike: Try not to smoke cigarettes. El can but nobody else.
NME: What's your process for making a track? Does El do the beats first and the words come after?

Mike: We record together in the same room. But he’s the producer so he composes after we finish recording. He takes that shit back to whatever secret dimension EL-P goes and makes it even more phenomenal. He makes life easy for a rapper.

NME: When did you first meet?

El-P and Mike point to three questions scrawled on a whiteboard that are banned from press interviews. One of the questions is: ‘Don’t ask how we feel about other artists’. I try and get around it.

NME: What drew you first to Mike?

El-P: I liked his music already. He’s a great, charismatic rapper with a lot to say. There’s not much to not like. He’s a rapper’s rapper. If you’re a hip-hop fan you will respect what Mike does. I was asked to go work with him. I flew down to Atlanta to do a couple of songs on R.A.P Music and from there we became friends.

NME: What attracted you to El-P?

Mike: I liked the way he thought as a human, the conversations he had. We really agreed on the contrasts that we had were interesting enough, so that we wanted to keep communicating. And I’m a rapper, so the fucking beats. Insane maniac beats. I watched a lot of sport. You see a quarterback throwing the fuck out the ball you want to be on that team.

NME: What kind of conversations were you having?

El-P: One day I sat him down and said, ‘I think there’s something bigger in the universe than just us’. He said ‘I know what you mean, man, I think there are other thing happening in the universe apart from just us.’

Mike: We share the same views on religion, government, humans...

El-P: We grew up at the same time, we’re the same age, same set of references and sense of humour.

Mike: The only people who may have something comparable are young people going to the military or college ‘cos you’re thrown into an experience together, you really don’t know one another and that experience bonds you in a different way. That’s a pretty good analogy right there: we went to war.

El-P: Maybe a bit overstated?

Mike: For college?

El-P: I don’t know, I didn’t go to college. We’ve worked with enough people to know when it’s cool. I think we both met at the right time ‘cos we’re at a similar place in our lives. We love doing what we do. We think we have something left to give for a long time. We’re at the point where we don’t want to do something that we’re not enjoying.
NME: You described Run The Jewels once as a ‘burst of rebellion’, yet apart from a few songs it's not an overtly political album. What are you rebelling against?

EL-P: Did I say that? Sounds like some horse-shit that I would say. Just something being raw and good-spirited is a rebellious feeling especially in the context of other vibes on other records. Sometime something can burst through that has a different energy that even if it’s not necessarily overtly about rebellion its existence is rebellious. Just us even collaborating and being from such seemingly different scenes in the music industry is rebellious and the fact that it’s working and people are enjoying it. It’s a positive rebellion. The record isn’t overtly political but we’re more complicated than that. The one-up straight-up political records have to be that. Some of them have to exist. Me and Mike have a dash of cynicism and humour and just shit-talking involved ‘cos it makes it fun for us.

It’s easier to laugh at your execution rather than beg for your life.
NME: There are a few political songs on the album and you've both displayed a social conscience in your other work. You mentioned government and religion. What particularly worries you about society?

Mike: I don’t know if it's the fear or loathing of government and religion. I can’t do anything to change religion’s 2000 year-long stronghold on the world. I can be a good man, a good human being, good friend and love people. That’s what bonds us.

El-P: In terms of political perspective we both share a legitimate love and concern for mankind. It sometimes comes out in the form of cynicism but that’s just artistic slang, it comes from a real place. We’re not overtly political rappers but we do have thoughts and ideas about what’s going on in our lives. I reserve the right to think many different things and to change my mind and to even be wrong. I’m not running for office, this is art. I don’t have to say the right thing, I just have to say something that I’m impassioned about at the moment and say it well.

NME: What are you passionate about at the moment?

El-P: I live in a constant state underneath it all of deep, deep, deep concern for all of us. It never goes away and it’s not a varying thing, it takes on a lot of different ideas.

NME: Go on..

El-P: I have empathy for the human race and I think we are in dire straits in ways that would take a long time to explain. OK, what about wars? Wars could be a good start. We could start at war and emanate to everything else we’re fucking up. But I very much like being alive and I very much love people.

NME: I heard a lecture the other day about how politicians in the States use religion more as an identity instead of for its values, in a different way to the supposed separation of the church to the state in the UK...

El-P: We were trying to do separation of church and state in the US too. It hasn’t really been followed, has it? The funny and interesting thing is that the so-called religious politicians are actually complete 100% atheists. They don’t believe in a fucking thing. That’s just a fact. The people who talk the most about God are people who are the least like God.

NME: Obama?

El-P: Absolutely.

Mike: What made you say Obama? He rarely if ever talks about religion?

NME: He’s the most famous politician in the world.

Mike: But he’s probably the most agnostic politician of them all. We don’t know what he believes.

El-P: No, we know what he says he believes.

Mike: I also know he used to wear a bow-ties and organise in Chicago which gives me the impression he’s Nation of Islam. But he’s not the one who uses religion as that evil. It’s members of the opposite party and I’m not pro any party but members of the opposite party tell you ‘We love this guy named Jesus’ and then they’ll tell you ‘Don’t have a programme and feed poor people’. Well really that’s one of the greatest thing that Jesus mandated: that you should feed the poor, visit the sick, and care for people in prison. They care about doubling prison populations and they do not want to award healthcare. My whole list of gripes about Obama has nothing to do with God.

El-P: I don’t know what religion is to these people. I don’t know what religion is. But if you’re talking about spirituality I don’t think believe any of these motherfuckers. I’m a little bit more cynical about everything. I think everyone is full of shit.

Mike: I believe whole-heartedly that there’s a grand architect but I don’t believe he wrote any of the books.

NME: It's dangerous when people say ‘I’m right, you’re wrong’.

El-P: But atheists who say ‘we’re right, you’re wrong’ are just as much of an asshole. If you’re telling anyone about an abstract concept that you’re right and they’re wrong then you’re a fucking asshole ‘cos you don’t know and they don’t know. Atheists are just as obnoxious if not more obnoxious than zealots. It’s the fucking yang of the yen of religious zealotry. I say fuck ‘em all and if you can do some good, do some good. And we’ll find out in the end.
NME: So few people are making political music and artistic statements today in music as well as literature and art. Why do you think that is?

El-P: I have a few theories. It takes a long time to change the mindset of a population. I don‘t think that that kind of music is encouraged. I think it’s discouraged and a different set of values are promoted in the music industry ‘cos the power structure got a little freaked out after the 60s. The media conglomerates that own everything have an agenda just like they do with the news. Also music has to be interesting and good to people and you’re fighting an uphill battle if you’re being lecturey.

NME: And there are so many disparate problems..

El-P: It has to be part of something bigger though for it to work. In the 60s it was valid in America and all over the world to make that type of music because everyone in the population was having this moment. You can’t just do it in a vacuum. I don’t think musicians are obliged to do anything. It’s more disturbing to me that there can be atrocities, wars and lies upon lies and constant ridiculousness and the people don’t do anything about it. They’re sitting there taking it in the ass, including me.

NME: There’s still a ton of misogyny and sexism in the music industry and as a female hip-hop fan I find it hard to stomach. Eminem and Danny Brown have been pulled up (again) on their lyrics this year..

El-P: It is your right to feel that way and I 100% respect whatever you feel about that. I don’t really work as an overall critic of music because I think it’s up to everyone to decide how they want to do that.

Mike: It’s a worthless debate because it’s never going to change. It hasn’t changed in 50 years of rock music. It hasn’t changed in 2000 years of Christianity, Judaism and Islam. It hasn’t changed in a world dominated by men on a politico-social level so I don’t understand how you expect a couple of kids from Detroit or kids from Brooklyn and Atlanta to transform the patriarchal power machine. I can’t give that shit up in 16 bars. I don’t even know how. I think that’s a question better asked to Barack Obama and the Pope. I just do drugs and rap about the women I’ve experienced who are as virtuous to me as my grandmother.

You know what helped me cure some of my misogyny? I have two daughters. My community – the black community - is rammed by women so the same questions of sexism don’t often apply to me. I can’t see women as less than or not leaders because every leader in my life first and foremost has been a woman.

El-P: That’s another thing we have in common. I was raised by women. The men in my life were either not there or not good when they were there.

Mike: I had good men in my life but the family was led by a matriarch. African-American structure is led by matriarchy not patriarchy.

NME: What was it about having daughers that influenced you?

Mike: They both constantly challenge me on what I think. I was talking to one of my daughters about wanting to be Marilyn Monroe for Halloween. I was like ‘Why would you want to be Marilyn Monroe? There’s Josephine Baker, there’s Earth Kitt, there’s who played Coffee in Jackie Brown? Pam Greer. There’s all these other beautiful black girls’. She pointed at her brother and said ‘He’s going as Michael Myers, you don’t tell him to be Malcom X or Martin Luther King’. I looked at her and said ‘Respect’. Later we had a conversation and I asked her about her obsession with Marilyn Monroe. I felt like it’s a media thing and a brand. And she said ‘Did you know Marilyn Monroe was the first model over 155 pounds?’ I thought ‘Oh shit!’. My daughter’s short and curvy and it was important to her that she identified with someone unlike the waif models in the magazine. She’s smart enough and she figured it out.

NME: You don’t sound hopeless. What about the lyric ‘Do Dope Fuck Hope?’ Is that a mantra?

Mike: It’s a satire.

El-P: It’s an important message to the kids.

Mike: That’s what you get when you turn on your television every day. I remember when there were only three medicine commercials on TV: aspirin, what ever for back pain and feminine hygiene. Now if you turn your TV on you’re sold 10 medicines before you turn off. I’m not telling you ‘do dope fuck hope’, they’re telling you ‘do dope fuck hope’.

El-P: It’s a multilayered joke. It’s half tongue in cheek and it’s half an admittance of an attitude. Sometimes you can’t cope with shit so you smoke or drink something. We are not like self-righteous people. We’re kind of fucked up and that’s a part of our personality. One of things we agree on are that we like to tune out ‘cos we’re too tuned in. That’s why we do drugs. We’re crazy because we’re artists. Artists are unfortunately a bit too tuned into things and it affects us so we run out and go crazy because we have to.

NME: You’ve talked a lot about the influence of EPMD. Though you’re different to Gang Starr, or Erik B & Rakim because you’re both rapping, do you feel like you’re part of that rap duo lineage?

Mike: That’s my aspiration. UGK, Biz and A.G, OutKast, EPMD, Dead Prez… We gotta be there. I see my career now as 2012 having dropped the illest rap record and 2013 having dropped the illest duo rap record. That’s history. If I wanted to be in the hall of fame it’s as a solo artist and a group member.

El-P: I don’t wanna be in the hall of fame at all. I want Mike to be in there though. I started my career in a group which was 100% all about being a part of that legacy. We wanna do that lineage justice and that’s why we’re trying to make it a real group and really create together.

NME: Musically, lyrically have you’ve pulled something out of each other that wasn’t there before?

El-P: We’re a good balance. When we’re alone we‘re being our intense selves and when we’re together we’re finding the points on the graph where our ideas cross and our styles mix and it’s just another thing.

Mike: I’m inspired by his focus.

El-P: Our flow’s changed. We’re bouncing off each other and it’s creating a hybrid of our flows. There’s some more middle ground in the way we’re approaching shit. We are allowing each other to play with each other’s style and you have to be really a fan of the person to do that. We’re both so technically proficient and we’re having a helluva lot of fun flipping that. Run The Jewels flows are not the same as 'Cancer 4 Cure' and 'R.A.P Music' flows. It’s a third thing.

NME: What's the difference?

El-P: We’re playing with cadence more, it’s more of a bop. We’re playing off each other more. If Mike does something in a pattern and I’m coming after him I want to make what I do complement him. I’m going to come up with some hybrid to bridge it. It’s like musicians playing together. You can sit in front of an audience with a guitar and play a solo but you sit in with a jazz band and you improvise you’re going to have to see what they do.

NME: You gave the album away for free. Was that a reaction against the music industry?

El-P: It wasn’t against anything. It was for the music fans. We just thought it would be a cool thing to do. We gave the record away because we wanted to thanks the fans for giving us some real love. Saying we want you guys in. Here’s our contribution to this ongoing relationship if it moves us to go to a show and buy something for us or support us or even just share the music with somebody then that’s great.

~~~~~~~

NME: When you played in London this week you spoke about Margaret Thatcher. What was that about?

Mike: It wasn’t me. I said I'd tripped the fuck out when I first did 'Reagan' here. Kids starting shouting ‘Die Maggie Die’ and I didn’t know who Maggie was. I had no idea what people were talking about and then a few months later she died and then I got really freaked out like 'What the fuck?!' Because I wasn’t as learned on global conservativism. I knew she knew Reagan but I didn’t realise they were cronies. Working class people the world over despised those two. I was doing Reagan as a kid who grew up in America but these kids who grew up in the UK felt the same way. The feeling I had for Reagan and his regime somehow mirrored their feelings and thoughts for her.

NME: So what’s next?

El-P: We’re already writing part two of Run The Jewels and it’ll definitely be out next year.

The European release of Run The Jewels is out January 13 on Big Dada[Intro: Killer Mike]
I'm gonna bang this bitch the fuck out!
You better -- You might wanna record the way you feeling like history being made
This muthafucka put a mirror on the goddamn screen
Let's go, El-P!
Huh? Champ! So what we're gonna do next?

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I'm up at midnight, I'm dippin' off in my Nizzikes
A gun and a metal pizzipe, a knizzife is to my rizzight
I'm lurkin' servin' on pussies who lack a purpose
I've got 'em filled up with frizzight like Mizzike is you all rizzight?
I'm lookin' lurkin' on bitches twerkin' for service
The bitches bag is a Birkin, I'm yellin' screamin' and cursin'
I'm putting pistols in faces at random places like
Bitch give it up or stand adjacent to Satan
Bad man chillin', the villains is here
No Jesuses here, I hear the demons in my ear
And I want it, I need it, see it, I take it
Never fake it, wrap you motherfuckers up, leave you naked
The jewel runners, top tag team for two summers
Live and let live, fuck you cuz cause that's a fool's honor
I'm walkin' totin' on two llamas
You niggas ass and trash and trash, fuck it, I'm too honest
So fuck you fuckboys forever, I hope I said it politely
And that's about the psyche of Jaime and Mikey
You meet another pair better - highly unlikely
And if I can't rap, then maggot fuck, then fight me
I live for the thrill of the kill, yes it excites me
You know your favorite rapper ain't shit and me, I might be
The closest representation of God you might see
Pay honors like your momma young sonna and take a right knee
The passion of Pac, the depth of Nas, circa nine three
Mix the mind of Brad Jordan and Chuck D and find me
I spit with the diction of Malcolm or say a Bun B
Prevail through Hell, so Satan get ye behind me

(Run the Jewels)

[Verse 2: El-P]
I've never been much of shit, by most measurements don't exist on the radar a little blip in the shadow of motherships
Been smothered and brashly muffled by hucksters of global spin like the sign on my back says "stab me", my soul is your little bitch
But maybe you should be careful when flipping a stranger's switch like assuming the war is won ain't a symptom of arrogance
When nothing to lose a step up then everything's for the win so we grin in the face of frauds and tell monsters to suck our dick
I live to spit on your grave, my existence is to disgrace you
The kitten became a lion that look at your face like great food
That's why we got the people behind us
While other rappers are vaginas for the fame the jewel runners will always stay rude
Motherfuck your permission
Was never yours to begin with
And every bar of the bitch shit you spit is your fucking prison
I been here making raw shit and never asked to be lauded
Run the Jewels is the answer, your question is "what's poppin'?"[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Killer Mike and El-P
Fuck boys know the combination ain't healthy
Tell me if you smell the
Marijuana hanging off my breath
Blowing smoke and I'm coughing like I'm damn near death
If I died right now I would be so fresh to death
They would have to say "That fat motherfucker coffin fresh
God damn fat bastard, where that motherfucker's casket?"
But naw baby you gon' get this here vertical
Every word murderful
Surgical, painful, purposeful
And I'm taking left off your fuck list personal
Woo, they done let that fuckin' Mike out
It's like Tyson in the '80s, nigga snap and punch your lights out
It's like Tyson in the '90s, if I'm losing take a bite out
I'm so motherfuckin' grimy
So mutherfuckin' greedy, gritty
Mama said she couldn't breast feed cause I was bitin' at the titty
(Beast)

[Hook: Until The Ribbon Breaks]
So I think we've burned our bridges, but it's difficult to tell
I've been walking through the ashes, saying "didn't we do well?"
So I think we'll have to pay for this, but I'm not afraid of hell
I've been walking through the ashes, saying "didn't we do well?"

[Verse 2: El-P]
Killer Mike and El-P, fuck boys think about it
Fuck you gonna sell me, you don't know a thing about us
Women dosed with ayahuasca drum circle and sing about us
Dolphins prone to rape'll hear the tape and start to think about it
Monks won't immolate themselves until the record hits the shelves
Yetis walk right out the woods to cop it without thinkin' bout it
Workers at the sweatshop kill they boss to how the vets drop
Worker ants surround their queen and chew the bitch's head off
Drug dogs bark at the tour bus when it park
Priests take the cock out of their mouths to hum along when the chorus drop
At the least we are the most beef and broc on your fuckin' block
The bass make a whale off of the coast scream "Ya'll gotta stop!"
Used to be the new kid 'till I grew into that new shit
Emperors that hear the tunes admit that they are nudists
Move, we coming through 'em, we are ruthless
Mama said I wouldn't leave the womb without a Yankee and some new kicks

[Hook: Until The Ribbon Breaks][Verse 1: El-P]
Smoke from the loosie drift
Hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of bein' excellent the median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold
Authorities have spoken, demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground while the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano, y'all know, kinda bat shit
The bright lights of fuckery stuck in me automatic
I’ll tea bag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who’ll swim like directly after he's eaten
While holding a toaster oven that's plugged with a fork in it
Cause death by electrocution's like life in New York, isn't it?
Shoulda been a dentist, mom said it
Pain's the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors that I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop I can chop it up with exacto touch
Whats the rush?
Autograph skin flaps, tag em up
I don't brag enough you de facto suck
A lotta you new to the El Producto milieu
Kinda like “fuck is you?”
I'm a little black spot on a sun of lies
But I'm not too high to say I'm the truth
I line the booth to catch blood like a Bateman
Nothing sacred I’ll mace a play pen
Jewel runner bitch make the name stick
Not for sale but I'm takin payments

[Hook: Killer Mike]
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
(Everybody's doin’ it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
Everybody doin’ it
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
(Everybody's doin’ it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I’m fly as a pegasus, that’s no embellishment
I’m here to pain the whole game, where the Excedrin
Good pussy, good marijuana that be my medicine
And I’m a mixture of MJG and the Weathermen
A revolutionary bangin' on my adversaries
And I love Dr. King but violence might be necessary
Cause when you live on MLK and it gets very scary
You might have to pull your AK, send one to the cemetery
We overworked, underpaid, and we underprivileged
They love us, they love us (why?)
Because we feed the village
You really made it or just became a prisoner of privilege?
You willing to share that information that you’ve been given?
Like who really run this?
Like who really run that man that say he run this?
Who who really run that man that say he run this
Run run run run this?
Like who really fund this?
Like who really fund who say he fund this?
Like who in the world gon' tell Donald Sterl who to put on the “you can’t come” list?
Now don’t be silly
Who the fuck gon' bully me if I got a billi?
If I got a billi and the bitch recording me I’m like who cares
What I wouldn’t be is on TV stutterin' ta-ta-talkin' scared
So the question is when Don’s at home with that traitor ass bitch alone
Who’s that voice on the side of the phone that shakes and rattles his bones?
Could it be the man behind the man behind the man behind the throne?
Gone

[Hook]

Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Reminiscin-in' on our time of innocence
When we drank that Hennessy, ate on lamb and venison
Face fucked you in your kitchenette, fucked you like we tusslin'
Do you fuck your husb-al-and? Like, do y'all be tusslin'?
Do you wear the muzzlin'? Do you ask him pretty please?
Do you crawl on hands and knees, like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl, the world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else, I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this, pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin', I think I'm in love again
Found my perfect drug again, feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance, 2 Live Crew the narrative
And there it is

[Hook: Killer Mike & Gangsta Boo]
I put that dick in her mouth all day
She got that (dick in her mouth all day)
She take that (dick in her mouth all day)
(She said she wanted my, wanted my)
Dick in her mouth all day, day
I give her that (dick in her mouth all day)
She play with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She want that (dick in her mouth all day)
I think I'm in love again (Love again)

[Verse 2: El-P]
Here I am, my love
Just like when we first hooked up
Feeling like I'm animal
Feeling like you're edible
Bendable
I been away
I don't have too much to say
You say say it anyway
I say take your shit off I'm not playing bae
You little freak
What you are is so unique
Smart and full of filth and joy
You been with some little boys
Now you're with a grown-up man
One who'll actually understands
Kid gloves are not on my hands
I will never condescend
Now spread yourself
She smiled a bit
Gripped the outline of my shit
Oh, my god, I love this chick
I must put my tongue in this
Into every space I go
Give me everything you am
She said, "No, you gimme first"
That was like a day ago
8 AM
She still got my

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
That's what you want huh?
Well let me tell you a little story
I had a young player from the hood
Lick my pussy real good
Kept me stuck with lots of wood
Kept my bank account on swoll
Sniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro
Made a porn tape, that nigga is a pro, you ain't know?
He had a lot of bad bitches in his past
But I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man
His tongue is bomb
And he love for me to ride his face
Front to back, grippin' ass
Pay my bills, where I live, fuck me good
Broke ass niggas killing me
I'm about my money, ho
Never been a square bitch
He ain't paying? Hit the fuckin' door
Talking slick, that Memphis shit
I be from that Haven click
Keep it ratchet so sweet
All these boys kiss my feet
I be on that queen shit
You better bless my realness
Stick your tongue up in my ass
You better show me who you fuckin' with
Run The Jewels
Love again, you gon' lose, I'm gon' win
Let's have an orgy
I'mma share your ass with all my friends (Yeah, ho!)

[Hook 2: Gangsta Boo]
He want this clit in his mouth all day
He want this clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I've got this I've got this fool in love again (Yeah ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I put my clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
He want this clit in his mouth all day
I've got this fool in love again (Love again)[Narrator]
