[Sparks]
That's deep uhh
This some of that get you through your day music that's right
I want ya'll to ride with me

[Hook: repeat 4X]
If if if if if if if if if
If I could do it all again I promise you I would do it different

[Sparks]
If I could turn back the hands of time
I swear I'd go back to spendin a little more time with my grandmom
I remember her smile just like it was yesterday
And her tellin me "kid stay away from the knuckleheads"
But me being a hardhead I'd run to the block anyway
Me and D'bo forty-drinkin', weed-smokin', servin' fiends til the mornin'
Coming home young and restless
Grandma downstairs waiting watchin' the Young & Restless
Soap opera's smilin' happy to see me
Still in one piece deep down she worried bout me
But I'm too young, dumb, and blind to see
They say you don't miss your water until your well run dry
My grandma died man I cried so hard
I swear if I could turn the hands of time I'd to it all over again
I'd been there right by her bed in Mesricordia hospital I swear, yeah

[Hook]

[Sparks]
Flatline here comes the doctor I see my momma break down my god
Now I done seen tears fall from the face of a hustla
But screams from my mom sent pain through my spine
So I got to embrace her
I scream momma were all gonna miss nana but you got to get yourself together
Stand strong for her o.k. momma I gotcha
Doctor screaming uh-ha there's nothing else we can do for her
Past hours up with family members bringing balloons and flowers
Sign this signature we all goin miss you grandmama
My nieces and nephews they standing and they confused
Want to know why everyone's crying
I tell em' grandmother's gone away
And she gonna be gone for a long time o.k
And where she's gone it's a better place
You know blue skies white clouds now go and play with Kensache o.k

[Hook]

[Oschino]
If I could do it again, I would do it different
Less time spent in prison, more time in religion
Less time talking more time listening
Learning observing went to school fucked around and been a surgeon
But the hands of time do not go back
And all my niggas in the dirt in the box they will not come back
Rest in peace Mark, Troy, Ant, Schiz, Mann, Wayne, Rob
All the young niggas who died before they time
From a place where you deal with the blues
Been shot more than Pac but I ain't make the news
Walk with me, if I could do it again
I can't so I deal with the past
Like Texas inmates deal with the gas
If I die it's no surprise if it's not from old age
But from a young angry nigga with an old gauge
The ghetto motherfucker times is mean
We'd love to have Michael J. Fox time machine

[Hook][Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In other words, he shall live but die you must
Instill your faith in ever whom thy trust
Instill your faith, get crushed my a man like such
Don't let them niggas gas you up like Sig is, but
Sig the shit, but far from ass
Stop the blood clot crying, the pain shall pass
But for now meet the reaper and feel thy rath
Green as the grass shall be on the other side
Another lie told to you by old blue eyes
Blue is the color of deception, so my recollection
Now you're lost with no direction
I'm a stand up man, I stand on my own two, firm
Why fool never learn? Play with fire, get burned
But my word you don't trust it, now it's too late once you touch it

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
Uh, Young C, SP, yo
I love my niggas for life, ain't no doubt about that
My nigga Free, nigga Crack, throw a shout for Mac
Oschino and Sparks, them niggas my heart
(insert lyric) Kept them one hundred from the start
HOV prop, we was fresh off the block, like what?
Came at Nas, came at the locks, ain't give a fuck
Whoever came at big homie had a problem with us
See we was all we knew, in Roc-a-fella we trust
Now this bullshit split up, fucked the whole shit up
Knocked us back to scratch, how the fuck we get back to that
Niggas need you big homie, gotta get back to rap
I mean, facts is facts, 16 you had my back
Now we back corner to corner, niggas laugh at that
Seeing me firing the streets, how you ain't mad at that?
Let alone niggas plan my demise, tough love
Big homie you ain't stand by my side. How can I (run to the ROC)

[Verse 3: Omillio Sparks]
It's death before dishonor and I'm a fucking rider
Flicking my middle finger to all the corporate liars
Juelz can feel the fire, cause he's a fucking traitor
I'm far from a hater, I never been a liar
My fucking youngest riding, it's like they let us suffer
Making they skins thicker, making they circle tighter
And they ain't relying on us, to get them out the gutter
See what I want for myself, I want for my brothers
Calm as a mother fucker, and ya'll some fronting niggas
I'm trying to feed my babies, ya'll trying to starve my siblings
I ain't received the cheques since my boy Mac was sentenced
Law sent us back, what's your personal business
Now we back in the trenches in this hurting position
Imagine me in the kitchen somewhere working the dishes
You get your wish if you ever planned my demise
Tough love, big homie you ain't stand by my side, how can I (run to the ROC)[Freeway]
Za-za za-za-za za-za

[Omillio Sparks]
I gotta snap on this one daddy!!

[Peedi Crakk]
Oh! Now clap for me mami...
Just clap for me mami...

[Freeway]
I know a little bit
I only know the dirty words...

[Peedi Crakk]
Holla at yo fuckin dog!
No benz, No ice, just me in the hooptie
Holdin the toolie, everything calm and cooly
Got all these chicks tryin to screw me
Gimmie the coochie, sperm runnin all down her Guccis
Alot changed since smoke in the crime
Holdin my mama in the court sayin "Fuck you ya honor!"
Fitted, fresh, jersey as well
Rocafella Nam'sayin on my black and white shells
In too deep, niggas still got beef
Still smack you wit the heat, in the middle of the streets
Still, wearin my best wit a fresh white tee
Four-pound, two-clips, hollow tips gone skeet you
So sweet, that I don't lose no sleep
Miss no meals, this guy eats without no deal
Drink liquor like a pirate tongue, slick as a sailor
High like a pilot shirt, foot like a seller, whoa!!
Drinkin liquor gettin' brain in my waterbed
Feelin' like a skylark next to your daughter head
Oh I forgot, bigga nigga probably bought her here
Got her drunk, talkin all the shit a whore wanna hear
I just, fuck em', buck em' wit the lights on
Let her know it's nuthin, crush em' wit my night saw
Bout to get my flight on, charter or train
Pardon the name, but Crakk is just a part of the game
Far as the change, just bustin' my checks
Duckin my ex, gettin' shermed up in the Lex
Now how the fuck you get all that??

[Chrous repeat 2x]
Ring the alarm!
Another hater's dying
Oh boy, aye!

Ring the alarm!
When my gauge is firing
Cock back, dump on
You and your moms

[Omillio Sparks]
You cocksucker's got hate in ya blood
Y'all ain't happy that sparks got the cocked desi-eagle in yo mug
I rock, like MTV unplugged
Let the M-1 rock one of you fucks
I gives a fuck about who catches a slug or who tells
Cuz the kid got money for bail and if they get out give a fuck who out
Pricks still talkin measly, still talkin greasy
The "ROC" is rocked up and sold out
Y'all can't sell, and y'all won't be seen like an NFL blackout
My guns go "Blakow!"
Don't make me put the cocked nine right in front of yo eyes
And make y'all fucks cock-eyed...(Woman speaking spanish)
Who the fuck can fuck wit B. Sieg, Free and Omillio?
You young boys back up, while the trucks back out
When the "ROC" enters the building your best bet is get the fuck out
I bring clappers, get yo boys clapped up, fucker! (R-O-C..) Holla!

[Hook 2x]

[Freeway]
Freeway bust shots, it don't matter who
Can't even hug the block if I'm mad at you
Takin turns comin thru that's what my niggas do
Takin' turns inside yo chick that's what my click will do
Dark room, Cancun, spanish interview
Wit mamacita, Freeway, charmed to meet you
All, damn day I got some dick for her
No, way I never got no chips for her
Any day of the week, long-gun tucked every day of the week
Freak Nia Long lookin honey just about any day of the week
Guest ran thru sleep, got young niggas willing to grind
On your block wit a package of sweet
Cuz Free not stuck up
See me anywhere, won't get stuck up
Keep the heavy-hand, miss take that off
Toss them underwear, who those? my balls
Come from under there
Freeway, a boss don't you wanna stare?
Haters, get lost don't you understand?
Shit spit, be real don't you see these guns?
Fuck the, ice grill don't you see these dudes?
We from the ghetto, and they don't like our attitude
Mami say I'm loco, she don't like my attitude (Holla!)

[Hook 2x][Intro]
[Female Singing] You don't know
[Freeway - talking] Whoo..on the grind, uh, so gangsta, don't ya agree? uh
[Female Singing] You don't know
[Freeway - talking] This just in case y'all dunno how it go down in the hood
Freeweezy here to break it down to ya

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
Tryna to survive in the hood everyday
Takes, everything you work with
Everything you got quick
From the cops wyle off the product
Show em what helped alot but I can't get it
I hugged the block, light an L
Let my man hit it and ran with it
Sell it nixed to the pops
Hate to tell ya if he don't get it from me
Then he gon get it somewhere else
Sometimes I would if I was somewhere else
Me and my man on the corner with two crates
Picture us rollin, somewhere else
Pretendin to be pushin the V's
Then two fiends walked up to me
Brought me back to reality
He want three and he want five
But my packed stash (why) cuz the cops act like I'm Lil' Cease
Crush on me, keep rollin by
Tryna to put the cuffs on my black ass literally

[Hook - Freeway] + (Female Singing)
(You don't know)
How it is in the hood so Freeway bring the hood to your front porch
My niggas duck court pour weed in the woods
Set up shop and move rocks on the front step
(You don't know)
How it is in the ghetto the tech blow hear shots echo
We can't let go, stuck on the block
Stuck in the hood, street niggas up to no good

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
No rules, no trees just alot in the push
My ? in the house, read my mouth
Fuck the D's got a pocket to push
Send fleas in the opposite way
Quarter to one guess I stop at the chinks
Grab me a grub, count up the profit I made
Rule number one
Sell your first stack and cop you a gun
We hear gun shots, we hardly amazed
My man Willie Mays and Santana live on the run
What does it mean? not goin back
Not gettin caged, strong with a gat
Prepare for the raid
Listen Mothers, bodies still underaged
You better talk to your sons
Send em on a straight line from the lines
And move straight to the pen
Sleep with a blade, husky niggas touchin they chin
Get bailed, get out and then they at it again
All for the love of the pay

[Hook - Freeway] + (Female Singing)
(You don't know)
How it is in the hood so Freeway bring the hood to your front porch

We can't let go, stuck on the block
Stuck in the hood, street niggas up to no good

[Verse 3 - O. Sparks]
Every since I don't stop waist side
Sparks had the ambition to ride
O. Town play games but I need this chain
Got me deep in the game
To the point, yea coulnd't get no rest, no sleep
All I did was hug the block
And shake the police while they shakin the bag
At age 18, like half a brick, crack got half the street
Most of my always call me "Snoop"
Cause I couldn't cook this shit then
So I brought all my worst stylin fiends
Runnin back to the kid like "Sparks man, you sold me some bullshit"
But I kept on pumpin cause the block kept on jumpin
I'm not stoppin, I was told the sky's the limit
Plus I'm tryna to push the roads
And park the ?????
And let you know what exactly takes places in the ghetto
When techs blow
When the cops circle, I know the bells like ?
Run fast with that .38 special

[Hook - Freeway] + (Female Singing)
(You don't know)
How it is in the hood so Freeway bring the hood to your front porch

Stuck in the hood, street niggas up to no good
(You don't know)[Intro - Omillio Sparks - talking] (Freeway)
(I need some fuckin money, man)
I feel you Free
Goin through this recession and shit
Now them hoes actin up
Bills keep comin in, shit, focus

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
I used to get money from slingin the dope
But since they cracked down on that dope slingin, I'm broke
And I used to get money from slingin the crack
But since they cracked down on that crack slingin, I'm cracked
I used to get it there, expert at bringin 'em back
But now it ain't no packages to get there
Prior to that I was fillin apps
A few years before that was in the Barbershop sweepin hair
Little Barbershop sweeper kid, cop a hustle
Was sellin incense and oils to all the people there
Sixth, seventh and eighth grade I kept a couple
Dollars for work and fresh sneakers, I was hurtin 'em
Yep, now it's a recession and I'm stressin
I need it for lesser, I'm not tryin to be a working man
I'm sure not tryin to do carpentry like my pops
Big pain in the bottom of his back and it be hurtin him, damn!

[Hook - Mr. Porter]
Ohhh, I close my eyes and all I can see is that money (money, money)
Money (money, money)
A list of things that my people need but first is money (money, money)
Money (money, money)
It ain't like I found a pot of gold (no)
This ain't a dream, this is reality homes
That's why my main focus is on that money (focus on the money)
Money (money, money)

[Verse 2 - Omillio Sparks]
Just broke a new broad, she wants the fancy car
A nigga stacked up a yard, she tryin to spend it all
I'm out slingin the hard and don't respect the law
Bent a few wrong corners and that, of course, involved
From C-A to D-A, they tryin to take it all
I think I need a vacation, reach out through calling cards
Or make the mind frame vicious and start a Holocaust
I figure man, what's the difference? That shit'll all a cost
Fuck it, let a nigga ball
Money, money, money
Money is my bitch, ho breed envy, I keep pourin Henny
Screamin "fuck 'em!", that's the nigga in me
Y'all ain't come from the trap or trenches with me
When cops knocked and locked me
Guns plural, serve riches to El Toros
From the projects, suburbs to the Borough
Runnin through your small town
Spit Philly game and lock it down
Focus and only here for one purpose, that is

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
Philly Free on his grind, I need my paper straight
So I'm creatin these rhymes without a paper mate
That got me bustin these lines, they got me rackin my mind
They got me standin in line behind my label mates
No, I'm not Jay but I am on the way
And I am not Kanye but I can produce +Heartbreaks & 808s+
And reduce the studio costs
Cause I'm recording in the hood, I'm not lampin in the Mandalay
I'm makin hits, I need the same attention they get
Them niggas throw a temper tantrum, you don't hand 'em pay
Record labels tryin to jerk me like a hand job
If they don't hand me mine, I know how to handle this
Leave somebody slumped, Riot Pump pistol grip
But fuck sittin in prison wastin my plans away
I guess I gotta find another way to make the pay
Let me know if you can find a way to make the chips

[Hook][Freeway]
Za-za za-za-za za-za

[Omillio Sparks]

From a place where you deal with the blues
Been shot more than Pac but I ain't make the news
Walk with me, if I could do it again
I can't so I deal with the past
Like Texas inmates deal with the gas
If I die it's no surprise if it's not from old age
But from a young angry nigga with an old gauge
The ghetto motherfucker times is mean
We'd love to have Michael J. Fox time machine

[Hook][Intro - Omillio Sparks - talking] (Freeway)
(I need some fuckin money, man)
I feel you Free
Goin through this recession and shit
Now them hoes actin up
Bills keep comin in, shit, focus

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
I used to get money from slingin the dope
But since they cracked down on that dope slingin, I'm broke
And I used to get money from slingin the crack
But since they cracked down on that crack slingin, I'm cracked
I used to get it there, expert at bringin 'em back
But now it ain't no packages to get there
Prior to that I was fillin apps
A few years before that was in the Barbershop sweepin hair
Little Barbershop sweeper kid, cop a hustle
Was sellin incense and oils to all the people there
Sixth, seventh and eighth grade I kept a couple
Dollars for work and fresh sneakers, I was hurtin 'em
Yep, now it's a recession and I'm stressin
I need it for lesser, I'm not tryin to be a working man
I'm sure not tryin to do carpentry like my pops
Big pain in the bottom of his back and it be hurtin him, damn!

[Hook - Mr. Porter]
Ohhh, I close my eyes and all I can see is that money (money, money)
Money (money, money)
A list of things that my people need but first is money (money, money)
Money (money, money)
It ain't like I found a pot of gold (no)
This ain't a dream, this is reality homes
That's why my main focus is on that money (focus on the money)
Money (money, money)

[Verse 2 - Omillio Sparks]
Just broke a new broad, she wants the fancy car
A nigga stacked up a yard, she tryin to spend it all
I'm out slingin the hard and don't respect the law
Bent a few wrong corners and that, of course, involved
From C-A to D-A, they tryin to take it all
I think I need a vacation, reach out through calling cards
Or make the mind frame vicious and start a Holocaust
I figure man, what's the difference? That shit'll all a cost
Fuck it, let a nigga ball
Money, money, money
Money is my bitch, ho breed envy, I keep pourin Henny
Screamin "fuck 'em!", that's the nigga in me
Y'all ain't come from the trap or trenches with me
When cops knocked and locked me
Guns plural, serve riches to El Toros
From the projects, suburbs to the Borough
Runnin through your small town
Spit Philly game and lock it down
Focus and only here for one purpose, that is

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
Philly Free on his grind, I need my paper straight
So I'm creatin these rhymes without a paper mate
That got me bustin these lines, they got me rackin my mind
They got me standin in line behind my label mates
No, I'm not Jay but I am on the way
And I am not Kanye but I can produce +Heartbreaks & 808s+
And reduce the studio costs
Cause I'm recording in the hood, I'm not lampin in the Mandalay
I'm makin hits, I need the same attention they get
Them niggas throw a temper tantrum, you don't hand 'em pay
Record labels tryin to jerk me like a hand job
If they don't hand me mine, I know how to handle this
Leave somebody slumped, Riot Pump pistol grip
But fuck sittin in prison wastin my plans away
I guess I gotta find another way to make the pay
Let me know if you can find a way to make the chips

[Hook]
