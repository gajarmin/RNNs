[Busdriver]
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
And to show you around imaginary places
Put money lumps in my bloody stump
And I will have a smile that's a perfect circle
Die in your sleep with the sky at your feet
I'll shoot you when you're happy, on the day that you will find peace
How do you do? I don't know I'm okay
Every person I know is a secret service agent
Because I've been accused of lewd conduct
Stole the heart of a prude prom slut
And they got the warrant for my arrest to put me in
The loony bin, the funny farm, cause of what I did

But I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
There is not a single person who can do it better
No needle skippin in my ecosystem
But in the audience may be an evil Christian
HMO how I hate him so
But they charge me for a halo
But I'm on a scavenger hunt for a lavender chunk
Of the sky, maybe I'll replace it with a mud-pie
I play dead songs on the silk screen
Buy my shirt it is a killed dream
It is known to lead the way to the stairwell
To God's administrative office and a final farewell

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
And to give your assault rifle a banana clip
Glow in the dark when I stroll in the park
Givin everybody informative pamphlets!
No sign of life for as far as I can see
Everybody's just charred meat up in the car seat
Eat shit and die to the secret spy
Cause I have a funny feeling that I'm being watched
24-hour surveillance
Money or power are ailments
But I send the medical supplies and the shipping
And the handling is way too much, cause I'm from the Afterlife

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
It's like I put a cough drop right upon your soft spot
Make Martian clothes out of your garden hose
Turn into a deadly gas blown through the air duct
She's not in love but I thought that she was
She doesn't love me because I don't have the right haircut
I misunderstood I should fix under the hood
But I will not apologize for anything that I've said
My name is Mr. Busdriver, this is the producer Paris
We are not embarrassed to admit that we will perish in
A pit of our own imaginary PLACE!

Kids...if you want to piss off your parents...
Show interest in the arts...

Kids...if you, REALLY want to piss off your parents...
Buy real estate in an Imaginary Place...oh yes...

Okay, okay, alright!
Yea...now...move!

[D-Styles cuts and scratches]

Guess I gotta do my shout outs now...
(Peace to...)

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Paris and Daddy Kev, they'll also be there too
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Unless the people of Mexican descent will help you
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Freestyle Fellowship and Abstract Rude will help you
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Chillin' Villain Empire and Hip Hop Kclan too

I'm just here to hold your hand to die...
I'm just here to hold your hand when you..
Just here to hold your hand...when you die...[Intro: Aesop Rock (Busdriver)]
Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying, but... is it sexier than torture?
(shah, yeah, Los Angles)
(Under the cellulite laden thigh of the night)
(Yeah, oh shoot, lemme see if I can finish this)
(Okay, lets go, yeah)
(We can make this better (x3))

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Under the cellulite laden thigh of the night
I slip miniature mantras between my cries and gripes
Jewel-flavored crystals in the red, blue, and white stripes
While crowds wanna resent me like The Price is Right
And downtime is never met with an overjoyed grin
Cause sleep and death have always been conjoined twins
You'd rather lick the red gills of pop art
And then your cement-filled epoch marks
The withering tendrils from my wrought heart
Reach for a Benadryl like it was a lost ark
Cause my average day is for the body of aegis, they're prompting these sieges
We cry to these seniors, living a side of splotchy Adidas
Serving consecutive sentences
My corrective lenses is ruby quartz
You're my bitch and ain't worth a jiggling of booty warts
Circumstances trap writers Kathy Bates
Under a neat colorized happy face
So my carbon covered in candy paint
There's still a namesake if it's a diaper rash
I'm pinging this on a cyber cast
Questioning news items playing pattycake with Ira Glass
The fact that this pony show's racist
Stirs the colloquial cake mix and charges the homeostasis
Of all the homies who await us like we some Smokin' Joe Fraziers
But my unchecked whining's like some ceremonial plate shift

[Hook: Busdriver]
We can make this better, or not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, or not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, or not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Before long, boil the bones
A little celery chop
A little pepper, a little milk of the poppy
Little posse in effect
Analog mono-poly Man'o'War
Walloping the auto-poly avatar
Mind on his Mallomars
Money on the iron lung
Clumsy with the can of worms
Usher you behind the sun
He shoots he whores, truly stupid troubadours and elders
Stock the shelter with frijoles and blueberry New York Seltzers
Roll up in a pa-diddle like a doofus
Hit the corner like the devil is a cubist
I'm ruthless, the sigil is dog with a cone, feeling foolish
Seven hells calling all foreseeable futures
Be an obtained culprit
Crippling migraine and strange stomach
Or a stray bullet through his gray mullet
I am ivy up the god damn lattice
March to the math rock
Raw, no cartoon mascot
The Mario pajama bottoms clumsily rappelling
Under a gibbous moon
Hunting for shitty food
Gunning, too tough, embedded in bad magic
Duckboy, shit is quacktastic

[Bridge: Busdriver]
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet

[Hook:]
We can make this better, or not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Rap Marilyn Manson, about as hot as a Vanson
With two hoodies on the beach with two bitches crump dancin'
Rappers put your bets in, last man standin'
Bars hit so hard you ricochet off the planet
The motherfucking hybrid, tell Miley Cyrus text me
When I holler to her private I'm tryna get them privates
Parts, don't start, take heart like Kano
Remember when I told to you niggas drink all the Dran-o
Pop all the pills, take all the lines
Chop through a window with some sawblade blinds
Back on that shit, guess what this time?
Half a stick of dynamite where the sun don't shine
Any nigga disrespecting, chin check 'em 'til he's slinky-neck
Blowing dope, eyes low and chinky like I'm Mannie Fresh
Countdown to extinction, no nigga not Megadeath
So many dead rappers, can't even take baby steps
Walking over carcasses of artists in my garden
Been nice with this shit since Nas was writin' past the margin
Any nigga wanna start it, I fuckin' beg your pardon
I'm with arson, I'm the firestarter; Prodigy invent the art
Smack my bitch up in the mouth with my dick
And it's not domestic violence cause she likes that shit
There's no sentence to describe it, homie
Except she sucked it like her fucking life depended on it

[Hook: Busdriver]Me me me me me me me me me me me me me

[VERSE 1]
They paint their vulva beige
Bleed a cola keg
While I plan to ruin GOP motorcades
For these senseless zines turned censored scenes
I earn a soldier's wage

So I broke your legs
Threw you rollerblades
Because you claimed that the OG was overpaid
For pointing M-16s
At grenadine
Coursing through the pollster aids

I need my water brush
In the economic crunch
The financiers are seeped in embalming slush
And the sexist machines
Express the means
To re-appeal Roe vs Wade

So I gotta demode the dark matter
On the spring-loaded park plaza
Who is in charge?
I don't know
They all eat their business cards

I'm a hack at deer shooting
Know Vladimir Putin
While I wear this cashmere pantsuit thing
I can knight the spokesman
So Ibuprofen
Becomes your golden egg

[VERSE 2]
Automated voter readytellers are the subsequent heavy seller
In the pool of undecided registry
Because they don't give a fuck about the findings on a troop surge
It's a moot point
What have you heard?

Bumbling idiots for news correspondents see the desperate need to form a new foreign policy
Yet they give their credence to the pro-war pandering
As we all squabble over Saturn's rings

Regimented doubletalk undercuts the pertinence
Of our corporate heads trying to run away with tax cuts
In their vestables, the evangelicals are tent-poles
Begging the Head of State
"Deregulate the gross!"

Happy ever after
Benefactors all settle matters
The senate gathers to celebrate the fat fuck's
Inability to give a single solitary hoot
About the proletariat
Their merriment is gross

What does this mean for you though?

[VERSE 3]
You nigga's looking gee'd up
Rolling in a Prius
But I gotta give my money management a C+
With my foreclosed home
And pork bowl loans
I revisit the need to grind

I'm dating Russian fem-bots
Sipping on some hemlock
Cause I got overdue billing on my desktop
When I've been overthought and undercooked
That's when I need me time

[BREAK]
Me Time (repeat)

Well, I need some me time with the pulmonary palimpsest

Watch the banks merge, liberal thinker
Because now the middle finger is the California state bird
If you ain't heard[Intro]
I'm gone
After you said what you did
I don't when I'm coming back
Spill the wine
Return the gifts
I'm out of here

[Busdriver]
I don't want to ruin your ball-gown
Because I'm not feeling law-bound
You can probably coffee-grind by body-mind into a psychotropic compound
An ice age will thaw before I'm able to play ball
Your cryptic texts are state law
Yet read like an algebraic scroll
But I know you're gone
After that gut wrenching shout match
And my out of whack palm read, got me on leave
In the outback with some lounge act
Don't crossbreed with my ennui it's a mousetrap
For the besmirched and weakened
I'm like a jerk telling you to twerk for the church of England
My advice to you is Socratic: don't panic if I look like a dope addict
Because I'm depressed as shit
Knowing that my capricious lover is a migrant bird
Your absence caused quiet stirs
That progressed into a violent dirge
Of victim blaming and miscellaneous quips to prove that my discourse's boyish
I had the heart explained to me
I was drawn and quartered by harsh voices
But you forgot to listen to me when I said

[Bridge]
I'm impossible to love and cannot keep an open mind
So you left me where I was
Shredded in your motion lines
(x2)

[Hook]
We never touched on it, touched on it
What we left
To be in love and treated love like a brush with death
We never touched on it. (x2)

[Busdriver]
(This shit is depressing. Get over it.)
Slice at the knuckle where the mind bends
And I'll become a motherfucker fucker times ten
Crisis all look enormous when your body suffers a sugar shortage
I'll cook a swordfish or prep any gourmet platter to simulate your gray matter
Girl, this rap shit left me worse for wear
And I ain't got that perfect hair, my love feels like a cervix tear
But still kiss me by my desk light
Cause you look like my next wife
I'm here burning midnight oil
Soaking gravitas into cotton swabs
In return I get tight coils of human waste as toothpaste
Oh I get it, I'm old news, a motherfucking brontosaurus
And to think I invited you to my underwater forest
A thousand fuck-you's are spring-loaded in your balled up fist
I open my palms and my eyelids become two pussy lips
And I deserve it

[Bridge]

[Hook][Intro/ Interlude 1]
The chef used during the seven days in which perfect hair was recorded cost roughly
Everything

Oh shoot (yeah)
Driver!
Ohh

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Hi, I'm Regan
I don't rap for free
And yes I’ve got a bachelors degree but you knew that, come on
And still you never would admit how sick I've become

This year my pigment’s bluer
What am I, a crip from hoover?
Oh no, It’s a malignant tumour!
Oh, I knew it. Come on!
And still you never would admit how sick I’ve become

(Cuts to the Second Interlude)

[Interlude 2]
This is "Perfect Hair" by Busdriver
It costs .146 million US dollars to make
The musical accompaniment on tracks 5 through 12, cost 6000 euros each
The backup singers used on tracks 1 through 3, cost 3500 US dollars per take
The studio time at our home studios cost half a million Brazilian reals per lockout session

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
I'm a frequent flyer
And a decent liar
And that's a lie in itself but you knew that, come on
And still you never would admit how sick I've become

I eat my food raw
Grew up bourgeois
Never run game like a cue ball
But you knew that, come on
And so you'll never admit how sick I've become

I'm not a cool dad
Nor a new fad
I'm my daughter's own private enigma, come on
And still she never could admit how sick I've become

I'm dope as fuck
I know what's up
And I did not blow up but you knew that, come on
And so you never would admit how sick I always was

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
My clothes are dirty
And I'm over thirty
And you can't quit me cold turkey but you knew that, come on
It's about time we've admitted how sick this has become

I'm no one
And everywhere I only breathe heavy air
But you knew that, come on
Why can't we admit how sick this has become?

I used to wake up at noon
To punch the moon
And fuck my life in her puncture wound
Come on

[Outro]
Come onI decrease my ventricle
Eat the peach of my special ho
Bleaching sheets with an X and O
While we breathe deep while flexible
Your cheat-sheet's un-ethical
Homie, decrease your decibel

My team's deeper than dressing robes
Going "Hee Hee" at your present goals
You eat your crescent rolls
With cheese wiz in your flesh folds
Seek deep in your section codes
Because you didn't do well in your exit polls
Not me, nigga, boy's straight
I can land hoes like "Ahoy Mate!"

But I feel that after the noise game
Free Spink rethink Tolstoy's take
Hot topic at the water cooler
Richer niggas they're on to the movers
Like entrepreneurs
Store fronts gettin' foreclosed
And poured o's
In Morse code
During the whole Southland Art exhibit
Making murals from thousands of parking tickets

Through the 90's
I stepped in poo-poo
I think the Headsman stepped in Fubu
Girls wanna let me inspect their juice boobs
My niggas call me Desmond Tu-Tu

Reborn on an online forum
Born out of an egg yolk
I am a synthetic life form
So I'm gonna go rob a stage coach
Or the dude with the hip
With my stick
Go naked under a rain coat

Gold [???]
Social injustice
As my advocate scapegoat
I really wanna go hard in the paint
Better go disheartening
And the painting
[???]
Since I was eighteen
Eating peanut butter sandwiches
And the baked beans

On my lunch break
(???) speed
My fuck face
[???]
Gettin' cup-caked
Other mouths gettin' ducktaped
Oh


I praise the style
Like a gemstone
Cause it feels like
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones
Barbs over
Shit

That style you got
Is from a rest home
Large stuffed
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones
Y'all kiddin' me
[???]

No corporate endorsements
Just door splits
Wr're enabling lives
(???) Abelton Live
I can trickle the name on the skies
Then I'm able to wonderize
Minimize Bible covers
Like it was
Casual Friday on a nude beach

(???)
Like a school week
At the pitch meeting
I get artsyI threw my hands in the heavens, I own what I touch
This world's big enough for the both of us, but for me it's not enough
So I gotta colonize the moon
Colonize the moon (x9)

[Verse 1]

If you were here for the last song about world leaders and street fashion
We bent the truth quite a bit, and would like to announce the following redaction
First, my homie didn't die violently but he died of laughter
Binge drinking on diet Shasta
He slipped and fell down the fire ladder, but why does that matter
Second, I don't make money like an NFL runningback
If I could really turn a jack-o-lantern into a sports car
Why's my driveway look like a pumpkin patch
Third, I'm not that leftist
I ditched that ultraviolet lambast
With a code of silence that co-pilots militarized unmanned craft
And fourth, your hair fuels life
'Til the moral standards became puree paste
Could've stripped us open with ? to the cavalcade's birthday cakes
And fifth, I don't think the country's run by blackened hellions
My business practices are Machiavellian
And a room for my throne of jagged skeleton
And six, I do recruiter overreaching my locals on every Mars rover
With cure coats for cart-holders and product placement where your charted lobes were
And seventh, I can't agree with philanthropy of tycoons
Cause this money ain't made for saving children
It's to help me colonize the moon

[Hook]

Colonize the moon (x4)
So I gotta
Colonize the moon (x5)

[Verse 2]

If you were here for the last song about world leaders and street fashion
We bent the truth like so, and would like to announce the following redaction
First, I think all your primitive poises are a pantomime's slow wank
That's why I greet 'em all with "atta boy", just a data point in the phone bank
Second, I do want your idea of new success to be crude at best
So when you hit those pratfalls insured by past laws
It won't be something even you can detect
Third, I do admit that sexual appetites conflict with ambition
But it's important that my life resemble Pimp C fan fiction
And fourth, I can assume the standing of finger point at an unfaithful man
When I'm a dog who feeds on excess that needs to express his anal gland
And fifth, I had to withhold
I never sniffed or sold a spec of coca
I'd be quarantined like I broke a fever
Or like a bloated diva with a leather boa
And six, our social fabric's been woven into some crazy polymer
With men in blue flannels and red flannels cooing death prattles through a baby monitor
And seventh, I can't agree with philanthropy of tycoons
Cause this money ain't made for saving children
It's to help me colonize the moon

[Bridge - Pegasus Warning]

All have done and all I've seen

Who cares about you
What else could I be
After all I've done and all I've seen

Who cares about you
What else could I be

[Hook][Verse 1: Busdriver]

We’re not gonna quit, that’s the popular myth of our ancestors
Wallow in, drop to the pit with a sock on my prick
And my hands severed, I got one option to pick in an ominous grip
Of a planned centure , I take it cause I'm no apologist
For the chocolate chips that make a man's center, I’m where a hollow abyss
And an obelisk can stand together. While you’re out talkin' that shit
Those innocous crips they fan embers at the book burnings
When I jot down the script, my god is a bitch who’s transgendered
Up and dropped off a fifth on a modular synth, it’s a great gesture, nigga
(the opt of a gist when a cop is a fit for a clansmember)
It’s on the top of your list, a pop of the clip withstands pressure and squeeze
(Now shot to shift?) (my...) was a damn treasure, and you are lost to the mist
Cause you're not equipped to be man's successor
I'm the next step when the postular swiss leave tropical fish that swam together
(But you hate front me cause the bottle is thick) and my skin colour is a tan leather
But I can start you over, let me paint you, I can paint you ’cause I can never hate you

[Hook: Open Mike Eagle]
Let me paint you, I wrote a riddle in a dream
And it came true
Riding around town selling bottles of this oowee
From the moon like these other fools can’t do
Let me paint you, I wrote a riddle in a dream
And it came true
Riding around town selling bottles of this oowee
From the moon like these other fools can’t do

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]

They handed us the precious stones
To keep your flesh and bones dancing in infected zones
And that philosopher’s rock is just a stepping stone
The higher goal is putting stutters in your metronomes
And we can lock this whole vibe in a quarantine
My brothers hover in the sky like they war machine
The first moment's like a high dose of Thorazine
That when the chorus sings I swear to life I see an old forest Brontasaurus scene
And three enormous kings, the Eye of Horus, start recording while hornet stings
My vital organs vibrate like a super-string
Spin the black circle till it sprouts Mini Cooper wings
We got the doubts so had to slow it down to bulletspeed
And fast forward as back where it used to be before king Cooper introduces you to user-read
Keep a journal ’cause my future is confusing me, it’s looping beautifully

[Hook]

[Bridge: Busdriver]
Paint me a comet that I've never seen
One that can’t be mistaken for anything
Likethe center of the sun
Paint me a comet that I've never seen
One that can’t be mistaken for anything

(I was born a king
I was born a king)

[milo]
I sat by my secret window to draft a thesis
On stretch limos as they pertain to black Jesus
And nascent bimbos destined to consume crack pieces
And why come it’s never gringos who lack visas
To work food trucks and make tasty snack tazers
I felt its reverberations through my hipbone
And I spoke the truth through wide nigga lips syndrome
That’s why accidental racism was just a thorn to me
Mike Eagle keeps telling me that I was born a king
They could not possibly afford the thing that they came to seek
They try to tame the meak, they’d have to pain their feet
And speak daintily, they couldn’t pay off these plaintiffs with their plane receipts
And I have found purpose from the pain in me
The days will pass and my curls will begin to look more like a crown
And I hear Alex Haley's ghost speak in Morse code without a sound[Intro]
Everything is great up until you show up (x5)

[Verse I]
Force fit murders and corporate merger
Are so "New world"
Horseshit burgers keep force, and click cursors
Make you so "user friendly"
Compassionate conservatives who get maximum superlatives
Is so "Neo-Reaganomics"
(there are certain no-no)
Claiming ownership of this Pangaea puzzle piece
Is so "English settler"
Oh la di me on my out of body body builder's muscle beach
Is so " Out of character for you
Seeing you underestimate how government officials furor and decimate
Is so "up your alley"
And other world variety packs with apocalyptic anxiety tax
Is so "1999"
So typical (you are)
Now this for obscene language and loud music
Which are now news clips of social under rest
But it's a crowd-shooting mix
Cause i redden all the rubber flesh, I'm hunted by Boba Fett's
And these are the minimal of substance
I'm the political pundit, I'm cynical and unfit
For day to day life I've got a pitiful pun kick
But at least I'm not on that criminal thug shit
Then they hide the doors that rape states right

[Hook I]
And it was great and it was cool
But then along came this biter
And he was so out of touch
So completely self indulgent
Just so out to lunch
So when there's a writ [in desperate?] need of a style of consultant and some school enrollment
People need help...

[Godzilla sample scratching]
(Yea)

[Verse II]
Now those recorded on toaster ovens doing their over dubbing
Is so "20th century"
Giving sell buyers harsh pile drivers
Is so "me"
This machine kills fascists and other unwanted guests
Now when I improvise showers risk the skies from brain storm rain clouds
I'm Coltrane and Kurt Cobain's brain child
And you're soaking wet, wanting to use these rap sounds for your bath towels
My moods for a chin check, I'll give you this crank valve
So you can smoke it in a platinum album and feel at home
TV sprout seedlings that cheer bling bling (bling bling)
And also force feed
Footage of bombs over Baghdad
To distract from my palms over scratch pads

[Hook II]
And it was cool hunky dory
I wasn't hungry or horny
But then along came this biter
And he was so out of touch (so completely)
So completely self indulgent (totally)
Just so out to lunch (out there)
So when there's a writ [in desperate?] need of a style consultant and some school enrollment
Style consultant school enrollment

[Outro]
Yeah
Do-do
(turn this shit music, this goddamn hippie phase have fucked up the music... I'd like to get my hands on one those little bastards. Getting away with murder. Sex, drugs, pissing on America, fucking up the music.)

Biter[Verse 1: Milo]
Boredom is represented by the Sunday
One day I will redecorate my living space with Feng Shui
Re-calibrate my auras
Align my chakras with doorknockers from Pier 1 Imports
I have been a good sport, patiently waiting on my turn
While learned astronomers paint constellations upon urns
I grow where the red fern simply cannot
And Hellfyre Club exists to thicken the plot

[Hook: Busdriver]
Leak out the coiled kink
It's knighted at the roller rink
Ya'll know we overthink
And so we keep them argyle socks on
Argyle socks on
Argyle socks on

[Verse 2: Milo]
At the height of my despair
All I could think about was
Weebles wobble but do not fall down the stairs
They do not scream out their prayers
Why did the supreme deity permit BET to represent all our affairs
I think that was an error
But I am scared sir to raise my voice above a reasonable tenor
Now I pluck my suspenders, and contemplate the zen words
Like I am Alan Watts or a palindrome for Medabots

[Hook: Busdriver]
Leak out the coiled kink
It's knighted at the roller rink
Ya'll know we overthink
And so we keep them argyle socks on
Argyle socks on
Argyle socks on
Black math tutor known to keep the circuit wet
Go pop a percoset
Keep them argyle socks on
Argyle socks on
Argyle socks on

[Verse 3: Milo]
Keep a large stash of nice pens
Learn not to be rash with monthly stipends
Forget the names of every tight end on all the teams
Do not let yourself become addicted to Benzedrine
Tempered dreams with muffler steam among other things
Give your mother angel wings
Pluck piano strings but call it a harpsichord
Build a log cabin from particle boards
If you're not already bored

[Hook: Busdriver]
Ya'll know we overthink
Ya'll know we, ya'll know we
Ya'll know we overthink
Ya'll know we overthink
Ya'll know we, ya'll know we
Ya'll know we overthinkI know this group and they're so avantcore
I bought their shit at the mom and pop store
And I give all of their songs the top score
I'll see them play on their small hip-hop tour
They're treated like sex symbols, out the stretch-limos
Autographing breasts with lead pencils
Now everybody thinks that they're the best new group
As if they're a pop band test tube fluke
They bought a home that's the size of a ballpark
You can only cross the property with a golf cart
But they no longer can sell a billion records
Because when they first weren't trying was their last brilliant effort

Rappers say the darndest things that you'll ever hear
Like "I heard you sold this many units" and I say "wish me better luck next year"

There seems to be too much water pressure
Underneath your genre-mesh blur
And to be honest I never took interest
In the modern day Young Black Teenagers
I'd thought they'd gone away replacing
What's on gun racks with cheese graters
To use on the spongy mind
Of the LA rapper swinging from a monkey vine
Style biting used to result in a money fine, but now

Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like I'm edgy and I'm risque and I say better luck next year

I replied to the wuss with a yo mama's joke
When he said how much he pushed the envelope
A group of sexually ambivalent nihilists
Crying from an ovarian cyst
Picking at a vegetarian dish
Idolizing a German band that barely exists
But me, my name's never on the full-color flyer
I'm just the dull Busdriver
Thinking 'til my head is a bowl of dust fibers
To all the fools up under their trucker hats
Sagging until you can see their plumber's cracks
There is no metaphorical meaning
So don't bother sifting through the storyboard in one seating
It's just horribly demeaning
And you can't do burners
I want the colors back
Don't want to hear your dumb ideas
Just shut your trap
Jumping jacks thunder claps in your bubble gum raps

Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like "I did a song with so-and-so and I got signed" but the checks will never clearI decrease my ventricle
Eat the peach of my special ho
Bleaching sheets with an X and O
While we breathe deep while flexible
Your cheat-sheet's un-ethical
Homie, decrease your decibel

My team's deeper than dressing robes
Going "Hee Hee" at your present goals
You eat your crescent rolls
With cheese wiz in your flesh folds
Seek deep in your section codes
Because you didn't do well in your exit polls
Not me, nigga, boy's straight
I can land hoes like "Ahoy Mate!"

But I feel that after the noise game
Free Spink rethink Tolstoy's take
Hot topic at the water cooler
Richer niggas they're on to the movers
Like entrepreneurs
Store fronts gettin' foreclosed
And poured o's
In Morse code
During the whole Southland Art exhibit
Making murals from thousands of parking tickets

Through the 90's
I stepped in poo-poo
I think the Headsman stepped in Fubu
Girls wanna let me inspect their juice boobs
My niggas call me Desmond Tu-Tu

Reborn on an online forum
Born out of an egg yolk
I am a synthetic life form
So I'm gonna go rob a stage coach
Or the dude with the hip
With my stick
Go naked under a rain coat

Gold [???]
Social injustice
As my advocate scapegoat
I really wanna go hard in the paint
Better go disheartening
And the painting
[???]
Since I was eighteen
Eating peanut butter sandwiches
And the baked beans

On my lunch break
(???) speed
My fuck face
[???]
Gettin' cup-caked
Other mouths gettin' ducktaped
Oh


I praise the style
Like a gemstone
Cause it feels like
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones
Barbs over
Shit

That style you got
Is from a rest home
Large stuffed
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones
Y'all kiddin' me
[???]

No corporate endorsements
Just door splits
Wr're enabling lives
(???) Abelton Live
I can trickle the name on the skies
Then I'm able to wonderize
Minimize Bible covers
Like it was
Casual Friday on a nude beach

(???)
Like a school week
At the pitch meeting
I get artsy[Intro: Nocando]
Cha, cha, cha

Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's
Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's

Yeah, yeah

Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's
Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's
Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's

Ah, here we go

Cha, cha

[Verse 1: NoCanDo]
Tilt ya head back
Make ya shoulders shake
Let ya arms swang
Baby hold up weight
Bend ya back a little
Now a little mo'
Not that much
Alright, there ya go
I did the bernie
A bernie with a dirty birdy
She put the, she put the thang on the thang thang
She did the bernie with a flirty curtsy
And worked it like a slave on a chain gang
We cut a rug
And laid a layer of carpet
I showed Ragan, Ragan said "You retarded."
I'm expressin' myself
I'm a artist
Embody bernie, nig, nigga I'm a carcass
Nigga I'm the coolest
Nigga I'm the smartest
Turn the beat on I do my bernie regardless

[Hook]
Cool as a corpse
Cool, cool as a corpse
Cool as a corpse
Cool, cool as a corpse, corpse
Cool as a, cool, cool, cool as a corpse, corpse, corpse

Its kinda like Weekend at Bernie's

Cool as a corpse
Cool, cool as a corpse
Cool as a corpse
Cool, cool as a corpse, corpse
Cool as a, cool, cool, cool as a corpse, corpse, corpse
Its kinda like Weekend at Bernie's

Dance like a old dead white man
Dance like a old dead white man
Do the old dead white dance
Dance like a old dead white man
Hawaiian shirt, fishermen hat
Hawaiian shirt, fishermen hat
Hawaiian shirt, fishermen hat
...Khaki cargo pants

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
I used to think I was super cool
Dance until I smelled like a puma stool
Jazz hands with glitter gloves and jitterbug
Up with this rap band
Started dancing like they needed cat scans
He said shake your head and let your arms go numb
And make your body heavy like a cargo ship
Now I'm really cookin with the charcoal lit
I used to sweat 1993, and dress like Diamond D
But doin' the bernie cured my "hey-bruh"-titis B
Now everyday I do the bernie
And power lunch with Jewish attorneys
Bought a Coffee Bean, paired up to form a Ponzi scheme
Like I do the Bernie Madoff
For real, only eat pâté, and play golf

[Hook]

[Outro: Busdriver]
Flash bang grenada
Teachin' old people how to dance
Get em my nig[Hook: Aesop Rock]
You don't wanna be some old dude
Shaking a fist at the new bold youth
You were the new bold youth, now you some old dude
You don't wanna be some old dude
Wagging a finger at the new bold youth
You were the new bold youth, now you some old dude

[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
And I know you know I'm sucker proof
Mediate the over under, leaning over onion soup
And soda... Armchair's under ooze
Camera's on the entrances, TV's on The Bugaloos
Speaking of, what's up with you's? Y'all tried chilling?
No, whole time bow tie spinning, like "Hzzzzzz..."
Cough cough sputter, not to worry, there will always be another
I wanna say I nurtured all you little green settlings
But these lapses get the guillotine snapping, it's distracting
All-righty, play me what bumps
Yuck, I'm getting too old for this, shucks
Aes stay gold for this much
Gray and mostly tits up
Old man winter, eyes on the prize
Give the lowest of lives, the highest of fives
Cause..

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]
Wassup breezy, its the brush fire
Put Vicks on my chest like I'm Russ Meyer
I love Breyers
But I'm dumb tired
When they say "based"
I say "safe" like an umpire
They say waders are lame with the brush binder
Daryl Hall hair is bald as a bus tire
Janitorial and we're sore when his funk fibres
Start moving pip-squeaks like I'm Keith on a drum riser
Up in the club krumpin'
What up shorty?
"Yo, what are you, like 40?"
That's a whole other story with rips in the root page
And if age is just a number it's bugging it's room mates
Like dudes, keep it down you're driving me Bruce Wayne
And I'm three floors down and still hearing your 2chainz
Oh that's One Direction well regardless dude
It's not Nas getting live at the barbecue
So tomorrow dude just keep the drama calm
Because it's not funny when you call me Big Papa John

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
I am not here at the Raise A Roof or Parallax for feral cats
I'm in the same age group as Darryl Mac
Ask these slender teens if the denture cream is in stock
Engendered of remembered dreams in my inbox
Of [???] denim jeans or Gwendoline's like, "Pick rocks"
Now my bum knee and limbs pop like rimshots
And twenty-something's hard to compromise movie tropes
While my aftershave is some homogenized Uzi smoke
[???] optimize the booty stroke
While my sole possesion is a fossilized dookey rope
I mean I got etchings in my worry lines
But how the dream rings off the the precipice of thirty-nine
It's depressing, some pre-dating toe tags
Spell checking in a suicide note drafts
Y'all pull vintage tees out of them tote bags
I got a vintage me that is visibly cro-magYou could tell it's me

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
I'm dressed like a punk singer killing - with a humdinger
But to tell who I am you don't need no sketch artist
Cause I rep the hardest on a cassette cartridge
I am Driver, you know me? Act right and yell out to me
And yell out to me, and yell out to me
And yell out to me, and yell out to me
Cause I was the cutest kid who blew the wigs at music gigs
Yes I am the putrid -, you know how Driver does

[Hook]
Wake up, I know you see me when I'm blowing dope
In school zones, I'm too grown, can't you tell?
Wake up, I know you see me when I'm on the road
I'm en vogue turnt, can't you tell? Can't you tell? Can't you tell?
Is it cause of how we did this here way before we could earn a wage?
Is it cause of how I fit my hood in a turn of phrase?
Is it cause my niggas know this world's a perfect cage?
I don't know, do you get it? Can't you tell?

[Verse 2: VerBS]
See I'm fly, at least I try not to try dressing weird, DIY
DIT, BYO, A-B-C-D-fill in the blanks
Subculture anthro-poly-amour-indie glamour
Simply wholesome chicks want me to hold 'em, stroke 'em
Over here, I'm over hill, been slicing awesome, what can I say?
This shit that I'm involved in, I used to revolve around it often
Now we the small talk of the big town, that's small talk with tall box
When they sit down, do you get it now? Make it legit now

[Hook]

I mean I know I always say some dumb stuff like this
Only I would leave the house dressed like this man
You could tell it's me

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
I rep that L.A. nigga without the mineral peel
Hopping off those minstrel's heels, my dap hand stays upturned
I stuff urns with buzz terms cause I'm crazed
Cause I'm crazed, cause I'm crazed
I show off signs of dementia, just throw my mind in a blender
Me and my niggas was often used as target practice
Without no troop aid in spacesuit grade starter jackets
But we did our shit anyway, we did our - the way we wanted

I'm from Hellfyre Club my dude
I'm from Los Angeles homie
Can't you tell? I know you can
Perfect Hair, VerBS, Driver, Hellfyre ClubBusdriver & (Radioinactive)
Today’s weather is a glazed beverage with a grave emphasis on the strange letter bridge and the dames we assist when we exchange  leadership
Put the change in the meter bitch
Y’all can eat some zebra shit with a fork and knife and tartar sauce
It’s the corporate plight of Haagen-Dazs
To pour Coors Light on the cotton clothes

(Busdriver)
Of people who bring flat screens to book burnings
And put earnings in the soiled pampers of oil canvas painters

(Radioinactive)
Painting pictures of people with mixtures of evil watered down with a gospel crown
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore

(Busdriver)
I don’t think we’re in Timbuktu
Get a lip-tuck tit-reduction big-butt-lip-o-suction at the annual bible luncheon

(Radioinactive)
I pull stunts in
With an eyeball crunched grin
Why not wear a waterproof necktie to the function
Do what you gotta do
Go to Lake Havasu to cook some rabbit stew and have an old lady gab at you

Busdriver & (Radioinactive)
The Weather will talk your head off
The parking attendant will park your attention span against the demented plan of a white ninja in Japan with Red Cross medical coverage
Our legible smudges are well received like health-conscious women dressing their husbands
Drinking vegetable slushes
I disassemble my musket over an instrumental of Milli Vanilli
The caterpillars are willing to kill me
The castle builders are building a villa for women and children are living in limited numbers with primitive plumbers
An innocent mother is giving a pilgrim some supper

Busdriver & (Radioinactive)
Today’s forecast is that you’ll be suffering a pain in your lower back
You can not get on this plane without a boarding pass
You should drink a quart of gas
It’s interesting how nuclear warheads laugh
As Hercules’ forehead is smashed on a wall of weather
That’s why we wear these koala sweaters like they were tailored
Let’s save a whaler from major failure in a Vegas trailer
Page your dealer
Pay the waiter for a plate of tatters
Irritate your neighbors by real estating acres near a lake where ravers get earaches from lasers
Bearded naked bathers get near the sacred savior to hear the tape deck player cold front
We’re to old to smoke blunts
So we promote funk that make’s adults hump
We catapult jump[Intro]
Hey.... Hey.... Hey....

[Hook.1]
You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm a walking plane-crash to your moms and dads
Ostentatious and crass pulling the gauze
Off your scabs
Bitch, I negate the myth of the 'great black boyfriend'
In the Polaroid at the get-together
Wearing a corduroy vest-sweater
So don't get that engagement ring engraved
Cause before we met you thought
That hoodrats laid eggs
And that rappers were just sky-pirates with peg legs
But I kick it with you simply for the shits and giggles, playful innuendo’s
You thought
"He's just an uber-dred for the federal fiscal cap"
But after brunch, you'll need
2 Sudafed's and a disco nap
After I drain your insides with a crazy straw
You ain't my baby doll-
"Cuz Nigga you reek of coffee shop blend"
My body's a lollypop that caters to the
Miss polyglot’s whim
With addictive agents that outweigh oxycodones
And our phobias perfectly fit
It takes a quirky chick with curvy hips to petrify this working-stiff

[Hook.2]
You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself
While I'm still on the shelf
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags

[Verse 2]
I'll be today's avatar of the prefab
Then end up a child star in rehab
It's like a bed-and-breakfast
I'm sending a text message on my key pad
Saying, "I have no more to say
To me ex-manager(slash)sea hag divorcee
Except eat shit and die"
My daily commute ends with a fender-bender
Cause no one acknowledges my ten-year tenure
I've got the know-how the thrill your scene
But they want someone lowbrow, a philistine
With iron-on irony for Viacom's white honkies
They'll send you a girl wearing
Tight thongs under nylon gi's
"Let's all hit!"
But I'm not for the gaudy gangbang
The thought of it turns my member to a soggy plantain
And shit, I get off on news leads
And you pet mouse meat
Set and poised with sex toys
In your penthouse suite believing you're Lou Reed
I spit used reeds out the wet mouthpiece
Even when sex appeal is taboo
Electric bills are past due
My head is clear of engineered, election year snafu

[Hook.2]
You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself
While I'm still on the shelf
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags

[Bridge]
I used to say, fuck it
Wouldn't placate the functionaries
Too busy making playdates with buxom secretaries
But I hope that my homies don't laugh
My choreographed dance steps
Are a little effeminate for a sociopath
We've been airbrushed so much we look like a claymation zoo
I'm a voice-over on your Playstation 2
But in my hey-day my ethical fiber
Would turn stages into firewood

[Hook]
You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself
While I'm still on the shelf
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flagsI threw my hands in the heavens, I own what I touch
This world's big enough for the both of us, but for me it's not enough
So I gotta colonize the moon
Colonize the moon (x9)

[Verse 1]

If you were here for the last song about world leaders and street fashion
We bent the truth quite a bit, and would like to announce the following redaction
First, my homie didn't die violently but he died of laughter
Binge drinking on diet Shasta
He slipped and fell down the fire ladder, but why does that matter
Second, I don't make money like an NFL runningback
If I could really turn a jack-o-lantern into a sports car
Why's my driveway look like a pumpkin patch
Third, I'm not that leftist
I ditched that ultraviolet lambast
With a code of silence that co-pilots militarized unmanned craft
And fourth, your hair fuels life
'Til the moral standards became puree paste
Could've stripped us open with ? to the cavalcade's birthday cakes
And fifth, I don't think the country's run by blackened hellions
My business practices are Machiavellian
And a room for my throne of jagged skeleton
And six, I do recruiter overreaching my locals on every Mars rover
With cure coats for cart-holders and product placement where your charted lobes were
And seventh, I can't agree with philanthropy of tycoons
Cause this money ain't made for saving children
It's to help me colonize the moon

[Hook]

Colonize the moon (x4)
So I gotta
Colonize the moon (x5)

[Verse 2]

If you were here for the last song about world leaders and street fashion
We bent the truth like so, and would like to announce the following redaction
First, I think all your primitive poises are a pantomime's slow wank
That's why I greet 'em all with "atta boy", just a data point in the phone bank
Second, I do want your idea of new success to be crude at best
So when you hit those pratfalls insured by past laws
It won't be something even you can detect
Third, I do admit that sexual appetites conflict with ambition
But it's important that my life resemble Pimp C fan fiction
And fourth, I can assume the standing of finger point at an unfaithful man
When I'm a dog who feeds on excess that needs to express his anal gland
And fifth, I had to withhold
I never sniffed or sold a spec of coca
I'd be quarantined like I broke a fever
Or like a bloated diva with a leather boa
And six, our social fabric's been woven into some crazy polymer
With men in blue flannels and red flannels cooing death prattles through a baby monitor
And seventh, I can't agree with philanthropy of tycoons
Cause this money ain't made for saving children
It's to help me colonize the moon

[Bridge - Pegasus Warning]

All have done and all I've seen

Who cares about you
What else could I be
After all I've done and all I've seen

Who cares about you
What else could I be

[Hook][Intro]

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
My eyes may wander towards your cosmic cleavage
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
It just means that I can't subdue my fudgehue's split second response time
When the underworld summons me and I become, what to do?
I told her I love her and she can put my heart in a box
But our quality time can overlap my selling CD's in a parking lot
My life's a gigantic nothing
Underneath the panic button
But you shouldn't feel that I never try to turn my doodlings into a house with a poodle swings
When I'm sick you're allowed to visit patients
So over my head you form a cloud of mal-precipitation
And my night depends on how loud the crowd participation is
So what if I want to rap forever
I can as well kiss goodbye this jacket-sweater
I think I should get a feverish band tattooed on my right wrist
I found out that love in L.A. is like being pricked with a manicured thorn
Innocent girls who looked like they used to star in amateur porn
One finical disaster
An exotic dancer is born
I really thought you're gonna fill out those UCS school transfer forms

[Outro]
Wowee look at that
The suicide princess enters the sky
Aw funny, funny how the cosmic robot baby
She's a beautiful clone she is

My eyes may wander towards your cosmic cleavage
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you (cause I love you)
It just means that I can't subdue my fudgehue's split second response time
When the underworld summons me and I become, what to do?[Verse 1]
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
It’s in the sky in chemtrails from a Dorner drone
There’s a war between feds and some Jesus
The winner ghost-wrote the pledge of allegiance
Niggas afraid to touch mason jars
There’s worse shit on your identification card
For any man to ever say another man is irrelevant
Is an ant trying to grow a trunk and dance like an elephant
So Mister Frankenstein, dead your experiment
Body so African and head so American
And here’s the deed to the motherfuckin’ promise land
A pound of weed and the pretty lyrics to rock ‘em in

[Pre-Hook]
One whole shattered into dividends
They’re connected by the rhythm and blood
Two extremes of faithful and paranoid
But neither ever really saw what it was
Every step a man is ever making
Was only past playing in another man’s original dream
And you keep seeing yesterday ‘cause its all gonna happen again

[Verse 2]
Brand new once again, one year later (its all gonna happen again)
Like never before, all over again, one year after (it’s all gonna happen again)
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
It’s in the sky in chemtrails from a Dorner drone
Niggas afraid to touch mason jars
But there’s worse shit on your identification card

[Hook]
I couldn't change your life but I wanted to
I wanted you to hear nothing else after this
The ego is the dirtiest of private parts
A spirit boner never sit unless its six feet high
I want this shit to do what it doesn’t do
Disregard other people’s choices as if they ain’t cool
When don’t nobody seem to know what to do
Except write these words
And record these words
Memorize these words
‘Til they get on our nerves
And we learn to never wait for what we think we deserve
Cause the money and the karma is imaginary
You don’t believe in your arteries and capillaries
But they still work
Nobody asked you to
Nobody not once ever asked you to
And they wouldn't till they found a way to benefit

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
It’s all gonna happen again
It’s all gonna happen again
It’s all gonna happen again
Everyone's still under arrest
Even the cops, army, and kids

[Hook][Verse 1 - Open Mike Eagle]

I need it sunny, pull the shades away
Lookin' at the sky like today's the day
I ate my breakfast like a king
My homies gon' be hungry, I won't feel a thing
Clothes ironed but it's weird
My family know I only iron once a year, yeah
I got a special treat, nestle crunch probably
Jacket members only, like my lunch posse
My wallet bulge on twenty five bucks
I coming home with that envelope from Lifetouch, yeah
Daaaaaaaaang

[Hook]

And I know they better not misspell my name homie
My momma probably thinkin' what the frame gon' be
My daddy better put me on his wall

[Bridge]

Natasha, it's picture day
Antonio, it's picture day
Eugene, it's picture day
Hey Brian, it's picture day

[Verse 2]

Yeah, a couple homegirls cheesed they little faces off
They happy cause they finally got they braces off
Gotta get a fresh fade, cut the beady beads
I heard they put your whole face on a DVD
My teacher, she a old freak wearing leopard print
Keepin' everybody breath right slangin' peppermints

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

It's my classes turn, we walkin' single file
Photo lady flirtin' with me cause she need a smile
Yeah, she thinks she's a pal of mine
What she don't know is that she gon' be my valentine
Yeah, stop in the hall, check my corduroys
They playin' Whitney Houston for the boys
My crew got them tough jackets
We 'bout to ante up, get that deluxe package
Look what I did with all my Christmas cash
Tryna pull a shorty from my older sister's class
Daaaaaaaaang

[Hook]

[Busdriver]

I'm in the corner where the dorks mope
Shouting answers gimme sore throats, pocket protecters and my sports coat
But it's picture day, so we tuck inhalers
Alphabetical order with gang bangers and chuck taylors
Yeah, but they don't know that we some surly tykes
Plotting all the worldly plights
Peep the hint of mischief as we grint all of our pearly whites
You won't roll the furry dice
But I bet your girly might
Oh, she's so sprung
And ya'll look so dumb and ho hum like ya'll some playful pheasants
I'm wavy in yearbooks like I need naval presence
Dressing like we play periodic table tennis
Handing you wallet sized pics, girl
They so precious

[Hook]

Hey Reagan, it's picture day
Hey James, it's picture day
Hey Rory, it's picture day
Hey Eric, it's picture day
YeahWhen I fall from the dream-catcher's mitt
I'm all thumbs
And not what she's after

My smoldering remains burn over glowing embers
As you ready and position short-term goal tenders
I lay un-kissed at the summer jams
A bag of ruptured glands
Who lacks reasoning to understand
My self-directed hate fits

We mouth the vilest sacrament
And adhere to these tacit skirmishes
All for one day ideal and saffron-drenched
We ate each other's hearts out of serving dishes

This soft science leaves my body underwhelmed
Our ambitious union dissolves out of the color film
And I am just a crude outline
Obscured and pegged and numbered
Dangling off power lines
One of many discarded ex-lovers
Throwing pet food from the red carpet
At de-colorized coupling of heart-shapes
And all the panic-stricken flower maidens
Update their 'who to hate' list
My journal entries are irony-laden
And tirelessly self-loathing

We mouth the vilest sacrament
And adhere to these tacit skirmishes
All for one day ideal and saffron-drenched
We ate each other's hearts out of serving dishes

(Falling from the dream-catcher's mitt
Falling from the dream-catcher's mitt,...)

We've mouthed the vilest sacrament

I fell from the dream-catchers mitt

With smoking incantations and dead language motifs

Their defected army becomes my rogue fleet

Sequestering yahoo, superimposes his frail personHaaaaaave you read the drivers manual?
What do you think of it?
Do you find it useful in piloting your hyperactive particle accelerating hovercraft
Made for the elitist gentry and upper class- wait a minute…
This is the wrong booklet

Oh here it is. have you read this drivers manual?
Oh you have
But youd like to exchange yours for another because yours seems to bear the teeth marks of a biters mandibles-
Uh oh wait a minute... somebody beat you to it
Somebody got a head start

??? has stretch marks and when I hear a wack tape I tend to lactate a milk thats lukewarm
While im resentful of feeling the guilt of tooting my own horn i think ive killed my newborn
But i didn't mean to; it ran away from home and was starring in nude porn
And i.. and i was so pissed off i stabbed it with my shoehorn
Burnt it using the ashes of my fertilized growing blue corn
Which is used to feed my unicorn
Which is ??? the ideologies of viewers in tv land in its true form

What have i done? what have i done?[Intro: Busdriver]
We leap through your T.V., bruh
My dudes sick like we looped leukemia
The beat sick like we looped leukemia
My scene sick like we looped leukemia
Alert the news media x2

[Hook: Nocando]
This that dorner (too soon)
That new town (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock, that god damn it that's (too soon) x2

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Mike Eagle will not fail, Mike Eagle will not fail
I repeat shit to myself more than these white people in Scottsdale
I'm a indie hustler first team
Fuck music, sell shirt screens
And I pull up to my rap show in a Ford Focus, on 13s
And my nephews in the eighth grade
He only talks about bayblade
And my supermarket is ralphs
On tour I'm looking for Safeway
I'm a cantankerous old coot
A man, a blanket no phone booth
And this never bitten [?] all or nothing
This ass naked as snow suit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: VerBS]
Squad is always full of haters
Me and flocka puff trees like Bob Marley and the whalers
Thick white girls, they must of came from the cater
I got the ill vibe I got the bay area flavor
That's how I open up all these hot bars
I'm out of this world nigga
Yeah I'm something like I'm a Mark Clark, ooh
I started rapping off the walls of Crenshaw
Back in the day I call that, yo
The burn parkour
Picked up the times, I blow niggas ran mouths
Any darlin' pardon my grand smile
On this marathon jog, I'm going to stand out
Opportunities open up, it's a plus if you dope as fuck and you rhyme like...

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Too soon...  too soon...

[Verse 3: Nocando]
Yuh
Icarus, niggerish
Genesis, Leviticus
Candy flipin' the Lawrence Fishburne crimson with that clear pill Limitless
In Bristol sipping Gunisses
Hard to handle like life with a wife and ten kids and six different mistresses (Woo!)
This shit is getting ridiculous
Niggas are getting so sensitive
Forgive me for my insolence
I ain't really into this
I got a new view through a new scope
I'ma be frank like the new pope
I don't give a fuck if them dudes dope
It's Hellfyre, eat a dick eat a dick till you dudes choke

[Verse 4: KAIL]
My neighbors are pigs, so we don't speak when we I grab the mail
My neighbors are pigs, so if my crowbar snaps a tail
I'm fast as hell, there ain't no catching KAIL
But, catch me if you can Frank Abagnale, pass the snail
But, we just gon' discount that as rails
Until they're on my traffic trail and know how this package smell
Long as you packin' cells, I pack the nail from the coffin that sends your rat ass back to hell
Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Busdriver]
Yeah
Niggas say my catalogue's to YMCA
Not enough YMCMB, and life plant reek of fresh brie
Yuh (Oh shoot!)
Like I'm a white man on a ten speed
Like I'm in Thailand, never rent free
All I ever need the mic stand, that's what the rats see
My socio never overshare
Look the hood calling me weird cuz my shit could weaponize the open air
Yelp alerts could be heard in ear buds
Believe in this [?] road flares
This shit is barely a beer buzz
You could never stand with us, like a leery jugs
Or apply there and buy share
I'm like hi there and I'ma buy this Paris
On the pulmonary palimpsest
Feedin' niggas in high chairs with an Allen wrench
No fashion sense from a [?] DuPont, big dog man call me Marmaduke
Might think tanks more than the [?] crew
Make the uninitiated barf and puke
We beside the finest from some smashed atoms
While ratchet hoes do tableaus till they suffer from back spasms
We climb backstage like Patch Adams
Took the game with us like backgammon
Press pass and test labs as my best gags it sounds like crash landings

[Verse 6: Rheteric Ramirez]
And they knew I was crazy without getting drunk and you thinking I'm tipsy
I kept it one hundred, I've never been fifty percent or fifty one fifty
The shit I see on the new Do' got me feeling chaotic neutral
Put yourself in my shoes though
What you think Tookie and Dorner would do bro?
Better check that [?]
I got some gangster shit that'll make you grey matter into a fuckin' hankerchief
Cause this is operation Repo
To take L.A. back from people
That wanna make dark skin friends without crossing Pico
If I force you to take the bus to places you're scared to drive to
Would reality coincide with what you buy on iTunes?
They say we rose from the ashes after riots, but I wouldn't believe it
Shaking that is like burning the wing of a dove, and calling that shit a phoenix
The cost of living that empty coffin, cause death is an empty wallet
This isn't the petty problems, of bitches and Mary Poppins
Whenever the [?] calls it
Give a fuck if my enemies talkin'
Destiny though will never be broke fasho that's been My War like Henry Rollins

[Outro: Busdriver]
Too soon... Too soon... [Repeated][Intro]
Driver!
(Look Out!)
Yeah
Oh Shoot!

[Hook]
I'm so hungry, man, I could the rich
Eat, eat, eat the rich

Check me out

[Verse 1]
Things are looking good, but I can't mess with your hair though
Ergo, the ladder climb is an air show
But thank God you like I'm fucking with that hood shit
And treat me like you think I wrote up the instruction booklets
The instruction booklets, the instruction booklets
Cause of my home, the hammers pop
But your selfies look like glamour shots
Before that endorphin high, I take orders like George Takei
And scorch the sky, poor guy, I'm a horse fly and that's because

[Hook]

Let's eat, Kenny
Celebrate a little bit
Let us not eat them
Celebrate if you eat, nigga

[Verse 2]
On high booty cheeks, y'all are thieves
Swallow new acts, how to rap
Don't let them style with child proof caps
You there? I'm a rough approximation of Type A
And Type B at a dice game in a white tee with a nice chain
And snarky web presence you can't turn up in a text message
Without at least a million video views
Watch the millennials brood
Make sense of it all, there's diamonds in the loaves of bread
I'm looking for 'em in the hood like a floating head
Like a floating head, like a-- like a floating head
My dinner prayers meant for an asteroid wake
I'm reading that shit from a fat boy's tape
I'm still eating, nigga, but it's all soy-based

[Hook]

Let's eat, Kenny
That's right
Perfect Hair

[Outro] x3
Kenny Segal's drums are like he's dropping desks
Your whole life's a hot mess, I confess, we got that Aquafresh

That's tight[Intro: Aesop Rock (Busdriver)]
Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying, but... is it sexier than torture?
(shah, yeah, Los Angles)
(Under the cellulite laden thigh of the night)
(Yeah, oh shoot, lemme see if I can finish this)
(Okay, lets go, yeah)
(We can make this better (x3))

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Under the cellulite laden thigh of the night
I slip miniature mantras between my cries and gripes
Jewel-flavored crystals in the red, blue, and white stripes
While crowds wanna resent me like The Price is Right
And downtime is never met with an overjoyed grin
Cause sleep and death have always been conjoined twins
You'd rather lick the red gills of pop art
And then your cement-filled epoch marks
The withering tendrils from my wrought heart
Reach for a Benadryl like it was a lost ark
Cause my average day is for the body of aegis, they're prompting these sieges
We cry to these seniors, living a side of splotchy Adidas
Serving consecutive sentences
My corrective lenses is ruby quartz
You're my bitch and ain't worth a jiggling of booty warts
Circumstances trap writers Kathy Bates
Under a neat colorized happy face
So my carbon covered in candy paint
There's still a namesake if it's a diaper rash
I'm pinging this on a cyber cast
Questioning news items playing pattycake with Ira Glass
The fact that this pony show's racist
Stirs the colloquial cake mix and charges the homeostasis
Of all the homies who await us like we some Smokin' Joe Fraziers
But my unchecked whining's like some ceremonial plate shift

[Hook: Busdriver]
We can make this better, or not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, or not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, or not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Before long, boil the bones
A little celery chop
A little pepper, a little milk of the poppy
Little posse in effect
Analog mono-poly Man'o'War
Walloping the auto-poly avatar
Mind on his Mallomars
Money on the iron lung
Clumsy with the can of worms
Usher you behind the sun
He shoots he whores, truly stupid troubadours and elders
Stock the shelter with frijoles and blueberry New York Seltzers
Roll up in a pa-diddle like a doofus
Hit the corner like the devil is a cubist
I'm ruthless, the sigil is dog with a cone, feeling foolish
Seven hells calling all foreseeable futures
Be an obtained culprit
Crippling migraine and strange stomach
Or a stray bullet through his gray mullet
I am ivy up the god damn lattice
March to the math rock
Raw, no cartoon mascot
The Mario pajama bottoms clumsily rappelling
Under a gibbous moon
Hunting for shitty food
Gunning, too tough, embedded in bad magic
Duckboy, shit is quacktastic

[Bridge: Busdriver]
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet

[Hook:]
We can make this better, or not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Rap Marilyn Manson, about as hot as a Vanson
With two hoodies on the beach with two bitches crump dancin'
Rappers put your bets in, last man standin'
Bars hit so hard you ricochet off the planet
The motherfucking hybrid, tell Miley Cyrus text me
When I holler to her private I'm tryna get them privates
Parts, don't start, take heart like Kano
Remember when I told to you niggas drink all the Dran-o
Pop all the pills, take all the lines
Chop through a window with some sawblade blinds
Back on that shit, guess what this time?
Half a stick of dynamite where the sun don't shine
Any nigga disrespecting, chin check 'em 'til he's slinky-neck
Blowing dope, eyes low and chinky like I'm Mannie Fresh
Countdown to extinction, no nigga not Megadeath
So many dead rappers, can't even take baby steps
Walking over carcasses of artists in my garden
Been nice with this shit since Nas was writin' past the margin
Any nigga wanna start it, I fuckin' beg your pardon
I'm with arson, I'm the firestarter; Prodigy invent the art
Smack my bitch up in the mouth with my dick
And it's not domestic violence cause she likes that shit
There's no sentence to describe it, homie
Except she sucked it like her fucking life depended on it

[Hook: Busdriver]Yo, rap a little, Driver, go for it!
Busdriver:
Make a hole and behold my whole mind
For the black holes, holy wars to hole nine
A whole body who goes stale with all the old biscuits
For growth sales hold the mail cause I'm holistic
My smalltalk is a folktale of old mystics
Its dollar value is a smoke trail of old Plymouths
I found footing on the coattails of show business
For this airy hole's a hotel with ghosts in it
I ensured the expulsion of astral goo
And caused convulsions as addictive as tobacco chew
My lips are the volcano's rare mica
Blink at the sky and have a rainbow dimmed by
Sharing the notion I pinch a shaft of light
From every hole I'm a messy troll who spat on tykes
Your every hole is lined with the gold bands
And you must be a coke can and I must be a whole man
The b-burial plot is where you all grow corn
I'm a dust mite whose blood type is lowborn
But now my lips from which sherry o sworn(?)
And my personal warmth is set to snowstorm!
But now my lips from which sherry o sworn(?)
And my personal warmth is set to snowstorm!

Open Mike Eagle:
I heard Kendrick Lamar's batman and Miley Cyrus
Likes to treat her microphone stand as if it's a large black man
They feed Tyson chickens liquid Viagara
Unemployed college grads would gentrify Africa
Hold up, there's breaking news about Lamar Odom
Coming through my 24 hundred barred modem
Thank you for letting me be myself again
Not European; I don't dig shows about elfin men
Revenge of the nerd rap tournaments; join us
As we drink on cheap beer and have to belch to win
Icecaps will melt your friends and my friends
Even the ones that eat raw food and do thigh bends
Might as well sucker punch Mike Tyson
Be a hood Heisenberg rollin' blunts full of Ricin
In Islamabad humming Hava Nagila
On a loudspeaker, quoting from Bhagavad Gitas
Rappers calling out names for other rappers to focus on
It's like an episode of Pokemon; Big Sean, I choose you!
I got a message for a lot of folks
You got two twitter accounts? Nigga I won't follow both
Nigga I won't follow both

Jeremiah Jae:
Set fire to the bandstand with propane
Let my spirit rise come and ride on the soul train
This is so flame, wash it with a cold drink
In a fishbowl find remnants of your whole team
Yeah, stimulated by the cold dreams
Black streets where they pack heat and hold beef
Throw c's off the boat, make these hoes scream
Always knew I could be a product of the dope G
If I didn't know the history I wouldn't repeat it
Like the Jam of the Week rap about big tires
On my nose G, you rap like a minor
Chilling by your 'rents bed with the night light on
Terrified by the dark, I'm a black hole
And a lightbulb and an elephant in the pressroom
You a yang, no yin in the cesspool
Etched in the memory of teenage girls who
Act tribal, monkey see, monkey do
Off that white dust on that white bus to the zoo
No visitor, more like a resident
Welcome to the show, you have been selected
To fill that Hellfyre, Hellfyre black jungle all you rappers just plummet
