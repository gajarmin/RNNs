Which side are you on? [repeat]

[Verse 1: G1]
See I gotta draw the line, I can't take it no more
If you ain't down with revolution, what you waiting for?
Making money for suckers and our communities poor
Ripping flags off of coffins, man, this ain't our war
Colonized and terrorized by the world's biggest killers
The US government, the biggest weapon and drug dealers
Filling prisons with children, incarcerating the future
Myspace and Facebook got us stuck on computers
Stuck on stupid bumping music that's abusive to the shorties
And the nonsense that you spitting, they just listen and absorb it
I've been dormant, I've awoken, I'm a giant, I'm ready
I'm with the APPO in Oaxaca and we holding machetes

[Verse 2: RodStarz]
I rock hard like Palestinian children holding slingshots!
I'm with every single kid that's down for hip hop
For the culture, the life, what it really stands for
This music is resistance, it's the voice of the poor
I'm on the side of the workers, the teachers, and lunch ladies
On the streets with brown mommies raising our brown babies
I'm with youth organizers cleaning up the Bronx river
I'm like Jaime Escalante when I stand and deliver
I'm with Evo Morales, man, he running Bolivia
Distribution of the land so we could all live bigger
I'm with Hugo and Fidel, Grandmaster and Melle Mel
I'm with the Panthers up in Queens, justice for Sean Bell
I'm with Camacho Negrón, I'm with Ojeda Ríos
Freedom for Oscar Lopez, time to get an appeal
I'm with Abu-Jamal, I'm with Assata Shakur
I'm with the compas in Immokalee getting a penny more!

[Hook]
Which side are you on?
Chi city!
Which side are you on?
South Bronx!
Which side are you on?
Oaxaca!
Which side are you on?
Palestina!

[Verse 3: Lah Tere]
I'm with Elvira Arellano, I'm with Rudy Lozano
I'm for a world without borders and a better tomorrow
I'm with Mothers on the Move, I'm with sistas on the rise
I'm with La Peña del Bronx, keeping culture alive
I'm with the kids at the Batey, watching a beat battle
Mean mugging all these yuppies in shorts and brown sandals
I'm with parents everywhere fighting for good schools
And for all these good women to find some good dudes
I'm with Salvador Allende, I'm Super Anti Momio!
Con el pueblo en la Havana grito Viva Cuba Cono!
For immigrants, activists, unions, and freelancers
For DJs, MCs, bombers, and breakdancers
I'm with editors, engineers, Indymedia
I'm with my family and my crew, Rebel Diaz
I'm with DJ Disco Wiz, a Latino pioneer
Cause it's dope when the elders break bread with the kids

[Verse 4: G1]
I'm for telling the truth, exposing the lies
Think about the dead soldiers when you're driving your ride
Them people died for the oil and Daddy Bush's revenge
I'm with the widows, the children, and the lonely best friends
I'm with Families Stayin' Together as ONE
I'm not for the raids and the deportations!
I'm with Victor Toro and the M.I.R
So watch out for those snitches in that unmarked car!
And for Lil Saulito, we gonna fight for your moms
So we gonna shout her out, twice in one song
I'm for twelve million workers and Elvira Arellano
I'm for a world without borders and a better tomorrow

[Hook]A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?
A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?

[Verse 1]
How can a government say they support human rights
When we know they only fight with dollar signs in their eyes
So it’s relief for the tsunami, money for the tidal wave
They’ve lost just as many lives in Africa from AIDS
In my country tis of thee, how come there’s poverty
If it’s Homeland Security, why the hell you watching me
And how come I go to college all the professors is white
All the students look alike like they related to the dean
Education ain’t a right, man education is a dream
A diploma is equivalent to getting a receipt
How do all the founding fathers look like officer friendly
How does Jesus look related to the cops that apprehend me
How you make your commericals, say it does a body good
Then take extacy and steroids so you can look and feel good
How many judges and lawyers still use cocaine
Then their Rockefeller laws keep my people enslaved

A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?
A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?

[Verse 2]
How can the richest country have so many homeless
Cause ten percent of the evil people got the money, you should know this
What’s a black republican, what’s a Latin bush supporter
And if Bush loves the war, he should send his own daughters
What’s a liberal guy that supports women’s rights
And on that very same day watches porn all night
If there’s freedom of speech, then what’s censorship
And how the hell you wearing Jordans and you root for the Knicks
How come hip-hop got political around election day
Yet any other time ain’t got shit to say
How many communists drive home in nice ass cars
To the comfort of a home with a stocked up bar
How Chicago the second city when we always in first
And if you don’t support Cuba, take off the Che shirt
A contradiction, yo it’s the root of our system
And if there’s really justice
Why it’s just us in the prisons

A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?

[Verse 3]
Why does the Christian right support a war that’s taking people’s lives
How many revolutionaries done beat up their wives
How many married men still take part in the chase
How come so many doctors do drugs to stay awake
And what about them priests that are secretly gay
Yet they still preach the word every single Sunday
And how many politicians have no social skills
Why so many millionaires don’t pay child support bills
And if a woman sleeps around then for sure she’s a ho
Yet when a man does his thing he must be full of mojo
Why do jocks take drugs just to hit home runs
Why you shopping for clothes with insufficient funds
Why you driving a Mercedes with no milk for the baby
Rolling on twenty-twos when your rent is past due
A contradiction, yeah that’s what it’s about
I just gave a few examples for you to think about(RODSTARZ VERSE)
I can't front im upset that they took our buildin
Next Thing the Comandante man I know they killed him
Something goin on I gotta read the signs
Somethin telling me that its about that time
Time to step it up cuz I still smell sulfur
Still smell the money in this capitalist culture
So im dedicatin verses to my boy jamil
He out there in Venezuela.. Frontline its real!
Hunts Point New York 2005
That's when I realized the revolution soo alive
We ain't never had a president come around mine
He brought OIL for the poor in the wintertime
He showed Love to the Bronx that's called Solidarity
We show love back ain't no politician scarin me
Anti imperialist til I we go delirious
The work is getting serious....that's why they keep fearin us!!

(CHORUS)
Do the mathematics Hugo Chavez was the baddest
I gotta work Chavez... (2X)
In Caracas
El proceso va palante
In Chicago
El proceso va palante
In the South Bronx
El proceso va palante
It goes worldwide
El proceso va palante

(G1 VERSE)
Forward
This movement ain't defeated
La lucha sigue
Dentro de todos esa rebeldia existe
La CIA comete crimen
Igual las ideas viven
Aqui el pueblo decide
No lo que los medios dicen
Queren parar una cultura alternativa
Fijate desde el bronx hasta america latina
Capitalista van
Capitalista vienen
Buscan tus bienes
Queren hacer lo que queren
Ahora decimos NO!
No al imperialismo
Al neoliberlismo
Los bancos
Los ricos
Ni un millonario
Chavez fue solidaario
Ni Bush ni Obama llegaron a ayudarnos
No lo olvidamos
Mas que Venezolano
Esto cruza frontera
Hip hop bolivariano
America unida
Como creamos ese frente?
Solidaridad por todo el continente!

(CHORUS)[Intro: Fred Hampton]
So we say, we always say in the Black Panther Party
That they can do anything they want to to us
We might not be back, I might be in jail
I might be anywhere
But when I leave, you can remember I said
That the last words on my lips were that
I am a revolutionary!

[Hook]
For the love of revolution
For the life that I lead
Y es por eso que yo canto
Con la familia que yo quiero
For my beautiful niece
Y es por eso que yo canto
For the future of the youth
That remind me of me
Y es por eso que yo canto
Para Chile, for Chicago
For the kids in hallseez (?)
Y es por eso que yo canto

[Verse 1]
I dedicate this to them kids
That remind me of me
Those rebellious motherfuckers
That I call MCs
It's them kids on the corners, in them circles
Spitting rhythms, ripping cyphers
Smoking purples and state(??), they still children
Buying 40s, giving money to the kid with ID
Six heads on one blunt
But they sharing the weed
Fuck school, they told jokes
And they never took notes
All they did was fill their notebooks
With some marvelous flows
Staring out the window
Daydreaming of shows
The limelight
The right life
How they bound to blow
And it's a dream that they all share
Who gonna get there?
I found a reason for my rapping
I ain't gonna fake it
I want a crib for my moms
On the beach in (??)
Y es por eso que yo canto
I want to open up a school
In the Bronx by the river
Y es por eso que yo canto
I'll be happy with a crib
And some land in the back
Y es por eso que yo canto
Sit back, smoke in the air
Dip and cognac
Y es por eso que yo canto

[Verse 2]
Sipping water out the wine glass
Smile on my face
Funny farmers hat on
To keep the sun out my face
I'll be content with teaching children
And building the young struggle
If hip hop organized
The whole world would be in trouble
Bush, run for cover
You be getting bum rushed
We'll get Bambaataa as the President
We all gon' crush
It's graffiti on the wall
But it's not advertising
Just a warning from the youth
About the future uprising
It's not surprising
That we seeking freedom
I don't believe 'em
I'll be happy with a Cavalier
Like my dad drove
A living room with chandeliers
And a matching carpet
I choose to rap cause sometimes
It's my only option
It's my freedom of expression
It's the voice of the oppressed
Y es por eso que yo canto
It's the power of the word
Man, you gotta use it
Y es por eso que yo canto

[Verse 3]
Cause I truly do believe
That I'm the seed of revolution
I rap, therefore I am
Part of the vocal contribution
To the call that's worldwide
Fight the struggle within
Organize, read books
Practice discipline
Use the culture as a weapon
That's unknown to them
Speak slang in a language
That's code to them
Make music, breakdance
Write your name on the wall
Write a paper theorizing
How they killed Biggie Smalls
2Pac and Malcolm X
How they killed them all
Be a leader on the block
You taking over the game
But instead of gangbanging
And acting selfish
You like a Panther in the morning
Serving breakfast

[Verse 5: Lah Tere]
I'm getting my guerrillas on
Ready to die
For all my people
After we done, there's gon' be no sequel
Bringing our lyrics of mass destruction
Fighting corruption
This is my introduction
I'm getting my guerrillas on
Ready to die
For all my people
After we done, there's gon' be no sequel[Intro]
You know what i'm saying
So i'm sitting here
Seeing people like Rosa Clemente
Like Cynthia Mckinney know what i'm saying?
Seeing people really talking about change
And i'm just, sometimes I just feel confused about all these things
Know what I mean? It goes like this, look

[Verse 1: RodStarz]
Whats up Barack I hope you find yourself exited
You banished the country and the hood seems to like it
I'm from Chicago man, we from the same home
I heard you used to work organizing with the poor
It's crazy from Hawaii I was born in [?]
I'm an immigrant too dawg in middle of three children
I know you know the feeling of perhaps being different
Of dreaming about the future and the hopes of better living
I like the fact you went to school
My ex girl went to Harvard
So I know first hand is you had to work the hardest
I like that you were honest about your smoking and your snortin
Cause it show me your not perfect in this hope for reforming
I wanted to reach out cause i'm now working in the Bronx
And it's so much neater here in the home of Hip-Hop
So I was wondering if you could start a dialog
Hopefully i'll hear back
Your biggest fan RodStarz

[RodStarz]
Man, we can't even deny the inspiration
That you've given to the hood
Everybody's talking about you
Everybody's wearing the t-shirts
Hip-hop's is getting politicized
But are we really saying? Man
What we really voting for?
Know what I mean?
What really going on?
What are you going do for the hood?
What change is really going to come to our community?
Look(ROD STARZ VERSE)
I promised I would rap like a superstar rap
Spit like a monster
Put myself on the map
First rap in English
Than rap in Spanish
Que lo que tu dice
Boy, I cause damage
International worldwide
Resistance in my lyrics
Walkin down these Mean Streets
To the House of Spirits
Yo represento lo que canto en mi canciones
Amor. Justicia. Hip hop revoluciones
Listen here
We done preachin' to the choir
We stayed on the block, took the neighborhood higher
I guess I just listen to the little voice speakin'
The one that said
"Never deny what u seekin'"
That made me a believer
Que todo es possible
Mi flow como la lucha
Siempre sigue
They call it ADD when u wildin' and don't listen
They make think you crazy if you question they system

(HOOK)
Call me Craaazy
Cuz I look different than you
Spark fear out the corner of yo' peripheral?
Call me Craazy
Like I'm the violent one
Livin' in the empire that was born out the gun
Now that's Craaazy
What I'm supposed to?
When they shut the stores down and there ain't no food?
Now that's Craaazy
Like I'm the violent one
Livin' in the empire that was born out the gun

(C RAYZ VERSE)
Crazy is as crazy does
Attack the industry wit a chainsaw
For a crazy buzz
What's crazy is $2.50 for a fare
Tryna get iced out
But its snow everywhere - yeaaah
A cold world we livin' in
Ol' girl, pimpin kin
I'm general Tso
Minus the boneless chicken
And the soul less victims
Homeless conditions
Why fight my brother?
When I can beat the system?
I write 16's in 16 minutes
(Impossible!)
That's what it is
But i know what it isn't
Crazy
The words Garvey spoke
The same slang as Malcolm
Man, it's too many quotes
The Wolf
Lickin' the blade
Thinkin' its kool-aid
Blood thirsty
Turnin' ourselves into slaves
Whats crazy is you in a gang
But won't do a god-damned thang
When the police bang
On the corners
We learn how to hang
With no more nooses
Just mad trees
The same old thang
What's crazy's how they control our brain
With these demonic songs
That that radio play
You a revolutionary?
Yeah, it's all good
But they don't know you in the hood
What's good!?
That's crazy!
And I don't got no time to look it
Crazy!
My straight jacket on crooked
Now that's crazy!

(HOOK)

(G1 VERSE)
Like I lost my marbles
Like all I wanna do is criticize and argue
Like my screws loose
Cuz I say what I want to
Shit say what I got to
Es por eso que canto
Queremos un cambio
En eso andamos
Yo creo caminos
No creo en obstaculos
You say I'm loco and need a doctor
I say, "lets be realistic and do the the impossible"
Check it out
I'm on a higher plane
Some say it sane
I say it okay
Let yo' mind sway
Ride the wave
Better that
Than on land and stuck in one place
They want you sedated
Drugged and medicated
More paper in the pockets of the drug fabricators
All indicators show our society's sick
Diseased by greed; that's the diagnosis

I'm with my family and my crew, Rebel Diaz
I'm with DJ Disco Wiz, a Latino pioneer
Cause it's dope when the elders break bread with the kids

[Verse 4: G1]
I'm for telling the truth, exposing the lies
Think about the dead soldiers when you're driving your ride
Them people died for the oil and Daddy Bush's revenge
I'm with the widows, the children, and the lonely best friends
I'm with Families Stayin' Together as ONE
I'm not for the raids and the deportations!
I'm with Victor Toro and the M.I.R
So watch out for those snitches in that unmarked car!
And for Lil Saulito, we gonna fight for your moms
So we gonna shout her out, twice in one song
I'm for twelve million workers and Elvira Arellano
I'm for a world without borders and a better tomorrow

[Hook][Intro]
You know what i'm saying
So i'm sitting here
Seeing people like Rosa Clemente
Like Cynthia Mckinney know what i'm saying?
Seeing people really talking about change
And i'm just, sometimes I just feel confused about all these things
Know what I mean? It goes like this, look

[Verse 1: RodStarz]
Whats up Barack I hope you find yourself exited
You banished the country and the hood seems to like it
I'm from Chicago man, we from the same home
I heard you used to work organizing with the poor
It's crazy from Hawaii I was born in [?]
I'm an immigrant too dawg in middle of three children
I know you know the feeling of perhaps being different
Of dreaming about the future and the hopes of better living
I like the fact you went to school
My ex girl went to Harvard
So I know first hand is you had to work the hardest
I like that you were honest about your smoking and your snortin
Cause it show me your not perfect in this hope for reforming
I wanted to reach out cause i'm now working in the Bronx
And it's so much neater here in the home of Hip-Hop
So I was wondering if you could start a dialog
Hopefully i'll hear back
Your biggest fan RodStarz

[RodStarz]
Man, we can't even deny the inspiration
That you've given to the hood
Everybody's talking about you
Everybody's wearing the t-shirts
Hip-hop's is getting politicized
But are we really saying? Man
What we really voting for?
Know what I mean?
What really going on?
What are you going do for the hood?
What change is really going to come to our community?
LookA contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?
A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?

[Verse 1]
How can a government say they support human rights
When we know they only fight with dollar signs in their eyes
So it’s relief for the tsunami, money for the tidal wave
They’ve lost just as many lives in Africa from AIDS
In my country tis of thee, how come there’s poverty
If it’s Homeland Security, why the hell you watching me
And how come I go to college all the professors is white
All the students look alike like they related to the dean
Education ain’t a right, man education is a dream
A diploma is equivalent to getting a receipt
How do all the founding fathers look like officer friendly
How does Jesus look related to the cops that apprehend me
How you make your commericals, say it does a body good
Then take extacy and steroids so you can look and feel good
How many judges and lawyers still use cocaine
Then their Rockefeller laws keep my people enslaved

A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?
A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?

[Verse 2]
How can the richest country have so many homeless
Cause ten percent of the evil people got the money, you should know this
What’s a black republican, what’s a Latin bush supporter
And if Bush loves the war, he should send his own daughters
What’s a liberal guy that supports women’s rights
And on that very same day watches porn all night
If there’s freedom of speech, then what’s censorship
And how the hell you wearing Jordans and you root for the Knicks
How come hip-hop got political around election day
Yet any other time ain’t got shit to say
How many communists drive home in nice ass cars
To the comfort of a home with a stocked up bar
How Chicago the second city when we always in first
And if you don’t support Cuba, take off the Che shirt
A contradiction, yo it’s the root of our system
And if there’s really justice
Why it’s just us in the prisons

A contradiction, but ain’t that what it’s all about?

[Verse 3]
Why does the Christian right support a war that’s taking people’s lives
How many revolutionaries done beat up their wives
How many married men still take part in the chase
How come so many doctors do drugs to stay awake
And what about them priests that are secretly gay
Yet they still preach the word every single Sunday
And how many politicians have no social skills
Why so many millionaires don’t pay child support bills
And if a woman sleeps around then for sure she’s a ho
Yet when a man does his thing he must be full of mojo
Why do jocks take drugs just to hit home runs
Why you shopping for clothes with insufficient funds
Why you driving a Mercedes with no milk for the baby
Rolling on twenty-twos when your rent is past due
A contradiction, yeah that’s what it’s about
I just gave a few examples for you to think about(RODSTARZ VERSE)
I can't front im upset that they took our buildin
Next Thing the Comandante man I know they killed him
Something goin on I gotta read the signs
Somethin telling me that its about that time
Time to step it up cuz I still smell sulfur
Still smell the money in this capitalist culture
So im dedicatin verses to my boy jamil
He out there in Venezuela.. Frontline its real!
Hunts Point New York 2005
That's when I realized the revolution soo alive
We ain't never had a president come around mine
He brought OIL for the poor in the wintertime
He showed Love to the Bronx that's called Solidarity
We show love back ain't no politician scarin me
Anti imperialist til I we go delirious
The work is getting serious....that's why they keep fearin us!!

(CHORUS)
Do the mathematics Hugo Chavez was the baddest
I gotta work Chavez... (2X)
In Caracas
El proceso va palante
In Chicago
El proceso va palante
In the South Bronx
El proceso va palante
It goes worldwide
El proceso va palante

(G1 VERSE)
Forward
This movement ain't defeated
La lucha sigue
Dentro de todos esa rebeldia existe
La CIA comete crimen
Igual las ideas viven
Aqui el pueblo decide
No lo que los medios dicen
Queren parar una cultura alternativa
Fijate desde el bronx hasta america latina
Capitalista van
Capitalista vienen
Buscan tus bienes
Queren hacer lo que queren
Ahora decimos NO!
No al imperialismo
Al neoliberlismo
Los bancos
Los ricos
Ni un millonario
Chavez fue solidaario
Ni Bush ni Obama llegaron a ayudarnos
No lo olvidamos
Mas que Venezolano
Esto cruza frontera
Hip hop bolivariano
America unida
Como creamos ese frente?
Solidaridad por todo el continente!

(CHORUS)
