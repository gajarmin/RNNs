[Verse 1: King Chip]
I'm just what you made God - not many I trust
I'mma go my own way, God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryin' to get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin' bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush, that big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on" she said, "Naw, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, endless shopping, I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world of trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

[Hook]

[Outro]
Need it to get by, ya
Willy[Chip Tha Ripper]
Now baby I'm the ripper, your baby daddy's worst nightmare
Catch me by the Clair, I'll be right there
Niggas copy everything we say
Louie frames, eyes lower than my G.P.A
Riding and swerving, Kush I'm blown
Doors wide my trunk bump like Eddy Road
I don't cake hoes, I never tip the stripper
I'm rich bitch but you can call me Cheap tha Ripper
Shell toes, yes. P.R.P.S
There's a man riding a horse on top of my chest
Polo fresh, I am ze man
I be slam dunking Tanqueray shots with LeBron
Told niggas keep it Carmelo, okay
Rolled past Dave told him hello and hey
Me and Cash in something old on 23's ho
Back window says "Mama Mel Bicho"
Skateboarders grind, I grind too
That's why you can catch me in D.C. shoes
I quit the team but believe I'm balling
Want a verse, put up a stack or quit calling
30's on my Chevrolet call me super duper
Garage like Roots I got more whips than Kunta
Riviera sitting on the Bulls best hooper
Y'all still riding 20's, y'all some oompa loompas
Doors swang on niggas that got bad behavior
My four 15's woke up the neighbors
Interior crocodile alligator
I drive a Chevrolet movie theater
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!![Verse 1: King Chip]
If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in 92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas go'n eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be (x4)
Hey yo, all right

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they neva change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin got them sucka niggas hatin
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' bout crack or we talkin about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin, they fixin' to run up
Then they gettin the come up, yup bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If its a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad my nigga

[Hook][Hook: Game]
I'm tryin' to go to church
Get some chicken wings, after that hit the strip club
See some hoes, TWERK!
See bad girls be at the strip club
Good girls, they be in church!
Always wonder why my grandmother
Try to get me to go to church
Please Lord forgive me, I'm bout to take niggas to church

[Verse 1: Game]
Christian Louboutins, they're my best friends
I'm bout to put these bitches to the test then
What ya callin' spikes? What color that box?
Is that a white bag in it? Yea? No? Hold up. Stop
You ain't bout that life (bout that life)
You ain't bout that life
You don't bounce that ass like, "Oh Lord!"
Then climb back up the pole to meet Christ
Saturday night, she twerkin' it for a real nigga
These niggas hatin', I hate them niggas
Make me wanna bring back Tommy Hilfiger
I'm in love wit' a stripper, cue to that nigga T-Pain
Said I love dem' strippers, word to my nigga 2 Chainz
Got a leather Ferrari, Eddie Murphy pants
Ya strippin? Go on twerk it then, cause' after this

[Hook]

[Bridge: Trey Songz (and Game)]
I know this ain't the first night
Go on girl, just do your thang
Don't be actin' shy
Take a sip and just do it babe
Sittin here all night (just do it for me)
Don't waste no time girl (just do it for me)
Girl I pray that, me and you lay down
Come on baby, lay down, go on, lay down
Tomb Raider, sooner or later
The way you move that ass so innovative
Go on, baby, lay down
(CHURCH!) Thicker than a Bible
(CHURCH!) I need it for survival
(CHURCH!) Lord save me!
(CHURCH!) Poppin' bands for my baby

[Verse 2: Game]
I'mma crucify that pussy, I'mma nail it here, I'mma nail it there
I'mma mail it here, I'mma mail it there, doin' all this sippin' Belvedere
Gotta sheriff here and a baliff here, all we missin is a judge
One night with a random bitch, and she'll burn your ass like a rug
Real niggas gon' say that, real niggas don't play that
Real nigga'll take a basic bitch, then close the trunk of that Maybach
Open the trunk to that Maybach, roll the bitch in that water
Conscience start gettin the best of you, gotta pull a ho outta that water
Try to make some sense of it, tell a ho she got baptized
Put a couple hundreds in her Trues, tell a ho to get her act right
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
Red bottoms will make her fuck; you broke niggas don't stand a chance
CHURCH!

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3: King Chip]
King Chip, eastside Cleveland ghetto mogul
You say, "Damn, you livin like that?"
I say, "Bitch, I told you."
Sunday mornin, extra clean, get these bitches off of him
I'mma roll through your hood, and collect my offering
Seen her wit a group of friends, damn she got the best butt
Then she turned around, lookin like Morris Chestnut
Aww, hell no, God damn. What the fuck?
Even though shit a nigga still might fuck
You can be my "Plan C," just in case my "A" and "B" can't cut
Guess what? A nigga so fresh to death, I'm decomposin'
I just copped a dope ass condo, just to keep some hoes in
What I'm gon' do with all these racks?
Damn, what she gonna do with all that ass?
That baby oil is Holy Water
Ever met a young nigga with too much cash?
Her baby daddy live by my words
Damn, she cold, she got them curves
Double parked outside of the club
Niggas like, "Damn, nigga got some nerves"
Smokin' these L's in the pulpit
With OG Chuck in the cool bitch
Got ten thousand all in ones cause, damn, that ass is stupid (Haha!)

[Bridge][Intro]
This is easy, Sunday morning
We're right here on a beautiful morning in
Cleveland, Ohio
And it's chilly today
Kids are going to school
The grass is frosty

[Verse 1: Chip The Ripper]
This should be my theme song to life
A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
"Wonder what them folks on?"
That's what they be asking
That kush we smokes on
Smell it when a nigga pass and
We getting to the cash and
You can see a nigga shining
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find em
Unless he out on the road
Every show got a bag for the blow and Patron all my niggas getting throwed
Like they posed to
Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just pull out that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out and free my scalp
I need to free my mind, a puff at a time
I'm up all the time
I'm up on the grind
So a Red bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Dont really like sipping cause I get to tripping
My nigga just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a lil bit for the trip
In case we get blurped by the 5-0
"Sir you look high.."
"I know, but I prefer my eyes get low"

[Refrain]
And we get higher, and higher and higher and higher
And we get higher, and higher and higher and higher
You know we get higher and higher and higher and higher
You know we get higher and higher and higher and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Ooh, yeah we get so high

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Yeahhh
They say easy friend, there he go talking about weed again
Probably cause all that weed in him
Yes and no, cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad, or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
But your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and
Tag along
And we float
We kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss what
A nigga trying to get you thinking about
We outside cause my Mama in the house
Puss, puff pass with your bitch ass
Back in high school, smoke weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict
Tragic, stay rolling up while reclining happy
I be looking down see my Jesus piece shining
G.O.O.D. look Yeezy
Now I stay blinded by light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going
I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, i'll be chilling Jack
Let's go

[Refrain][Nicole Wray: Hook]
I’d never do it again
Do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end
This is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again(hey)
Do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

[Verse 1: GLC]
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable snow man
Old man when you trying to shine like gold
When its my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was here with highs and low
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now im sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And pachanga so im watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, its better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way *that* I watch a stranger

[Hook]

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Chilling rolling up something to change my feeling
Thinkin about how I came up from nothing while i’m
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it, won't trust him again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Cheese came through at 3
Salute at ease he supplied the weed
Cause Ibn had OD
Its me with a black rockstar steez
Real rock tees, $300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t owe me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heinie with my Jamie boo besides me
That's my fucking best friend
When I be tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off I am, I am, I am
I see that im caught I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think thats the part I find intriguing, im fiending

[Nicole Wray: Outro]
I’ll never do it again
Do it again[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
First of all, my dog, back off
Ash Roth top five right now, better know that
But rap without me is like braidless Moesha, Kobe with no Shaq
But when I'm on the mic all I get is blank stares
No cares, it's a slow clap
But just because you rapping like "Da-da-da-da-da-da"
Doesn't mean you really rap
I can't grasp how these broke asses claiming to be rich
But really get no cash
I been to your whack show, what you call that, bro?
25 people at home with a cat?
You go posting like "Yo it was packed, it was dope
It was girls from the front to the back"
All these cum rags keep comparing white rappers with Asher
But everybody knows I'm the dad
For the craft, or a laugh, not a tad outlasted
I don't really care what you say
10 years from now I'ma still love college
While I'm fucking white girls out in Arizona State
I'm sick of hearing all the hoes you be having
How much dro you be smoking, homie no you don't
You showed up with bros
Here's a RAW paper, do you even know how to roll?
Let it go like my hair length
I'm gonna quit rap start it better I'm gonna play bass guitar
Me, Chevy, Chip, and Dumbfounded
What should we call it?
Hmm, How about RAW?

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I been wakin' up everyday, doing the fuck I want
All I need is for shit to be cool, and pass that fuckin' blunt
Nigga never gave no fuck about police, I piss all on their grave
Justice for Mike Brown, you son of a bitches gon' be held to pay
I got the severed hands of 100 cops up out my chariot
What if every hood united? That would be some scary shit
Way more niggas than cops
You too sure nigga how to do anything
3D print my SK, walk in TSA, couldn’t say anything
I walked in like a real one, ready to kill somethin'
Its impossible to hear my voice, and not feel nothin'
Suck a black dick, Bill O'Reilly fuck you
I'm King Chip I say exactly what I want to
Nigga never gave no fuck ‘bout politics, I got the power, bitch
4 bedroom house, in my living room I got a lot of chicks
Smokin’ fool… Nigga, we smokin' fools
How does it feel to be wearing a chain that's way more dope than you?

[Verse 3: $kinny]
I be that same nigga with a whole lot of jewels, whole lot of hoes, whole lot of O’s, blow whole lot of O’s, whole lot of guns blow whole lot of holes, home full of holes, whole full of fuck yous, whole lot of crews that’ll ride for me, die for me, pry for me, rob for me, probably get caught by the cops for me, cop drops for niggas that’ll lie for me. And if you wanna pop off let it pop off. In a benz with the top off with some drop offs. In the tint it’ll be hotboxed you’ll be hot sauce with some twins in the lunchbox full of pot roast. ????
I be up in cairo with the pharaohs
I be up in cabo with dineros
On the beach with a barrel full of arrows
Y'all can't bang with us hang with us
Bunch of fuckin' traderers, strangerers
Never see me paperless, I’m angel dust
Dope boy straight dangerous, irregulars
I’m the same nigga you love to hate
Must be the bands i make
Must be the pounds i make
Must be the way i bang LA
Must be the whip i brought around the town today
Must be the bitch i flew in outta town today
Must be the shit i blew up in the Mandalay better do what the camel say
Few goons from France saint tropez. Haters go scramblé

[Verse 4: Chevy Woods]
Young dope sellin' nigga
4800 got the coke sellin' nigga
Now all these wannabe friends see us real now they wanna try and coattail a nigga, but
Ha.. look I ain't for it, dodge on them niggas nah this ain't ford
211 when they run it back to me now that’s what I call a raw report
That Honda accord, three chickens in a wheel well
Lil nigga when it come to that kitchen you know I know that shit real well
Yea, say hi to me, the nigga who they sayin' wouldn't be shit
Oh, look and I'm Randy Savage ?? Yo bitch want the beef stick
That’s cold, see this watch here cost a new home
Look baby I’m ballin' watch these shooters get you outta that zone
You talkin' like you gettin' to the money, you ain't gettin' to the money pussy leave me alone
Ha…. Ha…
And I never keep shit at my home
Niggas always talkin' that killa shit but they don’t know no motherfuckin' killas
They say I always rap about drug sellin' cuz I was out on that corner with the dealers
You see I’m doin' this so I’m ain't gotta go back to that book bag full of that work
And a pussy ass nigga tried to set me up same pussy ass nigga that got merked
If you bang that shit, nigga claim that shit, see me I don’t fuck with that side, try me better look out your window I have them niggas waitin' in that car parked outside
I ain't ever get no money with you broke ass niggas, never told y'all who’s the connect
Ima always be 4800 nigga real shit homies on the set
Shoes off, champagne, steak well done not the crib this is all on a jet
They don’t wanna give it to me imma take my shit either way imma get my respect
Free all my niggas that’s locked in the cage when they touch down they gon' see
And tell them pussy ass niggas don’t copy my shit and you know that’s TGOD fuck nigga
Oooohhhh!!Yea
Chip, check it out
25 wives
Wish I could have...
If I could have 25 wives..

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Just me with all y'all, that'd be so wonderful
Make daddy proud: I love every one of you
My angels - I feel like Flava Flav but sexier
The sex is gonna be messier
But ain't gonna be no stress in here
We living good all of us, we winning, that's obvious
We got whips, Cars R Us, we smoke good: it's foggy
Plus the status: they all mad at us
Teamwork: that's our recipe for living lavish
Yeah, we get this cabbage
I'm the head coach of the team
If everybody play their position, we can win this thing
Called life, happiness, liberty, freedom
If I got all y'all, there won't be no sense in cheating
Y'all the truth, got a connection with you all
Ambisexuals. If this ain't Heaven what's it called?
Must be life. No greater feeling in the world
If I had 25 wives, I would love all my girls..

[Hook] x2
I wish I could have 25 wives
We'd all get it poppin, we'd all get high: that's fly
If I could have 25 wives
I'd love them all like they love me
We hustle to survive

[Verse 2: Wale]
Got women in every city. Winning in every city
Her body's been paranormal since buying that pair of titties, look
Silicone bitches got the confidence
But natural bitches get all my compliments
I ain't trying to conflict: Nickels to dimes and shit
Make something out of nothing. Nigga, I MacGyver that bitch
Niggas wild as shit. No rubber, just climb in that bitch
Take your hat off and get to cuttin: Kung Lao on that bitch
Mortal Kombat, my shit is beyond rap
I keep it 100 nigga: Warren Moon, Warren Sapp
Hit, I never call her back. Bet she keep on coming back
You keeping her dry, shit, I named that bitch "Tsunami Cat"
I'm too polished, I ain't looking for acknowledgement
Put my squad on my back like I'm wearing me a starter jacket
Yall lame niggas. No bitches when yall are out
I get that Ivy League brain, catch me with a Dartmouth

[Hook] x2

[Outro: Wale]
It's Double M-G yo
It's nothing but a motherfucking undefended free throw
I'm getting each ho
Eyes lower than Ichiro[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Forever like...
The first time I heard Big L speak
And Biggie Smalls did a song with some niggas from street
Thats when I knew it was possible
Now what I got to do?
Fuck it I'm just gonna do everything that they told me not to do
Cause I ain't got a clue
All I got is Duke
And a whole city behind me who the fuck is you?
No slack from niggas thats how they come up
In my hood they shoot so much we dont even duck. for what?
Fitted king they be like damn he to clean
My city is shawshank and im andy dufrain my mane
Cause once you think im sleeping I'm grinding
I swear I hit the turnpike like every week to go find it
Some say the kid ahead of his time
But the only thing popping is birettas and nines
In the city where niggas slit wrists? and stay rich
Nigga might have it on him but I bet he won't say shit
The realest....[Verse 1: Big Sean]
OK, I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, when it's not fall
I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm an avatar
I pick up a O from, my nigga Ralphy
My bro and me, but he is not alphy
Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy, Damn, if you ain't know
I made these girl night, smoke a paper and bowls
My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now catch you getting brain if a nigga not learning
I be spending money if a nigga not earning
Catch me in the backseat if I'm not stirring
And I be rolling up if a nigga not burning, boy

[Hook:]
I got five on it
Have your bowl and get beat
I got five on it
Nothing with that endo weed
I got five on it
If you got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Now let's go hop outside

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper:]
You know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky
Try to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
Cause this shit I blow can get smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans every thing you need is in stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo dolo, when you see me blowing on some weed
Why speed, no need, I be just taking it slow
I be so clean, diesel over powers my cologne
Now all the bad bitches who blazed on shifting this way
Y'all just some white belts, with leaves I am the sensai
Now bow to the bag never, save the best for last
When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack, let's cop a quarter pound now
What the fuck is you gon' put down?
Nigga I got five

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
How wired, 6-4 hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys, I was high partna'
Fuck you want? This the raw paper not a blunt
You must, got me mixed up with Chip cause, This Spitta
Zig zag a whole zip up, shit strong shoulda' came with a bed pick up
Bitches calling me, wanna smoke beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa'
That weed you smoking brown, fake weed to much make up, clown
Get real smoking green, strawberry fields
High standing up feelin' like I'm layin' down, couple bugie Judy's came round
Actin' all stuck up, now they just stuck from smokin' with us
Had the hallway smellin', Is my windows opening enough?
I hear walkie talkies, Is security coming up?
Fuck

[Hook][Intro: Kent Jamz]
6996, 6997, 6998, 6999, woah

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
I think I slept with about 7000 girls
I think I slept with about 7000 girls
I ain't bragging
It ain't attractive
I ain't bragging baby
It ain't attractive

[Kent Jamz]
I remember popping your new girlfriend's cherry
Bumping the Carter 3
You took her to the bridge
I took her virginity
I don't need no more enemies
I gotta tell the truth
Fucked her in my backseat
Ate her out she gave me head too

[Childish Gambino]
Used to love smashing
Poetic nigga so she chase passion
Throwing feelings in my songs that she love catching
From the windows to the walls, skeet skeet action
Mmmm, I'll get the towel
My car like wow, my girl like wow
But if I charm another, she go buck wild
Check the profile
Tell me how you wanna let the chips fall
Cause you know I'm fucking and I won't call
Bino too real, Bino too real
Ain't got no chill, ain't got no chill
At the festival, the top of the lineup
He still need a line up
His clothes not designer
We don't have to be sad no more
We don't have to fuck girls on tour
We ain't gotta make moves like this
Now we only hang with bad ass chicks
Who smoke bad ass weed
And wanna listen to music and chill..
And hangout.. thats all

[Hook]

[Joon]
Well uh
My journey started off [?]
Seventeen years old when I lost my virginity
So what, I was kinda late
Thought I was doing something
'til I went to Arizona State
Do you remember the joy you had first time you nutted on the face?
Trinidad James sound effect
Started pantomiming what the porns do
Shout out to all the chicks I hit in my Hassayampa dorm room
Got my own spot that said [?] with my nigga Chuck [?]
I had the blue Tahoe, he had the red Charger on them dubs too
So of course them hoes would come through
Nineteen with high dreams and dough too
I was living comfortable as the doctor shows you
Getting head from girls while I'm trying to get they sister
Plus I had blue [?] on deck, so you know what was in my system
Fucked some girls I'm glad I did
And some girls I'm glad I didn't
I fucked so many bitches, a nigga should've been pimping
Fell in love with a one night stand
Call me the one night man
Never learned how to treat a lady 'til I loved you

[King Chip]
I need a bed big enough to fit 200 bitches
I fucked some broke bitches, I fucked bitches with riches
I had some hoes fuck me just cause my [?]
She fucked me cause I'm in that Black Jesus episode
She fucked me cause she want a chance at being on display
She want that Kim K, Amber testimony everyday
She want that 'rari and that condo on Rodeo
I'm a run the lettuce separate
She gone pump the mayo
She out here recruiting, she interviewing
She ask them if they [?] or shooting
Put that work and nothing to it
I say,"Oh, this yo jam, well we should be nutting to it."
I say, "Oh, this yo jam, and we should be cutting to it."

[Hook]

[Sleazy]
See I like black girls, and them Puerto Ricans
Them independent chicks that only party on the weekends
I got like four ex's: they all caught me cheating
A couple did me shady, but that ain't why we ain't speaking
Now they got boyfriends, they trying to treat 'em decent
I got a chick from Vegas, man she like keeping secrets
Only hit me on the weekends, talking dirty when we texting
Like, "Do you remember the time in the back of my mommas Lexus?"
Sure I do, when I gave you that pearl necklace
Got stains all on the leather acting so reckless
I love them ghetto girls, but fucking hate the drama
Lie and say they allergic to condoms, trying to be my baby mama
7000 girls but they all the same mayne
Tell you that they love you
I swear they run the game mayne
You really wasting time if you're trying to understand
Just beat that pussy up and send em on they way

[Hook][Verse 1: King Chip]
King Chip in this bitch, valet park the chariot
When I'm walking on rose petals I ain't hearing it
Can't tell me shit with $30,000 shoes on
Even if I'm is wrong, naw nigga you wrong
Damn these bitches love me, they say I should be in movies
I just signed with the C.A.A., they wish just might come truly
Hell yes she's got that booty, do I got to say it
That head and pussy crazy, type I got to spend the day with
Niggas see me on TV and be like damn Chip you made it
But, if you ask me I need a few more toys to play with
Bitch don't stare too long cause your panties will get creamy
I was looking like a natural king like every time you see me

[Hook: King Chip]
7-8 rings
And you know a nigga rock 'bout 7-8 rings [x8]

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I'm the coldest nigga who is ever on this earth, ho
Yee ain't tryna ball out then what the fuck you work for
People only doubt you cause they know for sure that they can't
I been spending so much paper, damn I need to take a vacay
Put me in a place where I can walk around and buy shit
Put me in a place where it's some bitches on some fly shit
Reminder bitch, you got a stupid question not to ask
Trigger finger ringless case I gotta pop your ass
Get these niggas heads chopped like the king that I am
Eating like a mob boss, little chubby yea I am
If you fuckin with a real king ain't no losing
Told these bitches kiss the ring just to let me know they choosin
Catch me on Twitter going ham on the pastures
King Chip ain't no bitch, father I'm a master
Sippin some patrossi, with some bitches in the posse
Whippin up millions on my iPhone and I know my ghetto got me

[Hook]King Chip

A nigga just left out landmarks
On 55th and I’m feelin’ well
Told my nigga Ma$e
Before he got locked up I was gonna give him hell

Reminiscing my past life
As a young nigga tryna hit a lick
Only thing you can say about chip
Is that nigga cold in that denim shit

I’m all in the hood politics
If you pop in then they watching you
Just found out this badass bitch
In cleveland heights was prostitute

These hoes wanna fuck with the king
Cuz they heard I got lots of loot
Bitch ass nigga wanna pose a threat to a real king
Then I got to shoot

Blow these ho nigga heads off
Then I’m headin off to feelin good
Moved out to ? 55
Might catch a nigga in hollywood

My uncle is laying down
I’m used to seein him breathing
Came back home for a funeral
THis ain’t nothin new this cleveland

I’m lookin forward to never lookin back again
Cuz I’m a dad now
All that young shit I was on can’t take it back
But that’s dead now

Damn I done got my mind right
4 blunts rolled and a double cup
Perfect as I wanna be
Got no stress cuz I don’t give no fuck

Chorus

And it’s 7am on St. Clair
It’s 7am
7am on St. Clair
7am

My nigga it’s 7am on st. clair
And I’m feelin good
Nigga I can float through any hood
Nigga I float through any hood

Ray Cash

Started from the bottom
Started from the gutter
And she in my bed

You know I get bread
Better believe that pussy’s butter
She give good head

I used to get bread
With her older brother
Til the judge gave him two

But he kept it true
You know old girl do
Baby mother, yup
Small world

Nigga I’m just tryna function
Just licked a liq store on london
At the light just me and my weapon
At the marathon on 152nd

Police all in my sight
Pulled right to fuck up my night?
Sippin’ my double sprite life is a forty
Take me a sip as I ride by the forty

Double cup eases the pain
Molly all up in her drink
Kush in the air what is the Clair
We’re on 117

Shout out to my nigga Ma$e
Real niggas don’t talk
If this was st clair 2008
Then I’d be with my nigga hawk

I’m on 99th in my own head
Breakin bread cold chillin
Know real niggas from every hood
That’s on st. clair and that county building

I’m certified
East side of King
My bitch a 10 fine queen
Went down the way got on the freeway
Got off on Martin Luther King

Chorus

About 7am on St. Clair
It’s 7am
7am on St. Clair
7am

My nigga it’s 7am on St. Clair
And I’m smokin good
Nigga I can float through any hood
Nigga I float through any hood

It’s 7am on St. Clair
It’s 7am
7am on St. Clair
It’s 7am

My nigga it’s 7am on st. clair
And I’m feelin good
Nigga I can float through any hood
Nigga I float through any hood[Hook]x2
I'm a activist sipping actavis
In the back of this cadillac with this
Purple sprite
Know I'm thuggin know I'm feeling alright

[Verse one:]
Ain't nobody never gave no fuck about no nigga man
Know it nigga, smoking weed to help keep me sane
Rest in peace my nigga hawk he left me in 2011
Niggas ran up in his crib and hit him in his brain
Praying with my nigga dog, care for my nigga lord
Help a young nigga while I try to find my way
Damn it was my nigga dog, care for my nigga lord
Help a young nigga, I just bought this new AK
Weaving, bob and weaving throwing punches at the world
Yeah I'm fighting back cause I ain't no ho
Grieving, my niggas dying
Niggas changing on me not that I got money
I ain't got no where to go
Theres so many people in the world with so many problems
Wonder who would give a fuck about mine
Paid 350 for the pint 2 liter sprite
Yeah this shit is dirty nigga had a long night

[Hook]

As I pour another cup
I think to myself
The only thing worth getting heard in my life
Is what you take the sin up out my life
As I pour another cup
As I pour another cup
As I pour another cup, my niggas

[Verse two]
Stress never the less a nigga blessed
Frustrated cause I know I'm better than this
Alone, I am alone, alone is me
Prone cause in my zone to be a G
The world told me lies, killed my friends
The world, fuck the world till it ends
Got a pint for the night, treat it like gold
I need more stress gone I'm moving slow

[Hook][Intro]
Stay without me
Stay without me
When your head goes down
When your head goes down
When your head goes down

[Verse 1: Lorine Chia]
I think they crazy, I think they really try to play me
Their whole approach was just to faze me
Their action plan is just to change me
You won't change me
I'm seeing everything for what it is and what it's 'possed to be
I pray the Lord is watching over me
This crazy world just took a toll on me
Won't take control of me, no longer be afraid
I'm hip to all their plans and mental games
Wisdom is gone and they call it change
Old friends are acting like we're not the same

[Hook]
Stay without me
Stay without me
When your head goes down
When your head goes down
When your head goes down
When your head goes down
Stay without me
Stay without me
When your head goes down
When your head goes down

[Verse 2: King Chip]
This bitch-ass world keep lying to me
A nigga was blind but now I see
My heart is pure but now I know
The world around me is way too low
Maybe that's why a nigga so high
Plant seeds so a nigga won't die
Get sent to jail, pay rent on time
Get sent to hell, nigga still gonna shine
My legacy is way beyond
My vital signs, I am a God
I can't describe first time I figured that the Bible lie
That's why I trust no organism
King Chip fear none now
Middle take I sent to his daughter again
Goddamn, it's going down
What you gonna do when camouflages banging on the door where you lay?
Tell the cops you got sent to watch
Can't postpone this here and you can't dodge
They gave our leaders cancer, Anne Russo, RIP
Newton William Cooper, damn, feel like he wrote that book for me
King Chip[King Chip]
Have us a good time, and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around, nigga slide by,
Have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, got some friends around me
(x2)

[Michael Bolton](Bridge)

[Hook]
But I'm from where you get no love
Just a bunch of killers
There ain't no love here
Just a bunch of killers [x6]

[Verse 1]
I'm blessed to not have to deal with emotions
When niggas act lіkе bitches thеу send em Lake Eerie floating
Thе hood I come frοm raised mе tο bе one οf thе сοldеѕt
I stay out the way get thіѕ paper these niggas vultures
I try tο stay thе realest nigga I can be at all times
Nothing уου саn tеll mе far аѕ I’m concerned they all lying
Everybody full οf shit ѕο I dο mу own thing
Keep mу circle tight niggas scheming I don't fuck with these lames
Long as I'm maintaining nigga I ain’t complaining
I mаkе shit happen when it's fucked up I don't do no blaming
What's that gonna gеt me? Nothing
I’m trying to get me something
Helicopters flying cause niggas аrе dying from semis busting
Mу nigga Hawk told me gο in thе house at ten o'clock
He ѕау ain’t nο future іn thе streets dog this shit is hot
Lot οf niggas don’t advance in life because they dumb as fuck
Onlу one thing on they mind is coming up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rіding down St. Clair
High as fuck I don’t care
Floating through thе hood аt night
Crack thе window bless the air
Only puff the best in here
Take away the stress no fear
Niggas sure get mesѕed up here
AK Smith & Wesson yeah
Niggas learn thе lesson here
I'm wiser than the rest appear
I fuck wіth thеm professors here
Want O.G. gеt thе message see it
That's that type οf shit that be
On mу mind while I bе
Zoning rolling blowing trying to percept this reality
Ladies look аt mе lіkе I сουld take thеm tο thе fantasy
I take thе tο thе liquor store tеll thеm get some Hennessey
Then we to the crib see what she can do and all that
If she got a cold swag baby I’ll call back
I don't trust these hoes they set you up fast jack
Niggas at your head thеу find уου where уουr stash at
Best thing to do is chunk a deuce when I roll through
And try to stay true cause that's what real niggas do

[Hook][Intro: Christian Bale]
Think for one fucking second, what the fuck are you doing? Are you professional or not? No! No! Don't shut me up!

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Ex-juvenile delinquent
Yes, relapse when I fuck with Jameson
I'm thinking 'bout death like it's pussy in my mind
And the vibe, and I'm feelin like life's so lame
Heaven's probably iller, with way more babes
Way more ways to get faded
My first album was emo? What the fuck
Cats tryna play me, now I gotta show 'em what is what
I'm the one who comes when you're feeling so numb
You're the one who runs so I'm the one who hunts you
Hoes try to remember it's so fun to confront you
I am the rager, I am forever
Half of the time most the time I'm blunted
If I die it wouldn't all be for nothing
And all my life I'm doin what I wanna
So I'm livin' in the moment til God push the button on me

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half stepping
Over here we ain't half stepping
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half stepping
Over here we ain't half stepping

[Verse 2: Chip tha Ripper]
I'm a cold young man Midwest Cleveland representer
My bitch could take your bitch home with her
I'm hot and cold, but never lukewarm
And niggas always talking 'bout what they can do for 'em
I'm the prince I came royal penis stay clean
All the shit that I seen you can only day dream
Runnin my city since I was 18
The coldest, so fuck what a hater might think
Chillin on the higher side of the clouds
Life was nothing like life is now
Just wanna have a couple dollars on deck
And change their perspec I'mma aim for the neck
In the club I see you niggas jumping up and down sweating
Only for attention
Pathetic
You only paid twelve hundred dollars for that old school
Name dropping ass nigga, don't nobody know you

Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin

I can show you how to do this lame nigga
Uneducated nigga I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do this lame nigga
Uneducated nigga I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do this lame nigga
Uncultured motha fucka I can show you how to do it

Over here we ain't half steppin

[Outro: LCD Soundsystem]
Talking like a jerk except you are an actual jerk and living proof[Hook: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Verse 1: King Chip]
Thanks for having me Tony, you know
She got money from her last two exes
No kids, new Jag, new Lexus
And cook a bad ass breakfast
Just incredible, how the sex is
So I leave her but then I come right back
She be catchin' attitude and I don't like that
Wanna talk that shit, I'mma strike back
Only for the makeup sex and the night cap
They got a bed on the beach and
My thing got beef with your coochie
Got money, still sneak in the movie
Love the adventure and when you do me
I heard last man, soft ass friend like macho man
Lil' tight ass shirt on, let's just call him not your man
I'm just saying

[Hook: Tony Williams]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
F.G., all these, freak bitches wanna sex me
But due to the fact I'm a mac with a mothafuckin' sack
Man a bitch can't stress me
I'm with Alicia, Lauren, and Leslie
Miami rooftop Cabana
Heard they fucked my crew from Atlanta
Now I'm tryna hit it so pardon my manners
I was born with it so pardon this pimpin'
Can't learn nothin' talkin', bitch listen
Need a thick rare thing up in my bed frame
You look like you fit that description
Get up in the GT and get missin'
Push button start, the keyless ignition
Whole damn thing, it cost me 240
'Fore I left the lot I slapped it on Forgi’s, uh
And it don't really matter what you do
Cause I don't know another chick like you
From the back to the front to the side
Ain't another nigga doin' it like I do
Smoked out, I'm toasted
Fucked the bitch and made her lose focus
Off another dose of this dope dick
Tell all your friends, girl, promote this it's Gibbs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: King Chip]
You know a nigga need that one thing
She want a nigga that's stunting
Every time she pitch, I grand slam
Say her man be bunting
Well tonight, we going hunting
She like women like I do
Damn, well tonight we can try two
Damn, where the fuck a nigga find you?
You know a nigga mentally fucked up
Prolly on the bud, walk up in the club, get all the love
All because a nigga fucks with Cud
And even Kanye sees me, he says what's up
Tony I think I found the one
But she can't talk, her man is home
I told her save my name as Shaft Long in her damn phone

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Here’s another day in the life of a champion, knight
Do I do some fight, I’m ashamed but I might
Whether wrong, wheather right
Its a dangerous sight
Are we going in

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I’m feeling like Stevie right now, you know…
I had the strangest feeling lately
The nigga's so fake I'm off it
And every time they flake like frosted
I just make my profit
And get a girl who barely bra fit
Aw shit! He back on his feet like carpet
He was just playing possum
Playing like I wasn't awesome?
Yeah I got some jokes, don't I?
Ha ha ha, laugh it up
And they'll be wack
And we'll be the last ones cracking up
Matter fact, because you nigga wanna doubt me?
Let's see how it feel without me
Taking off on this rocket, Yao Ming

[Hook][Verse 1]
Ask a brand new baby bout me
Yea, ask your old lady bout me
Some girls say they can’t live without me
Broke hoes tryin to get babies out me
Nigga pulled up so extra clean
Swing my door, you smell that green
Bad ass bitch long hair don’t care
Look like she model for Maybelline
Chip go shopping every day
I just grab whatever I want
Make sure I take care of my shit
Young Cash [be?] number one
Boo, as soon as I picked you up
You should've gave me head in the car
You should fuck me now girl
Don’t wait til I’m a megastar
Riding through my crazy hood
Where you're not allowed to be
Pulled up on my nigga Mase
He said he was proud of me
If I ever caught that bitch nigga who murked Hawk
Sawed off shotty to the dome without no talk
My nigga ain’t make the news ’cause he was in the streets
Now the word is they don't give a fuck bout young black niggas like me
But fuck the world I’m swingin' to pay the ?
Sippin this purple, smoking tree with my companion
Yeah, we jammin damn it

[Hook]
A-A-A-A-Ask-ask
Ask a brandy new baby bout me

[Verse 2]
Ask a brand new baby bout me
You can ask your old lady bout me
Some girls say they can’t live without me
Broke hoes tryin to get babies out me
King Chip extra cold
Young boss extra bold
Nigga just really don’t give no fuck
Money is cool but I’d rather have gold
I’m bendin corners through my hood
What's up 117th
Flying down 105, Lakeview, where them killers be
? Road niggs don’t give no fuck
Shout out to the Sterns
Parked in front of that red wine house
With little C and that blunt gon burn
Free my nigga Monkey Dame
Free my nigga ?
I was right there when the judge gave my Lil State bout 38 years
Then victim’s wife took the stand and explained
How she found the her husband dead and I was like damn
They said my nigga pistol whipped him after he shot him
Some ho ass nigga took the stand and testified with no problem
Years later I’m living in Malibu Canyons
Sipping this purple, smokin tree with my companion
Yeah we jammin dammit

[Hook][Hook x2]
Rollin' puffin' indo, roll up all my windows
Wildin' with my kinfolk, for real tho'
Aye it's just chip tha rip and kiddo
It's just chip the rip and kiddo, (yeah)
Ask about me

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Dawg it's the weirdo again
I packed my bags back up in the land
Hoes talk down and then shake your hand
Believe me my nigga, supply and demand
I walked that line I learned them ropes
Did my thing I prayed and hoped
Now I'm getting back cuz my thick hoes wanna date
Put no limit just twerkin' and movin'
I stick and probe when I get it in then I might dip fast
If you focused you might cash
But not like Ray so please fall back
Live your life don't focus on money
Hello girl you can call me the moon man
Up above I fly fast anywhere nigga any given time a couple lines
Homeboy I ain't gotta rhyme so nice with it
And I keep that wahoo fitted
Flow was gravy, Bape, beige and navys
Back in high school hoes tried to diss me
Now all I gotta do is sing for a pretty thing
Give me five minutes, she all on my ding-a-ling
Can't live if you ain't about something
Can't talk if you live life frontin'
Boss life from invisible see a model then it's go time
Never handed it so I took mine
I didn't have a watch so I took time
Format it now they gotta jock it
My slim cut jeans haters try to knock it
Now them same mother fuckers keep 501's
10 Deep, bumpin' that slab up

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
I be on that-that-that monster shit
RAWR bitch, lot's of dick
If hoes get to beggin' that front door shall be their consequence
Get up outta here bitch, Cudi got some hoes comin'
And when them hoes come all they talkin' cummin'
Turn pike hustler that'll be I
Pullin' up to your city pretty high
And it's all for the rent, it's all for the fits
The money goes to the kush packs and the cigs
And the music I do it for the hoods and the kids
And the baby mamas who be in the hood with the kids
Do shit for the money fuck a favor
Text the address I'll see you later
M-I-A that's where I'll be
But for now I'mma G-R-I-N-D
Til a nigga caked up ain't worried bout shit
Meantime nigga better worry about Chip
Meantime nigga better worry bout clips
They gone be up in your ass if you talkin' that shit
To the wrong motherfucker from the jungle dog
Niggas out here come and hunt you down
Doors still be wide as a mother fucker
And them 15s be jumpin dog
Mister Don't-Give-A-Fuck is in the place
Louis shades, 700 on my face
Fresh scampi I'm loving that taste
Neva snitch, 12 hundred for the case
Me and Cudi here now what's good
You done fell off like we knew you would
Now I can show you how to be a real nigga be the coldest and still be true to your hood

[Hook] x4[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Yeah, as comfortable as a mug
The rug under my feet, you see it keeps me from pulling it up
I'm young, I got my lunch packed and brown bagged do not look fat
I even think I got a snack pack
And dad pays for gas in the hatch back front seat
Lean back when I leave it there he always gets mad
Turn the bass on the BOSE up to full let it blow roll the windows down and lets roll
I'm home
Feels so good knowing there's a bowl of cereal
And milk in the fridge when I wake every morn
Never fold my own laundry, dog are you feeling me?
I pay no bills, no rent, no utilities
As, good as it gets
But, no regrets
When I turn my back on it
Tell my parents I'm gone and
Don't wait up, be late when I make the name famous
The smile on my face size of the Great Lakes (Great Lakes)

[Verse 2: Whatzisface]
When I get back home I'm ma kick my feet up
Got man food to eat up
Went to take a poo
Who left my seat up? (what the?)
I read the paper while I'm pushing them trouble times
Plus, the can fit for a king, wiping with double ply
Toothbrush new, and clean my shoes with it, yep man
Shower all clean no pubes in a wet drain
No dudes on my couch, or chicks in my crib
But just a, ill that I rolled, and a six in my fridge
I got my, hand on my balls while I hang up my drawers
And wіth my, full on pause I ain’t taking nο calls
Sο if уου, know lіkе I know being home ain't a chore
Sο I'm ma sit οn my couch, chill watching ѕοmе porn
Cause when the rents gone dog I bе οn ѕοmе Ferris
Bueller I be fueling up the car at mу parents
Bυt wait a second, mу folks don’t hаνе a Solarus
Oops, mу bad, seems thіѕ іѕ thе wrong address

[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]
I’m іn thе basement cold chillin' (chllin')
Dіd I take thе garbage out, I sure didn’t
I’m straight tripping, grades slipping I’m οn punishment
Cаn’t even slide tο that house party where аll thе honeys wеnt (damn)
Cartoon Network, MTV, BET, MTV jams, vh1, History, A&E
Working fοr whoever paying mе except thе police
Stay up аll night kicking raps аnd smoking don’t gеt nο sleep
And еνеr ѕіnсе I brοkе thаt table іn thе kitchen
Thеу bеen taking mу allowance аѕ thе payment fοr thе fixin'
Cυt thе grass, clean mу room аnd аll thаt bull
Kicking nеw raps in thе lunchroom whеn I gеt tο school
Mу nigga dope took mе tο Sydney Bloke tο gеt thе gear
Throw backs and J's ain’t thаt whу wе here
I’m 13 again hopped up іn thе hot tub time machine
Cаn’t walk without no freestyles egging οn Holloween[Verse One: Mike Posner]
Yes I know it's been too long
Probably seems I'm always gone
Still don't know where I belong

Heaven just a plane away
I know my mom, she can't wait
When I feel I've lost my way
I go home, home, home

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Back home
Back home
Back home
Home
Back home

[Verse Two: Mike Posner]
It doesn't feel too much changed
I still get called my government name
Everything still feels the same
Back home, home, home

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mike Posner talking]
Aye. Ladies and gentlemen we have a very special guest with us today. He goes by the name of King Chip

[Verse Three: King Chip]
Either Hopkins or Burke Lakefront
When I touch down we gon' blaze up
We gon' sleep late when we wake up
We gon' crash tomorrow to get away from
Them bad vibes that you call me 'bout
And all them problems you was talkin' 'bout
Man, I really wish Hawk was 'round
And I ain't seen my dawgs in way too long
I can never get use to being away from home
Let me get a haircut, got to pull to roots
Thornhill Drive, yeah these my roots
I remember hittin' Tower City on that Rapid
Now I got a store in Tower City, how that happen?
Never thought Cleveland would be a place I'd visit
But when you from the Midwest man ain't nothin' given

[Hook][Verse 1]
She was on World Star butt naked
Had to be 18 or older just to check it
She got baby oil on in her bedroom
Bunch of dirty laundry all across her bed dude
The head rude, super dome
She backstage but she ain't no groupie homes
Now you know that's a lie, she ready for whatever
She'll fuck you good and if you pay her, she'll fuck you better
I'm a dog, bitch - can you take a bone
She on Model Mayhem with too much makeup on
Her and a girl, 2 going at once, plural
We in the hotel and I'm making it rain euros
She stop giving me head and said "What's these?"
I said "My bad, bitch. I just came back from overseas."
And while she out here tryna fuck for a buck
I got this other bitch tryna fuck for a truck

[Hook] x2
Shawty wanna be a model
She on the internet going full throttle
Shawty wanna be a model
She on the internet going full throttle

[Verse 2]
Bad bitch from Brazil, spoke Portuguese
She might even let you crack her if you worth some cheese
Out in Ibiza, we smoking trees
Ain't paying for that ho pussy, paying that ho to leave
Don't get me misunderstood, yes the pimping is good
Got a bitch in the 'burbs, got a bitch in the hood
Legs up, hit it from the front door
Gave her a encore and she still want more
This bitch talking 'bout take her out to eat on me
My Cali bitches got that EBT, they eat for free
Ain't nothing better than good food and crazy dome
She said fuck that R&B, go throw that Jay-Z on
Long as her hair together, long as her purse is Lou
Nighttime stripper, daytime nursing school
She put her favorite song on and ripped them clothes off
Told her girl to film on the iPhone while she goes off

[Hook] x2[Verse 1]
Yeah, my nigga's own father shot him in
The stomach like four times
He took a step back, look his pop
In the eyes and he survived
Nigga that shit so crazy
Dog on life I hit survive
Nigga that shit so crazy
Nigga on life I swear for God
What could make a nigga try to murk his own son?
I know I'd die for mine
Your parent got a divorce
Nigga shot your bitch ass and quit crying
My nigga be strong, nigga hold your own
Nigga this world ain't no ho
So many people I really love, they ain't alive no more
My day my niggas don't fuck with me no more
Because they broke
Like 21 years right down the drain my hearts are called no joke
Nigga that shit so crazy
Nigga on life I swear for God
My nigga got shot on that front lawn
That's where he died

[Hook 1]
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back
Bitch, bitch ass world
Bitch ass world tryna hold me back

[Verse 2]
Nigga in this wise they gettin' dick come take a flick
With a nigga who'd get all his shit and call him Chip
Up the text soon as they call the shit they call it quits
Shot the band and shot the audience I'll applaud him bitch
Clapping at him, I don't care if it's not fair
I don't care if they pussy don't even got hair
Till my gunners don't let him live
Till my gunners go up to the suburb where they mama live and pop the crib
Bitch I'm from the 44108 murder zone
Be Cali getting crown like I never heard of dome
I am king look what I came I own my own name
I ain't trade it for fame I am the same

[Hook 2]
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X
Walkin though the crib with a chopper
Walkin though the crib
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X
Walkin though the crib with a chopper
Walkin though the crib
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X
Walkin though the crib with a chopper
Walkin though the crib
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X
Walkin though the crib with a chopper like Malcolm X

[Verse 2]
Got that MAC nasty and the [?]
Ready to shoot it out with the hook if they raid the crib
So if I open all you this ain't no laser tag
The fuck is you gonna do if that gonna make me mad
You can buy school but can't pay for class
I say bullshit long as you're paying cash
You too can get an 8mm
.22 and my tempo's playing
Pencil brakes with .38's graduated to a Ber'
Staring through the drapes peaking though the blinds
With this AK-47 4-5
TEC-9 and the .40 that'll blow your mind

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah blood thicker than water, but money thicker than blood
But that's the one I spent on rodeo you can get dub
I'm in the coupe with something cute gettin' this loot
Racks in my pants, racks in my hands, racks in my boots
Got your advance except I don't owe it back like you
All of this mine watch me go ham I could buy you
True, my entertainment sell appliances
If King Chip ain't on your stereo, then why you buy the shit
Hit the club with a hundred killas like an Afghan
Hit the club in all black looking like Batman
King Chip is too heinous you ignoramus
Can nappytab my name on your face
Know what my name is

[Hook 2][Intro: Chip tha Ripper]
Boom
We livin' in the last days
Yeah we saw what's over

[Hook: Chip tha Ripper]
40 on me break you off proper
Ain't even gotta cock it just boomshakalaka
Yeah I'm a young cold motherfucker
Pull the hammer out and rock ya like boomshakalaka
My niggas hit licks like Shottas
Load up the forty glockas like Boomshakalaka boom
And my bitch gone blast
And she got that ass like boomshakalaka nigga
People say we runnin out of time
And they gonna drop another bomb like boomshakalaka
I'm a lose my fucking mind
And I'mma blast this tech nine like boomshakalaka bitch
People say we runnin out of time
And they gonna drop another bomb like boomshakalaka
A nigga run upon me and try to take mine
I'm a pop this tech nine like boomshakalaka bitch

[Verse 1: Chip tha Ripper]
I'm ballin forty in my hand
Bet this motherfucker won't NBA Jam
Up the Springfield, don't think my aim off
My Louie Jacket cost more then ya chain cost
I'm finna act up, not sober (drunk as fuck)
I'm strapped up, glaucoma (fuck you up)
Hot damn, son of a bitch
Tell your daddy hush don't be a son of a snitch
Turn the t.v. on, they tellin' stories
Turn your bitches on, she extra horny
You know what I'm on, with your fine ass
She got red lipstick on the wine glass
I know you niggas mad, I see you tail wagging
Act like you got some sense or something bad will happen
She got off work and came straight to the club
Your bitch tryna catch a date with some rich thugs
And you mad

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Trill OG Bun B all ready
Trigger finger on the trigger and it's all steady
No problem is too big or too small
Got the third eye to see around corners and through walls
No matter who calls we answer first ring
Mind on the money baby that's the first thing
Got your baby mama, by her purse strings
Losing her to me wouldn't be the worst thing
This that mob music, strictly for made men
Run up like you want it you can catch up fade then
I ain't playin I'll pop you and then I'm not stayin
They gone find you right there in the same spot you lay in
I'm not the one and I'm not the two bro
I'm the cat who gone make it do what it do bro
And you know so act right
Cause I'm gonna keep the mack tight make it go boomshakalaka

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chip tha Ripper]
I'm what you call a living legend (sha-plow)
This what you call a mack eleven (sha-plow)
Here's two on the way down (plow plow)
Here's four more (plow plow plow plow)
I got a plan to take over your land
If you keep it one hundred I keep it hundred grand
I'm not a star you know my name now my story
You simple you represent fame I rep glory
Damn now these nigga's talking down
But they don't say nothin' when I'm around
We don't fuck with y'all no dap you get a pound
Naw, matter of fact fuck that you get a round
I don't' hang with industry niggas I hang with killers
I don't fuck with these rap niggas they ain't my niggas
My whole outfit from Paris
Show up to your house party like Robin Harris with the

[Hook][Hook: The O'My's]
Living the dream ain't all it seems
Some turn fiends for the paperback greens
Truth be told, it's all I know
I'd rather go blind than lose my soul
Rather not eat if it means I can't speak
I don't lose sleep over niggas who's sweet
See this whole dream was built on cream
If it ain't about a dollar why you talking to me?

[Verse One: Chuck Inglish]
See oil's still spillin', niggas still chillin' tho
We in your house like the rock through the window
Yeah ho, and it's like that for you
And you thought that I wasn't going to mention this at all
It's about to blow and everybody's on dope
Like who hasn't died from a fuckin' overdose
Well here's a song, get on, methadone
Take the edge off, slid off, how you love that
This is how we do it, we writin' them real raps
I ain't got to worry about gettin' my chain back
Cuz niggas know I don't need to get mine snatched
And I hope when they hear this they can feel where I'm at
Like back in the day buying tapes before sacks
Macks catch a case in the face, Max pen
And it happened to some friends
They intentions were waybetter than their decisions
I'm not finished
Call every number on my phone like 'you heard that new song, that came on
It was wild, that nigga Chuck lost his mind on that line'
And it rhymed like...

[Hook: The O'My's]

[Verse Two: Chip Tha Ripper]
Twenty-Twelve is here, we all is avatars
We all be livin' large, we all got pretty broads
The whole globe is ours, we taking over the earth
You thought it was bad now, this shit is going to get worse
Cuz niggas with money too flashy, unruly
Brain washed by this life, it's like a movie
Stay the realist to the end, call me young Abbie Hoffman
Hear about em all the time, we don't see em often
And he don't fit in with all them cornballs
It's going down to late to warn ya'll
This is how real niggas get down, too laid back
Cause attention is for girls, that's why she's wearing that

[Hook: The O'My's]

[Verse Three: Chance The Rapper]
Little rapper, wrap up all that trap rap bullshit
You can dancer, back up (IGH)
Damn dear prancers, don't dash for dames
Don't dip for chips, don't give up your chain
Let me flash the bang, wait and see if they buck
Let me see if they miss, if they hit me it's luck
If they touch me I quit, I'm a rapper's delight
I'm the rapper to like, a comma after the the
Got a bad appetite (IGH)
Fake food that's that shit I dislike (IGH)
Fake boobs that's that shit I did like (IGH)
She likes the mixed drinks
I like the mixed type
She got an accent
She loved the mixtape
Oh you're english?
You heard of Chuck The Rapper?
You heard of Chance The Ripper?
You wanna fuck a rapper?
Life's funny like that, like that
Make it then you bring it right back, right back

[Hook: The O'My's] (x2)

[Verse Four: Twista]
The things that people are willing to do when they want to go straight to the top
Integrity's always important regardless if you ever make it or not
I seen enough of the suffering, what will we do and amounting to nothing and
No method for kissing and hugging the babies, they hatin' instead of lovin' them
And what's up with the government, it never get better
We forever fight over cheddar, so what does it matter who running it - democrat or republican
Stay on top of your business, let nobody stop you from living the dream
Try to be careful about what you do because nothing is as good as it seems
Out of the dark, steppin up hard into the light
Whatever's wrong you can do right, Going against everybody in spite
Lovin' the thoughts they might be having about you not bein' able to come with it on em
...until you shitted on em
Enemies finna face defeat, so they finna hate me
Came through in the place to be in a Benz, Mercedes
They way I spit I'm laced with heat so they imitate me
Flow over interracial beats - Blended Babies
