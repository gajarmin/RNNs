[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Heyyo Mr. Chance The Rapper, I greatly appreciate the way you roll out the red carpet, allowing me to articulate myself, and now I stand on my own two below me. Yeah!

[Hook: The Social Experiment & Maceo of The O'My’s]
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I’m a man understanding the plan and I'm on
To be greater than anything make you a fan in this song
How I stand out and wonderin’ what planet I’m gone
The one and only God of kings come from
A hundred grand on, a child I always ran from the wrong
Standing on his own two but wanna stand with the strong
Please get to turning on the fan cause it’s warm
While I build just a little 'bout the man I was born to be
This whole planet belongs to me
We all feel the same so it belongs to we
We talkin’ all night but this is my birth right
Please can you get to bringin’ the crown to me?
Yea I know you all for it
You’ll only be deemed worthy if you stand tall for it
When you and your men were sitting, yeah, I know you all saw it!
This great ship we got goin’ on
Don’t slip

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I was born on my own two feet watching Bruce Lee
‘Fore I grew teeth I had a pen and some loose leaf
Pots and pans when the roof leak
‘Fore I ever smoked mids ‘fore I ever blew trees
Used to drive a hoopdie that broke down on me usually
Nas was lookin’ at me, pockets was lookin’ through me
Never planned on college I dropped out as a student
My GPA started with a decimal like Dewy
That’s lower than low, that’s lower than most
But if you thought I wouldn’t make it, you slower than slow
I make the type of music that stoners should know
If I plant one of my thoughts marijuana would grow
And I be high enough to go where I wanted to go (Reefer)
Might be covered in glitter but all of it’s gold
A nigga got that loud and it's all for the low
And everybody sayin’ “aww, let’s go”

[Hook]

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
It ain’t so easy
It’s not too hard
It ain’t so easy
But it’s not so hard
To stand up
Stand up
But it’s just too easy
To sit back down[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today

[Break: Raury]
Careful
Careful
Careful

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper, Raury, & BJ the Chicago Kid]
No no no no no no no no no no
Careful
Careful
Don't trust a word I say
Careful (Careful)
Careful
Don't trust a word I say
Careful
If you learn one thing today (Yeah, yeah, yeahhhh)
Careful (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Careful (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Be careful (Careful)

[Outro: Chance the Rapper, Raury, BJ the Chicago Kid, Eryn Allen Kane, & Jamila Woods]
Careful
(Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say)
Careful
(Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today)
Careful
(Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say)
Careful
(If you learn one thing today)
Careful
(Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say)
Careful
(If you learn one thing today)
Careful (Careful)

You can never be too careful, trust no word I say
Don't trust a- don't trust a word I say
Don't you don't you don't you
Don't be so careful
Don't trust a word I say[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Best friends and lovers
Can't seem to draw the line between each other
What is defined means nothing to a brother
You just don't give a damn, that's why I think I love ya
It's not fair, how easy I melt when you play with my hair
I ain't going nowhere, it's not right
I can't sleep without you anymore at night time
Not in this lifetime

[Hook 1: Kehlani]
Love ain't never been so close, but so far away
Like your mind is telling you to just back off
And your heart says just stay
What's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
If it's not too late, yeah you realise it one day
We can go to the movies boy, maybe we could hang out boy
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Verse 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
One day we're lovers, next day we're friends
Don't know where it begins or it ends
But let me tell you one thing going through a nigga's head
Most nigga's just scared
It feels too good to be true
Every time I'm with you
I'm ignoring what I'm next to

[Hook 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Cause love ain't never been so close, but so far away
It's like my mind is telling me to just back off
And my heart says just stay
Tell me what's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
And if it's not too late, maybe I realize it one day
We can go to the movies girl, maybe we could hang out girl
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Break: Kehlani & (BJ the Chicago Kid)]
(I'm down for you baby)
Babe I'm down for you
(Are you down for me)
I'm down for you
I'm down for you

[Hook 1: Kehlani & BJ the Chicago Kid]

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
And when I'm ready baby
Maybe it won't be too late
Maybe one day you find some guy
That won't treat you like I will
Better choose up, better hurry up
Time keeps ticking, but you're my lover[Produced by Swiff D]

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
See I've been in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
All night layin' verses though I'd rather lay with you, baby
Bra and panties matchin', nail and toes, you all kinda lady
Angel out of Heaven, such a goddess have a nigga prayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
You need a real nigga, shorty
So come and throw that pussy, shorty
See I think you and me can make it
This little verse to get you naked
See, your heart ain't meant for breaking
Cupid's never been mistaken
See, I been caught up in the moment
Shit, my type ain't quite her type but now this gangsta nigga on it
She can twist my weed and hit the 'yac
I can hit your type without the hat, put that pussy on the map
I see qualities in a bad girl, I know that ass you got
Come with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl
Cause you girl, cause you girl, girl, cause you girl, girl
Cause you girl, girl...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Throw a loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded
Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playing?
Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation
Like, na-na-na, la-la, la-la, you get what I'm saying
No metaphors, nothing like that
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you
So, I'mma put this dick up all in-side-of-you

[Trombone by J.P. Floyd]

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Even better than I was the last time baby
Oh oh oh oh ooh
Yo we back
I'm good, so good
And we back and we back

[Verse 1]
Rap's just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'mma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance,hundreds zan, gallon lean
Make a joke bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some "x" on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancellor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"
Magical word (poof), please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done
I'm good! IGH!

[Hook][Produced by DJ Ozone]

[Intro: Slum Village]
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick (On the mic like it's a dick)
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit (The shit)
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
What's good, good? And what's good, evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And whys God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills, down I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya Kna Wha Mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young cause it just not cool

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
Cause they help me beat my demons ass

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
(3x)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Saba]
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against we tryna get lucky
Doper than Lucky
You're ending happy that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless IGH

[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
One time, what's the word
What's the word, what's the word
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo
Turn me up on the headphones
Two times, twist the herb
Twist the herb, twist the herb
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weapon
I drop bombs on an enemy at any second
Look at me wrong I turn you to tomb stones
Lock you in the crosshairs and you gone, then I throw my deuce up
Sip sangritas with your señorita, like me gusta
See what that early morning cock will do up to your rooster
I bet my cockiness will boost her confidence
Then  you gon' wonder where your highness went

[Refrain 1: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I bet she get low for a nigga like me
She get low for a nigga like me
I bet she get low for a nigga like me
Low for a nigga like me

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
So we burn the mary jane til' the third degree
Some niggas bitin' flows yo, that's burglary
Same niggas actin' like they never heard of me
A fuck nigga could get clocked, yo that's word to me

[Refrain 2: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
He get blown for a nigga like me
Get his head exposed for a nigga like me
Put him on the floor for a nigga like me

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
My mind boggles when time toggles
In the ocean of stars it's hard to find goggles, we twisted up
So we put it in the air
Don't let the j's start unravelling
We gettin' blown like a javelin
She throw it back like she time travelin'
Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddling
I'm screaming "Land, ho!" 'bout to hit for sure
I motorboat it slow then I ripped the flow
I'm pretty sure-like nice beaches-that
Even at my weakest I still leave 'em speechless
How you like those peaches?
Find me rotting the apple
'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grapple
Feeling like the highest man about to tackle
Facts like the tat under the cap of the Snapple
Cats get decapitated for actin' a fool
Blacks get their ass sprayed just for makin' a move

[Refrain 3: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
We get high and say "fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "fuck the police"

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Cause every time I make a move they be sweatin' me
They want another black man in penitentiary
It's even hard for that man standing next to me
Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me
It's like every step bring me close to destiny
And every breath I get closer to the death of me
I'm just tryna carry out my own legacy
But the place I call home ain't lettin' me

[Refrain 4: Joey Bada$$]
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG

[Verse 5: Joey Bada$$]
Cause every corner I turn a nigga testing me
And every morning I mourn just for the less of me
Sometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me
And not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace

[Refrain 5: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me

[Verse 6: Joey Bada$$]
I'm something like the chairman of the board, rantin'
I feel invincible like McMannon
One of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet
Strike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damnit
Cats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded
By the lyrical New York City bandit
True Warrior like Rembrandt
Yo some cats claim they fly but really been landed
I really can't stand it
Let me take a seat, this where Rosa Parks her bum, now
Make some room for me
PE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep
My old hoes call me now, leave a message after the beep
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I just wanna beat, girl, I just wanna beat
I just wanna be free

[Refrain 5][Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I remember back in the beginning
I was scared to give you my love
I didn’t wanna let go of all these women
Then I believed and began to trust
And messing around was very tempting
Cus even the bad ones buss
And girl I never thought you’d be the one
To leave me

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I had to let it breathe for a while cus
Cus girl when you left me I was broken down
Yea I was broken down for a while but
But that’s when I woke up and said

[Pre-Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
The first 5 minutes
I put you all in it
Then something went wrong and you ran
Over the next 5 minutes
You left for 5 minutes

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] (Add-2)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Heard the guy you left me for wasn’t even faithful
But you went to him anyway
Heard every time you left from seeing him yea
But he had another one on the way
Girl just to think I still love you
Yea, a nigga have to be crazy
And girl I never thought you’d be the one
To leave me

[Bridge]

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Add-2]
Hold up
Yo! Clock’s tickin'
I fell for someone who couldn’t stop trippin'
Listen up, if yo' heart broke you better glue the pieces
I put my ex down like there’s treasure underneath 'er
Love me in the limelight but the spotlight fades
Back of the jersey all you wanted was a name and
Guess I was to blame even thinkin' you would change
Like Spike, like Jack, I watched you play games every day
What’s the point of a partner you can’t depend on?
Drowning in emotions, that ain’t a surface to swim on
You never gon' get it like En Vogue in the friend zone
Seen it comin' quicker like a psychic who a nympho
But I’m cool on my bullshit
Like a matador with new shoes avoid the bullshit
Said I was the one like Neo and I’m guessin' you was right
When you left felt I dodged a bullet
15 minutes, 15 minutes
15 minutes, baby girl you’re gone
Know I used to love 'er, word to Common, I ain't never hatin'
I’m turnin' tables like I’m doin some redecoratin'
Fall in love, bring a parachute
Girl, love is blind, now I wonder what I seen in you
Girlfriends turnin', you want blowin up and now you like wow
Your 15 minutes end -- now

[Hook][Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Girl let me lay you down baby and give you what you need (in my bedroom)
I'm rough when necessary but I'm guaranteed to please
You took your panties off in the car
So baby girl scratch that we ain't gotta do that

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
And when we start to kissing we'll both be listening to the sounds of our hearts
Girl we can do it all night
And when we start to touching we'll both be loving every moment of tonight
All this can happen babe if you just say aiight
Baby just say aiight

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Girl now that I'm inside baby I just can't keep my cool, no (in my bedroom)
Now tell me ain't that some shit now
I'm loving what I'm feeling but it's so much we can do, baby
You took your panties off in the car (Baby-ay-ay-ay-ay)

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
And when we start to kissing we'll both be listening to the sounds of our hearts
Cause we can do it all night
And when we start to touching we'll both be loving every moment of tonight
All this is happening babe cause you said aiight
Lil mama you said aiight

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
A..I..I-G-H-T.....
I-I-I-G-H-T.....[Produced by Tommy Black]

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I know exactly how it is to feel like no one cares
About the hard work you put in but who said life was fair?
It sure wasn't me I take the bitter with the sweet
And boil it in the pot make a hot toddy
I said If I'm going to play I'm going to play for keeps
Raise stakes, take stage, speak my peace
Make my pay, take my lady on a date
Send my parents on a cruise
Living, somewhere with a killer view, oh the irony I spew
But for now the studio couches gonna have to do
I ain't going to take what I ain't earned myself, foolish pride
That's what you need to survive, it's do or die
So step aside I don't mean no trouble
Just want to be someone that CJ could look up to
Oh, and just so you know
When I'm on the road I'm at the Travelodge not The W

[Hook]
Almost there, almost there, almost there
The finish line is in sight but I'm almost there, almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there, almost there
Even if the sun don't shine the sun don't shine, almost

[Verse 2]
Somebody asked me, what you mean by longterm mentality, actually?
So I had to break it down:
Don't get caught up in the now, focus on the years abroad
Cause today you're here but tommorow you could be gone
Singing the same old song
And who's the place to blame on? Other than you
Whatever it is you do
From slanging eight balls to graduating from school
Just gotta see it all before it happens
I ain't saying see a psychic
I'm just saying have a, idea of what you're accomplishing
You'll have a greater chance to accomplish it
You know a little strategy, premeditation
Wins races nine times out of ten
As if losing's ever an option
Had to bust my own bubble I really thought I was popping (Not quite)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just know your future's right around the corner
Oppurtunity galore for ya
More and more you'll start to see it's no limit to what you can be
In any event, eventually
Treat your first like your last time
Cause it might be your last time, that's what I learned last time
Look forward to looking forward in my pastime
You just letting time pass like "that's fine" as wine
Contrary to popular belief, I want the peace
They say I'm headed hellbound at God's speed
Gesundheit, or bless me if you like
As I, put my faith in this bud and budlight
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Talk my shit, drop my load on
Hold on, I don't think you know how close I am
By the time this song's done I'm already there[Verse - Thurzday]
Ho is not short for honey,
Homie, holy, hobby
Inner woods of holly, [sh...]
Molly popping by golly
While prayers go out to whoever fathers her child
A smile is probably what gotcha
Catching that old sea bass, garlic butter on lobster
[With bling on,?] she watched ya', act liked she foreign
But from the [??] with a rapport for [touring?]
Off a nigga cash [int?] [tent?] be obscurrin'
[Flirt?] with your [chaps,?] she in search of Ralph Lauren
[?] pull your cash low and cook campaign pouring
She drunk off Rose thinking no dick the morning
All [?] spade with the ace big bust
Small waist look good, and do better with a face
To use what she got to put your balls in her palm
When she leaves she puts her ring back on

[Hook - Bj the Chicago Kid]
Yeah, when the clock stops, you're just another number
Then it's the next stop, never see her again
Again until the beat drops
Her friends think shes a star now
But fellas know she's a [?]
But you're just another number

[Verse 2 - Thurzday]
These hoes will stick you up
Pussy gonna chased mouse
Ransacking your house, swiping your account
Multiple amounts, that all brought doubt
But made you forget because that magic in her mouth
That you thought was free, when she put ten on three
Ran that game like she got her own money
And don't leave no nigga [?]?] sunny
Daddy [and?] shoes gave her the psyche of a junkie
Addicted to the pipes of athletes, and more...
Them panties an open door, accustom to all fours
They say love is the duty of the soul
So is it beautiful to only love whatever grows on trees
(What separates the women from the hoes)
[?] is never good, until your eyes' seen worse
So I hope you stay clean from the dirt
And keep them jazzy bells off the collar of your [?] shirt

[Hook:][Verse 1: Punch]
Yeah, uh, let’s go deep inside the mind of a project veteran
Raised with nothing on the block with his brethren
A fifth of hennessy, swisher filled up with medicine
Devilish grin, inhale deep, let the devil in
Compelling stories between him and his men
Feel like a rap cypher except way more liver
With intimate details, shades of a grey writer
Hit a plight of a ghetto survivor
Deuce five in his waist, impatiently waiting
Trying to get richer, priors hanging over his head
Serving as reminders
Ain’t nothing funny, his stomach turn
And his eyes burn, soul on ice
So far from Christ, he had to fight
Any disagreement, he take flight
No thinking twice, anything further and the slug’s ‘gon fly
Project mind, the choice, his life or mine
That’s a very thin line, tell momma I tried
Hood got ‘em sprinkling lines, Mary don’t get ‘em high
Something to justify the stress in his lifetime
Like why his lil mama cute face, nice thighs
Strip on the side and set niggas up for a time
Project bread, baby was three when her daddy died
Shot seventeen times and he almost survived
That’s where she hang her whole pride
That’s really where she tried to hide
All the pain deep inside, the project mind

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Started off flipping on a mattress, pissy
Slapboxin’ won’t sock him until he hit me
Streetlights come on, runnin’ through them hallways
Dope spots open, sherm heads all day
Crackheads speaking with they teeth missing
Pushin’ shopping carts with cans in them
Dope dealers keep pitching, and while she keep bitching
She at the county building, they cut off her GR
How she gonna feed the children?
He got a chip on his shoulder, keep a pistol let his clip show
Rob the dice game because he piss poor, all the homies know it’s him
Desperate time equals desperate measures
Walk away all you see is stretchers
Niggas in the kitchen with the yay tryna stretch it
So we can buy Benzs and bag bad bitches
Cause growing up niggas never had riches
Niggas will die trying to get that cash, kill ‘em

[Verse 3: Punch]
The project mind is hustle by design
Too many spots in the hood set up across state lines
Extend the brand, franchise expansion
Guerrilla marketing plan, ensure the hood’s advancement
Groomed in criminology, equivalent to a Ph.D
Doctorates degree at any Ivy League college
Skull and Bone fraternity, oh forsaken
We promise to gang ban eternally
Death before dishonor

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Nigga respect for your honor, they fuck niggas, no condoms
My nigga got life for powder, pop shots it’s problems
Fuck your sign, nigga we rivals
Broke niggas is plotting cut-throat conniving
Smoke niggas for iron, prey on the weak
Predators lurking, you better not sleep nigga
All red bandanas, we deep nigga
Gorillas and the miss bananas be the clips
Concrete jungle come and take a trip, the wildlife
Wild days and wild nights
National Geographic images capture hazardous
High definition camera shit, if you flash better blast it quick
Or be labeled a bitch, niggas is gone, project shit
Better watch who you with the paperwork said he snitch
Plug tiles on that relationship

[Verse 5: Punch]
You could tell a project nigga by the scars on his neck and face
Clothesline caught him running from Jake
Runaway slave confined to a hundred and eighth
Central Compton Avenue to Imperial
My pops told me that the saga continues from
Milk and cereal to candle light visuals
Gangsters turn spiritual prayers never make it past the ceiling
Sherm sticks numbs the feelings of the killings, that’s the ritual
Visiting room at capacity, little homie in critical
He never got a visual on who shot him
Him and his men, same niggas
Who did is sitting, plotting they revenge in the hospital
Knowing it was him he proceeds to squeeze on the rifle
Says “spark the beef” rifle techs, hollow tips, vest
Concrete jungle tribal wars, survival of the 'jects
Ignorance is vexed, welcome to my consciousness

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Well, it’s the project mind
Well, it’s the project mind
Well, it’s the project mind
State of emergency

[Outro]
This was no-no place for me not to go
So guess this is the same mentality the Bloods and Crips have
As far as not being able to go on certain avenues because one is red and one is blue
So if they saw you up in here, you know you would stab me
This was one of the projects, that was the strongest out of all the projects
And it was called this right here, The Nickerson Gardens
This was a first for me
And actually if I had took my fear away
Could come...could come into the famous Nickerson Gardens
Now I still won’t come up here at night…[Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
Ice cream, ice white ones, we the dream team
High top Timbs, tuck it in, go with anything
Anything? Yeah, that Northface, bet
That army green tech shell jacket that reflects
Carhartts saggin', I forgot my belt
Karl Kani sweats one pants leg up
When I lay eyes on her, gave the whole game up
We shoulda danced one time, curveball, changeup
Check it
Friday in a whip, playin' shawtay off late[?]
With my shorty mixtapes for the party
Something old from the crates, ice cold milkshakes
Couple girls had curls, couple girls had braids
(Know what I'm sayin?)
It's like the whole shebang
Better than gripping money when I hold your hand
That's the whole word, keep a dope verse like this
Lil' jewels you could drop off in your purse real quick
Girlfriend, take a first class flight around the world twice
Bet you won't find another love like this
We'll never be poor, but we might get rich
And I ain't worried bout that cause I'm makin' these hits
Make love not paper, but we save ours up
So we could take a vacation, baby roll one up
Cop that Benz G-Wag truck, the one that you love
New paint job, cover it what color you want

[Hook 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Girl, I ain't gon' trick cause you ain't going nowhere
Said the shit so good, girl I ain't making it fair
You'll be going nowhere fast, cause can't nobody do you like I do
And when they see me, they see you
Cause baby you are
Yeah girl you are
My shining star
Or near or far
My shining star

[Verse 2: Chuck Inglish]
Get it girl, get it girl, get it girl, huh
Old habits die fast in my world
Eyes open, fly over, be my girl
Arms open looking for it like a pearl
Ice cream, waffle cones, with the swirl
Curls in your hair, fingernails get the twirl
Hands in the air, air, sure
At the party, play the jam, let's see you work
Say word, lookin' real live like "that's my girl"
Airbrush the sweats, together, forever, pinky promise, bet
Same time, a simple homage, you can take your pick
But watch movies on the couch, I know you love that shit

[Hook 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
And if they ever looking for me
They can always find me, cause I'm with you
Yeah girl you are
My shining star
Or near or far
My shining star
Yeah girl you are
My shining star
Or near or far
My shining star

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Don't matter if the time's right
Matter fact, the time's right
I ain't too busy caught up in the night life
Baby, you my limelight
And you shine bright
Baby you, you always send me sky-high
I never knew I could fly
Got my eyes looking high
That's why I'm never saying bye
Cause baby you are

[Hook 3 (2x): BJ The Chicago Kid]
Yeah girl you are
My shining star
Or near or far
My shining star

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Yeah, they can always find me cause I'm with you
Chilling with you
Eating with you
Loving on you[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
You fine as hell, you know you are
You shine just like a shining star
On a nighttime, on a daytime
In the city you go to, they say you fine
You know you are, you cold as ice
If you broke my heart, you only got twice
Cause just like you i'm a cold nigga
I only fuck with centerfolds nigga

[Bridge: BJ the Chicago Kid & Freddie Gibbs]
You know you are
You know you are (x3)

When you see me pull up in a rover
Then you know it's time for you to bend over

This for my bad bitch, bad bitch
Super bad, perfect ass, got you on baby get your cash
Bad bitch, my bad bitch
Super bad, perfect ass, got you on baby get your cash

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Girl I ain't tripping if you give it on the first night
Cause really I was down to fucking you at first sight
I see your head, nails, shoes and your purse, right
So get upon this dick and ride it like a dirtbike
Frontseat, the backseat we zoom-zoom
Hit it while we [?] and vroom-vroom
Twisting up a doobie, inhale the kush fumes
Head game stupid, ya pussy a damn fool
So I ran upon  that ass another day
I got a condo out in Cali you can go and stay
I was leaving other bitches like a throw-away
I'm try'na keep you on my team, let you know the play
Baby you fine as hell (You know you are)
That's cold in them draws, when they closed her up
My homie told me that I shouldn't let it go too far
The last nigga that you was with, you probably broke his heart, cause you

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro: x7]
(Cause that nigga ain't me)That nigga ain't me[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
So I just twist up a sweet
Brain tissue stay gettin burned
As I cruise up 94, did a robbery night before
He thought I was there to purchase 10, but I robbed him for 90 more
Now I'm 100 solid, bout to set up shop in Wisconsin
Grabbed my phone and chirped my plug in Milwaukee, he just responded
Homie told me sex, money and drugs, they rule the earth
So get your own, you know them thangs good as gone when they touch the turf
Destined to pay for my dirt, the resist of temptation was hard
So be a thug from your birth til you face to face with your god
And when I'm faced with that moment, I check out chiefin on straight kill
Baptized in a lake of fire, so this how hell feel
And I ain't never snitched or took the stand, bitch I'm a gangsta

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
Heard his family wept, with my weaponery blew the wall off
Know some Belizian boys that'll bury you with your balls off
Castrated
Niggas in yo click cut yo throat just cuz you candy painted
Made a little change and they forgot that you barely made it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket of crabs
I couldn't put food in my budget, I was bustin my ass
To make a choice to either eat or have money for gas
Enough to make you break morals for the love of this cash
The devil work and he stay immersed in my idle time
When there ain't shit twerkin, niggas get murked in this life of mine
And I took some hits on some niggas, never knew what they did
Never considered they momma, they family or they kid
Loaded up my sig, got a pint of gin and I took a swig
Bout to go knock his ass off the map cuz I'm on my dick

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
I'm a made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Heard he utter words of my murder, but it was all talk
The killers I know don't get caught, but I bet they all walk
I'm a made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
This thuggin gon' be the death of me, lord we all lost

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me what would you do?
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
Tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?[Part 1: Can't Hold My Liquor]

[Hook: Justin Vernon] (x2)
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Verse: BJ The Chicago Kid]
3 cups of hen and I'm on one
Came with one bitch but want all of 'em
Let's ball or somthin'
(Shit, what they lip read?)
My dick and balls or somethin'
(America was built off lies, sex, and money)
And 12K years later, that's the same exact shit here for me
(Aww this thick broad right here I'm tryna)
Break, break down
Cause this liquor breaking me on down

[Part 2: It's True]

[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
First Imma start with my nigga Al Mac
The first real nigga I lost
Even though he used to gang bang
Would never live to see his chain swing
But that's the Jesus piece loss
Cause he would have rocked it well
But instead he rocked that hair full of braids
Braided by his girl Leecy
Went to Simeon, nigga had game kinda cold
Never killed a soul
So we never had a problem with thinking this ever getting known
Living life like it never would happen
Shit, niggas dying like life really going full circle
Thought we was gonna live to see it all
Till that day that he died on a head-on collision with a motorcycle

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I met Jamico when I went to high-school
They stayed around the corner but shit, I never knew
Me and Kisel Ken in the basement playing drums, making music
While she fussy yelling down the stairs
"I'm on the phone you losers!"
I remember late for school every morning thirsty for that mickey d's
Not knowin the death of a mother matured him very quickly
So we go fast forward school graduated
Went to college got married
They had a pretty little girl but the world couldn't make her tardy
He died from a seizure at her daughter's birthday party

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Blue chucks, swing Glocks, they're both in my pants
I'm a gangster I can do no wrong
Fuck with the lights on tell you I love you baby
Cuz tomorrow may not make it to me
I got a kilo and a seven series when a crown went crack nigga
I bet the gun sale plat, oh
ATF be on that sucker shit
They hate a black nigga with getting money's involved
Got an ounce in my draws
I just wanna live forever my nigga
Took the blue pill, crack the Act seal
If Q said it then you know that shit's real
Pistol grip pump on my lap all times
I used to drive a Hyundai with the dimes inside
Now drive by is by the lost that kill bay base kids
So the gun is who my role model is, the illest crip in the biz
Look, I'm never half of my steppin', I never not with my weapon
So you'll get got in a second like

[Hook]

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Alright man, just for a few seconds
If you got somebody that you lost it was vital to your life
And you feel like you really got a guardian angel right now
I mean, yes I say man, you mean, [?] at the same time, yeah
Get ready

Brady, where are you?
Brady, where are you?
It's grand-ma, where's Amy
Alright, she's probably with her momma right?

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
They ain't have women like you when my momma was young
They ain't have niggas like me when my daddy was young
See it's a crazy generation, a sticky situation
We don't want love, everybody want relations
They ain't have women like you when my momma was young
They ain't have nigga's like me when my daddy was young
See it's a crazy generation

[Verse 1:]
She do it for the Vine, but damn man I be loving it
She from a share culture, where the share holders, make profit off, then budget with
We smiling so branded get violent, then gram it
Is she fucking, thats the only thing that matters my nigga
Heard she trying to get back with a nigga, but wait
She all in my phone, won't leave me alone
Just a dog with a bone, see the kitty I chase
Twerk to the bass, twerk to the bass
A party ain't a party, till a little bit of coke’s in your face
At least that’s what they say
But all I need is weed and booze, a fly chick that don’t live by rules
And right now I believe that’s you, so what’s the word; I’m tryna leave with you
Heard they called you Thottie, you ain’t nothing like your mami
And you done smashed the homie and the homie said you got me, wassup
I promise I respect you, my daddy taught me better
See our generation messed up
We just the play the cards that we dealt, and if love is real like lust is real
It won’t be hard to get felt

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
He keep saying she a Thot, (she a thot, she a thot) but he ain’t met her father
And what makes it even worse, even worse, even worse that she ain’t met her father
And I ain’t trying to get to know her
Cause I focus only on the fly shit that I be quoting
My cardigan was so huxtable, this High Grade made her comfortable. Then she popped a perc, and set the mood
Got this hennesey there’s plenty weed, and you know it and you knew it, now we so fucked up that we stupid
Hallelujah, this is sinful, its so simple, she seduces with her two lips on this new stick. Just a new chick on my do-list but he foolish, not to think that she doing the same, but who could you blame?
We all came from that broken home
She still a queen, and Im a king, just a faded rose with a rolling stone. God damn. And we fucked up, so its fuck it
Just a generation disrupted, (Tryna break out the box we was stuffed in!)
And we lust it , we rebellious, rambunctious, fly niggas with gumption, she lady like and she thug it, and we love it, God damn. (One Hand in the Air)

[Hook][Produced by: Nascent & QB]

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]

Since we all understand this shit ain't never gon change
We all need to really try to make the best of it
I know its gon be things you can't change
But still you gotta make the best of it

[Verse 1: Onis]
Its no doubt im in better shape
Better form
Above the norm
Got a better taste like kettle corn
That bullshit im beyond that
Come journey with ya crony while I take a rewind back
Rewind that
Made some bad investments
Wasted time and finances
Not really a waste I learned a valued lesson
Couple foreclosures
Car repossession
Shit was hectic nigga had to pawn them vvs's
Under plenty pressure
But whats a young nigga to do when bills accrue thats far beyond his means
You see nobody never taught me how to handle cream
Helped some people I shouldn't have trying to keep it real
Hella spending sprees
Spacious loft above the Oprah store
I really lived it this is not a dream
All goody im woody
Back on my damn grind
Trying to inherit more carrots than keratin
Message in the bottle view the letter
Show effort nigga do better

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Onis]
Lesson 2
Came from the hands of a Betty Boop
Thought she was my boo
Drama queen amongst all things
But she was pretty in them Giddy boots
Quick to give a nigga the boot
Break up to make up
Sex added a boost
The love turned to lust
No more lovers deluxe
Black and Filipino
Thought I won boy I was yelling bingo
Plenty men know she love to mingle
Arguments in the coupe/that x-type
I guess the jag fit since im on to the next ride
I took that L like left eye
Can't lie that threw me for a loop like riding the redline
Had to regroup
Had to restrict circles
Rid myself of them Urkels
Now im riding solo blowing plenty green
All goody I'm woody
Back on my damn grind
Trying to inherit more carrots than keratin
Message in the bottle view the letter
Show effort nigga do better

[Hook][Verse 1: Kehlani]
Best friends and lovers
Can't seem to draw the line between each other
What is defined means nothing to a brother
You just don't give a damn, that's why I think I love ya
It's not fair, how easy I melt when you play with my hair
I ain't going nowhere, it's not right
I can't sleep without you anymore at night time
Not in this lifetime

[Hook 1: Kehlani]
Love ain't never been so close, but so far away
Like your mind is telling you to just back off
And your heart says just stay
What's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
If it's not too late, yeah you realise it one day
We can go to the movies boy, maybe we could hang out boy
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Verse 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
One day we're lovers, next day we're friends
Don't know where it begins or it ends
But let me tell you one thing going through a nigga's head
Most nigga's just scared
It feels too good to be true
Every time I'm with you
I'm ignoring what I'm next to

[Hook 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Cause love ain't never been so close, but so far away
It's like my mind is telling me to just back off
And my heart says just stay
Tell me what's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
And if it's not too late, maybe I realize it one day
We can go to the movies girl, maybe we could hang out girl
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Break: Kehlani & (BJ the Chicago Kid)]
(I'm down for you baby)
Babe I'm down for you
(Are you down for me)
I'm down for you
I'm down for you

[Hook 1: Kehlani & BJ the Chicago Kid]

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
And when I'm ready baby
Maybe it won't be too late
Maybe one day you find some guy
That won't treat you like I will
Better choose up, better hurry up
Time keeps ticking, but you're my lover[Will Smith]
"I've never really viewed myself as particularly talented. Where I excel is ridiculous, sickening work ethic, you know? While the other guy's sleepin', I'm workin'. While the other guy's eatin', I'm workin'. I have a great time with my life and I wanna share it."

Most people wake up if you ever turn the (lights on)
Cause it mess's up their dreams, they get mad like a (python)
Just like you, I'm tryna live my life (right)
And in the fight of life turn on the (lights)
And if you do that, then you'll be fine
Cause I remember dreaming, dreaming as a kid of me getting older
And exactly what I'mma do
I had to get ready cause I didn't know what time or place
To make my dreams come true

Then later onnnnnn...

I learned that you can't talk to losers bout winning
It ain't their language, they ain't never gonna get it
& Anything I can think of, I can make it come true
Just look @ me now I'm on DREAM II

My nigga Rico Love said turn the lights on
Cause you can see the truth a whole lot better with the lights on
Don't be afraid to turn the lights on
I've learned to dream with the lights on

[Will Smith]
"I want my life, I want my work, I want my family to mean something. If you are not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time."
"The first step before anyone else in the world believes it is you have to believe it. There's no reason to have a Plan B because it distracts from Plan A."

You just gotta find
Just let your ?
So I'll take it from here

And I've learned you can't tell everybody your plans
Cause sometime your dreams are bigger than them
You just gotta find your own place to grow
& just let your actions show them

So take it from me

I learned that you can't talk to losers bout winning
It ain't their language, they ain't never gonna get it
& Anything I can think of, I can make it come true
Just look @ me now I'm on DREAM II

My nigga Rico love say turn the light on
Cause you can see the truth a whole lot better with the lights on
Don't be afraid to turn the lights on
I've learned to dream with the lights on

[Will Smith]
"Greatness, is not this wonderful, esoteric, illusive, god-like feature that only the special among us will ever taste
You know? It's something that truly exists, in, all of us. It's very simple, this is what I believe, and, I'm willing to die for it. Period. It's that simple"
"I know who I am, I know what I believe, and that's all I need to know."[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Yeah, I know it gets hard
But we made it this far
And we never gonna stop
Even when we reach the top
Of our dreams

[V1 - Tunji]

I'm tryna reach the top of my dreams
That's why I'm mapping out the script and slowly plottin' my scenes
They never get the picture, even when they're watchin' that screen
That's why they underestimate me, cause I'm not what I seem
I'm quite different - entirely focused on making wise decisions
I'd rather risk a huge mistake than spend my life wishin'
I try to deal with every problem with the right vision
Cause when you're gone, it's just that coffin that you lie stiff in
Six feet under, makes me wonder
If I could go back in time and try to fix each blunder
That I made when I was younger, way before the hunger
Before these groupie broads was tryna save a brother number
See, I'm achievin' every part of my goals
And I'mma stay the same, no matter how far that I go
I think bright, even though inside I'm dark and I'm cold
Feel the pain in my heart and my soul - but I'm livin' my DREAMS

HOOK

[Verse 2 - Natti]

At last rap has it’s Dr. Parnassus for the masses
Living a dream with atlas as my mattress
Living a dream ‘cause the rent is fantastic
Haters get evicted on a daily basis
Middle finger notice waved in their faces
Let the door hit em where the good Lord split ‘em
PS...P players you missing the big picture
Get a million inch screen let your dream be seen
The world is a stage let your dream be scene
Backdrop and props for the finer things
Enjoy the spice of life on your fries and wings
And wash it down with something imported
If domestic ain’t the best at making you feel important
Aim high, poppin’ bottles will get boring
I can have Caviar dreams or Champaign wishes
Or a catfish sandwich with Champagne the stripper
Its my dream

[Verse 3 - Deacon]

Claim a victory for entering this world earth
Then play your symphony from city to the rural dirt
Beyond hurt, invert your neural confines
I hit the lines like I'm running in the combine
Intramural of the mind, drink ya night caps
Dream big nigga, play that shit in IMAX
My dream theater's a perpetual climax
Make miracles, give me water I'll give you wine back
For troops in IRAQ, Haitians in the Carib
Or my Arabs, who keep the faith and wear it like a scarab
Dreams prepare ya for living they holdin' key to life
Gotta be the sheriff when you have em try to read em right
Don't be impressed by things that haunt ya when you sleep at night
Just rise above it, right in public, catch an eagle flight
Tap that passion that's within ya and just let it breath
I heard it whisper words of wisdom would ya let it be, please.. let it be

[OUTRO - BJ THE CHICAGO KID][Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]

Fair Eastside High, Fair Eastside
By thy side we'll stand and always praise thy name
To heaven, yeah lend our hearts and hands to help increase thy fame. (oh lord)
The honor yeah, of old Eastside High brings forth our loyalty. (loyalty loyalty)
So cheer for dear old Eastside High lead on to victory[Produced by DJ Ozone]

[Intro: Slum Village]
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick (On the mic like it's a dick)
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit (The shit)
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
What's good, good? And what's good, evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And whys God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills, down I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya Kna Wha Mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young cause it just not cool

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
Cause they help me beat my demons ass

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
(3x)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Saba]
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against we tryna get lucky
Doper than Lucky
You're ending happy that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless IGH

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid][Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith, all you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of 4
That's 4 innocent bastards cause Papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice."
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Punch]
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a God?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it[Intro: ill Camille]
Ugh...Check

[Verse 1: iLL Camille]

Millie is chillin'
Tryin' to earn a livin'
What more can I say
I live day-to-day and deal with the mistakes made
My mission is different from yall niggas I'm straight
My ambition proclaimed in everything that I say
So tell the constellations I'm on my way up
Cause at this very minute yall
My daddy is laid up with a pacemaker for his heart
Strong, he's A-1
So I take heed to the day that he said that I rip and run too much
And I need to sit down for once
I can't kill myself trying to live and I can't be still
And still think I'mma win? (yeah)
Between the self-doubts and the odds being stacked as high as gas prices
It appears our only options are
Being rich and senseless, broke and righteous
Teenage moms is burnt, the kids is just like her
Judgement is nearing, everyday its reminders and we ignore it
Pretending we're immortal we can't afford to play with our lives
Like its 8 more in the corner store we can buy "for the low"
'Fore it's time for us to go
Wanna make sure my soul cool
Studio protocol, alcohol and Protools
Highgrade to heighten the mood
Playin' ignorant to the rules and Universal Code
That everything you do comes back 10-fold
10 years ago I was dying to be grown
10 years ago my good friend passed on
Died in a car crash, same exact birthdate
Year, day, everything
So its safe to say it hit home
But she's in a safe place
Me I'm still searching
Working through the hurt put the Roy Ayers on
I put on for mine, ain't a thing set in stone
Except death
Cause its a definite and what your Heaven is
[Ugh] is really relative
My relative said mine is in the Testament
Set precedent
Every lesson is designed to be a blessing in disguise
You'll find out

[Hook: Bj The Chicago Kid]

Ooooooooh
Yeah we all know life is all about the rhythm
But sometimes we get the Blues
But Mama said just keep on living
And that's the real nigga news

[Verse 2: iLL Camille]

We're void of checks and balances
Selling slogans, still living counterfeit
Self-abondonment
We deal a bad hand, can't handle it
"YOLO" is backward
I've come to understand that things we can't understand
We all want control of [life]
Love being one of em
Some of us runnin' toward the wrong one to make us feel comfortable
Tryin' to live "the dream" everybody ain't a Huxtable [ugh]

I'd rather run with 100 bums
If I had to choose that or have to go and front
Bout anything vehicle or income
Man I ain't being somethin' that I ain't
Everybody got a tongue, got my own taste
With a working pair of legs, run my own race
I won't do it just to say that I did it
My lungs functioning, can't say I'm living
But I'm alive, destiny's pre-written
So get ready, here I go
Consider this the rough draft
Thinking past tomorrow-type flow
Go- play invincible if you wanna
Ain't no escapin' especially when Karma is the hunter
Go- be a criminal if you wanna
Eternal life or fire
Everybody gets a summons
You'll find out

[Hook: Bj The Chicago Kid]
2x

Ooooooooh
Yeah we all know life is all about the rhythm
But sometimes we get the Blues
But Mama said just keep on living
And that's the real nigga news

---end-----[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
And so I party like it's 2012
Split the swisher open, put the green inside the L
Cause any day I could take an L
So my niggas gather around so they love the smell
This that kush my nigga, don't ever breathe, inhale
Lets get high touch the heavens, cause we in this hell
I'm thinkin' at times if I could take a shell
Livin' for the moment right now, I don't really care
My bitch rockin' Chanel, she ghetto sidity
Magnificent ass, incredible titties
She like to pull on my zipper when I'm on the highway
Doin' 85 and the '85 Sade
In the background, got my hat down
Feeling like a king, shout out to Sac Town
You lookin' at a gangsta in his finest hour
Till they lock me up or rain on me lead showers

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist
I can still tell you what time it is
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up
Been down so long the only way is up
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Gangtsa in his finest hour

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
(Boss) Fascinated with the gold Daytons
(Ross) Fast paper was the motivation
Jay got the esés, I know the Haitians
When I'm in LA we meet at Crustaceans
Butterfly all kilos
Show me the money cause I gotta feed my ego
Fuck a Bent coupe when all my niggas' rent due
Put my life on it, I can show you how a brick move (Whip It)
Baking soda make it moonwalk
White glove money stuffed in my tube socks
Top down thug life, 2Pac
I'mma boss, I can get ya whole crew chopped
Teflon Don on the rise
You know after 4 or 5 lines it's organized crime (Boss)
Mo money, Mo power
The world is yous, that's until I get my lead shower

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Overlookin' the skyline
Got money, wish it could buy time
Watch hustlas in they prime get confined to a 5x9, by a 5 star grind
I'm talking big money, boats and fur coats
Cars and gold ropes, scales and mo' dope
My big homie loaf, had it by the loaf
Got knocked, system tryna hang him by his throat
Downfall is when you considered the top dog
So my eyes open while I'm on top dog
Let them pussy niggas hate, I'mma do me
Fuck menage a trois, I'mma do 3
Roll up the doobie, let it burn slow
Let ya hair back, sip on this Merlot
You lookin' at a gangsta in his finest hour
Till they lock me up or rain on me lead showers

[Hook]
