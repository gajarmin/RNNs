[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs
At all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!

[Hook: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The Business)
Always getting fronted on at shows (The Business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the Business)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the games just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real...

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say "Where's my loot?"
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cos you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, "More soup with your meal?"
Cos this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...

[Verse 4: Phife]
Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cos they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cos your lyrics is butt

[Hook: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)

[Verse 5: Sadat X]
The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
"Oh, he's a cutie", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game
And I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

[Verse 6: Diamond D]
Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing ("Boy, get a job")
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild[Intro]
"Let me now turn, to our program for the future."

(News Snippets)
"The economy right now, is extremely supportive of the president and his policies."
"FBI scientists have found chemical traces, consistent with a bomb or a missile, on a piece of wreckage."
"police using clubs and tear gas against demonstrators."
"they called me a mother -(bleeped out)-ing so-and-so... and a white
Fascist...like they said, 'you're getting some of your own medicine'..."

[Hook]
Telling lies, to our vision
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our babies
Only truth, can take us...

[Verse 1]
You can't fool all the people all of the time
But if you fool the right ones, then the rest will fall behind
Tell me who's got control of your mind? your world view?
Is it the news or the movie you're taking your girl to?
Know what I'm saying cause Uncle Sam got a plan
If you examine what they telling us then you will understand
What they planting in the seeds of the next generation
Feeding our children miseducation
No one knows if there's UFOs or any life on Mars
Or what they do when they up in the stars
Because I don't believe a word of what the president said
He filling our head with lies got us hypnotized
When he be speaking in code words about crime and poverty
Drugs, welfare, prisons, guns and robbery
It really means us, there's no excuse for the slander
But what's good for the goose, is still good for the gander
See...

[Hook 1]
I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago I would've been a Panther
They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer
The views that you see in the news is propaganda

[Hook 2]

Verse 2:
I don't want no computer chip in my arm
I don't wanna die by a nuclear bomb
I say we all rush the pentagon
Pull out guns and grab the intercom
My first words will be I believe
Man made god, outta ignorance and fear
If God made man, then why the hell would he put us here?
I thought he's supposed to be the all loving
The same God who let Hitler put the Jews in the oven
We don't fall for the regular shit, they try to feed us
All this half-ass leadership, flipping position
They turn politician and shut the hell up and follow tradition
For your TV screen, is telling lies to your vision
Every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch
Running up in niggas cribs claiming that they heard shots
It's a plot, but busta can you tell me who's greedier?
Big corporations, the pigs or the media?
Sign of the times, terrorism on the rise
Commercial airplanes, falling out the sky like flies
Make me wonder what secrets went down with Ron Brown
Who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found?
It's not coincidence, it's been too many studied incidents
It could've been the Klan who put that bomb at the olympics
But it probably was the FBI, deep at the call
Cause if they make us all panic then they can start martial law

[Hook 1]

[Bridge]
Police is telling lies fooling millions
What are they teaching our kids in these school buildings?
Televised, enterprised in all the killing
Controlling our lives, this ain't living
No this ain't living

[Interlude x2]
FBI, CIA
ATF, KKK
IRS, TNT
CBS, NBC

[Outro: Huey P. Newton]
"Uh, we view each other with a great love and a great understanding. And that we try to expand this to the general Black population, and also, people-- oppressed people all over the world. And, I think that we differ from some other groups simply because we understand the system better than most groups understand the system. And with this realization, we attempt to form a strong political base based in the community with the only strength that we have and that's the strength of a potentially destructive force if we don't get freedom."[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Somebody mad at my hashtag
Instagram black man looking half a fag
With the blazer and dress
I'm just amazed at the mess
Pioneer of this queer shit is Kanye West
He introduced the skinny jeans to the rap scene
Then he wore a fucking skirt on a video screen
Then he wore it again at a memorial
I can't pretend that this shit ain't deplorable
I bet this nigga think he looking adorable
Your music good, but your ego is horrible
Now these other niggas wanna follow suit
I tell the truth
Talk shit, you'll be swallowin a tooth
Duckin hollows in the booth
Wishing that you showed the respect to an OG you followed as a youth
I rebuke all this gay shit, some are scared to say shit
You might lay and take this, but I'm not to be played with

[Hook]
Lift up your skirt, lift up your skirt
Lift up your skirt, yeah, kid, lift up your skirt
Is it pussy or balls? I give a fuck if you ball
These fuck niggas wanna make suckers of us all

[Outro]Intro:
"I was born, in a dump
My mama died and my father got drunk
They left me, to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a rusty shack
All I owned was hangin on my back
And Lord knows, how I learnt
This place called Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road, you're dirty and you're filthy
Tobacco Road, gonna get me some dynamite and a crane
I'm gonna blow it up, Lord knows gonna start all over again"

"My mind is the place where I make my plans
The world is the place where I take my stand
The beauty of life is mine today
They cannot take my mind away"

[M1]
Fuck what you heard, I'm from Africa
This ain't no act it's mathematical
Past the black radical
I choose the M1 because it's practical
Nothin was changed, we ain't protected
No names, it's all factual
They push the wrong buttons, count down to detonate
Brooklyn blown away and the world will have to speculate
This is what we learn in the streets, fuck a degree
Believe in none of what you hear and half of what you see

[Stic]
It's like watching your own father smoke crack
I have nightmares on shit like that
No way in hell I'll ever get like that
I seen a lot of shit in twenty-two years
It's like a tour of duty
My life is booby-trapped, it's hard to see the beauty
When your heart is turning ice cold
Cold like your hands exposed to blistering winds
My mother keep her eyes closed, she say she prayin
I listen close to what she sayin
When she speak of Jesus I ignore it
But when it's practical I'm all for it
You got to think like a soldier
I'm training myself to snatch pistols out of holsters
Discipline keep the mind focused
This whole world is a corn field son
Look out for flying locusts

Chorus (x2)

Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you wanna do?

[M1]
You can't walk the streets with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
And if you know the time, give me a sign
Tell me where we draw the line, I got your back if you got mine
My enemy's enemy is my man, one dreadlock is stronger than one strand
While the crackers got the upper hand my comrades stands
On lands stolen
Every tooth a golden opportunity, who holding my community
Hostage? 10% ransom
Costing us time we lost and some
This is how the plan runs, thinking with a fugitive brain
What we do to live is insane
Hold in the weed, healing my membranes, just like crack
You know it all boils down to the dollars-and-cents of it
Niggas commence to get rents to sentenced to serve terms
Jumping the fence, the black germ is loose
When will they learn?
Psychology

[Stic]
We piss on walls and smoke reefa in the halls
No respect for their laws
I cut your face with a kitchen knife
In gladiator times, man against machinery
The tree bark fatigues help me blend in with the scenery boy
Life is a series of serious choices
Theories is formed from experience, never mysterious forces
Various courses of life can lead to failure
Too much of anything is a trap
My mind snap
Guerilla warfare for two grand
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man...
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man

Chorus (x2)

Bridge

[M1]
When you think of us think of pyramids and pistols
And glimmering gold teeth that shine like crystals
The mind is like a jewel son
Only a fool wouldn't grasp it
Wisdom is a tool, you get blasted

"Free your mind, and the rest will follow
Seize the time, no one is promised tomorrow"

Repeat until fade[Lord Jamar]
I be the All Eye Seeing, Supreme Being
Black Man, the colored man is the European
Ran up to his cave, he was fleeing
Over hot sand, steal from me and I chop hands
Off, that's Islamic law
The sight alone'll make you wanna vomit on the floor
I study 120, the Qur'an and the Bible
Doing my job, the God got plenty disciples
Taking my rightful place, amongst kings and queens
85's wanna know what things mean
Sweep the devil off the earth, like spring clean
My earth's rock 3/4's, never bring jeans
G-O-D, take a little look through my P-O-V
You see I be O.G., turn a devil into John D-O-E
That mean D-O-A, it's gon' be OK

[Hook 2X: Lord Jamar]
I be the Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
Here to drop bombs on the mentally dead
Islam'll, keep you properly fed
And to the four devils, yo, I'm choppin' yo head

"Well how you be God?"

[Lord Jamar]
I be all wise and civilized
Deliver truth while the 10 percent deliver lies
His devilishment, has been solidified
I be the Five Percent, opitimized
When you in the presence of God, you better recognize
Before your life gets jeopardized
I'm bout to exercise my right to bare arms
See me in a wife beater, nothing but bare arms and tattoos
I hit a muthafucka hard like bad news
Some people say I'm nuts like cashews, and that's true
I mash through in a black truck, strapped up
Busting from the driver's side, you either ride or die
All praise due to the Most High
I blaze you with my four-five
This is Jihad music, see the God do it
Allah U Akbar, Lord Jamar's the truest

[Hook 2X][Verse 1]
Yo, it's a beautiful day, and everybody's feelin' wonderful
The ladies is out, lookin' fly, dressed comfortable
I love to wake up, and feel the breeze through my window
Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo
It be days like these, that make life so much easier
Fish thawin' out, Guinness Stout in the freezer
Walk the block at my leisure (my leisure)
Summertime is like a anesthesia
So many pretty things to please ya
The greenery
Beautiful birds, natural scenery
Or even just a infinite sky
We be forever puffin' lah
On the block, or tellin' jokes in the ride (ha ha ha)
When the weather be hot, everybody be outside (whut)
Havin' fun (aight?), eatin' fresh fruits and vegetables
And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual (sup, boo)
It's instinct -- that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this, full of Happiness

[Hook]
I feel great
Even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin'
Feelin' fine
Leavin' my bad times behind
Feels great
And no, we can't escape from the realness
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be alive
Feelin' fine
Livin' life one day at a time
Feelin' great

[Interlude]
Yeah, knaw'msayin'?
I just wanna give a shout out
To everybody who got a birthday today
Happiness (Happiness)

[Verse 2]
Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cuz it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cuz it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life, 'cuz every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (whut)
You can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind

You asked for it who want beef well here's war

Fuck what you heard don't even speak bout my fleet
Many pop shit but bitch when dem see me
Rock out of the realms of dark in BuckTown
Me and Ruck we don't, give a, wiggy what now (wiggy what now)
I wonder, if heads are ready or are they butter
Ain't near one of y'all bitch niggas tough
You can get your clans, posses, cliques bring the strategy
We starts mad ruckus and rock domes while we got a G
My soldiers gone psycho let the madness begin (let it begin)
Enter the square if you dare bring a friend
We-a snipe ya, we see in the dark like an owl
So we prowl understand the plan is operation lockdown
Sean Price will slice that punk shit you reppin G
Drugs jewels and Versace niggas need therapy
Enter the great unknown, nocturnal images of
Sparsky and Dutch the power forward and the center (whatever)
Needless to mention, this means war
So with the help of my twin shark and boot camp
I declare Heltah Skeltah

We be the W, W, B.C.C

We continue, smashin crews
Ringin more bells than Mont Raceways and Avenues

Here we come (repeat until fades)Our people are poor, and you know damn well nobody wants to be poor
This play is gonna show how the pigs react when the people start
To take community, control over what belongs to them
And liberate it back (echoes)

Sometimes I just don't care

[Verse 1]
Murderation, modern hand gun education
Price of your life is goin up it ain't inflation
Incrimination, they got my picture at the station
Elimination, state to state we eaten by this nation
Them belly full, my trigger finger got pull
To cut the bull shots'll warm your flesh like wool
These tools for survival make fools out of rivals
Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there ain't another place to run
Eat your own gun, scared because my people never known fun

[Verse 2]
Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough la to take my sins away
This E&J be freein us in it's own special way son
We live for the day, the only way dunn
The violence in me, reflect the violence that surround me
I choose that wildly Mr. Charlie keep his eye on me
To figure my head, but them ass kissin niggas is dead
We learn the chokeholds with fisherman's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins, I hope that something is done to them
Problem is they're killing them, it reminds me of something like what
Happened to Lincoln

You ain't even safe wit a full clip
I swear on the president's grave
I'm sick of livin in this bullshit
We down to take it to the full length
Meet us up on Capitol Hill, and we can get up in some real shit
(repeat)

Assassination, *gunshot* yeahVerse One: Lord Jamar

7 in the mornin, they kickin down my momma's door
Now tell me what is this motherfuckin drama for?
Can a nigga get rest after rest without the stress?
Then they put the Glock to my chest
Best think 'fore I twitch or I'm popped
Off to the clink with this bitch ass cop
They gotta nigga locked like the dread on my head, jack
And if I try to fight back, well then I'm dead, black
I got the right to an attorney and to stay silent
They got the right to try to burn me if I play violent
I know the game so I just roll with the procedure
Illegal search and seizure, somethin that they're doin at their leisure
Down at the station, interrogation is takin place
Overcrowded jails but for me they're makin space
Tell the devil to his face he can suck my dick
It's the whole black race that they're fuckin with
Come to find my crime was lettin brothers know the time
Only the devil is stoppin me from eatin swine
And plus my prior record sealed my fate
One For All and In God We Trust got me sent upstate
But still I won't bite my tongue
I just write tight shit to incite the young, to fight the one
Who keeps them on a level that's minimum
That's the number one reason

Chorus: (sample of Luther Ingram's "I'm Tryin To Sing A Message To You")

Verse Two: Sadat X

I was frustrated, I can't do no more push-ups
Niggas be swole up, locked down cos of a hold-up
"The devil made me do it" is what I say
Got some bad news on my one phone call the other day
"I love the kids and I teach em to love their father
I'll get you some kicks and try to send some flicks
But it's over, baby, yes it's over"
Ain't much you can do when you're holdin a phone
A million inmates but ya still alone
You're not cryin but inside ya dyin
You might cry in the night when ya safe and outta sight
Damn I miss my peeps and the rides in the jeeps
And my, casual freedom, where's my crew when I need em?
A visit ain't the same like being in the game
But I'll take it, at least with that I'll make it
The beast is a bitch and I see it
I do the knowledge to em, so next time I can do em
"Yo X, I got ta lock it now but write me real soon
I know that you're a busy man, give me a minute"
You can never know the penal til you been locked the fuck up in it

Chorus:

Really y'all niggas feel me when we step on the spot
Lyrics on cock, stroke and pop, open crews that's hopin
That the punishment ceases MC with masterpieces

Now I heard the silliest shit from this crackhead bitch
I asked her why she smoked that shit, she said "we all can't be rich"
She said, "I'm hopeless, like a penny with a hole in my soul"
Then she asked me my goal, I said to live to grow old
And watch my seeds grow and teach those who need to know
And if my shorties need me, deliver like Domino's
See the name of the game of life is maintain
Your mind won't grow if you can't feed the brain
Through the coming years a lot of blood, sweat and tears
Poured a lot of beers for my niggas who ain't here
My pops used to school me - I'mma keep it real with you
You can play the corner all you want 'till one day it's gon' get you
Got to get up, get out and get something
Or you can sit around all day and do nothing
See that's the main reason why that we pour a lot of beer
Cause there's mad niggas gone but the corner's still there so

They say you only get better with age
Fine wine gets better with time, fruit get ripe on the vine
Truth bring light when it shines
I'm at my best, like Tyson in his prime
And that goes for the raps and the beats
I make songs for those trying to escape but trapped in the streets
And y'all 'bout to see that I'm 'bout to be on MTV
Looking off a penthouse balcony
And I've been fucking with birds like falcons, we
Off the handle and steel like alchemy
Just for keeping it real like Malcolm, G
OD it'll all reveal
When they, crown me king then you all will kneel
I'm 'bout to, drop some shit that you all will feel
The seed's been planted, now look at all the vegetation
I'm trying to see my family straight for generations
Give me my reparations

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
I'm not the richest, not by far
And I ain't got 24 inches on the car
And I doubt that you'll ever see me at the car show
And I work every day, ain't got that star dough
But my daughter keep me grounded
Surrounded by good friends and my brothers, and a few others
That I met on the road, like here and abroad
And the Brand Nubian name remain with respect
All of us still here and that's much more than a check
Still growing and our family correct, tap the bottle
And I guess you could say that I'm a role model
Of how to make it without hitting the lotto, and that's life
From a man to a boy, from build to destroy
We born again, yo it's back on again
One more trip across the globe
One more run for the roses, the door never closes
Until we shut it right

[Chorus][Vlad]
Have you heard Eminem's "Rap God"?

[Jamar]
Yes I have.

[Vlad]
OK. And there's a big uproar about some of the homophobic lyrics on it.

[Jamar]
Good! Good! (laughs) Because, as long as there's a standard for everybody. I say some shit, y'all act like I'm, y'know...

And first of all, could we stop with this word "homophobic"? Could we stop with that? Who the fuck are y'all to diagnose a medical condition?

OK? Cause a phobia is a medical condition! So how are you gonna say that somebody is homophobic? You're not a doctor, K? Stop throwing around these codewords that try to... that you try to use to silence somebody. Homophobia is actually the fear of speaking out against homosexuals. It's not a fear of homosexuals, y'know what I mean? It's the fear of speaking against them. That's what homophobia is to me. And that's what a lot of us suffer from. But me being in disagreement of something doesn't give me a phobia. It just means I don't agree with them! Are they heterophobes? Are homosexuals heterophobes? Cause I know plenty of homosexuals that be "Agh, that's disgusting, to have sex with a woman!" They'd say that's disgusting! They probably start throwing up in they mouth a little bit. Does that mean they're heterophobes? And who am I to call them a heterophobe? I'm not a doctor. So stop throwing around, uh, medical terms, and just applying them to people. Y'know what I mean?

You can't call me a homophobic, you can't call me a schizophrenic, you're not qualified to say that! So we gonna have to come up with some new words, some new words! But y'all motherfuckers got these codewords you use to try to neutralize somebody whenever they speak! But I'm not going for it!

At the end of the day, y'know, it's not about... being against homosexuality and being against white people and all of this. It's about being against the powers that be trying to make the unnatural natural, and the natural unnatural. If you really think about it, every facet of life, they're trying to make the unnatural, natural. From the food we eat to the air we breath, to the type of sexual relationships we have. OK now let's just take the emotion out of this real quick. I just want to follow this hypothetical thing to it's natural conclusion. Let's say hypothetically tomorrow, we all turn gay. K, everybody is now gay. Man is with man, woman is with woman. How do we as a species reproduce ourselves? Man on man can't make a child, woman on woman... so how do we reproduce ourselves? I'll tell you how: Unnaturally. We'd have to do it through test-tubes and things of that nature. Now, right now, today, when only a small percentage of the population needs artificial insemination and things like that in order to reproduce themselves because they might have reproductive problems, it's already expensive to have a child in that artificial type of manner. Now imagine when everybody has to do it, and we're dealing in a capitalist society where it's all about supply and demand, the more demand you have for a product the higher the um, price of that product will go. Because you can demand whatever price it is because the demand is so high, the supplier has the leverage. So, if we all have to now pay, I'm talking, hundred thousand dollars to have a child, who's going to get the shit end of the stick, when it comes to reproducing? Poor people. Not black people, not... poor people! It's not even about race, it's about economics! It's about the haves against the have-nots! So poor people will not be able to afford to reproduce themselves. Whereas rich people will be able to choose, y'know, the color of the eyes, the intelligence, all of that, once they get into genetics. If a black person manages to scrape enough money to have a child, y'know, they might have enough for a one-legged, y'know, mentally incapacitated child. You dig what I'm saying?

And we have to look past what seems on face value to be an issue, as far as sexual rights and the rights of others to love each other. That's not what it's about. That's not what it's about, and the end of the day, this goes right up there with y'know, birth control, y'know, condoms, and sending people to jail, and murder, and all the other drugs, all the other things and tools that have been used to try to control the population. I don't know if you've ever heard of the Georgia Guidestones, but, look up the Georgia Guidestones OK? Now these are some stones that were put up in the hills of Georgia, I guess somewhere outside of Atlanta or something like that, huge stones, no one has claimed responsibility for putting up these stones but on these stones are supposed to be a blueprint for humanity. And on one of these things, they suggest that humanity should be kept, should be no more than five-hundred million people worldwide. Now you know how many people are on the planet Earth right now? If you Google it it's gonna tell you seven billion. How do you, where are all these other people going? How do you go from seven billion to five-hundred million? Lotta people gotta die and a lotta people have to not be born, in order for that to happen. So at the end of the day, let's not get it twisted. This is not about the rights for you to so-called love whoever you wanna love. Cause at the end of the day love is the strongest thing in the universe, and all people have a right to love all people, kay? But it's not about that. It's not about that. They're using one issue to really push another.  And at the end of the day, it's about trying to eradicate the poor people from the planet Earth, as well as the genetic survival of... a genetically weak species.[Vlad]
Seemed like there was a lot of uproar over Jay Z wearing a Five Percent Nation chain

[Lord Jamar]
Hmm

[Vlad]
How long have you been a Five Percenter?

[Lord Jamar]
Ah... I want say, y'know, around 30 years

[Vlad]
Are you aware that Jay Z's a Five Percenter?

[Lord Jamar]
Uh, no I am not

[Vlad]
So you have no idea whether it's just a chain or whether he's actually a part of the Five Percent Nation?

[Lord Jamar]
I have no idea... I mean, there's been little hints, you understand what I'm saying? I've heard him for a while now, dropping little things in his music. Saying little, giving slight acknowledgements to the Gods, and uh shit even to us. Y'know? "Only God can judge me so I'm gone. Either love me or leave me alone." Y'know what I mean? And especially on the last album, on that Holy Grail, y'know he got a song called Heaven where he's shouting out the Gods basically, "Arm Leg Leg Arm Head this is God body". But as far as actually coming out and proclaiming that he's God, and coming amongst the Gods, and building with the Gods, and making knowledge born, making understanding understood, he has not done that. That's something that if he is interested in obtaining knowledge of self or if he has been studying unbeknownst to us, that's something that we'd like to know, y'know? Because we love to welcome him in, and make sure that what he's learning, he's learning correctly. But usually someone who's not in the Five Percent Nation doesn't wear our flag. Y'know what I mean? That's something that's usually reserved for people within the Nation. The Nation of Gods and Earths. So, y'know, I'm not upset with him. It's not like I'm upset that he's wearing it. I think it's actually, it's helping to raise awareness about us

Listen, I seen 'Melo with a similar chain. The first time I saw it I thought it was 'Melo's chain. Now I know that Jay Z is into the sports management and all of that right now. So my initial thing when I first saw him wearing it was almost like "Oh he trying to get at 'Melo right now". Y'know what I mean he trying to get 'Melo down with that Roc Nation sports shit and he's letting him know like "I fucks with you. I fucks with the Gods, I know about the Gods." Or maybe that was 'Melo's and 'Melo's his homeboy and he was like "Let me rock that chain", I don't know

See it's all the mystery surrounding it. See within the Five Percent Nation we make knowledge born, we make knowledge known, y'know what I mean? And we make understanding understood so that you have a crystal clear picture in your mind what's going on. The mysterious nature of not knowing exactly why he's wearing it and what the significance is to him is... it's not in line with how we usually do things

[Vlad]
Y'know when you look at the backlash over Jay Z wearing that Five Percent chain was that, y'know, one of the ideas of the Five Percent Nation in the media is that the Five Percent feels that white people are Devils. According to you, are white people Devils?

[Lord Jamar]
Yep. (Laughs) But now with that being said, white people come from the black man and the original Devil, the strongest Devil, is the black devil. So are white people Devils by themselves? No. They come from a stronger version of the Devil, which was the original black man. And when we speak of God and Devil, we are not speaking in the same terms that you would think of a God and Devil, how you've been traditionally taught as far as within religion. We redefine what God and Devil is, and what it means to us, and it's not anything spooky, it's a frame of mind, basically. And even white and black, is not necessarily a skin color it's a frame of mind. So is the white man the Devil? Yes he is. But do I mean just the caucasian skinned person? No, the white man of mind, the white mind, the one that goes against nature, the one that murders and rapes and steals, the unrighteous mind, is the Devil. And that can be within all different skin colors of people. But yes, the white man is the Devil[Intro: Lord Jamar]
Uh, let's take a trip
Trip into the mind...
The mind of the wise...

[Lord Jamar]
Okay, uh, enter the seventh dimension
Witness my ascension into the heavens
Like Christ on the third day, I'm nice with my wordplay
Master of all that I survey
Standing on my square, firm
Grafted germ trying to shake my foundation
Nation of Gods & Earths, birthed by the father
If he didn't love us, then why would he bother?
Universal mathematician, I shine like the sun
Look at how I flash against it
Basking Arabians, melenin, soaks up my energy
Brings cancer to my enemies
Knowledge the God, as I build/destroy
Black hole, watch me as I fill the void
I'm light years beyond, my word is my bond
Stay tuned, you've only heard a third of the song

[Interlude: Lord Jamar]
That's right, just a third of the song..
No more, the stars, the milky way, the solar system

[RZA]
Yo, this is deep space, when I was young, we couldn't teach pace
We got evicted, moms would play numbers, on sweepstakes
To hate to pay rent, arms stay bent, step-pops in state pen
Old dad been gone ever since, I was three
Had no one to show me how to set me free
Or give me a clue, on who, I'm supposed to be
I was a mommy's boy, soft, Uncle Tommy Boy
Walking the streets, like a dead zombie, boy
Swine eating, lying, cheatin, praying to a white Jesus
Never thought the first man on Earth, it could be us
Got blessed with the twelve jew-els, learned they could do me well
Helped find God in man, like Emmanuel
Whose the original, whose the grafted criminal
Who crafted trick knowledge, to attack, the subliminal
Subconscious stages, I got the book, turned the pages
Learned one hundred and twenty, and nine phases
Of the moon, stay in tune, all praises due
The truth is what raises you

[Hook 2X: Lord Jamar]
The universal builder, supreme architecht
Lord Jamar and, I'm about to spark the set
Touch my Earth and, you might as well be marked for death
Deep space, if it still get darker, yet

[Lord Jamar]
Uh, let's take a trip through the galaxy
Mystery God is a phalacy
Celestial being, mothership over the White House
See that, had your President shook
Take a self evident look, through the telescopic lens
Magnefy my truth, the milky way couldn't satisfy my sweet tooth
Amplified my beats is proof of light up
I only do as right, you only do as left
Now tell me whose the best, Lord Jamar, I got a constellation of stars
You only did your observation from afar
Twenty three scientists, blow the moon from the Earth
Covers on the three/fourth, lover of my heat source
I meet force with force, fighting fire with fire
Space dust, watch me get higher and higher
King of the Universe, call me Messiah

[Interlude: Lord Jamar]
Knowhatimean, praise the child (call me Messiah)
Bow down the Gods, that's right
Ruler of the Universe... yo, come on

[Hook 2X]

Uh thats right
Uuh Big Kap I see youGivin' up... is hard to do (3x)
When youuuuuuu, givin' up someone

[Lord Jamar]
Yo, maybe I should rhyme about guns and crack
Then I might sell like tons of stacks
Sometimes I tell myself, fuck the truth
"But it's just no use"
Shit, I can rhyme about bitches and cars
I even tried switching my bars
I said righteous rap is dead to make an excuse, but
"No I can't break loose"
Sometimes I think about leaving again
Already accomplished in leaving a name
Maybe I should just go out with a bang
"But it's just no use"
I can't do it, my love for black people's too strong
Rhymed with a purpose for too long
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refuse
"No I can't break loose"

Givin' up... is hard to do (3x)
When youuuuuuu, givin' up someone

[Lord Jamar]
They tried to offer me platinum and diamonds
Anything to make me stop rhyming
They went through great lengths to try to seduce
"But it's just no use"
Cause I, can't be bought, I can't be sold
I'm understanding God, I can't be old
Some people just can't be told
"No I can't break loose"
Somebody gotta be the voice of reason
Especially when it's killing season
We trying to close the wound, the blood is perfused
"But it's just no use"
Penitentiary steel, we got centuries
At bedtime, doing fed time
I'mma have to get my sentence reduced
"No I can't break loose"

"In 1963, a young minister at Malcolm X's mosque in New York City
A man named Clarence X, broke with the Nation of Islam
He changed his name to Allah, and took his less astere vision
Of Islam, directly to young people in Harlem
He called his new movement: The Five Percent Nation"

[Lord Jamar]
Greatest story never told, Clarence Smith
Clarence 13X, to the Father Allah, let's go
Aiyo, February 22nd, 1928
Danville, Virginia, it was still the winter
Clarence Smith, he was born on a Friday
The fifth son, of Louis and Mary
After him, came Bernice and Harry
Now that's seven, six boys, one girl
Who ever thought he would change the world
His mother nicknamed him Put, and simply put
This was the time during Jim Crow
Where laws dictated where a nigga could go
But the fam didn't care, I don't wanna be around whitey
I don't wanna go where I know they don't like me
In '46, Allah came to Harlem
To join his mother, and his older brothers
Once in New York, Put became pudding
Yeah, the God was smooth
He performed odd jobs, he was an honest dude
Amongst them, fruit stand that he ran
In a little hole in the wall, this was Harlem, ya'll
Developed a love for gambling
Played a lotta pool, took fools for they jewels
Then he met Willeen, wanted to marry, but she was only seventeen
Needed her mother's permission, they still had 2 sons, even though she was bitching
Allah said "I got something for you"
You don't have don't have the only daughter, then he married Dora
He had two seeds with her
Clarence and Christine, they were hers
And that's just the way it was, back in the day
When Allah came up, just the greatest story never told
Greatest story never told

[Hook 2X: sample]
"Hey, hey, now what I say"

[Lord Jamar]
In 1950, Clarence joined the army
And went to fight in the Korean war
Seeing war, it had to effect him
Supporting two families, you had to respect him
While he away, Dora became Muslim
N.O.I., Honorable Elijah Muhammed
When Clarence returned, he too accepted
By the teachings of Islam, he was truly effected
Temple Number 7, Minister Malcolm X
This was the time that Allah met Justice
Clarence became Student Minister over time
He said some things that put him over the line
He said the Black Man's God, not just Fard
Please, let's go yell it in the yard
But the Nation said no, you gots to go
He took Justice, and some brothers and he left the temple
Back to the streets of Harlem
This time to teach black youth not reached by Muslims
Birth of a Nation, with far reaching implications
1963 is the shit to me, cuz that's the year that the God made history
Looked himself and said it ain't no mystery
This the greatest story never told

[Hook 2X]

[Lord Jamar]
Allah made, Supreme Mathematics, Supreme Alphabets
A profound way to break it down
He took it to the poor and the hardcore
Young thugs and niggas on drugs
First born student by the name of Kareem
Had the power to attract black knowledge seed
Kareem became Black Messiah
Now let me run the first borns by ya
It was Kareem, Niheem, Uhura, Kiheem
Al Jabar or Prince Allah, Al Jamel, Bilal or Jihad, Akbar, and Al Salaam
They called Allah the Father, they were from broken homes
And this man was the only father they had known
Allah's Nation of the Five Percenters
Will soon influence the epicentre
Allah got shot, and soon after arrested
Before the judge, Allah contested
You got it wrong, I'm Allah, I tell you
The judge said you crazy, and shipped him to Bellevue
This is the greatest story never told
The greatest story never told

[Hook 2X]

[Lord Jamar]
Allah got, sent to Matteawan, First Borns carried on
We could live to wait it, and got situated
In '67, Allah came home, we had our first parliament and see how we had grown
They were thousands of Five Percenters, Allah had to borrow some Muslims
They said "I surrender", 21-22, Seventh Avenue
It was a gift from the mayor, and we still right there
Shamgaudd designed the flag, we put it on the window of the street acad'
In '68, Dr. King was assassinated, many cities got decimated
That night in Harlem, the Gods were out
Helping to keep the peace, 85's wanna wild out
The same year, Allah prepared, his Five Percent Nation for the day he wouldn't be here
If I die, I don't want you cry, if I could, I'll reach up and slap you in the eye
Besides, if you keep on teaching, I'll live forever
But physically, no man lives forever
June 12th, 1969, indelible in the God's minds
Allah Just took us through the science, of male and female
But we didn't notice the details
Cuz when he left, he got in the cab
But it wasn't in Allah's cab, didn't observe that
Shortly after, the word came back
That Allah got gunned down, Five Percenters rushed down
To Amlocate Towers, hundred 12th street
In the elevators where the God fell, G
Many Gods were crying, at least one remembered
What Allah said, didn't let a tear shed
We said fareful at community chapel
As to who killed Allah to this day, we're baffeled
These funeral posses the firm, clear for his cremation
This is the Nation of his creation
This is the greatest story never told
Greatest story never told

[Hook]

[Sample]
"Allah was assassinated in 1969, that case was never solved
His movement survived him, today it's known as the Nation of Gods & Earths
Or the Five Percenters, tens of thousands of young black men & women
Follow his teachings, among them, several top performers
Including Busta Rhymes and members of Wu-Tang Clan"[Verse 1]
Yo, it's a beautiful day, and everybody's feelin' wonderful
The ladies is out, lookin' fly, dressed comfortable
I love to wake up, and feel the breeze through my window
Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo
It be days like these, that make life so much easier
Fish thawin' out, Guinness Stout in the freezer
Walk the block at my leisure (my leisure)
Summertime is like a anesthesia
So many pretty things to please ya
The greenery
Beautiful birds, natural scenery
Or even just a infinite sky
We be forever puffin' lah
On the block, or tellin' jokes in the ride (ha ha ha)
When the weather be hot, everybody be outside (whut)
Havin' fun (aight?), eatin' fresh fruits and vegetables
And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual (sup, boo)
It's instinct -- that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this, full of Happiness

[Hook]
I feel great
Even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin'
Feelin' fine
Leavin' my bad times behind
Feels great
And no, we can't escape from the realness
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be alive
Feelin' fine
Livin' life one day at a time
Feelin' great

[Interlude]
Yeah, knaw'msayin'?
I just wanna give a shout out
To everybody who got a birthday today
Happiness (Happiness)

[Verse 2]
Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cuz it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cuz it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life, 'cuz every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (whut)
You can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind

[Hook]{What the hell was your dick doin in the milk man?}

[Rock]

You asked for it who want beef well here's war

Fuck what you heard don't even speak bout my fleet
Many pop shit but bitch when dem see me
Rock out of the realms of dark in BuckTown
Me and Ruck we don't, give a, wiggy what now (wiggy what now)
I wonder, if heads are ready or are they butter
Ain't near one of y'all bitch niggas tough
You can get your clans, posses, cliques bring the strategy
We starts mad ruckus and rock domes while we got a G
My soldiers gone psycho let the madness begin (let it begin)
Enter the square if you dare bring a friend
We-a snipe ya, we see in the dark like an owl
So we prowl understand the plan is operation lockdown
Sean Price will slice that punk shit you reppin G
Drugs jewels and Versace niggas need therapy
Enter the great unknown, nocturnal images of
Sparsky and Dutch the power forward and the center (whatever)
Needless to mention, this means war
So with the help of my twin shark and boot camp
I declare Heltah Skeltah

We be the W, W, B.C.C

Ringin more bells than Mont Raceways and Avenues

Repeat 4X

Here we come (repeat until fades)[Starr]
I'll keep, holding on
I'll keep, holding on!

[Lord Jamar]
Young black male, twenty-five years of age
Many-a-lives didn't survive to this stage
Cause the rage of another brother got him popped
Shot him and he dropped, like a beanbag
Mean motherfucker with a rag and some jeans that sag
They signify your death by crossin out your tag
Then they go and brag that they took another life
Never to think, do a brother got a mother and a wife?
Trife when a nigga do the work of the Klan
That's what you're doin when you ruin the life of a black man
Attack plan on self
The man's got the family jewels, so I guess we're buryin wealth
All because we've been taught to despise what's black
Open your eyes you oughta realize the fact
That you've been gettin used like a trick
You think you're mighty, but yo, whitey got your head sick
See you were fed thick pieces of swine as a baby

It only help to drive your mind crazy
Now your blind days be over
No more standin on line, tryin to find Jehovah
Let us rewind to a time we was right and just
Nowadays we just fight and bust
One another in the back over crack, a carjack
Will get you killed, watch the blood get spilled
To the scale, then watch how fast they build the jail
Now they got you holdin on to a cell, well...

[Starr]
I'll keep, holdin on
I'll keep, holdin on!!
I'll keep, holdin on
I'll keep, holdin on!!

[Sadat X]
Why it gotta be me B? I just came to chill
Came to see the flicks, nuttin more nuttin less
Try to show love even on a bad day
I roll up, I'm never hold up, the L is swoll up
The beef in the mind is definitely a winner
Oh that's that rappin nigga, I thought he was much bigger
Do you know this girl named nah B I don't know nothin
Did that name-game shit right from the go get
Shorty want an autograph, can I sign it at the end
Oh I think I'm all of that now, so now it's fuck Brand Nubian
Should I call you a bitch, or should I maintain?
I'm just here with my lady, and you came witcha man
This would force him to front, and I'm sure he don't want it
Over some old bullshit, when I'm quick to pull shit
Live dad, everything is everything
I got a lotta shit to do I can't afford to catch a charge
I'm a product of the streets, and I couldn't make no peace
All the real hard shit I know, is on the down low
Straight for real estate, on a scale I place your fate
Now I'mma let you skate, you was a little weeded
And I seen you don't need it
So hold on with your bad self...

[Starr]
I'll keep, holdin on
I'll keep, holdin on!!
I gotta hold on!
I'll keep, holdin on
My word is bond, I gotta be strong
I'll keep, holdin on!!
And keep holdin on, yeah
Ya see life's gettin rough but I gotta hold on
All these little suckers want me alone
Yeah, yeah, yeahhh!!
Ya see life's gettin rough but I gotta hold on
All these little suckers want me alone
Yeah, they want me alone
Yeah, yeah yeah
But I gotta hold on
Because my word is bon
And it's on and on, on and on, on and on
On ya...
I gotta hold on
Yeah yeah yeahhhh yeah yeahhh yeahhh
Ohhhhh yeahh yeahh yeah
Yeahh!
*fades*[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Nowadays everybody try'na get on
They don't wanna put in work, they just ridin' along
Pretty ho in the videos, thighs and a thong
A few views on YouTube, but who's buyin' the song?
WorldStar don't give a fuck how your body the verse
They'll desecrate your mixtape, so Connie can twerk
With your three-sixty deal, boy, you're probably a jerk
On Molly, while he profit off your body at work
Public Enemy told me, "Don't believe the hype"
I strive to be the type to fight to lead them right
From the brainwash, same songs daily that they playin'
And if you disagree with the mass, then you're hatin'
When did conscious rap become corny?
Why should I let the corporates defy me?
Radio suckers never play me
But that's the HI 5@9, that shit is crazy

[Verse 2: Cormega]
I feel alone in a room full of people
My body of work is food for these leeches
The Devil's a lie, illusions deceive you
We'll never find truth 'til you seek it
When you're real, they look for your weakness
When you're fake, money won't change this
They blacklisted my name in the majors
Now I'm independent, reachin' new heights, thank you
Success is in the eye of the beholder
And never worth the price your soul cost
How did something so right go so wrong?
The rules were more clear when I sold raw
Taught not to sleep, but I dozed off
And woke up with dough gone, it's my own fault
I should have known better, he showed flaws
He had something up his sleeve and his nose, uh

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Came up in the game as a young buck
Put the crack down, put the guns up
Uh, funny I ain't even want much
When your money funny, then the fun's up
Sign a deal with your funds up
In the lab 'til the sun's up
'Til the label give you thumbs up
Put the ones up, dumb it down, turn the drums up
But that ain't where you come from
Our role-model sold bottles
Fuck (?), nigga livin' like it's no tomorrow
These rappers don't own shit, they Borrow
Frontin' with a mortgage and car note
Promote lust over substance
Grown man in a dress lookin' suspect
Uh, shawty used to want a rough neck
Thug nigga like baby, where the love at?

[Verse 4: Sadat X]
Now, this industry'll smash you
Go right past you
What's good today, my nigga?
How you gon' live when it's only gettin' bigger?
And the rage it bring out that nigga
But you tame that
Fall back if you got two-syndrome
Cause there is a way to get income
You work well with people, you're social
You're up on technology, the change in ecology
You can't lose quality cause then you're gone
Now, it's fuck the industry and all that misery
Don't bring that to me, my situation growin'
I'm  still here, I found a way to keep it goin'
When you hit the continents enough
You know where bread  at
And you know where you're dead at
Understand that, you can paint the picture
But you've got to have something with you
And an image that finish you

[Verse 5: Lord Jamar]
They got you livin' like a fuckin' trick
Suckin' on the devil's dick
Stuck at the level of a bitch
While those pimps get rich
Kept in tight situations like tight clothes
The cold night froze all assets
LPs and cassettes, CDs and MP3s
Three bank accounts seized
All because them pimps wasn't pleased
Hit you with small amounts, no more than 5 G's
Knowing damn well you can't survive without cheese
Coming live and direct from the den of thieves
Where niggas die for respect like the Genovese crime families
It's time we start studying degrees
Take apart all the fallacies
Pimp slapped by reality
Solicitation of my Nation for a salary
Conversation travels through the galaxies
Like shooting stars, introducing Lord Jamar
The Black Man is Allah, understand who you are![Lord Jamar]
I be the All Eye Seeing, Supreme Being
Black Man, the colored man is the European
Ran up to his cave, he was fleeing
Over hot sand, steal from me and I chop hands
Off, that's Islamic law
The sight alone'll make you wanna vomit on the floor
I study 120, the Qur'an and the Bible
Doing my job, the God got plenty disciples
Taking my rightful place, amongst kings and queens
85's wanna know what things mean
Sweep the devil off the earth, like spring clean
My earth's rock 3/4's, never bring jeans
G-O-D, take a little look through my P-O-V
You see I be O.G., turn a devil into John D-O-E
That mean D-O-A, it's gon' be OK

[Hook 2X: Lord Jamar]
I be the Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
Here to drop bombs on the mentally dead
Islam'll, keep you properly fed
And to the four devils, yo, I'm choppin' yo head

"Well how you be God?"

[Lord Jamar]
I be all wise and civilized
Deliver truth while the 10 percent deliver lies
His devilishment, has been solidified
I be the Five Percent, opitimized
When you in the presence of God, you better recognize
Before your life gets jeopardized
I'm bout to exercise my right to bare arms
See me in a wife beater, nothing but bare arms and tattoos
I hit a muthafucka hard like bad news
Some people say I'm nuts like cashews, and that's true
I mash through in a black truck, strapped up
Busting from the driver's side, you either ride or die
All praise due to the Most High
I blaze you with my four-five
This is Jihad music, see the God do it
Allah U Akbar, Lord Jamar's the truest

[Hook 2X][Intro]

[Verse 1]
Somebody mad at my hashtag
Instagram black man looking half a fag
With the blazer and dress
I'm just amazed at the mess
Pioneer of this queer shit is Kanye West
He introduced the skinny jeans to the rap scene
Then he wore a fucking skirt on a video screen
Then he wore it again at a memorial
I can't pretend that this shit ain't deplorable
I bet this nigga think he looking adorable
Your music good, but your ego is horrible
Now these other niggas wanna follow suit
I tell the truth
Talk shit, you'll be swallowin a tooth
Duckin hollows in the booth
Wishing that you showed the respect to an OG you followed as a youth
I rebuke all this gay shit, some are scared to say shit
You might lay and take this, but I'm not to be played with

[Hook]
Lift up your skirt, lift up your skirt
Lift up your skirt, yeah, kid, lift up your skirt
Is it pussy or balls? I give a fuck if you ball
These fuck niggas wanna make suckers of us all

[Outro]Keith Murray, UGK and oh my Lord Jamar

Intro/Chorus: Lord Jamar

The east to the west
Up north to the down south
Live wires connect
So if you swangin on thangs
(Keith Murray, UGK and oh my Lord Jamar)
Or down to gangbang, or waitin on the train
It's still the same thang
*repeat*

[Bun B]
You cut your mind and your body with the rhyme and the shotty
Go and find me or hidin, with wine and Bacardi
Get down like John Gotti then I gotta get lost
I'm gone in the wind
My momma keep on tellin me there's Bun in the sin
I guess I'm hell-bound destined
To learn my lesson, sess in my chestin
It burn but I keep on puffin, no bluffin
They don't call me Big Bun for nothin
Now soundbwoy you gon' dead, well put em to rest
Bumba clot a gon' dead, wit two in his chest
Batty bwoy you gon' dead, and if he no die
We gon' come at him again! Well go on buddy let em fly
That's how it is in my city, and your city
Sir it gets no pretti-er just more gritty
Per capita, all around
]From the five boroughs on down to the mighty Bro town

Chorus

[Lord Jamar]
Now watch this current rock it current for a sentence
For a triple homicide, cripple any drama that reside in the mind
Of those livin outside of my stateline
Let em know we all the same kind
With the same crimes, catchin the same time, which translates to hang time
Organised gangs slangin dime
Lord Jamar is black G-zuz, I sees this
Everywhere I go, brothers hustlin to make the doe
Fast or slow, ya wanna see your cash grow
Like grass, but meanwhile take a blast of the el
And let the smell resonate, never hesitate
When it comes to puttin food on your plate
Devise schemes by all means
Like a sunrise when it beams, keep your eyes on the CREAM
Live Wires on the team Connect, get respect for they realness
I know you feel this

Chorus

[??????]
Uhh, now who that tryin ta claim they be thumpin
That's only when your funky little fake tape be bumpin
You can catch a square and get done unfair
Because aah, I'll be there, I'll be right there
Cocoa butter, got that, make em all for
Real life hustler movie maker, I know how y'all feel
But long as I'm alive I'mma do the right thing
And block out this stress my past criminal life might bring
The only way I use to nip it in the bud
Was ta try and put some bullets in some of you joker's guts
I got victims, G it ain't about the face you make
It's all about the place you take between yourself and snakes
Now everybody open up your arms for the cocoa-
Mr.Former Football Player-ex drug dealer-gold digger-
Killer with scrilla, they be missin me with the bomb breakin
Cos I gets busy like no cornwheat

Chorus

[Pimp C]
I'm tryin ta stack paper, these pigs can't stand me
It's all about my family, it's all about my candy
It's all about the crush, all about the feelin good
All about the rush, all about us, the first family
Somethin that a young fool never really planned to be
But funny situations, do bring change
And young fools do out here in this wicked game
That's how I'm gon' starve when fools eatin steak
Man, I can't stop now, too much money out here to make
Now you could turn your nose up and you can suck your teeth
But I gotta get this money, ain't nobody gonna get it for me
And I might have to do shady things
Stick up kid all out, no shame
Run your rings, ear ring in change
Don't make me give it to ya cos it ain't no thang
I do it for the glory man, cuff the thangs
I gotta let em hang, I'm stuck in '87 tryin to regain my brain
Too many undercovers know my name
A phone line like fire cos I'm a live wire

Chorus

[Keith Murray]
Who is this with malicious onslaughts?
Keith Murray, UGK and oh my Lord Jamar
And we bustin on all you losers
Ridin twenty-deep in two black Land Cruisers
Recognise or get paralysed with the drum
Where I'm from they promise you a fair one, then blast you with the gun
And everybody standin around like it's funny
Junior L.O.D pickin your pockets for your money
The checkered, I slide off and make a funky record about it
No more than four minutes and some seconds
And live wire connected, from my peoples on the street who respect it
And the jeeps, hoopties, Benz and Lexus
My squad stretches from New York to Portland to Texas
Let's see who's next to test this
Some herbs, ready to get their heads served
To the hard curb......

[ Zev Love X ]
Born again, a soul bend blends
K.M.D. and Brand Nubian, friends
X-tends to grip palm and causin calm in
His knowledge of self, so commence to bombin
As alarmin as a beep from your beeper
What you needed was a wake-up call to the sun, you sleeper
You don't wants get woke by the wolf, does ya?
(Naaah...) Good guessin
Switch the pitch up, another session
From the infamous God Squad
You see, we's all peas in the same pod, god
-od after 7, my attribute is -even
My tolerance is gone and my word is bond
You see the Nitwits knockin
Preach, "the Lord'll change your life around"
I figure I just saw Jamar the other day uptown
Give him a pound, it's no puzzle, they musta
Been guzzlin that 85 proof, ask Busta

[ Busta Rhymes ]
Question number one, how can you go wrong?
K.M.D., can I sing this song? (Sho' nuff)
The nitty gritty, do the nitty gritty
Get on down and let's do the nitty gritty
Busta Rhymes from the top of Chill City
Flippin on the rhythm, showin you that I get busy
Stand up for the right of the young and the witty
Movin inconspicuous like a baby kitty
Moved to the Island and I left the urban city
Whylin in the Island till I find a young bitty
Baby doll, well, I never ever fall
Hard, let the God Squad in the dancehall
K.M.D., Brand Nubian
Leaders Of The New School always be chillin
Hold up, so I can get illy
First to interfer here and I'm comin back silly
Now I feel the vibes of the choco in the Philly
You know you can't fuck because we rippin it, Smitty
I know you love this song ( ? ) to the break of dawn
Onyx, god, tell me what is going on?

[ Onyx the Birthstone Kid ]
What, what goes? As far as I know, see, bros
Are havin trouble knowin who's friends and who's foes
The worst devil is a black devil
Because you come disguised as a wolf in sheep's clothes
Like Preacher Porkchop who keeps the church clappin
Mo' comes the money, mo' money got him yappin
He sucks your bucks, so his pockets fatten
He's got some guts, he pimp-struts up to Staten
Island, I be chillin in Long Island, Long Beach
Hippin gods to they culture with the strong speech
I build with the Nubians I chill with
I fill with my zig-zag-zig
I never lived big, I never lived large, I never lived fat
The devil man in this land, he won't allow that
So brother man, I don't wanna bust you
But if you don't know the devil, gee, I can't trust you

[ Onyx ]
Knowmsayin, man
You just can't brothers who don't know what time it is
[ Zev Love X ]
True indeed, true indeed, yo
So Lord J
[ Lord Jamar ]
Yo, that's true indeed
And I know the time of the day
Lord Jamar goes like this

[ Lord Jamar ]
Life's hardships
Stones are placed and one must face trips
Falls and spills to kills and cause mishaps
These are some of his traps
But I got a jewel that needs no gift wrap
So just receive, believe when shown the light
The devil gets left, the gods gotta get right
To the source of our loss, stop wearin the cross
Do for self, kill that "Yes, sir, boss," and
When you do, from the other you won't beg
Can't you see my brother, you're the Arma-Legga-Leg
Arm, supreme Head, and instead
Of relyin, why don't you start tryin?
You say try is to fail, I say try is an attempt
Cause when you stop tryin that makes victory exempt
From your cipher, the life you lead is not hype
The blackman was not born to be a gutter snipe
Or an alley cat, you should be steppin to the rally fat
Not just with dough, but with the knowledge you know
So, get up and go, get yourself a book of
Life instead of living life like a hooker

Get some knowledge of self and do for self
Yo man, brothers ain't tryin to check it out
... you know what I'm sayin?
Crack, crack them skulls, man

[ Subroc ]
I see some so crazy deaths
Men, from head to toe they're full of lead
I flipped a brick, nah, I build a fort instead
So I taught children 'fore I flipped
Cause in actuality my man's mentality was stripped
I dipped back to the roots, I am a king with ranks
Cream in the coffee, clay thing - no thanks
Why play the role like all silly teens?
I'm the black bowling ball knockin pins to smithereens
Each teach in every town, relate that
The God Squad is like Homey the Clown, we don't play that
Coon, jiggaboo, Uncle Toms in the mix
Give me a (woof!) in reverse, Psalms 82 and 6
"All gods, and children of the Most High"
Cave-guys still fry in the sun, don't deny
I got a third eye sight vibe that don't lie
I am the lion, goodnight, defyin evil's the bull's eye

[ Sadat X ]
It's like this... (and my word is bond)
This is a modern type of style, look at what I did
A devil still can't build a pyramid
I dug a tunnel to Asia, wrote a speech with a laser
Rush your brain with a new genetic strain
The god in god's clothing, and the devil's loathing
Got enemies, but I really don't give a damn
I smacked a man cause he tried to serve a plate of ham
Disguised in a patty, my uncle Trevor's natty dread
He got a ( ? ), used to be a foot fet'
The city ( ? ) and I forgot to mention
That I'm the word buff, yes, enough is enough
Zig-zag-zig, watch the blackman get big and burst
The blackman is first
I drive a black hearse and I bury all the devils
With K.M.D. I can raise up my levels

All the brothers from Brooklyn, will you raise your hand, thank you...
All the brothers from Manhattan, will you raise your hand (uh, uh)
All the brothers from the Bronx, will you raise your hand (yeah, a Universal fam)
All the brothers from Queens, will you raise your hand (oh.. NGE)
All the brothers from Staten Island, will you raise your hand (uh, ok)
All the brothers from Westchester, will you raise your hand

[Lord Jamar]
Yo, check me out, General Monk-Monk style
Run devils across the desert, two thousand, 200 miles
And make 'em walk every step of the way
Strip 'em down, take everything away
Send 'em to the mountaneous caves
Two thousand years of lonely stage
Musa slept in the ring of fire
Bringing knowledge of how to steal & be a liar
He tried to be a civilizer, thirty three & one third degrees
Wiser, we taught him how to build a home
And how to live a respectable life
And how to master the original man
Which was the plan of the father as a boy
Now six years old, playing with steel
He saw opposites attract and that everything's real
And if you put your mind to it, by the force of your will
The thoughts manifest to be able to kill
I'm just glad we to the point, that we able to build
If we could only stay able, maybe we will

[Hook 2X: Lord Jamar]
Original man is first
I wanna say peace to the Gods & the Earths
My universal fam, living out the universal plan
Aiyo, tell 'em who I am (G-O-D)

[Raekwon]
We at the mosque prayin', nickel bags of black
Foto stacks, it's ganja season
Yeah, now, what up, my dude 'lax
Yo, blowin' coffins, keep bagging
We gon' show the government it ain't about blacks
It's only bout stacks
Furnish labs, ballin' crabs, Houston Oiler mask
Reeboks, tennis yellow, fellow goin' mad
The game is stupid, these teams, they keep sneechin' yo
What's the reason? Too much pussy, to get records to rag, yo
I'm one of the rap's boldest, fold-smith
Paper cut in my hand, I got eleven fingerprints, hold that
Back to the filty ugly, Bugsy, rugby thugs
With no love, slugs, silver ones throw these
Split niggas temples, forget, the shit's freshly squeezed
Roll that Nestle, the vet's seen in rentals
Fly language, lick the sawed-off and spray you
Aiyo, Allah is one, I'm done, no playin', nigga

[Hook 2X]

[Lord Jamar]
Yes, last Sunday of the month, so to Harlem we went
No clubbin', for parliments and Harriett Tubman
Peace to the Gods, peace to the Earths
Peace to the Seeds, peace to the Birth
Of the Nation of the Five Percent, rap sent
Intelligent brothers, to represent
Allah Justice made the knowledge born
You find the Gods from the jails to the colledge dorms
You got to 'know the ledge' to 'wise the dom'
And understand your culture of freedom
Power Equaly with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher, uh
All your life, you must teach truth
Of the true and living God not a mystery spook
And when you do that, persue that goal
Which made the student enroll
And only then you'll prosper

[Hook 2X]

[Kasim Allah]
I am he who, wrote the Bible and Quran
Who has walked on this planet from Knowledge to Born
Led in the right direction easily I
Offer jewels to those in need of protection
Use mathematics to gain answers to questions
King Kasim God Allah, show forth and prove sun, moon and stars
Raised from the dead by science into the knowledge of God
And now I know what civilization means
And I strive to teach that to these cats
But it seems that, they got a pin stuck in they head or something
Walking around but they're mentally dead
They ask for jewels and I give 'em bread
But some digest that food for thought that they were fed
My wisdom bears fruit Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head
Supreme Being Blackman, the Dred
I... shared equality with Jamar
Eyes red, bloodfire y'all! All hail the Ghetto Messiah
Truth bringer in the midst of these snakes
I... make Knowledge Born going through whatever it takes
Whether I build or destroy, I can cause earthquakes
Adding on to the positive, shining light
As this earth rotates and rotates and rotates
