[Intro: Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky Madoff everything I deserve
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked

[Verse 3: Stalley]
I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle

[Bridge: Wale] x2
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

[Verse 4: Wale]
There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas -- lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

[Verse 5: Meek Mill]
I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a billion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, we'll hurt you
Life in the power circle

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
It's too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga
Ugh!Maybach music..

[Hook]
Ball
Chevy swerving,cutting through the lane Kyrie Irving. Watch a young nigga ball
All these haters like the 85 celtic vs lakers. Watch a young nigga ball
Jumping off the porches with a forty five on me
Michal Jordan watch a young nigga, watch a young nigga


Elevate the motherfucking game

Ball
Chevy swerving,cutting through the lane Kyrie Irving. Watch a young nigga ball
All these haters like the 85 Celtic vs Lakers. Watch a young nigga ball
Jumping off the porches with a forty five on me
Michal Jordan watch a young nigga, watch a young nigga



[Verse 1:Stalley]

Old school, new school need to learn the same rules
Receive the same jewels, Eat the same food
I was the dude who practiced, with his back to the basket
So I could be magic. hook shot tragic
Converse is classic, anywhere in the key you shot, I'll match it
That's basic ball, I’m on the block like am eight feet tall
....  streets embrace us all
With all our thousand flaws, get the crowd involved
Click ....
Youngin with the flash, Chris Paul with the pass
John Wall in the mess
Grab a nigga blind. throw a shine with the bag
A wizard with cash. Turn with ten to a hundred racks. Check the stats
Big O with a big cats, got the O on my bare back
Obstacles I clear that. The Chevy rap i steer that
MVP. speeding 500HB sitting tall. watch a young nigga


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Stalley]

A Cavalier since Larry Nance and Mark Price
I’m from the city where you playing ball or ducking vice
We Lion-hearted  with tiger strips we scared with evil
Learn to shoot the desert E's before shooting free throw
The dope boys and Michal Jordan was the real Hero
They had D on the block like Ben Wallace
Making A-Rod paper, running base big pockets
Loud on the corners. turn the city back notches
Paper tags on the V. Yellow gold watches
We love the Hustle. Eleven rings Bill Russell
Two on the middle finger politely say bumpy
Bad boy demeanor fluke ain't fever. I am ......
I am ruthy on the last play
In the milk like syrup with cookies in the ash tray
Grindin to my last day. Going long like Peyton on 4th and long
Everybody sing along. watch a young nigga

[Hook][Meek Mill]
One thing's for sure, two things for certain
Got booked with three bricks, you back home, niggas working
Clown ass niggas, should have put you in the circus
Home of Philly if you get a benz, niggas lurking
Churches, hearses, is it really worth it
If you heard he telling why you dapping and conversing
Lock me in the cell, let me strap on my Converses
Before I drop a dime, tell them people a line
Swear to God, man I was nineteen I caught my first case
Nine co-defendants and snitching wasn’t the worst case
Had a hard time giving my name and my birth date
But nowadays, niggas go to jail and it’s a earthquake
They get all shook up, write a whole book up
Ratting their connect out, telling where they got the hook up
Got a niggas twenty years talking about that cook up
Back to the home, niggas fucking with him, good luck
Twelve shots of henny to the face, got me stood up
Any situation asked about me, and I stood up
Catch you slipping like a transmission, fuck your hood up
From my hood, to who your hood, good, what up
Ugh, nothing though my hunnit high
This Mac will leave a nigga look like Spongebob

[Verse 2]
I said all I know is Flex, shitting on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick em down like next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell, no jet
Waves on them 360s make that pussy get so wet
She say I'm cocky, I say that’s not me
She call me papi and I say ven aqui
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche Box like Ali
My sneaks they Bally, in my Hood I'm probably
Just rolling round in that Ghost, watching out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you merked
I put that on your head nigga, first week and you dead nigga
I bottle pop, I model pop
Catch me on them bikes, let the throttle pop
Niggas know I'm nice, and I got a lot
Like F your corner, nigga, I’ll buy the block
It’s Maybach, we way back
Yeah I was starving, this the Payback
It's off the top..
I got my hustle from Hova and my stunting from Baby
That’s why I'm fucking 'em over and my new watch cost me eighty
Got a couple of Rovers, had a drop one Mercedes
I know these suckers don’t like me, I'm probably popping they lady
I got 100 racks on me now
No computer but I got a Mac on me now
And I'm a shooter and I really clap homie now
And fuck the jail cause my nigga Ross hold me down
I'm skipping bail and we in this bitch, fresh out the Dealership
I just came in the game but I'm killing shit
My nigga wale...
We in the building
We in the building...

[Meek Mill]
I had a dream like Martin Luther
I was in the Phantom getting brain like a Harvard student
Check my record for the fame, ain't really hard to prove it
Went to jail, came home to that kitchen just like Martha Stewart
With a Pyrex trying to make a nine stretch
Just was in the yard with lifers, working on my biceps
You would think they all was like us, they ain't have my mindset
When I was missing sleep and working weeks to get my mind set
And to get my son right so he don't live my young life
Cause I remember some nights I used to hold that gun tight
Middle of the jungle trying to make it to the sunlight
Stillmatic with that pen and pad just give me one mic
And I'm going get richer, they gone get sicker
Why they mad at me, cause they ain't in the picture
Cause they was on some bullshit when they starting flicking
And the camera starting flashing, niggas came up missing

[Stalley]
Black chevelle on them blades, boy
Dark shades, leather jacket like I'm Blade, boy
Come through a city like what’s the focus boy?
I come though like open doors
Six by nines through theses door panels, make a bunch of noise
I’m mobbing on these back streets and city blocks
Middle finger every cop
Chevy block engines, everything is heavy stop
Sweat pants, the car dance, I make that bitch do the wop
I'm losing my religion
Got these angels on my shoulders and they telling me to listen
I blast this alpine and get lost in my system
They telling it's devil music and demons have imprisoned
My mind, body and soul and I’m traveling down hell's road
This strap got no Velcro
So I’m down for whatever, whenever, wherever
Any way the hell I go, you think I’m scared and here’s your answer
Hell no

[Meek Mill]
Every night I’m on the road, trying to get how it come
Still finding time just to kick it with my son
I know niggas see them bribes and its looking like it's fun
But when you out to get that cake, you gotta pick every crumb
Yeah, you gotta pick every crumb
I never thought that I see that day that I get up out the slums
Did it for my team, put them on some ones
And every day we shitting on them, we them niggas with some runs
I was outta control, block was hot as a stove
I was out with them Os, same time the block was patrol[Intro: Rick Ross]
God forgives, He's so honorable
But living amongst thieves and niggas like myself
You will not have that luxury

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I wake up excited, I made it through the night
Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?
My nerves should be a wreck, I got a bad chick
She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs
I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fucking feature
I do at least three a week, roll up the fucking reefer
Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas
Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer
Niggas claim that they thugging when they dick-riding
My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbing
On the block in my all white sneakers
Lord knows in my ten Jesus pieces
Pray for me cause you know a nigga doing wrong
My homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem
Count mills for the times that we had it hard
Asking for a hundred mill as I pray to God

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Young nigga coming up, they wanna gun you down
Drinking vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you P-Nut)
Riding real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga)
Shopping for them Os when the mall close
Repping for your homies when they all gone
Get empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit)
All black tees, ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowing on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right)
Forty dollar tab meaning forty grand
Lil Wodie got it rolled up in a rubber band
Holding on the forty in his other hand
Ten chains on, smoking in the motherland

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice
All these jewels on, all Moissanites
I could see it in the sparkle cause it lackluster
Black card maxed out, damn black brother
White collar, black market
Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket
Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta
Screaming your affiliations, but that don't matter
I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail a motherfucking killer
On trial and they wanna execute me
It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me
True G to the core, feel my texture
A true G keeps it raw in his lecture
Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers
Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Stalley]
Versace shirt, Jesus laying on the chest
Man I swear Big did it the best, I mean
Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean
Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best
And I was so impressed that I went and got ten
Now I'm stunting on these niggas cause I couldn't back then
Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum
And I wear them all at once, I ain't trying to match them
I remember bumping Mack 10 and that deuce in the corner
Scraping up for a sandwich and a soda
Now my strength is up and I'm dangling chains off my shoulders
But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed
For the reason that I buy em
And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine
Or even put it in a rhyme
It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards
But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss

[Hook]

[Outro: Rick Ross]
We untouchable

[Outro Skits]
Xolaal sama guys, dundu ben yoon la

Yow ya ray sa bopp ba dee. Moy loolu

...

Mi historia es complicada, pero al final del dia valio la pena, porque ahora estoy trabajando con el jefe

Yo vivi en Colombia y vivi muchas cosas, me entiende?

Vi muertes...vi muertes...vi cuerpos en las calles, sangrando despues del colegio, con 12, 13 años viendo estas cosas en la calle

Y siempre queria venir para aqui otra vez, y me vine, y trabaje porque tenia otra mentalidad. Y cuando llegue aca entendi mi proposito: hacer dinero, ser rico para siempre

Dios perdona, yo no[Verse 1: Wale]
They ain't talking to us, uh
This thing is easy like a layup
Meeting at the top and ain't no people in the way of
Me and my squad, this is visual art
I just paint a few bars
Leave the frame up for Amadeus

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Yeah 'Le, this is easy like a layup
Been overtime with the grind, yeah I got my weight up
Busting through these lines like T-Suggs, time to pay up
Raven flow, sky high, yeah I'm talking way up

[Verse 3: Wale]
Hold up, say what? say what?
What's wrong with all these haters?
They lyin', they lyin'
Ndamukong I'm saying
I'm tryna put my partners on, we always gon' be first
A team of all-stars like there's diamonds on my T-shirt

[Verse 4: Stalley]
Look at all these haters' faces
Boy are they hurt
We're winning, everything earned
Nothing given to us
Repeat champions, wanna win, then you gotta go through us
Non-debatable so don't talk to us
Undefeated in bouts, so we don't talk losers

[Wale]
We talking true lyrics, boy, talk to us
Woo!
First Take, every word great
That record produce verbs, check out that wordplay!

[Outro: Wale]

I'm feelin' myself, hope you feelin' me too
God forgives and I don't, unforgettable dude
I'm ballin' my nigga, and that's word to your mama
I want you to ride, definition of honor
Honor thy brother, but murder these hoes
Always pay your taxes, never pay these hoes
Always making moves, I didn't make the rules
I'm just making ends meet with this plate of food
Went from Spaghetti-O's to a new set of Vogues
Back to square one, we still was selling those
My Tribe Called Quest, shit was nice dogg
Gucci was Q-Tip, I was Phife Dawg
On the world tours with all the wrong whores
Had the right ideas, and all the wrong stores

They say Skateboard, you racist, you only hang with white Cubans
Nonsense, that's the necklace nigga, the light's moving
This is jewelry, that shit is foolery
Frozen water on my neck nigga, who cool as me?
Up in mansion like the black Kurt Cobain
My nigga Ross said he's the boss, cause he works cocaine
And under no certain circumstances
Will the facets of the diamonds not be disrespectful and hurt your chain
And your feelings, yeah they villains but I'm chillin, I'm still a N.E.R.D
Millions and millions and millions off of verbs
Well my niggas be stealin and killin and thrillin for the birds
Making deals, squeezing the life out of them Nextel chirps
I'm on my iPhone (Uhh)
Bitches put their naked pictures on my iPad, the doors go up and iGone
Black boy scoring his life, I'm scoring the Oscars (I'm really am, nigga)
Remember I used to want a Pasha and eat some lobster
But now I eat the apple with my A-P
Your life and your wrist got the wrong timing, you hate me

Uhh, dedication to motivation, gave 'em motives to hate me
Old homies betrayed me, running around saying they made me
But when I had a quarter, they had, four and the baby
It was a whole different story, but fuck them niggas is shady
Now I'm self-made, self-paid, and I give myself a raise
Whole circle shining nigga, never had no selfish ways
Never had nobody tell me 'go and get it' tell me 'save'
Had to learn on my own, ask my Mama I was gone
Puffin purple getting stoned, trying to take the pain away
Now its Rolls Royces, umbrellas for a rainy day
Old heads told me "young fella, this ain't the game to play!"
Had to take the chance, told the dealer, "deal my hand"
And now that nigga's getting murdered, shit is getting scary
I put mirror tint all in the ghost, I'm screaming Bloody Mary! nigga
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
Let 'em cross the line of scrimmage, they get fucking buried
They had me cutting through that field just like a rushing Barry
Slammers play with hammers, had them birds but we don't fuck with Larry
I was just trying to ball, ducking D's and grinding raw
But now I pull up in that thing, them niggas gon' need some Tylenol
I'm gone!

I'm staring at my notepad like goodbye to my broke past
Words full of money, use dollar signs as my periods
I'm gettin money - period!
They said I got a old soul and I'm rich nigga spirited
So one time for the old-timers and two for the new school
Three for my geechie niggas with big rollies in that new coupe
Blowing on loud, sippin on that dirty juice
With a tre duece livin life like they ain't made loot
Cuz whats here today could be gone tomorrow so I'mma get it myself
I ain't known to ball, make sure my kids is straight in case I'm gone tomorrow
Young Bonaparte, I'm noble dog like Drew Ali
Dark shades like Kool Moe Dee, cool fly nigga is who I be
Big chain with a bigger charm, leave with a bad chick under my arm

Fountain of youth
May our legacies live forever
Hunh

[Rick Ross]
All my niggas quiet but we burning loud
Makaveli to the max: never turn it down
Mac 11 in a Benz: how you like me now?
I run the city so my closet look like Nike Town
Niggas talking like bitches -- is it my income?
Am I fucking your bitches? Is it official?
My nigga did a dime, didn't learn a thing from it
Came home, in two weeks got him a 600
Get a text from the boss: you know them bricks coming
Chicks at the beach house like they gonna miss something
From the churches I rose, only loving the dough
From the Chevy to Rolls, now it's fur on the floor
Smoke an ounce of the truth: that's my fountain of youth
R.I.P. to Mr. Shakur, this one is for you
Nippsey Hussle and I got my nigga Stalley on it
Double MG burning out in Cali on it

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental
Keys got me sentimental

[Verse 2: Stalley]
These rap books buried in gold
The treasure of a million men, Versace shades trimmed in gold
My life's big like them cameras explode
Capture this rags to riches story that I unfold
The youth fountain for the few counting
Made money, but who's counting?
It's hard stunting living in subsidized housing
Every bag you bring though the door, dude's counting
And every new girl you bring through, dude's hounding
They want your youth, so they watch your moves
From your pinky ring, down to how you lace your shoes
Rope chains with the precious jewels
The dope game had impression rules
What they did with cocaine and a couple spoons
Had the whole hood acting like goons
Trying to be the richest, trying to the be flyest
Claim to be balling, end up like Len Bias
Screaming from the bottom of this fountain here, nothing but silence

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Laces in my blue Chucks, represent my bros first
Staring at my Rollie bezel as I soul-search
Run this money marathon til my soles hurt
But no materials could measure what my soul's worth
I wanted everything, feel like I had no choice
Young niggas wishing on a star like Rose Royce
Being honest, killing mamas when we sold work
I made a promise, give me options and I cold-turkey
Sick of sitting on the side while it's game point
Recurring dream, tryna scream but ain't had no voice
Crazy lady speaking tongues said it's gon' work
Never vocalize my visions, actions was my spokesperson
Study rich niggas' moves like my homework
Sacrilegious; however, streets was my own church

[Hook][Chanting]
Obie, Obie, Obie...

[Talking]
State of Ohio, man, this is it, this is the mecca right here
Yeah I live in Massillon. Proud about it, you know?
Somebody say oh, I'm fro- I'm from New York
So I'm from Massillon

3, 3, 0
3, 3, 0
3, 3, 0
Here we- Here we go
3, 3, 0

[Verse 1]
Call my city out they coming with me
And we gon' dog this bitch and split it up 50-50
Scout's honor, I'm a bomber unified
No fingers crossed, no hands tied
I'm bout to knock these weak niggas off the earth
Got em' by a landslide
No tear shed, cut them feelings off, it's ok to be
Proud how I rep for y'all, salute, pause, cock back, and let the weapons off
For a rebel with an f-ing cause I set bars for rappers out that cold
So please step it up
Not a man on the moon, this ground I step on be where this classic nigga groom
I bloom from the cracks then get it movin from them corners with them gats
Had gasoline dreams, and still lit a match
Chevy with the hats, Jordan fitted the only thing that match
Midwest, yep
Yee ain't know, I be the supreme, throw them up
And flagrant niggas giving away too many free throws
I'm already up, scoreboard shows, winner
Swoosh

[Chorus]
(330)
What I rep to the death of me
And when you see me, its gon' always be
(330)
Where I came from, out that dirt
And got my game from
(330)
What I rep to the death of me
And when you see me, its gon' always be
(330)
Where I came from, out that dirt
And got my game from

[Verse 2]
Got so much pride in them 3 numbers
Cause we be on our own ish
Furs and gators for that cold ish
Tank tops and Dickie shorts for hot summers
On 16th where the dice tumbles
Blanket special so you might wonder, if it's cool to bend these corners
It is and but it ain't, cause them youngins be upon yas
So don't get too much in comfort
Cause they always gonna wonder, what you come for, then dump you
Now let me bring it back to the peaceful side, where the pride lies heavy on me
Name a nigga that done did it like me
Took the Milq and made it famous, shooting for the top aimless
Taking out whoever ain't with the- (330)
That's on my soul, I got it jumping like it's 6'4", let's go Ohio
The representation you been waiting for
We here now, apologies if you waited long

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Got so much pride in them 3 numbers
Got so much pride in them 3 numbers
Where I came from
Got so much pride in them 3 numbers


Ohio stand up, O-o-ohio stand up[Hook]
I'm on the radio early
She actin' like she ain't heard me
You ain't know I'm the man now?
Back in the 330 (midwest models I got 'em)
Just left LA, on the red eye early
Flight end at 3:30, back in the 330 (midwest models I got 'em)
330, back in the 330 (midwest models I got 'em)
Where the niggas ride clean
And the girls so pretty
330, back in the 330 (midwest models I got 'em)
Where the niggas ride clean
And the girls so pretty

[Verse 1]
Long furs, fat blunts, t-top Monte with the bang in the trunk
Fresh off the plane with the LA stitch
I love Cali girls in the sunshine
But ain't nothing like my 330 chicks from them Akron girls that went to school with 'Bron
Private school girls who love to get down
And them ratchet girls out of Youngstown all holdin it down
And my white girls in Medina
Who's finer than they momma China
And them Massillon Canton girls who sharper than a line up
I got em' city to city I'm talking All-Star Line-up
Got a roster spot come sign up
I'm talking max deals, Balenciaga
I'm talking black heels with red bottoms
Pretty girls with the big bottoms

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
3-3-0, but it's Ohio love
Scarlet grey Chevy with my eyes on the Bucks
Move through the trap like Eddie George
Got 27 years piled up in the trunk
I'm talking FED time no jersey numbers
My cousin got knocked gave him Worthy's number
He was a mathematician out here he worked them numbers
Love to have a good time, his favorite line
Don't let the work become us and spend freely
Never live life on PG doe
And wherever you go rep that 3-3-0
So I'm shouting Milq all over this beat, you know?
I like to sit high, and my beats real low
A mid-west nigga to the feet, you know?
A BCG nigga all draped in gold
Never mind a player hater, lame trick, or ho

[Hook]

[Talking - James Pennix]
You see bro? It all worked out like we knew it would. We came a long way. I remember the day I met you. This is way before them Alife days ha- member those days? Those was some good days too though. And you came to Atlanta to visit this young lady, cousin of mine. And ya got into it the first day, so I told you roll with me. You rolled around The A, burn something, listening to some good music. And as we started to talk and vibe, I was like damn, this nigga is just like me. With the same goals going through the same shit, just in different ways. And ever since then, we done been through it all together. Performin in front of five people, but you kept pushin. And we here now. We deserve this more than anybody. You are Ohio. You are 330. Mr. Massillon. I'm proud of you boy. Let's do it

Three thirty, three thirty (oh) (x2)
Ohio (x3)87 Regal
I told her raise that glass to the air
Roll something and put that grass in the air
I can upgrade you, take that glass out your ear
Put a stone on your finger, let you shine everywhere
Take you everywhere you never been
My condo you can settle in
Your convo is just heaven sent
Im comfortable as I ever been
Can't put no number on you
I Don't know how they rate you a 10
You just really outta here
No telescope could zoom you in
So when
I seen you I had to move on in
Shoot you a lil life, a lil game and let you choose ya man
This ain't really game doe
So ain't really a lose or win
You gonna shine regardless
Wit that beautiful skin
I know I'm just one of many men
Letting these words fly thru the wind
Hoping they land on your heart
So we can depart and park this chevy in A park
Star gazing in the dark
We align these stars of the heart
Don't want these cosmos falling apart
Our universe dance to Mozart
A symphony from the Monte car

We Ride ride low, Fired up
In the streets at night
Bending round da corners wit dem beats on high
Shaking down till the stars fall from the sky

Nightly excursions we just free our mind
We got lost in the day, not keeping time
Swiss watch with sweep design
Chanel patterns, bling shine
Mikkimotto fall on my ladies polo
Relax fit like we left soho
Hit the cars switch then we bounce like pogo
Yolo
Is the only way we know doe
Stepping out the frame like a photo
New money, and your money low doe
So you can't go where we roll
We the stars of the night, but we trying to be low
Merlot and Clicquot
Chauffeured in then regal
Same year dat she born
87
We gone[Intro]
It's all good, it's already
Yeah, already understood, ain't nothin
Still the same old, that's all
Ain't nothin change, fool, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uhh, nigga for what
Get down with these suckers when I'm high as fuck
And they under us, catch a crook in ya neck
From trying to watch the jets, Mr. Tokyo Drift
Spent yen on a vet, lookin' for ya bitch fool
Take one guess she caught up in the rapture
Wakin and bakin Anita’s greatest hits blastin
Pedal mashin, paper twistin'
Scrape an engine, Rad Racer
No 3D glasses just a high ass rapper, Spitta
Nigga in the building, nah I'm on the roof chillin'
The pool up here, couple chicks I grew up with
Bottles in the cooler
If ya don't know how to do it homie I'll school ya
Barrel roll, loop de loop, top gun manuevers
Makin hot wheels outta hoopties holdin it down like balloon strings

[Hook]
It's all good ain't gotta be said, it's already understood
Ain't nothin, ain't nothin' change but the address
Fool, ain't nothin' change but the address
We still the same mode niggas switchin the script
But we still playin' the same role, and so
Ain't nothin' changed but the address fool, ain't nothin change

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Starin out the villa at the ocean miles long
Tryin' to figure out raps to put up in a song
Nights long but the day's short, Nike shorts
Argyle socks, Jordan three's, lounge gear
Long beard you can tell I ain't from round here
Obvious with the occasional glare from the natives
Call 'em back tell my mama I make it
Not complacent with the life style
Feels good but it's hard to crack a smile
When the ones you came up with not around
Roll a joint after pickin through the pound, whole perception done changed
Funny how a three hour flight can make ya life change
Tight things I be thinkin on
When I'm driftin in and out of herb clouds
Hangin on every second of the moment
So you can feel all the memories I come home with
And for those that miss me, I'll be back don't trip in the 'Maro with the shift kit
Ocean side, doors open wide tryin' not to be sea sick
Plottin in the tropics thinkin' how I'm gone run this
Back in the states when I leave

[Outro]
Yeah, SkiBeatz[Produced By Rashad of Elev8tor Music]

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
100 miles and runnin'
Always into something
Yelling fuck the police
Like I’m straight up out of Compton
Real niggas don’t die
Appetite for destruction
Just a nigga with an attitude
Always into something

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Impala on eights, dope boys on crates
Swiss movement on watch, 45 on the waist
Got a million dollar hustle, a rich nigga face
White cocaine, rack it up on the plate
Alpina Beamer with the cavalier plates
My niggas dribble down in VA on the run from the DEA
That’s when niggas wore button ups and white ups like
H O V A, and everybody had Ye before 808s & Heartbreak
The streets was a shark tank, put money in the gold link
And loyalty was everything
Your lady held you down, with or without a wedding ring
Selling dope wasn’t settling
If you could smoke it they was selling it
Hard grind peddling
A street nigga pedigree, tryna leave a kingpin legacy
Pockets fat like Ledisi, thank you to the heavenly
Father for them dollars, I got it straighter than the letter T

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Dope man, dope man, that’s what they yelling
Pockets full of stones and an automatic weapon
Teenage outlaws, rebels without cause
Lost in this jungle where everybody is flawed
Middle finger to the law, best friends lay in morgues
And they wonder why our attitude’s raw
A real nigga never take a fall, that’s on god
Or never take on the false façade
Before that happens niggas blocks getting taked off
Appetite for destruction
That’s how we all function, and we get it how we live
Even if it’s gun busting
Number crunching with 8 balls for fiends luncheon
Anything to keep from ribs touching
Rims bumping, I blame it on Cube
He says it gets funky, a subject and a predicate
F the police, that’s a gangster nigga’s etiquette
And this nine filled with cop killers that’s sitting on my hip

[Hook][Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
100 miles and runnin'
Always into something
Yelling fuck the police
Like I’m straight up out of Compton
Real niggas don’t die
Appetite for destruction
Just a nigga with an attitude
Always into something

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Stampede  on stomp, mash smash out
Cashing and taking motherfucking cash out
Hit double time switches pushing glass house
See the bitch like the garbage, take the trash out
[?] dear mama , here I come, Osama
[?] Big Snoop, [?]
Casey with the suit cases filled with llamas
In the car banging like a house party
Blowing out the speakers with the L.A. Leakers
Get fat burgers just to get a meal
And if a nigga trip I'mma shoot to kill
Ice cubes in my drank, I kill at will
Wish a nigga would cause a nigga will
Jump off with the sickle cell nickels?
Spray off  always into something dumpin', looking for a nigga
Now I got 'em

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Still got impalas on eights, coupe riding with case
Smoke a blunt with Kurupt, lettin' the chevy move bass
Got the two on the waist, Jordan eights on the pedal
Ridin' down the  [?], showin' love to the ghetto
Niggas thought i was west cause I'm on the [?] with nigga
On the town front 'em swap meet with the Compton Crips
I get love out there from the hills to the strip
But I'm a mid-west nigga, don't mistake that ish
I'm authentic to my pearly whites, never bite and shit
So all that heckling and loose talk, get tightened quick
I'm from the bloodline of hustlers, bow tie and pricks
Gentleman services, million dollar fence
Rottweilers and pits, loud bops on the corner
Every nigga did juvie before they get the diploma
Stay runnin' from cops cause they now they pop on us
Most of mothers are single and most of fathers are stoners
And we coming from nothing, so we

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Ridin round, round we go , I get around
Tryna make a dollar outta a dime right now
The illest youngin'  outta LA in a minute
Working down the 4, come home, I give it the business
If I give a fuck about a chick I be broke
Kurupt in the studio off them  moon rocks we smoke
Cops pull me over, they want my license revoked
I pull up in that Bimmer, give the young niggas hope
California weather, I swear it's so amazing
In my own city it feel like a vacation
Real west side, nigga, and I hate waiting
All we know is hustling,  gettin to the paper
They show me love every time I come around
I'm always into something, need to slow it down
I'm gettin' older now, man, I'm really growing now
Man in my city like the mayor how I roll around

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign][Intro: Rick Ross]
She self made, I'm self made
We're made for each other

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
They calling me the hottest in the game
Never the gold, I wanted gold plated chains
Have sex on a highway in the Lexus
Suck her neck before I eat her like she's breakfast
Never mind the rumors baby this is me and you
Bail hard but balling 50 on them pretty shoes
With foreign names, valet the Range
Different positions, but she still moaning the same
Millie on my neck, thumbin through that check
Rozay in effect, know how to make her wet
Roses by the dozen, everyday I'm hustling
Blowing money fast looking like I'm saving nothing
Let's take another trip, different continents we touching
Niggas getting flipped, I get them done for nothing
Shout out to Joe and Chris, It's A.P on my wrist
I'm still seeing bricks like it's still '86
Over 20 homes, but I need a chick
And she got the bomb, I'm talking tick tick
She got the bomb, I'm talking tick tick
And if you feel I'm wrong, baby you should tell me this
You can't tell me shit

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Don’t you be holding back, your love
Don’t you be holding back
Don’t you be holding back, your love
Don’t you be holding back
Cause in the end girl you’re gonna want another round, another round
Girl you’re gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you, and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I’m talking Janet, maybe Kim K, I hear Rihanna she like it kinky

[Verse 2: Wale]
Listen, uno papi chulo bout to show you what you been missing
Sex is just a weapon, I can leave you wet from this pistol
I cannot believe you think you young and tripping
Why you tryin to read me if you see there isnt any issues
Double MG, Wale she call me Olu
At a polo with no logo, and my zapatos is like 4 0's
Let's have a toast for this new love
I scoop you up at like 2 somethin'
Truthfully don't do much, but with you trying do something
Poetic genius, my home is scenic
My latest feature probly got these haters grieving
At the same time had they lady geekin'
Clearly pissed them off without no star they 1080p-in'
And my kick game beyond crazy
Clark Kent, Fat Joe, the only ones who may fade me
Ain't no better swimming in the ocean of your lady
We way beyond haters we just finished self-made 3
Ralph!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stalley]
And I'mma be honest she's the fliest here
Her shoe game is everything heels then I get 10
All the ladies bad, their dresses Kashmir
She glammed up behind that eyeliner I know there's tears
She seem a little brave, but I sense the fear
Her defense is up I'm wishing that it disappears
I'm wishing that she listens up cause this is...
... materialize her love for one who doesn't care
She say all men treat her wrong way
Yeah, I know, that's what they all say
But I get you, I bang with you the long way
And we got history, let's repeat it the right way
Another round what the song say

[Hook][Verse 1: Stalley]
Cold blooded, not a care with me
I made my own circle, not a square with me
I move through the night when the air is empty
Just waiting for the right time to tear in me
Nigga thinking that they messing with me, snipe em down
A lot of talk out here, they need to pipe it down
I'm not liking how they overlooking Stal
Like I ain't popping, I ain't cracking now
About to turn this whole ish to O.K. Corral
And anybody in front of me getting floored down
I was one piece, but I'm torn now
Was on the fence about killing, but now it's going down
And I ain't stopping til I drop every one of these clowns
No sliding, go inside when I let off these rounds
Cause when I'm squeezing ain't no leaving no niggas around
Straight killer, this how murdering classical sounds

[Hook: John Mayer]
You get in, you get done
And then you get gone
You get in, you get done
And then you get gone
You never leave a trace
Or show your face, you get gone
You get in, you get done
And then you get gone

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Nothing sloppy about the way I'm moving
Real assassin they way I pick apart what I'm shooting
They put me into overdrive
My adrenaline on ten from the fear in they eyes
Somewhere disguised like the common folk
I see through them when I align my scope
They killing they self here, you might as well tie the rope
They dying slow falling down the razor slope
Trying to be something they aren't, rather than something they know
And me I'm a killer, natural born killer
Eliminate weak rhymesayers and play killers
The day differrs, but I never let of triggers
Cause they oversatured the game with lame niggas
So the dirty job is mine, but I'mma do it with clean hands
Slouched between three trash cans and an old Sedan
Hop out, let out sixteen and burn a niggas head off
And jet off before they can ever see who let off

[Hook: John Mayer]
You get in, you get done
And then you get gone
You get in, you get done
And then you get gone
You never leave a trace
Or show your face, you get gone
You get in, you get done
And then you get gone[Intro]
Y'all niggas hurry up. Go in there, buck them niggas and get the fuck out. Don't be playin, ya hear what I'm sayin? Kill them niggas and get the fuck back so we can stay ballin', I'mma be chillin right here

[Hook]
Champagne pourin', big joint rollin'
Bombay sippin', bad bitch gettin'

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Just got the whip detailed
800 horses in the car, V-12
My girl doing her nails, don't let the polish spill
As I bend the corners, tilting down the hill cup on chill
Triple stacked up, racked up with a deal
Do what I want, man, bump how they feel
About it I'm about it nigga that's just how it is
Fast cars, gold chains that's just how I live
You don't like it, do something
Scrap and shoot somethin'
Niggas all bark, no bite, ain't gon' do nothing
Weak lames hate see a young king stunting
In my King James 100 miles and runnin'
All my niggas gettin' papers ain't nobody here for nothin'
And they all killing for me so don't let 'em get the dumpin'
For my homies dead and gone, go and spill something
Livin' for my niggas in the feds doing real numbers
Heavy rotations on the blunts ain't tryna feel nothing, zoned out
Glass house comes with the push buttons, overdrive
I'm Superfly, Ron O'Neal suit and tie
Hustler to the max, if you want it done right homie come to the wax

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Ey, homie, you need some help? (*Gunshots*) Punk ass niggas, come on niggas

[Verse 2]
A-Wax in the two seater
Bad diva pourin' a pint in a two liter
Blue flannel tan khaki's tucking two heaters
45 Desert Eagles fitted by Leaders
Blue sneakers stay fleet when I'm out
Gold in my mouth talk diamonds like a jeweler
Rings on my fingers call me Slick Rick the Ruler
Whoever don't like me middle finger to ya
Booyah, booyah I send shots straight through ya
Talents rip you apart niggas can't kill ya
Don't compare my talent to y'all, y'all niggas straight losers
I'm a bully, I'm a Boozer, couch standin' Tom Cruiser
My champagne cooler, plain Jane Muller
Blueberry Swisher sweets Mary Jane blower
Leave with any girl that I choose like I know her
Passionate 'bout my game, like Joakim Noah
I'm a bull

[Hook][Verse 1]
I felt the winter wind in my july skin
Every hair on my arm started rising
Heard the beat so I decided to dive in
It was sounding so funky in my high end
Both speaker headphones lyrics to go
Navigate you on your way home, baby let's go
Through the corridors of my cerebral
See a little action, see some Malenko
Crowded alleys from where we was letting the weed blow
Stick up kids sunk low in my Regal
Trying to find a remote local
This is time for the now, god bless a child
Thats daddy's own
Cause we was still searching trying to find our way home
Thats why each verse is more than a poem
Every word is a step deep in mind
When we babbling we traveling, we can take our time

[Hook x2]
Traveling, unravelling, rambling on
When we travel, never stopping, keeping it going on
The words are strong, my word is bond
So lets roll along in Babylon

[Verse 2]
So you can relax and settle on in
My mellow, my man, my ace, my friend
You are now rocking with a non-complacent man
So I guess we not settling
Speech so comfortable without peddling
G5 a fix, yeh no ride is better than
The one you on right now, we above light now
Out of mind is out of space, this is far out
Doom yet quite wild, this is like an amazing class trip
Mixed with a bad acid hit, stalely classic shit
As we flip through the pages of the brain
It starts seeming more insane
The things that once looked familiar
All have changed
As it all spills out, we recognise real how
It should be expressed out

[Hook x2]Maybach music..

[Hook]
Ball
Chevy swerving,cutting through the lane Kyrie Irving. Watch a young nigga ball
All these haters like the 85 celtic vs lakers. Watch a young nigga ball
Jumping off the porches with a forty five on me
Michal Jordan watch a young nigga, watch a young nigga


Elevate the motherfucking game

Ball
Chevy swerving,cutting through the lane Kyrie Irving. Watch a young nigga ball
All these haters like the 85 Celtic vs Lakers. Watch a young nigga ball
Jumping off the porches with a forty five on me
Michal Jordan watch a young nigga, watch a young nigga



[Verse 1:Stalley]

Old school, new school need to learn the same rules
Receive the same jewels, Eat the same food
I was the dude who practiced, with his back to the basket
So I could be magic. hook shot tragic
Converse is classic, anywhere in the key you shot, I'll match it
That's basic ball, I’m on the block like am eight feet tall
....  streets embrace us all
With all our thousand flaws, get the crowd involved
Click ....
Youngin with the flash, Chris Paul with the pass
John Wall in the mess
Grab a nigga blind. throw a shine with the bag
A wizard with cash. Turn with ten to a hundred racks. Check the stats
Big O with a big cats, got the O on my bare back
Obstacles I clear that. The Chevy rap i steer that
MVP. speeding 500HB sitting tall. watch a young nigga


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Stalley]

A Cavalier since Larry Nance and Mark Price
I’m from the city where you playing ball or ducking vice
We Lion-hearted  with tiger strips we scared with evil
Learn to shoot the desert E's before shooting free throw
The dope boys and Michal Jordan was the real Hero
They had D on the block like Ben Wallace
Making A-Rod paper, running base big pockets
Loud on the corners. turn the city back notches
Paper tags on the V. Yellow gold watches
We love the Hustle. Eleven rings Bill Russell
Two on the middle finger politely say bumpy
Bad boy demeanor fluke ain't fever. I am ......
I am ruthy on the last play
In the milk like syrup with cookies in the ash tray
Grindin to my last day. Going long like Peyton on 4th and long
Everybody sing along. watch a young nigga

[Hook][Verse 1]
Drag racing
Left the game behind me
I'm zooming on these niggas and I don't see nobody
There's no competition and I told you niggas I'd be
Back to put down, now I'm back with the crown
Crooked C with the pins on it
My kids life depends on it
So when the pen glowing and then I get going
I ain't tip toeing, I'm stomping
In the black boots that mob
Look at the ish they start
Made a honest man straight heartless
1 to 9 be ski mask mobbing
Someone pass me the bump blump
I got something to say boy
Real intelligent ish too, something niggas will pay for
Got filth under my nails, so I ain't tryin' to be no playboy
Or sell you nothing I ain't boy, see ain't for that dumb ish
Yeah I aim at your nugget over that rat hole and I'll plug it
Took my slick flow and I thugged it
Now these lame ass niggas they love it
I does it, for you and you
Put it together like two and two
BCGMMG, yeah that be my only crew

[Hook]
BCGMMG, yeah that be my only crew (x4)

[Verse 2]
American flag on my steering wheel
Pine tree on my rear view mirror
Everything seeming closer than what it appears
And what it appears to be
Is that everything in front of me is mine
So no time to focus on what's behind
I'm focused on mine, I'm focused on time
Rolex watch with the fragment design
Small town boy with the worldly mind
The world is mine, the world is mine
I repeat it to myself at night
This flag dangling reminds me of my earned stripes
The stars represent my eyes
The blue is for the blood flowing cold as ice
The convertible Chevy's poltergeist
And it's cocaine white and it flows so nice
It's coolest when I pull up at lights
And hop out like the grim reaper collecting lives
20 inch blades and they cut like knives
I creep up on your block, then I cut my lights
Make sure I hit everything in sight
I'm leaving no prisoners, I ain't sparing life
A savage journey for my American slice
I'm not needy, but I'm greedy and I want my pie
So I can split it then share with my guys
Then Meek shall inherit, but I'm done playing nice
Cause a good guy never own anything
But a humble life[Intro: Stalley]
I just be laughing at these haters...
My laugh is like...
My laugh sound like...

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Drag racin', left the game behind me
I'm zoomin' on these niggas and I don't see nobody
There's no competition and I told you niggas I'd be
Back to put it down, now I'm back with the crown
Crooked C with the pins on it, my kid's life depends on it
So when the pen glowin', and I get goin, I ain't tip toein', I'm stompin'
In them black boots that mob
Look at the ish they start
Made a honest man straight heartless...Once in a while I be ski mask mobbin'
Someone pass me the Mont Blanc, I got somethin' to say boy
Real intelligent ish too, somethin' niggas'll pay for
Got filth under my nails, so I ain't tryna be no playboy
Won't sell you nothin' I ain't boy, see I ain't for
That dumb ish
Yea I'll aim at ya nugget
Open that rat hole and I'll plug it
Took my slick flow and I thugged it
Now these lame ass niggas they love it, I does it
For you and you, put it together like two and two
BCGMMG, yea that be my only crew

[Hook: Stalley]
BCGMMG, yea that be my only crew
BCGMMG, yea that be my only crew
BCGMMG, yea that be my only crew
BCGMMG, yea that be my only crew

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Drag racin' haters all behind me
Niggas mad at me cause my chrome wheels shinin'
Flag hangin, bosses move in silence
The money came slow, then I started vibin'
Bumpin' Tela nigga "I'm so tired of ballin'"
My new crib got four fuckin' waterfalls in it
Behind the double doors it look like it's a mall in it
Fuck her good, bend her over, then I fall in it
Pair of Chuck Taylor's, I rarely call tennis
All the locc's sport'em, and they all menace
From a nickel rock the Louboutin's on any block
Public transportation our Lamborghini's on Rickenbacker
Still under surveillance, look over you haters
Right back to this money, I'll get with you later
I'm stackin' this money, can't do you no favors
I'm fuckin' with Stalley, we still on the pavement

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Rolex, I get more sex
Ho's tryna hang like coat check
Four's on the Rang nigga no sweat
And every time I'm in the bank that's more checks
And my nigga's got work no Bowflex, and my 44th bulldogs go fetch
Two bad hoes with me and they both wet
And I stand on the corner like I protest
Till that work done, and that first come
And when the re-up came, I was the first one
Like the Re-Up Gang I had two clips, up in my new glicc, ready to hurt something
Cops came, I ain't heard nothin'
Rock came, I served somethin'
Started off with that .oz and tried to flip that bitch to a whole ki'
I'm OG, you know me
Your work high, I'm low key
I started off with like four quarters and it was tie game, I went OT
Your girlfriend she so freak, eat the dick till she OD
Gotta yellow Rollie, with a yellow bezel, and them rocks in it like cold pink

[Hook][Wale]
Off rip, I'm a double M-G nigga
Running this shit bet you lil' niggas flea-flicker
Windows down, letting bitches snicker
Got cheap bitches, got cheap liquor
Dropping C-notes on strippers at the casino
I'm making movies: them Kill Bill's and Tarantino's
Lyrically Aristotle, lyrically can't see it
Them bammas can't see the bars, y'all some paralegals
I smoke sweets in the suite, like this shit is legal
Cover the building in green my nigga: Fred Segal
Ha, okay that 90210 talk
Bitches talk to me, and they send you niggas postcards
What you think I flow for? Y'all niggas is old dog
Y'all over the hill like you tryna race a soapbox
And even if I'm broke, dog
I'd rather have no job than no heart
Wale!

[Pill]
Flow retarded, I need to wipe the slob after every bar
Wreck beats daily, have 'em looking like Halle Berry car
Accidents happen when I got the Mac in hand
Mic defibrillator give haters heart attacks in advance
It's M-O-E, so all I need is more chips
Swag stand out like pimples and cold-sore lips
Ugh! Pill hotter than a snotty nose
Body doze, who not exposed, give em karate blows
Liu Kang the way I kick it, bumping Wu Tang
Try to protect the neck, I ? from ya boo thang
Parking lot of the blue flame, flows hotter than butane
If you lame, the only way you hang is like Hussein
See, there's a war going on and I'm the general
And I'mma speak it directly at ya: no subliminals
See, all my life I was raised by a lot of criminals
So all I know is scratching my pistols and my genitals

[Stalley]
Picture this: picking kicks out of Foot Locker
Thinking how I could rid evil and let the good conquer
I'm mixing mad emotions, you know the hood'll haunt ya
Driving you bonkers, eating roaches, yeah: just look at Yonkers
Most of them ain't conscious, they just monsters, tryna be some mobsters
They call me conscious, and I think I'm better
Cause I'll be honest
I ain't tryna be a victim of the projects or a uniformed man
I'm tryna uniform 10 million men
Unify them, mob through, take over and
Maybe I'm beyond myself, maybe these are my thoughts
Should I die by myself insubordinate?
I start a revolution by myself, niggas better call for help
Til there's no telling whose side are you on?
Pick one or move on, a war going on outside no one is safe from

[Meek Mill]
Self-made, 60K the first week
I signed with Maybach, and we did that ish the 1st week
Before this rapping, I was trappin', getting work cheap
Now it'll cost you 30 racks to get a verse cheap
Sheesh! I'm like R.I.P
I dropped 2Pac Back and did it B.I.G
America's most wanted like Chi Ali
I'm too young to be doing this, they need to see ID
Ross said I'm hot, Tip said I'm hot, Swizz said I'm hot
Your chick said I'm hot
I went and bought a whip for some chicks and a drop
Now my watch fruity colors like Trix in a box
The money ain't running, it's standing still now
I'm getting it, hustlin' like I'm still down
Suckas is talking like I ain't still around
They can't deal with me, I got a deal now
Big face hundreds, big face Rollies
I be throwing deuces, suckers they don't know me
MMG the team, and I think I'm Kobe
I'm ridin' on that thing with 20's like Ginobli
G-5 sitting on the runway
Just to go to LIV on a Sunday
I spend it make it right back on a Monday
All my niggas rolling, and we bout that gun play
Meek Milly
MMG

[Rick Ross]
If you don't know, Maybach is the clique
I'm screaming "Maybach!" til I'm rich
All the chicks see the money, clothes never bummy
Satin to the silks, I'm icy when it's sunny
Look around: we the largest in the game
All them other boys targets and I'm flawless with the aim
Hit your block with a Glock, blog that
North Philly, Meek Milly - where my dogs at
DC, Wale - nice ball cap
New golds Rolls Royce, yeah I'm all that
Couple milli in the bag and my face good
Buy a chick a new pad when she taste good
10 chains, hustle hard: Ace Hood
Smoke ? you know it taste good
Scoop pills, 5 G's on a phone bill
Sunlife Stadium, smoke on my home field
MMG man, we smoked out[Hook: Rick Ross] (x2)
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Tear gas all through the night
Niggas thuggin' out in Ferguson so get it right

[Verse 1: Stalley]
The streets ruthless, the coupe roofless, the nine is near
The new niggas get fools, man, this time of year
My palms itchin', the money clickin', my time is here
Whatever you lookin' for, I'm sure you can find it here
I rose from the ashes, sleepin' on pissy mattress
Niggas was cuttin' classes, ridin' Cutlass Classics
The streets we mastered, in BAs and AKs
Ain't make it to the NBA but we ball like everyday, aye
Word to Trayvon and Mike Brown
Them pigs'll gun you down and call it standin' they ground
The situation wack, we need a moment of silence
Or violence, I'm only being honest
Don't condone it but fuck it, we ridin'
Ain't goin' down without a fight
Middle finger up if they ever try and read me my rights
Hangin' out the window screaming "F the police"
Damn right, a nigga black but he sellin' white

[Hook 2: Rick Ross] (x2)
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sitting in the Benz and it's white on white

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I can remember my daddy and even daddy's pappy
Hidin' bricks of the shit up in my granny's attic
My uncle stole out the package and daddy beat him savage
And though he beat him, I could tell it was love in the lashes
He looked me deep in my eyes, past the tears and the lashes
Told me, "Son, never become a victim of habits"
Like Michael did to Fredo, pops shoulda had a captain
But showed too much compassion and unc' end up rattin' and
Just reminiscin' as I package and deliver product
Great men diminish cause snitches often fuckin' the plot up
Put dollars on my daddy books, unc', fuck him for life
Third generation black businessman, my product white

[Hook 3]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sitting in the Phantom and it's white on white

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Coming from nothin', I had to hustle up somethin'
I had to get me some paper, I had to pull me a caper
I tucked the Glock in my khakis, I told the bitch I'll be back
She told me "Daddy, be careful, you know all these niggas is rats"
Ain't no fear in my heart, and ain't no lies in my tongue
Won't die broke, I put that on the breath in my lung
All of my clips extended, nothin' I live's pretended
They threw a case in my face, but I was safe and defended
As I stomp on the street, on the road less traveled
As I look up to God as he look down on the gravel
I ask for protection, from hammers and gavels
And blasphemous devils, somebody, pass 'em this message

[Hook 4]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Sitting in the Phantom and it's white on white

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Wanna gun me to the ground like Michael Brown
Settled in the projects, now you knock it down
Now my niggas wanna ride till we all expired
Smoked a ounce for my dog on the day he died
Sprayed yo' name on the walls in the project hall
Died for his red rag so it's for the cause
Bullet holes rip the seams in them denim jeans
The Lorraine Motel was a guillotine
Revolution's televised, operation pushed
Held a burden and a prize under George Bush
Burt back home, nigga did a quarter
Rigor mortis is the only thing that prison taught him
Flippin' quarters

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Hmm, ooh-ooh, ooh
Well, well, well
Hmmmmmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white[Intro: Rashad]

Elevate the game, Blue Collar Gang yea
Elevate the game, Blue Collar Gang yea

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Under lampposts and street lights
Stomachs ache, we ain't eat right
Mama working two jobs, so she barely sleeping at night
Daddy ain't seen 'em in years
And last time we spoke he was gone on them beers
High off that rock
Holdin' back his tears
Cause he felt his family turn a slave to the drugs
And lost his sanity and walked out on his kids
But I told him keep his head up, I understand what he did
It's a lot of pressure when you're under pressure with very limited ends
But it ain't how you it started
It's all about how it ends
You told me that as man we never break for the bend
We from the bottom and that dirt we absorb it
Only polish our skin
Hard work is what they commend
So take them hard ships on the chin
Never grin or turn a frown
Or put your head down to them
You're a king, poor or rich
A living testament to these kids so all your dreams
Live it out for them
Get from under that street light
Away from the street life
And be that light out for them

[Hook: Rashad]
No matter how you get this paper
They working 9 to 5s where I live
No, I ain't you never been a hater
But there's more than one way to feed these kids
Blue Collar gang yeah
Elevate the game, Blue Collar Gang yea
Blue collar gang
Elevate the game, Blue Collar Gang yea

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Everybody's hustling to make it
I spoke to my OG he said hustling's overrated
Everybody's chasing dreams but dreams are what you make it
Life is what you make it also and all your decision's gon' cost ya
So choose your life wisely, I'm throwin' dice, ivory
Side betting all my chances no set back no advances
No silver spoons or pamperin'
Soon as you see the dirt you gotta stick both hands in it
I'm gettin' high tryna cancel it
Cold world with no J
It's hard work with no play
9 to 5 or sell yay
I respect it either way
Blue collar, no handouts
Genius so I stand out
I'ma make my own way
Even if I gotta to lay my own land down
Ten toes to the ground, nose to the sky
Royalty in my eyes, I'll never fall to the pride
Or be deprived of my blessings or question life lessons
It's hard work to be a star first and a positive man second

[Hook]

[Outro x2]
Playa haters, rhyme sayers and heartbreakers
Slick talkers and British Knights and Skywalkers
Street hustlers always showing they new dollars
Who's hotter? Who to follow we Blue Collar[Intro: Stalley]
All the way from the South East Side
To the North West Side..
You already know. (Haha!)
Here I am
We all love 77'
[?Milk?] City!
O.H.I.O!
The whole Midwest

[Hook Stalley & (Sample):]
(Boomin) X7
Mutherfuck the police
I'm steady boomin' in the projects
X2

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Them junkies keep on coming back & forth, cause they getting sprung
Taste of my dope, yeah it's real, got they tounge numb
When I was 15, going on 16, I was broke as hell
Hanging in the view, you know I had to find some work to sell
Call my brother Yella, he was deep up in the dope game
Asked him for a sack and he was acting real lame
Started with a 16, turn that to a mixtape
Boomin' in these cars, (ha-ha) I got my own bass
So, boom! I'm bunkin. Been getting it since the 90's
Pull up in the hood, hopping out, kissing babies
Now I got the Monte, I'mma get me a Mercedes
And I put that on the Milk, kinda like a missing baby
I'm shining. I'm Gliding. I'm pushing off through Massillon
Getting to this money so its calculated trafficking
Feds steady trying to build a case, but they can't solve it
So fuck the police, I'm steady boomin' in them projects

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stalley]
I finally got my 'Cedes gold Rollie, and my grill up
Watch me hit the block, you can see the money build up
From the PJ's, on the PJ's with the wheels up
You ain't gotta feel us, we get it how we live, bruh
Started me a label, BCG, blue collar gang
Midwest hustler, do my thing, let my nuts hang
24 hour pharmacy, like a Walgreens
Hustle like a ball team, yeah til' we all clean
Hip-Hop police are on me, they think its more than rap
Used to run the trap, slinging packs, now we running rap
D-Boy selling D, DJ run it back, this the anthem
Marching on the block, till' the bands come
Task Force tried to sweep us out like a sandstorm
Still found a bed full of money I can land on
Didn't do the crack, but this rap got me living large
So, fuck the police, I'm steady boomin' in them projects

[Hook][Hook: Gunplay]
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Bang) (Aye)
Chain smokin' in my chain. (Mang) (Aye)
I'm chain smokin' in my chain
(I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin' man, I'm smokin')

[Verse 1: Stalley]:
I be picking through the stickiest of greenery
28 grams on my Cuban link
Riding shirtless in the TransAm bumpin' Cuban links
Cardies on my face, diamonds in my pinkie ring
Midwest nigga from the streets to the kitchen sink
Grape switcher sweets and a box of Middletons
I go straight to my connect, I don't need a middle man
A zip of blue dream and platinum cookies
This is big dog smoke school, we don't toke with rookies
And my jewels give you that 1989 feel
All solid 24k from david and will
4g out of real on my '76 Seville
Ridin' slow through the hills
I'm Beverly, one toke, two tokes
Got me feeling heavenly
Top down riding around chain smokin'
Chain pokin' for all a y'all to see
And my nigga Gunplay tell em bring some more weed

[Hook: Gunplay]

[Verse 2: Curren$y]:
Niggas try to sound like grime lipe [?]
Say they get high like the one in the bubblegum blue 52
Bel Air at the fair rollin gold shoes
Whole shoes fans fair
Very rare you find an ounce of this shit anywhere
Cuz you incredibly square
Nobody trust you, you actin like the feds
Smokin' to my head
Cuz the one that I wanna pass the doobie to dead
My momma and my girlfriend scared, cuz I be outside
But don't worry baby, I know how to play it
Watching while I'm blazin', all my jury on
OG in the bomb space station, home basis
From the club to the fool spot
We all racing, we got paper
We all make it fast as we can spend it
Take a new hundred, roll that weed in it

[Hook: Gunplay]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]:
I'm khal jokins [?], chain smokin'
In a sem tray[?], Chevrolet, everyday chokin'
And the paint like white cocaine
My dog say match when I'm like "okay"
Fresh paper, raw paper
Trippy stick, kush or
The color syrup maple
All vapor
To the crib, this bad bitch
I'm gon' take her, then wife her, then break up
Leather seats
My swisher forever sweet
Fresh off probation let's celebr-eat
They be tardy for the party but I'm never late
Put the fire to the tip 'til I levitate
Four strands, loud as four bands
Tryna hold smoke, she tryna hold hands
This shit fire like I'm rolling up a sun
On a back to back run
Coughing up a lung

[Hook: Gunplay][Intro:]
O-O-O-Ohio

[Hook: Rashad]
Chevelle, chevelle, chevelle (chevelle)
Chevelle, you know me well (know me well)
Got me gassing you up, taking you out on the town
Poppin' the trunk, showing you off
So sexy when your top's down

[Verse 1:]
I just wanna show you off to the whole world
Make everyone mad, especially my old girl
I ain't gassin' when I say you're my only girl
Those new shoes and new coach, you better go girl
Go girl, you know this your world
You're so thorough, twerk for me, that talk is so real
Made of steel, my superwoman, for real
I spend four bills just to make that ass fat
And put four twelves in it to make that ass clap
Now you're booming, yeah you're booming, how I like it
You stay clean but that bubble gum light [scent?]
Dark tin, our alone time is well spend
[?] The city cruising on the rode trips
You're my ride or die, my down ass chick
My first crush, my first love, since a little ass kid
I hung posters of you, hoping one day, I'll get
A chance to show you how deep this love for you is

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
She's so systematic, she's so afrocentric
She's so black and strong, she's so wide and long
She won't ever let me get lost, she loves to take control
But yeah she knows who's the boss and she loves when I floss
Round the city, top down, flashin' the [?]
Big blunts burning, smoke flowing, like an exhaust
Engine purring, cat wet, feel the bass and like that
A fishtail she throw it right back, she love when I get under her
Grip the wheel and talk to her, her skin so soft and comfortable
She do whatever I want her to, the whole city in love with her
Kids cuddle around her, pointing at her curve
Telling me 'I can't wait to get older and find a girl like yours'
They wanna sit inside and listen to all her words
Her volume loud, I bet your father smilin' down on us
The first time I took you out we sat by the [?]
Conversing all night long, listening to LaVere

[Hook]

[Outro: Rashad]
Chevelle, chevelle, chevelle chevelle
Chevelle, you know me well (you know me well)
Girl you know me well, girl you know me well (Oooh)[Verse 1]

I be driftin on some other ish
Tryin to make money, I'm on my Southern ish
But quietly I'm tryin to be where the money is
Between Chevy's and them Spaceships
A calming Earth is what I'm dying for, but I'm in to hatin shit
Like whack rappers and boppin chicks
Tryin to shake pockets be on some mockin ish
All types of birds in this dirty game
So I keep a couple wolves with some sturdy aim
Be my mobbin ish
Hittin targets from miles away
But usually, this side of my mind is cooped up
But it's out today and it's driftin
Z28 with the shift and Chevy doors lift and
I'm showin out, no more holdin out
And half these niggas don't know what to talk about
So they blabbin out, as far as confidence and throwin bars
My content goes beyond stars
Super stardom, Post-pardon
Emo Joggin, it's all Hardy Har when
It's laughter in the air
So I puff the swisher blow the smoke in the air
And watch through the clouds all these problems disappear
As the ashes fall to the side along with these spheres
They say this type of wisdom comes with years
And I'm wise beyond mine, A cold nigga
A Red Diamond out the coal mine, Newly found
So hold time, as I hold mine down
Prince became King, tell em they can give me my crown
NOW

[Sample]

Listen people are you ready?
