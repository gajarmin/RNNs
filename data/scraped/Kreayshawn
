Who knows where you have been
I don't know how you do it, don't know how you do it

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Dev]
I hope you're realizing what goes up will then come down
You know what's coming around, you know what's coming 'round
You're gonna lose the one thing everybody wish they had found
Don't you come crying to me now, don't you come crying now

[Verse 3: Kreayshawn]
Ricky, ricky, ricky, such an innocent flirt
Scumbag bros gettin' lower than dirt
Hollywood know-it-alls, skinny [?]

Fuckin' all the groupie hoes just to be in videos
I can't believe I fall for the individuals
Oh what? You thought I was done? Hey!
Get a little fame, now you wanna have some fun?
Go ahead and fuck with those sweet chicks
And see what kind of spots pop up, up on your dick (Ew!)

[Hook] (x2)

One big room full of bad bitches

[Hook]
And we stunting like
Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada
Basic bitches wear that shit so I don't even bother

[Verse 1]
Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada
Them basic bitches wear that shit, so I don't even bother
I put that on my partner, I put that on my family
Oakland city represent, address me as your majesty
Yeah you can kiss the ring, but you can never touch the crown
I smoke a million Swisher blunts and I ain't never coming down
Bitch, you ain't no Barbie, I see you work at Arby's
Number 2, super-sized, hurry up I'm starving
Gnarly, radical, on the block I'm magical
See me at your college campus baggie full of Adderalls
Call me if you need a fix, call me if you need a boost
See them other chickenheads? They don't never leave the coop
I'm in the coupe cruising, I got the stolen plates
Serving all the fiends over there by the Golden Gate
Bridge, I'm colder than the fridge and the freezer
I'm snatching all your bitches at my leisure

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada
I'm lookin like Madonna but I'm flossing like Ivana
Trump, you know I keep that work in my trunk
Got my hand on the pump if you wanna press your luck
I'm yelling "Free V-Nasty" 'til my throat is raspy
Young, rich and flashy I be where the cash be
You can't find that? I think you need a Google Map
My pearl-handled kitty-cat will leave and press your noodle back
Now Google that groupies follow me like Twitter
I'm rolling up my catnip and shitting in your litter
Why you looking bitter? I be looking better
The type of bitch that make you wish that you ain't never met her
The editor, director plus I'm my own boss
So posh, nails fierce with the gold gloss
Which means nobody getting over me
I got the swag and it's pumping out my ovaries

[Hook]

[Outro]
Oh, all you basic-ass hoes out there
Man, I got rooms full of bad bitches
They don't need Gucci, they don't need Louis
We swagging, ehh, meow[Hook, Kreayshawn]
Caught my man cheating
Now I'm rolling through the west side
'bout to burn this fucking house down
Like I'm left eye
Like I'm left eye
'bout to burn this motherfucker down like I'm Left Eye
Heard my man is cheating with another bitch at my house
Now I'm going to make a scene like Amy Winehouse!
Amy Winehouse
Amy Winehouse
'bout to burn this motherfucker down like Amy Winehouse!

[Verse 1]
I don’t need no TLC, all I need is THC
Higher than miss Courtney Love
Murder in the first degree
Certainly you got me confused with them stupid broads
Shooting dice in the streets taught me how to play the odds
I find it odd that your twitter page is private
You got two phones, one of them stays silent
Now who the fuck is calling in the middle of the night?
They hang up the phone when I pick up, bout to grab my knife
You trynna play me like a boss
But you're faker than Rick Ross
When you fall asleep I'm 'bout to cut your fuckin' dick off
I'm about to call my goons and stick you for you guap
You tell a lot of lies but I let my bullets talk
You think you slick?
But this might be your big regret
Them pictures of your skinny dick is gonna hit the internet
I should key your car but I'd rather slap your mom
Only a bitch can give birth to such a fucking dog

[Hook]

[Verse 2,]
I'm about to run up in this bitch with choppas like I'm Patty Hearst
Stylish but violent, I'll leave you in a tinted hearse
In my purse I got that .22 to get the job done
And V-nasty whips the ghetto way, you know how I mob son!
I'm Lorena Bobbitt chillin' in your bed
I'm Britney Spears on Hella drugs and I just shaved my head
Fuck the feds and the police
Ain't nobody touchin' me
Thelma and Louise
Suicide girl thuggery!

[Hook]

Rest In Peace Amy![Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Flexing, flexing, Lean, flexing like a rubber band
I be ballin', I be ballin', all this money in my hand
Alcohol in everything, Sad Boys, that's the dark man
G-T-B-S-B, Sad Boys leave your body with the others man
Leave 'em in another land
See me, see me in that Rolls Royce
I've been counting all this money with my team, Sad Boys Worldwide Entertainment
Lean go harder, name any lame rapper, Lean much smarter
See me flying at you, living large, I'm living larger
I love this life, this ain't no departure
Swedish ho, but I'm harder
I've been out there working, Imma, Imma work harder
North Face bucket hat, hunna, hunna’s in my armor
So many plants, Lean could be a gardener
They step up to me and my partners
I've been out there, I've been working, Imma work harder
Rose on plants make me train sharper
17 years old, I'm going farther
Getting farther because it's me and Kreayshawn
Yung Lean bitch it's me I run the game
Tell your weapon let the rest run through your brain

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Kreayshawn, Kreayshawn
When you coming back man you must be off
I was never on
Tell my friends who think I'm famous, no they're wrong
I'm feeling sad, the label left me cause I'm a mom
Now I've got a future but I'm still looking for where I belong
I cry my ass off every night but it's all inside
I hold my fist up and I shake it to them cloudy skies
Why me?, why me?, why am I so fly?
All this pressure to be cool makes me a sad guy

[Verse 3: Yung Lean]
Riding, smoking dart packs in the streets
Wanna get rid of me, I've been popping literally
See me up on everything
Sad boys style, good as fuck
I don't need no education, just a basement and some thugs
Louis duffle bags, duffle bags in my trunk
See me in the fucking club, at the back, blowing doves
Sad Boys is my team, no you cannot join
Flipping my change, I'm so fly for definite, flipping my coin, ripping your groin
Keeping these songs, emotional boys for life
Don't be so cold, sus the phones, telephone, gave right this earth phone
Demons inside me, that is so wrong
Hoes on my lap, wish I could take the time back
Wake up and she's gone
Stupid chains, ice in my veins
I'm Misaki when it rains, woke up and felt no pain
I'm happy with my friends, just want to remain the same
Catch me sipping champagne
Too futuristic for all you lames
Inhumane, think I give a fuck what other people say?
Got my team with me, you should turn the other way
Don't talk to me cause you know I don't talk much
Rolling up the Dutch, I pull up don't touch
When the room shines, I don't close my eyes[Intro]
Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up
(We trippy mane)
Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Juicy J and Kreayshawn, that's a smoking marathon
I take a shot, I take a shot, that's a drinking marathon
Double cup of that kickstand, all I know is big bands
Juicy J got bitches, fuck with my pimpin'
Pinky ring on my pimp hand with the lean is how a pimp stand
Oh I sound like Snoop Dog, coupe de ville with two broads
Sippin' on that Texas Tea, niggas call me Boss Hog
(Trippy) At your local college, baggy full of adderall
(So trippy) With a strap on me, fuck the gun law
(Too trippy) If you blow my high then I'm going off
Trippy, trippy, trippy, I don't think you get it mane
I walk around the club smellin' like a Sinex mane

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
(Duh... haaa)
He a trip, I'm a trip, but no fallin' out
We back-pourin syrup all up on the trap couch
Purple body shots on that bitch, I let it drip
Rolled her head back, now she's saying she can't handle it
That's KREAY, she hid a trippy stick out her ass
Juicy J sat me down and taught me well in trippy class
I got so much trip, I fell asleep high, I woke up high
If I'm sober, I lie!
That's some downers man, they really got my mind singin'
If I was a car I'd be purple wood grain swingin'(Ayee)
Leanin' never beanin', felonies and misdemeanors
So trippy mane, you can call me Juicy Gina!

[Hook] x2[Kreayshawn]

I don't need no TLC
Ay, I just need some THC
Hey, I'm higher than miss Courtney Love
Like murder, in the 1st degree? Certainly
You got me confused with them stupid broads
Shooting dice in the streets taught me how to play the odds
I find it odd that your Twitter page is private
You got 2 phones, one of them stays silent
Now who the fuck is callin in the middle of the night?
They hanging up when I pick up, I'm bout to grab my knife
You tryna play me like a boss, but you faker than Rick Ross, bitch
I'll cut your dick off, like Lorena Bobbitt
Yeah, I'm Kreayshawn and you can't stop it
I'm Britney Spears, and I just shaved my head
I'm on hella-drugs: that's what I said
I run up in your house with choppers like I'm Patty Hearst
I'm stylish but violent like a tinted hearse
And in my purse I got that .22
I got the job done, you are a fool
And V-Nasty, she driving the ghetto way
I don't give a fuck man, I'm Kreayshawn, I'm from the Bay
And I'm from Oakland, oh we stay smoking
A big blunt leaking out my mouth and I'm toking

And you can catch me loaded on the block man
No dirty socks, I'm a clean girl
I rock the world, like a Spice Girl
I'm fallin off my chair cause I'm so high, man
I get high all the time, all this shit on my mind
But I got no trees with me I'm in Philly
Someone please give me an O!
I need weed, about a gram and a Dutch Master, please!
Please deliver it quick
I need to get high so I can freestyle right, man
This ain't a joke, young Kreayshawn come through
Facebook poke you[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]

Yeah
Taking it day by day's what a young nigga do
Keepin' it lit, putting on for the crew
Shades in the beam, yelling out, "what it do?"
Mobbin' round town whip got no roof
Have you seen it?
Think the fucking top's gone missin'

They say I"m hard headed, bruh, I don't wanna listen
2 Chainz say bitch I'm different
Mad black drop top, bitch I'm whippin'

Pretty bitches wanna kick it like Judo
Mobbin' round town, pockets fat like a sumo!

[Verse 1]
Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada
Them basic bitches wear that shit, so I don't even bother
I put that on my partner, I put that on my family
Oakland city represent, address me as your majesty
Yeah you can kiss the ring, but you can never touch the crown
I smoke a million Swisher blunts and I ain't never coming down
Bitch, you ain't no Barbie, I see you work at Arby's
Number 2, super-sized, hurry up I'm starving
Gnarly, radical, on the block I'm magical
See me at your college campus baggie full of Adderalls
Call me if you need a fix, call me if you need a boost
See them other chickenheads? They don't never leave the coop
I'm in the coupe cruising, I got the stolen plates
Serving all the fiends over there by the Golden Gate
Bridge, I'm colder than the fridge and the freezer
I'm snatching all your bitches at my leisure

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada
I'm lookin like Madonna but I'm flossing like Ivana
Trump, you know I keep that work in my trunk
Got my hand on the pump if you wanna press your luck
I'm yelling "Free V-Nasty" 'til my throat is raspy
Young, rich and flashy I be where the cash be
You can't find that? I think you need a Google Map
My pearl-handled kitty-cat will leave and press your noodle back
Now Google that groupies follow me like Twitter
I'm rolling up my catnip and shitting in your litter
Why you looking bitter? I be looking better
The type of bitch that make you wish that you ain't never met her
The editor, director plus I'm my own boss
So posh, nails fierce with the gold gloss
Which means nobody getting over me
I got the swag and it's pumping out my ovaries

[Hook]

[Outro]
Oh, all you basic-ass hoes out there

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Dev]
I hope you're realizing what goes up will then come down

You're gonna lose the one thing everybody wish they had found
Don't you come crying to me now, don't you come crying now

[Verse 3: Kreayshawn]

Let me bring you back to summer school, I'm working hard
People grinding everyday, but they don't understand my job
Came from soil where the roots are underestimated
Roses grow from concrete but don't nobody care to save them
I chose my own path, the worlds so uncertain now
People you grew up with, the first ones to bring you down
I made this song for anybody that relates it now
Anybody with a dream or anybody with a smile
I guarantee if you help another person out
You start to see yourself in the eyes of a new born child
Words is bond, so my writing like jail time
No watch, just life, I don't see the time

[Hook: Lil B] x2
I am the Wind
I am the Earth
I am the Skies
I am the Souls
I am the Love
I am the Pain
I am the Dream
I am the Rain

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I sit and think by myself, Does the world hate me?
Not really, But the people is the one who's shady
I spit knowledge and the youth looks at me crazy
How we all equal, But we won't elect the lady
It all starts from the heart for the massive changes
Learn to love or to hate, help the ones who's racist
You would understand if one day we change of places
Life not a soap opera no change of faces
But remain humble, ask questions often
Anytime my next bedroom is a coffin
Live life cause we the only summer out in Boston
Live life cause ain't all about the money flossin'

[Hook: Lil B] x2

[Verse 3: Kreayshawn]
Pan in hand, my stars align
Step in the spaceship of my mind
Into a galaxy of trees, I leave reality behind
In my own world I'm the ruler, no measure how I do it
Words my energy, the fuel
At rocket speed my mind is movin'
Of this I don't see 'em
Solo mission made from feelin'
Don't accept the cards, I deal 'em
Asteroid hits, when revealin'
So they smash like doves
Feels my heartbeat's rushing flood
I'm blessed from above, music my galactic love

[Hook: Lil B] x2[Intro - Rick Ross]
Yeah this Rick Ross the big boss
Right now you checkin in with DJ Woogie
The muthafuckin king, this some Bay Area's finest

"I dunno man, like, we're hella-close friends, right?"
"Yeah man, we're friends.."
"Alright, that's good, cause I mean like.."
"Ay man, your verse is about, like, a lesbian, so.."
"Oh no, I don't know about that.."

"I just wanna be your friend
And we can hang out and smoke weed til the very end
And when it ends, we can roll it up again
Now we gonna be the best of friends, I can tell
We're gonna hang out a lot
Hot box your car in the parking lot
Before we go upstairs, play with each other's hair
And when we're done, we can go
Watch some crazy movies! The time we spend
It really moves me, makes me wanna be your wife
Now that it's legalized..
I don't wanna go home, can I spend the night?
Can we have a slumber party pillow fight?
Can I borrow your shirt? I want to spend the night
Can you show me where you shower?
I think you're really cool, this is how I am
And if you wanna hook up, I'd be down with that shit
But until the time's right, I can be your friend
And we can go out and dance on the weekend
Maybe go to a bar? Now I'm 21
And mob on any bitch who try to say some
Please. The time we spend is gonna be different
Cause of two different lifestyles we living
Until we got back home..

Friends til the end like Child's Play
You can get hit 24/7 smoking lots of haze
What shall we do? ?
Slow your roll and pump your brakes
I would like nothing more
Yeah I wanna make out
Great night: movies and Chinese take out
Let's break out, we're far away
So I have to get to you, travelling at
The speed of light in a spaceship made for two
Just one way. Vroom vroom!
On the porch smoking dro, moving slowIntro: Oh, oh, it's Kreayshawn bro

In the picture, I wish I was kicking it with you
But I can't so I'mma go do my fucking dance bitch
What it do, I'm gonna fuck your crew
And after I'm done then I'm gonna kill you
I will kill you, and it's nothing to me
Run up on you with the Jimmy and the Kimmy
Pull out the Tommy, like salami

Bitch I'm so heavy, like a fucking weight
Lift me up, pull me down, I'm off the ground
I'm too heavy for you to carry around

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]

Put me on your back girl
Run around with me on your back
Like a piggy back ride
I run up when I ride girl
And the side girl got the mac girl
And if you acting crazy then I'll have to react girl
Don't fucking play with me like it's a joke
Not on facebook, I will fucking poke
You in the eye, and I don't play
I hope you lose your vision, I'm from the Bay
You can't see me, or on t.v
Maybe on ustream, you can really act like you know me
When you add me on twitter
Don't be acting like hella bitter
When I don't follow you back
It's nothing personal
You ain't cooler than me, your status ain't tight
But I will, update all night
And all day, I don't fucking give a shit
Fuck everything, and fuck your fucking bitch
Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck
I can't fucking stop cussing
Shit, fucking, whore
I fucking love cussing
Shit, bitch, ho
Fucking, shit
[Laughing] I don't know all the cuss words
But i'll keep it lit
Fuck You Bitch

[Verse 3: Kreayshawn]

Yeah, yeah, I'm going fucking ham
I'm going fucking spam
And I will kill your man
I will kill your mama
And I will kill your dog
I won't kill your kitty
But i'll steal her and put her in a bag
And take her home, and she can play with my cat too
My cat's a fucking goon, she's a real goon
I got a fucking text message
Who it be, it's Lil B, from the pack
Hey I got five on the dro if you get a blunt
Man you already know, I had a bag of dro
Somewhere and I lost it
I think I gotta go look for it
It is in my pocket

Outro: Yaaaayyy ![Intro]
