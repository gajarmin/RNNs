[G-Child]
Hey, this is the G-Child, spaceketeers
Are ya in the house baby, are ya in the house
You know what I'm sayin, cuz its that time
For you to kicks the funk online as we rewind, then it will combine

[Mista Grimm]
Smokin on the bud, feelin kinda high
Sippin on the gin, feelin kinda fly
A Warren G production sits in the tape deck
As Mista Grimm raps over laps, don't say shit
Just, listen and recline for a spell
Pass the fat spliff back and forth (oh yeah)
Stuck, unable to breathe through the Chronic
Cloud that somehow prevents me from installin fresh air

[Warren G]
Ahh, Indosmoke
Pass me the joint so I can take a toke
1 puff, 2 puff, 3 puff, 4 puff, 5 I'm feelin real high
Leaning to the side in my muthafuckin ride
With the OG gangsta glide
Woo!, hey now ya know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
Breakaway, come again like this
The LB to the C two times to miss
Cuz if you do, you break you get broke
Me and Mista G and the indosmoke ("smoke" x4 in background)

Chorus: Nate Dogg (repeat 2x)
["Are you high yet?" (repeated in background)]
Whatever you do muthafucka you betta not choke
This ain't no stress, its the muthafuckin indo smoke

[Mista Grimm]
Fee, fi, foe, really doe
I'm still smokin and sippin, talkin like a pimp
Freakin, seekin new lands without transport
Cuz indo smoke is a man's sport
I never feel stressed and thats the realist
Just a proper herb for my chronic illness
Please, let me go on with my day
Relax with phat tracks and a real fat J
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Astounded from what it did sended me far above
On a fly cloke I can brag for days
You can't swim with Grimm
Because my tidal wave's - high
And that's no joke
Because Mista Grimm takes flight from the indo smoke ("smoke" 4x in background)

Chorus x2

[Mista Grimm]
Ignition to remission blast off through the cos
Most of the voyage I enjoy is just a cause
I sonic boom when I return back to earth
Birth of a new rhyme will take no time
I'm prepared, papers and a lighter to provoke
A comical scene to watch Mista Grimm choke
Then gain composure, compose a symphony
From C-H-R-O-N-I-C and Mista G mixed together nicely
Combining lick the linings vaula
A fat Chronic sack you can put in your jaw
H and R puff the stuff in ya lungs
Smokin on the Chronic, gettin straight sprung
Stretched, taken to the extreme feelin
Dancin on the ceilin like Lionel
If ya hear me on some vinyl
I break em till they can't be broke
As I soak, in da indo smoke ("smoke" 4x in background)

[Nate Dogg]
["Are you high yet?" (repeated in background)]
Take a trip with Nate Dogg to the Eastside
We will show you wether our gangstas love to get high
We get high on every street in Long Beach
So don't come to my hood thinkin' that you can save me

Niggas from (?) foreign (?) land (?) wanna come to the East and reveal (?)
I gotta viscious left hook and you're damn right I will steal
Shots go out to my nigga Mista Grimm and you know Warren G
I gotta nigga named Gangsta Rod, you know B-Tip you know me
My name is Nate D-O double G and I'm comin straight from the East
Don't think you dont know where I'm from, I'm from 213

[Outro: G-Child]

Oh we can do this then
Hey, let's go
Its over big baby, hey[Hook: Warren G - repeat 4X]
It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you (we do it nasty, nasty)

[Warren G]
I once knew a girl named LaShonda
Short little cute thing
With a pinky diamond ring
She was iceless
My game was so priceless
Givin her a facial
I was G'd up
From the feed up
Pushin the bent
With the midnight tint
Huh, heaven sent

[Mista Grimm]
I once met a girl in the valley and
Half black half Italian
Ass like a stalian
Coke bottles shake
As she likes to watch herself on tape
Breakin nuts shake, but wait there's more
She keeps my nuts in her mouth like a squirrel
Pranksta with a pearl
Held my balls so long
I call trouble when I'm with my girl

[Warren G]
There's a law for that
We ain't trippin, we hogs for that
Uh

[Hook: Warren G and LaToiya - repeat 4X]
It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you
(we do it nasty, nasty)

[Damone]
I met this Puerto Rican named Sehonnie
She was as bad as Carmen
Chillin in New York and I cracked her in Spanish Harlem
Straight dime
Body bangin like a baseline
And the face fine
I had to spit dip waste time
Mr. Passionate
Everything her body was immaculin
The presence like a gift to men and got packaged

[Boss Hogg]
Fuckin fabolous
She say "damn he fat"
Then I still fuck the ass (how you do that)
Push up on 'em till they fall to the plot, damn it
Uh, hog 'em while they fuckin roll, goddamn it
Call me fat boy with a fat dick to mash
To lick me baby and I might lick you back

[Damone]
Lickin you back
She's gaggin with a dick in her trap
And stickin is fat
I'll pull it out and tickle your cat

[previous Hook]

[Warren G]
I put the smash on her like Shaq
She want the cash on her
I ain't havin that
You need to check yo' trap
I got rose cap
G'd up, 213, please believe that

[Mista Grimm]
I stay pimpin in a bubble I Benz
With hoes stubbled up and cuddled in the back with my friends
I slide up on 'em like a cross fader
The hook up later
And serve this dick like a waitor
I ain't tryna date her

[Damone]
When it comes to bitches
I got more game than the olympics
I get up in their mind and analyze and twist this, psychology
For no reason I'm recievin apologies
Break her down mentally
Have her stockin and follow me

[Boss Hogg]
Trick be swallowin me
For a nine on the vein
Cuz I'm the fuckin boss, she's my employee
I ain't hatin, I appreciate you freaky ass style
Yo nasty ass ?, eat a dick and smile

[previous Hook] - 2XI got an idea...

I had a plan to grow indo'
Therefore the outdo' was to be recreated, duplicated in a grow room
Wanted to produce the kinda plant that you could display up in a showroom
So beautiful, but yet stinky
Stick to your thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky
And the brain
First thing was to provide setting for proper cultivation
Discrete location
Ten by ten foot spot
Lit up by a thousand watt
Lamp, plus two air-vents for the air to circulate
And ehm - I calculate
30 gallons of water a week, I'm really into this
Now all I need is some good fertilizer and some photosynthesis
To proceed, after I choose the right seeds to fall in motion
With a little love and devotion
I can make the front cover of _High Times_
I hope I never get busted and have to pay some fines
For havin a 'secret garden' like Barry White
I must not tell anyone and keep my lips sealed tight
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope

During the first stage of growth the seeds germinate slow
Start a root system, sprout up some leaves, and grow
Towards the light
Make sure the temperature's right
I was told by this one guy
Watch your plants closely, beware of bugs and fungi
They'll hurt your garden, they'll only interfere
With the vegetative growth that lasts about two months to a year
When full grown flowers bloom big buds and leaves
Watch out for thieves
People like to stash shit up their sleeves
It's not been three months
I'm tempted to break off a piece and roll some blunts
I wonder what it is, is this some Skunk?
I see some purple stems and orange hairs
Could it be the Humble mixed with Maui? It's a hybrid
Wow! Look what I did
I got the green thumb
Observe the superb herb
Bushy branches, loud smell
Like green pastel
I got it on deck for all seasons
And if anyone asks, it's for medical reasons
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 		

It's been over four months, time to get high
Uproot the plants and let them hang dry
In a cool room with dry air, for 2 to 3 weeks
And I'ma be waitin right here with my loose leaf sheets
The lovely harvest, it came in different amounts
Four trees, each one just a few grams short of an ounce
I can't wait to smoke it, I know it's the bomb
Been waiting so long, make me wanna write a song
I guess I'll sell 2 ounces and puff on the rest
Find a recipe to sprinkle herb on my filet of chicken breast
Or some tea shot full of THC
Hit the bomb, cut open the swisher sweet
Then come off on weed
Plant stuck to my fingertips as I try to break it down
And when lit, the fruity herby taste is profound
It have me buzzin for a light year, and you best believe I'll have some seeds
And be at it again, yes indeed
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope

	(Took a long pull - hype) ( --] Sadat X )(What goes up
	Must come down --] Biz Markie )

[ VERSE 1 ]
MC's - you need deeper concentration
Cause wack rhymes and crews lead to non-profit organizations
I attack like anxiety with the variety
]From the western society - baby
Seeing is believing, but looks can be deceiving
You might think you're coming with it, nigga, but you're leaving
With lyrics I'm conceiving
Morning, afternoon and evening
You can't wait
My shit's special like a .38
(You got a problem?)
I smoke some boo boo, now I'm spaced out like astrology
Getting in MC's asses like proctology
It's seems that everybody's going through a phase
Thinkin they can bust, but they're weak like 7 days
All 12 months for every ounce I get 12 blunts
Get the munchies, eat up 12 MC's at once
Thinkin that they wasn't, when they know that they was
The one with the style young, they still got the peachfuzz

	(What goes up
	Must come down)
	(What goes up...)
	(MC's) (...must come down)

[ VERSE 2 ]
When I get stoned like Fred Flint I begin
To smoke MC's like Marian, bury them
Cause most be comin unnatural like a cesarean
I wish my rhymes were meat and MC's were vegetarians
Cause when it comes to biting, I don't condone it
Besides, you couldn't manage my style if you owned it
I got gruesome rhymes in my mind
And they'll jump on a beat
Infect it when the rhyme is injected
Metaphors are connected
Booty lyrics are deflected
And the mic is intercepted
Cause I never ever leave it neglected
I'm tryina hold my position
What kind of man would I be if my rhymes weren't in mint condidtion
They say "(Hey) Grimm's nowhere to be found"
But they catch me on camera beatin MC's down
Always tryin to ponder what I'm pondering
They need to find theyself, because they're somewhere lost and wandering

	(What goes up
	Must come down)
	(What goes up...)
	(MC's) (...must come down)

[ VERSE 3 ]
As we mix a little lyric and track
Like coke and cognac
Premium blend
You're gonna need a driver, designated friend
Cause I intend to seep in your system
Hit hard, make MC's change agenda
Disregard their rhymes, return to sender
I got soul like Dr. Scholl eatin a bowl of neckbones
I like my shit loud enough to where it blows your headphones
If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys makin hits
Assassination other crews, posses, and clicks
The main thing's to get down and say my peace
Whoever disrespects, I'm Rushen like Patrice
I'll never cease with the funky, funky vocals and beats
Cause we need more rappers around flauntin new styles and speaks
I know we're amped to get the money, cause we need it
But if your lyrics ain't tight, the whole purpose is defeated
You can't shine and be on top with the wack sound
It's time to watch all the burnt out stars hit the ground[Warren G]
Waiting around a crew of thugs
That parade in blue, and yelling cuz (whats up cuz)
Ate by selling drugs
'38 snub in the waist, in case fools lose love
These days still the same
I concealed the flame, eyes kill with the pain
So I advise y'all to chill with the games
Entertain for the cheddar and the change
So fuck whoever, in the fame, forever remain
Around my dogs, banging the pound, swanging the town
How we choose, now I'm aggravated and assault is my next move
Success means issues, so I guess it's time for me to disclude
Handle mines, we use pistols
G's move with the conscience
When we disapprove of that nonsense
Ex-cons with that gangsta gangsta gangsta shit
Here come another hit

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination, in the industry
Here comes another one

[Mista Grimm]
I can see us smashing up the shore past laws thats lost
2000 Ucon Excel, duel exhaust
TV screen, DVD, E-mail
Passenger, bad female, what the hell
Stash spot, with the hollow head shell
Niggas start trippin, I'm on the next tail
Hands free, callin' up my nigga Warren G
I pull strings, like Meyer Lansky
Bulletproof, limo tint you can't see
Mr. G rollin' up weed, afghany sensee
Bad MC, Mike Fiend, you the know spinage
Like winter green mint, talk shit
Sleep with the fish, you cement
New residence, with no hesitance
It gets tints on the floor
Staple center chick, next to Denzel and Nicholsen
Phil Jackson whistlin'

[Hook]

[Warren G]
Mean mugs in the club, mean nothing to us
In South scene, me and the team trying to fuck us some sluts
Dying to fuck, I chuck us when we step through
Poppin' our collars, with our nephews
Next to you, you got millionaires moving
Hitting the dance floor, stealing their groovin'
Doing they damn thing, and ain't worried about a damn thing
But man, thats the celebrity ways
Poppin' a litty got some rappers scared of these days
Industry ways, thats how Hollywood pays
Uh, top dollar when I dip my Impala
In front of the club, make your woman wanna holla (holla)
At a playa though, what's your dude yo
I keep it gangsta, I ain't trying to be rude ho
Oh, you know how that shit go
Or give when cats get fed off the four or fifths

[Hook][Mista Grimm]
Eeeee-bonics
Ain't nothin' but a fancy word for slang
A language often used when you kick it and hang
There's words like "soda"
I pinched her ass so da
Bitch got mad
Take the word "offer"
Then came her dad
So I quickly got off her
There's a bunch how bout "homade"
I was hungry the so the ho made me lunch
Yeah pretty soon
There will be books on how to speak it taught in the classroom
But to us it's nothing new (naw)
You hear it on the avenue
Even on the bus, at a barbecue
It's spoken, by people of all ages
I even put it in my rap pages and bust it on stages
But you'll have to excuse me
I'm stepping out this evening
I hope what I've been sayin' you're "believing"
Cause I'll be leaving
In a minute to a black tie affair
I bet they got the bomb weed there
That's ebonics

Hook:
I know ebonic I know ebonics
Do you know ebonics            (x2)

[Mista Grimm]
I like to be discrete when on the phone
I don't want the pigs all up in my home
I just call up the homies I'm dry like a bone
Got some vegetable? "aw yeah"
Plug me in with a zone
And if I must say it works rather well
Just keep it on the down low, that mean don't tell
My styles funky and I don't mean the smell
Get yourself a stash box to hide the periphanala (ya)
Must be a fool if ya haven't learned
That getting jacked, it's not a sexual term
It means you're gonna get robbed
Get yourself a strap
That's a gun, roll with it, on your lap
Don't mess with bummy hoes that try to throw the coochie
Cause the bitch is low budget in ebonics, hootchie
And if ya at the sto' use the word "domain"
Say "Hold the do' man"
There ya go

Hook

[Mista Grimm]
A- arrest
B- broke

Song: Situation: Grimm

(Val Young)
All the hustlers in the house better recognize
All the players in the house better recognize that
Things are looking grimm

Verse1
It was a cold dark night full moon shining bright
Rain showers wind blowin' at 90 miles an hour
I could barely see my shadow
Sparked up a fat ol' Philly
As fat as free Willy really
It's kind of chilly in my brain
Rappers get nightmares like Dana Dane man
This type scares optometrist
Plain and simple it's all mind and wrist
On a tempt Oh my goodness could this
Be the format where I'm at
In the abyss underground other sound
Top ten list-erine just to keep my vocals cleanest
Meanest you ever seen this incredible like the Hulk
I stay awoke alphabetical twista mista
With a rap book guaranteed to leave a
Gloomy outlook

Chorus (Val Young)
All the hustlers in the house better recognize
That things are looking grimm
All the players in the house better recognize
That things are looking grimm

Verse2
Oh boy watch me throw the bomb like Troy Aikman
And knock out eight men
Goddamn shit it's miraculous
This mysterious immaculate
History makin' rap sheet on a beat
Leavin' niggas shakin' from follicle to feet
With funkanisms shining like a prism SPINK
Sparkling remarkably glowing as I think thought thunk
Conceived off the skunk but funk
Best believe that it stunk
Not your ordinary fragrance
Wash cleanse your mind with Grimm
Squash wash watch out now
Here's me hear me Smack
Check your eardrum
Is it intact in fact?
[Coughing] when?
Approximately when the situation's grimm

Chorus

Verse3
Normally I formally introduce afflawed
Not true and technique and stick to it
Magnifique unique eek what have we
Mathematics for attics that equal cavi
And then some then some MC's make 'em crumble
When I mumble cause I'm fly like a bumble
C-O-V-I-N-A on the western area
Niggas are sick like malaria
Never smoke rock cause it's deadly
I just stick to Indo smoke and the medleys
Steadily developing on the constant
Causing a heat wave like Linda Rhimestead
Can't we look at how I hook it and present
Proof how the mind was took and shook in past tense
For ladies and gents here's the invitation
[Things are looking grimm] (over last line)
One way ticket to a grimm situation

Chorus with ad libs until fade out[Warren G]

Smokin on the Chronic, gettin straight sprung

Hit a switch watch it bounce up (GOOD GRIEF)
Meet me in the Elco with gold leaf (WHO)
Grimm big pimpin' like Filmore Slim
[Warren G]
Tilted brim Mista Grimm rollin' shotgun hop one
Drop one, nigga hit 'em with the Bop Gun
[Mista Grimm]
Yeah I got the chronic its ferocious
You can feel it in your bones like osteoporosis
West coast shit, Im grabbin my gonads
And slangin' gangsta vocabs straight of the notepad
[Warren G]
Aft the dope sack quote that gangsta funk
Warren G, what y'all thought?
Bringing the funk

[Hook (1/2)]

[Mista Grimm]
You listening to G rhymes and I'm here to drop lines
I got that funky fly shit that you wanna hear all the time
All in your system like menthol, yes y'all
Just remove cd from package then install
In your stereo here you go
New material grand imperial
Eat your Mista Grimm cereal
Hit the floor whats rough rugged, twenty four karat nugget like the microphones I carry in my Gucci luggage
I'm Thuggish Ruggish
To the bone marrow and soak in linen apparel talkin the double barrel
Black super hero rhymin'
Rappin sittin busting like its nothing still puffin' coughin chokin
Wild up in the fan's in Oakland floatin
Swerving, taking the dirty version between Persians
Sippin burbon brand new Excursion
Message: Salt kills snails (Saaaaalt)
Nah playas its that West Covina rhyme sayer, yeah

[Hook (order of lyrics switches)]

[Warren G]
Mista G.R.I.M.M. we done dropped one
With my Uncle George we done lock one
Atomic Dog, Knee Deep, in the fast lane
[Mista Grimm]
With the 454 engine block burnin' rubber for a block
Psycho like a Hictchcock flick
Trick, sinister thoughts streamin' while let'n out shots adrenaline pumpin'
G Dub say somethin'
[Warren G]
Supercalifragilocus you could quote this off that purple
You can blow this
Light up pass it around
We make the world go round like the G Funk sound
[Mista Grimm]
I keep the pedal to the medal
Speed dreamin', slidin', dip n glidin'
Chocolate Thai high
Come on, jump in, let's ride, hop in the Mothership
And dip with Mista Grimm and Warren G
We got that shiznit

[Hook (1/2)]

[George Clinton]
Heres to that someone who can't take the pressure
Mercy for that poor fool who made the news
Who feel pissed on that insist on killing all men
Can't take the sorrow of the horrors of his abuse
It ain't worth the sorrows to cause the death ......all men
He's a disgrace to the species in to his face with some feces
Big nose mothafucka got it comin'
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a sucker?
How late do you have to be before you get absent?
Warren G with the P you beta step aside, I'll stick my foot so far up in your ass
The water his knee will rise above your head and drown before you get your ass kickin'
Stop stepin' in footsteps hard to keep up with
Warren G stepin' hard but it ain't as hard as it gon' get[Mista Grimm]
Eeeee-bonics
Ain't nothin' but a fancy word for slang
A language often used when you kick it and hang
There's words like "soda"
I pinched her ass so da
Bitch got mad
Take the word "offer"
Then came her dad
So I quickly got off her
There's a bunch how bout "homade"
I was hungry the so the ho made me lunch
Yeah pretty soon
There will be books on how to speak it taught in the classroom
But to us it's nothing new (naw)
You hear it on the avenue
Even on the bus, at a barbecue
It's spoken, by people of all ages
I even put it in my rap pages and bust it on stages
But you'll have to excuse me
I'm stepping out this evening
I hope what I've been sayin' you're "believing"
Cause I'll be leaving
In a minute to a black tie affair
I bet they got the bomb weed there
That's ebonics

Hook:
I know ebonic I know ebonics
Do you know ebonics            (x2)

[Mista Grimm]
I like to be discrete when on the phone
I don't want the pigs all up in my home
I just call up the homies I'm dry like a bone
Got some vegetable? "aw yeah"
Plug me in with a zone
And if I must say it works rather well
Just keep it on the down low, that mean don't tell
My styles funky and I don't mean the smell
Get yourself a stash box to hide the periphanala (ya)
Must be a fool if ya haven't learned
That getting jacked, it's not a sexual term
It means you're gonna get robbed
Get yourself a strap
That's a gun, roll with it, on your lap
Don't mess with bummy hoes that try to throw the coochie
Cause the bitch is low budget in ebonics, hootchie
And if ya at the sto' use the word "domain"
Say "Hold the do' man"
There ya go

HookI got an idea...

I had a plan to grow indo'
Therefore the outdo' was to be recreated, duplicated in a grow room
Wanted to produce the kinda plant that you could display up in a showroom
So beautiful, but yet stinky
Stick to your thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky
And the brain
First thing was to provide setting for proper cultivation
Discrete location
Ten by ten foot spot
Lit up by a thousand watt
Lamp, plus two air-vents for the air to circulate
And ehm - I calculate
30 gallons of water a week, I'm really into this
Now all I need is some good fertilizer and some photosynthesis
To proceed, after I choose the right seeds to fall in motion
With a little love and devotion
I can make the front cover of _High Times_
I hope I never get busted and have to pay some fines
For havin a 'secret garden' like Barry White
I must not tell anyone and keep my lips sealed tight
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope

During the first stage of growth the seeds germinate slow
Start a root system, sprout up some leaves, and grow
Towards the light
Make sure the temperature's right
I was told by this one guy
Watch your plants closely, beware of bugs and fungi
They'll hurt your garden, they'll only interfere
With the vegetative growth that lasts about two months to a year
When full grown flowers bloom big buds and leaves
Watch out for thieves
People like to stash shit up their sleeves
It's not been three months
I'm tempted to break off a piece and roll some blunts
I wonder what it is, is this some Skunk?
I see some purple stems and orange hairs
Could it be the Humble mixed with Maui? It's a hybrid
Wow! Look what I did
I got the green thumb
Observe the superb herb
Bushy branches, loud smell
Like green pastel
I got it on deck for all seasons
And if anyone asks, it's for medical reasons
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 		

It's been over four months, time to get high
Uproot the plants and let them hang dry
In a cool room with dry air, for 2 to 3 weeks
And I'ma be waitin right here with my loose leaf sheets
The lovely harvest, it came in different amounts
Four trees, each one just a few grams short of an ounce
I can't wait to smoke it, I know it's the bomb
Been waiting so long, make me wanna write a song
I guess I'll sell 2 ounces and puff on the rest
Find a recipe to sprinkle herb on my filet of chicken breast
Or some tea shot full of THC
Hit the bomb, cut open the swisher sweet
Then come off on weed
Plant stuck to my fingertips as I try to break it down
And when lit, the fruity herby taste is profound
It have me buzzin for a light year, and you best believe I'll have some seeds
And be at it again, yes indeed
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope

It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you (we do it nasty, nasty)

[Warren G]
I once knew a girl named LaShonda
Short little cute thing
With a pinky diamond ring
She was iceless
My game was so priceless
Givin her a facial
I was G'd up
From the feed up
Pushin the bent
With the midnight tint
Huh, heaven sent

[Mista Grimm]
I once met a girl in the valley and
Half black half Italian
Ass like a stalian
Coke bottles shake
As she likes to watch herself on tape
Breakin nuts shake, but wait there's more
She keeps my nuts in her mouth like a squirrel
Pranksta with a pearl
Held my balls so long
I call trouble when I'm with my girl

[Warren G]
There's a law for that
We ain't trippin, we hogs for that
Uh

[Hook: Warren G and LaToiya - repeat 4X]
It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you
(we do it nasty, nasty)

[Damone]
I met this Puerto Rican named Sehonnie
She was as bad as Carmen
Chillin in New York and I cracked her in Spanish Harlem
Straight dime
Body bangin like a baseline
And the face fine
I had to spit dip waste time
Mr. Passionate
Everything her body was immaculin
The presence like a gift to men and got packaged

[Boss Hogg]
Fuckin fabolous
She say "damn he fat"
Then I still fuck the ass (how you do that)
Push up on 'em till they fall to the plot, damn it
Uh, hog 'em while they fuckin roll, goddamn it
Call me fat boy with a fat dick to mash
To lick me baby and I might lick you back

[Damone]
Lickin you back
She's gaggin with a dick in her trap
And stickin is fat
I'll pull it out and tickle your cat

[previous Hook]

[Warren G]
I put the smash on her like Shaq
She want the cash on her
I ain't havin that
You need to check yo' trap
I got rose cap
G'd up, 213, please believe that

[Mista Grimm]
I stay pimpin in a bubble I Benz
With hoes stubbled up and cuddled in the back with my friends
I slide up on 'em like a cross fader
The hook up later
And serve this dick like a waitor
I ain't tryna date her

[Damone]
When it comes to bitches
I got more game than the olympics
I get up in their mind and analyze and twist this, psychology
For no reason I'm recievin apologies
Break her down mentally
Have her stockin and follow me

[Boss Hogg]
Trick be swallowin me
For a nine on the vein
Cuz I'm the fuckin boss, she's my employee
I ain't hatin, I appreciate you freaky ass style
Yo nasty ass ?, eat a dick and smile

[previous Hook] - 2X(What goes up
	Must come down --] Biz Markie )

[ VERSE 1 ]
MC's - you need deeper concentration
Cause wack rhymes and crews lead to non-profit organizations
I attack like anxiety with the variety
]From the western society - baby
Seeing is believing, but looks can be deceiving
You might think you're coming with it, nigga, but you're leaving
With lyrics I'm conceiving
Morning, afternoon and evening
You can't wait
My shit's special like a .38
(You got a problem?)
I smoke some boo boo, now I'm spaced out like astrology
Getting in MC's asses like proctology
It's seems that everybody's going through a phase
Thinkin they can bust, but they're weak like 7 days
All 12 months for every ounce I get 12 blunts
Get the munchies, eat up 12 MC's at once
Thinkin that they wasn't, when they know that they was
The one with the style young, they still got the peachfuzz

	(What goes up
	Must come down)
	(What goes up...)
	(MC's) (...must come down)

[ VERSE 2 ]
When I get stoned like Fred Flint I begin
To smoke MC's like Marian, bury them
Cause most be comin unnatural like a cesarean
I wish my rhymes were meat and MC's were vegetarians
Cause when it comes to biting, I don't condone it
Besides, you couldn't manage my style if you owned it
I got gruesome rhymes in my mind
And they'll jump on a beat
Infect it when the rhyme is injected
Metaphors are connected
Booty lyrics are deflected
And the mic is intercepted
Cause I never ever leave it neglected
I'm tryina hold my position
What kind of man would I be if my rhymes weren't in mint condidtion
They say "(Hey) Grimm's nowhere to be found"
But they catch me on camera beatin MC's down
Always tryin to ponder what I'm pondering
They need to find theyself, because they're somewhere lost and wandering

	(What goes up
	Must come down)
	(What goes up...)
	(MC's) (...must come down)

[ VERSE 3 ]
As we mix a little lyric and track
Like coke and cognac
Premium blend
You're gonna need a driver, designated friend
Cause I intend to seep in your system
Hit hard, make MC's change agenda
Disregard their rhymes, return to sender
I got soul like Dr. Scholl eatin a bowl of neckbones
I like my shit loud enough to where it blows your headphones
If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys makin hits
Assassination other crews, posses, and clicks
The main thing's to get down and say my peace
Whoever disrespects, I'm Rushen like Patrice
I'll never cease with the funky, funky vocals and beats
Cause we need more rappers around flauntin new styles and speaks
I know we're amped to get the money, cause we need it
But if your lyrics ain't tight, the whole purpose is defeated
You can't shine and be on top with the wack sound
It's time to watch all the burnt out stars hit the groundArtist: Mista Grimm f/ Val Young
Album: Higher Learning Sdtk
Song: Situation: Grimm

(Val Young)
All the hustlers in the house better recognize
All the players in the house better recognize that
Things are looking grimm

Verse1
It was a cold dark night full moon shining bright
Rain showers wind blowin' at 90 miles an hour
I could barely see my shadow
Sparked up a fat ol' Philly
As fat as free Willy really
It's kind of chilly in my brain
Rappers get nightmares like Dana Dane man
This type scares optometrist
Plain and simple it's all mind and wrist
On a tempt Oh my goodness could this
Be the format where I'm at
In the abyss underground other sound
Top ten list-erine just to keep my vocals cleanest
Meanest you ever seen this incredible like the Hulk
I stay awoke alphabetical twista mista
With a rap book guaranteed to leave a
Gloomy outlook

Chorus (Val Young)
All the hustlers in the house better recognize
That things are looking grimm
All the players in the house better recognize
That things are looking grimm

Verse2
Oh boy watch me throw the bomb like Troy Aikman
And knock out eight men
Goddamn shit it's miraculous
This mysterious immaculate
History makin' rap sheet on a beat
Leavin' niggas shakin' from follicle to feet
With funkanisms shining like a prism SPINK
Sparkling remarkably glowing as I think thought thunk
Conceived off the skunk but funk
Best believe that it stunk
Not your ordinary fragrance
Wash cleanse your mind with Grimm
Squash wash watch out now
Here's me hear me Smack
Check your eardrum
Is it intact in fact?
[Coughing] when?
Approximately when the situation's grimm

Chorus

Verse3
Normally I formally introduce afflawed
Not true and technique and stick to it
Magnifique unique eek what have we
Mathematics for attics that equal cavi
And then some then some MC's make 'em crumble
When I mumble cause I'm fly like a bumble
C-O-V-I-N-A on the western area
Niggas are sick like malaria
Never smoke rock cause it's deadly
I just stick to Indo smoke and the medleys
Steadily developing on the constant
Causing a heat wave like Linda Rhimestead
Can't we look at how I hook it and present
Proof how the mind was took and shook in past tense
For ladies and gents here's the invitation
[Things are looking grimm] (over last line)
One way ticket to a grimm situation

Chorus with ad libs until fade out
