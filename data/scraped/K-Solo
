[Hook]
The head banger, WHAT?
The head banger
Parrish Smith gettin wreck
The head banger

[Verse 1: Parrish Smith]
Ka-rank the boombox as my sound knock from blocks
As I chill, and bust grills you take snapshots
Of the maniac, dressed in black, carry round a strap
Kid you play me too close (slow down and catch a cap, POW!!)
Cause I don't play games, an outlaw like Jesse James
To hell with the bitches and the so-called fame (uh-huh)
Strictly biz to hard (kid yeah) as I climb charts
Bustin heads daily as I compose like Mozart
Just stand, say you're mad damn, why him?
ZL1 Targa, five-sixty Benz
I'm sinking mad deep no shorts and no sleep
I'm bugged like a tapped phone, hard like concrete
So get a GRIP and don't SLIP or catch a CLIP
From the infrared aimed at your head as I blast my TARGET
The Bozack, I rip up flows that
Make an MC stop and chill and say HE'S ALL THAT
Hardcore no R&B singer
Roll with the Hit Squad... down with the head banger

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
SURPRISE, you wonder where I've been, I've been workin
But sounds makin danger, and black birds chirpin
A real Damian, Omen possessed by the devil
You dig the rhythm, and I'll play the RUNNIN REBEL
Changed my style, so I can freak the funk
Yo pass the Philly, HIT SQUAD spark the blunt
I got the power, to ramshack a stadium
WUBBA WUBBA, even Judy Brown the Palladium
Yo, I'm from the Boondocks so I knows the flavor (yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I curse but now, I show behavior
EPMD, YO, is in this to win this
A brand new LP SO MIND YOUR BUSINESS
No jokin, I'm gettin paid fully
You wanna buy the cassette, stop by Sam Goody
YO WHERE'S MY HOODIE? I wanna be hard and cause some ruckus
Talk with the b-boy slang and blast some suckers
Walk like an Egyptian, rough crackin my steel
Plus I'm goin to court, make my own appeal
As taught as a kid or told, NEVER TALK TO A STRANGER
Cause I could be a head banger

[Hook]

[Verse 3: K-Solo]
I'm the original rap criminal (yeahhhhh)
My shots, spell spray (hoo-ahhhh) duck leaves my trigger finger DIGITAL
My gun'll make, many men, things you did when I get mad
And pissed cause I can make him my TARGET
Braggin em taggin em draggin em mad hollow-point rhymes in my mic
Choose Smith or assault over Magnum (huh)
So back up off me, here's a clip
For uzis and guns, and then you faggots gonna OFF ME
I'm sure you know the deal that my nine can box
I knock punks out quick like Evander Holyfield
More rhymes than music's, my solution
Subscribers of my style here's a contribution
Let's say you want a shovel layer parkin MC's like cars
And drivin MC's away
Tanks gon be full, to rappers wanna tempt me
I break the steering shift and leave em EMPTY
Cause they can't go, so I'mma call a ho tow truck
To come tow truck your weak SIDE SHOW
Back on the scene is the incredible one man team
When I get mad I turn GREEN
The Fugitive's gone peace, I'm outta here later
And here's a finger, to all you non movin spectators

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Redman]
SURPRISE NIGGAZ! The original P-Funk funks you up
I take a hit from a spliff then I get biz with the NEW CUT
Because I can Jam like Teddy if you let me
A Goodfella but still rugged like Joe PESCI
My style is mad funka-to-the-delic with the irrelevant
Shit that I kick backflips any four bitch (yeah)
Deduct and I dip then I SWITCH
To an incredible nigga with a *nickle* nine on the hip
I always got played by a honeyDIP
But now I'm on the money TIP so now I call the honeydip honey BITCH
And swing hardcore because that's where I come from (yeah)
I Rock ya like Chubb, and burn scrubs like a dum-dum
Remember Redman, last album I was Hardcore
Now I'm back to tear the frame out your assCRACK
Cause I get wreck, with the tec, with the blunt or moet
And what you see is what you get and what you're gettin is your
ASS KICKED, nigga, hit you with the funkdafied figure
Like A plus funk, funk times stuffed in your back trunk PUNK
Yes the Redman that's what they call me
Wicked with the style you think I have cerebral palsy

Lullaby your stupid ass, ROCKABYE BABY
The Funkadelic Devil hit your ass with a level from the new school
And still holdin my jewels!

[Hook 3x][Intro]
Due to technical dificulties beyond our control
Reggie Noble's stinkin ass will not be performing with us
[K-Solo]: Erick Sermon, keep keep it on
Def Squad, Erick Sermon, Redman keep keep it on
K to M Keith Murray keep keep it on
Keep keep on, ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
K-Solo, Redman, ya don't stop
Erick Sermon, Keith Murray ya don't stop

[Verse 1: K-Solo]
I X'd ya amateur, damage ya, have fools jumpin off
Cliffs grabbin their ass cheeks yellin Geronimo
It ain't a problem at all when K solve
Three-hundred and sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged, by my entourage, who put the Ram in Dodge
Bas cla in bumba claat
Maintain, few remain in the game
So I remain focused and pop's the main aim

[Verse 2: Redman]
Well it's the Funk Doctor Spock, the pon cock lyricist
My mentality's so def yo I ain't even hearin this shit
Biscuits be cockin back when I be coming
I guess they heard how I be takin MC's out by the hundreds
Wanted, for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist still trippin, thinkin
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us

[Verse 3: K-Solo]
Sprayed a few, shank a few, rap crews say they shamed too
But can't hang two, like we do
Fuck them, they better bow slow
This rhyme'll cold hit em, real quick cause I'm K-Solo
Battle any dude, this retifuge I'm in cruise
See what the better vet, could do, to you undouche
You three groups, four punkses at a time
I box two and knock em out at the drop of a dime

[Verse 4: Redman]
The long faced murderer
Servin over two billion motherfuckers a day like Mickey D's circular
Workin a shifty hour like a burgular
My crew herbin ya like we never even heard of ya
Odds are evens, that I'mma be the one creepin
My new niggas check the flows of the major deacon
The bazaar, the rap non-superstar
When I step up I pump volume like rah

[Verse 5: K-Solo]
My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees
So this makes me, the light skinned Richard Roundtree
Vocabularies very, loquacious
And gregarious, pump that too, go grab the dictionary
Fly word that we flip on the M-I-K-E mike
My crew be like, this style's hype
Wrong's the opposite forget the bullshhhh
To rhyme like the K-Solo, you need more than a soul kid

[Verse 6: Redman]
Come closer, while I lock it down like I'm supposed ta
You battle me, you won? You might of, but then you woke up
My turbulence will make peanut butter choke up
Call me tha Brick City, Stock Cock Broker
Y'all niggas is fools, playin with hood moves
You couldn't total my amount if you sung I Missed You
Dissed you dismissed you yeah I fixed you
Let your girl suck on the shit that I piss through

[Outro]
Haha... haha
Keep keep it on (5X)
Yo what we doin son?

[K-Solo]
I was in my room writing rhymes I H-A-D had
Next to my room was a laboratory run by my D-A-D dad
He was a professor, and I'm his S-O-N
So my life as a professor had just begun, my name is
K-E-V-I-N-M-A-D-I-S-O-N run the experiment I qualify
And become a good professor in medicine
I ran out my door, and I looked for
A breakbeat, spelling book, and grabbed my dog, "Woof!"
Rhymes that I had, every muscle from his body
The combination of that will give me strength, to rock a party
I thought that I might, get H-U-R-T hurt
If I used dad's melachalonin machine that was known to convert
No manual that I could find on dad's machine
I hit a button and this rumor turned the laboratory green
Some hairs was from my dog and a pair from mine
Hit the switch I spelled a rhyme the chromosome, will mix with mine
This uncanny combination will let the world understand
Professor Kevin Madison changed to the incredible Letterman!

YouknowhatI'msayin K-Solo in the house youknowhatI'msayin?
Pete Rock in effect with CL Smooth youknowhatI'msayin?
My man John on the board, ha hah
Hit Squad in effect, for nineteen-ninety-two
The L-E-T-T-E-R-M-A-N, youknowhatI'msayin?
And we out
Hakim in the houseYeah! Tell your moms to mind her business

Your mom's in my business, she's in my business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go"

When I first met your moms, I gave your mom respect
But now I see she knows me, I see that she suspects
I'm some bad guy, I don't know why
You have to tell your mother lies about you and I
But when your first told me, she said that I was a no-no
Cause of my haircut and people call me Solo
Before the time you said, you really didn't care
Now you tell me to change my name, or even cut my hair
How would you ever go become somebody's wife
And at the age of 22 you let your mother run your life?
Me, I'm not the type to tell your moms to get lost
Yell out loud to flip and get my point across
See I think you should tell your moms to leave us two alone
And stop reading our love letters and evesdropping on the phone
Cause if you really liked my, you'd let your mommy know
She gotta mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)

Remember your sister and her boyfriend Sam Seed?
Your momma's the real reason why your sister lost her man
Her and sam went together, for a real long time
But Sam controlled her body while your mom controlled her mind
Not saying she was hurt when your moms made 'em break up
Deep down I could tell, though, your sister wanted to make up
With Sam, because she wanted to become his wife
And now she can't do that because your mother runs her life
You baby, you do the same things, too
You always want to to the crazy things your mommy wants you to do
Like when we went to the movie, she had to come along
I went back and forth and forth and back for peanuts and popcorn
She took advantage, cause I was living fat
I couldn't even watch the movie, she kept me running back
For something that she wanted somewhere else in the store
I walked and got it all til the man said there's no more
And when I got back to the car, she took her time to move over
When I sat in the car, my movie was like over
I was mad, hurt, I didn't want to talk
Deep down I wanted you and your mommy both to walk
I took you home anyway, like what the heck
Cause I was raised to treat people's mothers with respect
But when we got to your home, we wasn't left alone
She waited there in the car with us until I headed home
You called me on the phone, saying you were alone
But that's a lie because I heard your moms breathing on the phone
And if you really like me, let your moms know
She should mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)

Without a doubt, me, like when I come to your house
She'll ask me crazy questions and start looking in my mouth
Her friends start laughing and I feel just like a jerk
I told 'em I don't know where my mom and dad work
I really know where they work, but that's between them and me
I can't be putting mom and dad's business in the street
Cause if I told her that my family both work for the state
Right after that she would've asked me how much money do they make
Then she'd go around the town, bragging and boasting
Telling the neighborhood what my family's grossing
Your moms, your moms, why is she so nosey?
She plays me like a game but I'm no ring-around-the-rosey
I even seen your dad at the family barbeque
He said "I don't see nothing wrong with my daugher seeing you"
But it's your wife mister, she don't think that I'm charming
She thinks she's Mr. Whippit and she thinks I'll squeeze her Charmin
I promise I won't do this to your daugher, calm man
Cause when I'm with girls, my reputation is not harming
If I'm not on tour, I'm working out at my house
I'll pick your daugher up sometime, and I'll even take her out
And every time I try to do this, I see without a doubt
Your wife will follow me around like a cop on a stakeout
And when I told the man that, I thought he would help me out
Til he said "I can't tell her nothing, she'll kick me out the house"
See, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls
Mothers love you, and they're concerned
But if you don't solve your own problems, then how can you learn?
And guys, if you're in a relationship like this
Don't be afraid to tell your girlfriend tell your moms to mind her business
But after me and you girl, I'd rather stay Solo
Because your moms can't mind her business, I'm a have to let you go
Because your mom is in my business

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)

Out, 1990, K-SoloI ran like a rebel, in '85
Cops tried to catch me, cause all of 'em said I
Beat up these other men who were bigger than me
Was it cause I'm black and they were W-H-I-T-E
Here I was walking down the block
I seen these two big bikers standing by the biker's shop
They seen it was me so to make theyself feel bigger
One got bad, bold, pointed and called me a nigger
I stuck my finger up, I said "His mother" and kept stepping
His friend told his other friend "Hey Corky let's get him"
I looked to my back, to my surprise
One had a chain in his hand and the devil in his eye
I said "I'm in trouble, let me think real quick"
I looked down at the ground and got this big fat brick
With no time to waste I put the brick in my hand
And hit the biker til the chain fell out of his hand
Then his friend Crowty said "Corky are you alright?"
But what he didn't know was he was in for a fight
The right his his jaw, he fell on the floor
The kid I hit with the brick before said "Don't hit him any more"
I put my brick down, left him on the ground
Everything was cool til the cops came around
They said "You're under arrest for Assault 2 and 3"
I laughed at the cop I said "Explain this to me"
He said "You hit the man with a brick and punched another in the jaw
And left the scene like nothing happened then they called the law"
I laughed in his face, I said "This don't make sense"
It was two against my black ass, this makes it self-defence
He tried to grab me, so I pushed him on the floor
And ran my black ass home and locked the living room door
I did what any black kid would have did
But to the cops of Suffolk County, I'm known as a fugitive

I had to go to school, I couldn't be late
If I miss another day Miss Cann said I wouldn't graduate
I didn't go a lot, that didn't mean I didn't care
I had to come to school more often to try again next year
Fuck that, I went to school and I tried
You know to hide from the cops to June of '85
I get my diploma and things would be straight
Find out my graduation cops came and tried to put me on the gate
I ran though, with the diploma that I owned
With cops chasing me all the way til I got home
I got away again, why, you know what I did?
I ran my black ass home and to them I'm still a fugitive

Two years went by, me running from the cops
My mom looked at my dad, my dad said "Son, this has gotta stop"
Dad gave Ma money, she said, "Son, this is for ya"
I went to Garden City to go get me a lawyer
I went to jail, Monday, I was in jail through Friday
When you're black and you're in trouble man does your lawyer get paid
Then my moms told the judge "My son's a good child"
Then he laughed at my mother and said "Then take us to trial"
I told my mom and dad I felt within
If we took Suffolk County to court or trial, I know I wouldn't win
So without a doubt, like any black kid in Suffolk County
K-S-O-L-O had to cop out
To sixteen months in Riverhead
Instead of fighting and wilding, I wrote my records instead
Commissary was books, inmates owed me
CO's would beat me up on shakedowns, but now those suckers know me
And I laugh at those cops who arrest me for what I did
Cause I walked and no longer am I a fugitive[K-Solo] Break it down!
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Yeah!
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Lies and rumors, rumors and lies
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Lies and rumors, rumors and lies
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)

Verse One: K-Solo

Who's spreadin all the rumors, who's tellin all the lies?
Solo fell off? You must be drinkin St. Ide's
I'm back in effect on my second cassette
Check the untouched rep, scarin emcees like a bomb threat
Rumors and lies, at the same time try to destroy my name
Is this the price for fame?
If people got money, for rumors and talk
They'd have a lot of millionaires livin here in New York
Three number one hits, should kill the negative vibe
Solo's name and fame could never be denied
It's got me trapped in a corner and I wanna attack
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Two: K-Solo

I wrote 'Spellbound', to put my face on the map
But rumors have it that another man laid in jail wrote
That's impossible, Kevin Madison will take a stand
If he wrote 'Spellbound', who the hell wrote 'Letterman'?
Mission to make the non-believers there become a witness
When I release the hit, "Tell your moms ta mind her bizness"
It went number two, not far from number one
While the fugitive ran, I came back, to get the job done
Now they wanna tell lies, and take credit from a great
Hard working Solo artist, but this'll set em straight
I came back for ninety-two on a Sam Sneed track
I tried to hold it all in, but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Three: K-Solo

Cops won't arrest me, before, but now I'm on a tour
So what they knockin at my mother's door for?
The cash made I received, the money I was worth
But Solo couldn't change, cause I was taught first
To remember who you are, and where you come from
It won't be hard for you to become, number one
I don't like crowds around me ever, only a true friend
Can become an enemy so I stay Solo forever
I like it that way, but I hate when people say
Put me down on their record, so I can get paid
If I bring crews and other emcees on stage
And help everybody else, I never stay paid
So I write rhymes for Solo, and help myself
So when I get there, I can give another brother help
Kevin Solo demonstration left others and that's that
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Four: K-Solo

Now I got a new album, and a tape and a CD
And those who thought I fell off were really surprised to see
K-S-O-L-O throwin down and all the rumors
And the lies that they were spreadin couldn't keep me down!
Back out my face, keep my name out your mouth
This record got your cornered and there's no way out
Solo killed all the rumors cause I had to attack
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)

Album: Tell the World My Name
Song: Tales From the Crack Side

Tales From The Crack Side
Tales From The Crack Side
Tales From The Crack Side

I woke up in the morning, on a regular day
I knew my man named R, would be around my way
I brushed my hair, my teeth, suddenly I washed my face
Then he came over my house with the drug base
He kept saying if I take one hit of a pipe
I write records to rhyme before the rest of the night
I said, "R, I don't do drugs, or drugs are whack"
And ain't that base drug like a drug, CRACK
He said no Solo, see base is the shit
Girls puff of base, and everybody does it
He left off quick and left me the base and the pipe
And I thought I write a record a rhyme, before I reach night
I said if that's true, but any case
I couldn't wait to write my record after I smoke the base
He left the crib, I heard the telephone
It was my mom telling to watch my sister 'till she gets home
I hung up the phone, with no time to waste
I put my sister in the kitchen so I could smoke the base
It had a funny taste but it didn't taste bad I felt hot
That's when I got my pen and pad
I wrote a rhyme it was funky
I broke in a race
Cause the rhy that I wrote, tried to run off my page
I said, "Stop rhyme"
Then I grabbbed the rhyme and cut the rhyme
That I've seen running in my sight
I got a mind was happy when I thought the rhyme was dead
Some leaf swong and caught me square on the head
I fell on my floor and
The rhyme grabbed the knife
And cut my little sister
I thought it took her life
She fell on the floor, blood covered the rug
The rhyme was left and to my surprise I knew something was bugged
I got on the phone to call the cops, "what should I do?"
You'd did the same thing if you was in my shoes
As I started talking I seen the rhyme run by
And hit me with a can of ravioli in my eye
I fell on the floor look and when my vision cleared
I looked around the house and see the rhyme disappeared
I started to cry I said, "Oh, what would my mom say?"
That's when I heard a cop pulled up into the driveway
She came in the house she took a look at the place
See my sister still bleeding the knife and the base
She said, "You cut your sister while you were smoking that shit"
I said, "Mom, I didn't cut 'er, the rhyme did it"
I knew this was the truth, mom thought it was a lie
Some of y'll might even think it's just a Tale From The Crack Side

A Tale From The Crack Side
A Tale From The Crack Side

Mom was crying, she ran in shocked
Got on the phone, and then she started crying to the cops
So I ran out the door, and I looked for
The rhyme that cut my sister, who bled on my floor
I got in the yard, went out ran out in the street
I had to duck behind some trees cause I seen the police
When they ran in my house and shut up the block
I see my girl far coming to my house, and my jaw dropped
I said, "Baby stop," but yo she kept on walking
I knew pretty soon, the cops would be hawking
I never knew the trouble I was really headed for
'Till the rhyme appeared again dressed in Santa Claus
He said, "Ho Ho Ho baby you look great"
And told me dead on my face my girl was gonna get raped
Me watching this whole thing it was blowing my mind
Cause my girl was getting raped by this musical rhyme
He was sliding in fast my girl cried for help
I grabbed a stick, you know and Solo went for self
I hit the rhyme in the head and seen him drop
But hen the rhyme disappeared and all I seen was cops
They were coming for me fast I couldn't escape
Besides my girl was on the ground butt-naked yelling and raped
One cop gave 'er a coat and said "M.s are you alright?"
Another cop said that's the kid that cut his sister with the knife
I told them my name, I tried to explain
They heard the side of my story
They said "Boy you insane" you raped this girl too
Come on and just admit it
I said, "Man, I didn't rape 'her, the rhyme did it"
I knew this was the truth but cops thought it was a lie
Some of y'll might even think it just a Tale From The Crack Side

A Tale From The Crack Side
A Tale From The Crack Side
A Tale From The Crack Side

The cops tried to catch me, so I ran like hell
I needed someone to talk to, someone to tell
Cause all these things were happening they where blowing my mind
See, I knew I didn't do this, I knew it was a rhyme
But who would believe me in any high state of mind
If they ask me who did it, and I say it was a rhyme
The cops didn't buy it, this is why I 'm being chased
Then my mom told the cops that I was high, on base
I'm running I'm sweating
I suddenly knew that I had to get the piece out as fast as I can, so
I shoot up this corner, run up another block
Looked over my shoulders, and seen I lost the cops, then
I ran to his door, bang like a ring or two
He said "Solo, hey man the cops are looking for you"
I said, "Thanks to you the base and that pipe"
"I wrote a rhyme high last night and the rhyme came alive"
He started to laugh, said "Yeah right!"
I said, "It raped my girl on the block, and cut my sister with a knife"
He started laughing, he thought it was a joke
He said, "Yo Solo you had a little too much to smoke"
I grabbed him in the jaw, we started fighting on the floor
Suddenly that's when I heard someone that was coming from the door
To conclusion, enter my mind, I said
"Could it be the cops, or the rhyme"
But before when I told 'em my man pay me no mind
And when the door opened up, it came the rhyme
With a hammer in his hand he tried to hit me in the head
I ducked, but the hammer hit P instead
I started braeking then, I said this must be a nightmare
He was screaming on the floor and there was blood everywhere
I got on the phone, called the cops
She went into shock
And when I hung up the phone, cops was on the block
I stuck my head out the door, said, "Help me the rhyme is in here"
But then he dropped the hammer, again he disappeared
The cops kept asking me how did he get hit
I kept trying to tell the cops "Yo, the rhyme did it"
They didn't' buy it, they said "Boy you're bug"
"You can save that rhyme story, for the lawyer or the judge"
I get there the D.A. and judge still wouldn't listen
They gave me fifteen to twenty-five years in prision
They take me somewhere, far state
For attempted murder, assault too and rape
My family won't talk to me, my friends won't' see me
My girl now hates me, and she don't wanna marry me
Cause when this all dawned on me
It wasn't a rhyme it was just base technique
So I tell kids and adults in this place
This could happen to y'll if y'll smoke crack or base
So do yourself a favor stay away from this
Or you'll be in jail like I was yelling the rhyme did it
No one will believe you, they'll think you're telling a lie
And your life will become another, Tale From The Crack Side

Tale From The Crack Side
Tale From The Crack Side
Tale From The Crack Side
PMD, word up
Tom J, I'm outI ran like a rebel, in '85
Cops tried to catch me, cause all of 'em said I
Beat up these other men who were bigger than me
Was it cause I'm black and they were W-H-I-T-E
Here I was walking down the block
I seen these two big bikers standing by the biker's shop
They seen it was me so to make theyself feel bigger
One got bad, bold, pointed and called me a nigger
I stuck my finger up, I said "His mother" and kept stepping
His friend told his other friend "Hey Corky let's get him"
I looked to my back, to my surprise
One had a chain in his hand and the devil in his eye
I said "I'm in trouble, let me think real quick"
I looked down at the ground and got this big fat brick
With no time to waste I put the brick in my hand
And hit the biker til the chain fell out of his hand
Then his friend Crowty said "Corky are you alright?"
But what he didn't know was he was in for a fight
The right his his jaw, he fell on the floor
The kid I hit with the brick before said "Don't hit him any more"
I put my brick down, left him on the ground
Everything was cool til the cops came around
They said "You're under arrest for Assault 2 and 3"
I laughed at the cop I said "Explain this to me"
He said "You hit the man with a brick and punched another in the jaw
And left the scene like nothing happened then they called the law"
I laughed in his face, I said "This don't make sense"
It was two against my black ass, this makes it self-defence
He tried to grab me, so I pushed him on the floor
And ran my black ass home and locked the living room door
I did what any black kid would have did
But to the cops of Suffolk County, I'm known as a fugitive

I had to go to school, I couldn't be late
If I miss another day Miss Cann said I wouldn't graduate
I didn't go a lot, that didn't mean I didn't care
I had to come to school more often to try again next year
Fuck that, I went to school and I tried
You know to hide from the cops to June of '85
I get my diploma and things would be straight
Find out my graduation cops came and tried to put me on the gate
I ran though, with the diploma that I owned
With cops chasing me all the way til I got home
I got away again, why, you know what I did?
I ran my black ass home and to them I'm still a fugitive

Two years went by, me running from the cops
My mom looked at my dad, my dad said "Son, this has gotta stop"
Dad gave Ma money, she said, "Son, this is for ya"
I went to Garden City to go get me a lawyer
I went to jail, Monday, I was in jail through Friday
When you're black and you're in trouble man does your lawyer get paid
Then my moms told the judge "My son's a good child"
Then he laughed at my mother and said "Then take us to trial"
I told my mom and dad I felt within
If we took Suffolk County to court or trial, I know I wouldn't win
So without a doubt, like any black kid in Suffolk County
K-S-O-L-O had to cop out
To sixteen months in Riverhead
Instead of fighting and wilding, I wrote my records instead
Commissary was books, inmates owed me
CO's would beat me up on shakedowns, but now those suckers know me
And I laugh at those cops who arrest me for what I did
Cause I walked and no longer am I a fugitive[Redman]
Negroes!!!!!!!!

[Hook]
The head banger, WHAT?
The head banger
Parrish Smith gettin wreck
The head banger

[Verse 1: Parrish Smith]
Ka-rank the boombox as my sound knock from blocks
As I chill, and bust grills you take snapshots
Of the maniac, dressed in black, carry round a strap
Kid you play me too close (slow down and catch a cap, POW!!)
Cause I don't play games, an outlaw like Jesse James
To hell with the bitches and the so-called fame (uh-huh)
Strictly biz to hard (kid yeah) as I climb charts
Bustin heads daily as I compose like Mozart
Just stand, say you're mad damn, why him?
ZL1 Targa, five-sixty Benz
I'm sinking mad deep no shorts and no sleep
I'm bugged like a tapped phone, hard like concrete
So get a GRIP and don't SLIP or catch a CLIP
From the infrared aimed at your head as I blast my TARGET
The Bozack, I rip up flows that
Make an MC stop and chill and say HE'S ALL THAT
Hardcore no R&B singer
Roll with the Hit Squad... down with the head banger

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
SURPRISE, you wonder where I've been, I've been workin
But sounds makin danger, and black birds chirpin
A real Damian, Omen possessed by the devil
You dig the rhythm, and I'll play the RUNNIN REBEL
Changed my style, so I can freak the funk
Yo pass the Philly, HIT SQUAD spark the blunt
I got the power, to ramshack a stadium
WUBBA WUBBA, even Judy Brown the Palladium
Yo, I'm from the Boondocks so I knows the flavor (yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I curse but now, I show behavior
EPMD, YO, is in this to win this
A brand new LP SO MIND YOUR BUSINESS
No jokin, I'm gettin paid fully
You wanna buy the cassette, stop by Sam Goody
YO WHERE'S MY HOODIE? I wanna be hard and cause some ruckus
Talk with the b-boy slang and blast some suckers
Walk like an Egyptian, rough crackin my steel
Plus I'm goin to court, make my own appeal
As taught as a kid or told, NEVER TALK TO A STRANGER
Cause I could be a head banger

[Hook]

[Verse 3: K-Solo]
I'm the original rap criminal (yeahhhhh)

And pissed cause I can make him my TARGET
Braggin em taggin em draggin em mad hollow-point rhymes in my mic
Choose Smith or assault over Magnum (huh)
So back up off me, here's a clip
For uzis and guns, and then you faggots gonna OFF ME

I knock punks out quick like Evander Holyfield
More rhymes than music's, my solution
Subscribers of my style here's a contribution
Let's say you want a shovel layer parkin MC's like cars
And drivin MC's away
Tanks gon be full, to rappers wanna tempt me
I break the steering shift and leave em EMPTY
Cause they can't go, so I'mma call a ho tow truck
To come tow truck your weak SIDE SHOW
Back on the scene is the incredible one man team
When I get mad I turn GREEN
The Fugitive's gone peace, I'm outta here later
And here's a finger, to all you non movin spectators

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Redman]
SURPRISE NIGGAZ! The original P-Funk funks you up

Lullaby your stupid ass, ROCKABYE BABY
The Funkadelic Devil hit your ass with a level from the new school
And still holdin my jewels!

[Hook 3x][Intro]
Due to technical dificulties beyond our control
Reggie Noble's stinkin ass will not be performing with us
[K-Solo]: Erick Sermon, keep keep it on
Def Squad, Erick Sermon, Redman keep keep it on
K to M Keith Murray keep keep it on
Keep keep on, ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
K-Solo, Redman, ya don't stop
Erick Sermon, Keith Murray ya don't stop

[Verse 1: K-Solo]
I X'd ya amateur, damage ya, have fools jumpin off
Cliffs grabbin their ass cheeks yellin Geronimo
It ain't a problem at all when K solve
Three-hundred and sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged, by my entourage, who put the Ram in Dodge
Bas cla in bumba claat
Maintain, few remain in the game
So I remain focused and pop's the main aim

[Verse 2: Redman]
Well it's the Funk Doctor Spock, the pon cock lyricist
My mentality's so def yo I ain't even hearin this shit
Biscuits be cockin back when I be coming
I guess they heard how I be takin MC's out by the hundreds
Wanted, for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist still trippin, thinkin
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us

[Verse 3: K-Solo]
Sprayed a few, shank a few, rap crews say they shamed too
But can't hang two, like we do
Fuck them, they better bow slow
This rhyme'll cold hit em, real quick cause I'm K-Solo
Battle any dude, this retifuge I'm in cruise
See what the better vet, could do, to you undouche
You three groups, four punkses at a time
I box two and knock em out at the drop of a dime

[Verse 4: Redman]
The long faced murderer
Servin over two billion motherfuckers a day like Mickey D's circular
Workin a shifty hour like a burgular
My crew herbin ya like we never even heard of ya
Odds are evens, that I'mma be the one creepin
My new niggas check the flows of the major deacon
The bazaar, the rap non-superstar
When I step up I pump volume like rah

[Verse 5: K-Solo]
My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees
So this makes me, the light skinned Richard Roundtree
Vocabularies very, loquacious
And gregarious, pump that too, go grab the dictionary
Fly word that we flip on the M-I-K-E mike
My crew be like, this style's hype
Wrong's the opposite forget the bullshhhh
To rhyme like the K-Solo, you need more than a soul kid

[Verse 6: Redman]
Come closer, while I lock it down like I'm supposed ta
You battle me, you won? You might of, but then you woke up
My turbulence will make peanut butter choke up
Call me tha Brick City, Stock Cock Broker
Y'all niggas is fools, playin with hood moves
You couldn't total my amount if you sung I Missed You
Dissed you dismissed you yeah I fixed you
Let your girl suck on the shit that I piss through

[Outro]
Haha... haha
Keep keep it on (5X)
Yo what we doin son?
Knockin niggas the fuck out!![Erick Sermon]
Yo, and special guests on my show
Is the K

[K-Solo]
To the S to the O-L-O

[Parrish Smith]
And me, the capital D, the O to C
The a.k.a., the P the M the D

[Erick Sermon]
And me, the E to the D to the O
To the U to the B to the L to the E

[K-Solo]
It's time P

[Parrish Smith]
To rip the M the I to C

[Erick Sermon]
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
K-Solo (yo) I pass P the microphone

[Parrish Smith]
Nah black (why P?) to each his own
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass E the microphone

[Erick Sermon]
It's me, yes the MC Grand Royal
Who loves rappin, and to it I stay loyal
I can't tell, you ain't caught up in my spell
You dwell on the other crab MC's that fell
Apart from the start, that didn't know the art
Of rappin, to keep the people's hands clappin
But it's me, I know the way it should be
The flow slow, like me and PMD
And that black, will make you real fat
A real swinger, and a real cool cat
Like a jazz player, or someone on the accordion
Producing crazy hits like, if I was Barry Gordy and
Here's a tip, to show you how to rip
A crab in half, and watch his posse flip
So me, the E, I come equipped
Heavy ammunition, so I don't have to dip
So listen, to this funky fresh lesson
The way I drop it, and the way that I was flexin
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
PMD (yo) I pass Solo the microphone

[K-Solo]
Yo I pass (why Solo?) to each his own
Yo knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Yo, I pass P the microphone

[Parrish Smith]
As I take the stage, with the fresh dipped gear
I start to show off, with throw your hands in the air
Because the older I get, the harder I kick
Usin my rap-fu style from a rap-fu flick
Of my Bic oh shit another MC's lit
Like a Jack-o-Lantern, on the Halloween tip
Cause as the bass thumps, VU meters peaks
All pens and pads are drawn, as the teacher speaks
Because a naughty rapper, tried to steal the flow
But the buck stops here, cause I'mma let you know
No swingin, or knuckles, strictly ammo
Cause as I dust bust, crush, and then rush
A sucker new jack, with no if's and's or but's
You roll with the good times, we like to roll with Rush
I drive a 'Ratti (I drives a Benz) you ride the bus
So get out the mustard, crab, because it's time to catch-up
And in the act of war, P refuse to let up
On a gonna-be, wanna-be, soon-to-be, whatever's clever
In any type of weather, cause two birds of a feather
Always flock together
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
K-Solo, I pass E the microphone

[Erick Sermon]
I pass (why E? To each his own)
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass Solo the microphone

[K-Solo]
Yo, my style's aggressive, like a pit bull terrier
Harder it sounds on wax, the more the merrier
Maestro though, releases beats for me
So I can rig up a hit and get paid easily
People, gather round listen to flow
Yo, so I can prove, that I'm the true Solo
Too many suckers, have bit my name in vain
Punk rappers thought I was sleepin, but Solo came
To so many places, other rappers faces
That called theirself Solo, I made em erase it
I'm Solo, no name lender or pretender
Yo, I am the Solo the on-ly solo contender
Duck MC's, grab my name and bit it boldly
Put it behind they name and ate this up like ravioli
I heard on KISS, with Red Alert and Chuck
A rapper said he went Solo, I said, "What the FUCK??!"
My man came over, and said, "Yo, I thought we heard you"
Joke's on you you heard a bitin ass crew
They bit my name, I want it back, and it's a fact
Yo PMD tell em (damn you shouldn'ta did that)
Now for the record, what do I stand for
One lonely rapper on the stage, who gets one, single applause
Give me a break my brother
My name stands for Kevin Self, Organization Left Others
My name's no game for those who claim to use my name
In vain cause their name sounds plain
I remain the same, my flow of style won't change yo
The name of the game is for the real Solo to explain
I don't know was where you ran or came
I know your vein I hate your name
You're ashamed, playin the game that drove you insane
That walk around puddles, snow and the rain
With a cane, nothin to gain but shame
And my momentum of the fast flow of rhyme'll get em tamed
The pain of no fame, no title again, nobody but the real
K-S-O-L-O to blame
When I S-P-E, L-L, very W-E, L-L
People all out there can T-E-L-L
Rhymes that I got, or write will S-E-L-L
For those who don't believe me, can go to H-E-L-L
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Like a B-R-I-D, in the S-K-Y
Don't even T-O-Y to be dat's why
L-I-N-E's belong to M-I-N-E
I'm makin veche, some rappers imitate
Yo f*ck it, Solo here's to make parties sway
People, I won't take any kind of losses
Battlin rappers grabbin the mic and usin resources
Like household utensils, kitchen appliances (becoming silent and fading away)[Hook]

They just rappers I'm a cloud of galactic matter comin' at ya
Like radar or race car spelt backwards
The mirror image of the emperor's lyrics
Concubines are forbidden to compare it until I finish
The magnetic patient will record the same thing
While erasin' the lost dynasty of Beijing
Spittin' rhymes cause significant mission lapse time
You'll be fine, don't rewind; move onto the next line
Three bogies ten O'clock high, I die if I do not try
Ostriches are not supposed to fly
Fighter pilots with no eyelids
Did you see what I just did?
Hydraulic pressure gettin' as high as a bitch
Textbook vertical spin, landed on the wing, I'm in
The evil bald Eagle strike you again
Yuri Gagarin, I met him when we he came to Heaven

Start at your head, I end it quick and end your ass
Send your career on a collision course; then you'll crash

You'll hit a tree and you go flyin' through your window headfirst
Foes come in the white mink, leave in the red fur
Get your fuckin' ass kicked, leave with your head hurt
Beef with me equals dead thugs
Even when I'm fuckin' sleep, stomp out you bedbugs
The Hitman buck quick
One thing I can't stand in this rap game is a bitch ass who suck dick
Rap too good for the hood, who's the don
And they said I'd never make it with a help from you know who
But I proved them wrong
Even without money in my pocket I still move along
And I'm happy Canibus got me to do this song
I was never assed out; my label's the only label
And the mothafuckin' world is able to take the trash out
Call me sweet, Big Kevin I fuck a bitch 'til she pass out
I got hands too when I cum, a lot of niggas don't wanna back out
Dirty niggas, they gon' pull a mac out
Cause I rap grapple and box, make competition tap out
I put it down; I cut them down, cut them down
You know I'm known to shut them down
Dudes is jokin', I laugh, take cash cause they clowns
If they got beef with that I get Canibus to spray the rounds
Take them down; I'm the Godfather, Long Island music here to take the crown
Breeze through, enemies quiet, they don't make a sound
Get a bucket of red blood, paint the town
I'm a beast, when I walk I shake the ground
Who hatin' now? Who hatin' now? Who hatin' now?Black America, tell me who's killing who?

Black America
Killing each others
Dying in the hands of the young black sisters and brothers
They're killing their own race
Go anywhere in black america and you'll see that's only face
To watch Black America cry, no one see no one, DIE
I blow this delight to keep'em alive
We've got to change the reflexions of the majority
You look in the mirror of Black America
Tell me who's killing who?

Drug dealers are doin' the cherry in our community
Destroy Black America, brother where's your unity ?
And see throughout the subject that we must talk about
That we can point the Black America that sells drugs to
A kid who don't even know her mom's your biggest customer
They're home starving cause you're always selling drugs to her
And what did you do with the money?
You went and bought mo' drugs so you can make mo' money
And kill the hope and dreams right in Black America eyes
Lettin' the few to know that drug is a way to survive
If you don't respect one another then help one another
Will destroy one another and that's what they want my brother
You killing me, and I'm killing you
Now stop and ask yourself how can the black dream come true
We got to change the reflexions of the majority
You view in the mirror of mirror of Black America
Tell me who's killing who?

Black man gotta stop calling the women a bitch
You're mother is a black woman too
So that's make you a son of a bitch
This is the wrong word to use my brother
That same word kept our black women back in the gutter
Nobody was there to pick a black lady up
In Black America, where time is rough
U didn't care and it went away cause she was that to you
My point is Black America
Tell me who's killing who?

We fought together, lived together
And if we don't get it together we all die together
Cause all we got is each other
Black american girls and boys and black fathers and mothers
Get involved with the children, it starts at home
The Black America we save, could be our own
We gotta change the reflexions of the majority
You view in the mirror of Black America
Tell me who's killing who?

Black America tell me, who's killing who?
Killing me, killing you, killing you
(5X)Yeah

You know what I'm sayin?
K-Solo back in effect
1992
K-Solo steppin back in here

Check it out
Household Maid
'92

Yo, Red
You know what I'm sayin?
We ain't tell a story about all these girls we used to bang when we was young
Brothers see, they don't believe us
So ehm - I guess I'll start tellin...
A story when I was young
When I first got pussy
Check it out

[ VERSE 1 ]
It was in '77, well at least I think so
Way before the people knew me as K-S-o-l-o
We moved from Queens to Long Island and my moms had it made
But mom was workin two jobs, she said, "Son, I want me a maid"
We went to this agency that was on Broadway
So mom could fill out the papers and see about a maid
When we got there we seen a man who sat behind a desk
He said, "I'm sorry, miss, but ain't too many good maids left
But I'll show you some pictures of all the maids we got here"
I looked and seen this maid who looked like Pam Grier
I said, "Hey mom, let's get that maid, ooh, she looks like my teacher"
Mom said, "Okay" and asked the man, "Can we meet her?"
He pressed a button, said a name, she was there in a flash
Mom signed some papers, gave her money, and everything was done fast
On the way home I could look and see she looked young
And by the way she had me laughin, ooh, I knew she was fun
But somethin was wrong, I couldn't figure it out
Till one day me and the maid were alone in my house
I was in my room readin a book
She came inside my room naked and told me, "Kevin, take a look"
]From her feet to her body, I stared at shock
As I stared at her breast and her hairy provoc'
She had a real bad body, I was put in a trance
But snapped out of that trance when she unzipped my pants
She wrapped her legs around me, she began to tease me
Whispered in my ear, "Do you think you can please me?"
I said, "Yes", I couldn't fess
And then the maid grabbed my young hand and put it on her grown chest
She started seducin me, right there on the floor
She said, "The better you get, you'll get more and more"
Juices started movin fast, and she started goin
"I'm comin, I'm comin", I said, "Stop, where are you goin?"
She paid me no mind, I guess she knew I was young
I guess she said "It's for kids", but I was havin my fun
As she went up and down, and side to side
To make me slippery and wet as I went inside
The maid moaned and groaned, moved my hips
Blew in my ear, in my face and went and tongue-licked my lips
I was only 11 and in the 6th grade
No one believed that I made love to the household maid

No one believed that I made love to the household maid
You know what I'm sayin, Red?
No one believed that I made love to the household maid

Yo, yo, yo
Pee, man, what's up
Redman don't believe me, man
Check the next verse out
Check out the next verse

No one believed that I made love to the maid...

[ VERSE 2 ]
It happened again when I came from the park
Mom was workin late and the house looked dark
There was a note at the door, 'Son, dinner's in the oven'
Steak and potatos with blueberry muffins
But before I could get any food in my jaws
I seen a bra and a woman's panties on the living room floor
Where could she be, cause this I'm sure, mom could never see
The maid was in the room, butt naked cleanin the room for me
She grabbed my comic book, put it on her behind
Opened it up and said, "Hey, read between the line"
I love to read about the Incredlible Hulk
But when the maid grabbed me, she invaded the incredible bulk
On the floor by the AFX track, sweat comin from the back
Moms workin, we don't when she'll come back, black
I''m only 11 and in the 6th grade
No one believed that I made love to the household maid

Break it down, Solo

Gettin busy for 1992, you know what I'm sayin?
Mad true stories
Nobody believe me, you know what I'm sayin?
Yo, PMD, man
Brothers be goin out, man, on the strenght, man
Lyin about butt, man
You know what I'm sayin?
Yo, Redman, on the strenght...

Peace[K-Solo] Break it down!
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Yeah!
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Lies and rumors, rumors and lies
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] Lies and rumors, rumors and lies
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)

Verse One: K-Solo

Who's spreadin all the rumors, who's tellin all the lies?
Solo fell off? You must be drinkin St. Ide's
I'm back in effect on my second cassette
Check the untouched rep, scarin emcees like a bomb threat
Rumors and lies, at the same time try to destroy my name
Is this the price for fame?
If people got money, for rumors and talk
They'd have a lot of millionaires livin here in New York
Three number one hits, should kill the negative vibe
Solo's name and fame could never be denied
It's got me trapped in a corner and I wanna attack
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Two: K-Solo

I wrote 'Spellbound', to put my face on the map
But rumors have it that another man laid in jail wrote
That's impossible, Kevin Madison will take a stand
If he wrote 'Spellbound', who the hell wrote 'Letterman'?
Mission to make the non-believers there become a witness
When I release the hit, "Tell your moms ta mind her bizness"
It went number two, not far from number one
While the fugitive ran, I came back, to get the job done
Now they wanna tell lies, and take credit from a great
Hard working Solo artist, but this'll set em straight
I came back for ninety-two on a Sam Sneed track
I tried to hold it all in, but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Three: K-Solo

Cops won't arrest me, before, but now I'm on a tour
So what they knockin at my mother's door for?
The cash made I received, the money I was worth
But Solo couldn't change, cause I was taught first
To remember who you are, and where you come from
It won't be hard for you to become, number one
I don't like crowds around me ever, only a true friend
Can become an enemy so I stay Solo forever
I like it that way, but I hate when people say
Put me down on their record, so I can get paid
If I bring crews and other emcees on stage
And help everybody else, I never stay paid
So I write rhymes for Solo, and help myself
So when I get there, I can give another brother help
Kevin Solo demonstration left others and that's that
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
"K-S-O-L-O" "No longer a fugitive"

Verse Four: K-Solo

Now I got a new album, and a tape and a CD
And those who thought I fell off were really surprised to see
K-S-O-L-O throwin down and all the rumors
And the lies that they were spreadin couldn't keep me down!
Back out my face, keep my name out your mouth
This record got your cornered and there's no way out
Solo killed all the rumors cause I had to attack
I tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back

(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
[K-Solo] I can't hold it back
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Lies, rumors, rumors and lies)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)
(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo...)[K-Solo] Letterman!
[K-Solo] I'm the incredible Letterman!

"Now let me tell you who I am" -] Kane

[K-Solo]
I was in my room writing rhymes I H-A-D had
Next to my room was a laboratory run by my D-A-D dad
He was a professor, and I'm his S-O-N
So my life as a professor had just begun, my name is
K-E-V-I-N-M-A-D-I-S-O-N run the experiment I qualify
And become a good professor in medicine
I ran out my door, and I looked for
A breakbeat, spelling book, and grabbed my dog, "Woof!"
Rhymes that I had, every muscle from his body
The combination of that will give me strength, to rock a party
I thought that I might, get H-U-R-T hurt
If I used dad's melachalonin machine that was known to convert
No manual that I could find on dad's machine
I hit a button and this rumor turned the laboratory green
Some hairs was from my dog and a pair from mine
Hit the switch I spelled a rhyme the chromosome, will mix with mine
This uncanny combination will let the world understand
Professor Kevin Madison changed to the incredible Letterman!

'K-E-V-I-N-M-A-D-I-S-O-N-the-L-E-T-T-E-R-M-A-N'
[K-Solo] I'm the incredible Letterman!
'K-E-V-I-N-M-A-D-I-S-O-N-the-L-E-T-T-E-R-M-A-N'
[K-Solo] I'm the incredible Letterman!

K-Solo back in here for ninety-two
Throwin niggas to the curb

"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."

My microphone's rock heavy and my mic stand's bent
Worser than any soft song cause all my rhymes are made of cement
When I add wise words water with compound
Result's the earthquakes when my mic hits my ground
Vocabulary I wrote, from a stone age
I wrote the concrete rhyme on asphault, and got paid
Bricks and cinder blocks enter my mind fold
Results in words as small as gravel, to hard paved rap roads
I won't forget where I'm from, I thank God for stardom
I'm a hard rock from the rock bottom

"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."

The K's my home, the tune's my room
I sit on a cinder block and watch all my ideas bloom
I'm sittin in my room and I'm thinkin
My world is surface water, and just becaues I'm hard I'm sinkin
If I can live life like a bridge
And remain hard above the water that's the way I'd love to live
I air hard rhymes I might record em, this means
When the bridges come tumblin down now I'm in the water
Like a pebble, a rock, or a brick I can't swim
I bottle this, drown it in my rhythm
I'm from the rock bottom

"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."

My word'sll stick to any beats and mix like cement
My DJ sidewalk scratches will leave potholes in the pavement
Two stones, make as headphones, they hear the cuts
Kill the amp, to make, my mic amplitude stone
My hand holds a boulder, my army of pitbulls
Protect me, the hardrock soldier
Four paws, with locked jaws, GOT EM
"Yo.. yo.. my style's aggressive"
I'm from the rock bottom

"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
I'm from the rock bottom
"My rhymes are heavy like a rock so I'mma throw em like a bolo.."
K-Solo, is from the rock bottom

Song: Tales From the Crack Side

Tales From The Crack Side
Tales From The Crack Side
Tales From The Crack Side

I woke up in the morning, on a regular day
I knew my man named R, would be around my way
I brushed my hair, my teeth, suddenly I washed my face
Then he came over my house with the drug base
He kept saying if I take one hit of a pipe
I write records to rhyme before the rest of the night
I said, "R, I don't do drugs, or drugs are whack"
And ain't that base drug like a drug, CRACK
He said no Solo, see base is the shit
Girls puff of base, and everybody does it
He left off quick and left me the base and the pipe
And I thought I write a record a rhyme, before I reach night
I said if that's true, but any case
I couldn't wait to write my record after I smoke the base
He left the crib, I heard the telephone
It was my mom telling to watch my sister 'till she gets home
I hung up the phone, with no time to waste
I put my sister in the kitchen so I could smoke the base
It had a funny taste but it didn't taste bad I felt hot
That's when I got my pen and pad
I wrote a rhyme it was funky
I broke in a race
Cause the rhy that I wrote, tried to run off my page
I said, "Stop rhyme"
Then I grabbbed the rhyme and cut the rhyme
That I've seen running in my sight
I got a mind was happy when I thought the rhyme was dead
Some leaf swong and caught me square on the head
I fell on my floor and
The rhyme grabbed the knife
And cut my little sister
I thought it took her life
She fell on the floor, blood covered the rug
The rhyme was left and to my surprise I knew something was bugged
I got on the phone to call the cops, "what should I do?"
You'd did the same thing if you was in my shoes
As I started talking I seen the rhyme run by
And hit me with a can of ravioli in my eye
I fell on the floor look and when my vision cleared
I looked around the house and see the rhyme disappeared
I started to cry I said, "Oh, what would my mom say?"
That's when I heard a cop pulled up into the driveway
She came in the house she took a look at the place
See my sister still bleeding the knife and the base
She said, "You cut your sister while you were smoking that shit"
I said, "Mom, I didn't cut 'er, the rhyme did it"
I knew this was the truth, mom thought it was a lie
Some of y'll might even think it's just a Tale From The Crack Side

A Tale From The Crack Side
A Tale From The Crack Side

Mom was crying, she ran in shocked
Got on the phone, and then she started crying to the cops
So I ran out the door, and I looked for
The rhyme that cut my sister, who bled on my floor
I got in the yard, went out ran out in the street
I had to duck behind some trees cause I seen the police
When they ran in my house and shut up the block
I see my girl far coming to my house, and my jaw dropped
I said, "Baby stop," but yo she kept on walking
I knew pretty soon, the cops would be hawking
I never knew the trouble I was really headed for
'Till the rhyme appeared again dressed in Santa Claus
He said, "Ho Ho Ho baby you look great"
And told me dead on my face my girl was gonna get raped
Me watching this whole thing it was blowing my mind
Cause my girl was getting raped by this musical rhyme
He was sliding in fast my girl cried for help
I grabbed a stick, you know and Solo went for self
I hit the rhyme in the head and seen him drop
But hen the rhyme disappeared and all I seen was cops
They were coming for me fast I couldn't escape
Besides my girl was on the ground butt-naked yelling and raped
One cop gave 'er a coat and said "M.s are you alright?"
Another cop said that's the kid that cut his sister with the knife
I told them my name, I tried to explain
They heard the side of my story
They said "Boy you insane" you raped this girl too
Come on and just admit it
I said, "Man, I didn't rape 'her, the rhyme did it"
I knew this was the truth but cops thought it was a lie
Some of y'll might even think it just a Tale From The Crack Side

A Tale From The Crack Side
A Tale From The Crack Side
A Tale From The Crack Side

The cops tried to catch me, so I ran like hell
I needed someone to talk to, someone to tell
Cause all these things were happening they where blowing my mind
See, I knew I didn't do this, I knew it was a rhyme
But who would believe me in any high state of mind
If they ask me who did it, and I say it was a rhyme
The cops didn't buy it, this is why I 'm being chased
Then my mom told the cops that I was high, on base
I'm running I'm sweating
I suddenly knew that I had to get the piece out as fast as I can, so
I shoot up this corner, run up another block
Looked over my shoulders, and seen I lost the cops, then
I ran to his door, bang like a ring or two
He said "Solo, hey man the cops are looking for you"
I said, "Thanks to you the base and that pipe"
"I wrote a rhyme high last night and the rhyme came alive"
He started to laugh, said "Yeah right!"
I said, "It raped my girl on the block, and cut my sister with a knife"
He started laughing, he thought it was a joke
He said, "Yo Solo you had a little too much to smoke"
I grabbed him in the jaw, we started fighting on the floor
Suddenly that's when I heard someone that was coming from the door
To conclusion, enter my mind, I said
"Could it be the cops, or the rhyme"
But before when I told 'em my man pay me no mind
And when the door opened up, it came the rhyme
With a hammer in his hand he tried to hit me in the head
I ducked, but the hammer hit P instead
I started braeking then, I said this must be a nightmare
He was screaming on the floor and there was blood everywhere
I got on the phone, called the cops
She went into shock
And when I hung up the phone, cops was on the block
I stuck my head out the door, said, "Help me the rhyme is in here"
But then he dropped the hammer, again he disappeared
The cops kept asking me how did he get hit
I kept trying to tell the cops "Yo, the rhyme did it"
They didn't' buy it, they said "Boy you're bug"
"You can save that rhyme story, for the lawyer or the judge"
I get there the D.A. and judge still wouldn't listen
They gave me fifteen to twenty-five years in prision
They take me somewhere, far state
For attempted murder, assault too and rape
My family won't talk to me, my friends won't' see me
My girl now hates me, and she don't wanna marry me
Cause when this all dawned on me
It wasn't a rhyme it was just base technique
So I tell kids and adults in this place
This could happen to y'll if y'll smoke crack or base
So do yourself a favor stay away from this
Or you'll be in jail like I was yelling the rhyme did it
No one will believe you, they'll think you're telling a lie
And your life will become another, Tale From The Crack Side

Tom J, I'm outYeah! Tell your moms to mind her business

Your mom's in my business, she's in my business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go"

When I first met your moms, I gave your mom respect
But now I see she knows me, I see that she suspects
I'm some bad guy, I don't know why
You have to tell your mother lies about you and I
But when your first told me, she said that I was a no-no
Cause of my haircut and people call me Solo
Before the time you said, you really didn't care
Now you tell me to change my name, or even cut my hair
How would you ever go become somebody's wife
And at the age of 22 you let your mother run your life?
Me, I'm not the type to tell your moms to get lost
Yell out loud to flip and get my point across
See I think you should tell your moms to leave us two alone
And stop reading our love letters and evesdropping on the phone
Cause if you really liked my, you'd let your mommy know
She gotta mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)

Remember your sister and her boyfriend Sam Seed?
Your momma's the real reason why your sister lost her man
Her and sam went together, for a real long time
But Sam controlled her body while your mom controlled her mind
Not saying she was hurt when your moms made 'em break up
Deep down I could tell, though, your sister wanted to make up
With Sam, because she wanted to become his wife
And now she can't do that because your mother runs her life
You baby, you do the same things, too
You always want to to the crazy things your mommy wants you to do
Like when we went to the movie, she had to come along
I went back and forth and forth and back for peanuts and popcorn
She took advantage, cause I was living fat
I couldn't even watch the movie, she kept me running back
For something that she wanted somewhere else in the store
I walked and got it all til the man said there's no more
And when I got back to the car, she took her time to move over
When I sat in the car, my movie was like over
I was mad, hurt, I didn't want to talk
Deep down I wanted you and your mommy both to walk
I took you home anyway, like what the heck
Cause I was raised to treat people's mothers with respect
But when we got to your home, we wasn't left alone
She waited there in the car with us until I headed home
You called me on the phone, saying you were alone
But that's a lie because I heard your moms breathing on the phone
And if you really like me, let your moms know
She should mind her business "Before I let go"

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)

Without a doubt, me, like when I come to your house
She'll ask me crazy questions and start looking in my mouth
Her friends start laughing and I feel just like a jerk
I told 'em I don't know where my mom and dad work
I really know where they work, but that's between them and me
I can't be putting mom and dad's business in the street
Cause if I told her that my family both work for the state
Right after that she would've asked me how much money do they make
Then she'd go around the town, bragging and boasting
Telling the neighborhood what my family's grossing
Your moms, your moms, why is she so nosey?
She plays me like a game but I'm no ring-around-the-rosey
I even seen your dad at the family barbeque
He said "I don't see nothing wrong with my daugher seeing you"
But it's your wife mister, she don't think that I'm charming
She thinks she's Mr. Whippit and she thinks I'll squeeze her Charmin
I promise I won't do this to your daugher, calm man
Cause when I'm with girls, my reputation is not harming
If I'm not on tour, I'm working out at my house
I'll pick your daugher up sometime, and I'll even take her out
And every time I try to do this, I see without a doubt
Your wife will follow me around like a cop on a stakeout
And when I told the man that, I thought he would help me out
Til he said "I can't tell her nothing, she'll kick me out the house"
See, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls
Mothers love you, and they're concerned
But if you don't solve your own problems, then how can you learn?
And guys, if you're in a relationship like this
Don't be afraid to tell your girlfriend tell your moms to mind her business
But after me and you girl, I'd rather stay Solo
Because your moms can't mind her business, I'm a have to let you go
Because your mom is in my business

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business "Before I let go" (Repeat 2x)
