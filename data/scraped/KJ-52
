[Intro: KJ-52]
I'm bout to get up in my zone
It's time to get my Gameface on
It's time to get my Gameface on

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Gameface, all day
Ey day, all time
I drop these gems up on your head
Like an avalanche in a diamond mine
You chasing at your 'dollah' signs
I'm chasing at my God and I'm placing my faith up in His grace
I'll run this race
Bottom line
And I came down to try to find who's down to ride & roll with me
I'm Gameface up here tonight cause how You died and who You be
And I'm goin' in
I'm showin' them
Just what You give and done for me
And I know I live
I know my sin is gone and I been redeemed and

[Pre-Hook: KJ-52]
I'm feeling like a beast
Someone let me out
I'm feeling like I'm free
Someone let me out
If you're feeling just like me and
Someone let you out
Then get up on your feet
It's gametime, let me hear you shout!

[Hook: Soul Glo Activatur]
Go-goin' in for the win (Gameface)
Body full of adrenaline (In my Gameface)
Turnt in my zone, goin' hard like I'm Lebron
Wa-wa-watch me take it home (In my Gameface)

Wa-wa-watch me take it home (In my Gameface)

[Bridge: FLAME]
I'm running hard and I run for God and I live it

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Turn it up, let it bump in the trunk
When I'm packing 'em up and I'm blasting the vocal
Heard enough from the rap and the junk from the cats that are up
Put the rap in a choke hold
I'm back and I laugh at the fact that you packing a Mack and I'm packing a no doze
Imma break it down, shake it down, take it down, make a sound
Kinda, kinda fast or in slo-mo

[Verse 3: KB]
Oh-oh-oh-ok G we're the A-Team
That hard work, we see action
They, they trying to skip the labour
Sit them boys in the C-Section
We live this, no Theoretics
And we got class, don't need credit
Train ourselves in godliness and it's obvious
You know the problem is?
That my clique strong, and our wins long
Beastmode, don't switch off
And our day starts before it hits dawn
And we finishing while ya'll getting up
I hate the pain when I wait to train
5AM I don't like
But Imma buckle down, suffer down
Cause Imma be the champ for my whole life
Ok G, against my team
Ya'll boys won't float like Macy's Day Parade on the money they making or
But they money won't save 'em see
They think that my guys won't break 'em (take 'em down)
They don't really wanna wake us (haters clown)
They don't really wanna play us
You boys better step Channing Tatum
They know

[Verse 4: Flame]
Hey, KJ, thought you'd never see the day
When I'm on this remix
Show me, homie, what they play
He says own that
He says all that
That's exactly what I did
Grace (x6)
So I take the ball, and I'm running hard
And I run for God and I never stop [?]
You get all of me
You get all of me

[Pre-Hook: KJ-52]
I'm feeling like a beast
Someone let me out
I'm feeling like I'm free
Someone let me out
If you're feeling just like me and
Someone let you out
Then get up on your feet
It's gametime, let me hear you shout!

[Bridge: FLAME]


(In my Gameface)[Hook: SPZRKT]
Welcome to the island of the misfit toys (x3)
Yeah
Land of the broken girls and boys

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
I'm sittin' in detention feeling like the breakfast club
Staring at my desk wishing that I had a hug
I wouldn't pay attention but what i paid for love
But when you're searching for some hope man, that junks a drug
Awkward, introvert, really had nowhere to turn
Crumbling, insecure, struggling with the hurt
Stomach all up in a churn rumbling up in my shirt
Wishing that I had a girl but all I ever get is burned
They say nerds gotta wait they turn
And I'm heartsick while I'm living in a dream deferred
My heart gripped in pain
Mouth full of curse words
I can't get away until I read the first verse
Of Your word, then I learned of my birth curse
And that you died for me, and all my net worth
I realized my need just to make a second birth
I bowed my knee and said take away the hurt

[Bridge: KJ-52]
This is for the misfits

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Marty]
Goes out to you, brother
Yeah, I know I got a bad reputation
Walk around, always mad reputation
Make a pretty girl, sad reputation
Probably should be dead reputation
But life moves fast, and if you blink, you gon' miss it
Miss the pain in the voice if you don't listen
Sittin' by myself at the lunch table
Wishing that I had some real friends but I knew that I didn't
I try to do my best, I don't fit in
I realize now, I'm a misfit
But what would you do in my position
When it all falls down and you're the one that it's hittin'

[Bridge 2: KJ-52]
This is for the misfits
Rejects
Losers
Defects
Weirdos

[Hook]

[Verse 3: FERN]
From a place so vulnerable where I'm coming from
About to break down I'm feeling so overdone
Lost my young boy, but joy showed up in the morning
And all of a sudden my burdens just weren't important
Got to live life, fly high where the eagles are
And me out here pointing where the steeples are
Yeah, been overlooked wishing they would notice you
Doing everything in your power to get a hold of you
Rejected by the world accepted by the Lord puttin' numbers on the board
And we're misfits 'til it's finished
And I love you and hope you get to hear this

[Bridge 3: Marty, FERN & KJ-52]
This is for the cutters
The goofballs
Runaways
Lonely
Miserable
Bullied kids
Feeling like the old me
Don't you forget
You are loved
You are loved
You are loved
This is for the dreamers
Lovers
Thugs
Block huggers
Killers
Stuck up in the prison
Listen
Don't you forget
You are loved
You are loved
You are loved[Verse 1]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
Before I had status and a two-way pager
You could find the KJ listening to hip-hop
Blastin it so loud my parents was like "Turn it off"
I used to rock turtlenecks with MC Hammer pants
Watch Yo MTV raps just to catch the latest dance
I did the running man they said not bad for a white man
I said I'm not really white I just really need a tan
I used to write the girlie's phone numbers down upon my hand
And I didn't go nowhere without my tapes and walkman
Rolling up the bottom of my pants as tight as I can
And I'm up late at night talking to my girlfriend saying...

[Interlude]
Whatcha doin?
Nothin
I gotta go
Umm allright
You hang up first
No you hang up first
On the count of three...1...2...3...still there?

[Hook]
Back in the day (I was so cool)
Back in the day (The coolest one in school)
Back in the day (Well I can't lie to you)
Back in the day (I was a nerdy little dude)

[Verse 2]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I wanted lines in my eyebrows so I took a razor
But I messed up and accidently I just sshaved the
Whole eyebrow off I was like "I'm going crazy!"
See it was tough just growing up in the 80's
But for me it was rough cuz no girls would ever date me
All the ladies I would ask out was like "Well maybe....
You're okay but you're no Patrick Swayze"
Unfortunately I think all my teachers hate me
Cuz i sit in the back making noises like I'm crazy
Ahhhhhhhhh...But it's all gravy
In third period today I'm gonna ask out this lady
Got the paper got the pencil now whoops here I go
Will you go out with me check yes or no
I'm feeling all slick when I handed her the note
I told you ten times already no now leave me alone

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I was only 15 when I just met my savior
And he came in straight in my heart and he just changed the
Way I used to live in ill behavior
See it's amazing to see my life that I just gave ya
So amazing to me Jesus Christ you became the
Savior to me and ain't never been the same the
Way I would be back in the day it would amaze ya
But the change that I see it was done in a major
Way I would be so that all I can do is thank ya
And every day just for me is a new day to praise ya
Cuz you came just to be all I need and you just made a way for
Me to see so I broke it down for you
Now I'm a take you back in the day kind of like this dude.....

[Outro]
Dum dum dum du du dum dum
Dum dum dum du du dum dum
Ya can't touch this

[Hook]Verse 1(Kj52)

Say what you wanna say its plain I ain’t never worried
I got my hands up and down like it’s 12:30
And they can go ahead and clown that could never hurt me
Ain’t nothing but sound I’m rolling out just on my journey
And I ain’t never hurried cuz see I’m on my way
I’m swimming upstream going out against the grain
And that’s what happens when you going in a different lane
You never mixing well like Listerine and Gatorade
So Let them haters hate man they just some people
I got a passion now for Christ like its Jim Caveziel
I got a passion now for life and now there’s none equal
Hes coming back that’s the fact that’s the one sequel

[Hook]

Shake em up shake em up now shake em up
Shake em up shake em up
Shake em up shake em up now shake em up
Shake em up wake em up

Verse 2(Thi'sl)

Might seem just kind of strange might seem just kind of plain
So When u see me all you see white ts and wallet chains
But when I'm speaking oh you think this kid is kind of lame
But let my life just speak out scream out and call the name
Might seen a lotta pain might seen a lot shame
But its just Jesus he's the reason that I gotta claim
He’s what you needing for your life to see a lot change
And like the phoenix you can rise speeding out this flame
Here’s why he came cuz you need this doctor
See man is sick w/ sin and he can treat it proper
The problem is though we don’t ever even seek the father
You got the point yadda yadda now we gonna[Verse 1]
Look at how far I come
I was living like on the run
I was living like for the fun
So lost 'fore I found the sun
Looking back at everything I done
You called and said to come
I saw and just thought to run
Right into the arms of the Only One

Yeah, we can't stop, won't stop
Riding down home tonight
Yeah, we can't stop, won't stop
Riding down home tonight

[Hook]
Right now tonight
We're giving everything to You
And our hearts, our souls, our lives
And every little thing we do
Tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm going on a whole new path
Out on a whole new chap'
Ain't nothing gonna hold me back
I've been through that, I won't come back
You're the only thing that lasts
You're the only thing I have
You gave me a whole new chance
To bring me back every time I crash
I give You everything I have
I give You everything I lack
I give you everything I can't
Sorta hope I found to stand

I can't stop, I won't stop
I don't stop, oh, no
I can't stop, I won't stop
I don't stop, I go

[Hook] (2x)

Tonight
We're giving everything
We're giving everything[Verse 1]
I rolled out the bed as the alarm started going off
I rubbed my head with my arm, it was the crack of dawn
I'm late for work, and I really just hate my job
I kissed my wife good-bye, and then I walk across the lawn
Got in the car out the driveway and I'm riding on the road by the mall
Past the highway that I'm flying on but
It slows to crawl cause some guy was just driving wrong
And I'm getting mad, cuz I wonder why it's going on
"Get out the way," I just scream as I'm driving on
I hate my day and this way that it started off
I change lanes and I thought that I was pulling onto
The main lane but just then I saw this green Honda
It straight came next thing it was the window shattered
Felt a great pain my body being bruised and battered
It all changed went black and I knew I had it
I coughed blood, breathed my last breath, that was it

[Hook]
What you gonna do when there's no time left?
What you gonna do when you take your last step?
What you gonna do when you take your last breath
Out your chest and find out that there's life after death? [x2]

[Verse 2]
Next thing I know everything just got real quiet
I opened my eyes to my surprise now it's real silent
I realized I had died now it's my judgment
I'm standing before the Most High now and all of the sudden
He said to me, "Why should I let you into my Heaven?"
I told God, "Well usually I'm a good person."
He showed my life and all the times now that I was sinning
From every line, to every curse, to every bad decision
From every lie, to every word; there was nothing hidden
He showed how Christ died and with my life that I'd killed Him
He showed me time after time how I'd reject Him
I never cared about the sacrifice God had given
I never cared about my life or the way I lived it
And now I've died and it's too late to be forgiven
Guilty of my crime I'm sentenced to eternal prison
It's dark, I'm alone, I feel my flesh burning

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I rolled out the bed as the alarm started going off
I scratch my head and then I yawned it was the crack of dawn
I'm praying and I'm thanking God that I got my job
I kissed my wife good-bye then I walked across the lawn
Got in the car out the driveway and I'm riding on the road by the mall
Past the highway that I'm flying on but
It slows to crawl cause some guy was just driving wrong
But I'm not mad I just wonder why it's going on
I use the time to pray for my family now and for my mom
I'm thanking God for the way my day had started off
I change lanes and I thought that I was pulling onto
The main lane but doesn't that guy see my green Honda?
It straight came next thing it was the window shattered
Felt a great pain my body being bruised and battered
It all changed went black and I knew I had it
I coughed blood, breathed my last breath, that was it

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Next thing I know everything just got real quiet
I opened my eyes to my surprise now it's real silent
I realized I had died now it's my judgment
I'm standing before the Most High now and all of the sudden
He said to me, "Why should I let you into My heaven?"
I told God, "I never was a good person."
He showed my life and all the times now that I was sinning
From every line, to every curse, to every bad decision
From every lie, to every word; there was nothing hidden
He showed how his Son died and with my life that I'd killed Him
But He showed the time I chose Christ and I didn't reject Him
He showed the time when I took the love that God had given
He tried to serve through my life whenever I lived it
And now I've died but I thank God that I'm forgiven
He wiped the tears from my eyes as I cried and thanked Him
Cuz forever I'm a be with Him just in Heaven

[Hook x2][Hook]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
To whom it may concern x4

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Dear Slim I never wrote you or been calling
My name ain't Stan son, nah we've never met and
My name's KJ let me begin by introducing now
Myself to you and these very reasons I'll be writing
Why I took the time, the who what where and why and
The purpose of my verse, the reasons I'm reciting
What I hope your learning from the truth I pray your finding
And every word I'm writing down upon the dotted lines and
See I heard ya first album, was called Infinite
I shook my head cause nowadays you sounding different
What drove ya take your whole persona and be flipping it now
What makes a man totally change see I ain't getting it
See was you sick of getting booed when you was ripping it
And sick of never having dough and you your wanted to put an end to it
What good's all kinds of dough
Plus all kinds of flow
To gain a world of fans but suffer the loss of soul

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Dear Slim I never wrote you or been calling
This is my 2nd letter cause see son I gots a real problem
It's that to you that I'm always catching these comparisons
And after shows I got these people coming up to me saying
You sound like Slim Shady son you sound like Eminem
And I be like now really man, do I gots to go through this again
See I used to get mad and sick of people saying that
Till at this one show this one day I met this one cat
He told me how he used to listen to you but now he listens to me
Had your LP but threw it out and bought my CD
I'm like for real he's like yeah he said my music made a difference
It got him away from all your words and images
I gotta mention this, now what about the effects you have on kids
You ever stop to think about the millions you influence
Or is it just irrelevent is it true life you telling it
Or just the way for some record companies selling it
The only thing we got in common is our melanin
Or lack of it but anyway now this is what I'm sayin
It's for you that I'm on my knees now daily prayin
Praying that God opens your eyes now to what I'm relaying
Now I'm praying that it's your heart that will soon be changing
Praying one day that you'll be calling upon His name and
But anyway I'm signing off now don't keep me waiting
This is KJ another cat just trying to make it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
Dear Slim I heard about the stuff you's going through
See I could relate to you cause son I'm about as old as you
See we both know what it's like just to be growing up to be in a neighborhood
When you's the only one and only kid that's white
Or to get booed when you on the mic just because your skin is light
It ain't right but sometimes you know that's life
But really tell me what you do
You just push on with hopes on that someday you'll put on your crew
I hope you understand that I ain't even dissing you
And even though its a song you'll probably never listen to
See what I send to you is this
Is that a life without Christ is just a life that is never fixed
Hope you remember this now a few sentences
About a living God who loves you and plus forgives
And I'll be praying for your ex-wife and plus your kid
It's hard to live in a world as crazy as this one is
And even though now it really might sound redundant
God's got mad love for you up in a mad abundance
You'll sell a couple mill I'll probably sell a couple hundred
There's more to life then selling records and just getting blunted
But anyway that's really all I gots to say
Just another word from an MC now around the way
Maybe some day we meet each other in some way
Till then one love one God one way

[Hook][Verse 1: KJ-52]
I'm like some piranha in some bloody water
I'm coming nicely with the blah-blah
Giving praise to the eternal Jah-Jah
Eternal Father flowing in this living water
Your rhymes ca-ca talking all ya rah-rah
Mic's is sparking I'm tight like arteries that was hardened
I beg your pardon the 52 is strictly parting
Emcees like I'm Moses
No matter what your coast is, no matter what your flow is
No matter who's the dopest, without Christ, you're hopeless
I shake dust from opposers, get your open like roses
Burning microphone holders, assembling all the soldiers
Open your current orders
I'm attacking tape recorders while I'm holding down this fortress

[Hook: Yankee Man]
1, 2, 3, follow after He, Christ is the Son of the Almighty
1, 2, 3, follow after He, Christ is the Son of the Almighty
1, 2, 3, follow after He, Christ is the Son of the Almighty
1, 2, 3, follow after He, Christ is the Son of the Almighty

[Verse 2: Yankee Man]
Tell all the people salvation is free
Read about it in the Bible tell you about a friend for free
He's the way the truth the life and also the key
Enter into the paradise and all his glory (Man!)
The Savior will come once again
The Christ, the Son of Man, I say He's upon this style
If you want to know me, say me be coming on top of the clouds (Boom)
Christ the one who said to be born again
Every man the Savior say come set your soul free for real
All man he save them but most are passing Him
If you want to know me, see me, come back again now say.....

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
It's hard to be a star when your skills ain't up to par
It's hard to push a Lex when you don't even own a car
It's hard to win the battle when you can't win this war
It's hard to be a man when you don't know who you are
I stay on point just like some harpoons
Develop thoughts in verbal dark rooms taking on these cartoons
Your mind's spinning like some typhoons
These martial artists flip scripts to leave you open like some gaping wounds
Call me 52 this predator
My microphone's like Excalibur attacking y'all with metaphors
So my competitors can now check your exit doors
Choice is yours Jesus reigns like when it pours
The Lord God Most High superior
These haters lay up in this cut like bacteria
I'm never fearing you, I see through exteriors
I keep on scoping out these moves from ulterior
Stay devoted still checking all your motives
Thoughts unloaded though so many times I'm misquoted
So now it's noted these origins of residence
So my adversaries can now make they exodus
Cause it's my nemesis escorted off the premises
There ain't no guessing this when I proceed to finish this
52 the chemicist, head seeking lyricist
Standing with my locust fist now I got you choking this
But your broker diss got lost with your hopelessness
But from genesis I'll still stand opposing this
Smack it up, if they last name is skills your first name should be lack of
It's time to act up or call in your back up
These fools make me crack up
Fronting is what you have a knack of
You talk your junk but then you come around to give me mad love
Whatever, I got's no time for you
So go ahead and spend time with your crab crew
Yo I'll see you on album number two

[Hook][Verse 1]
Let me bust a rhyme tell a story like Slick Rick
And put a sermon like Erick in your ear like a Q-Tip
Now it's common sense that Jah rules
But I'm a tell you about Jesus, who's the leader of the new school

[Verse 2]
You thinking you's cool you emcees is lost boys
Got no cash money you juvenile like some hot boys
I drop noise when I let the sound blast
And tell Big Boy Andre about Jesus Christ the outcast
Here's the deal I feel it's now time to be real
Christ died on Calvary not on Cypress Hill

[Verse 3]
It don't matter even if you're slim or if you're shady
Jay-Hova reigns supreme but his name ain't Jay-Z
And it's most def' that the mob was deep
That hung the Son of Man who died just to bring back the lost sheep
On all streets all peeps naughty by nature
Whether you biggie or small you can know the living Savior now

[Verse 4]
Let me take you back to the old school
And tell you about the fresh prince of peace now who just cold rules
We keep it nice and smooth Rakim like Eric B
And run dee Emcees to show our biz like AG
See I'm down with two live crews full of fat boys
And even though we young emcees now we can't avoid
The one who ever lasts reigns as the Lamb slain
Just for you and I Jesus went to the house of pain

[Verse 5]
You can be the black sheep but Christ reigns supreme
Drink ya ice tea with some vanilla ice cream
Don't matter to me be the public enemy
He'll still make your sin disappear like he's Houdini
In this biz I put his name on the marquee
That's why I'm calling out these names when I emcee

[Verse 6]
Check it now you can bounce with me
No limit to my God like Master P
What audacity it's quite ludicrous actually
To think you could trick your daddy
God the Father sees everything naturally
You can't fool Him I'm like whoa nelly
He'll put bone thugs back in harmony
It ain't hard to see just what He's done for me

[Verse 7]
I knew a guy named Bubba who'd spark the place
He was little like Wayne and had a scar face
But now this cat done changed his ways
Talking how he's saved from amazing grace
Understand that Christ had to see murder
So you and I when we die live forever
East south or old school flavor
47 emcees is how I hit ya[Intro]
Hey, yo
As if 47 emcees wasn't enough, I got 47 pop stars, rock stars coming at you
Yo, count them
Here we go

[Hook]
Just do it
Just do it do it do it
Just do it rock to it
Put ya hands up high and move it

[Verse 1]
Sometimes i flow weird throw verbal spears like Britney
That literally go from here to Houston just like Whitney
Battle me man you kidding me you just a funny cat
I bet you 50 cents to M&Ms you won't get a nickel back
The track I'm ripping that cause it really ain't that hard
See Jesus gives destiny to every child of God
I'm battle scarred kind of raw but what did you think?
No matter race religion or the color or the creed.
If ya black brown or pink or in or out of sync
Or hang with the beastie boys that's on the back street
You can live in Lincoln Park it don't matter just to me
See the prince of peace is guaranteed to give you what you need

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
One day these peeps they was going past me
Walking with a limp eating biscuits and their hair was shaggy
I said "What's y'alls name? That's the question that I'm asking."
"I'm Michael, that Celine, that's Dion, that's Jackson
Rickey and Martin that's Tony and Braxton
Drew is on the hill he just chilling and relaxing
Alicia lost her keys and shes really kind of sad." and
I said, "You too? No doubt i know how that be happening
But i need all the Dixie chicks to gather in
And let me just explain now the reason I'm rappening."
So i told mariah he carried my sin and died for me
My faith is in Christ, who on a hill called calvary
Gave his life for mine so genuine i try to be
If the world tries to stop me I rage against the machine
So i turn ya radio up and head to the spot
Get loose like a slipknot, watch the kid rock

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
My uncle was eating corn on a cracker all alone
It was 98 degrees out and he was counting crows
And it was just then my papa now he just saw a roach
He dropped his red hot chili peppers and then he ran home
And just went they called up John the mayor on the phone
"It's a 311, 3 doors down. Now don't be slow!"
But he was like wait a second hold a minute bro
Before I usher on over now there's something you should know
Jesus is the firm rock not a rolling stone
With him heaven, not nirvana is where you'll go
And I try to show and let ya know but ya third eye is blind
You need to just open them up just real wide
And even if you have to blink 182 times
It's just so obvious that it can't hide
TLC tender loving care now he'll provide
From girls to boys to men they need to let him inside

[Hook] x2Who am I? The one that gets laced tight
The one you wear, hit a flare on the same night
That you hit an uprock, I'm the one in the closet next to one sock
The one you rock on the cardboard box
Walking to the one block
You know the one spot peeps get the one shot
Got one thought on the task at hand
You can ask your man I'm part of master plan
Only b-boys and b-girls, they understand
Whatever you say now, ya wish is my command
Name it, I'll be the footwork to your head spin
Follow your lead, go anyplace that ya legs bend
At ya cipher session I'm ya best friend
I got a twin, we's a pair clocking size 10
Head's a shell, three stripes on side
Laces large, on your feets I reside
Keep me clean, keep me laced, and I'll be allright
I be the first element up in here tonight

Who am I? See, I'm the one that you be gripping tight
The one that makes you sound real good when you be flipping right
And I'm the one causing fights up at the open mic
I'll make ya sound real stupid if you don't hold me right
I got emcees fiending for me all day and night
I could care less if ya on me if ya black or white
See all that matters when you rock me don't be coming wack and
Don't hold me to the speaker or I'ma feedback and
I'm used for rapping, every now and the used for passng
Back and forth in ya crew in a freestyle fashion
I get rocked, ripped, flipped on and blasted
I'm spoke on, choke on, hit on, spit on, and mastered
I've outlasted, been used to tell truth and lies
Used to kill the youth and used to open up they eyes
I come in all kinds of sizes, heard all kinds of voices
Sometimes I'm plugged in, you know sometimes I'm cordless
Keep me clear, keep me close, and I'll be allright
See I'm the second element up in here tonight

Who am I? I got two heads and they always spinning
I got two arms that the deejays, they use for ripping
Plus a fader in my middle that they always gripping
I'm completed with the two records used for mixing
They pulling tricks and cutting up, ya know they scratching
Remixing beat, juggling just whie they mix and match and
All kinds of beats till it's the heat that I know ya catching
And I'm the one that started hip-hop in case ya asking
I got knobs and faders in a mad abundance
I come in many names, but most time it's 1200
When I get played now, you know that you truly love it
Now clean the needle on my arm or I'll be sounding busted
I'm disregarded, treated like I ain't legitimate
I'm making music, you don't see me as an instrument
And it takes true skills to get on me and be ripping it
Nobody sees my contribution, they ain't getting it
You know there's one thing that really now makes me mad
You used to blow me off but now I'm the latest fad
I'm the thing that every rock band they got's to have
Now people say my name and they be like "Now what is that?"
Keep me running, keep me spinning, and I'll be allright
I'll be the third element up in here tonight

Who am I? Se I'm hiding in your backpack
You tear my tip off, replace it with a fat cap
I'm 12 oz. of steel concealed in a knapsack
Ya pull me out, ya shake me up, and then attack that
Wall or train while ya steady throwing up your name
Leaving these end to end burners, ya getting ghetto fame
Now me and my brothers, ya know we come in many colors
Steady beautifying the walls of a ghetto culture
Toys and suckers now you know they getting dissed quick
I'm going all city all up in ya district
Ya hold me with control so I never drip thick
I'm tagging up ya spot, nobody misses it
See I'm the brush to a modern day type DiVinci
I'm the new urban renewal for ya block's committee
I've spoken words of the youth of an inner city
I'm vandalism but to others I'll be called graffiti
Keep me shaking, keep me spraying, and I'll be allright
I be the fourth element up in here tonight

Who am I? See I'm the God that you don't know about
I gave you breath up in your lungs that you can't go without
See you know the facts of My story you been told about
I'm always reaching out for you but you just keep on holding out
I know your doubts, I know you're thinking that I ain't real
See I know you forgot about Me when you got ya last record deal
See I know the way you feel, I walked the earth just like you
And like a child up in his Father's arms, I long to hide you
Many times I invite you while standing here right besides you
But you walk right past, you ignore My hands here given to guide you
I gave you gifts, I gave you talents that you just used to gain your wealth
But you took my gifts and talents only for you, just to glorify yourself
I was beaten and bruised, crushed now for your iniquity
Stripped naked, I was spit upon just for you to live eternally
Yet you blaspheme Me, you make moves without asking Me
Then you blame Me for your troubles and calamities, you kidding me?
Keep Me first, keep Me in your life, and it's gonna be all right
See I'm Jesus Christ, the Fifth Element up in here tonight[Verse 1]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
Before I had status and a two-way pager
You could find the KJ listening to hip-hop
Blastin it so loud my parents was like "Turn it off"
I used to rock turtlenecks with MC Hammer pants
Watch Yo MTV raps just to catch the latest dance
I did the running man they said not bad for a white man
I said I'm not really white I just really need a tan
I used to write the girlie's phone numbers down upon my hand
And I didn't go nowhere without my tapes and walkman
Rolling up the bottom of my pants as tight as I can
And I'm up late at night talking to my girlfriend saying...

[Interlude]
Whatcha doin?
Nothin
I gotta go
Umm allright
You hang up first
No you hang up first
On the count of three...1...2...3...still there?

[Hook]
Back in the day (I was so cool)
Back in the day (The coolest one in school)
Back in the day (Well I can't lie to you)
Back in the day (I was a nerdy little dude)

[Verse 2]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I wanted lines in my eyebrows so I took a razor
But I messed up and accidently I just sshaved the
Whole eyebrow off I was like "I'm going crazy!"
See it was tough just growing up in the 80's
But for me it was rough cuz no girls would ever date me
All the ladies I would ask out was like "Well maybe....
You're okay but you're no Patrick Swayze"
Unfortunately I think all my teachers hate me
Cuz i sit in the back making noises like I'm crazy
Ahhhhhhhhh...But it's all gravy
In third period today I'm gonna ask out this lady
Got the paper got the pencil now whoops here I go
Will you go out with me check yes or no
I'm feeling all slick when I handed her the note
I told you ten times already no now leave me alone

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I was only 15 when I just met my savior
And he came in straight in my heart and he just changed the
Way I used to live in ill behavior
See it's amazing to see my life that I just gave ya
So amazing to me Jesus Christ you became the
Savior to me and ain't never been the same the
Way I would be back in the day it would amaze ya
But the change that I see it was done in a major
Way I would be so that all I can do is thank ya
And every day just for me is a new day to praise ya
Cuz you came just to be all I need and you just made a way for
Me to see so I broke it down for you
Now I'm a take you back in the day kind of like this dude.....

[Outro]
Dum dum dum du du dum dum
Dum dum dum du du dum dum
Ya can't touch this

[Hook][Hook]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
To whom it may concern x4

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
Dear Slim I never wrote you or been calling
My name ain't Stan son, nah we've never met and
My name's KJ let me begin by introducing now
Myself to you and these very reasons I'll be writing
Why I took the time, the who what where and why and
The purpose of my verse, the reasons I'm reciting
What I hope your learning from the truth I pray your finding
And every word I'm writing down upon the dotted lines and
See I heard ya first album, was called Infinite
I shook my head cause nowadays you sounding different
What drove ya take your whole persona and be flipping it now
What makes a man totally change see I ain't getting it
See was you sick of getting booed when you was ripping it
And sick of never having dough and you your wanted to put an end to it
What good's all kinds of dough
Plus all kinds of flow
To gain a world of fans but suffer the loss of soul

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Dear Slim I never wrote you or been calling
This is my 2nd letter cause see son I gots a real problem
It's that to you that I'm always catching these comparisons
And after shows I got these people coming up to me saying
You sound like Slim Shady son you sound like Eminem
And I be like now really man, do I gots to go through this again
See I used to get mad and sick of people saying that
Till at this one show this one day I met this one cat
He told me how he used to listen to you but now he listens to me
Had your LP but threw it out and bought my CD
I'm like for real he's like yeah he said my music made a difference
It got him away from all your words and images
I gotta mention this, now what about the effects you have on kids
You ever stop to think about the millions you influence
Or is it just irrelevent is it true life you telling it
Or just the way for some record companies selling it
The only thing we got in common is our melanin
Or lack of it but anyway now this is what I'm sayin
It's for you that I'm on my knees now daily prayin
Praying that God opens your eyes now to what I'm relaying
Now I'm praying that it's your heart that will soon be changing
Praying one day that you'll be calling upon His name and
But anyway I'm signing off now don't keep me waiting
This is KJ another cat just trying to make it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
Dear Slim I heard about the stuff you's going through
See I could relate to you cause son I'm about as old as you
See we both know what it's like just to be growing up to be in a neighborhood
When you's the only one and only kid that's white
Or to get booed when you on the mic just because your skin is light
It ain't right but sometimes you know that's life
But really tell me what you do
You just push on with hopes on that someday you'll put on your crew
I hope you understand that I ain't even dissing you
And even though its a song you'll probably never listen to
See what I send to you is this
Is that a life without Christ is just a life that is never fixed
Hope you remember this now a few sentences
About a living God who loves you and plus forgives
And I'll be praying for your ex-wife and plus your kid
It's hard to live in a world as crazy as this one is
And even though now it really might sound redundant
God's got mad love for you up in a mad abundance
You'll sell a couple mill I'll probably sell a couple hundred
There's more to life then selling records and just getting blunted
But anyway that's really all I gots to say
Just another word from an MC now around the way
Maybe some day we meet each other in some way
Till then one love one God one way

[Hook][Verse 1]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you ain't calling
It's been a couple years now since I wrote that song, and
A lot has changed now for you and I
I had no clue that I would write a song for you and
It would change some lives
Kids with tears in their eyes
They now come up to me
Showing love to me
And telling me that they look up to me
The effects to me, well
It's really kinda strange to see
I only wanted to share with you now
What Jesus done for me
But there's a whole 'nother side to things now
That I come to see
It's a huge influence you got upon on the industry
But enough of me
Cause it's not what I came to say to you
Not a day goes by where I [don't] take time to pray for you
I'm sorry now for what your mom and dad
They did to you
But I can relate with you
Cause well see dude I've been there too
I know there's a lot of pain and hurt
Now that you've been through
But never forget there's a real love God gave to you

[Hook]
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
To whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Still, to whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
To whom it may concern
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
It's still, to whom it may concern

[Verse 2]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
Backstage at the VMA's someone gave you my song and
I'm kinda wondering what you thought, man
Or when that guy walked up to you
And talked to you and put it in your hands
Maybe you never listen to it or
Maybe you lost it
Or maybe you heard it and you just got mad
And then you tossed it
"Did he diss you back?"
That's the question I always get
And I'm like, "Well, God forbid that you might even have liked it."
I don't know but
Congratulations on your movie yo and
Heard your last record well, it's over ten million sold
But there's one thing that's really got me thinking bro
Does a Grammy mean anything if it's just gotta cost your soul?
In case you didn't know, there's a love that will never go away
You say you're going to hell but it don't have to be that way
See the bottom line of what I'm trying to say is
God puts back together the broken pieces
That are were thrown away
If even everyone you know
Just up and goes away
He'll still love you till the very day
That you're old and gray
Too bad a lot of Christians all they do is hate on you
Instead of dropping to their knees
And taking time to pray for you
And it's obvious that you really love your daughter dude
And for that I gotta tell you, well, I really got respect for you
So here it is, Dear Slim, Chapter Part 2
Another cat trying to make it just like you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, Dear Slim, did you hear the junk that I'm going through
Kids sending me hate mail and telling me
How I'm biting you
Telling me how they gonna beat me up and just kill me too
But a lot of people they just seem to get my song confused
See what I say to you I know it might even sound funny
But I never came at you just to paint you has the enemy
It wasn't about hating you or starting some controversy
It wasn't about blaming you or trying to make some money
I don't claim to know everything that you've experienced
Man I don't even know if you even ever be hearing this
But I said it once and I still hold to this
Is that a life with out Christ is still a life that is never fixed
I'll tell you this even if it's a hard pill to swallow
Like it or not Slim, you will always be a role model
Do you know these kids, we're the ones they always follow
What we say and how we live gives them a better tomorrow
I've had my share of some, plus man I've been rejected
I've been chewed up, spit out, and cussed; disrespected
But if I die today and never sell another record
Jesus gave me more than I ever could of been expected
I know life is hectic, it can leave you blown away
But check it bro cause we all just gonna die someday
And on that note, well, there's only one thing left to say
There's still one love and one god and only one way

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
My arms are sliced up but I'm not embarrassed
It's the only way I get attention now from my parents
It's not like they really take the time to be caring
They just use me to watch the baby when they run they errands
My name is Erin, I got a friend named Karen
She gave me your CD with the track for Eminem
You wrote a song called #1 fan I listened and
I wanted to know if you can help me like you was helping them
She had something even harder to be mentioning
Like every single day I struggle just with fitting in
Plus the boys won't give me no attention and
I get teased and made fun of by all my friends and then
See I'm feeling like I'm wishing now that I could end
My life cuz I'm sick and tired of all the time I spend
Trying to figure out how I could be worth anything
Can you help me KJ from your fan

[Hook]
I'm writing this letter
Cause I have to tell ya
I need some help from you
I'm writing this letter
I hope that you get it
I need some help from you

[Verse 2]
I live with my mom ever since my parents split
And At home I spend my time on the Internet
Looking at porn I'm addicted and I'm sick of it
Myspace.com is mostly where I'm getting it
On top of that there's videos that I can watch
And I really wanna quit but its like I can't stop
See I'm scared that I'm just gonna get caught
And when I see a girl all I think is dirty thoughts
And its not that I don't know that it's really wrong
But its right there for me every time I'm logging on
I got all your CD's I really like your songs
Well I downloaded em but anyway moving on
My screen name is KJ-52 is the bomb
I want to do a website KJ rock's dot com
I really some help cuz I can't tell my Mom
Oh by the way my real name is

[Hook]
I'm writing this letter
Cause I have to tell ya
I need some help from you
I'm writing this letter
I hope that you get it
I need some help from you

[Verse 3]
I took the time just to write you
We play you every Wednesday at my youth group
I love your music and we all think that you's cool
But I been struggling ever since I moved to a new school
See everybody thinks that I'm the perfect Christian girl
I had a hard time trying to believe that God is real
I've been on mission trips and camps the whole deal
My dad had cancer tho I prayed that God would heal
But he died anyway so it's hard to feel
Like he cares about me so was it God's will
To take away my dad I really got a raw deal
Sometimes I just want to swallow all my mom's pills
When I pray I really doubt it
I've lost my way or maybe I've never found it
I been smoking and drinking nobody knows about it
By the way my name is _____ don't mispronounce it...

[Hook]
I'm writing this letter
Cause I have to tell ya
I need some help from you
I'm writing this letter
I hope that you get it
I need some help from you

[Verse 4]
If I could write to every kid that's out there
Every kid that's hurting feels like nobody cares
I would tell them that God can wipe away tear
And he's right near and I would say it quite clear
Your here for a reason you're not a mistake
You are a special creation that God himself made
To the victims of abuse to every girl that was raped
You can live you can be free from your pain
And find strength and no longer be ashamed
You can find peace and hope In Jesus name
You ain't gotta live with this hurt every day
Christ came to give you life in a much better way
To every kid right now that's full of hate
And bitterness I'd tell em just to give it all away
To the one that came to take all the blame
That's what I'd write here's what I'd say[Intro]
It's Fivetweezy, KJ Fivetweezy
It's Fivetweezy

[Verse 1]
Well, I've been gone but I'm back again
It's been too long, you wondering where I been
Well, I betcha I though I would pack it in
Since I got dissed on MTV for dear slim
Aw, man why'd yall play me?
TRL, you drive me crazy!
Now everybody really hates me!
I thought we were friends, Carson Daley?
So when I tried out for American Idol
I got up and sang for Simon Cowell
But he said I was 'absolutely horrible'
He said I was worse than William Hung, too
Now what do I do, please help me, could ya?
I keep getting punk'd like Ashton Kutcher
Since my name's still bashed and butchered
But I was just changing, so listen would yah

[Hook]
It's Fivetweezy, KJ Fivetweezy
It's Fivetweezy
That's what my friends just call me
It's Fivetweezy, KJ Fivetweezy
It's Fivetweezy
That's what my friends just call me

[Verse 2]
Now I don't know if I'm past my prime
I'm feeling old, I just turned 29
It's crazy; I think I lost my mind
Cause lately it shows I forget my uh:
Sometimes I feel like my brain is missing
Sometimes I feel like Jessica Simpson
Don't know if tuna's fish or chicken
I told ya it's five two, nobody's listens
Okay, you don't believe that it's true
Even my mom still thinks it's fifty-two
Now I tried to explain but it's no use
At least the kids say 'man your cool, ha'
No, really man, I can't complain
Kids take puff paint and write my name
On their t-shirts and they be like WAH!!!
That's why it's time for me to change

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I used to come through my system blasting
People couldn't miss it when I tried to pass them
In a Honda civic with the muffler dragging
Shoes off, hairy feet like Bilbo Baggins
Back when I was living wrong
I need to get tipsy like J-Kwon
But know a days all I need is God
And a mic and a DJ and my I-Pod
All righty put your dance shoes on
And everybody just get your groove on
We'll rock the party till the break of dawn
And even get your grandma to sing along
Now what I say, don't take this lightly
God runs things, not Bruce Almighty
He's Jesus, the only one I need
Now Fivetweezy, yall know what I mean

[Hook]

Kinda, kinda fast or in slo-mo

[Verse 3: KB]
Oh-oh-oh-ok G we're the A-Team

So I take the ball, and I'm running hard
And I run for God and I never stop [?]

[Bridge: FLAME]


(In my Gameface)[Chorus]
He went and rose of the third yeah he did that
Gave me all his promise and his word yeah he did that
What you never ever heard? yeah he did that did that
Well then it's time that ya learned that he did that did that

[Verse 1]
Eh yo the kids back this cat can only claim he did that
I only aim to give back the holy name with this fact
I'm a state with this rap "Jesus came to fix that!"
I was lame sin stacked but right now since that
I found the way crossed it tossed it and then passed
The sin of up on my life just at the cross where he nixed that
Like rocking two different types of socks is a mismatch
Is you trying to ice out ya watch with some thick stacks
Now you's up a creek with no paddle on a big raft
Think you got a handle on ya life and you can kick back
But dude here's a sample of advice I wouldn't risk that
You're lies are the Whopper but you far from a Big Mac
I ain't a thug but I hangs with the riff raff
To attract em like a bug to the light with a lit match
Now ya life may break apart in pieces like a Kit Kat
But that's why Jesus came to free us from the sin trap

[Chorus]
He went and rose of the third yeah he did that
Gave me all his promise and his word yeah he did that
What you never ever heard? yeah he did that did that
Well then it's time that ya learned that he did that did that

Now he was beaten he was bruised but never hit back
Can u see the lashes that been used now on his his back
Now everything that happened he went through cause of this fact
That he's so deep now in love for you he went and did that
Now everything I ever thought was cool I threw in his trash
And let him dump it out just to prove I never been back
Now the pain and all the hurt I ever knew it's just been since smashed
Since I went and gave it all up to you I've never missed that
Now forever I'm a live up with you its evidenced that
Whatever I'm a lift up to you I always sense that
That together I can live through any storm life gives back
When I remember that the veil has been torn when you finished that
And you got the perfect timing on and on like a click track
Whether or not my problems kind of big or small like a Tic Tac
Now I could try and count all ya done but never list that
I'd rather get my hands up to the one and steady lift that and say..

[Chorus]
He went and rose of the third yeah he did that
Gave me all his promise and his word yeah he did that
What you never ever heard? yeah he did that did that
Well then it's time that ya learned that he did that did thatHe walks in then he closed the door
He wanna quit but he can't cause he wants some more
Now the way that he lives no one would know
He keeps it hid so the kids won't see it shown
Now he trapped by his sin everywhere he goes
He addicted to skin so he overdosed
Now the way that he lives and the chains that hold
Leave him trapped in a prison that he can't control
Now seeing these women but without they clothes
Leaves him shamed but his brain just remains controlled
And every day it's a strain but it seems to grow
He wanna change but he stays in his chains and froze
He's conflicted afraid feels alone
So he quits for a day but when he's back at home
Then he's back to the same it claims his soul
He wants to break from his chains but it gains a hold he says...

[Hook - Rob Beckley]
Now I seen too much take it all away
Now I need you're touch to help me walk away
Help me change I know I been living a lie
Don't wanna be the same open up my eyes...
Open my up eyes...
Open up my eyes...
Open up my eyes
Open up my eyes...

These things will infect your eyes
But don't think that it's just gonna effect the guys
Cause the girls in the world will ingest the lies
Now it starts when the heart gets compromised
Now the lust and the pride and everything inside
Makes ya look anywhere anyplace to find
Anything that will fill up a void in life
But when you tore up it's sure ain't hard to hide
Next time when the boy she's textin'
That textin' turns into sextin'
That sextin' creates such a mess and
It leaves her mind in a state of depression
She's blind can't see that the lesson
Every time there's a message she's sending
Of exposing her body her flesh and
Leaves her caught in a place of deception

[Hook - Rob Beckley]

It used to be in the magazines
Now it's all just seen on computer screens
And it all just means that we're sure to be
Bombarded w/ the scenes we ain't supposed to see
Now supposedly it be stronger than cocaine
So we drawn like moths to slow flame
Wind up with loss and no gain
Try to stop but wind up w/ no change
No shame so we go full throttle
And feel the pain from the pill we swallow
Girls get it from they romance novels
Guys get it from they swimsuit models
Yet we still feel broke and hollow
Just living like there's no tomorrow
All shattered like some broken bottles
But there is a path that I hope they follow...

[Hook - Rob Beckley][Hook: SPZRKT]
Welcome to the island of the misfit toys (x3)
Yeah
Land of the broken girls and boys

[Verse 1: KJ-52]
I'm sittin' in detention feeling like the breakfast club
Staring at my desk wishing that I had a hug
I wouldn't pay attention but what i paid for love
But when you're searching for some hope man, that junks a drug
Awkward, introvert, really had nowhere to turn
Crumbling, insecure, struggling with the hurt
Stomach all up in a churn rumbling up in my shirt
Wishing that I had a girl but all I ever get is burned
They say nerds gotta wait they turn
And I'm heartsick while I'm living in a dream deferred
My heart gripped in pain
Mouth full of curse words
I can't get away until I read the first verse
Of Your word, then I learned of my birth curse
And that you died for me, and all my net worth
I realized my need just to make a second birth
I bowed my knee and said take away the hurt

[Verse 2: Marty]
Goes out to you, brother
Yeah, I know I got a bad reputation
Walk around, always mad reputation
Make a pretty girl, sad reputation
Probably should be dead reputation
But life moves fast, and if you blink, you gon' miss it
Miss the pain in the voice if you don't listen
Sittin' by myself at the lunch table
Wishing that I had some real friends but I knew that I didn't
I try to do my best, I don't fit in
I realize now, I'm a misfit
But what would you do in my position
When it all falls down and you're the one that it's hittin'

[Bridge 2: KJ-52]

[Verse 3: FERN]
From a place so vulnerable where I'm coming from
About to break down I'm feeling so overdone
Lost my young boy, but joy showed up in the morning
And all of a sudden my burdens just weren't important
Got to live life, fly high where the eagles are
And me out here pointing where the steeples are
Yeah, been overlooked wishing they would notice you
Doing everything in your power to get a hold of you
Rejected by the world accepted by the Lord puttin' numbers on the board
And we're misfits 'til it's finished
And I love you and hope you get to hear this

[Bridge 3: Marty, FERN & KJ-52]
This is for the cutters
The goofballs
Runaways
Lonely
Miserable
Bullied kids
Feeling like the old me

Lovers
Thugs
Block huggers
Killers
Stuck up in the prison
Listen
Don't you forget
You are loved

You are loved[Verse 1: Michael Tait]
Separated, I cut myself clean
From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams
Been apprehended by a spiritual force
And a grace that replaced all the me I divorced

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
I saw a man with a tat on his big fat belly
It wiggled around like marmalade jelly
It took me a while to catch what it said ‘cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head
“Jesus Saves” is what it raved in a typical tattoo green
He stood on a box in the middle of the city and he claimed he had a dream…

[Hook]
What will people think when they hear that I’m a Jesus freak?
What will people do when they find that it’s true?
I don’t really care if they label me a Jesus freak – there ain’t no disguising the truth
No I ain’t into hiding the Truth

[Verse 2: Michael Tait]
Kamikaze, my death is gain
I’ve been marked by my Maker, a peculiar display
The high and lofty, they see me as weak
But I won’t live and die for the power they seek

[Verse 3: KJ-52]
There was a man from the desert with naps in his head
The sand that he walked was also his bed
The words that he spoke make the people assume there wasn’t too much left in the upper room
With skins on his back and hair on his face, they thought he was strange from the locusts he ate
All the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak until the king took the head of this Jesus freak…
[Hook]

[Bridge: Michael Tait]
People say I’m strange, does it make me a stranger?
My best friend was born in a manger

[Outro]
What will people think (what will people think?)
What will people do (what will people do?)
I don’t really care (what else can I say?)
There ain’t no disguising the Truth (Jesus is the Way)[Intro]
Ladies an' gentlemen now put your hands together for KJ-fifty two
Uh... actually it's 52
Oh I'm sorry i meant KJ-90210
No it's KJ-52
Oh excuse me excuse me KJ-U571
No your not hearin' me it's 52!
Oh I mean KJ-AK47...
Man just pay attention man, listen, listen

[Hook]
My name is KJ AKA KJ five two
My name is KJ it is so nice to meet you
My name is KJ AKA KJ five two
My name is KJ it is so nice to meet you

[Verse 1]
My name is KJ... five two
Brown hair eyes of blue
20 lbs. clocking in at six foot two
You can catch me watching Veggie Tales sipping Mountain Dew
Spending too much money at the mall and Gadzooks
Now I'm rolling through McDonald's I'm getting a number two
But I know they gonna act rude and mess up my food
"Here's your cheeseburger and plus your coke too"
Ha ha thanks a lot but where's my fries at fool?
I tried to grow a mullet way back in high school
I was like "Now everybody gonna think that I'm cool"
And the girls are gonna say "You're cuter than Tom Cruise"
But instead they laugh at me like the Sponge Bob dude
Looking back I don't know just how I made it through
But you live and learn, that just what you go through
Cause nowadays kids be like "KJ rocks dude"
My name is KJ...everybody stay tuned

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My name is KJ five two
Now ya'll be messing up my name
It's not fifty two it don't stand for King James
I waited too long now so let me explain
John 6:9 let me break it down plain
Five loaves two fishes is what the boy gave
So I took what I had and I just did the same
Put it all in his hands and I just walked away
I said Lord it's all yours you can have the whole thing
I know what I bring it might sound a little strange
But I'm not in it just for this money or the fame
Feel just the same ain't nothing ever changed
I still drive a mini van and nah I ain't ashamed
Sipping Lipton Iced Tea dipping switching lanes
Like an insane soccer mom about to hit the game
Yelling at the lame drivers saying "Get out of the way"
My name is KJ y'all know the name

[Hook][Intro]

[Heath]
Yo, KJ

[KJ]
Yup?

[Heath]
Take your shirt off

[KJ]
Okay

[Verse 1: Heath McNease]
(C'mon)
N-I-N-T-E-N-D-O
Lock the doors, bar the windows
I'm thinking 'bout one thing this week though
Mario Bros. 1 through 3
And Tetris and Metroid, I destroyed
I'm the best boy, bring it in your chest boy
Next up, Legend of Zelda
Then hit it up with a little bit of Double Dribble
2 points, 3 points, 2 buttons
Don't touch it, I'm rough with this
Switch from B to A to A to B
With the speed, don't play with me
Digits are blistered again
Soak them in vinegar and liniment, then begin again
Sensei of Ninja Gaiden, I've been playing it since ten
Kung Fu guru, 8-bit Mega Man
Malevolent manic competitor
I'm a veteran at it
If you know better than that then sit down, go practice
"That was the baddest!"
Thanks Mom, aren't you glad to know
That your son's the bomb at something
It's better than nothing
At least it ain't dragons & dungeons

[Hook] x2
I've got Nintendo thumb
Dang, dawg, my thumb's so numb
This controller is controlling me
It makes me feel so dumb
Why don't you come get some?
I know that you don't want none
If you did, you'd get it cause I'd give it to you
Sit down, son

[Verse 2: KJ-52]
Got my Nintendo Thumb (yup)
I got my Power Glove (okay)
I'll BMX rollin' up, homie show me love
Show my homies up, I'll blow my homies up
I got it straight made, eighth grade they growin' up
Man, I'm straight paid, Grape Aid up in my cup
Now what you lames say? Watch me go an' show you up
Nintendo gangsta watch me buck-buck Duck Hunt
Mike Tyson, punchin', jabbin', hookin', the uppercut (ow)
Now wassup wassup
Ain't hearin' what you sayin' (nah)
Door shut stuck inside, tv all day (day)
What you punks say? You think we gon' play?
Chump its left, right, up, down, A, B, B, A
What you gon' say? (nuttin')
You could never touch me (nuttin')
You gettin' blown out like a cartridge that's dusty
Man, it's gettin' ugly
My homies 'bout to fight
All because my game tight
Man, it's on tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Heath McNease]
I mastered the 8-bit masterpiece
When I was a little kid I was bound to be
A digital athlete, it came naturally, I didn't ask to be
Gifted when I'm kicking it with Kid Icarus, I'm victorious
Or I won't play at all, I won't take a loss
I won't push pause, I'll turn the game off
RBI or Tecmo Bowl or Bases Loaded, it's game over
Never gonna be intimidated, innovative is my middle name
A legitimate claim
I'm bringing the pain, call me Top Gun
I hunt ducks with a shotgun
Not a pistol, you're pitiful, I'm Robocop, that's literal
Girlies whistle cause I'm a fit as a fiddle, nerdy and burly
And surely they don't deserve me
If they can't come in first place
On Excitebike, I'm the type of guy who can
Cover my eye and beat you by
A couple of miles while you're struggling while I'm chuckling loud
Can't you see, you ain't got a chance with me
I'm a pro, you're amateur see
Mark my words, thinking you can handle me
It'll be your Final Fantasy

[Hook]

[Bridge: Heath McNease]
Contra, Castlevania, DuckTales, WrestleMania
California Games, Shinobi
Get a Power Pad, you still can't hold me
Who's dumber than this?
Whose thumb's number than this?
Who's the next chump on the list?
They'll get the beating of a lifetime
One that they're not gonna forget

[Outro: Heath McNease]
Get your thumbs up! (x8)
(ahh yeah)[Intro]
Yo son
What's up son?
Yo son check out my man's mini-van!
Ah that's that new mini-van son!
Yo he sittin' on like ten-inch rims son!
Ten-inch rims son!
And he got on a Wal-Mart throwback
Yo where'd he get that Wal-Mart throwback?
He got like five-inch speakers up in that thing
What's that kid's name?

[Verse One]
Man, y'all should know who I am
I stay thugged out rollin' out in my mini-van
With my ten-inch rims buggin' out with my little tan
While I'm lettin' 'em spin, Mountain Dew can in my hand
Man, I'm iced out like what?
Well I was iced out when the ice fell out the cup
But I can't help it, I almost ran into a truck
And the ice all melted, the mini-van got stuck
But it's cool, I let my speakers bump
Dude I got five-inch 'woofers in the trunk!
And we still make the party people get up and jump
KJ-Fivetweezy, you know he get it crunk

[Bridge]
Mini-cans is in the house y'all
Mountain Dew is in the house y'all
Ten-inch rims is in the house y'all
Five-inch speakers is in the house y'all

[Hook]
I'm just a plain white rapper
Nothin' more, nothin' else cause it really don't matter
I'm just a plain white rapper
Nothin' more, nothin' else, I don't try to be an actor
I'm just a plain white rapper
Nothin' more, can't you tell, no it ain't Marshall Mathers
I'm just a plain white rapper
Nothin' more, even still you can quit your chit-chatter

[Verse Two]
Fivetweezy
You know the name
'Sup to the soccer moms all up in the place
Driving SUVs, Camry, Lex or the Range
Man, I just bought my CD on the way to the game
You don't have to act your age
Get your hands up, make your kids think you strange
Start dancing, get 'em really now ashamed
Pick 'em up from school, honk the horn, be like "Hey"
Okay, back to the track
I'm a kid in a cap and a Wal-Mart throwback
Yeah, what y'all know about that?
Man, I be putting Cape Coral, Florida on the map

[Bridge]
Soccer moms is in the house y'all
Homeschoolers is in the house y'all
Wal-Mart is in the house y'all
Southwest Florida is in the house y'all

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Ain't nothin' special 'bout me
Ain't the best lookin', ain't the best MC
Now, I'm not a hoodlum, flashy or icy
At the dentist, the only time I get flossy
See all really got is just Christ in me
Who precisely breathe life in me
Just guides me daily and nightly
And never fails me cause he holds tightly
And I know it's just a sight to see
Don't seem right, don't even seem right to me
But all it just means is God gets the glory
And in the end that's all I'm living for, end of story

[Bridge]
Fivetweezy is in the house y'all
T-Cleezy is in the house y'all
So get ya hands up in the house y'all
And let's turn this party out y'all!

[Hook]Verse 1(Kj52)

Say what you wanna say its plain I ain’t never worried
I got my hands up and down like it’s 12:30
And they can go ahead and clown that could never hurt me
Ain’t nothing but sound I’m rolling out just on my journey
And I ain’t never hurried cuz see I’m on my way
I’m swimming upstream going out against the grain
And that’s what happens when you going in a different lane
You never mixing well like Listerine and Gatorade
So Let them haters hate man they just some people
I got a passion now for Christ like its Jim Caveziel
I got a passion now for life and now there’s none equal
Hes coming back that’s the fact that’s the one sequel

[Hook]

Shake em up shake em up now shake em up
Shake em up shake em up
Shake em up shake em up now shake em up
Shake em up wake em up

Verse 2(Thi'sl)

Might seem just kind of strange might seem just kind of plain
So When u see me all you see white ts and wallet chains
But when I'm speaking oh you think this kid is kind of lame
But let my life just speak out scream out and call the name
Might seen a lotta pain might seen a lot shame
But its just Jesus he's the reason that I gotta claim
He’s what you needing for your life to see a lot change
And like the phoenix you can rise speeding out this flame
Here’s why he came cuz you need this doctor
See man is sick w/ sin and he can treat it proper
The problem is though we don’t ever even seek the father
You got the point yadda yadda now we gonna[Hook]
Its the Tweezyman
They call him Tweezyman
Its the Tweezyman
They call him Tweezyman (get get down)

[Verse 1]
Oh no here we go again
I was rolling in when he was going in
He was like "Oh no man I know you’re him
Let me go to the door and get my older friend"
Held it in with a grin is what I went and did
When he came back fast with another kid
I had to laugh when he asked as I shook my head
He was like "Ain't you the dude from Rob and Big?"
Hold it kid man I think you’re blind
You got me confused with another guy
I went and looked at the dude when I said I rhymed
And he was like "Yo! Kevin Federline! Whats up?"
Ya need to check ya eyes
Step back get the fact then you’ll recognize
Cause I’m back to attack what you expect to find
It’s the new and improved KJ-supersized

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Take it back to the 1980’s
When my hair was black and wavy
Way back when I was acting crazy
I was mad couldn’t attract the ladies
These girls about to break me
You wanna know how they’d play me?
"I was hoping for Patrick Swayze
But instead I got Kevin Spacey..."
Ooh baby whoop dee whoo
Nowadays when I straight come through
All I hear is "how old are you?
All my friends say 42."
"42 are you crazy mad?
Ya crazy rude where’s ya brain just at?
I’m 34 in case ya asked"
"You’re old enough to be my dad"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Whos the man a w/ a grasp of grammar
Who writes songs on a pack of pampers
The only rapper loved by yo grandma
Haircut like adam sandler
No matter how you gone see me
What I wrote is the hope that you see he
Whether CD, live, or 3D
Just Jesus put him on a repeat
Don’t believe me I keep rehashing
This junk just keeps on happening
You can just keep keep on bashing
While the world just keeps on laughing
But I’m a just keep on rapping
Till the hammer pants back in fashion
While the crowd just keeps on packing
Its just Jesus the focused passion

[Hook]
