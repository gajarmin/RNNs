[Hook]
Damn damn damn James

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Dickie shorts and Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, blizzes lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out here come the folks (Damn - oh lord)

[Verse 2: André 3000]
As the plot thickens it gives me the dickens
Reminiscent of Charles a lil' discotheque
Nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia a lil' spot where
Young men and young women go to experience
They first li'l taste of the night life
Me? Well I've never been there; well perhaps once
But I was so engulfed in the Olde E
I never made it to the door you speak of, hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems
And the troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set it Off," in the right
But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it
"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song"
And the crowd goes wild as if
Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance (sliced up)
Two niggas don' start bustin' (wham wham)
And one nigga don' took his shirt off talkin' 'bout
"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Courts?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations (that is)
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute[Pre-Hook x2]
When that liquor get po’ up
And that green get roll up
When them sets get throwed up
I’m like nah man, hol’ up
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff
Better hope they don’t call my bluff
Cause my mind is going crazy
This shit is never enough

[Hook x2]
Never enough, never enough, never enough
This shit is never enough

[Post-Hook: Woman]
Not even, not even, not even, not enough [x4]

[Verse 1]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
At the party with my homies, walk up and they play my shit
On the road, kick a song, didn’t have to sell my soul
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
Where you stay, every day, just got my crib in LA
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh
Bitches on my dick, don’t give a fuck, y’all must not know what’s up
In the cut, we don’t give a fuck, we just trying to cut
Line em up, if they say they bout it then we’ll sign em up
Rattpack, that’s a fact, basic bitch can’t fuck with that
Where you at? That’s what they be asking, I say on the map

[Bridge x2]
Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Drop that new shit just cause they demand it
Living like we got it cause we get it
Do it just to say we fucking did it

[Pre-Hook + Hook + Post-Hook]

[Outro: Thalia]
This album was created over the span of one year. However, the majority of the album was recorded in only two weeks[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks - thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

[Hook x2: Sleepy Brown]
I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail, on the low ho

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]
Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine (look so fine) look so fine
You driving me out my mind (out of my mind)
Out my mind, ooooh baby
If I could I would just be with you baby
Oooh cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo!

[Hook][Intro - Sleepy Brown]
This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin uh
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin
To look sexy, but even if she was so what
Mother fucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
Girl you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
You hoped to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the southern states, you know where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit does not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your Speakerboxxx
Pink and Blue, you're lolly gaggin, you're slow pokin
You got me open, you're playin wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if I need a baker bring's the joy, you're a kiner, the Tyner meanin the real McCoy
I can't wait

[Sleepy Brown]
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

Ooo baby, come on
Got plans tonight (plans tonight 4x)
Anticipated, the love and I'm gone get it
Till the mornin light (mornin light 4x)
Come on baby

You're always on my mind
Cuz baby I can't wait, I can't wait

I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

Ooo its been too long now baby
Lets seize the night (seize the night 4x)
Cuz I'm gonna take you on a journey
Enjoy the ride (enjoy the ride 4x) enjoy the ride
Up and down (ooo baby!)
Up and down (whoo lady!)
Round and round (take it..)
Round and round (whoo)

For your time, you're so fine
You're always on my mind
Cuz baby I can't wait, I can't wait

I can't wait, no can't wait

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Sir Luscious is the real deal, but even he gets antsy
Some honeys try to Kill Bill beneath the underpants see
But patience is a virtue to being anxious, just might hurt you
Like Mike Vick returning to the line of scrimmage too soon
A line of niggas tryin' get in Vision on a full moon
Should I play it cool, or be the one to make the first move?
Anticipatin, and contemplatin, she got you sprong dude
Shit, I'm fin to get her might even hit her, what you gone do? (wha?)
I tell you what, we won't be fallin for that one, two
Just kinky sex up off in the boom boom if she want to
And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
That means find another face to replace, cuz I can't wait

[Sleepy Brown]
This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)

Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double D-Y Fat Sacks
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some eardrums
The game done changed
Outkast came to heat it up)
Sharp as a tack like I just left church (clean)
Sharp than a tack what a nigga want murk?
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some eardrums
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
And everybody wanna know whats really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?
So on and so on
I can go o-on and o-on
And on, and on, and on
Hell yes!

[Hook: Scar]
Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby
Sayin' hey baby
So baby please believe me
Don't you go (don't you go)
Baby no no no (baby no no no)
My heart is like a marching band

Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby
Sayin' hey baby

[Verse 2: Big Boi] + (Sleepy Brown)
Two dope boyz in the Cadillac still
'Kast ... the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
Fire marshall
Shut her down, time to go!
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still that's fire
Hot like the perm on the back of your neck
Left it in too long
Now ya got Cabbage Patch silky
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some eardrums
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique
Got the pedal to the floor, but the 4-door just creeps
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some eardrums
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Exotic, melodic melody yep, we got it
Fuckin' for the funk of it and everybody want it
Roof you make me wanna put a dog on it
Roof you make me wanna put a dog on it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scar]
I'm tippin' my off to ya baby
Cuz you're so fine, blow my mind
I put in the time
Everybody knows you can't let a pretty one pass you by
Without sayin' hi
I'm so gone over you
Yes it's true
Baby do what you do
My nose is open so wide (so wide, yeah)
Lookin' at you such a pretty sight (so wide, yeah)
My heart is on my sleeve (my sleeve, yeah)
And this is how it sounds to me (this is how it sounds)

[Hook]

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Baby you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church up back to your feet
So wait baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait baby
Don't leave me, baby
[2X]Yeah, uhh
Think I'mma try somethin that I ain't
I ain't never did before on this one
Let's go

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)

[Ludacris]
Got a little bit of blueberry yum yum
And I never woulda thought that it could taste this gooooooooood
Thank God for the man who put it in my hooooooood
It's got me singin melodies I never thought I woooooould
I'm feelin sorry for the homies who be smokin woooooood
Chop chop, break it down for a player like ye ye ye ye..
I'm 'bout to find me a woman and skeet skeet skeet skeet..
I'mma keep smokin 'til I reach my peak peak peak peak..
Or 'til I'm stuck and my body feels weak weak weak weak..
Headed down to the Dungeon, wonderin, if they got some mooooore
And if they don't then I'mma haveta, settle fa, some 'droooooo
But it just ain't cool cause right on after, I'mma have-ta go
And continue on my mission fishin for the yum yum but I'm movin slowwww

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Yes fire fire got me so tired, I'mma stop drop and rollllllll
Put a wet towel under the doooooooooooor
Don't pass it I can't take it no moooooooooooore
Somebody take a trip down to the stoooooooore
Hurry please, cause I need some snacks snacks snacks snacks..
And how long will it take it to get back back back back..?
Yes indeed, I'm a little off track track track track..
Off this weed, and I'm full of that 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac..
Get on in that stankin Lincoln, crank it up, and riiide
And it ain't enough room to fit the, other chicks, insiiiide
I'm so hungry with the munchies I'mma eat eveyrthing, in siiight
Me and my blueberries together and everything's, alriiiiight

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Get the propane, roll dem thangs, and let's blow dis place uuuuuuuup
You already know what'suuuuuuuuuuuup
I mighta had to pay some extra buuuuuuuucks
But I really don't give a fuuuuuuuuuuck
Cause a brother feels great great great great..
But I'm barely awake wake wake wake..
All bent out of shape shape shape shape..
So stomp on yo' brake brake brake brake..
If you tokin good then all the smokers, let me see, your flame
Don't know what you got but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame
All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean, a thang
You can't compare it don't stare cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane

[Hook][Intro]
What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

[Verse 1 : André 3000]
You make me understand
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

[Hook]
Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

[Verse 2 : Sleepy Brown]
Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get ever drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Big Rube]
My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love
Till ain't nothing but Stankonia

[Hook][Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jacking off cause you ain't there

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Cruising down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talking bout meeting at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em a good game, juju pimping
Give em to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S
A D. and an A. missin' out my Adidas
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumping brooms

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, boom

[Hook][Hook - Sleepy Brown (Bubba)]
A fifth of Beam when you celebrate (That's white thangs)
Poppin five, didn't hesitate (That's white thangs)
Sippin Henn, swervin wood grain (That's black thangs)
But to me, it's just all the same (It's all the same)

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Damn, what a difference a year and a hundred and 12 days makes
Came the longest country mile, thanks to nothin they gave me I made breaks
Basically baby, I've been great, this ain't no recent development
But now it's official, I'm the doo-doo;
And you ain't gon' keep 'em from smellin it
Do you have a speaking impediment bitch, or are you just at a loss for words
Oh-no actually I'm monogomous, all that talk was false you heard
So don't stall betty just slurp, of course I'mma tell you when
Oops my bad that's my mistake, I was just gonna tell you then
I just bought me 5 new Polos, cuz see I'm partial to that logo
That horse is just so Bubba, that means rural like you don't know
Regardless though I'm gon' glow, even in my birthday suit
And when it comes to that soft, yes sir'ee I circle that too
So when you feel it poundin in yo' chest and it causes a slight pain
Just shake it off and smile I got'cha, doin the white thangs ok

[Hook - 2x]

[Backbone]
I'm outdoors early mo'nin sellin this country crock
Let's get this understood, gotta get me off the top
I got them break down dimes and bomb with twenty-fives on the block
Of that 'naw that hawd, talkin 'bout that glass that straight drop
Bartender, send me Remi, Henny or straight shot
Then see me flee, high speed from eight cops
Leave 'em floored, showin how I'm opposed, y'all can't stop
Jumped the fence, went down the path, came out by Ms. Dot 'partment
Ay, ay Bubba Sparxx shoot we down to the spot
Them young G's up on that corner, done made the porch hot
Them folk say they sweepin, seekin 'He who hold stock'
Ay, run tell shawty, cut off, close shop
I told them boys down there, homes in the van was a NARC
Tell 'em "Naw we don't sell that shit round here doc"
They bout four cars deep, sittin in the Croger parkin lot
But we know when they comin, cuz money bark a lot

[Hook]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm seein more clearly now, how subtle the difference between us might be
Mr. Fat Face got that big weight but still that seem just like me
I'm doin my thing dispite these, little lifestyle expectations
Y'all chose to set for me, shit I'm headed to where my next check waitin

[Backbone]
Look here, beat me I'm old school like LL J beatin off in your Regal
With six eights cross the deck, hittin, sittin on fifteen inch eagles
And Vogues, case closed, order one mo' get drunk, throw bo's
We in here puttin on, all night y'all 'til the place close

[Hook - 2x]

{*music plays*}

[Hook - 2x]One.. Two.. One..Two..Three Lets GO..

[Hook - repeat 2X]
Back in the mud again, I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away

[Verse 1]
It's just that country boy, city slick
Hot boy, temperament
Add the pony, add the flame
Either way it's an event
If it's me consider it
Pardon the coincidence, even though they mumble at me
Suckers keep they distances
Father, Kay Hey
What's that they say
Hip hop redneck that's a safe place
Say what makes you comfortable
With me cause I like it here
How about a rural dwelling, urban music pioneer
Turn it up, let it bang
Run with me, I bet you can't
Took too much to make it float
Never will I let it sink
So we reinvented it
Boy are we generous
Hoping that my moment pass
I can see the end of it
25 years of life, I was born yesterday
Loving life, doing right, earning every breath I take
Standing in the mud again, cause it seems to pay me well
Playing with my not so distance cousins from the ATL AHHH..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ah Yea, Ah Yea
Press it up
Ship it out
Call the pony
Rent it out
Everything I Am today
Is what I've really what I've been about
Athens Georgia Resident
Native of Lagrange though
I don't love the Peach State, brothers say it ain't so
Naw, Sir, In Fact it's quite the opposite
Loving yall from Brunswick, Up to the metropolis
Can't forget about my Betty Betty in the ?
That put them triple X's at the end of Andy's Monica
How can I run from, everything that made me
Knowing all the love I get is appreciated greatly
Now witness something truly inconceivable
Bubba International, but still he kept it regional
Trying to make my momma proud
Ricky Lathens see me smile
Gotta make sure this next CD is the fire
Making sure everyone one of my talented associates gets what they deserve
Nothing short that's appropriate YEA!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Get your cup, fill it up
Soda don't appeal to us
But if your broke, do what you can't that alone still enough
Help us out if your rich, cause we about to pitch a bitch
Just stop by the store and grab a case of that, a six of this
Hey Betty get it ready, cause you daddys in route
Let her join the Beat Club, peep that lil trim out
Have her screaming new south, with out pulling loot out
He always wonder what you doing, let him wonder who now
At the end of the day, I will have no regrets
Got it done on every front, and I ain't even focused yet
At the bottom of the pond, swimming with them mud cats
If you dive in I'm perusing for a grudge match
Spell It out L-E-G-E-N-D, I still believe
What ever goal God set for me, indeed I will achieve
Either in this life, for in the next
Whether drinking Gin or Becks
Bubba fin, to bring it home, still you can send a check

[Hook]Yeah, uhh
Think I'mma try somethin that I ain't
I ain't never did before on this one
Let's go

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)

Me and my blueberries together and everything's, alriiiiight

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Get the propane, roll dem thangs, and let's blow dis place uuuuuuuup
You already know what'suuuuuuuuuuuup
I mighta had to pay some extra buuuuuuuucks
But I really don't give a fuuuuuuuuuuck
Cause a brother feels great great great great..
But I'm barely awake wake wake wake..
All bent out of shape shape shape shape..
So stomp on yo' brake brake brake brake..
If you tokin good then all the smokers, let me see, your flame
Don't know what you got but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame
All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean, a thang
You can't compare it don't stare cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane

[Hook][Intro: Sleepy Brown (Big Boi)]
Girl you cut up (Lucius Left Foot)
Girl you know you cut up

[Hook 2x: Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Nasty Noompsy Knightingale
Fresh in that tuxedo
Cummerbund with no suspenders
My torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this dick tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Whatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where i's...

[Hook 2x: Sleepy Brown]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Oh, lord! How can it be so hard??
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perserverance and experience to get that cat!
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack!
As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance
We look fine, right on time
As we step in the place the nursery's crunk we've come to play

[Verse 3 : Sleepy Brown]
Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me!! Throw your hands up if you feel me!!
Cause we well designed, like the finest wine
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny
So raise your hands to the sky cause we super fly

[Hook 2x: Sleepy Brown][Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
When the lush hangs off the chrome
I know that you're gone - ya feel me (feel me)
Fifteen years off in this game
Still nuttin changed - feel me (feel me)
Ridin swiftly through the night (through the night)
And livin this life - feel me (feel me)
Whether, I'm right or wrong (I'm right or wrong, I know I know I know I know)
I know that you're gone - feel me (I know ya feel me)
Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, ohh (whoa whoa whoa)
(Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, wow)
Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, ohh (whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, wow)

[Big Boi]
Damn, and that wasn't nothin but the intro
Here we go[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna f--- something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It's the player from the point
And your girl from the D

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Are you infatuated with me?
I could end your curiosity?
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

[Hook: Beyonce']
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

[Verse 3: Beyonce']
Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I give you time?
I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

[Hook]

[Break]
Undress me undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin down they sugar walls
Aw naw! getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots in stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me "p" pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!

[Break: Sleepy Brown]
The way I feel
Oh girl I know its bout to be
Me all over you
And damn girl you all over me

[Hook][Intro - Sleepy Brown]
This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin uh
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin
To look sexy, but even if she was so what
Mother fucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
Girl you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
You hoped to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the southern states, you know where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit does not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your Speakerboxxx
Pink and Blue, you're lolly gaggin, you're slow pokin
You got me open, you're playin wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if I need a baker bring's the joy, you're a kiner, the Tyner meanin the real McCoy
I can't wait

[Sleepy Brown]
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

Ooo baby, come on
Got plans tonight (plans tonight 4x)
Anticipated, the love and I'm gone get it
Till the mornin light (mornin light 4x)
Come on baby

I can't wait (the way you love me)
I can't wait (the way you touch me)
I can't wait (I can feel it)
I can't wait (all over me)
I can't wait (come on baby)
I can't wait (please come home)
I can't wait (tonight)
I can't wait (whoo)

For your time, you're so fine
You're always on my mind
Cuz baby I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait
I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

Ooo its been too long now baby
Lets seize the night (seize the night 4x)
Cuz I'm gonna take you on a journey
Enjoy the ride (enjoy the ride 4x) enjoy the ride
Up and down (ooo baby!)
Up and down (whoo lady!)
Round and round (take it..)
Round and round (whoo)

For your time, you're so fine
You're always on my mind
Cuz baby I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait
I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Sir Luscious is the real deal, but even he gets antsy
Some honeys try to Kill Bill beneath the underpants see
But patience is a virtue to being anxious, just might hurt you
Like Mike Vick returning to the line of scrimmage too soon
A line of niggas tryin' get in Vision on a full moon
Should I play it cool, or be the one to make the first move?
Anticipatin, and contemplatin, she got you sprong dude
Shit, I'm fin to get her might even hit her, what you gone do? (wha?)
I tell you what, we won't be fallin for that one, two
Just kinky sex up off in the boom boom if she want to
And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
That means find another face to replace, cuz I can't wait

[Sleepy Brown]
This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you
Where are you now
I've been looking for you
Come through, get you
Riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you
I've been looking for you

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Let me give you one to grow on
Me and you have been digging each other now for so long
Like an archaeologist looking for our bones
We used to do it to the slow songs
Then our hormones would mix up from the sweat
Cause I feel it drip drop from my pecs to your chest
I send a text from the jet
Just to get you slippery
Memories of you soaking wet
That's the only time I might slip
Then I slide between them thighs
She keeps it tight-lipped
Like a vice grip, it's so private
Mum's the word unless I'm knee deep inside it
Three's company not crowded
I get cake, eat it too and apple pie
Slices with the ice cream, icing, à la mode
She inspires and excites me now you know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
(On some cool shit)
Well here's a revolutionary idea
Why don't we both stay home
And if the doorbell goes ding-dong
We can act like we not here
Put them house coats on and take them right back off
As a result, like we work at Ikea
Test every piece of furniture to see if it is stable
You wanna take it out on me then do it on the table
Blow to the head is fatal
Wait til, you get a load of me
I ain't joking, Dark Knight, Batman
And I'm poking that pussy Cat Woman
Poke-it-man, baby gon' push it back on me
Hoping that maybe you'll wake up in the morning
And forget about it all
I hate to see you sad so if anybody call
Tell em that you'll let em know
When we fall back to earth, go berserk, baby

[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]
I've been looking for you
Come on in
I've been looking for you baby
Where you been
(Where you been)
No more wasting time
Let's gone and get it in, get it in
And I won't stop, don't stop
Til I make that leg drop

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yeah, they wanna follow in my footsteps
But I'mma go something like the Boogie Man
Never forget that
You musta fell down and bumped your cranium
Been moving crowds, rock halls and stadiums
Maybe I'm one of the best you'll ever meet
The Greatest Show On Earth, B.I.G
And I'mma make you remember me
I stay colder than December, B
Mr. Freeze, only want to see her on her knees
Through pregnancy, are at a all time high
Keep it sci-fi, wi-fi
Always connected to muchacha, watch out bwoy
The time flies by as the Cadillac glides
It's the Return of the Jedi
Niggas know better
Antwan and Andre together
Dungeon Family for the Dub-i-ya
I-N, like Khaled all we do is win, win

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
I-I-I be on it, in and out it, in and out it
In and out it, in and out it, went about it
Like I owned it, dog it
Gone it, dog and pony show
Said my name repeatedly, repeated me
Like Tony Toni Toné
Tony, Tony
I know, I know, I know
I said two too many Tony's
I go, I go, I go
I’m not usually a morning person
But certain skirts can makes me
Pull back the curtain and let the sun burst in
She searching for her Ken, Barbie
Her skin makes my Berlin Wall fall down
To the ground, now to shave artly
A one night stand, number on nightstand
She ain’t gon’ never leave me hanging like an old white man
But she don’t understand that I’m a fan of Steely Dan
And she like everything that’s on the radio and I demand she change it

[Outro][Verse - Big Boi]
Five o'clock, but I stopped at 4:59
Twist a J of some hay, got a car from Sleepy Brown (Brown)
See it's going down downtown at the lounge
It's definitely crowded with that happy hour crowd
Drinks for a dollar, everybody buzzin' cousin
Spitting like a major league pitcher trying to cut something
Only throwing balls, no strikes for tonight
So walk into the Chevy for some heavy petting let's ride!
To my underground bungalow, approach the mound
Baby I'm the head coach now, wow! baby need a cold wet towel
Pharrell's on the way so stay and play a while
Yeah.. uh, Sleepy Brown, Pharrell, Big Boi

[Hook - Pharrell Williams]
I been working all day, now I'm done, so see ya!
It's time for play, name the place I'll meet ya!
We can do the bar, sip margaritas
Stay on the floor, go when we feel right
Aren't you feeling nice? Doesn't it feel nice?
Is everybody high?

[Verse - Sleepy Brown]
Go on baby, do your thing now
Sitting at the bar, where was you hanging?
I wonder if, you know I'm watching you
Cause everything you do is so beautiful
Oh, the way you run your fingers (over that glass)
Oh, the way you look over your (shoulders when you dance)
I'm trying to get the nerve, to talk to you
So maybe we can, find something to do

[Hook - Pharrell Williams]
I been working all day, now I'm done, so see ya!

[Verse - Sleepy Brown]
Don't worry baby, I'm here my lady
Starin' at your eyes, trying to read your mind
Don't you realize? I'm right for you
That type for you, one that makes
All your dreams reality baby (will go as planned)
Then we'll turn this thing into a (serious romance)
I'm - here for you my babe, what do you need?
You're every wish, ooh girl I would need

[Hook - Pharrell Williams]
I been working all day, now I'm done, so see ya!
It's time for play, name the place I'll meet ya!
We can do the bar, sip margaritas
Stay on the floor, go when we feel right
Aren't you feeling nice? Doesn't it feel nice?

Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double D-Y Fat Sacks
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some eardrums
The game done changed
Outkast came to heat it up)
Sharp as a tack like I just left church (clean)
Sharp than a tack what a nigga want murk?

Beatin' like some eardrums
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
And everybody wanna know whats really goin' on

And on, and on, and on
Hell yes!

[Hook: Scar]
Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band

Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby
Sayin' hey baby

Baby no no no (baby no no no)

Two dope boyz in the Cadillac still
'Kast ... the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
Fire marshall
Shut her down, time to go!
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still that's fire
Hot like the perm on the back of your neck
Left it in too long
Now ya got Cabbage Patch silky
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some eardrums
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique
Got the pedal to the floor, but the 4-door just creeps
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some eardrums
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Exotic, melodic melody yep, we got it
Fuckin' for the funk of it and everybody want it
Roof you make me wanna put a dog on it
Roof you make me wanna put a dog on it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scar]
I'm tippin' my off to ya baby
Cuz you're so fine, blow my mind

Everybody knows you can't let a pretty one pass you by
Without sayin' hi

Yes it's true
Baby do what you do
My nose is open so wide (so wide, yeah)
Lookin' at you such a pretty sight (so wide, yeah)
My heart is on my sleeve (my sleeve, yeah)
And this is how it sounds to me (this is how it sounds)

[Hook]

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Baby you and me

So wait baby

[2X][Pre-Hook x2]
When that liquor get po’ up

When them sets get throwed up
I’m like nah man, hol’ up
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff
Better hope they don’t call my bluff
Cause my mind is going crazy
This shit is never enough

[Hook x2]
Never enough, never enough, never enough
This shit is never enough

[Post-Hook: Woman]
Not even, not even, not even, not enough [x4]

[Verse 1]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
At the party with my homies, walk up and they play my shit
On the road, kick a song, didn’t have to sell my soul
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
Where you stay, every day, just got my crib in LA
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh
Bitches on my dick, don’t give a fuck, y’all must not know what’s up
In the cut, we don’t give a fuck, we just trying to cut
Line em up, if they say they bout it then we’ll sign em up
Rattpack, that’s a fact, basic bitch can’t fuck with that
Where you at? That’s what they be asking, I say on the map

[Bridge x2]
Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Drop that new shit just cause they demand it
Living like we got it cause we get it
Do it just to say we fucking did it

[Pre-Hook + Hook + Post-Hook]

[Outro: Thalia]
This album was created over the span of one year. However, the majority of the album was recorded in only two weeks[Hook - Scar]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Verse 1- Big Boi]
I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger couple of kids in minivans
Standin in the stands like a fan watch her little man
Run ball... And everytime you see the family they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had her cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the (hide) the spouse in the house
Boy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
(Motherfucker shit gotdamn asshole)
Took my shit (Too Short sample: Beeitch!) FUCK!

[Hook - Scar]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Verse 2 - Big Boi]
It was the night that they done dipped and all throughout the palace
That didn't do his part heartbroke or no more marriage
When it happens you'll be slappin yourself rememberin
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you sittin in the courthouse plaintiff and defendant
Pleadin to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin was splendid see she was grinnin and spendin
All of her time wit the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate
Friction wishin I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't
Damn... fuckin around

[Hook - Scar]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Bridge - Sleepy Brown & Scar]
Girl you have to remember
I gotta provide for the family and future
So please stay down and please stay around cause you know
That I'm tryna change but its hard cause I've been this way
(Big boi: Man you already knew that shit)

[Hook - Scar]
Stages in life no one said that it was right

{*music to fade*}[Hook: Ludacris] + (Sleepy Brown)
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Grease don't pop on the stove no more, moved on up
Double shot Hennesey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I wild out, WHAT THE FUCK?!
How you goin Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna ack like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like aftro-sheen
But they don't never really wanna pop them thangs
Cane, cane sugar man Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pull off so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that dro
So, daddy come home in a Cadillac brome, cadillac brome?
Now don't it sound absurd
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms, then bend them curves
Chop chop, chunk it up fat man herb

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's illegal bout the plants in my backyard grow, that's my bud
Smoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck
Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, NIGGA WHAT?!
Act like I don't make clout, how you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But, I guess what you really don't know don't hurt
With a vest, and a pump hear the shot gun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (they got that work)
Don't it smell so good, in Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good
And come through flossin, they wish y'all would

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Worldwide hustlers get that dough
Work that tip, get rid of evidence, move that brick
Keep a D eagle with an extra clip
Think it ain't so, SUCK A DICK!
Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gonna act like I don't push lacs?
Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on BACK!
Ichy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a Glock I'mma make 'em say please
In the back, on block so the cops they freeze
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, you gotta nose bleed?
Don't it smell so sweet?
In DECATUR, where they pack that heat
And ROB neighbors in the night creep, creep
I'll see you LATER we'll be in them streets...

[Sleepy Brown]
Here I am, you know it's me
The focused-out brotha with the pinky ring
People stare, women scream
Cuz they never seen a brotha be so clean
Gangstah hats, minks to match
Glass half full just sippin now
Big Snoop Dogg bout to fuck you up
Me and Outkast just lay in the back
In the Cadillac, grill intact
Purple-blue gators, and belts to match

[Andre 3000] (Sleepy Brown)
Some people play crazy, some people play like they sane
It doesnt matter (play in the rain) we always play in the rain
Too much of data can make the mind overload
Scramble all logic not even you can decode
(Where are we going, can we slip and we slide?)
It doesnt matter just shut the fuck up and ride
I am, a multi-pimp, so fresh so clean
Rimp rimp rimp
In a .. (Cadillac, grillin tag)

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg] (Sleepy Brown)
I woke up early on my birthday, pimpin in the worst way
Never come in last place, usually come in first place
First they chase me, lace me, and taste me
Kick me some brandi, keg me and lace me
Face me, look at me, now tell me what you lookin at
A P-I-M-P, and wing-tip Stacey's
Lately, hate me, is all that they could triple with
Know them niggas best to hit, that I'm the ones to kick it with
Runnin high, tell a lie, watch the P I stay outside
O-U-T-hills now, dirty see I still slide
The bitches love the way we ride
So if you ain't a big dogg, then I suggest you stay in cells now
I be, G S-N-double-O-P, E-S L-B-C you feel me
You can't sell me, tell me silly gilly hilly billy
??, While I slide in the 6-9
(Cadillac, grillin tag)
(Purple-blue gators, and belts to match)

[Big Boi] (Sleepy Brown)
To the window's to the wall's, to the bathroom nigga dont fall
The cast gone keep on bumpin and dumpin, to post up on all of y'all
Got my nigga Snoop Dogg, L-B-C
College Park, E-P-T, on the remix tip we gon' sit
On the rim tip and wing tip, like a boss pimp, not a lost pimp
Cuz I, (So fresh so clean), wearin hard shoes, or not at all I
(Live, walk with a lean), take godzilla and the gator from lake placid
Manifacturing in a fashion, mashin might be stabbin
You crabbin, your girl is stabbin and frabbin I'm snappin and trappin
Deba, depana, dashin, all I need is a congac, and a cold coca-cola
Slashin, smooth serious smashin, multi-rubels matching
Toot that bootie, I'mma toot the horn, I'm a player
Every time they ask me am I (Cadillac, grillin tag)
(Purple-blue gators, and belts to match)
Two times, (Cadillac, grillin tag)
(Purple-blue gators, and belts to match)

[Hook][Hook]
Damn damn damn James

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Dickie shorts and Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, blizzes lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out here come the folks (Damn - oh lord)

[Verse 2: André 3000]
As the plot thickens it gives me the dickens
Reminiscent of Charles a lil' discotheque
Nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia a lil' spot where
Young men and young women go to experience
They first li'l taste of the night life
Me? Well I've never been there; well perhaps once
But I was so engulfed in the Olde E
I never made it to the door you speak of, hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems
And the troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set it Off," in the right
But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it
"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song"
And the crowd goes wild as if
Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance (sliced up)
Two niggas don' start bustin' (wham wham)
And one nigga don' took his shirt off talkin' 'bout
"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Courts?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations (that is)
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute[Intro]
What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

[Verse 1 : André 3000]
You make me understand
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

[Hook]
Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

[Verse 2 : Sleepy Brown]
Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get ever drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Big Rube]
My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love
Till ain't nothing but Stankonia

[Hook][Pimp C: Hook (2x)]
Don't wanna be disturbed
I got my swishas & erb

Sipping lean, Smoking on some pine
Gurl I'm Pimping, Got money on my mind
Game is crazy, niggas gazy, I got heavy fire
(?) put one on it Bitch it's still five

[Hook (2x)]

[Bun B]
You know Bun B the business street soldier in the trenches
Frontline coming down on twenty four inches
Dope boys hanging on the corners and the benches
Saying it's a drout so it's plenty of heat pinches
Boys used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now its like the game is full of nothing but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters thats scared to put'em in ditches
FED's taking pictures so the cameras go click
And video rolling while I'm holding my dick
They follow me around like they doing they job
But while you watching me how many people getting robbed
Lets keep it trill cause we already know
What it already is and how it already go
Thats why we chop blades coming down real slow
Pop trunks, swang, riders slam cadillac door
Pass the swisha lets blow

[Hook (2x)]

[Sleepy Brown]
Before we get started, Every body roll up one for Pimp C
Before we go any further, Take yo lighter light it up for me
Now lets go (lets go), Now lets go (lets go)
And all the girls get down on the floor (on the floor)
Throw your money in the air and let'em know (let'em know)
Throw your money in the air and let'em know (let'em know)
I'm whipping big wheels (wheels), Whipping big wheels (wheels)
Hope your drink don't spill whipping big wheels (wheels)
Tell me how you feel (feel), Tell me how you feel (feel)
Put the (?) on the lady on my side
And if you all down for me, Put your hands in the air raise'em up for Pimp C
And if you all down with me, Put your hands in the air raise'em up for Pimp C

[Hook (2x)][Hook - Sleepy Brown]
Everywhere that I seem to go, all people they know
There goes that man
Cadillac's steady move, all ladies choose it
There goes that man
Been all around the world and I kissed every girl
There goes that man
Girl this ain't no kind of allusion, it's really that man
There goes that man

[Verse 1 - Duddy Ken]
Hey, when we step up out the play man
We bring that monster A game
Switchin or say through lanes
Green on my shirt like Tulane
Drunk and drivin in two lanes
Dirt Reynolds, that's the new name
Dip out and handle a few thangs
Bet I come back a rich man
Some of these cats is bitch made
My shift be like a switch blade
The doors, open this way
That man, went that a way
Chase cheese like a rat race
Push my button like there
And that's gonna get you nowhere
Just like you fuckin yourself
I've been all over the globe and hit a lot little spots (spots)
Met bitches that love the nigga, that's if she fucked me or not (not)
Trappin what's in my spot (spot)
Not movin, just got me no dough
It's like my money was slow mo'
I bought a car and got Mobile
My city's up on my shoulders
I'm takin life as we know of
Tranformin into a whole 'nother world and time
Beat up tracks and murder rhymes
Don't dare close the curtain, cause I'm just beginnin
Bubba was the beginnin but bitch I'mma end it
Hey, I'm that man, man

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit, I'm a Dodge Rammer, god damn if I ain't two and 0
I'm competin and momma's eatin, so am I losin? No
But shit was movin slow, I had to switch machines up
Destiny don't always match with the shit you dreamed up
But Bubba ain't no cream puff
In my life, I've seen much
Held the thrills and the spills
Through it all, I kept it trill
Guarantee I never will ever feel as helpless
As I did these last couple years, I know you felt this
Really don't expect no forgiveness for "Deliverance"
Then again I offer no apologies, I meant the shit
Cause I lived the shit, truth is truth and that's the end of it
I'm up and runnin, bet my jersey's in the rafters when I sit
Watched it when I get a hit, everybody benefits
I'm far removed from innocence, a year older than twenty-six
Pussy just remember this, I ain't chose the path I'm on
If you want it, come and get it, as that man I stand alone (oh!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Duddy! Haha
Uh huh, hey say, hey let the guns play
I just came with "Me, Myself, and I" like Beyonce
Let these suckers run they coffee coolers, I'm the truest
Country motherfucker, bust and kill the talk, it's time to do it
Everything your idol do it, I can do it cock eyed
Three albums supplied, once I have not lied
That should mean a lot right?
Maybe when they open up the books, I can get a look
You must admit, I'm dope as fuck, true I ain't devoted much
Of my raps to dope, I'm just a little to preoccupied with the truth, you know what's up
Sorry but I know this much, Bubba K is sen-sat-ional
That shit ain't no bull
Ain't no bull that I can't pull, I am him
That'll be the case, if I'm ridin rims or shinin them
Bubba baby, more trouble baby, ha I love you hate me
Ask your lady, is it maybe her that I've been pluggin lately
Fucker (*echo*)[Produced by Cy Fyre]

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ain't it crazy how your life seems to play out like a movie
I'm truly one of the baddest motherfuckers to ever do it
Done did it, gone do it again, and can't nobody stop me
Cause I occupy these streets while these niggas they rhyme bout shopping
Been a handsome-ass nigga since my Mama wiped my bottom
Kept a plethora of pussy on deck before the money
Or monies, greens, bills, dividends and such
Operation grind and stack cause these rappers are out of touch
Or like a rabbit that just lost one foot to a keychain, out of luck
My tail is never tucked, so fuck niggas beware when ya buck
Let's be clear, I'mma keep it straight up player like a gentleman
But I won't go back and forth, east, west, south, north

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
When my feet touch the ground
When I peep all around
And I'm feeling all loved
Yeah, I'm feeling all loved
From the way that you stared
For the joy of that I'm there
And I'm feeling all loved
Yeah, I'm feeling all loved

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Yeah, it seems just like yesterday, where did the time go
I'm giving you the best that I got, Anita Baker rhyme flow
It's time for that new, new shit that y'all been dying for
Divine flows, the radio got y'all like zombies
Come alive, hoes, like a litter full of puppies
Or a baby with a onesie on, your old lady clumsy, holmes
That means she's falling for Daddy Fat Sax, wanna show me some
Sweeter than some honeycombs, she wanna be the queen bee
The numero uno sitting on her throne next to me but ain't gotta be easy
Why I got a seat for her, right in my naked lap
Reverse cowgirl, she ride it then make her booty clap
I'm breech birth, feet first, nigga with each verse
Been ten toes down to those familiar with the sound
So Shazam me and then you Google Dungeon Family
And when you do you will understand I'm buku outta my noodle
With this pad and pen, and boy you penciled in
You're temporary, substitute and we can't fit you in, let's begin

[Hook]
