[Verse 1: MØ]
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

[Pre-Chorus 1: MØ]
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus: MØ]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

[Verse 2: MØ]
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

[Pre-Chorus 2: MØ]
But the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus: MØ]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

[Bridge: MØ]
All we need is somebody to lean on
(We need someone to lean on)
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

[Chorus: MØ]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on[Verse 1: Natalie Bergman]
Let me escape in your arms
Baby I'm yours, baby I'm yours
Love don't come easy at all
I missed you so much, I missed you so much

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, woah

[Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together

[Verse 2: Natalie Bergman]
He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Wings spread to the sun
I miss you so much, I miss you so much

Chasing after danger, making my heart race, woah

We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together

[Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together[Intro: Travi$ Scott]

Heading downstream till the levee gives in
What can I do to get the money
We ain’t go the money, we ain’t gettin out

Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearin’ thin
All I need’s relief
I need, I need some sympathy

Look at me
I just can’t believe
What they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be

Look at me
I just can’t believe
What they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

All of my life been wadin' in
Water so deep now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long how long till we have a friend

Comin down feelin like a battery hen
Waves won’t break till the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise
What will I do without my dreams

Look at me
I just can’t believe
What they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be

Look at me
I just can’t believe
What they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me

I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Oh my, my, my, what you do to me?
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above

[Pre-Chorus: Tarrus Riley]
Oh lord have mercy, I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jump-start my heart with your love

[Chorus: Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding x2]
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

[Verse 2: Ellie Goulding]
I couldn't leave even if I wanted to
Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers, the scent of your lingers
My mind roaming wild, the thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some
Or you can give it all, but it’s never enough no

[Chorus]

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
Hold me in your arms
Burns like a fire, electricity
When you’re close I feel the sparks
Takes me higher to infinity[Intro]
Heyeyyy, I say, smoke it everyday, we're on

[Hook]
Smoke the weed, everyday
Don't smoke the seed, no way
Smoke the weed, hey
Smoke the weed

[Verse 1: Snoop Lion]
Younger generation
Young boys and girls
Be careful of the seeds you show
If you want fi see a strong tree grow
You gotta prepare for the future
Show respect don't neglect mother nature
All the pollution in this world
Me just can't stand it
Global warming make the whole world panic
Take care of mother earth cause'a she be the planet
Youth man don't go astray
Fresh trees, young seeds all tryin to find the light
Stretchin out their limbs to the sun, acting right
Help them keep their life on track
Watch over like a satellite
Tell them when to stop and go like a traffic light
Many obstacles to overcome in the city life
Making sure they stay pure, teach them what's wrong from right
Seed brings forth new life

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Collie Budz]
Say around 6am in'a the morning
When we just'a wake up
Stick the peer pockets me darling
The baba hurt me break up
Holding my fight, the herb me can't stand it
Me'a solely see babylon can't come step on it
Me'a mix the weed with a lit' Grey Goose and tonic
Yute man, no stop on the chronic, everyday
Aya aya aya, hey man roll the weed up
Take off you shoes, me mix a couple breed up
Can't stand when some boy go pffff on the seed oh
We no do that, we get cheat oh
And me say, herb herb what we all prefer
Them'a juggle it on every street curb
And the yute they say: weed is life
Weed is reality

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Lion]
Early light papa, youth dem'a suffer
Dancing, my top off, hot like the summer
You can never understand why we live to light
You would never recognize unless you see the fire in my eyes
I'm burying the man, like every single day
Black birds in the sky, can't get a fucking break
The smoke is my gun that's how I blow them away
Music is my weapon, rewind and let it play
Babylon, the police, sun set the whole day
They call me Snoop Lion, I smoke everyday

[Outro: Snoop Lion]
We keep planting these seeds
Watch them grow a new breed
Cultivating these trees
The cycle carrys on
And on and on and on, it don't stop
The tick tock of universal clock
To the bang bang boogie of the life streaming through me
And the songs that wait while we procreate (sex)

[Hook][Verse: Snoop Lion / Cori B.]
Money makes a man and that's a crime
If we all were rich, we'd spend more time
With our daughters and sons, they're losing their minds
We all feel hurt, here's mine, hear me now

[Hook: Snoop Lion / Cori B.]
Cause, no guns are allowed, in here tonight
We're gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd, in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud

[Hook: Snoop Lion]
Let the music play, me don't want no more gunplay
When the bodies hit the ground, there's nothing left to say, ay, ay
Me don't want to see no more innocent blood shed
Me don't want to see no more youth dead
Come hear me now

[Hook: Snoop Lion / Cori B.]

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, news from back home
This when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Cryin' and sayin' to leave him alone, but I'm not leavin' his side
I know that somebody died, somebody's child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks 'em
They just can't wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour sumthin' out for the lives that they stole
416

[Hook: Snoop Lion / Cori B.]

[Outro: Snoop Lion / Cori B.]
Money makes a man and that's a crime
Money makes a man and that's a crime

[Verse 1]
Yo! When I was young and my dad had a reefer house
I’d catch a contact and talk like Eek-A-Mouse
Go to school act like I’m pulling reefer out
Kinda funny cause I used to freak my teachers out
Like "dong dong diddy dong dong", seen?
So much mi go teach ya bout
Peace to the one Black Chiney and the Heaters out
In the club, everybody on Sinatra
Look around, everybody on Sinatra
I ain’t talking bout this shit they call Coke and vodka
I’m talking bout the shit you snort and go "ha ha ha ha ha ha ha"
I mean just go bonkers
Make the young girls wild, and then go topless
Make the dope boy smile, they don’t need binoculars
Make a nigga wanna pull out choppas
Brrap brrap brrap they got ya

[Hook]
Ring, bom bom bom bom
Aerosol can, bom bom bom bom
Monkey outside, bom bom bom bom

Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Banging on that ass like orangutan
Motherfucker transform to a grown man
And transform again like

[Verse 2]
Skateboard, can a nigga make more?
Steal my style? I ain’t got no reward
Like hmm, make yourself bigger like mushroom
Mario Kart
All y'all niggas wanna get like me
All y'all niggas wanna spit like P
Missin' ass niggas wanna hit like me
Meanwhile yo bitches wanna kiss my D
Child Rebel Soldier hit that ass for the combo
AK-47 and the dress on a rhino, boom
Commodore like Lionel, zoom
Hauling that ass like a new Veyron
Am I wrong?
Riding with my bitch mane, all night long
One second I’m here next second I’m gone
That’s two in 60 seconds nigga what you want?
Girls on me like they superglued on
My dick like a table you can place food on
Make Szechuan, or Hunan
Nigga I’m hot like the place Mulan

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga I’m hot like the place Tucson
BBC ICECREAM skewed on
No discounts, no coupons
But I got the Rolls Royce for the Grey Poupon
Now you jealous with your face screwed on
Who on? Nigga you on?
Feeble ass niggas only get booed on
Shitty attitude get pissed and pooed on
Fucking with P? You wrong
Retreat nigga, you don’t wanna feud on
Your nerves ain't there for a big dude on
Stompin' that ass until you gone
Hoping that you make it home wit' yo shoes on
While I’m tourin' these booties, scoring these movies
I know that I made it when I’m chilling with Stewie
Ask Marc Jacobs what I did for Louis
Sunglasses, campaign and jewellery
Ask Alber how he really wanna use me
Comme Des Garçons, ain’t using it loosely
Look at your forehead, sweating profusely

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?
(Major Lazer)
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waitin' for this
On the rocks upon the mountain tops

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
You're always on my mind, oh, there'll come a day
Day where we can fly, reach the glory haze, oh, hey
High up in the sun in the brightest sky
Sun in the brightest sky

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus][Verse 1: Snoop Lion]
Tonight there's gonna be a whole lot of smoke in the air
Blow it high for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we putting one six feet underground
So bless
What goes up must come down

[Hook: Miley Cyrus]
Now my buzz is gone, and I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So put 'em high, and reminisce
You're gone, but you're never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So raise a glass to the memories and set em' free
And fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays

[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]
Tomorrow when you wake up and realise life ain't fair
Throw it back and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had, 'til it's gone
That is why, something always will go wrong

[Hook: Miley Cyrus] x2VERSE: BLESS
I remember back when I met Rob like it was yesterday
Skeptical with trust, but it’s a must to keep the stress away
Dude was a heavy smoker
I’m sober as if I haven’t seen a family member with at least Heineken and a bag of weed
Sad to me, but I was too young to see through their eyes
You really must be a superhero because humans can’t fly
Unless they’re inside a plane; but planes crash sometimes
Here comes that feeling of pain when they’re gone and you see the sky
And just let it all go…

VERSE: SNOOP LION
Tonight, there's gonna be a whole lot of smoke in the air
Blow it hard for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we're putting one six feet underground
So blaze - what goes up, must come down

Drop it low put it in the dirt
Sex drive put it in reverse

Then I drove off and put it in the dirt
Drop it low put in the dirt
Take your top off turn into a vert
Bubble butt, busted in her throat
Smoking bubble kush wearing a bubble coat

[Verse 2: Mystic]
Wind, go down, turn and flick it
A girl like me know how fi handle di wicket
One bat, two balls, swing it like cricket
Pull me locks, slap my ass, make me show you how me wicked

Make you vibrate like a Nokia
When me whine and bruk off that buddy yah
Uh huh, even kartel a happy yah

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 3: Mystic]
I had a cute thing, buenas noches
By the end of the night my knees are now on your chest
Fuck me bad, let me in, a cardic arrest
Make me come
Make me come
Come, we know you are the best
Who's bad?
Let me wind upon your cock
Tick-tock-tick, riding the clock
Beat it, beat it, beat it bad, let me show you what I've got
I ain't Snoop Dogg, but I'mma drop it like it's hot

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 4: Tyga]
OK, open up your Bubba Gump, let me see your bumper
The booty so smooth, can't believe is not butter
I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer
I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burpin'
I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface
I load in my clip in and told her, 'Don't get nervous'
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy, bang, Bang, bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker
Ball like a dribble
Put you on a pickle, nibble on my dickle
Why you're tripping? I'm a crazy individual
Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too
Damn, bitch, talk much, I don't want interviews
I'm trying to get into you (into you)
Then make you my enemy
Not playing, got the bitch mad
Me don't like flat screen, ass I need a 3D

[Hook x 2][Intro] (Bird & A-Game)
Oh shit...
What?
A song about some big booties...
Mhm!
They done fucked up!
Fo sho!
You got a big booty? I'm a smack that thing and make you go...
*SMACK* AHH! Hahaha
Bubble Butt!
Skrewz Loose bitch!

[Hook] (A-Game & Bird)
Girl, go ahead and drop it down now!
Girl, you know my fuckin' background
I'm a freak like her thick in them jeans
I'll do anything you want, you just gotta say "Please"
Go ahead and twerk it like you in the club
If you got a Bubble Butt, then you know I'm showin' love
Yeah baby, drop that B-Bubble Butt
We Skrewz Loose, don't make us go nuts, huh?!

[Verse 1] (A-Game)
She got a bubble butt I'll show her what the fuck is up
I'll stick it up into her gut, then pull it out and bust a nut
Hit the shower, get cleaned up, and play a little rub-a-dub
Yeah this girl can suck and fuck she bang my dick like it's a drum
She need a minute, cause her legs are kinda shaky
Drop it to the flo' but just make sho' that you don't break me
I'm a fuckin' freak I'll be bringing my A-Game, see
I hit it good the first time, and then you'll try to rape me!
I really love the milfs, they mistake me for a baby
They think I ain't about it, just because I'm young at eighteen (ha!)
She got it twisted, I'll treat her like a princess
And then I'll have her screaming loud in every position
Nails digging in my back, you'd think I was possessed
By a demon, but she's screaming tellin' me that I'm the best, yes
I can go all night, she's the one who needs the rest, bet
That I put in work and barely even break a sweat (yeah!)
Yeah I might be new, but don't mistake me for a rookie
Call me Sid the Monster, cause I'll take your girl's cookie (OMNOMNOMNOM)
I'm shy and quiet and that's why you overlook me
Until you hit my bedroom and I work out that pussy
And we ain't lifting weights, but we sweat the same
Make her say my name, then nut on her face
I kill the box, man I'm bout to catch a murder case
And when I'm done? Hit up the Bird and see if she can run a train (let's do it)

[Hook] (A-Game & Bird)
Girl, go ahead and drop it down now!
Girl, you know my fuckin' background
I'm a freak like her thick in them jeans
I'll do anything you want, you just gotta say "Please"
Go ahead and twerk it like you in the club
If you got a Bubble Butt, then you know I'm showin' love
Yeah baby, drop that B-Bubble Butt
We Skrewz Loose, don't make us go nuts, huh?!

[Bridge] (Bird)
Now I love drugs, alcohol
Pussy, shit you name it
...But there's one thing I love
AND THAT'S A BUBBLE BUTT

[Verse 2] (Bird)
I love me a bubble butt, drop it low and bring it up! (yeah!)
How the hell you get tight jeans to button up? (I'd love to know!)
I take 'em off, quicker than you put em on (ok)
We in the bed fuckin' so hard, we fell off! (ow!)
Molly picked me up, so my bitch got jealous (shut up!)
Quit trippin' ho! Cause really? I could care less (bitch!)
I fuck her 'till her hair is a mess (uh oh)
She gets pissed, so I told her wear a hairnet... bitch!
I can out-drink anyone at the party (you know!)
I stay fucked up, like I'm on a sober diet! (you know!)
I smoke loud shit, homie stay quiet (shit!)
If you got a gram of good, homie I might buy it (for da low!)
I don't fight, but when I do I start riots (ok)
I'm on the top, feeling like a fucking giant (ok)
Hell yeah I'm high, I should be a pilot (ok)
I stay faded, so all you see is eyelids (I'm high!)
Yeah I handle my shit, all I do is sit back
I'm never sober cause I always tend to relapse (uh oh!)
Roll a blunt, dip it in the lean, then light it
I'm on a bean with a freak, gettin "X-Cited" (rolling!)
She gotta bubble butt, you know I like that!
I could tap all night, from the back yeah!
Yeah she like me, I don't like her
I love pussy, money, weed - what's the word? Bird!

[Outro] (A-Game & Bird)
Yo, your girl's cute, but she's all up on me
I can tell that she's a freak, she be beggin for the D
Afterparty at my crib? Yeah we smoked all of your weed
For free, you couldn't get with her, that's why you had to leave, ha!

I smack it, fuck. and pass it, who knows who has it now
I need a bubble butt, if you don't have one? Then get out! (bitch!)
I smack it, fuck, and pass it, who knows who has it now (I don't know)
I need a bubble butt, if you don't have one? Then get out, goodbye![Refrain : Black M & Bruno Mars]

[Couplet 1: 2 Chainz]
Drop it low put it in the dirt
Sex drive put it in reverse
Killed her ass put it in a hearse
Then I drove off and put it in the dirt
Drop it low put in the dirt
Take your top off turn into a vert
Bubble butt, busted in her throat
Smoking bubble kush wearing a bubble coat

[Refrain]

[Couplet 2: Black M]
L'endroit est plutot salace et on me demande de rester cool
J'ai les yeux plus gros que le monde donc forcément plus gros que ton boule
Laissez faire Lucifer
En récompense vous aurez que de moi que le Black Stifler
Là tu pourras dire que j'ai du culot
Interdit aux moins de 75 kilos
Cousin si elle lache facilement son bigo
Dis toi que forcément son parcours en dit long
C'est pas moi le XXX, c'est toi la ...
T'es comme Domina qui en redemande à Crixus
Bref, ne m'invitez pour vous clips
Car c'est dans ce genre d'ambiances que Monsieur X a fini tricard
Casse toi, dégage on a pas l'humour d'Bigard
Y'en a pour s'mer-ca, ils se terminent vers Pigalle
Infatigable, les yeux toujours big
Si t'es gé-char, tu fais le poids, Black Stifler te big up

[Refrain]

[Couplet 3: Tyga]
OK, open up your Bubba Gump, let me see your bumper
The booty so smooth, can't believe is not butter
I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer
I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burpin'
I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface
I load in my clip in and told her, 'Don't get nervous'
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy, bang, Bang, bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker
Ball like a dribble
Put you on a pickle, nibble on my dickle
Why you're tripping? I'm a crazy individual
Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too
Damn, bitch, talk much, I don't want interviews
I'm trying to get into you (into you)
Then make you my enemy
Not playing, got the bitch mad
Me don't like flat screen, ass I need a 3D

[Refrain][Hook: Mr Vegas]
Girl I’m loving you more every day, can’t stop now
I’ll be loving you more tomorrow, can’t stop now

[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
I get the *shots* like high fives
Leave your *boy* hanging out on a clothes line
Play peek-a-boo through a slit like blinds
And seen his little meat like chicken pot pie
His chicken pox eyeballs fall underneath
Up stack street time to retreat
Meet me in the middle hit the door like road runner
Change my screenname and phone number
Hit your dick with the duce like pop
There ain’t a buck that keeps enough to make *bullet* Okay *gunshot*
Bang, I’d rather *toilet flushes*
Through the bladder
Now pop quick like handsoap lather
No cigs excuse, no niggas on my block
Your condom fit like a skittle in a sock
I haven’t had a tater tot since I ate school lunch
So you can eat the *broken glass* while I face these blunts

[Interlude] (x4)
Oooooooh, Yeah!
(Oooooooh, Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Starvin' Marvin *broken glass* to pull me
Sweeter than ya lass I’ll be your teacup and you know we gotta *gunshot*
Before we gets to feed herbs
You follow, I’m the leader
You Tamera I’m the Tia cause I *gunshots*
You stuck on, dumb dumb! *gunshot*
Better make me *gunshots*
All I want is *broken glass* and then some
And umm…
A set of (gunshot) rings, and them
Excuse me? (gunshot)
Look, pardon me
My bitch is beat like card 3
Make a *gunshot* feel sauced like it’s hard to be
Ya *Broken Glass*
Don’t bother me
Too strict like year-long Halloween
Pull up to Banks like Collard Greens
Broke ones won’t get no far to me
Cheap is what I find hard to be

I'm in love with the coca
Got more hits than Sammy Sosa
Hard to lose my composure
Wake your block up like that Folger's
The Range Rover is cream but with copper tone
Ridin' on chrome, acres home
Two thousand on my hat, on my dome
Got more hits than the Astrodome
Got more hits than that Sammy Sosa
Mark McGwire, 250 in the Dayton wire
I swang the block like I'm Pete Samp
I'm on the green, Versace camper
RiFF RAFF is that HIGHROLLER
Syrup in my soda, chip on shoulder
Been po', flipped out in the Lambo
Gotta make my money fast, can't be slow[Hook]

Tu tas sweet, just like orange crush
Toy adicto a ti, como candy crush
Tu eres automática tu no usas clush
Pepa siete un donkeo como Chris Bosh
Tu me gustas mas que el arroz
Un poco barbudo pero yo no soy Rick Ross
No me hable de huevos que de esos tengo dos
Di que si te regalo un disco de Mr. Fox
Yo tengo una casita en la playa
Habla rápido o para siempre calla
Habla bebe, antes que la otra se vaya
Quiero tu panty pa hacer un batido de papaya

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Yo tengo una casita en el bosque
Cero cadacue déjale esa vaina rocker
Yo se que tu quieres que yo te toque
Entonces habla breve mami, vamos pal choque
Que lo que pata perdiéndome mis tiempo
Mami habla claro si vamos pal cuero
No te confundas conmigo mami
No pienses que yo soy un hombre grosero
Soy un hombre en busca de una mujer como tu
Linda como lucero no te preocupes por na (na na na)
Yo tengo dinero
También tengo un crucero
Mentira es un velero
No te preocupes que tengo licencia de marinero
Y una buena cabina pa cubrirme del aguacero
Vamos a recorrer el mundo entero
Y tengo una mansión
Na un apartamento
Donde vamos a pasar gratos momentos
Donde tu vas a servirme mi alimento
Y donde voy a hacerte el love a cada momento

[Hook x2]

[Outro]I smell bullshit. Must be cuffing season

Verse 1:
Yeah, my parents been apart for awhile
And my brother sometimes make me wish I was an only child
You could beat my ass. It don't compare to the belt
My whole body still numb to all the pain that I've felt
Cards dealt; Heartfelt
I try to rewrite the world's wrongs through a song and pretend like it never went on
It's hard to tell. Are we God or Lucifer's pawn?
What's stupider? Um.. I'm black moved into the white zone
Dating a Russian girl like I can handle this
I'm battling tragedy in my mana it's baffling
Yu-Gi-Oh showed me dueling, but cartoons ain't explain gravity
It's a theory. It's grappling me down. This isn't happening
"I thought I could fly. Starfire made it look easy,"
She said to me, but no decence in the voice of her speaking; just weakness
I told her "Little girl, you can overcome
You might have to wait a little for your next life. Hope for the next one."

Chorus:
Look at me
I Just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just want to dream
I just want to dream

Verse 2:
There is the American Dream and the dream of the black American teen
You were there at the scene of the crime and seen that I've seen
What do you think that means to me? A child sheltered from the streets that glorify the lean
I am the opposite of them, but in a way, I'm still a fiend
A woman just got shot with her child on Tay's block
Two shots. No abortion and they both got dropped
And next door to him, a woman and her two kids getting their ass jumped fast
By their dad's drunk, punk ass
A dream can take you anywhere
So right now, I'm supposed to be sitting on pyramids
As I jump through dimensions like Breach
And breach security to find secrets to preach the way to let things grow meek
Believe that I seek answers that Sophocles couldn't reach
In the search for pansophy maybe man will see:
Pansophy isn't impossible
But most of man's greatest knowledge has yet to be thought of
You got something to say? I'm still looking for my message
I'm speaking in a language that allows no second guessing
I'm running from a world I was born into
Getting free is the easy part, but freedom is the issue
Bobby, I still don't get you
Tell me man what is with you?
When you've been through what I've been through and seen what I've seen
You might understand why so much of this world just brings me spleen

You might know why I wanna save it too

Chorus
X2

Speech - Jaylen (Super Saiyan kid)
This is something that's been in my heart a long time. All I ever wanted to be in life was a Super Saiyan. You know, ever since I was kid, I used to look up to Goku and Vegeta, Gohan. I used to just look at them and wonder, like, how come I'm just a human being? I'm so worthless. We are so limited as human beings. I feel like anything you set your mind to, your mind can create that force because your mind is the powerful machine that whatever you set it to and you believe and you work towards achieving it, you can do it. People that are on my level of intellect, y'all can understand what I'm saying. Thanks for understanding

Bobby: Find freedom.. Bobby Zone..Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
What can I do to get the money
We ain’t go the money, we ain’t gettin out

Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearin’ thin
All I need’s relief
I need, I need some sympathy

Look at me
I just can’t believe
What they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be

Look at me
I just can’t believe
What they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

All of my life been wadin' in
Water so deep now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long how long till we have a friend

Comin down feelin like a battery hen
Waves won’t break till the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise
What will I do without my dreams

Look at me
I just can’t believe
What they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be

Look at me
I just can’t believe
What they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me

I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring him 'round cause her homegirls’ll clown like
“Girl I ain't know you like ‘em bite size"
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think I’m no good for ‘em
Too dark, too thick, too hood for ‘em
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I’m doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about her 5 year plan
She saying “who I’m fooling, they could never understand”
They could never understand

[Hook: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still I’m watching CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep ‘em niggas walking 'round blind all the time
But the same niggas think I’m fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
I’d rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The single's only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day you’ll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out that old sound that I've grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it don’t matter I’m on Saturn now and I won’t shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I’m gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparel
My flow’s thorough, now I’m more aware of all the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates is a nigga fate
And why they call this shit a race
The agony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste

[Hook]

[Bridge: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me

[Outro: 2Pac]
Don't support the Phoneys,Support the real
You know what I mean?
How can these people be talkin about how they so real
And they don't care about our communities?
How can they be talkin about how they're all this you know
The hood and blah blah they don't care about the communities?
You know what I mean? Listen to the words they have in their lyrics
And tell me is that some real shit
And if that's real shit to you
You know what I mean? Listen to what they're saying to you
Don't just bob your head to the beat peep the game
And listen to what I'm saying & hold us accountable for it[Intro : Angela Hunte]
Show no fear, we made it clear
That the warriors are coming and we no play

[Hook : Angela Hunte]
We at war with the army of haters
And when we kill em we just smoke 'em like papers
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now
You might be a lord; but here comes the king
You might be a lord; but here comes the king

Here I come'a steppin in the dance

[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]
They gonna love me
Call me black chutney
All gold chrome with the diamonds in the back
Lil homies in the front dont know how to act
We comin deep and you never see us smiling
10 million strong and we rumble and we riding
Two shots up for my Africans
Been around the world and back again
Feel so good gotta let me in
Power to the people let em kiss the ring
Bow - here comes the king

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Lion]
They know me in Japan and Pakistan
Ganja makes me lord of all the land
Im royalty no need for me to wear a crowm
Born a rebel then I became a man
I heard a voice, he said that I would understand
One king one faith one religion
And if you love me come and join the revolution
One king one faith one religion
And if you love me come and join the revolution
