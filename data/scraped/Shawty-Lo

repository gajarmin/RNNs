[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boilin water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rahstas
More ganja then reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me; Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave 10 birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop em at Moreland Plaza
Whoozy like the morning after, try me then yo skull get fractured
Ransom yo lil hansom son, so sad yo that first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter, but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another thoughta, if you serve me and you shorta
Ounce a half a eigth a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard got from my father, take no shit got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Only one dude and I'mma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay low key and get doe wit my people
Maybe try to find me some blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got love bitch, drop a few pounds
Count a few checks deal them out
Shoot a lil dice, pour a lil out
Sell an Impala make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug everything about my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day they said I wouldn’t be shit
Tell them fuck niggas "nigga look at me now!"
Mami on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don’t make no sense we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club everybody like "wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club I’m stunting on the couch
Balling like a balla me and Gucci ballin' out
Shawty got it for the low who said it was a drought?
Swag run so hard man these hoes like “Ow"
Well known in the North, raised in the South
Connected out West get them in get them out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie Glass
Stupid Brick Squad chickens in stankin' through the plastic
Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper
I’m the hottest thing walkin' around in East Atlanta
So I’m like a baby, shittin' like a damn pamper
They hatin' my swag, cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca cola where’s the water? Watch this doe I serve this order
One on the window, cause the police just might smell this odor
Barber shops and beauty parlors, just to cover dirty dollars
White girl was super dirty, so I put her in the shower

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Soo Woo! To the B Gang, it’s a G thang, see me
I’m eyeballin' shorty, Gucci got the work and Flocka got the 40
Work the wheels, and hold the gun, smoke out my pistol, I wish you’d run
Nigga win some, like which one 100-round chopper or the handgun
Heard I ain’t never lost none, I got nicks and dimes you want some
I’m a legend in the hood like Big Pun, got bales of the mid you want some, I got them
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything
I’m gudda gudda, gudda gudda, I put that shit on Gucci Mane
Brick Squad is what the fuck I claim, God y'all niggas off the chain (Loony)
Lookin' like he want my chain, I smoke him like some Mary Jane
And shorty that shit real talk
And shorty that shit real talk

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Shawty Lo]
Shawty Lo, call me Escobar
They try to retire me like the great Brett Favre
Still got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Even Nicki, fuckin' with my girlfriend
Yeah, we share that bitch
Got Waka Flocka, Gucci, Rocko in that bitch
Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist
And I’m still on the highway, takin' the risk
Back and forth, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20 with a bunch of them bricks
Ayy, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20, all white bricks

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Feds coming after us, niggas talkin bout jackin us
Married to that white girl so bitch I ain’t no bachelor
Brick Squad Re-up Gang, mothafuckin' yayo club
Lookin for another one cause I ran off on my last plug
Off white Jag, white truck, white Lambo
All white Porsche four door going ham ho
You know who I am ho (GOTTI!) You say I robbed yo brother
I don’t give a damn though; he must've had the yams low
He must've had them grams off weighing what I paid for
Too many of them bands now he laying on his man floor
I’m Yo Gotti nigga and I’m from North Memphis
In East Atlanta Zone 6 and I got the North with me

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Nicki Minaj]
I got that hard Gucc, you know these bitches easy
I got that cold flu, I got that itchy sneezy
You in that Mitsubishi, I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm takin' trips with Papi, you walkie-talkie copy
I got them pookie fiends, might rock some Juicy jeans
I mean some Juicy sweats; maybe some blue Giuseppes
I play foul; no free-throw
Bitch I ball, no free show, deadass; no peep-show
Bought our own condo, water-front condo
Daughter, son dundo; watchin' Telemundo
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
What'chu coppin'? Keep that work inside my Pippi Longstocking, bitch

[Hook][Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
Yeah, Shawty Lo and the Big Cats
Yeah, it's the remix so bring your top hat
What you talking bout, it's L-O
I rap now it's rap schizo
Thirty bands, fo shizzo
Eight balls same price as the kilo
I'm a boss, handle my B-I
And I got them same kinda guns like T.I
See I been that way since knee high
Real dope boys so you know I trap or dizzi
No lizzi, I'm hizzi
Like Kells I believe I can flizzy
And yeah I'll see you later
Big ups to all my haters

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Guard your woman dawg or I'll take her
You'll hear her scream from College Park to Decatur
I was a snotty nose with no paper
Now my crib sittin on twenty-two acres
Get it right fool I gets money (yep)
If you think Ludas not filthy you's a dummy (yep)
I was allergic to the roof on the cutty
So I took the top off like a Playboy Bunny
Catch me pimpin in a robe and some slippers
Riding down 85 while I'm stunting on my Gixxer
Mouth full of swishers or riding with your sister
And six David Beckhams or a trunk full of kickers
Take a picture of the mister it'll last long
And these haters get stretched out like a bad thong
So partner mash on or get mashed up
Think you can fuck with Luda then put a million of your cash up

[Hook]
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know [x4]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm in my Cool Whip, inside's Jello
Hop up out that pretty muthafucka like hello
(Hello) Hello, ladies how you doing
That nigga crazy girl, don't say nothin to him
They know they know I got white low low
Rob who, take what (gun cocks) hello
They know I give a fuck about them haters
Young jizzle been getting paper
Granite, wheels on the coup like savors
Hit da club with twenty broads like Flava
I'm on the top floor no neighbors
Who you kidding I get my 87's tailored

[Verse 4: Plies]
Went from two ounces to a Maserati
First rap check bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt the Glock 40
Get twenty-five a show next month I want forty
Born a real nigga but I die a goon
Just bought a new choppa gon use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie I can't lose
Put me anywhere I'm the realest nigga in the room
Take a look at me I'm what you call street approved
Got a lot haters but even more tools
I play dumb homie but neva been a fool
Cut my dog off I heard he snitchin too

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Lil' Wayne]
Now what I look like
And if it ain't money then I don't look right
And that don't sound right
I swear you can get a full clip not a sound bit
SU-WU gang and if you ain't with it then you in the food chain
I'm in that wide body I'm a need two lanes
Blue Seats white paint wetter than new rain
Like a white person with blue veins
I keep a black Glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly like Lu Kang
Old player new game
I'm focused I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new Wayne
How come there is two women but ain't no two Waynes
I don't know what you do but I do thangs
It's Mr. Every-Time-You-See-Me-Got-A-New-Chain
My flow crazy I ain't too sane
But I am thee shit and they just poop stain

Too many niggas running 'round here lying
Claiming my city and they ain't from mine
A-town niggas so real, so raw
My bloodline is [???] by law
My pedigree is souls on three
Souls on one, souls on four
In other words fuckboy I ain't no ho
Nigga, I'm known at the AAMCO
Where the dope gets sold and the hammers blow
Steal at the store where you grandma go
You know the same store where you can't go
Cause you ain't go, stop lying ho
Niggas see dumb niggas eyein' yo'
Piece and chain, 'bout to blow your brain
You wanna G up but you can't
Real niggas do what a fuckboy can't
Come through 'hood in wet-ass paint
Leave the car running with a filled up tank
Let a motherfucker try and touch my Chevy
Guarantee that I'ma put four in his belly
Two in his chest and a few in his neck
Then I dip back out to the flat
West-side OG that be me
Martin Luther King on my ID
Shawty Lo and T.I.P
Both know me from the goddamn streets
Now ask your favourite rapper 'bout me
No, ask your favourite d-boy about me
Ask Lil' Lean, ask Fat Steez
Ask Sleepy and Young Pill
All they gonna tell you is I keep it real
I put that shit on Adamsville

Wet me up and dush me, nigga
Up shopping in south DeKalb
South DeKalb with a [???]
Or Candler Road, Red Lobster cracking
With my east-side mobster faction
Might see me with on a Kirkwood block
With a east-side Chevy rider named Big Block
Or [Moderm] Ave. with my top on drop
Radio on Pac just gripping my cock
Gripping my Glock and gripping my grain
On [Crumington Highway - ???] getting some brain

That could of been me serving, you don't know the half my nigga
The weight I'm dealing with, I just might start killing shit
I hit the studio vibing, spitting the realest shit
I shouldve seen a psychiatrist, I was built for this
On the road of riches ain't about a bitch
No DVS's, no wink & kiss, paid dues are overdue
This shit ain't bout my neck or wrist, real shit (true story)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
It ain't all about the glitter
And the gleam it ain't what it seem (yeah)
But I'm grinding like a blender

You niggas wanna be LO but you can never be LO
Cause you can never see LO (yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Future]
Thousand dollar shots on my face, I'm coolin' it
I rock the gold, keeping it basic it ain't bout the gliss
I want the type of check I can make my niggas rich
Alot of people talk that loyalty don't know what it is
Have you ever been so broke you don't even wanna live?
So fucked up to the point that funerals can share the tears
Gotta grind so fucking hard the shit bring you to tears
Forgot to call my momma on her birthday God bless the kid
Phone barely ringing now it's ringing till it's dead
I'm bout to run dem m's up mutha fuck the feds
Got my money in a wall, ain't fucking up my bread
I had a talk with the Most High and this is what He said

[Hook][Intro: E-40]
Show them how to break they ankles, mayne
Yeah, E-40 and Shawty Lo

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Hey, let's go

[Verse 1: E-40]
This a boy, this thang slap
I brought the whole hood with me, brought the whole trap
Mama, this your song, you know the lyrics
Gonna break ya ankles, yeah, that's the spirit
Go nutty, go bananas, go berserk
Show them how to do it, let me see your foot work
We runnin' up a tab, havin' money so we spend it
Bottles everywhere, celebrating like we won the pennant
You recognize the fixture, you see the brightling watch
You get the big picture, you know that I'm a boss
(I'mma show up, I'mma show out
From the West Coast to the Dirty South)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
Fresh off tour, I brought a mil with me
Now the whole club gonna have to deal with me
Like Three 6, tear the club up
Like Pac-Man, cause I don't give a fuck
I'm throwing big bucks, cash everywhere
Shawty over here, 40 over there
You know the broads out cause the stars out
You see the parking lot, we brought the cars out
We going stupid, get retarded
And we ain't playin' with 'em, we came to party
I brought a lot of dough, I'm steadin' throwin' singles
So hit the dance floor, so gon break ya ankles

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
Do it like this, do it like that
Do it like this, then you do it like that
Break it on down, show 'em how to clown
Mean mug with it, let me see you rep your town
All street money, bonafide trapper
Never seen a check, ballin' like a rapper
80 on the arm, a hunnit on my neck
Shoe game sick, in the Bay we call it wet
More jewelry than the court room, glowin' like the moon
More jewelry than the court room, I'mma tycoon
Designer everything, throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it costs, I don't look at price tags

[Hook][Hook: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boilin water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rahstas
More ganja then reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me; Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave 10 birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop em at Moreland Plaza
Whoozy like the morning after, try me then yo skull get fractured
Ransom yo lil hansom son, so sad yo that first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter, but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another thoughta, if you serve me and you shorta
Ounce a half a eigth a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard got from my father, take no shit got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Only one dude and I'mma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay low key and get doe wit my people
Maybe try to find me some blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got love bitch, drop a few pounds
Count a few checks deal them out
Shoot a lil dice, pour a lil out
Sell an Impala make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug everything about my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day they said I wouldn’t be shit
Tell them fuck niggas "nigga look at me now!"
Mami on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don’t make no sense we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club everybody like "wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club I’m stunting on the couch
Balling like a balla me and Gucci ballin' out
Shawty got it for the low who said it was a drought?
Swag run so hard man these hoes like “Ow"
Well known in the North, raised in the South
Connected out West get them in get them out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie Glass
Stupid Brick Squad chickens in stankin' through the plastic
Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper
I’m the hottest thing walkin' around in East Atlanta
So I’m like a baby, shittin' like a damn pamper
They hatin' my swag, cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca cola where’s the water? Watch this doe I serve this order
One on the window, cause the police just might smell this odor
Barber shops and beauty parlors, just to cover dirty dollars
White girl was super dirty, so I put her in the shower

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Soo Woo! To the B Gang, it’s a G thang, see me
I’m eyeballin' shorty, Gucci got the work and Flocka got the 40
Work the wheels, and hold the gun, smoke out my pistol, I wish you’d run
Nigga win some, like which one 100-round chopper or the handgun
Heard I ain’t never lost none, I got nicks and dimes you want some
I’m a legend in the hood like Big Pun, got bales of the mid you want some, I got them
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything
I’m gudda gudda, gudda gudda, I put that shit on Gucci Mane
Brick Squad is what the fuck I claim, God y'all niggas off the chain (Loony)
Lookin' like he want my chain, I smoke him like some Mary Jane
And shorty that shit real talk
And shorty that shit real talk

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Shawty Lo]
Shawty Lo, call me Escobar
They try to retire me like the great Brett Favre
Still got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Even Nicki, fuckin' with my girlfriend
Yeah, we share that bitch
Got Waka Flocka, Gucci, Rocko in that bitch
Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist
And I’m still on the highway, takin' the risk
Back and forth, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20 with a bunch of them bricks
Ayy, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20, all white bricks

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Feds coming after us, niggas talkin bout jackin us
Married to that white girl so bitch I ain’t no bachelor
Brick Squad Re-up Gang, mothafuckin' yayo club
Lookin for another one cause I ran off on my last plug
Off white Jag, white truck, white Lambo
All white Porsche four door going ham ho
You know who I am ho (GOTTI!) You say I robbed yo brother
I don’t give a damn though; he must've had the yams low
He must've had them grams off weighing what I paid for
Too many of them bands now he laying on his man floor
I’m Yo Gotti nigga and I’m from North Memphis
In East Atlanta Zone 6 and I got the North with me

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Nicki Minaj]
I got that hard Gucc, you know these bitches easy
I got that cold flu, I got that itchy sneezy
You in that Mitsubishi, I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm takin' trips with Papi, you walkie-talkie copy
I got them pookie fiends, might rock some Juicy jeans
I mean some Juicy sweats; maybe some blue Giuseppes
I play foul; no free-throw
Bitch I ball, no free show, deadass; no peep-show
Bought our own condo, water-front condo
Daughter, son dundo; watchin' Telemundo
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
What'chu coppin'? Keep that work inside my Pippi Longstocking, bitch

[Hook]* I'm not entirely sure which guest rapper did which verse

[Intro/Hook]
Whim, wham, thank you ma'am
Ayyeah, I won't mind off the top, cut the check

Cut the check, dope boy slash rapper slash exec
Cut the check, I really lived the life
Niggas look up to me, I am the sky
Clouds... yeah I'm so fly
Screamin Bankhead 'til the day I die

[Braski]
You lookin at the trap in its flesh, rap at its best
Bankhead nigga, Front Street is next
Don't hate me, nigga hate the game
I did it for the money, you did it for the fame
Ayyyy! I'm a real go getter
Lo told me, Front Street, go get 'em
Two and a baby make me the babysitter
Got my eggbeater, now I'm fin' to go whip her
Yeah, I got crack on shiver
If the money right hell yeah I'll deliver
Deuce in the quarter, hook the wheel like Skipper
AC blowin and it feel like winter

[Hook]

[Lil Mark]
I won't stop, I cain't stop
Baby girl I need mine off top (cut the check)
God damn right, I'm with the man right?
And this what money really look like (cut the check)

This ain't a Honda, get you a two do'

Yes sir, I made moves for the peso
So they gotta cut the check when I say so

[Hook]

[Shawty Lo]
I need mine pimp, just get him on the phone

Tell them other niggas, they better leave me alone
Bankhead nigga, but I'm from Bowen Homes
Yeahhhh, what's really goin on?
Ye ain't heard of him? I'm sittin on the throne
King, ayy, that's what's goin on
Me a stuntin man? You heard it in the song

[Hook][Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
Yeah, Shawty Lo and the Big Cats

Thirty bands, fo shizzo
Eight balls same price as the kilo

Like Kells I believe I can flizzy
And yeah I'll see you later
Big ups to all my haters

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Guard your woman dawg or I'll take her
You'll hear her scream from College Park to Decatur
I was a snotty nose with no paper
Now my crib sittin on twenty-two acres
Get it right fool I gets money (yep)
If you think Ludas not filthy you's a dummy (yep)
I was allergic to the roof on the cutty
So I took the top off like a Playboy Bunny
Catch me pimpin in a robe and some slippers
Riding down 85 while I'm stunting on my Gixxer
Mouth full of swishers or riding with your sister
And six David Beckhams or a trunk full of kickers
Take a picture of the mister it'll last long
And these haters get stretched out like a bad thong
So partner mash on or get mashed up
Think you can fuck with Luda then put a million of your cash up

[Hook]
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know [x4]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm in my Cool Whip, inside's Jello

Hit da club with twenty broads like Flava

[Verse 4: Plies]
Went from two ounces to a Maserati
First rap check bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt the Glock 40
Get twenty-five a show next month I want forty
Born a real nigga but I die a goon
Just bought a new choppa gon use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie I can't lose
Put me anywhere I'm the realest nigga in the room
Take a look at me I'm what you call street approved
Got a lot haters but even more tools

Cut my dog off I heard he snitchin too

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Lil' Wayne]
Now what I look like

SU-WU gang and if you ain't with it then you in the food chain
I'm in that wide body I'm a need two lanes
Blue Seats white paint wetter than new rain
Like a white person with blue veins
I keep a black Glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly like Lu Kang
Old player new game
I'm focused I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new Wayne
How come there is two women but ain't no two Waynes
I don't know what you do but I do thangs

[Hook]

[Jim Jones]
Beside a moment we ain't livin' lavish (Oops!)
I dropped the top once and I did embarrass (My bad!)
I bought cars, brochures in a different language
I did the Porsche and my thoughts was to get the Vanquish
I love the Vee's, ladies'll love flassin'
My Air Ones, Graban jeans, and a Yachtmaster
That's a Rollie watch - the bezel was all Alaska
Big up to all my trappers!
They headed in a new ride or actin' fool by the poolside
That's how I do, hah! Belts with Louie sides
And we don't do the lines
If I don't one hole, well it must be two-sides!

Cadillac shoes and the jazzy yellow misses
Wanna blow me kisses, right around the zipper
Down and drop it to the flo’ and I ain’t even gotta tip her
R.I.P. to Jack Tripper, two up in the crib
They say they wanna have my babies then they better get a bib
Here they come

I came in as a rookie with my pockets on fat
Got a million dollar pussy, bitch, my cat got stacks
Uhh, n-n-n-now that a boss bitch move
If you go against the boss but the boss never loses
Got a house on the water so I can feed the gators
Rasberry Porsche, 32 flavors
My bread so swoll, I can’t fit it in my wallet
My pockets on big, Christopher Wallace

[Verse 6: Shawty Lo]
Do it shawty, let me say

[Verse 8: Maino]
Standin’ on the couch in club with a pocket full of c-notes
Niggas can’t tell me I ain’t bigger then Nino

Stacks on top of stacks, baby this is IHOP
