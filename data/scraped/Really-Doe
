[Produced by Kanye West; Co-Produced by Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights, lights, all of the lights

[Hook: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Hook: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flash lights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own

[Verse 3: Fergie]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

[Hook: Choir]

[Outro: Alicia Keys & Elton John]
Whoa, whoa
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
Whoa, whoa
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
Whoa, whoa
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
Whoa, whoa
I tried to tell you but all I could say[Produced by Jon Brion, Kanye West & Warryn Campbell]

[Hook: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local c'mon homey we major

[Kanye West]
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

[Hook]

[Nas]
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major! C'mon homey we major
We major! C'mon homey we major

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[Hook]

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away

[Hook]

[Kanye] + (Nas)
We major? (C'mon homey we major)
We MAJOR?! (C'mon homey we major)
We major (C'mon homey we major)
We major

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away

[Music starts to fade until 5:21 in the song]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'mma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
GOOD Music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me - why you call it Late Registration 'Ye?
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

[Outro: Tony Williams] + (Kanye West)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin good)
But better late than never; it's orien-tation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away... (We want you to get used to this)
(Uhh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Yeah...)[Intro: Consequence]
Let me hear you say (HEY) get money (HEY)
Get money (HEY) get money (HEY)
Get money (HEY) get money (HEY)
Now let's go

[Hook: Consequence]
Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first
So if you ain't bustin down, please disperse (uh)
Please disperse (uh) please disperse
I know I never should've bought that tease the purse, uhh

[Consequence]
But homie that's what happens when your {dick} in the dirt
And I guess that's what happens when your whip's in reverse
And you on the Eastside between 2nd and 1st
And you pull up on the stunt, and she dressed as a nurse
And you tell her all the things you mighta hit in a verse
And surprisin to you, man the script really works
So she gives you all her numbers plus her name and the chirp
And you made sure it's right when you hit the alert
Then you call her up tomorrow and you scoop her from work
Then you bring her round the way and the crew go berserk
Now the only question left is really who's goin first
And if you can't find a condom then you go and search
And by the time you get back shorty's way more than burnt
And she done buttoned up her blouse, and pulled up her skirt
And now you ask her what's wrong, and what went wrong?
"If you can't get her calm then you really ain't a don"
Now she yellin out "Cons, you played yourself
I wish the playa that I met woulda stayed himself"
What made me say to myself, I need to drop this chick off
'Fore the police at the door and they blockin me off
Cause you know she's testifyin like a Christian in church
So I ain't have no other choice but tell the chick disperse

[Hook] - 2X

[Gangsta L. Crisis]
Drinkin Coronas in Pamona with Mona
From the Chi so I'm cold as pneumonia
A player they warned ya, about girl I'll put it on ya
Let me mack you down in this corner
Look like the type that look good in the mornin
E'ry time we bonin you moanin
Love they way I {fuck} you have you tellin your homies
Tryin to have {shit} on lock like the police
Get mad when the other {ho} know me
Especially cause they lovin my goatee, 'fore we was +Drivin Slowly+
Went to the West, tryin to ball like Kobe
And the cold broads, was all our trophies
Kept a main girl in the show piece
Lookin at that {bitch} low-key in the Oakleys
Love the way them hips is perfect - if you ain't tryin to show me
Baby you can start dispersin, that {shit} ain't workin

[Hook] - 2X

[Really Doe]
The venue's sold out, know I'm 'bout to snap
Three rows from the front, two seats to the right
Hit her with a pass, courtesy of the man
Kick it with the stars, bring a couple of friends
Let you meet 'Ye, yeah that's the fam
Track 14, that's your favorite jam?
Damn, I'm in town for the night
Take a sip of the potion and let's get right
Into some roleplay, be wifey
No paper, no time to autograph your tee
Spotted you on stage dancin all freaky
Now you're in the back, actin shy tweakin
This ain't "Meet the Parents," what the hell you thinkin?
This ain't the church and I ain't the deacon
Damn, I'm tryin to get you out them boots
And say the first thing on my mind like Luke
Sit back, and chill with the crew
Instead you got your mind on my money and my loot
Talkin 'bout "I came back to kick it
Let's exchange digits, fly me in, I'll visit"
Cool out, you gotta be kiddin
But leave your wristbands on the table, now beat it
Worse comes to worse my peoples come first (HEY)
If you ain't bustin down (HEY) disperse (HEY)
Disperse (HEY) disperse (HEY)
Disperse (HEY) disperse (hey)

[Hook]

[Consequence]
Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first (uh)
So if you ain't bustin down, please disperse (uh)
Please disperse (uh) please disperse (uh)
Please disperse, please disperse

[Tony Williams harmonizes to the end][Hook: Jennifer Hudson](4x)
You’ve got a search magnetic power
That just keeps holding me down
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse: Really Doe]
God did his thang must have snapped his fingers twice
Definition of a life, reason why I’m like
That’s why I never hesitate to call you my wife
Support you found in Christ
Just ain’t find a church I like
I know in order to see right, I need light
Even if we fuss and fight its all good by the night
I know it’s kinda hard I live like the flight
I just want my kids kids to be aight
And this corrupt world gave me a baby girl
Make sure she need no man for them diamond and pearls
Remember worst days we used to share [?]
But we go back like plastic caps with curls
Too drunk to drive take over I gotta hurl
Raise the window down that’s the fresh to fresh air
Tripping in the truck like “That ain’t my hair!”
I want to fly to thank you just for being there cause
You (4x)

Bang. Let it bang. Yeah, let it bang. Uh uh uh yeah. Hey uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I ain't tryin' to stress my wealth
But sometimes I gotta American Express myself
When the pastor asked me why I'm flashy
Well, sometimes I gotta bless myself
I see you shining, shining like a mirror ball
Why when we're abroad we don't never hear of y'all?
You local retard, I'm the king of the world
So the king of your city by default
Niggas pullin' out cash in wads
My pants kinda tight, only fit, a credit card
But please don't get to spazzin' on 'em
Really Doe got a different type of plastic on him
And all my niggas, is big tippers
Why? A little rain never hurt no strippers
And it ain't like I can't get along with you
But I need you to get along while I get richer
Speakin' of richer you talkin' bout prior
Let's talk about now and the future which I am
All star ah, Super Bowl shuffle
Suicide door ah, big world tour ah
I am the menorah of this new era
And uh, you are?, dawg, whatever
Got to excuse the cockiness
But only an asshole can give you this much shit

[Hook: Really Doe]
Don't make me swipe my card
Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
I know you star, stuntin' for these broads
Nigga don't make me swipe my card
Peep the ice game
What the fuck? Are you a retard?
Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
Nigga don't make me swipe my card

[Verse 2: Really Doe]
It's no fair he's not
No nigga bring the thunder
Make your account look like social security numbers
I fast yesterday, now you feel my hunger
Why you grillin' the Hummer?
Can it be yours, you wonder
I'm on top and you're so far under
Dodgin piranha's swimmin' with them fish
Chicken, Salmon, yeah my favorite dish
Mess the kitchen up and I don't have to touch a dish
I suggest you disperse, take a guest list
Henny, Remy, bottles of Cris
Miss, do you know who in this bitch?
Handle that, I swung my wrist
Look my name up, find me in the Ritz
That's cause I'm stuntin' with more labels than cars on All Star Weekend
Awe baby we ballin', glasses over here are kinda low
Don't stall

[Hook: Really Doe]

[Outro: Really Doe]
Man, just so you niggas don't get it confused
I ain't talkin' about lean cards either
It's got to have one of these logos: American Express, Master, Visa[Hook] [XV]:
I'm G. double O.D
I'm G. double O.D
I'm good, good, good
I'm feeling G. double O.D
And the girls on me look good, good, good
I show up to the club and the owner show me love and say I'm good, good, good
Yep, and all around the globe, everybody bout to know that he's good, good, good

[Verse One] [XV]:
I'm G. double O.D

Cause I'm about to change minds like cold feet
In store for a meal, groceries
But they be like, "It mostly don't come over night...mostly"
Go and get your rosaries cause I'm about to kill this, no Halo like Sony
And if your girl a little horse like a pony?
Uh hmmm, well of course start pointing
Fly boy club, well course I'm soaring
So my logo gonna always be in the air like Jordan
And they always gonna stare, just ignore them
Cause now you're with the X-Man, I'm gonna call your Storm
I'm touring, say goodbye to that hood and ummm
It's foreign enough under that hood and ummm
I feel like a dude this fly, dope and cool should feel
So I guess I feel good

[Hook] [XV]:

Yep, and all around the globe, everybody bout to know that he's good, good, good

[Verse Two] [Really Doe]:
Jesus piece official and Yeezy's check
We was running shit last time I check
If I'm in the building, best believe its a check
Involved, cause we ball
She say, "My throat clear now Doe. Thanks for the Halls."
I say, "I love giving back." Baby, down for the cause
Cage us up like animals who stop at the mall
Found the spotlight at the end of the fog
They say I party too much, T.O. up in the endzone
But back when I was broke, they didn't even have a show room
Now I walk up they go, "There go Doe, mooooove."
To the sounds of C hugs and pounds
Different weight class like sumo
I'm out like UNO if you're trying to get knocked up like Juno
Unfortunately, sent you off
But you know, if Doe killing these niggas, go start the promo

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights, lights, all of the lights

[Hook: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Hook: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flash lights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know

You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe

[Verse 3: Fergie]
Unemployment line, credit card declined

And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time

Let me hear you say (HEY) get money (HEY)
Get money (HEY) get money (HEY)
Get money (HEY) get money (HEY)
Now let's go

[Hook: Consequence]
Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first
So if you ain't bustin down, please disperse (uh)
Please disperse (uh) please disperse
I know I never should've bought that tease the purse, uhh

[Consequence]
But homie that's what happens when your {dick} in the dirt
And I guess that's what happens when your whip's in reverse
And you on the Eastside between 2nd and 1st
And you pull up on the stunt, and she dressed as a nurse
And you tell her all the things you mighta hit in a verse
And surprisin to you, man the script really works
So she gives you all her numbers plus her name and the chirp
And you made sure it's right when you hit the alert
Then you call her up tomorrow and you scoop her from work
Then you bring her round the way and the crew go berserk
Now the only question left is really who's goin first
And if you can't find a condom then you go and search
And by the time you get back shorty's way more than burnt
And she done buttoned up her blouse, and pulled up her skirt
And now you ask her what's wrong, and what went wrong?
"If you can't get her calm then you really ain't a don"
Now she yellin out "Cons, you played yourself
I wish the playa that I met woulda stayed himself"
What made me say to myself, I need to drop this chick off
'Fore the police at the door and they blockin me off
Cause you know she's testifyin like a Christian in church
So I ain't have no other choice but tell the chick disperse

[Hook] - 2X

[Gangsta L. Crisis]
Drinkin Coronas in Pamona with Mona
From the Chi so I'm cold as pneumonia
A player they warned ya, about girl I'll put it on ya
Let me mack you down in this corner
Look like the type that look good in the mornin
E'ry time we bonin you moanin
Love they way I {fuck} you have you tellin your homies
Tryin to have {shit} on lock like the police
Get mad when the other {ho} know me
Especially cause they lovin my goatee, 'fore we was +Drivin Slowly+
Went to the West, tryin to ball like Kobe
And the cold broads, was all our trophies
Kept a main girl in the show piece
Lookin at that {bitch} low-key in the Oakleys
Love the way them hips is perfect - if you ain't tryin to show me
Baby you can start dispersin, that {shit} ain't workin

[Hook] - 2X

[Really Doe]
The venue's sold out, know I'm 'bout to snap
Three rows from the front, two seats to the right
Hit her with a pass, courtesy of the man
Kick it with the stars, bring a couple of friends
Let you meet 'Ye, yeah that's the fam
Track 14, that's your favorite jam?
Damn, I'm in town for the night
Take a sip of the potion and let's get right
Into some roleplay, be wifey
No paper, no time to autograph your tee
Spotted you on stage dancin all freaky
Now you're in the back, actin shy tweakin
This ain't "Meet the Parents," what the hell you thinkin?
This ain't the church and I ain't the deacon
Damn, I'm tryin to get you out them boots
And say the first thing on my mind like Luke
Sit back, and chill with the crew
Instead you got your mind on my money and my loot
Talkin 'bout "I came back to kick it
Let's exchange digits, fly me in, I'll visit"
Cool out, you gotta be kiddin
But leave your wristbands on the table, now beat it
Worse comes to worse my peoples come first (HEY)
If you ain't bustin down (HEY) disperse (HEY)
Disperse (HEY) disperse (HEY)
Disperse (HEY) disperse (hey)

[Hook]

[Consequence]
Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first (uh)

Bang. Let it bang. Yeah, let it bang. Uh uh uh yeah. Hey uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I ain't tryin' to stress my wealth
But sometimes I gotta American Express myself
When the pastor asked me why I'm flashy
Well, sometimes I gotta bless myself
I see you shining, shining like a mirror ball
Why when we're abroad we don't never hear of y'all?
You local retard, I'm the king of the world
So the king of your city by default
Niggas pullin' out cash in wads
My pants kinda tight, only fit, a credit card
But please don't get to spazzin' on 'em
Really Doe got a different type of plastic on him
And all my niggas, is big tippers
Why? A little rain never hurt no strippers
And it ain't like I can't get along with you
But I need you to get along while I get richer
Speakin' of richer you talkin' bout prior
Let's talk about now and the future which I am
All star ah, Super Bowl shuffle
Suicide door ah, big world tour ah
I am the menorah of this new era
And uh, you are?, dawg, whatever
Got to excuse the cockiness
But only an asshole can give you this much shit

[Hook: Really Doe]
Don't make me swipe my card
Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
I know you star, stuntin' for these broads
Nigga don't make me swipe my card
Peep the ice game
What the fuck? Are you a retard?
Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
Nigga don't make me swipe my card

[Verse 2: Really Doe]
It's no fair he's not
No nigga bring the thunder
Make your account look like social security numbers
I fast yesterday, now you feel my hunger
Why you grillin' the Hummer?
Can it be yours, you wonder
I'm on top and you're so far under
Dodgin piranha's swimmin' with them fish
Chicken, Salmon, yeah my favorite dish
Mess the kitchen up and I don't have to touch a dish
I suggest you disperse, take a guest list
Henny, Remy, bottles of Cris
Miss, do you know who in this bitch?
Handle that, I swung my wrist
Look my name up, find me in the Ritz
That's cause I'm stuntin' with more labels than cars on All Star Weekend
Awe baby we ballin', glasses over here are kinda low
Don't stall

[Hook: Really Doe]

[Outro: Really Doe]
Man, just so you niggas don't get it confused
I ain't talkin' about lean cards either
It's got to have one of these logos: American Express, Master, Visa[Produced by Jon Brion, Kanye West & Warryn Campbell]

[Hook: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local c'mon homey we major

[Kanye West]
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

[Hook]

[Nas]
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major! C'mon homey we major
We major! C'mon homey we major

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[Hook]

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away

[Hook]

[Kanye] + (Nas)
We major? (C'mon homey we major)
We MAJOR?! (C'mon homey we major)

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away

[Music starts to fade until 5:21 in the song]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'mma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
GOOD Music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me - why you call it Late Registration 'Ye?
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

[Outro: Tony Williams] + (Kanye West)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin good)
But better late than never; it's orien-tation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away... (We want you to get used to this)
(Uhh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)

You’ve got a search magnetic power
That just keeps holding me down
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse: Really Doe]
God did his thang must have snapped his fingers twice
Definition of a life, reason why I’m like
That’s why I never hesitate to call you my wife
Support you found in Christ
Just ain’t find a church I like
I know in order to see right, I need light
Even if we fuss and fight its all good by the night
I know it’s kinda hard I live like the flight
I just want my kids kids to be aight
And this corrupt world gave me a baby girl
Make sure she need no man for them diamond and pearls
Remember worst days we used to share [?]
But we go back like plastic caps with curls
Too drunk to drive take over I gotta hurl
Raise the window down that’s the fresh to fresh air
Tripping in the truck like “That ain’t my hair!”
I want to fly to thank you just for being there cause
You (4x)

[Hook](4x)
