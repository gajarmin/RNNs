[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the 3rd grade
I thought that I was gay
Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"
Tripping, yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math, like
"Yeah, I'm good at little league"
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, playing God
Ahh, nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm [x4]

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same but that's not important
No freedom til we're equal
Damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]
I don't know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful
Some would rather die
Than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath, it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook]

[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)[Intro]
"Hey Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?"

What what, what, what
Bada, bada, bada dada

[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags, only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up, this is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now walk into the club like "What up?! I got a big cock!"
Nah, I’m just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop.
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like “Damn, that’s a cold ass honkey”
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
(Pissssss...) But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it, ‘bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else has been walking in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I’m hella happy, that’s a bargain, bitch
I’ma take your grandpa's style, I’ma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa, "Can I have his hand-me-downs?" (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found digging
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain’t got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like “Ah, he got the Velcros”

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I’m digging, I’m digging, I’m searching right through that luggage
One man’s trash, that’s another man’s come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-
Up shirt, cause right now, I’m up in here stuntin'
I’m at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I’m not, I’m not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I’ll take those flannel zebra jammies, second hand and I’ll rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like “Oh that Gucci, that’s hella tight”
I’m like “Yo, that’s fifty dollars for a t-shirt”
Limited edition, let’s do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that’s just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt’s hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don’t
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand?
Man you hella won’t, man you hella won't

Goodwill
Poppin' tags
Yeah!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Wanz]
I wear your granddad's clothes, I look incredible
I’m in this big ass coat from that thrift shop down the road

[Hook]

"Is that your grandma's coat?"[Intro]
"Chad Butler, known as Pimp C, died in a Los Angeles hotel room..."
"The L.A. County Coroner’s office ruled the rapper's death accidental..."
"And attributed it to a combination of..."
"Apnea?"
"Yes."
"...and syrup, and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine?"
"Absolutely, we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic..."

[Verse 1]
He rolled up, asked him what he was sipping on
He said lean, you want to hit it, dawg?
That's the same stuff Weezy's sipping huh
And tons of other rappers that be spitting hard
Yup, he had five up on
When he passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter pink, heard it in a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip, sitting in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimping as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hot box, let the bass bump
Take it to the face, gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddam, he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat, just so healing
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up, cold sweat, scratching, itching
Trying to escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without getting nauseous
Room spinning
Thinking he might of sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutching that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name, shook him but he never got up

He never got up, he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us
It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us
Nah, it won't be us

[Verse 2]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
Pack being pushed, harassed by the Feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talking about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declining record sales
Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Lil Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know cause he's my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit
Pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made, feeling like a failure
And trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parent's basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And "Weed's not a drug," that's denial
Groundhog Day, life repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them
We used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheating and lying
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealing and taking anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplying
That rush, that drug, that dope
Those pills, that crumb, that roach
Thinking I would never do that, not that drug
And growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Looking in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become
Swore I was going to be someone
And growing up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood, here we come

[Outro]
You can tend to, um, go a little too far with some of these things , they have very strong addictive qualities, pills and syrups and whatnot, so um…
(Is it changing the music?)
Um, I can only speak for myself personally, you know what I'm saying? Um, we had been taking down, toning down the content of certain things in the music lately. My new album, of course, probably won't have any references to cough syrup in it, but, uh, it's a little bit more than the music. I think it's gonna start affecting the personal lives of a lot of artists and people...[Verse 1]
I was seven years old
When I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, Momma
This air bubble right here
It’s gonna make me fly
I hit that court
And when I jumped, I jumped
I swear I got so high
I touched the net, Mom I touched the net
This is the best day of my life
Air Maxes were next
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the tread
In school
I was so cool
I knew that I couldn’t crease em
My friends couldn’t afford em
Four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn’t the best
But my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos’ brother got murdered for his fours, whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn’t wanna get caught
From Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro
Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground
Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy
I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool
And I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

[Hook]
I want to fly
Can you take me far away
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I’ll go so high
I’ll go so high
My feet won’t touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

[Verse 2]
We want what we can’t have
Commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn
I just got to flaunt it
Got to show em
So exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes
I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me
I’m a cool kid
I’m an individual, yeah
But I’m part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
"Are you stupid?
Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!"
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That’s my air bubble and I’m lost, if it pops
We are what we wear
We wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change
Or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me
But I’m trying to take mine
Off

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They started out
With what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it’s just another pair of shoes[Verse 1]
I hope that God decides to talk through him
That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork, cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums
Let the snare knock the air right out of your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Amen, regardless I'mma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
About damn time that I got out of my basement
About damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours
I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell
David-Bowie-meets-Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

[Hook x2]
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'mma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him, celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage I'm actually working on leaving
See, I observed Escher
I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Haring
You see I studied art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great cause they paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No Child Left Behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system
What did you expect
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it
No light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart, no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever man
What is up with you
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat
Tears and blood when up in the booth

[Bridge]
It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted a encore but there's no encore today
Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave
Part of the show
It all fades away
Lights go to black
Band leaves the stage
You wanted an encore but there's no encore today
Cause the moment is now
Can't get it back from the grave

[Outro]
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Hook: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud in
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, there's a problem with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had her inhaling my love, tryna blow my mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving and smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all, kill the fucking whips
See what's popping at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my balls
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga, fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
Q

[Hook x2][Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now it’s gone
Let’s leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Same city, yeah, we can’t break up
Nice mask on, I wore the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment – what’s the matter?
She’s learning that she never should have dated a rapper
I don’t blame her, my mind is gone
I’m at dinner, checking phone calls, texts and blogs
I don’t hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs

Goes on and on
Don’t wanna break you, but I’m leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it’s gone

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now it’s gone
Let’s leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
It’s over, over

[Bridge: Buffalo Madonna]
Didn’t believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I’m on the homie’s couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can’t live without her
Now you’re paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain’t like you alone
Haven’t made love with the lights still on
It’s like you’re hiding something from me

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Let’s fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy of me husband and you wife
Lyin’, staring into those two eyes
And I can’t take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let’s keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love – maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to god, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and gettin' my heart thawed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed off shotgun at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with a complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I’ve been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I’m leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it’s so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

[Bridge: Macklemore & Buffalo Madonna]
Can’t get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

Can’t get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna][Intro]
How y'all doin there folks?
My name is Aberdeen Washington
And I'm a proud American
And a terrorist fighter
That's right
Hey gimme another beer bitch!

[Hook]
Now when the day Bin Laden comes to town

Mow my lawn, sit on the couch
Imma watch some football
I pray to the Lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell outta them damn Redskins
Call up the boys
Get drunk as shit
God damn right I'm an American

[Verse 1]
That's right
I'm American
Got a picture of Reagan above my fire
Next to the deer I shot with my rifle
NRA hell yeah I support 'em
No pro choice
No abortion
Mexicans, send 'em back over the border
Ride on home to Samoa
Or wherever they come from
They're takin' our jobs
Eatin' our hamburgers
Takin' our jobs
They takin' our jobs!
I see them in the field
I'm takin' their head off
I hate my job
And I hate my boss
But I love my country

[Bridge]
And I pray to God
That the Cowboys win
Fuck yeah Romo!
And the Cowboys win
That's right, that's right, that's right
C'mon, everybody
Just clap your hands
If you love our country
If you love our land
That's right
And if you're not clapping your hands
You're a terrorist
And you eat sand (sandwiches)

[Hook]
The day Bin Laden comes to town
I'mma drop a deuce
Wipe my poop with his towel
Mow my lawn
Sit on the couch
And I'mma watch some football
And I pray to the lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell outta them damn Redskins
Call up the boys
Get drunk as shit
God damn right I'm American

[Verse 2]
I'm Ameri-fuckin-can
And John McCain and Sarah Palin
I know you lost out there
It was a tough one
But you're still two mavericks in my book
Don't worry about it
And listen Palin
I heard you like beer, me too
I don't have a 6 pack
But I got a beer bong in my pants
What do ya' say we go get shit faced
In a helicopter and kill a moose
America, the chosen, guns, explosions, McDonald's, bowling
You don't like it? We exploit you!
Pop a pill, get a boner!
Hell yeah
Tony Romo
Man that guy is so damn cute
I wanna sack his boner
And ride him broke back
All the way to Wyoming
No homo, psych!
Hey I said no homo
Fuck terrorists!
I mean like, I don't wanna fuck a terrorist
Guys I'm kidding!
I like Romo
I don't "like" Romo
I said fuck terrorists
Not I wanna fuck a terrorist
You wouldn't, if you caught Bin Laden
You wouldn't give him one in the butt?
For America?
If you said "no homo" right after you did it?
It doesn't count if it's terrorists

[Bridge]
Hey little Aberdeen
Come in here
Yeah?
Hey come sing the national family anthem
Come on
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Hey hey!
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Hey hey!

[Outro]
That's right
I'm an American citizen
Aberdeen Washington
This is my country
And just because Barack Obama
Won the presidential election
Does not mean that half the country
Doesn't feel the same way I do
Man I came to America (yeah)
And I live in America (c'mon)
And I live in America
I do too dad
Lemme get em
And I live in America
Dad and I live in America
Shut up!
Little Aberdeen shut the fuck up!
My bad
Lemme tell 'em
That's right
I'm AmericanAnd we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
Our lives (our lives)
Our lives (our lives)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tonight (tonight!)
Tonight (tonight!)
Tonight!
Cause tonight's the night
Am I right?
Dance

Feels like the night for a party
My nature's so naughty
There's a knock on the door
It's the neighbors
Quit cock-blocking
We're having a ho-down, you hoes down?
Don't make me pull my hose out
Cause it's big, long, pink, strong
And been known to dance, like, all night long
Grab my hand, play this song
DJ, save my life, come on!
Leave your fear, back off the wall
Free of beat and pussy pop
And if you don't have a pussy
Pop a cock into a booty
Into a booty

And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

I am not, I am not going to stand on the wall
I will dance, I will dance, I will break that ass off
And I see you in the corner, corner looking so small
Doing the robot like, "If I die tonight, at least I went hard"
I will not, I will not give a damn who watches me
I will live, I will live! Liberate the fox in me
I will be the discoball
Freakin' give my all
To whatever girl's booty
I'm freaking on
I'm not skeeting, nah
It's just freaking hot

"...alright, I skeeted."

I will not be a mannequin
The ego banished
The roof's on fire
Let's burn down the Vatican
I will moon walk to Pluto in honor of Michael Jackson
In heaven he'll be saying that man is tight at dancing
Rip to the king, Michael Jackson, we learned it all from you
Dedicate this to the dance floor
Party up the sorrow 'til tomorrow morning happens
We pledge allegiance to the DJ
Put your hands up

And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
Our lives

You see me looking at you from that bar right over there
But your friends are huddled up and they are hating on a player
I just want to dance with you
Get on the back of you
Tip tap the boots
Extract the truth
Da-Dance with you
Get on the back of you
Da-Dance dance dance
"Awesome!"

Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
(Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh)

Hey-oh, hey-oh
(Hey-oh, hey-oh)

Uh-ah-ba-bo
(Uh-ah-ba-bo)

Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop
(Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop)

And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives[Verse 1: Fences]
My old man
He kicked me out
He kicked me out
When I told him that I lived this way
I lived this way, I lived this way
I lived this way, I lived this way
I lived this way, I lived this way
He doesn't own me
He doesn't own me
He doesn't own me
Just escape!

[Hook: Fences]
Arrows were falling (x4)

[Verse 2: Fences]
The black rinse align your face
Like a deer drinking water in a picture frame
I swear to God I've seen those eyes
The back of my lids when closing mine
With clasped hands we shake it out
We shake it out
Lace the boots and we walk away
I felt slightly connected to him
And said now boy, now you own me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Yeah, yeah
He doesn't sleep
So in truth he never wakes up
Another day rushing to his death
Out of breath on the treadmill of the famous
He makes mistakes tells stories to his paintbrush
And when the world finally sees his art
He wishes that he never would have made it
Just escape, just escape ricochets
And eclipses faith living in a city
With a grey umbrella over your shoulders
And you're becoming suffocated by the weight
Can't hit those breaks
This is what you wanted, huh
But you got it all in vein cause you forgot who you are
Right as the world learned your name it goes...

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Let me ash my issues
Ashtray in this asphalt
American spirits
Black coffee, conversations and a passport
When God gives you everything, everything
That you ever asked for and it still looks a bit different
Then when you pictured it on that back porch
And I'm gone world traveller all I got is my songs
When the nights start blending into one another and I don't recall Tom Petty in this motherfucker
All I wanna do is free fall
Yeah free fall
And I'm so caught up
I'm caught up, I'm caught up
And I'm so tired, swore that I wouldn't
Stare into the light
And guess who tried it
Shit I'm blinded by this lime light
This lime light, it's all night, it's all day
These bright lights, these bright lights
Once you turn 'em on
You can't walk away, don't die here
Don't die here
I came too far, I'm too great
But I'm too scared and I'm too afraid
To stare this world into its face
I'm almost home, I'm driving lost
My eyelids closed, light turns to grey
The cameras off, the show is over
You close the curtains and just escape

[Hook]

[Outro: Fences]
I live this way (x8)[Intro]
"To really to be a creator, you must ask yourself, 'In the stillest moment of your night, if it were truly denied you to create, would you die?' And if your answer is yes, you have no choice: that is your choice, because there is no euphoria in a different place for an artist. That's where you are; that's what you do. That's it and it's not an easy life, but it's your life."

[Hook]
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways
Because the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways

[Verse 1: Xperience]
Instead of staying the same
Because I see better days ahead of me
I paint them on the page
Then I save them for the rainy ones
When anger and the anguish want to hang around
I say em outloud and complain to them
I figure I'm made to live and haven't gone that far
But I made it here so if there is a God I give thanks to him
Then I take a pen and make amends again
The only way I know to repent
I know somebody listenin

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Dear God I'm so thankful for you keeping my plate full
The struggles, heartache, pain, the progress and the breakthrough
Every single track has made who I am to this day
Prove this page is the only way to paint you
But lately it's like my soul feels counterfeit
Scared to pick up the pen to see what the hell might come out of it
So God grant me the serenity without giving me the christening
Because all I ever needed was a beat and people listening
Step Cousins

[Hook]
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways
Because the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways

[Verse 3: Xperience]
Instead of rotting away and plotting my grave, hiding in a bottomless shame
I found a way to fight my way out and see the light of day
And proud to say I took the safe route but there's a price to pay
They like to keep my name in they mouth and tell lies on me
What you see is what you get, truth in the flesh, homie
You can do the rest I'm through with trying to prove myself to you
I'll see you when you wake up, hope the feeling is mutual

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Now for artists and musicians you see the target's to list
To the heart inscripts with no margins, no limits
To make to pain, strengths, sun rays a part of the picture
And can bathe in every shade and take it further and vivid
They're going to say what they say, abrasion, the vision
And whatever the DJ plays, they mark, and they gimick
But I've got a path to follow and along with the distance I realize I'm already awake
I'm just starting to live it
My language

[Hook]
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways
Because the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways[Sample: Macklemore]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids

[Verse 1]
All we really want, each and every one of us is to be remembered in a million years
That’s why I live my life the best I can with no regrets and try to ignore all of these fears
Why is it when girls hook up they’re called sluts…but guys get hi fives for bustin their nuts
Should I rap more like this, should I rap more like that?
I should just rap as myself as a matter of fact
And that’s the reason I think Scotty’s wack
Cause he doesn’t seem to have depth on his tracks
And depth is all I seem to have left, cause so many sleepless nights all I’ve done is wept
And throw on some Eminem and pretend that I don’t wish my life would end
And my friends aren’t there so why do I even call them friends

But in reality and honesty, I’m probably a wannabe of possibly a prophecy cause constantly im commonly
…the one trying to live modestly when nobody else does
Most of the time I feel I’m the kid nobody else loves
And they say “oh Frankie wow I love him”
In my head I say “when was the last time you hugged him”
Cause that’s all I need to keep from breaking
But it gives me something to write, music making
Cause Kobe made 23 million in 2010
Where as we got parents who won't see their kids again
And yet as the same time that America sheds a tear
Ray rice is getting 9 mill a year
Cause he plays for the Baltimore ravens
Yet we still have “Food for the homeless foundations”
Education isn’t getting any funding
Yet we’re surprised when our kids turn out like al bundy

[Sample: Macklemore]
The fact of it is most people that rap like this talkin' about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declined record sales
Follow the formula violence, drugs, and, sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pavement

[Verse 2]
And that’s why I tell stories within all of my rhymes
Cause there’s parts of me within all of these lines
And I can bear my soul in each and every rap poem
The depth of who I am I’m trying to show them
There’s more to me than a half black kid who giggles
I speak through rhymes which speak through riddles
And to the haters I give these fingers in the middle
The concept of what I try to say is so simple
But in reality nobody really gives a fuck
They want something to roll their windows down and turn their system up
Well screw it I’m saying I’ll rap how I wanna
And be myself is what I am gonna
..Do and its nothing new or fresh
I’d rather be hated for what I am then fake and the best
The life I’m fearing… seems more like the life I’m nearing
And they say to face your fears but they shouldn’t be approaching…
How did I I get stuck in this spot, where music is all I got
And it’s a lot but it’s never enough
And when it comes down to it I’m trying to rap real stuff
Like the fact that the only that’s going up is the debt
And the amount of nationwide tragedies and death
And the kids under the influence of herion and meth
Because a home life is something they never met

[Sample: Macklemore]
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And "weeds not a drug" - that's denial
Groundhog Day life repeat each time
Cheatin' and lyin'
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealin' and takin' anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere

[Verse 3]
I come from a city where people have it so good
That to add excitement to their life they try to act hood
Being rude to cops and taking so many shots
That they are seeing spots by the time it’s 12 o’clock
And then they are drinking and driving
Barley surviving but the thing that is oh so surprising
Is that they’re doing well in school
Silly little fools, I know you’re drinking just to seem cool
And then the ones who are privledged are breaking all the rules
Yet still have the money to apply to 5 star schools
Did you know out of my graduating class
3 of the valedictorians had been caught straight passed
Out on the couch from drinking
And the thing that I am thinking
Is that America is great I really truly love her
But I’m thinking she isn’t really a mother
More like a little sister or brother
That takes everything they do wrong and cover
It up, to the best of their luck
Cover up anything that happened when they run amuck, That’s what’s up
You’d rather here a dope beat and some lines about sex
Well listen to the other 900 rappers who claim that they’re next

[Sample: Macklemore]
Thinkin' I would never do that, not that drug
And growing up nobody ever does
Until your stuck, lookin' in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become
Swore I was goin' to be someone
And growing up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood here we come*Door Bell Rings*

[Verse 1]
I walked in with a pimp strut
… “What up?”
Door man’s like, “You on the list?”
I’m like, “Shiiii…
I should be there… like after the L’s”
He said it’s too early to tell
“Fuck it, go ahead.”
Afrika Bambaataa
Kool Herc was looping the break beat
Rocksteady was breakin’
That’s what’s up
Gave Scott La Rock dap
Proceeded up to the bar one Taki 183 and flat black was tight on the wall
Eddie Pint was with Dante
And went to bomb broadway
Sugarhill, Run-D.M.C. were kickin' raps
Busta and the Beasties came in, drinking brass monkeys
Bumrushed the show, hopped on stage then
A whole bunch of white dudes opened the door and came in
After Ed Lover, Dr. Dre then Big Daddy Kane
Said there ain't no half steppin', walk this way
Went to the next room had the 90's on it, "hell yeah"
Ayo it smell like chronic
Hella juice & gin
I grab my cup, try to fill it to the brim
Somebody said "Ayo, you ain't chipped in? I'm playing nephew, go ahead"
Ice Cube was choppin' it up
With MC Ren and Quik was playing the cuts
I saw Eazy, Spice 1, and King Tee
Bloods and Crips talkin shit and straight schemin’
Olde English, Starter caps, and gold daytons
Gold-plated, hearing Bones, Jheri curl activator
And the party started crackin
And this dude in the background who looked familiar started dancing...
But I don't know he seemed dope
The whole party was like he hadn't rapped in the east coast

[Hook]
Lyrical, physical, very artistical
Give the party people something funky to listen to
Step up if you wanna get hurt
Step, Step up if you wanna get hurt
All you MC's are some riders
All you need is a line
Til' you change and rearrange
And then what happened this time
I checkmate, terminate, never late, contemplate
Mind state is never fake, hesitate you lose

[Verse 2]
There was this group in the cypher called Das FX
And a Tribe Called Quest
Q-Tip was searchin' for his wallet sayin' somebody got him
10 dollars sayin' it was someone from Compton
LL was on the side of the kangol, talkin' about his Momma
Sayin' that if anyone stepped
They’d get knocked out. He promised
Watching Butter-Pecan Ricans licking their ice cream
Ghostface did lines, and Bees that were lime green
??????, liquorice and a dutch
I hit that shit once and then passed out off the blunt
I woke up in struggle for breath by Nas
He said sleep was the cousin of death, my God
Door busted down and I thought it was the cops
It was 2Pac saying that he had just gotten shot
Stood up out the wheel chair said “fuck this city.”
Grabbed a Cristal bottle, pointed it at Biggie
Puff jumped up was like “take that, one”
The whole party stopped and said…
2Pac left the party with Suge in the ‘lac
Nobody ever thought that ‘Pac would never come back
An hour later Big and Puff left
Big said he was ready to die, but there’d be life after his death
Craziest shit I’ve ever been to, the wildest venue
But it wasn't over yet, the party must continue...
Yeah, Yeah I said continue
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Hook 2]
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
Crucial, lyrical style ain't what it used to
Microphone check one two (echo)

For some, this is where the party began
Some say it’s where the party was crashed
There was a new room, a new dude named Shady in the Aftermath
"Hi, my name is, what..." it was that everybody started to want to rap
Rock fans from the other parties put down their guitar straps
And started writing their bars on a pad
The ‘burbs were already in the building
And the media been feeling if another party was on smash
Pepsi endorsements, Spike, Coca-cola
Was tellin' the whole world where the party was at
The line to get in, it wasn't just around the building
It was around New Zealand and the underground was making chat
Saying it was wack; remember the art the heart, they taking it back
But it was too late for that, they started making, scratch the line
Complaining about the game, was saying it’s wack
Hold up, half the people that were dissing it
Were half the reason that the party was so big
And everyone in line was out there trying to get respect
And then the party got put on the internet
Shit
They bum-rushed the door
You couldn't move anymore
There wasn't room on the floor
And out came the neighbors
Getting on TV and complaining about the noise
Bill O’Reilly and Oprah came down and they started hating
The venue wasn't making money cause no one was paying
Unless you had Lil’ Wayne or T-Pain in the room
Nas came down and said the party was dead
Somebody lit a match all you heard was a
*BOOM*[Intro: Evan Roman]
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
They say thirty is the new twenty
And twenty is the new thirty shit I guess
Makes sense, cause fifteen year olds seem twenty
And twenty five year olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basehead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, who's got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
If cynical hispters with long hair
And cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

[Hook: Evan Roman]
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
They say, "It's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth"
The guns that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less conscious
Than rappers rapping 'bout them strippers up on a pole, popping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that "It’s poetry, you’re so well spoken," stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there's a new Rodney on Youtube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet "R.I.P Trayvon Martin"
Don't wanna be that white dude million-man marching
Fighting for a freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
"But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talking race, trying to save the fucking globe?"
Don't get involved if the cause isn't mine
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's 1999
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

[Hook + Outro][Macklemore]
Check it, now let’s get creative, mama, I made it
Been dope since Baby was kissing Wayne on Rap City: The Basement
No diss to Wayne, he’s my favorite, so stupid, write with these cadences
Looser with music like Lucifer using ultimatums
The greatest thrift shopper in the rap game, watch me
The don gotta abuse closed honkies, I’m buying sweat pants at the swap meet
Going to 106 & Park and kicking it with Rocsi
Studio’s a pita roll whenever I’m recording
I’mma be like Terrence, yo, let me borrow some Jordans
Let me wear ‘em for the weekend, if I crease ‘em where the toe is
I’m blaming Drake and Chris Brown like my bad, I’m out
Now roll in the bucket, going a hundred and bumping my own club hit
And that seven’s hitting like bumping school teachers back in the 80’s
We laid up, creating something, we make art from the heart
You can feel that in your gut and this is awesome
This coat I’m rocking, Hungarian tiger, nah, I’m lying
It’s probably just a possum, tell PETA to get the hell up off it
Man, I'm from Seattle where we show the world how to mosh pit, I’m spazzing
Ah, I messed up, looks like I’m playing these haters on the internet
Get all pumped in the comment section like no, I’m not a rapper that sucks
No, I’m just being me, something you never been good at once
Nah, listen, I’m sick, no factitious intent, I could rap better than rappers
In a fake British accent, I’m with Adele and we’re dry humping
Making out by a fence with a beautiful, big bone red head with breasts ah
Shout out to RCA, Geffen and Atlantic, Interscope, Universal
Every major left on the planet, the (producs?) gave us props
Like we’re daps and handshakes, trying to make money
Off the strength of our fan base and take a third of our merch
All that money you’re getting is reimbursed, now let’s do the math for a second
No, not now, never unless you’re giving us what we’re worth
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yeah right, this is my life, that’s like being in the cypher
And passing up on the mic, right? America, get prepared for October ninth
World Tour and our album, The Heist, BET, I’m gone[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemans
This an ode to the B-boys, B-girls
The people out there who do it for the love
And believe me I'm not dissin' anybody out there who's trying to get paid
I'm trying to get paid too!
But I got one question

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Whatever happened to the heart?
That pumped the passion into the art?
The entity that gave you the energy to wanna start?
Breakdancing, I'm battling, doing it at the park
Where the mission was expression, not only to top charts
I don't know what happened, wanting to blow rap
You lose soul and passion for the flows and the tracks
Radio's lacking, controlled by fascists, assholes doing damage
But we're gonna take it back
Before beats to a hundred G's a pop
All you needed was a tabletop and a beatbox
Hip-hop without the B-boy is like shelltoes only having two stripes
Hip-hop, we're freedom-fighting, graffiti-writing, party types
That recite and organize and revitalize our rhyming
'Til the group of the moneymakers systems
Knows that the industry can eventually get served
Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolution throughout our words
If you really want it, come on get it, cause I've got it
I'm honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers of this culture that are giving them props and learn
If you wanna earn your stripes
You gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike
The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
Will never be documented in the Coke commercial

[Hook]
We be the baddest

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now B-boys, B-girls
Bring it back to the block
Lemme see you get ill, for real, pop and lock!
If you record without thought then stop
Because I'll serve your whole album with the goddamn beatbox
Without thought it just happens
If you gotta think to feel, that's not rapping, that's acting
I'm from a land of backpacks and fat cats
MCs with sick raps who serve those that are wack
It's a way of life
I put all my energy into the melody
On the mp3s until the death of me
Record exceptionally, especially
Whenever I be monumentally, grammatically, killing the mic
I tell my DJs, cranking that music, keeping 'em moving when the beat plays
Staying into it, breaking and grooving, and MCs they
Thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make
Taking from lucid to really do it
All the people gotta make their money
And the way to make money is to get inside of the industry
Take it on the radio, flow
So you can go blow, we get a car
And a crib up on MTV
But in the end what's classic?
Radio bubblegum? or a voice filled with passion?
To my real hip-hop heads, please stand up
Cause the only people that can preserve this art is us[Verse 1: Wale]
All these bitches drunk as shit, all my niggas high as shit
I'm just trying to find a chick that's flier than my prior bitch
Higher than Mariah in a choir full of violins
And louder than a microphone that's slightly near a lion's den
Pass me that bong, inhale, astronaut flow, space jam
Gas 'em like a rental, when I take off, tell the bitch take care
Tree those niggas, I'm a G to them cause the OGs here
And I believe in them, a couple lames out there had beef with them
But everybody is a G with the weed in them

[Hook: Tony Williams]
How I want you to see how these things are looking to me
I hope you don't see nothing wrong and darling
I don't want you to feel what your eyes don't want me to hear
But now that we're free, let's be gone, you got me blazing high

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
She don't know me, she don't care, she just want a man that'll be right there
To get it in, any minute, I'll be hit with a stare
And when I'm done with her, ain't no other male to compare
I'm living by simple rules, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you
See, the luxury that we accustomed to, I take a smut to eat
Cause she don't touch her food cause she model bad
Meet me in the tele where the lobby at, I'm probably there
If not, I probably left the key with the concierge
And got her room number, you can find me there
Then switch cars like a valet, keeping hoes on they toes like a ballet
Yeah, she right but she do a little wrong, Black Swan when it's on but I can't stay

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
I'm like let's roll, let's roll, she's like let's go, let's go
Had sex, watched Parks and Rec in the morning, I make you some Eggos
I saw her like oh my god damn, look you're the shit huh?
Project Runway good at the mall but can still find deals at the thrift shop
From the hotel, to the bedroom, to the Volvo, we're going too long
Four Seasons, to the motel, to the floor, headed back up to the futon
I fell in lust with the curves, she fell in love with the burst
The only way it worked is cause she loved herself first, let's go

[Hook][Intro]
Hello Americans
My name is George Bush, and I'm going to do a rap for ya'll
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm from Texas
We're homophobic and sexist
And if these Mexicans keep coming in I'm 'a dismember 'em
You don't see me in El Paso, selling their tacos
Shit in my el baño, I'll cut off your asshole
Goddamn it, don't even talk about the faggots
If I ever seen one singing the national anthem I'ma strangle 'em
Hell nah, they can't get married, but they can fight in the military
Hopefully they'll end up buried in a cemetery
I don't even consider 'em people
Go ahead put 'em in the front lines
Next to the Negroes
But I'm not racist
Colin Powell's like my brother, alright I admit it I hate him
Where's Dick Cheney at? Probably off in Iraq
Finding some oil to tap, tell 'em I got up on that
And y'all still think it was Bin Laden
When it was us and the Masons, plotting on oil profits

[Hook x2]
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich

[Verse 2]
My brother said some racist shit a couple of years back
Then the blacks came out and started to protest and crap
And I knew I'd have little hope, cause all of sudden
The blacks got together and started to register to vote
But thank God for computers and them helping
Cause we got the last names of every single felon
We programmed the computers to find the names that were the same
Whoever came up couldn't vote on election day
Way to go Jeb, really great strategy
We got rid of the majority of black families
And I'm not even talking about Dade County
The expired military ballots are bogus, counted
I'd like to thank my cousin and the help from my pappy
My cousin owns Fox and it made me very happy
He told the entire world that I won
Before the votes were being done counted
And even though Gore had more, what matters in the end
Is the Supreme Court, and those are my dad's friends
So thank you very much, and please remember
If you don't vote, I'll see you back in November

[Hook x2]Can't Hold Us"

[Intro:]
Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you, come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Alright, alright
OK, uh, alright, OK
Alright, OK

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me
Get up! Fresh out, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y’all can’t copy
Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I’m on...
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushing

Labels out here
Now they can’t tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country
Labels out here
Now they can’t tell me nothing
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight 'til it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight 'til it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y’all can’t stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I’m eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer. Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people. Nah sing this song and it goes like
"Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching"
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure gain humility then we keep marching ourselves

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight 'til it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight 'til it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up

Wa oh oh oh wa oh oh oh wa oh oh
Let's go!

Na na na na na na na na (aha)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (that's right, feels good)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (it's alright)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
Mack-le-le-le-le-le-more...

[Album version ending:]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight 'til it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight 'til it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

[Music video ending 2x:]
Let the night come, before the fight's won
Some might run against the test
But those that triumph, embrace the fight cause
Their fears then prove that courage exists

Hope [echo][Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Verse 1]
This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Pistons
Like Dennis Rodman, I got a rod man (awww yeah!)
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
And a pink palm pink schlong, let's all dance!
From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was at Bonnaroo beating up on a bongo
I got a bottle of Martinelli's and I'm dumping
All over anybody that's kicking it in the grotto
Neighbors keep tripping, I'm like, "I'm in a castle
Fuck your condo!"

[Bridge]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You like to party, I am a party-er
You like to wander, I am a wanderer
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?
I'm the lion, the witch in the wardrobe
Massage my lap, I have a sore bone
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With both toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not
I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hookah, now make it drop
Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendon to get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom
Make it wobble, wobbly-wobble 'till my third leg has to hobble
You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty

[Hook]

[Interlude]
This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Eh, motherfuckin' eh

[Bridge 2]
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
In the night, in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Someone kill a coyote, I'm starving
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Grab your bagpipe, I grab my flute
Cause drunk King John is still in the loo
Get onto the pole in a birthday suit, our suit
And M.J. was King, and Prince was Prince
And Raven has ruled ever since

[Hook][Jim Valvano speech at the 1993 ESPY Awards]
"Time, time is very precious to me. I don't know how much I have left and I have some things I would like to say. Hopefully at the end I'll have something that will be important to other people too."

[Geologic]
Stand up, sit down, stand up again
Morse Code sent to God, are you listening?
He must have been too busy fixing other shit
No call, no response shows the opposite
We confess to the man who was faceless
I still do the same but to thousands of strangers
Went through some changes, some said I'm faithless
Cause I replaced the altar with a basement
I often fought the explanation of where people go when their bodies let go of the soul
Does it just turn cold?
Or do we get judged and told where to go?
And if so, how the fuck would you know if nobody came back and said I'm telling you, bro?
I could never get past the shit that was spit out the pastor's lips
And the rapper's started making more sense
I guess that's the reason that some people cringe when they kids get a hold of my shit
If the grip of a God is insistent on not questioning if he truly exists
No wonder that I got caught up in the music it filled my spirit to the brim, amen
Motha' fucker

[Macklemore]
This is my offering card
The only thing I have to offer is bars
The only time I felt like I was talking to God
Was in my Walkman walking with Nas
Alright see I be going to Sunday school every week
In the back trying to read, but see that something was off
Maybe it was cause I was trying to huddle in the yard
Preacher didn't connect when he would mumble the Psalms
I was in my head and I was bustin' with Pac
Takin' off my wifebeater and getting drunk in the park
After that part, I found God, it wasn't Jesus
Some psilocybin and the ink it released
I began to hold communion every time my music came out the speakers I used it
And it fuled my movement I believed in, voice of reason, just me and my Adidas
And I could achieve it, I put my hand over my heart, pledge allegiance
I solemnly swear by the faith that raised my since Kool Herc dropped that needle
The South Bronx, that's hip-hop's Egypt
The word of our God is manipulated and twisted by the same system
That is infiltrated and falsely interpreted Jesus
One life, one love, one God, It's us, treat your neighbor how you would want to be treated
The universal laws of God, don't look too far it's right here, us human beings
The spirits right here and I don't have to see it
Now every time I want to connect with God I put my headphones on
Then I nod, grab my pen, my pad, let it seep in, in
And that's my process
And God's always watching
Got God in my Walkman
Go ahead and top that[Verse 1:]
Now everyday that I walk outta my building
I see homeless people sleeping and chillin' on the steps to the apartment that I live in
Im not saying everyone is a victim, but the people that I live would treat em more like villains then actual citizens
I walk past a man laying in his own vomit, who gets his food and his garments by digging in the garbage
I beg your pardon. Mr president but I'm a resident and since you've been in office I haven't seen any evidence of things changin'
We go into our Iraq and attack
When got people on the streets without a roof over their backs
We've come to accept the homeless as part of our landscape
The money the government wastes could provide them with a safe place
To eat and sleep, but we cease to see that our own country is based around war, power and greed
We got families on the street with no where to go, and the concrete's the only place they have to call home

[Hook x2]
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling you're all alone

[Verse 2:]
Now every face tells a different story, a different message
Now how can we judge the book when we don't know the beginning
We don't know what turned 'em to the bottle, or started injectin'
We just see dirty clothes and another bum beggin'
Whatta bout the kid who was an addict the second that his mom was pregnant
Or the young girl who was raped and stripped up, everything sacred
Who now stands downtown walkin' on the block pacin' cause the only way she knows how to make it, is gettin' naked
We don't want to face it
And it being the fact that the government created the ghetto and gave it crack
To oppress immigrants and blacks, and give 'em more of a set back
Like the last 500 years wasn't enough to accomplish that
Now look at the homeless rate, and tell me to my face the race
Doesn't play an intricate part in your fate in the United States
Now think about your home, and the place that you sleep
And the homeless, who only have the concrete

[Hook x2]

Now if you wanna see change?
Then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that we're living in is not fair?
You wanna see change?
Then put your ones in the air
Now point it to the ground, cause change starts right there
You wanna see change?
Then put your ones in the air
You think the system that we're living in is not fair?
You wanna see change?
Then put your ones in the air
Now point 'em to yourself, cause change starts right there
Cause change starts right there

[Outro:]
Streets are cold, all alone, in the city
Where you lay your head is your home, what a pity
People pass you by with a glance say you're filthy
But they don't know they pain you've been through, no not really[Intro]
Life moves pretty fast
You don't stop and look around once in a while you could miss it

[Verse 1: Ka.lil (aka Khingz) of Abyssinian Creole]
Look, I've been away from my city, the city's changes ain't pretty
Babies still playing in ditchy forgotten corners
The city's forgotten its warriors
Who died young
Eyes hating the sun that's shining before us
How rotten bodies fertilizing the forest of concrete and glass
Foul hearted police aiming their gats
My head hang over beats
I hope my ghosts stay in the past
And days I couldn't play to the pad
We the same kids they'd be sending to invade Iraq
And "make it safe" with crack
I got that Gray Goose and OJ in a glass
The last day before my cousin hit the pen
Down to swing
I came back to the town just to be down with the king
And loving surroundings it seems
Just then he find out his baby cousin fell off a balcony
Images of a violent paradise is drowning me
Lost souls and I can't let go or tell no
The same scenario that rules South Othello
Black, Browns and yellow
Southsiders tell the devil "hello"
And heaven "bye"
And it hurts too much to ask why

[Hook: Abyssinian Creole]
From the places with plenty
To the space with no pity
The forces changing our city
One day at a time
If I don't change what's been given
What can I say to my children
Who gonna be claiming this city
One day...

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I grew up on Capitol Hill
With two parents and two cars
They had a beautiful marriage
We even had a swing set in our yard
My mom didn't have a job, because my dad made enough
Money that we could live comfortably and he could support us
Now, he'd commute to Tacoma, so we knew we'd be good
But then I realized everybody looked just like me in my neighborhood
I'd go to school, which was diverse
But indeed us, I got sandwiches and Capri-Sun's
And my friends ate the free lunch
It's crazy trying to look back, cause when I was growing up
I didn't understand the fact was
There's something called a social status
And my black friends weren't in my financial bracket
And then my city's divided
From neighborhood to neighborhood
We're polarized but we claim that we're progressive
The police shoot in the hood but never once in my residence
Has a white person been shot or even stopped in a Lexus?
And to think that we claim that so much has changed
Since Brown versus the Board of Education and Roe versus Wade
But around my way it all stays the same
They just figured out a way to separate the black and white face

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Gabriel Teodros of Abyssinian Creole]
Say it's the richest city in the world, right?
Images of Tent City in the shadows of Amazon's office site
In the jungle down the slide in Jose Rizal's park
There's this part in the gate, with a trail to a place over I-5
Where families survive, most my early life we've known about it
Called development? They kicked them folks out
And moved them around every chance they can since
So scared of homelessness, but ignoring them ain't gonna change it
And tearing down the 'jects ain't gonna make your ass safer
For all that paper wasted just to build up Safeco
While Garfield High School still remains like a slave boat
We gave up on hope, a long time ago, so
I wake on this floor, after pacing hours before
Mind racing like a child torn in war zones
With every side challenged
Needing to manage and understand this balance
I can't fall or falter
Brother, I'm just an author
And no amount of words offered has ever been enough to alter this system
Swallowing souls broke
My own folks roam upcoast
Holding dreams close of what America was supposed to be
But works for the rich only
This Southend in reality
Took my family back to what they was running from before
When they left that war
Same shit, different continent
Home don't exist anymore
Home don't exist anymore
The 206 that raised me just ain't the same, yo

[Sample]
All those moments will be lost, in time
Like tears in rain[Introduction]
Close your eyes
You will see

[Verse 1: Grieves]
Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
I feel weathered, but feel like I've been driving forever
Showin' up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
I've been better, but all things pass
This life is taking everything away but you're provided with your past
So fuck it--I stick to having dreams on the road
But until this dream is done I'm gonna keep my eyes closed
And breathe, breathe when it snows
Breathe when I'm forced to live a life with a person on a phone
Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin'
Leave with the seasons
Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
Cause after the show when the last star shines
I can make this all better when I close my eyes

[Verse 2: Deacon The Villain]
I'm in another zone where troubles gone
Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
A place where life is easy for everybody else
I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
But we don't know it where we don't show it all
For life ain't protocol, under sky, over law

[Verse 3: Natti]
I'm in another space where all the food is good
And there's enough for everybody in my neighborhood
Where all the grass is blue, where we don't know 'bout green
Cause money ain't a thing I pinch myself it's not a dream
Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldn't mean a thing

[Hook]
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
You will see

[Verse 4: Geologic]
Between climbing and finding it not worth it
Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
I'm so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
I think of home when I close my eyes
So done with the smokes and fries
Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
Drinks I shouldn't drink, things I never write
Cities I never liked now it's like aight
Got merch table weirdos, bros who want to cypher
Girls who want to fuck, but not vice versa
My work is love no complaints I'm fine
Its been a long night can't wait to close my eyes

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
I dream of an industry ego-less
And free from the modern chains with these chains we're so deep in love
Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
Dreaming a publicist wasn't 2 G's a month
And where it's not about numbers and math
And I was content with really just a couple of fans
And my happiness wasn't relying on tours and a van
Merch sales, iTunes, MySpace and a band
With the front, front row stadium packed
And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
And scream at them "Look at me now, look at me man"
Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
Fuck being humble, humility is a step in the past
I woke up and realized it was a dream
Wide awake in the rap game, but life I'm asleep

[Hook][Verse 1]
The other day, me 'n XP opened for Souls of Mischief
I'm like "Yo, let's get on some angry MC showmanship and hit 'em"
Rocked all the cocky songs and not too many soulful lyrics
Even a couple dissin' women callin' 'em "groupies," "hoes," and "bitches."
Got off stage, and I'm like "Yo, I know that we killed it,"
Ran into a familiar face, a female who comes in and supports us
I said "Peace!" She said "Wait! Let me talk to you for a minute
I know it's none of my business, but I wasn't impressed by your performance."
I said "Word? Shit, I love feedback and criticism."
She said "I miss the passionate spirit, your political vision
Quite honestly I wasn't offended by those references to women
But you're only continuing society's conditioning."
It hit the heart of me
I told her that this was part of me
I stand up for human rights, and treat others how I would wanna be treated
But every song can't be seepin' with freedom
'Cuz the other side of me is sexist then people will feel that I'm preachin'
"Everything's peace and love?" uhh, that's somewhat misleading
Because this world is fucked-up and I'm a pro-duct to what I'm seeing
Not to justify, but just to touch on my being
I learn from these verses and my purpose gets surfaced with demons
Now I am sexist, I'm prejudice, I put that in my music
She said she heard that perspective, but before she turned around
She said "We have a flame, your fire's ignited with sound
Are you building the empire up, or using your fire to burn it down?"

[Hook x2]
Consumption, contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
The differences, I admit this shit, because I'm just like you;
Walking a fine line between saying and living it

[Overvoice]
Light it up to burn it down, light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down, down, down
Light it up to burn it down, light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down, down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Now one thing that I've always struggled on
Is how to incorporate drugs and alcohol into my music outside of sober songs
'Cuz on that perspective, that's all over my records
But the other side isn't represented unless it sessions with XP
How can I admit that I love to smoke weed
Knowing the kids are listening and many of them look up to me?
Not to say that I'm a role model, but I know that words are power
And if I condone bottles and chronic, I am sending out the
Message "It's okay," hey I believe that it is
Chronic can be medicine, but it's all about your relationship with it
See I'm either off in the wagon riding and everyday with the spliff
Constantly looking for a balance but habit turns to addiction
And hip-hop music and weed: they're inseparable
So MCs that don't smoke or drink, talking about it, to me, seems questionable
It proves how much people just want to be accepted
And not seem straight-edge to their audience, so keeping it real is neglected
'Cuz when I'm smoking, I wouldn't wanna bump a song like this
Put on some Dev and break out the Swishers, and a bong and some licks
See that's a part of me too
And I know that I would make more money if I wasn't as true
To all the struggles of the blunted consumption I'm going through
Make music for the party, and the people support you
I burn Brother Ali and buy 50, what does that say to you?
Bring it back around
Am I building the empire up or using my fire to burn it down?

[Hook x2]

[Overvoice][Intro]
And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
We're city kids
You get what you ask for

[Bridge]
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece

[Hook x2]
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

[Verse 1]
Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer
At least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days
I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on
Close the chapter
Live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes
But those mistakes made you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality
Rarely lit
Memories, a collage pasted with glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors
Graffiti and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain
Some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again
I guess it's relative
The Camel Lights
The whiskey, ryes
Sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second wind
Grow a moustache
Pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
So here's to the nights
Dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Poor out a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real
Even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while
Just to say I visit
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find our way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

[Bridge + Hook][Verse 1: Illmaculate]
When what you want and what you can't have come in a conflict
That could cause a couple of problems
Well, I guess these ladies and labels have something in common
If they have it they own way they be fucking the artist
But, that's why I'm ducking your offers
No contracts or rings, see I'm trying to hustle my hardest, ma
No distractions, it's killing me, she's feeling me though
She's so attractive plus she knows I'm the total package
Got the pounding stimulation she needs, right?
Plus with escalation what a famous emcee likes
She like to know, squeeze tight in them clothes
Thinking she'll get the green-light to go
It don't seem right... Right, you love the attention
Most the time it don't matter how slutty she's dressing
All too often we act with ugly intentions
And they're selfishly defended when they come into question

[Hook: Illmaculate]
I see you doing your thing
I ain't trying to hate on ya, nah I ain't trying to ruin a thing
A lot of women though, I ain't pouring salt in your game
But if you'd listen close then you could probly relate, it goes...

*OnlyOne sample*
Now I ain't dissing women, now now I ain't dissing women
Now I ain't dissing women, that'd be foolish as hell
Now I ain't dissing women, that'd be foolish as hell
I just wish they wouldn't do it themselves

[Verse 2: Dain]
Chicks scoping me, I got a look from left to right cause
Anything might just happen
I happen to be in a position where I got to see
If I'ma go home to the wife or [...]
Seems like some of the girls this age
That approach you would've boned you in anyway
Tried to tell one that I'm gay
But she was like, "Nah nigga, you'll just need me to go straight"
Papa told me play the cards that they deal to ya
Mama told me just remember how it feels to ya
So my consious is playing a role
Even if I'm away on the road I stay at home
Cause I don't want nonsense
"He say, she say" – cliche high school type gossip
About me going out with a mistress
Damn, mind your bitnezz, can I get a witness?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
