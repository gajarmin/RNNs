Have you ever lost someone that you loved
And you only want to hear their voice again?
Have you ever fallen to your knees
Begging for the memories you've lost? Yeah

Have you ever tried to love again?
But you found yourself feeling the hurt
And you only want to live again
With him with her

You want to know He's there give me a sign
You want to hear Him say

That I'll be, waiting for you here
And I'll be your memories of love
I'll be, waiting for you here where the
Clouds of rain and airplanes will never go

Have you ever tried to escape the pain
But you dug yourself deeper in it?
Have you ever tried to run away
But it brought you back to the very same place?

You want to know He's there give me a sign
You want to hear him say

That I'll be, waiting for you here
And I'll be your memories of love
I'll be, waiting for you here where the
Clouds of rain and airplanes will never go

Now don't you worry you'll be fine and I'll be there by your side
You're going to make it through the mistakes you've made behind you
Now it's a brand new day and a brand new hour
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it through

I'll be, waiting for you here
And I'll be your memories of love
I'll be waiting for you here where the
Clouds of rain and the airplanes will never go

I'll never go
I'll never go
I'll never go
Never goIt's the end of our old sunset
Daddy's drunk and he don't want to go yet
I can tell you're hurting
Down inside so deeply

Your eyes and the scars you hide
Shows your hope of a better life
The way you move
Through the day and night
You tread so lightly

But I'll be there for you
I won't let you go
You can count on me
I'll get you through this fight
Your old life will be history tonight

I know you're a beauty queen
But when your eyes they look at me
The belief is gone and all I see
Are your abused feelings

There's a reason for everything
Your father's life and the way it seems
Perfect love doesn't come from
All the things you see in your magazines
Love won't leave a scar

I won't let you go
You can count on me
I'll get you through this fight
Your old life will be history tonight

True love won't let you down, baby
True love's going to get you through
True love won't let you down, baby

No, it won't let you down, no, no
True love's going to get you through
Don't you know it will get you throughYou see all of the pieces
But I see a life I can mold
You see a bunch of blank pages
But I see potential untold

Before you give up
Before your heart breaks
Open your eyes
To this picture of grace and just

Slow down take a breath in this moment
Leave all the worries you're carrying
Be still in the midst of this madness
Let go of all that you fear
Cause I've already set your heart free
So leave all the changing to me

You see the doubt and the questions
But I see the wrestling with faith
You see someone worth nothing
But I see someone I can save

Before you give up
Before your heart breaks
Open your eyes
To this picture of grace and just

Slow down take a breath in this moment
Leave all the worries you're carrying
Be still in the midst of this madness
Let go of all that you fear
Cause I've already set your heart free
So leave all the changing to me

Life is a long road, so hard to follow
You feel like you'll never win
Just trust in my love and let me take care of the rest
So you can begin

Slow down take a breath in this moment
Leave all the worries you're carrying
Be still in the midst of this madness
Let go of all that you fear
Cause I've already set your heart free
