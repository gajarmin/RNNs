[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah, Golf Wang[Intro]
I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'mma punch you, nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Poseurs looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'mma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(Oh, shut the fuck up!)
(Gunshot)

[Sam]
Samuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?[Intro: Hodgy]
I fucked this flow

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
This is my electronic press kit, I hot as some fresh shit
Nigga recollect bitch, grow grey hairs, don't stress it
I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen
She lets me in, I sex her then she sexier than my leather vans
Cause I never am purchasing, reimbursing your courtesy
Put your body on the curb to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet but me I'm extravagant
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio mixing raw
Bitches shit in my drawers like you piss in my drawers
Nigga my dick's in her jaw
I'm Wes Snipes with lead pipes, don't dabble with the apple
Cause a swagga like mine turn them apples into Snapple
Fuck the pick of the raffle, king of the castle
Nigga, Genghis Khan mansion, we the Marilyn Manson
Making money in the present, it be safe for my grandsons
African drums for when the champ come, bitch

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Suicide watch nigga, kill yourself
Opposition who? Nigga reveal yourself
How you steal our swag and figure you still yourself?
Splinter Cell creeping in this bitch, you couldn't feel the stealth
Wolves are prowling, hunger at its fucking best
I'm a beast like the gorilla head that is on my chest
Please let me flex, I'm going off I need some fuckin' bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin' head
Excuse our swag, I'm tryna tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death then I guess we looking like the living dead
Oh shit, yo bitch, look at how I'm doing you
Bitches on my dick but look at me I'm fucking beautiful
Niggas tryna figure out, but all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggas are so unusual
Wolf Gang, point me to a nigga I should prove it to
Under pressure, we just stand in the middle like hula hoops

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
The fortress is fortified (bitch)
Money in my pockets like I'm 45, Hodgy Beats recording live
Bitch I be surely high and I don't need wings to fly
I'm the air with the pigs, Left Brain, Domo Genesis

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Knock-knock, who's there? It's me
Your girlfriend had a really nice meeting with my dick (What?)
I killed that pussy and grabbed that knife
Now I got real authentic cheetah print shit (Nigga, you're a liar)
Nigga don't believe me, kiss your lady
And boy, you're gonna get them heebie jeebies?
Nigga my dick stay way disease-y, I make it look easy
51-50, I'm off the Heezy, you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
(5 albums, 100 songs, and you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
I bet you got some J-Kwon, you ain't got no fuckin Yeezy?)
Came in the game like Speedy Gonzalez, I'm fuckin' Looney
See these girls talkin' all that shit (What?)
I'm just tryna see some tits (What?)
Let's get it poppin' like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch like hocus pocus
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
Then my dick went limp so, took about 3 pills of Extenzo
Now my dick's longer than a 5 door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from kimbo on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, "Where my dick go?"
Now she think I'm 'bout to eat her whole
Enchilada, I gotta lotta that 'Preme and I'm paying nada
It seems that I'm product placement but I'm not I'm just fuckin' awesome
Yo mama look like a ugly (Fuck you) loser[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
This life is a game if you wanna play
Counting all your own mistakes
Living it with no delay
So fast I'm getting growing pains
Father didn't show me my instincts to take the open lane
I go insane
All these problems come with my growing age
Blowing haze tryna clear the doubt that's sitting on my brain
I don't complain but the kid inside me's feeling so restrained
Gotta stay golden
Let desire rekindle the flame
Searching for the Fountain of Youth
When I'm free in my brain

[Bridge]
Bring in the horns
You hear that fucking brass
That's little boy nigga with the trumpets
Marching with the bandwagon
Looking for his heart
No sleeve but his hand carry muskets
Lurking in the meadows, Oblivion
Mothafuck Geppetto, he's a leader not a puppet
Some professors nuttier than Klump's dick
So think before you blink and aye-aye make assumptions

[Refrain]
Niggas!
Your left, your left, your left, right left
Niggas is coming!
Your left, your left, your left, right left

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
They want a story - a story
I write the shit that I find very amusing
Cause all the other fucking stories are boring
It's really awkward to know that a bunch of kids do adore me
It's like I fathered these fuckers
So you won't find me on Maury
I'm still a kid in my heart so I have a problem maturing
But it will come from experiences and shit I see touring
I'm like a bird when I'm soaring, really high
And I'm really horny, from watching this porn
Nope, but

[Bridge + Refrain]

[Interlude]
5, 4, 3, 2, and where's Tyler?

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Bottom of the countdown, shit ain't been the same
Since I found out Hodgy Beats ghost wrote for Bow Wow
Now I’m the loud shock value style foul mouth fucker
That your teenage kid likes to bow down
Riding around town in Seattle
With the same shotgun that Kurt used to click-clack, boom-pow
Still suicidal but some assume that I'm cool now
Cause I got a fucking award and my own room now
Nope but I can flip shit like a couch pillow
And have my death silent like a loose vowel
The bandwagon turned into caboose, so
So, don't let that little nigga trumpet lose sound, just let him play[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

[Verse 2: Frank]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world

[Interlude: Tyler]
Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

[Verse 5: Tyler]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, faggot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
(Here’s some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building

[Gunshots][Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Look for me, lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world ends, doing eighty-five in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for"
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trifling, Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Doms, while they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs
And that's, prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'til my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans
Smoking 'till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan
20 minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
But I'mma dip, I know you must have had it with my rude ass[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Guess with a few exceptions, yeah, I'm living honest
Except I promised my momma that I would finish college, started chasing profit
Sorry ma, I ain't forget about it but if money evil
I'm hoping that you could see through all the drama and watch me get these dollars
And my ambition burn so hot, it's like I'm bleeding lava
Haters be pleading me to stop but I don't even bother
Though my approach is seeming awkward, I could see it proper
See success and I just see the fact that I don't need a father
Doms hotter than the drop of Harry Potter shit
Pedal to the metal, high-level, full throttle shit
Still searching for a reason why niggas ain't acknowledge this
I'm lost in an era where real shit does not exist
I hate the sway of things, I'm everyday cooling it
I'm getting blazed and laughing at the way they overdoing shit
I'm just a old soul sticking to a newer script
I guess I got to prove this shit, I'm truly too legit to quit

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'd like to send a shout to the fathers that didn't raise us
To every ho who hated, now unable to say much
To critics doing dirty with comments and nigga paid for an apartment
Yesterday off some songs I haven't yet made up
Black Cressida, pay up
Bars going hard as the ashtray where I place guts
Shouts to the eses who paid pesos to play us, riding in the barrio
Huff and puff blowing kush in Huf clothing articles
Kenny rolling blunts, got us stuck like a barnacle
To the bottom of your shit, ironic cause the audios
As nautical as ships, look momma, look momma
Look, your product is legit, I promise, honest
Karma got me balling up my fist
'Til I demolish your clique, pardon the clips
I am honestly as bomb as it gets, regardless of who talking
I'm farming, harvesting hits, Just me and Domo and lit
Marijuana to split between two of us
Rocking boxes easy as warming some ramen noodles up
So, searching for a way to state it right
Young, black, and jaded, vision hazy strolling through the night[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I'm smoking big killa on the Clearwater beach
And every time I speak I hear "Go ahead your honor, preach."
I'm too hot for you niggas not to acknowledge me
The prodigy could talk a married bitch out of monogamy
I'm out of reach but your posture ain't looking promising
I'm pressing pussies, gynecology, you niggas robbing me
I deserve respect, cut a check, fuck and investment meet
For all the mess it has to for tracks I handle recklessly
I'm Glen Rice from the corner, three, in there
Swimwear twisted like Dub-C chin hair

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I payed Holyfield to take the dive
Fix the drug test, we getting richer
Blood or a spritzer
Cherry oak wood shifter
In a Jaguar, shoes are made from Babar
Roll the lethal
Seats in the Regal same color as Mario Van Peebles
I'm like a young Stephen Seagal
My favorite move's a clothesline
Dragon jacket, hair slicked back when it's go time
Motherfucker I'm a great artist
I fixed the game between Georgia Tech and Wake Forrest

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Fly shit we make that, Marvel we bake that
Pull a shotty, leave your body where the lake's at
Staying foul places, strip clubs with meth faces
All my fam's thumbs smell like gloves that catch cases
Not trying to glorify, but my story's obnoxious
Y'all faggot rappers wash your faces in a box of sausage
Surpreme server, bare burger when we order ostrich
Opposite of niggas poppin' shit cause we pop lips for gossip
Fluent Jewish lock it, gun black like Lewis Gossett
Predict the profit so I prophesize the fucking profit

[Verse 4: Roc Marciano]
Plush thoughts flood to Christopher Cross
Throw out the Rollie with the salt, park the Renault
Your number was called
I grip the nine iron like golf
Wipe 'em off
At night ride the white horse with the torch
You bleed out by the court while I've leaving court
Defeat of course, my cohorts snort
Pop a wart and read the robber port
Drive a quattroporte
Step on the product with the Rockports
Spark a Newport
Whip up a stew, this is food for thought
Pursue the course and floss in the newest Porsche

[Verse 5: Despot]
Tell your stories running, walking isn't fast enough
These cats will lap you up like milk out of a plastic cup
You bastards stuck somewhere between fragile and half a chump
I'd bet you fucks a thousand bucks your dad wishes he's wrapped it up
We rapscallions, like a bundle of onions
How you find the gumption to be out here trying to function
I fixed the game dog, I'm neutering the poodle
Got the ruger to your noodle and the goons are yelling "Who you?"
The rental car's window's rose-tinted, dope in it
The credit card got a tank in it, no limit[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Look for me, lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world ends, doing eighty-five in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for"
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trifling, Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Doms, while they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs
And that's, prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'til my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans
Smoking 'till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan
20 minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
But I'mma dip, I know you must have had it with my rude ass[Intro]
Ay let the, let the beat play Imma feel it more you feel me, Imma feel my swag a little more
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah you know what I'm sayin'
Ratchets they get the penis
Ratchets get the penis

[Hook]
Oooh I get money getting money for sho'
I'm getting money for sho'
And I get high
I smoke weed and get high for the low
I get high for the low
Tell a bitch word
Hell no it ain't no love for a ho
It ain't no love for a ho
Tryna get by
On my grind bitch you already know
Bitch you already know

[Verse 1]
Respect this greatness when you see it
Bitches have it and believe it
A bashful bastard passion's for giving these ratchets penis
It's a stroke of genius
Money, nothing can come between it
And we never lenient
Swear this hustle was so convenient, pimp
How dare you pussies test the odds
First one up is next to die let me testify, I feel electrified
Man I never learn cause in a loss is where the lessons lie
Flawless how I bless 'em you ain't get the steps to mess with Gods
Peasants, we on a bubble like effervescence
Everything I got is just a product of raw finess
And I manage fam
Me and money going hand in hand
Winners circle snapping pictures for the camera man

*Camera clicking sounds*
"Pose for the camera"
"Doms! Doms!"
"Doms look!"

[Verse 2]
Get off my nuts and let me breath for a second
Young and gifted, thought this was Christmas eve for a second
Just had a plate already fiending for seconds
On the low like I was sneaking a weapon
I only speed to regression, I'm vexed
Jackie Joyner used the burners when chasing a check
Niggas chasing the couchie retracing my steps
Bitch you playing to lose cause you playing the best
Talking 'bout some bending the rules bitch I'm breaking the necks
Spit it out like emphysema
I got a strict demeanor fire my desire like Rick and Teena
Magic in a dream, since a teen I'm like that witch Sabrina
I'm a legend in these Bapes, Stan Smith Adidas
Who you barking at
I'm a new era you a starter cap
Fitted for the ride nobody got your back
We running up the money
Word to my nigga Josh Peas ain't nothing funny

And I do my thang, yeah
And I do my thang
All niggas is bitches
And I do my thang
And I, and I, nigga and if I had to freestyle
You would have to pay me cause it ain't free now
Cause I'm a, nigga you gotta pay me
Or my publishing
Cause I need that money to live
Nigga gotta pay bills
Lights and gas and water
I need all of that, I need all of that
I got a baby momma and some kids and they need all the money so I gotta rap
And you gotta buy it
And you gotta like it
I got white girls just suckin' on my privates
And I'm violent
God damn what's wrong with Dom's mind
I'm insane, I'll hit a bitch in a spine nigga
And I climb up the tree like a monkey
Nigga and the swag hella funky
Your bitch got the dumpy
She look like she got the mumps, B
And I come through in a Humvee
With dumb sneaks
I'm outta here

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
They don't show a nigga love they saying his rhymes sinister
Administer the signs of diminishing prime ministers
I sit in the studio for weeks and cop literature
Snortin' miniature lines of ideal scripture
Yeah, I write it all in my will
Write it 'till its written my passenger rights like a bill
I'm in charge like a rhino in a harness
A gladiator in a gauntlet
Kill every contestant that wanna contest
I don't strip that bitch naked she chose to undress
Once fixated on hatred I've come to confess
Now we fixated on greatness and bundles of checks
The young man's rumbling next
Fight trials 'till he's humbled at rest
I'm out fuckin' with your mumbling bitch
It was a beat now it's a run over nest
Take a hit and know the blunt smoke is hexed

[Hook][Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It's all me, I'mma kill 'em no problem
110 degrees, watch me sizzle don't bother
Please, Bet you give up to me
Cause, anything left to compete, get cold slaughter
Puffin' the best pot
Fucked in the head lock
Thumb in yo Ex Box, She suck it like Xpac
Son is the next Pac
Naw nigga, I'm the new me
A lot of niggas talking, but that shit don't really move me
Ready or not, I'm in your spot like the Fugees
Shit is real bitch, not that shit you see in the movie
I rumble for the money if I'm willing and able
I rap like I see my last meal on the table
I'm back on my grizzy, wings spread like an angel
Ain't Safe tho, I got a couple cracks in my halo
Pack loud, call that muthafucka Master Chief
Down for my muthafuckas like Master P
If you're looking for the revolution, ask for me
Pass the tree, and watch me Hulk smash the beat
Ask for beef, don't end up as a causality
You rappers weak
You see me, better ask for peace
Couple hundred Wolf niggas that will thrash for me
Now the whole world wanna smoke hash with me
Said bitch, I'm A God, no blasphemy
Now the whole world wanna smoke hash with me

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
Blow one in the air
In the air
Blow one in the air
In the air
In the air
In the air
In the air
In the air

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Bitch ass niggas don't be smoking, nigga
We be smoking hella blunts over here, nigga
OF, Trash Wang, turn up
Fuck everybody nigga
Imma buy everybody from OF AK-47s
Watch us, nigga
(pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
I don't fuck with niggas too fast to speak
All you muthafuckas too fashion week
I be working hard like an athlete
Cry a nigga a flooded river down the saddest creek
Oh, you mad it's me?
You should be glad it's me
Shit, I'm a fucking MC
Your fucking raps are weak
And if you suckas tempt me, I'm pointing out pipsqueaks
Knocking on your fucking door for beats like Memph Bleek
Dear Summer, Dear Summer, I know its hard
And I ain't working in the office
My nigga, my life is awesome
Constantly facing depression since childhood
Life was also surrounded by my morals
My nigga, this karma's corny
And my peoples doing great
And the outcome is greater
Since you niggas talking God
Ain't nobody gonna save ya
I'm your muthafucking savior
Renegade angel like I'm Xavier
Blow one in the air
(I spit in yo face)[Verse]
Dear Lord, forgive me for all my transgressions
I raise hell until it's heaven
True essence, everything to prove, but it's been a movie since dude stepped in
My crew wrecking, we could give a fuck 'bout who's second
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers
A push it on the table, don't bring your body to dinner
Just trying to get this money, whole touring throughout the Spring
How we cold all summer and sizzle throughout the winter
Goddamnit, I'm a winner
My uncle left a piece behind
A lost nigga, though I'm searching for a piece of mind
I'm taking yours to add on to this piece of mine
I really think ambition should be redefined
How melodic is the physical embodiment
My soul obvious, stay atop the column and body shit
Fearing nothing, concern is moderate
School of hardknocks and this bitch on full scholarship
Fuck it, feel free to hate on me
I just told the fucking world to hold up, wait on me
Understand that it's the same old G
Blaze more tree, burning up such a fire and remain low key
I'm the one, they told me they was waiting for the revolution
And I arrived and on that day they made a resolution
All the worn down hope came to restitution
The game need a saving, and I was blessed to do it
Collecting my respect cause now it's overdoing
I'ma get this motor on the go before my moment's ruined
The old heads say that I'm a golden student
And I just build my troubles into soulful music[Hook]
All my cars got gas in the ashtray
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray
All my cars got gas in the ashtray
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray

And we roll up that dour

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiiight!
Blowing on that loud in the gas mask
Always get bomb, nigga: Baghdad
Hit the green door, get a grab bag
Pull out my trippy slide, Nicki with her fast ass
If I cop 5 I get em 4 a piece (riiight?)
Load up Dreddy van, hit the L.I.E
Niggas rapping, they be trappin, that's a L-I-E
I really live that let me tell you who the hell I be!
Had a nigga in the spot in the Hamptons, used to grab 4 of em
That's 25 a piece at least
Nigga getting chicken off that liquid petroleum
That OG kush, I used to ounce that
Fucked a little money up, it help me bounce back
I know it sounds absurd, nigga, living off herb
But e'rybody in the world need that loud pack
Riiiight?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Bitch-ass niggas wanna sleep on me?
Now I'm a nightmare
Wait that's the spot where they wrote me off
Y'all bitch-ass niggas still right there!
Nigga I don't even fight fair
I know it might scare, don't give a slight care
I ignite yea bitch I'm so high, nigga I can fly Dom Buzz Lightyear
Had a nice year and the bitch just started
OF Tape went fucking retarded
I been that nigga, why you fuck boys stalling
I was Doms OG, puffing and coughing
Man niggas ain't real this often
But I'mma be that til they put me in a coffin
I'mmma be crack so inhale me with caution
Nigga, it be green like a jersey in Boston
It's Doms nigga, you better get real fine nigga
We in the middle of the calm nigga
And you know we drop bombs nigga
It's Smoke DZA and Harry Fraud, nigga
That's the cue for applause nigga
I had my back against the wall, nigga
Said fuck that and I balled, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Backwoods keep a nigga's mind stuck
Off OG niggas tryna OD
With a NY bitch who want a mouth rush
She let a nigga skeet, all the girls know me
And I got the head too, cause the weed's so good, made a bitch say "Q!"
And a nigga so faded, racked out man a nigga straight made it
And you won't hit it if you're corny
Just got a ounce, more dope for the homies
I'm a rap Willie Nelson and Monster Kody
These raps is the end
I don't fuck with Kony, sliding in a Benz, no top up on me
50 for the bill, nigga fuck that Tony
Ride around gettin it, smoking on doty
(Fire pack)
My mama with a bag with a little bit of hash
My daughter hear my grind and she had covered it with cash
Brought behind the wheel on me and gas
My nigga was in my drawers, so she smothered me with ass
Girlfriend are bugging, happy cause they keep me hoes
Switching up my flows cause a nigga getting blow
Dollar after dollar, man, this money getting old
Still buying eighths, what you know about O's?

[Hook][Verse 1]
Now as time moves on and my clout gets bigger
How manny bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Iphone full of missed calls from this sick broad
Only fucked once, she complaining how she miss dog
Bitch chill there ain't nobody tripping over here
Appeared to have feelings watch me make them feelings disappear
Yeah, the magicians here, just kicking it
I'm sick with this pimping shit playing hoes ridiculous
I ain't got love for them only 'bout the grind
It's hunger on my heart and desire on my line
These other smoke behind, must beating through the fast lane
She pipe blowing no rice throwing keep your last name
I let you hit the weed, what else could you really need
You high and delirious telling me, you can't breathe
When you're without me, you don't know how you should be
That's the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese

[Hook]
Thats the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese
And bitches under my sleeve, yup, tryna smoke my weed up
Reefer, that's what I'm talking 'bout
Sativa, Indica, you need to listen to me
Little girl, you acting so basic (Bitch)
I'm tired of your payless ass
You need to cop some Asics, you basic (Bitch)
You need a mothafuckin' facelift, I like 'em classic, dinosaur Jurassic

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Same old, same old, bitch you's a lame old
You're not the pot of gold to be at the end of a rainbow
It's Ludacris abusiveness, I ain't got time
I'm busy on my music shit, is Nike tryna do this shit?
Hodgy back to prove this shit and watch the bank approve the snitch
With big checks in 'em, recognize a pro, he bring the vets with 'em
Respect the vibe of hoes countering long neck syndrome
Average is basic, day five well day six
Different day, same shit, my high speaks my language
Articular terminology, follow me or swallow me
Shallow me, blow these basics off
Like kush Cali weed, basic meaning basic salary
Face lift over exceeding calories, instead of weight watchers
She getting donuts from Valerie's, colors flux from mood rings
Now she ain't happy, the hood rat come out
And the weave gets nappy, Hodgy leaving this ratch

[Hook][Domo Genesis]
Coming for glamour and glitz, my plan to get rich
And turn the table, I'mma get the upper-hand on this shit
Fuck if it's quick, we eventually get to the shit
Don't need a co-sign, I'm knowing that my shit is legit
Shit getting ripped, yeah this as sick as it gets
I picture this shit, now it's looking as sick as my clip
Full moon warriors kicking down the fuckin doors
Crazy world, so we stuck on the grass, like herbivores
And if we moving, know that there's cash involved
I guess this what Nas meant when he said "The World is Yours"
Get out the way children, go do your chores
I'm a dog tryna get the bullshit up off my paws
My crew's small but the minds all strong
So even if one fall, we don't really take a loss
Maneuver like a boss, I pay the cost when I get the bread
Guillotine flow, keep getting sharper, I'mma stay ahead
Sleeping on me? Eventually you gotta make the bed
Cause all my shit hot like somebody tryna escape the Feds
Wild child, killing my wild style
Ambush, pow-pow, put my medal style
Gold chain and OJ's is what we about now
And when it comes to smoking, I'm your highness, so bow down
Coming at you raw live and rugged
Bitch niggas hate it, real niggas gon love it
Under the Influence but stay over the oven
Mixing drug music for your fucking crackhead cousin
I was that nigga back when you niggas said I wasn't
And now I make gold: every single thing I'm touching
Disgusting, allergic to the lame shit
Location and numbers change but, I be up on the same shit
Shout out to errybody who gave me all the patient
Odd Future fucking Wolf Gang, I bank shit

On and on, and on, and on, we still under the influenceYo bitch say my name
I'm flyer than a plane
I'm crazy like Maine
Drip drip drip drip rain (WOOO)

I'm fucking crazy (WOOOO)
Got Pampers like a baby (WOOOO)
Niggas know me (WOOOOO)
Nigga you can't touch me (WOOOO)

Bitches in my office
Bitches in my office
Niggas tryna off me (WOOO)

That's why people acknowledge me and I ain't even friends with them
Call a ho then stall a ho I'm also dope across the rope
Catch my fade I bang grenades and beat your face 'til it's off your throat

[Verse 9: Domo]

The shit he speak got him all antsy like his Christmas week
Silly me, riding with several bitches with slim physiques
And I'm tryna see lights cameras action like Mr. Cheeks

[Verse 10: Hodgy]
Army fatigue Bape boxes for the league
No ghetto barrettes and weaves down to the sleeve for the fees
If packaged she'll be petite know how to roll up my weed
Her doing's doing the deed and she don't really need shit

So meet me in the trap; it's going down
MellowHype, leaning like the jaw of Bobby Brown

[Verse 16:Hodgy Beats]
Cops arrest me for a DUI prohibition
We don't need you motherfuckers to stop and listen
Golf Wang, BitchThere used to be a dream, I guess I made it happen for me
Promise in my eyes, you can read it like a allegory
The game is mine, you're not even in my category
Raped it at a young age, I guess it's like statutory
From California where everybody has a story
You getting lucky if you make it out to get the glory
Feel I be out my mind but I figure it'll happen shortly
All I ask is patience, get a bowl and pack it for me
Left school since then nothing's been the same
For better or whatever really can't complain
I got a little money and I got a little fame
Still smoking everyday to ease my mind and maintain
Addicted to success all I wanna do is gain
Drug with ambition I can feel it in my veins
Crazy how these kids overseas know my name
I was on stage in my Bape Chucks out in Spain
Groupies started coming but that's never on my brain
I'm either thinking money or I'm sleeping on the plane
Haven't been home I got too much to attain
Still niggas hold it down it's loyalty to Wolf Gang
Kept it OG, even when they fronted on
Never been a nigga comfortable with getting stunted on
Thats why they can't figure me, kill them when I'm dropping bombs
Never saw it coming like blind bitches do in porn
Only 20 getting on living like a boss
Smoking like a champion, dressing up to floss
Niggas working ass backwards fucking Kriss Kross
Barking like a big dog but these niggas all talk
And no one the corner has a swagger like mine
To hear that I'm legit don't take a day of sunshine
Wouldn't use a second of my time to worry about a bitch
Too busy in between smoking weed and getting rich
I'm on your channel bitch, I can see you locked in
Real nigga put it on blast like a Glock 10
Wolf Gang reign supreme you niggas boxed in boss shit
All these niggas who said I would not win? Fuck them[Intro]
BlackenedWhite

[Verse 1]
They said a piece of my ambition's ambitious
Hat back, snap back, Brooklyn Мишка
Movie role, studio, rubber grip in my cuticles
Coohie yo the stupid ho who fall for cupid doe
I can't fall in love with a bit of shit
Cause if I fall into it, it's being used and then quit
You more on the bitch, I'm on the analog sticks
You can quote me on my sentence nigga, catalog this
Odd Future wolves, ain't some passive artists
A bunch of massive artists, hang up, I had to call this
We mosh through streets like a pack of walrus
So when we come around them niggas had to ball fists
My swagger is natural flavor, then citric acid
Honey ginseng if it's extracted
And honey's with me if she's attractive
Her address, I address, my hoop in her basket

[Hook]
Man, when it came to school, I got bad grades
Now, when it came to the law, I didn't know how to behave
My nigga but with music, music, music
I'm on the honor roll, honor roll, honor roll
With music, music, music
I'm on the honor roll, honor roll, we on a roll

[Verse 2: Domo]
Threw my condolences to bogus shit, cause I'm killing shit off
Survival on the love boat, I'm kicking every bitch off
Phone book flow, this some shit you'll never rip off
Shitting on you niggas, I'm a level past piss off
Risk all to get all, I'm all in
Leaving every bar spin, getting paper, I don't do go cigar, friends
Give me a couple seconds, I'll be leaving with your girlfriend
Gotta get in fresh, got her mouth full, gargling
Spit it out
Dealing with the mary by the big amount flying from a different route
Money 'bout to come so these bitches trying to stick it out
You ain't special though, give me neck and then I kick you out
Domo Genesis, it ain't nothing next to that
Aiming for success and won't fall for nothing less than that
Wolf Gang shit, got all my niggas repping that
If we ain't it yet, somebody show me where the best is at

[Hook][Interlude]
Man, it has been a while, hasn't it? Y'all reached the end of Under The Influence 2. And it's just a hard feeling leaving y'all, you know what I'm saying? Y'all been here to support me, listened to what I had to say, and it's all just coming to an end now, you know what I'm saying? But if you ever feel like life is getting the best of you. You down in a dump so you need a twist to turn around. You sobering up. Let's roll up. Start this from number 1. You know what I'm saying? That's what I'm here for, that's what I do for my peeps. I'm the people's champ. Domo Genesis. And this was Under The Influence 2. I just wanna give a shout out to my mom. My nana and papa. Cause you know they held your boy down. The Clancy's, you know what I'm saying? Everybody in the group. All my niggas from Inglewood

[Sample]
Forever mine, ooh, you're one of a kind, ooh
Oh baby, I got what you want, you got what I need
Oh, we were made, made for each other

[Interlude]
I'm about to get out of here, peace

[Sample]
Forever mine, all because you're my kind
Oh baby, I got what you want, you got what I want
We were made for each other
Oh baby, you are that someone I been hoping, I been looking[Verse 1]
Niggas wishing I fail
They got a better chance with quarters in wishing wells
Brains refused 'em, but still wishing 'em well
Elevated thoughts, but you can see from the smells
Fast living and ash flicking
Parties with bad women fashion and big cash spending
I'm passing 'em, car with no gas in it
Bitches falling love over night they passionate, pass the shit
Nothing but big kush joints love me
Cause I'm rose bushings lyrics got a good point
Rap it how I live it, live it how I'm rapping
Promised last year I'd dent it now it's cracking
Making shit happen, little nigga big dreams
Take the game double player like I got split screens
Smoke big trees and count big cheese
Hands to the hair line salute the whole team, yeah

[Interlude: Tyler the Creator]
Told y'all niggas y'all wasn't ready, nigga. Domo Genesis is killing all you niggas. Niggas, Rolling Papers in this mothafucka. Smoking weed, fucking bitches and eating cereal, nigga. Domo, hit these niggas off

[Verse 2]
Lips wait sealed with a born rich
Hit 'em in they head with shots come like porn flick
Horse flick like boards went, liquors get portioned
Louis Vuitton checkers printed, on some board shit
Cords get plugged in in the rush, no endorphins
Blazing 'til it's done, bring some more in
Steady getting blown, bitches, no maticon
Light skin, long hair, board and abort 'em
Sicker than St. Jude's, chemo get spit at
Got good ways with cuss words and Syntax
Big stack, shitted on, no elax
Thirst that bitches want watered down for relax
This where your bitches will be at
Hand on hairline, make sure them niggas see that
This where your bitches will be at
Hand on hairline, make sure them niggas see that

[Outro: Tyler the Creator]
Niggas ain't fucking ready, nigga. Told y'all niggas Rolling Papers coming in this mothafucka, nigga. Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All Don't Give a Fuck, nigga. Now roll that join up. Smoking gold with this shit right here, nigga. Yeah, we ain't fucking playing with these niggas, man. You think we fucking playing, nigga? Fuck that[Intro: Kanye West sample]
Y'all might as well get the music ready kuz this is fin to take a while

And i've been working on this thing. They've told me about humble...humble-ness, humility. Um, i don't like it. It doesn't feel natural. But I hear it works for a lot of celebrities and brings them a long way when they act like they don't deserve things. And now i'd like to thank people at the label who i know like: Rob Pasco and Matt Voss and Byron G....


[Verse 1: Evidence]
Byron G!
I give a fuck who's who
I chef the same when I'm preparing it
From bad kid to semi-rich middle-aged American
Rooted in my heritage, wounded for the derelicts
The root of every evil is the truth of all appearances
I crack the sound but the beat is still a barrier
And every fucking inch of every street around this area
The Venice carry us up like dough rises
Rap transit all city, no license
The city is beneath, I watch it from a bird's eye
Brain dead, two left, they shot me in my third eye
Shot out my eye like a BB gun on Christmas day
Reach for pistols as I watch the fuckin' Pistons play
I set the tone with the writings on the wall
The city cleans it up like we inviting 'em all
Evolution's all messed up now, chop the middleman
Stab the messenger, not the literal
I ran without a cause and was the best before I knew shit
Before I took a cruise ship, before I been to Houston
I ain't tying up loose ends I let 'em waiver
Pulling out these lavers and pounding out the pavement
Gone

[Hook]
I'm the lyrical gangsta

[Domo Genesis]
I be a young motherfucker of the rap camp
Style symbolizes my nastiness like a tramp stamp
Wamp wamp, where it's at
Fear fact, just let them legends die and I'll inherit that
I'm fit for the carry, weight of the world I carry on my back
With a fairer sack, inquisitions to the mirror
Exactly what niggas fearing, see the future in it's clearest
It is I, Doms, dropping lyrical pipe bombs
Until an icon, I choke your life like a python
I'm who the children look up, probably got 'em doing kush ups
Super high, call me Superfly, bitch I'm Jimmy Snuka
Got you feeling like you took a hit of heroin
And that's for veterans, the way I bury 'em, embarrassing
You know better than puttin' that fire near the kerosine
I said don't make me tell again like kids with speech impediments
They can't see where my head is, I'm ahead
Roll the credits, roll the medics
Getting high till I feel I'm copacetic

[Hook]

[Scott Caan aka Mad Skillz]
Yo I've been trying to keep it silent, my tendency to violence
The suit and tie be fading, the truth about the shining
The sliding through the masses, smiling eyes through glasses
My style been altercated all the while to pile my cash in
But fuck that though, I want a ho that stay up late
My dirty bottom bitch to fuck with me until the wake
Mad illegal C.R.E.A.M, ain't no rules, that's the dream
In regal swimming pools prepping tools for future schemes
Laying low and creeping it, selling dope and sleeping it
Wrap the dough up in a rope, keep in what I'm sleeping in
Mattress fettucini, life's a flick and I'm Fellini
Pinky diamond rings above the rims of ice martinis
Trees throughout the day, hour focused in a haze
We living life the most, been comatosed all the way
The toast to hell that may, cause making bread legit's too real
So I'm folding on the stress of life to steal to catch a meal

[Hook]

[Outro: Paul and the Magical Sleigh bell]

Wankland Audio Paul and the Magical Sleigh Bell Part 1

Narrator: It was a cold and stormy night when the one young paul sat scouring by the fire light; composing away. It was another Christmas. The carolers outside his window sang with glee as they rode by in a sleighbell that created a sound that was so magnificent that paul ran to the window

Paul: This sound, i must capture it, but how?

Narrator: He set about to scour the land in search for the most resilient and brilliant of sleigh bells. His father said he'd lost his marbles

Paul's Father: Paul, I'm your father. You've lost your marbles

Narrator: But no... young Paul, steadfast in his ways, travelled the land far and wide, capturing the sound of every sleigh bell he could. He travelled... oh the might![Verse 1: Evidence]
Uh, yeah
The first rule of business is mind your own two
Cause it ain't hard to make a shit list especially when the rhyming is through
I keep a distance, never been predicted
Never been a victim of any math defining my moves
I keep a needle to the wax and keep my eye on the groove
Present the evidence and every single client is true
I'm out for gettin' it and not forgettin' it
These are differences of different elements inside of the booth
It's all you

[Break: Alchemist, Action Bronson]
[Alchemist]
Ride dirty, transport filthy
Trench coat white leather to the floor milky
I killed a chinchilla and left the store guilty
[Action Bronson]
The velvet was crumbled but the velour silky

[Verse 2: Blu]
And i crushed it like butter leathers on my futon
Tossing money like croutons
Make the pair fit gator boots on
With the newton
Rolling the new triple south central
Dipping in continentals
Pin it quick to shut up and kiss the instrumental
Shits official like it came with whistles
They know the drizz when they roll with blizz
Crack the tree roll the sour d in a fronto leaf
Follow me, I tell it how it be
Like that's how it is

[Verse 3: Domo Genesis]
How the fuck you shit on a nigga who believes in himself
Inebriated on my dreams, I had to see for myself
Even my family couldn't see what I felt
But that ain't stop me nigga
Watch me mute your talking I don't need any help
I'm creeping in stealth
Driving and proving I'm nice to these niggas
Jiving trying to provide em through all the whack raps
You cats supply em, I'm lying
I'm the epitome of the perfect timing
Purpose writing got me surface riding
Dawg it's perfect science

[Verse 4: Blu]
We shoulda went half on a boat
We toast mimosa's
Had the chauffeur pass me my coat
The day was over
I told her play the grown up she suppose to
I would toss the g
But it's just the g she knew me
The corporate office often
Will say your boss and the boss' bitty
I couldn't find a better bitch to boss it with me
We talk of titties or we talk of titties
We talk bikini's
Now Puerto Ricans envy so we talkin mini's
Damn

[Verse 5: Alchemist]
Pardon me I'm just thinking on the angles
You disconnected due to the friction on the cables
You flipped on me, switched the position on the tables
Surfing on a cloud blowing kisses at the angels
I'm still out grinding, chasing the dream
Nights I slept with my face in a machine
Seven weeks in thermal and denim jeans
Dirty from the trenches my record was never clean
I'm a front line soldier
When it's possible I steal blood
It comes with the territory my boots carry mud
Scheming on the next young stallion that got strut
Somewhere in between too much and not enough

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Damn
I still remember when I broke the roaches open
Now you see us floating on a boat and uh
To say this was my dream would be a lie
But nowadays it seems to keep me in the beamer breezing by
Nothings forever right? I don't know man
I like the show for now until they change the program
Since I was one second old I've been a grown man
Showered in cologne and own my own land
Oh manI got sixteen sixteens and if I write one more song
And I'll be at seventeen again like Zac Efron
You punk motherfuckers get stepped on
I'm best on any beat that I take a mess on
I see right through you like you got mesh on
A hard body, like Brianna's dad I get my flex on
The best one, my name gets spoken 'bout
Cause I spit crack verses that bring smokers out
So know your route filled with unleaded
As I escort this beef to death like the paramedics
Yeah I said it, everything thing I touch is deaded
Tyler directed the funeral and this just got beheaded
Forget it, the killer's in the booth
And I'm drunk off this serum so all I spit is truth
And I don't really rap I am panic on this muse
How you get killed using verbally abuse
It's dead, somebody call the coroner
This is what it sounds like when Domo Genis cornered you
You're gone, knife to the neck
Just for respect, bitch this is OF
Yes I'm crazy, I'm a bastard
All I spit is dirty like pornographic rappers
Stop, you're dead honey
Cause I eat you all up like I was Ted Bundy
No funny, where the fuck you bunching?
I'm a serial killer, don't get your Cap n' Crunched, bitchWolf Gang

Golf Wang

Swag me out, bitch
In an $8000 outfit
Y'all hear these niggas talking, it ain't about shit
I'm on 15, these niggas on Cloud 6
Tryna get to 9, I'm who they get behind
Thirsty to get some shine
But bitch, you can't skip the line
And time won't even give you minutes
Cause this shit is mine
You live that ad-lib life, with the unscripted lines
I kill em all, just ball, no evidence behind
My steps too complex, you can't convict the crime
I'm just a criminal, high to my last breath
In and out of cities pushing missies till no gas left
Street ballin, I was rushing out my Timex
And I'm about that fucking scratch paper like a math test
That good shit is forming back, Rogaine
And they so plain I can't feel em: cocaine
When it's in the nasal and you're facially numb mane
Snorting all them five dollar verses, them shit's is chump change
I'm on my grind, that's some cliche shit
But if they see me anywhere, my enemies hate quick
Like "he ain't even swag, nigga, he can't spit" and
"Everytime he come around we feel like we ain't shit"
Save the chit-chatter, it's money to get after
Cheating in the book of life
A nigga about to skip chapters
From flat broke to phat quotes, I'm a real bastard
And I smoke weed til I feel like a Zen master
It's certified homicide, I'm a clit' master
High class pretty bitch basher, big kush asher
They told me Domo you're the chosen one
Convincing every single bitch that they the only one
This shit was cute even way before the song begun
If I'm not a real nigga, then show me one
But bitch, don't show me none[Verse 1]
Damn, I never pictured this
I'm so high, this shit's ridiculous
Where did I put my shit?
Wait, wait, okay, here it is
As I light this place up
Just me alone, so the joints get faced up
Floating through the stars, my whole nights all spaced up
And my thoughts tryna build my place up
Phones buzzing, so I reach and try and read it
But my visions kinda blurry, so I really can't see it
Something important, it might be it
Or maybe a bitch that don't need shit
Close my eyes and the shit that I'm seeing
Is the reason that I be in the moods that I be in
Damn, I'm really baked, I can't tell if I'm asleep or I'm awake
I'll just sit and wait, yeah, I'll just sit and wait

[Interlude: Tyler]
Domo, nigga, open the fucking door, nigga
Shit, we got shit to do come the fuck on, it's cold nigga

[Verse 2]
Let me try to sober up
Throw some water on my face, only if it's cold enough
Confidently wiping my face with my shirt
Looking in the mirror like that ain't work, damn

[Interlude: Tyler]
Domo, open the fucking door, what the fuck are you doing?
It's not funny no more, I'm cold as fuck nigga
I ain't got no inhaler nigga, shit, open up

[Verse 3]
Okay, I'm coming
Walking to the door and I seem to notice something
The floor is just a cloud of smoke and I'm running
Reaching at the end of the cloud and I'm jumping
Flowing through the air just about to hear something
Feel a lil shake and my body start buzzing like

[Outro: Tyler]
Nigga, you good? (Yeah, I'm cool, dog)
Talking in your sleep and shit nigga, you tripping (Shit, my bad)
