[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so don't rush me
Love is patient and now you gotta trust me
To take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm or an unborn
Carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for his start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasn't built in a day
And diamonds need a while before they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
I'm paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste and she said it wasn't ready
She stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
I'm just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta stall the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses
Nah, I take my time and compose this

[Hook]
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
When you bustlin' hustlin' for the numbers and
You missed the journey if you climbed too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need a balancer
I want that legendary like excalibur
Chasing calibers liberated as a bachelor
Traveler, never falling victim to these calendars
Rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting on my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when I'm talking bout chess
Tryna do more when I'm talking bout less, I stress
Quantity ain't always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
I'm resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your momma's yard

[Hook]

[Outro: Nitty Scott]
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See I'm just a lilac tied to the earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Yo, I can see it in your eyes, think you just got two
Fascinated with the new flu, two by two
All my zoo shit true and I'm too badu
I be all over their head like the shampoo do
Snoozing on a revolution so I blew by you
Literally leave your body in the Blue Bayou
We be looking at your troopers and your crew like ''who?''
Educating, elevating on your boo IQ
Pledge allegiance to nothing, I got the wood and he crushing
My kamikazes are coming to light Picasso percussion, you dummy
Little bummy ain't a damn thing funny
You so poor, honey, all you have is money

[Hook: Nitty Scott]
So inhale the fragrance
I be the apex, ho, get on my wavelength
Another like me? Highly unlikely
Hiding in my psyche, I dare you to come and find me

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I dare you to come and dare me to flip and commit a homi
I promise to God I'm probably the God of rhyming
Dividing the profits with prophets, prophecy wasn't lying
I grew my hair out just so I could look like a lion
So when I say I wore it, that metaphor is more exciting
I understand that, for sure like beach homes and sand crabs
Bonjour, bitch pardon my French
I never been to France, but I like to kiss like them
Consider this the Kiss of Death like Jada came through
Nitty, you know it's love when they showing hate, boo
Food for thought, hope you get a plateful
Lately I done turned the booth to a dinner table
Young mindfuck, what the fuck you thought?
Fire in my eyes, in my shades it's dark
And I'm still getting used to this famous part
They say I sold my soul, but what about what I bought?
Soul
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
It's rap game, little Bhudda baby
I take it you can hang in spaces with mother nature the Bhudda lady
You feel my nexus, I'm flexin' my solar plexus
We can have a flower orgy and keep it all in an essence
More dread from warheads
They want the poor dead, but I fed the universe on my forehead
And did this happen beforehand?
Now face it, they just basically erasing them glitches up in the matrix
Always thought the term Black Magic was kinda racist
And I have yet to find intelligent basis for all the hatred
Attracting and deflecting a core of my star portals
Ain't it gorgeous to be mortal? I couldn't be more cordial
Now who dare stare into the hazy sun?
I tell 'em it was I, Nitty Scott the wavy one
I move things that move things with mood swings
Got these niggas kissing my mood ring, I'm out

[Hook][Verse 1: CJ Fly]

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
It's the
Queen of the cosmos, cream of the convo
The wavy Buddha baby, get your lady a poncho
Hit you with the [?] flow, the two-piece combo
And rap for Eric Garner, we ain't fucking with five-o
A bright being inhaling these God particles
Why these niggas whine like Jamaicans up at the carnival
Uninhibited in habitats to be had
You just pack a lot of racket with an act to be mad
Young, black, and gifted and no gas, I'm lifted
Know that I'm crafty when I crack the cryptics
Where are the pickets, I picks on the bigots
And why when you kick it all I hear is crickets
I been true, pen game tend to offend who
Fronting on the camera just like pretends do
I was rocking venues I couldn't get into
19, right, never guess what I been through
You're missing the old me, so listen to old me
Refuse to let the motherfucking masses control me
Used to love the caterpillar, now you hate the butterfly?
Fronting on my catalog like I don't keep it [?]
Fuck it, I recover, suckers utter in another life
I just feed them supper like a rubber in your mother's eye
Ha, so won't you pass it to a pacifist
Tired of these hoes getting fancy with Kirk Lazarus
That was hazardous, but I speak compassionate
Fuck it in my bucket, word to Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Blasphemous, I mastered this, ashing on an activist
Said she want to see the [?], she had to be a masochist
Y'all ain't got no poetry, all your talk is cancerous
Art school mommy, catch me macking with the manuscript

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Motherfucker I'm a sick puppy
I'm like a young husky with tapeworms
I came in here to spit, if they stutter I'm taking their turns
Cause I'm so F-F-F
Fucking nice that only a turns
Battle? You'll be leaving like Spawn, covered in face burns
Me on the mic, you'll see the coroners watch
Just waiting to carry what's left of the beat up off of the block
The company that brought me here
Knows that I'm RAW when I rock
Your jaw's gonna drop whether written or off of the top
Italiano, I'mma bring a pot of sauce to your spot
Do you like Michael did Solanto when that officer watched
You'll barely get to taste of veal, quit your talking and stop
I'll [?] just like a cowboy killer Marlboro box
Say I'm not dope? They almost like to argue a lot
Cause y'all are tripping like you're on that shit that Mario pops
But I'm a fun guy, women say I'm awkwardly hot
That's why your girl is at my parents crib offering twat
I'm like
"Honey, my mom and dad are here
So let me call a cab up dear
While I do that you look up a telly on Google Maps, you hear?
And nothing too expensive
I'm not broke but I got taxes, it's cool
Watch the work I put in, you'll call me Vladimir"
Lyrics out the stratosphere, I'm over your head
Killing shit, but haters want to see me choking instead
Want to see me? Shine a black light right over your bed
Now you know what your girl been doing
When you go to your friend's
Get more neck than an egret wearing a v-neck
Don't even know how she can breathe
Why she ain't leave yet?
They call me Webby, got that Peter Parker reflex
The most underrated emcee yet
Some people heard me six years ago
When they saying that Webby sucks
But y'all ain't checked up on me lately
Huh, homie? I've leveled up
Better bars, better flow, better bitch with a better butt
That's why they better bet on me
Cause I bet when they stepping up
Swing, batter batter, I'ma strike 'em when we settle up
And rhyme so fucking hard
That my wheels fell off the metal trucks
Never had no metal tucked, only gun I got is on Nintendo
When I'm pulling that shit out I'm popping every duck
You better duck up, better luck next time
Cause a white boy from the burbs is like a phone sex line
Yeah I'm fucking you with my words when I be blazing on a beat
And after this, you would think they named the papers after me
RAW

[Verse 4: Smoke Dza][NITTY SCOTT]

Nitty came to spit it and kick it like Kung Fu
See, I could off your whole catalog with a 1-2
Pop dumb lyrical puns with a fun crew
Better step your rhyme up when I come through
Droppin bombs like Saddam
Who's sane? Not me
The way I lose my noggin in hollin the melody
The people say Church to the O.N.E
So you lookin like Satan to a God MC
I'm tired of these Rap shenanigans
I wanna be a fan again
Don't nobody want another mannequin
My bars got casualties
I catch em casually
Word-vomit on the mic, don't touch it after me B
Cos that would be unsanitary
Oh Snap, it's the real life rap Halle Berry
I think I'm better now I think I'm Coretta
Get a Circa 9-0
Nitty Scott in the Center

[LECRAE]

You probably watchin like "Man, I never heard of him"
"I'll murder him, the nerve of him rockin' with pre-premiere
That's so absurd of him"
Wait until he spit a couple verbs and 'em
If you really want to hate
Wait, he got the word with him
I heard him holla Jesus the notorious
No, the most glorious homie
So laborious boring us with these choruses
Horrible let us go it's just killing us
Call the coroner
Unimpressively floorin' us
Hey this what happen when hip hop let the saints in
Tailored to snatch the mic swiftly like Ye did
But them awards can't follow you to the grave
You livin for them whips and chains? Then you a slave
Prayer don't stop time, it kills hours
They lookin for a saviour, but we killed ours
Still he rose like Derrick, no bull
You wanna meet the Lord? Come holla, I got pull

[SOPRANO] (English translation)

One minute, gimme a minute
Right before my flow starts
I wanted to say to my friends from Marseille
That from now on, sky's the limit
I check the beat, unfurl my lyrics with my flow and loads of gimmicks
Call me Christopher, and today
I came to conquer America
Don't panic, I'm no terrorist
Except when this is about releasing killer verse
Like bomb atomic
As cold a rap as Alaska, master, I'm high like a Rasta
Insane as old dirty bastard, brutish in bed like DSK
Gimme a moment sista, let me print my style
In the States with a sturdy flow
The stars end up at the E. R
Statistics will show I'm unbelievable like Nicki's butt
I'm your boss from elsewhere, find yourself a job
Elsewhere, you stain my neat suit, the one from psycatra
I'm a boss nigga hun hallelujah!
You see, I'm not from here like E.T
My name is Soprano, a french guy on B.E.T

[ESTELLE]

So can I rap?
I'm looking at this clock and this clock's steady tickin'
Tryna find the words but the word's gone missin'
Whatcha talkin' bout when the world's inconsistent?
Cause everyone's shifting, yeah, everyone's shifting
I came to America, my shoes and my dream
My deal in my pocket or that's how it seemed
I lived in the hood so I wasn't going back
You see, I did all of that so then my struggle's in tact
I've been shared a room with some rats and some bees
I've been one pair of shoes where my toes would freeze
You see it doesn't matter if I ain't from here
The same shit, different currency, be clear
But here's the real real though
We're all young and getting up
Trying to be better than that bullshit they been givin' us
Got to be better than, have to be better than
90% of the bullshit they be selling us
It's hunger; got one Grammy
Need like 10 more for me to really act shabby
So I'mma say it loud, and I'mma say it proud
Make ya say my name, say my name out loud
Elle![Verse 1: Termanology]
I got bars for days, bars for weeks
That's why these rap dudes never wanna spar with me
I step in the ring and break them down like Mayweather
Never lose money on a bet so I save cheddar
When it come to bars I left a hundred scars
On these rappers' careers, I'm laughing in tears
I'm on my 50 shit, starting beef when I'm spitting shit
You funny cats dancing around on some Missy shit
Your boy fresh, cleaner than a hospital
Cooler than a popsicle, hustling them crops of dro'
Corny rappers only do it for the bread
So my rhymes leave them baked, I'll turn them to cornbread
Leave them cooked, deep fried, you [?]
What I spit, you sweeter than a beehive
Since knee high all up in these streets I
Been earning my stripes, the block wanna see me shine

[Verse 2: Ea$y Money]
Listen, I hate to say this, but damn I'm back, Term
Got bars like a franchise tavern
All my joints is crack like got damn
Got a [?] gat, will not jam
Hit the booth and I rip
Always spit truth when I spit so get used to this shit
Move with the fifth, y'all anorexic
Little on the waist, doose doose on the hip
''I'm shooting them clips'' what your man'll say
When it's beef he stole the scale, ran away
My hammer spray, left kids missing
Only time your hammer spray is when your pet pig pissin', listen
My life like a movie
I swear for arthritis he get all the writers
It's ST, all my troops go hard
Don't play the two-position, but we shooting, God

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott, MC]
The B girl specimen, hustle harder than a Mexican
I got the regimen for anyone I'm better than
Little men, jiggle these gentlemen like they gelatin
Genuine, knowing I be getting under their melanin
Toss my flow up and the crime rate go up; criminal
Lyrically killing them by the syllable
And I don't mean to belittle you when I say it's pitiful
That you could ever claim ovof a chick with better literal
These rappers so incredibly edible
Strip 'em of that pedestal and down to their skeletal
Unethical, does my menu offend you?
Man, I be selling out, but just the venue
With these butters on my feet
Word to my boombox, gun is in the street
Yo, this is Ziplock fresh, catch you whiffington
This is Emily Dickons on that piffington
Uh, and that's just how it's gone be
The kid so free oxygen breathe me
Terminating the talent, this type of talk is tactically
Witty Nitty up in your city with Termanology, what?[Intro]
This generation
Rules the nation

[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
No victims, No villains, no form
No thinking, no limits, just visions
Surrender ego then mingle with the divine
And please wipe your feet before you enter my mind
I'm bear foot sitting in the lotus, focus on my kundalini have you taken notice
Thinking I need stress, I think that it's need less
Speaking of weed less, I'm learning to need less
And over drama the Dalai Lama in nirvana
Threaten with the flow and I'm floating with the ?
Sailing ? we be in the Nile
They say they want to find the art of chill
I'm teaching them how it's on

[Intro]

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Cause I been on my let it glow
Metaphysics flow entering the indigo
And now it seem that life is but a dream
And the cloth of our reality is leaking at the seams
But it's lucid ?
Now we cruising and on the truth that I be inducing
Naked activating from the root up to the crown
It's amazing in the void until you comeback down
But if I can't keep calm, I just keep on
Sold songs to get my reborn and just breath on
And be the queen of the renaissance, Mother of the new era
? tiara get free and recognize that

[Intro]

[Interlude]
Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration
That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively
There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream
And we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather

[Intro]

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
If every eight year old was taught meditation
I think we have peace for an entire generation
Set the times ablaze, we do it in waves
And be brave like ancestors on slave ships for days
Stomach churning because the world is burning
And we inhaling the second hand, but I got a second plan
Carry the comradery to continents
We don't need religion cause we got our consciousness -ness
And I ain't just an optimist
New earth is coming ain't no stopping this
Say goodbye to buy consume die
All my realized beings will spread wings and fly

[Outro]
That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself[Nitty scott]:
Yo, they can't avoid me like the hip-hop cops
Nitty Scott be in the hip spot with a hip-hop box
Slangin' in my sneakers while I'm bangin' in ya speakers
And I only need 16 to make you a believer
Get props on my nouns, non-stop for the crown
Spit that shit that'll make you wanna put ya mic down
You know the honoree keep the party pumpin' like an artery
Pardon me but ya flow be kinda watery
1, 2, what you gonna do?
When I adjust the mic stand to 5'2"
Eat ya little lines in ya rhyme book too
Play it in rewind to remind you who
Probably form a quote off of something that I wrote
I'm just flowin' and you hopin' you can keep the boat afloat
I don't call 'em rappers, I call 'em appetizin'
Graffiti on the track, verbal vandalizin'
And this reality rap, no fantasizin'
I bring reality back and maximize it
So tell a friend to tell a chick to tell a goon
Boombox family, we be in ya city soon

[Kinetics]:
They say that life is a movie, so I broke in the theater
Took my demo and plugged it into both of the speakers
Spiked the Coke machine and pointed a strobe at the bleachers
Chokehold? I want this game in a coma, stroke and a seizer
That's why I'm either in a cypher spittin'
Or I'm kidnappin' a label head until they give my demo tape a listen
While you sit in a bath with a bag of lavender
I be ravishing with the rats and a pack of scavengers
Subway courtesy when I rap for ya
Cause I make the fans get out of their seats like an elderly passenger
My city can tell, me and Nitty prevail
I roll a philly and I'm spittin' crack - Liberty Bell
Ya record is so tough? Honestly so what?
You could wait ya whole life before anything shows up
You could rock a yamaka with Hanukkah pajamas
While servin' a matzah dish in the Gaza Strip and you wouldn't blow up[Nitty scott]:
Yo, they can't avoid me like the hip-hop cops

[Hook][Intro]
They’re my slippers man
Mammy get my slippers
Ary, where you going?
Can you fix me some soup before I go?
No, you just tell me before I tell what’s it just
You’ve got that certain something
It really turned me on
You can make me do right
Or you can make do wrong

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Diamonds tastin’, square like the 5 wagon
Passenger sit on the left
Drop a little ashes on the thigh muscle
I'm the doobie scholar
Old foreign white shooters, Tom Gugliotta
I'm an aristocrat
Flow tight like Whoopi character’s pussy in Sister Act
Or Ving Rhames in Baby Boy, catch you but naked, cookin’ eggs
Fuckin’ with your mother got your sister on the pegs
Dinos, mongooses
Redline, harrows
Rosemary toast paddle for the marrow
Got women of the streets straight emerging out the shadows
2 piece like Chris Childs did to Kobe
Catch me in the corner store, quarters for Shinobi
Ball court, I’m NB
Up in Auntie's house, chillin’ with the family

[Hook]
You’ve got that certain something
It really turned me on
You can make me do right
Or you can make do wrong

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Ok this hookah got me cooler than the Buddha
Rap barracuda think it deeper than the scuba
Spark me up a Cuba
Me and my auntie Maria, she doing Santeria
While I be blastin’ a classic up in the galleria
You know my style, go for miles over miles
Ain’t no tellin’ what a crook is cookin up to see him cook
Hit you with the remix, got your man shook
Burnin’ higher burnin’, yea I wrote the damn book
French manicure crushing up the sticky
Very trippy type to get the secret out of pickie
We tight fly so, they know how I go
Only gettin’ higher them days that when we wild go
Causin’ me stress, curve you like the letter S
Take a hit to the chest and I pass the gun to the west
Yea, Nitty, Bronson, tone is so gifted
Put the flame to the bang and get lifted

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Kid Daytona]
Yea, were you naughty Maria crib?
Ganja’s bein’ lit
Fog so thick it’s hard for me to see you here
Needy gotta lead ya here
Style’s cheap in here
While smoking on this rain that was flown in from keira south
I brought some white bitches, they go the mirror out
Slice sniffle sane only cuz it’s winter out
When in doubt, halla at your nigga
No college experience but get a lot of academics
My liver don’t like me too much
2 cups of mama Juana, really I don’t give a fuck
Shit I’m all short of happy and I line up with some cups
So now what’s in the bookings? Conscious for the judge
Trippy sticks for hash throw
You guys sure lookin’ abnormal
Hit my contacts, the past on through
Regular show cartoon and my tune a nigga rollin’
Got a 3 bedroom and your geruzza started growin’

[Hook][Verse 1]
Chilling in the green room looking for a plug
Shutterbug puffing on a gateway drug
Got a hug habit and we live from the planet
Run and tell Zagat when you put it on your palate
Yum yum sugarplum, bummin' in my fabric
Tell me what you know about a turtle race rabbit
I’m fantastic at fastening my tactics
Seems you need aid, lot of lemons in yo basket
Hold up let me ash this

[Hook]
I know how it feels
You’ve been hurt so bad, oh
I know how it feels
You’ve been hurt so bad, oh

[Verse 2]
I’m trying stimulate my mental
Rap so bad we just bump the instrumental
Copycats can’t copy raps so they trace it
My pen game like a blunt you should face it
You should face it, you should face it
Catch me with the b-boys rebels and the punks
Rum punch sucker drunk throwing nun-chucks
Cherry cola pedicure, rocking doobies to the store
Eating emcees so I be's what I munch
Ideas by the hunch
But I can’t afford to the sample that
Nothing in my pocket but a lighter and a Snapple fact
Back wood doobie, last night's clip
Might find a dollar for an Arizona sip

[Hook][Verse 1: Termanology]

Little men, jiggle these gentlemen like they gelatin
Genuine, knowing I be getting under their melanin
Toss my flow up and the crime rate go up; criminal
Lyrically killing them by the syllable
And I don't mean to belittle you when I say it's pitiful
That you could ever claim ovof a chick with better literal
These rappers so incredibly edible
Strip 'em of that pedestal and down to their skeletal
Unethical, does my menu offend you?
Man, I be selling out, but just the venue
With these butters on my feet
Word to my boombox, gun is in the street
Yo, this is Ziplock fresh, catch you whiffington
This is Emily Dickons on that piffington
Uh, and that's just how it's gone be
The kid so free oxygen breathe me
Terminating the talent, this type of talk is tactically
Witty Nitty up in your city with Termanology, what?[NITTY SCOTT]

Nitty came to spit it and kick it like Kung Fu
See, I could off your whole catalog with a 1-2
Pop dumb lyrical puns with a fun crew
Better step your rhyme up when I come through
Droppin bombs like Saddam
Who's sane? Not me
The way I lose my noggin in hollin the melody
The people say Church to the O.N.E
So you lookin like Satan to a God MC
I'm tired of these Rap shenanigans
I wanna be a fan again
Don't nobody want another mannequin
My bars got casualties
I catch em casually
Word-vomit on the mic, don't touch it after me B
Cos that would be unsanitary
Oh Snap, it's the real life rap Halle Berry
I think I'm better now I think I'm Coretta
Get a Circa 9-0
Nitty Scott in the Center

[LECRAE]

You probably watchin like "Man, I never heard of him"
"I'll murder him, the nerve of him rockin' with pre-premiere
That's so absurd of him"
Wait until he spit a couple verbs and 'em
If you really want to hate
Wait, he got the word with him
I heard him holla Jesus the notorious
No, the most glorious homie
So laborious boring us with these choruses
Horrible let us go it's just killing us
Call the coroner
Unimpressively floorin' us
Hey this what happen when hip hop let the saints in
Tailored to snatch the mic swiftly like Ye did
But them awards can't follow you to the grave
You livin for them whips and chains? Then you a slave
Prayer don't stop time, it kills hours
They lookin for a saviour, but we killed ours
Still he rose like Derrick, no bull
You wanna meet the Lord? Come holla, I got pull

[SOPRANO] (English translation)

One minute, gimme a minute
Right before my flow starts
I wanted to say to my friends from Marseille
That from now on, sky's the limit
I check the beat, unfurl my lyrics with my flow and loads of gimmicks
Call me Christopher, and today
I came to conquer America
Don't panic, I'm no terrorist
Except when this is about releasing killer verse
Like bomb atomic
As cold a rap as Alaska, master, I'm high like a Rasta
Insane as old dirty bastard, brutish in bed like DSK
Gimme a moment sista, let me print my style
In the States with a sturdy flow
The stars end up at the E. R
Statistics will show I'm unbelievable like Nicki's butt
I'm your boss from elsewhere, find yourself a job
Elsewhere, you stain my neat suit, the one from psycatra
I'm a boss nigga hun hallelujah!
You see, I'm not from here like E.T
My name is Soprano, a french guy on B.E.T

[ESTELLE]

So can I rap?
I'm looking at this clock and this clock's steady tickin'
Tryna find the words but the word's gone missin'
Whatcha talkin' bout when the world's inconsistent?
Cause everyone's shifting, yeah, everyone's shifting
I came to America, my shoes and my dream
My deal in my pocket or that's how it seemed
I lived in the hood so I wasn't going back
You see, I did all of that so then my struggle's in tact
I've been shared a room with some rats and some bees
I've been one pair of shoes where my toes would freeze
You see it doesn't matter if I ain't from here
The same shit, different currency, be clear
But here's the real real though
We're all young and getting up
Trying to be better than that bullshit they been givin' us
Got to be better than, have to be better than
90% of the bullshit they be selling us
It's hunger; got one Grammy
Need like 10 more for me to really act shabby
So I'mma say it loud, and I'mma say it proud
Make ya say my name, say my name out loud
Elle![Verse 1: Blu]
Yeah, Big Boi, and don't forget boy
Only thing, you could be is down when it hit boy
I'm just a bridge boy, tryna get Rich Boy
Put some new D's on all of that, with the switch boy
Two chains, two tits boy
You niggas know the deal Blu Pharrell like  Clipse boy
Mike Jack off The Wall like Quince boy
You think I'm just showing my ass, you thinking Prince, Bo-oy!
You used to care boy, you claiming killer but that glove don't fit, boy
You ain't holding no weight, no real bricks boy
You niggas pitching wishes at the well with the fish boy
Fuck is this boy thinking, he ain't this boy
We the shit boy, take a shit and make a wish and find a grave to dig, cause we REAL, boy!
Take a Que get off of the Tip boy
And cough it up cause, ah you ain't shit boy
You should sit boy, sis boy
Drink a fifth, take a piss and take the dick
Sit and put hair on your chest, Boyz II Men boy!

[Hook: Nitty Scott, MC]
These lil' niggas bugg-in', gotta quit the front-in'
Wet behind the ears, baby boy you just a young-in'
Rookie you ain't rough enough for buck-in' noth-in'
You ain't thuggin', nah you ain't thugg-in'
I bet you tight you wanna fight, boy
It's passed your bedtime tonight, boy
This shit don't happen overnight, boy
Just calm down, you'll be alright, boy

[Verse 2: Blu]
We brought it back son, like wax son
You just whack son, yeah whack!
Brought Jill to the jam and got gat son
You don't know what you've got until it's Janet Jackson
We go back son, like that son
'88, you was based off crack son
Me I was putting bass on a track son
I had a ?, smack you in your face when it slap sumtin'
Ask son if it shine like the black son
Didn't think sort of ink could flood the map son
So heavy that the levees had to crack son
And make you crap son, for making crap son
Don't cry son, there's no pride son
You getting stung like dad whipping that ass
For that last report card you had, you barely passed son
Pass son the math, we getting cash, Boyz II Men!

[Hook: Nitty Scott, MC]

[Verse 3: Blu]
So what you thought kid?
You was the boss kid?
You manage Ross kid
I'm Rick Ross
Off kids' heads coming off the top kid
We coming off the block with the Glocks kid
They gon' pop so they don't get popped kid
Then pop shit and turn it to a mystery, pop quiz
Popped Jizz now it is what it is kid
Tom Hanks, Chris Wallace, big kid
I'm like the Juice Crew
I know the Biz kid
Rakim before the ? , Wiz Kids
Peabody at the party
Piss kids off, when I spit kid, talk to the dick kid
Kids lost, run around with the shark
Drowned in the ground, and got found in the park
Tossed in the ditch, for walking with the 5th
He stalkin' after darted your heart
Can I live? kid
It's back to this kid
We pack the clips kid
Boyz II Men kid

[Hook: Nitty Scott, MC][Refrain]
He came up to me with some bullsh*t rap
He came up to me with some bullsh*t rap
He came up to me with some bullsh*t rap
Yo when he came up to me I told him to step back

[Verse 1]
Yo I was the best kept secret till I leaked it
Flow seasick, then I peaced it like a beatnik
Last of the the Mohicans get to geeking when I free kick
B-R-double O-K-Lyn street shit
Bozo with my nine oh-oh
Rapped around my pretty little finger like a yo-yo
Know we got that good dro, sticky like a moco
Flicking on them bics now my eyes all rojo
I give a damn about a hater
They want me like candy, baby Now and Later
So please don't approach me with a bullshit rhyme
I don't do battles, there's too many free lines

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Yo these retail-ass rappers such a gimmick
Sucker emcees trying to tell me how to spit it
I ain't with it, catch me in the cypher with the nice type
I get some hype, you can't even hold the mic right
Verbals, murder for the herbals
Vocabulary hurdles hold weight like a verdal
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
I never let this game turn me to a clown
They so afraid of heights trying to be down
So step back ya'll, it's like that ya'll
We represent for hip-hop, and not for rap ya'll

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
It's true, I get the audience thicker than a Snicker
Sweet faced spitter, you can miss me with the glitter
Kicked a little rap now they on me like a tack
And I gotta make moves like a military brat
Matter fact, listen I'm a born star
Wouldn't give a flying fuck, on the airplane with a porn star
Roar fee-fi-fo-fum
I'm a five-two giant and these rappers so yum
My God, yes I live in my pod
Armed with the facts I rap your whole iPod
Then Nitty be like hello city
To your city, then your city be like hello Nitty

[Refrain][Verse 1]

Yeah, The Boombox Diaries

Yo, I inspire to inspire
Rebel with the treble cutting through the barbed wire with a fiery desire
They say the running out of dope, need a new supplier
Till' I came on, yo is this thing on?
I gotta tell the people what it took to make this EP
How many labels tried to cheat me for a cheap fee
Trying to make it intimate while they just talking increments
Impotent but fuck it I guess I got good predicaments
I ain't a rapper, just a wordy abolitionist
Here to free the streets and ain't no pimpin' on my instrument
One for the money, and two for the show
Three for the record everybody here we go!

Yeah! Cause' I'm the last boombox
Holla "peace! peace!" when you see me on the block
(Boombox!)
I know you like that knock, Nitty Scott will keep it hot until the clock don't top
(Yeah!)
See we be like a breath of something fresh, generated generation power we possess
Rich is getting richer givin' less to the oppressed
But I'm destined for the best in the name of progress
I tell my story for the ones who forgot you; single mothers, fallen brothers, hustlers, I got you

[Bridge]
Too late I'm on for these Marilyn Monroe's
Concrete Roses
Going where the flows is

[Hook]

Uh huh, welcome The Boombox Diaries
Welcome to The Boombox Diaries
Uh huh, welcome The Boombox Diaries
Welcome to The Boombox Diaries
You are now inside The Boombox Diaries

[Verse 2]

Man I don't even watch TV
Cause nobody on the TV look like me
If I charge black cards or an EBT
I keep it Hip H-o-p when I MC
And ain't it sad, that I would have to shit in a bag
If I was a co-signed white girl with swag? Dag!
I've reached my interception
Mother of the New School Birth and Resurrection

Okay, I blaze trails like a traveler does
They want the glow of my aura
They want the strength of my buzz
And I'm learning that success is like a relative term
It brings a lot of relative looking for something to burn, but
I live the land of the frozen I am chosen
Homegrown flowing in zones they gobble souls in

[Bridge]

Too late I'm on for these Marilyn Monroe's
Concrete Roses
Going where the flows is

[Hook]

Uh huh, welcome The Boombox Diaries
Welcome to The Boombox Diaries
Uh huh, welcome The Boombox Diaries
You are now inside The Boombox Diaries


[Outro]

Hell yeah! Jewels!
We did it homie!
Hey I've been waiting to drop this project my whole fucking life!

From Grand Rapids to Florida
To Brooklyn and back
This is all I've ever wanted to do

Niggas say they had faith but ain't want to put it on paper
We good though, we good

Boombox Family!
We breathing life into this shit!
It's just the way I was raised

Let em' know that we ain't numbers, we are letters
Letters that form stories, and speak of our glory

Boombox Family, stand up![Verse 1: Rocky Rivera]
Uh, seems like yesterday we were both chasing a ice cream truck
I was so in a rush to grow up
Dancing in my momma's pumps, singing the Janet Jackson songs
With my imaginary fans in the front
So what if they was a couple of teddy bears and my mic was a brush
Yo I'm still the same girl that was riding the bus
Rapping along to the song straight verse to the hook
There’s only one Lauryn Hill in my book, and I respect that
Every time I fell in love we had a setback
First time I hit the stage I never went back
I was that little girl in the cypher
Wishes I can rhyme with them, knowing I'm a better writer but
Imma, let them lyrically compare their dick size
And by the way that they rap, it was like this size
So I made my own cypher over here
Like I don't give a fuck with these boys over here
So I never had to fuck with these boys over here
They love my style love to whisper in my ear
But I'm gone like the wind cause I got a career
Im married to the hustle yo, fuck what you hear

[Hook: Rocky Rivera]
And I daydream about it, like I wish this world were mine
So I say it in the rhyme, I say it in the rhyme, and I
Love it too much just to ever stop
Cause what I'm talking bout yall is hip-hop

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott, MC]
Uh huh, yeah
Hey hi, how you doing
I took the time to write this letter to you and
I just hope you can appreciate my honesty
Cause honestly, I constantly just want you to acknowledge me
I was, blowing bubbles in the sandbox
That's when I fell in love with your jam box
Sometimes I would repeat the things you said in the house
Then my mom's is rubbing soap in my mouth
But anyways, the punishment just wasn’t enough
I would blush, cause see I had the ultimate crush
And without you ever knowing who I are
I quietly admired from afar
Like how I know you got a thing for DJ's
Tape decks and pressing that replay
You prefer talks on the beat, over walks on the beach
Feat be, buoying up concrete streets
But then it hurt when they discovered your worth
The rings and the bling and the things you could birth
It always seem to me they slutted you out,uh
Hit you like a cigarette and butted you out
You weren't mine so I said it in the rhyme
I’ve been hear loving you this whole time
Baby I'm
Patiently waiting in my city
For you to write back, sincerely love Nitty

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rocky Rivera]
I use to love him, when I heard him on the speakers
Or underneath the bleachers when I hid em from my teachers
He was the only real thing I ever knew
But he, wanted fame so he played me like a fool
I cried like any other woman would do
Brushed myself off ye fuck you too
I got dreams I can do much better than you
What kind of chick would let that bullshit slip
I rather, do my thing like a journalist do
Momma was a rolling stone till I moved the fuck home
And I, had to watch you from a distance
You wanted me back and I admire your persistence
Still wishing, we could of been the best you and me
But your insecurity made you suffer musically
In order to grow, I had to go
But I will always have your back, and I'm hear to let you know

[Hook][Nitty Scott, MC]
Yo Jelani, turn that up
Oh, how was my first summer in the game?
*laughs* Man, I don't even know how to describe it. Like..
Just too much goin' on
Lotta, Lotta new faces, lotta new places
Let me, you know what, matter fact, I'mma just tell 'em like this
Let's get into it
Check it

Summer breezin', chiefin' on this leaf an'
Easin' on the beat reflectin' on my sunny season
See I just wanted to be heard up in my region
So I dropped The Chronicles and gave them all a reason
Pocket distribution for the EP next
They couldn't find release dates with GPS
I ain't mad, but to the fans: my bad
I promise that it's comin' and we launchin' off the pad
The Source Mag call me unsigned hype
Now everybody wanna type about my unsigned life
I heard my voice on the radio for the first time
That shit reminded me of when I wrote my first rhyme
And my brother brought a kid into the world
She was like 6 pounds and 1 ounce; a babygirl
Wish I was there to say peace to my niece
But I was in VA doin' a meet and greet
Either way, man, the streets been sweet
They knock me off my feet when they repeat my speech
Like shout out to the guy who showed me 5 hooks
Waited in line just so I could sign his rhyme book
Many flicks, many picks, many plugs, many daps, many raps, many hugs
See I felt like star when I opened up for Kendrick Lamar
I was a fan since KDot, not all of you are
And who would figure, that I'd be in the back with Rob Digger(?)
Discussin' bigger figures, comin' up quicker
I'm progressin' and expressin' with blessin's in my possession
Just an underdog in the presence of these legends
And I don't want to talk about the pressure
Let's just say the stresses is pushin' me to be better
Let's just say they wanna get cheddar with go getters
I came up then they change up like the weather
And oh! There was a murder; the victim was a rapper
Send the competition to me lyrically clapper
My life is like a movie and we in a better chapter
Flip the script on 'em, got the action for these actors
See I'm just chasin' a frame, with my name in the hip hop Hall of Fame
Went from unknown to the name on flames
Not bad for my very first summer in the game[Hook]
You know I'm down with the king
The king

[Verse 1]
I a king in a pair of jeans
Brooklyn born so I'm always close to queens
I'm close to fans, you just close to means
Internet rap nuckers ? is he
Hold your dreams, and hold your horses
I'mma bodied the beat and close the caucus
I'm ? sworn, and close to honors
My protes go on until I'm Nostradamus
It's simple, yet invective,I don't want to next
I'm invested, cells talent infested
Not a day pass I forget what I blessed with
Say no more of me than whoever they've slept with
F for shallow flow, I got a death wish
One of the best since Shey dropped breakfast
This is all I know, and all I owe
Never less than a four mic flow

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm down with the King of the cut, and what?
Adidas on my feet, I never rock And 1
That's word to Run DMC me emceeing
Catch me on TV route touring European
Blank out the canvas, then crank out a classic
Black out with rapping, the packed house is clapping
Thanks for the support, you can find me in the air port ?
Backpacker ain't a dirty word no ?
I prefer 'em north faced to pack my big words
As long as jams work, I'mma keep keep making 'em
Chop up the samples I'mma put a put a pace to 'em
Scroll on you ho's like bar tend
Drag bar ? if I got no pen, yo
Where the words at?
Love letters to the letters
It's Don Doug nobody does it better than

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So hot, in winter time I could enjoy summer
Trying to be the white chocolate boy wonder
If Stevie could see me, it's la-di-da
Cause it's three like the stripes on the ad-di-das
Laid back in a Maybach, breeze in a jet
Yeah it's crossed my mind like a sleeve when I sweat
Man, even Eli agrees I'm the best
With a shield on the mic, MP's on the desk
Here the wheeze from the breathe
Catch Z's when I rest
Spend cheese from the checks
When it's G's that's the best
Emcee in the flesh
When I'm spinning CD's in the decks
Technology has spoiled me
While I'm thinking about the punk motherfuckers with no loyalty
6th Sense, Tonya Morgan pretty Nitty of course we're royalty

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Ok, All Day I Dream About Sneakers
Dream about bumping out your speakers under bleachers
Raw hip-hop yeah we do it in the park
Got the ones and the twos like they did it on the arc
Easy to kill it when they singing along
But yo, can you move the crowd when the crowd don't know your song?
It's an emcee habit, emcee's have it
My mics to nice, to let have a femcee grab it
Now, who's saying girls can't rap I got that new boom bap
You know the tunes on tap
Flowing in my zone, so they be throwing stones
But I just recollect them, and I build me up a throne
Cause I'm down with the king and I'm down with the prodigals
Can't won't stop, till the back drop drop it go
How we got McBoogie on the chronicles?
Make the impossible I M possible[Intro]
A yo put my lucky bamboo in the corner
Yeah that’s good and light the incense the vanilla one
Yeah and slide the goldfish over here they bring me wealth

[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Hold up, slowed up, couple dope chicks when we showed up
They want to kick it with my breezy clique
I’m only rockin’ with them if they in the Stevie Nicks
They was with it, frequency off the meter
Cop the reefer then we took them to auntie Maria’s
And we rollin’ while we smokin’
He said this shit gon have you coastin’
I started laughing is you jokin’
Boy I be tokin’ you ain’t never see me chokin’
Uh, now we dozing on the potion
And I done took Frank up out the ocean
Uh, you know I roll that fatty perfectly
Make it purply in my nursery
And all my paper planes boarded
Distorted on the strain that they imported
Smell the orchids, see in my orbit
Vibes never die they are only transported

[Hook] x2
Ay, and I’m just on my Feng Shui
Give a damn what a muthafuckin’ hater got to say
And I’m just on my Feng Shui

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
And we live from a cloud of kush
I was puffing on that loud and you a sour puss
Been on my indie I don’t need a push
And I ain’t no disciple but I burn the bush
Rhyme garden, mind sharpen
Mining cause there’s diamonds in this fine jargon
From a cubby on the subway to gettin’ props from the popular it’s so lovely
Runway just a Monday it ain’t the bubbly it’s the Feng Shui
Yes I be aesthetically fresh abundantly blessed
And I’m passin’ blunts to the left

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
And tell Ab to bring the backwoods
I ain’t into swisher no more, that shit is that good
And we ain’t even gotta act hood
Speaking abstract to the facts the way that rap should
Take a pull we make these hood blocks
Turn into a new age Woodstock
Cause you know that older wild stinky
Girl you so pretty when your eyes chinky
Flight school grad it’s a celebration
For all my dedication to this aviation
Face like uh oh when the weed runnin’ low
Cop me so more and don’t fuck up my flow
Cause I know the whole team got to blow
And I don’t love these hoes blowin’ O’s at my show
All up in my grill like where you been at
Man I’m all up in my chill like where your zen at
It’s just the people that I came with
People that I change with it’s all how you arrange it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ayo where my crystals at
I gotta recharge my crystals B
Let’s do beige in the northeast you know earth tones
All white in the west get my creativity up
And no mirrors in the south none whatsoever
It’s bad chi respect the Feng shui man
What up Ski[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so don't rush me
Love is patient and now you gotta trust me
To take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm or an unborn
Carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for his start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasn't built in a day
And diamonds need a while before they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
I'm paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste and she said it wasn't ready
She stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
I'm just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta stall the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses
Nah, I take my time and compose this

[Hook]
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
When you bustlin' hustlin' for the numbers and
You missed the journey if you climbed too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need a balancer
I want that legendary like excalibur
Chasing calibers liberated as a bachelor
Traveler, never falling victim to these calendars
Rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting on my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when I'm talking bout chess
Tryna do more when I'm talking bout less, I stress
Quantity ain't always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
I'm resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your momma's yard

[Hook]

[Outro: Nitty Scott]
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See I'm just a lilac tied to the earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow[Intro]
This generation
Rules the nation

[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
No victims, No villains, no form
No thinking, no limits, just visions
Surrender ego then mingle with the divine
And please wipe your feet before you enter my mind
I'm bear foot sitting in the lotus, focus on my kundalini have you taken notice
Thinking I need stress, I think that it's need less
Speaking of weed less, I'm learning to need less
And over drama the Dalai Lama in nirvana
Threaten with the flow and I'm floating with the ?
Sailing ? we be in the Nile
They say they want to find the art of chill
I'm teaching them how it's on

[Intro]

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Cause I been on my let it glow
Metaphysics flow entering the indigo
And now it seem that life is but a dream
And the cloth of our reality is leaking at the seams
But it's lucid ?
Now we cruising and on the truth that I be inducing
Naked activating from the root up to the crown
It's amazing in the void until you comeback down
But if I can't keep calm, I just keep on
Sold songs to get my reborn and just breath on
And be the queen of the renaissance, Mother of the new era
? tiara get free and recognize that

[Intro]

[Interlude]
Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration
That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively
There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream
And we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather

[Intro]

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
If every eight year old was taught meditation
I think we have peace for an entire generation
Set the times ablaze, we do it in waves
And be brave like ancestors on slave ships for days
Stomach churning because the world is burning
And we inhaling the second hand, but I got a second plan
Carry the comradery to continents
We don't need religion cause we got our consciousness -ness
And I ain't just an optimist
New earth is coming ain't no stopping this
Say goodbye to buy consume die
All my realized beings will spread wings and fly

[Outro]
That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself[Intro]
Uh
Just let it ride, let it ride
This shit
It sound like pain
I can relate

[Verse 1]
Yo
Maybe it's the drugs
I'm giving you nigga shrugs
I'm unplugged, disconnected and bugged out
I'm all hugged out
And all I got is bars
All I got is scars
But they just want to light cigars over slow guitar
And watch me do the pole dance underneath the stars
Hold up
I'll take it back to learning to tie my laces
Familiar faces ran races in intimate places
And maybe one of those intimate paces
That move at fast paces and seek better spaces
I was divorced in the family portrait, I know my limits
Step daddy trying get up in it, I ain't with it
So I did it, bought a ticket and split it
[?]
Coach class, leave my pass on a one way
Had to take my life into my own hands some way
Hoping I can rise above it one day
It wasn't easy like Sunday

[Chorus x2]
What you know about pain?
The kind that leaves stains on your veins
I'll tell you why the cage bird sings
Think I'm going insane

[Verse 2]
Okay
I stayed in school, tried to remain in a booth
Cause it was just me
Four walls and the truth
Put my dreams on hold for survival mode
Cause the nights were long and the wind was cold
Vultures of our culture praying on my young ambitions
Telling me schemes (Uh)
Selling me dreams (Uh)
Push to the extremes 'till the hell of me screams
I'm lost in mans [?] nothing's what it seems
Nightly at the spot but I'm from your block (Uh)
Light as a rock and I'm locked if you knock
I'm patient but I'm anxious
See they're not the same thing
I just catch an overdose of adrenaline to my brain
Cold sweats, nausea, dizziness, chest pains
Automatic panic, frenetic in the fast lane
This shit is odd and I'm looking to god for a nod
I need a sign not another facade
But while I'm waiting and contemplating
I keep the weed burning
Keep the page turning
Like a long sermon
Got a curse for nervousness that's hitting the surface
Guess that all I'm trying to say is that I'm flawed but I'm working

[Chorus x2][Verse 1: Nitty Scott, MC]
It ain't hard to tell, you trying to keep the mozzarell'
While the whole damn game done gone to hell
I dominate you like a dominatrix
Hate my greatness cause you clearly ain't this
Send you on a permanent rap hiatus
Too much noise, gotta change your muffler
Super Nitty, I'm a full-time juggler
Juggernaut aiming for the jugular, yeah
Now don't be trying to say you got your hands on the wheel
Just because you got your little hands on a deal
What'd you have to do to get your brand on the seal?
Might look good, but you just not real
My flow raise eyebrows and the crime rate
Full time is my motherfucking mind state
Slim thang, but I got a big brain
Big enough to know that these rappers never eating off of my plate
I ain't show to your little cipher
Damn right, bitch, cause I'm way more nicer
Than all these little chicks on the hip-hop scene
Got 'em gassed up like they popped them beans
Probably think we got a whole lot in common
Rhyming for Gucci, rhyming for rhyming
Why? Cause we both got tits and a mic
And making words rhyme is a thing that you like?
Heard about your diss track, sorry that I missed that
I would never identify you with a diss back
Hop in the booth and the past goes missing
I passed class without the ass kissing
Play' em, spray 'em, slay 'em, man this shit is getting gory
I will tell my fucking story before I let you tell it for me
Bitch!

[Outro]
Hey, the name is Nitty Scott comma MC dot
Don't forget the mother fucking MC
Hey yo, I see you niggas out there fucking hating
Sending tweets and shit
Say that shit in my face
I'm tired of this bullshit
I've had some shit to say for a long time
I'm tired of being politically correct, you feel me?
Stop trying to fucking classify me
I'm a fucking human being, feel me?
I'm not a fucking femcee, I'm an artist[Styles P]
This is how I fly
Ha

Bubonic'd up, sauerkraut. (sssh!)
You know what'll light the way when the power's out
You know? Mary Jane, Oh Mary Jane (oh)
Need to change her hair color, got a brand new name (see ya!)
I love it when you gain them pounds (love it)
Cause my attitude sucks when you ain't came 'round. (uh)
They can judge, but they don't blow (uh-uh)
But "It's Something About Mary" that they don't know (they don't know)
Got me open like Ben Stiller! (oh)
Lookin' for my lighter cause my friend got killer (uhh)
Handin' him a Dutch, roll a ten my nilla, (fo' real)
Know what I’d do with all of my scrilla

[Hook: Avery Storm]
This is how I flyyy

Tryna get loose so I light the light
Tryna get right so light the lighter
I'mma be cool once I’ll finally fly
It's alright once you light that fire
This is how I fly

Tryna get loose so I light the light
Tryna get right so light the lighter
And I'mma be cool once I’ll finally fly
It's alright once you light that fire
This is how I fly

[Currensy]
OG cush in a glass jar
Inspired of rhymes, they buy the fast cars
No rap star, not by far dawg
You tryna have my smoke and keep my lights on
So when them hoes walk through their mind
My closet full of kids, putting my crew mix on
Taking pictures of my shit, wearing my chain
Weeded out their brains, High Hefner
Backseat of the ’99 Continental T
Giving my driver directions
Living like I’ve been here before
Some bitches, they trim it for my partners they grow

[Hook]

[Nitty Scott]
Now you’re high, clubbed I the sky
Better court or fighting marshal when my team walked by
Cause Styles brought a package from the hood pharmacologist
Doctor break the bedroom down, roll me up a document
And it ain’t nothing, we just rolling stoned
Getting fly up and slide up in the family stone
Puff to my pillow, getting serious head
I just wake up and I bake up, call it breakfast in bed
Hey, you already know that my kush cologne
It’s a little too strong for you to be putting on
I’ll show you how to make a whole ounce disappear
We sold out, you probably hear it in your head
You rather stunt in the club, I rather chi funk’d up
Catch some munchies and I hit the bodega for brog
So twist that shit, light that shit, smoke
These backwards got me so it’s blunts I'mma tow, wathup?

[Hook]

[Outro: Avery Storm]
This is how I fly[Verse 1]
Yo tryna stay vegged in my head at this empty fort
Push the curtains back with eyes open like
Good Morning New York!
Because it's not where I am it's where I'm going my friend
When I'm praying in the AM all the angels descend
So the light force around me, every block every county
Feeling rich type brownie like my destination found me
Hatin cause their characters is soft like Downy
Why you can't see a sister making moves and just pound me
Guess I gotta do like Weezy, get from round me
Jesus said that you can clown me
In the end you're gonna crown me
Now I'm the realist gangsta I know
Not because I move, but the things that I know
So you can Ditty Bop with your mind in captivity
I know that negativity the new festivity, One
My Journey to the Sun has begun
And your biggest mistake is never learning from one

[Hook: 2x]
I said I'm married to the game
So I am struggle's wife
Dedicated to the public
Man I love my life (5x)

[Verse 2]
Hey! I'm just a poet on a train
A dollar for your cup
And a smile for your game
Music is a drug so I take it in the vein
Feel no pain and distribute bits and pieces of my brain
My momma said it's just the God in me present from the fetus
She told me to be kind I could be sitting next to Jesus
My daddy worked hard everyday just to feed us
Raised me on Sam Cook and made me a good look
I used to earn an F and black on that whack test
Cause I wrote bars on the back of that math test
Focus is vital for my private recital
Fuck the final I just had to get my hand on that vinyl
[?] will bring it back like a tap to the spinal
Hopscotch, Barrettes and Boombox Cassettes
Hustlers on corners and churches with steeples
I promise I'll never disconnect from the people

[Hook: 2x]
I said Im married to the game
So I am struggle's wife
Dedicated to the public
Man I love my life (5x)(Nitty Scott, MC)
Nitty came to spit it and kick it like Kung-fu
See I could off your whole catalog with a 1-2
Pop, dumb lyrical puns with a fun crew
You better step your rhyme up when I come through
Droppin' bombs like Saddam who’s sane (Hussein) not me
The way I lose my noggin and hog on this melody
The people say Church to the O-N-E
So you looking like Satan to a God MC
I'm tired of these rap shenanigans I wanna be a fan again don't nobody wanna love the mannequin
My bars got casualties, I catch em casually
Word vomit on the mic don't touch it after me , B
Cause that would be unsanitary , oh snap its the real life rap Halle Berry
I think im better now I think im Coretta
Get a serve of 9-0 Nitty Scott in the center
(Lecrae)
You probably watchin' like man I never heard of him
I'll murder him, the nerve of him
Rockin' with Pre-Premier that's so absurd of him
Wait until he spit a couple verbs and them
If you really wanna hate wait, he got the Word with him
I heard em holla "Jesus the Notorious" no
The most glorious homie
So LABORIOUS, boring us with these choruses
Horrible at it's core it's just killin' us
Call the coroner, unimpressive ain't floorin' us
Hey this what happen when hip-hop let the saints in
Taylor'd the snatch the mic swiftly like Ye did
But them awards can't follow you to the grave
You living for them whips and chains then you a slave
Uh, prayer don't stop time it kills hours
They looking for a savior but we killed ours
Still he Rose like Derrick, no bull
You wanna meet the Lord ? come holla I got pull

(Soprano)
Une minute, une minute, juste avant que mes phases débutent
Je voulais dire à mes potes de Marseille qu'aujourd'hui je m'imposerai pas de limites
Je check le beat, déb-débite avec des phases et des tas de gimmicks
Appelle-moi Chistopher, aujourd'hui je suis venu coloniser l'Amérique
Pas de panique, non je ne suis pas terroriste
Sauf quand il s'agit mon ami de lâcher des couplets qu'assassinent comme une bombe atomique
Un rap aussi froid que l'Alaska, masta j'suis high comme un rasta
Instable comme Dirty Bastard, bestial au lit comme DSK
Un instant sista que je pose mon style aux States
Avec un flow costaud, les stars finissent à l'hosto
Les stats te diront que j'suis incroyable comme Nicki et son postérieur
J'suis ton boss, d'ailleurs trouve toi un job ailleurs
Mon beau tailleur, celui de ma Psy4tra
I'm a boss nigga, uh, hallelujah
Tu vois j'suis pas d'ici moi comme E.T
My name is Soprano un français sur BET

(Estelle)
...
So, Ima say it loud, Ima say it proud
Make you say my name say my out loud (ow)
