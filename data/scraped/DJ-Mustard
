Omarion (C. Breezy!)
(I'll make him do it, I'll make him do it)[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty

[Hook: Big Sean]
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get
Bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes that y'all don't speak the same language
I know that you just wanna let it go with all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs, wanna get away
Baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with,  is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

[Verse 4: Big Sean & (Jhene Aiko)]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing
But no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
(Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know goin' runnin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...)

[Hook: Big Sean]
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Outro]
I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places other niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the make up
Yeah[Intro: Omarion]

Yeah, yeah, that's how it goes with me
I just got a check up and ain't no ho with me
VIP bottles over D
On the couch got 'em all throwin fours with me
Hoes up, hoes down, all I gotta do is smile
You ain't want me back then, but I bet you want me now
Body going crazy, he want me to have his child
Fucking with them hoes, yeah I heard you getting around
Whisper him in the ear, tell him "I want it now"
He said "stop talking all that freaky shit, ain't tryna get aroused"
That's how it's post to be, yeah

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
They about to take your phone, just see
I don't need no hoes exposin' me
Ain't another nigga cold as me
Ain't another nigga cold as me (cold as me)
And I'm living like a movie, pretty women in the jacuzzi
The way she kissing on her friend, do she even like men?
My nigga she could have fooled me
I be tryna chill, stay tight
But they all want some, can you blame 'em?
Want their walls decorated, rearranged
Cause a nigga handsome, wealthy, famous
Who gives a fuck what they say, he say, she say
Hey Trey, ain't ya hear Jhen√© say
(But he gotta eat the booty like groceries)
You know how wild I be
Had that pussy like "Clean up on aisle 3"
Had that pussy like, slow down, whoa now, please
Every time I go down, go down like sheesh
(I make em do it!)
They know my name, I ain't even gotta say it
Put it to rest every time a nigga lay
Ain't another nigga cold as me
Butt, butt, butt naked is what you're post to be

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
AMG kit on the Benz
You got home girls, I got friends
Y'all should have come to the house
Get all topless then let's go swimming

That's just the beginning like it's post to be
Pocket rockets stay real close to me
And a new bitch stay close to me
Oh, she a ho to me

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Dead or alive, sayin' boss top 5
Let my top down just to throw the rock sign
Not Jigga, Jay Dilla and the Pharcyde
I'm the realest, disagreeing with a Glock 9
But fuckin' with us, so he had to get the Benz truck
Cutting corners, lil nigga fuck your rims up
She can't fuck with me, she say she rock with Wale
Double M we throw them alley oops, that's all day
West side, it's going down at the Polo Lounge
Half pound for my rounds just to go around
Copy paste, tweez niggas even 'bout that slang
Black bottle in the sky, free Gucci Mane

Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that its makin' me sick
I see you calling, I be makin' it quick
I'mma answer that shit like: "I don't fuck with you"
Bitch I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And everyday I wake up celebratin' shit, why?
Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'm gonna text your ass back like

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to  find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool
But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with
I ain't fuckin', I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you

Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic

Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Batgang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin'
Sippin' P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants

Rock Tom Ford and I still pop Molly
Roll up good Cali, la di da di
It's just me and all my hommies
At your door like the shining, egh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga
And the bitch that I'm with know she hot stuff
Pull up in the hot wheels, ballin' get yo hops up

I've been killin' niggas all year
Bill, me and them white folk names got somethin' in common
Bills, I got 'em, I've been at rich houses, I've been to rich hills
The homie got that Tommy, know that's somethin' that he'll feel
Look though, been really off the hook though
My fam straight, my homies got money on their books though
Lately my bitch been trippin' on me
I'm like "Bitch I'm in the studio, let me cook though!"
RJ killin' shit, my homies is killin' shit
But I'm tryna convince 'em to be on some drug dealin' shit
I can't blame 'em cause their mamas, they don't give a shit
So I fronted them some work, told 'em nigga get rich
Get rich, get rich, get rich
Mama I finally get it, hustle hard then get rich
Lately, I've been on some solo shit
Cortez, long socks, I've been on my cholo shit
Bitch you keep trippin', I'ma let bygones be bygones
Walk up in the house with high nines, I'm like "Hi mom!"
But I'm right back on my nigga shit
Like what, she fuckin' and suckin', she with the shit, let's flip this bitch
Let's flip a pound, send it out of town, then bust it down
And no respect for the hoes that wasn't fuckin', but fuckin' now
Bust it down, bust it down, bust it down
You can profit $3500 if you bust it down
Send me the plan, I'ma figure how to execute
My management like "Hold up YG!", I'm like, "I ain't waitin' on you!"
It's that 2015 flow
Kill yourself if you ain't gettin' dough
Hold up; keep winning, keep winning, keep winning
You gotta speak it to existence, nigga, keep winning
They said Dre made a billion
I'm like, "Shit, I can do it if he did it!"
Fuckin' on whatshisname's babymama
Her pussy loose, her walls broke down, she ain't got no ceilings
They was like, "YG you shouldn't go there!"
I said, "Bitch, I think I'm Silkk the Shocker, I got no limits!"
Fuck these niggas, they ain't livin' what they talkin' 'bout
Even with a million dollars I'll still spark it out
Fuck these niggas, fuck these niggas, fuck these niggas
They wasn't shootin' with me in the gym so fuck these niggas
I'm Ruff Rydin', where my dogs at?
Where them niggas that fuck them bitches on their paws at?

I didn't want to get him but I got him nigga 459
You get it how you livin' when you dealin' with the Bompton life

[Verse 1: YG]
I was out plottin', Batman, Robin
Pops was in jail, I was out poppin'
I was with the homies, you was with your bitch
You was thinkin' love, I was thinkin' rich
Everything got took, flatscreens, notebooks
Even paintings and I was an artist in the making
Used choppers, jewelry boxes, loafers made by Prada
At the pawn shop like what you got I needed all of that
Grind to shine to greedy that's how it had to be
If I ain't know you, to me you was just another robbery
Uh, clubs in the fat head
And if the neighbors saw us we got ghost like Pac Man

[Hook: Natasha Mosley]

[Verse 2: YG]
Cops comin' out runnin'
I'm thuggin', the bird come out duckin'
Hopin' they don't shoot
You only get once chance to make it to the top, and we takin' shots like hoops
I hit the wall, I hit the corner, I'm in the yard, We on the roof top
Like fuck we finna get caught, hurry and toss the ooh wa
And the freedom change the situation
And fuck the police, them handcuffs is irritatin'
Just wonder what my mom gon' say
When they lock me up and send me miles aways, had to take it day to day
Make you express and share relates
Catchin' cases and catchin' fades
I was in the County makin' plays
You was in the Country duckin' fades
I got a stripe and took it as a live learn lesson
They let me out of jail I was two steppin'

[Hook]

[Outro: Natasha Mosley]
It's alright and it's okay
459 we roll this way
East side, West side Bompton gang
We still function we don't care

Understand my hustle
Nothin' but a G thang baby
It's nothin' but a G thang baby

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
When I be in the shower, she know that I leave it alone
So for at least a half an hour, she be tryna break into my phone, oh
I don't know what I did to make her feel insecure
But she gon' have to trust me, cause I ain't even doing no wrong

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
She won't ever get them four digits
No she won't ever get them four digits
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She won't ever get them four digits

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
She so damn nosy, don't know why she be listening to her friends
That's probably why she on me, cause they niggas be cheating on them
She just wanna be up in my photos
She just wanna be up in my videos
She just wanna be up in my emails and my DM's

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]

[Overlapping: Fabulous]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my code to keep
If I should die before I wake
I hope this girl don't crack my bank
Face down, bring her off

[Verse 3: Fabulous]
What's crackin' baby, other than my code
Just came off the motherfuckin' road
Already it's another episode
I think shawty undercover on the low
You know I be on the phone talkin' real late to 'em
She be walkin' real late on me, getting straight to 'em
I be like "okay baby stay calm, it's just Jake from State Farm"
On the real, what you searching for?
The thought upsets you, seeing that I hurt you more
I'm out the game but you know that I gotta keep it player
Every night I say a prayer, she won't ever get the four digits

[Hook: Eric Bellinger] (x2)[Hook: TC4800]
Bitch nigga you corny
Ridin' round in the 4g'z
You ain't even got four G's
You ain't even know four G's
My Louboutin's cost four G's
Bitch nigga you the police
And I don't fuck with the police
Ridin' round in the 4g's with four 4g'z

[Verse 1: TC4800]
Aye it's T.C. the lok, got money got weed
Got pro-methazine and a lot of Robin Jeans
I stay fly my nigga, I do this shit on the daily
You stay broke my nigga, you do that shit on the daily
I woke up thought being broke was boring
So I robbed a couple houses in Torrance
Cashed out, on a foreign
Pull up to any bitch I'm scoring
Uh you know I stay with them fly kicks
You know I stay with a fly bitch
And you can try to bag her
But every time you do she be like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: E-40]
Zappboard beneath the ashtray, woofers in the back
Water in the duals make loud glass pack
Sogliano tippy toes twenty-fours chrome
Bought a set of pirelli's and left the stickers on
Skipping down ave with the beat on blam
Sounding like a motherfucking summer jam
Fat bank roll, my pockets pregnant
Both of them twins, they need a c-section
My Feddi lengthy like 40 career, hustlin'
Granddaddy purp in the air, hovering
Zoning like a motherfucker, high as a quail
Bluntpower spray to get rid of the smell

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Four G's two bottles at Greystone
Smoking, getting my drink on
Threw four G's on your baby momma
Secret Sunday's now she at the My Cabana
Four G's for the bill at Katana
Thousand tip for the waitress I'm a baller
Shot caller, 64 Impala
Don dadda, me and Ace Obama
Faded at the Grammy's with the G-pen
Dolla sign kush, I'm reeking
Yeah I smell like Kesha
You niggas corny, like tortillas

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Charley Hood]
I'm on my bullshit spitting like two clip
Got your bitch on my pool table doing splits
How them niggas acting? Spoiled like they trapping
I'm from 10-4 street none of that happening
Me and my niggas, burnt out
All fly shit, all ru'd out
Talking reckless? Nigga outside your mouth
Gone ahead and get you pistol whipped like bloom bloow
No tough talk you ain't got no rap sheet
Y'all niggas ain't really had no beef
Y'all niggas ain't really clap no heat
Stop cuffing yo bitch nigga come approach me!

[Hook][Intro: Trey Songz & Kid Ink]
She doin' it wrong
Egh!

She just fuckin' with a young, rich nigga
Tell that boy stop acting like a bitch nigga

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You should get some money, why you bullshittin'?

You could bet that, check my stats

Same old clubs and the same bitches you just met
Nigga I ain't got time
If the bezel ain't diamonds, presi Obama
Pool in the Bahamas, black ferragamo
Need me some condoms, we fuckin' up commas, honest
Right now this rap shit is crackin' for me
If it didn't work out we'd be back to the streets
See life is a bitch crazier than Kelis
But I'm picturing money, my nigga say cheese
Feel fresh like Axe on me
Nah y'ain't gotta put up no act for me
Your girlfriend already said you act so cheap

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I'm about mine, tell me is you 'bout yours?
Yeah she say I'm a dog but she down on all fours
Yeah she down on the floor cause there's money all over
Then back on the pole with it
Now I got time, cause now I got change
Shit the cup got drank and we 'bout to get high girl
What did you think?
I say God to your dress but no you ain't no saint
Shit

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
You know you coming to the crib girl ain't cha
You drinking all this liquor girl ain't cha
I'm feeling on your booty girl ain't I

So bust it for me, elbows on your knees
We don't care who's lookin', Mustard on the beat

Oops, I mean deliver like the post man
Get it girl, pop that pussy like a Coke can

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Ain't nothing like, ain't nothing like
Ain't nothing like that new pussy
Ain't nothing like, ain't nothing like
Ain't nothing like hot new pussy
Ain't nothing like that new pussy
Every other night I'm in a new city
Ain't nothing like that new pussy
Many hoes don't know what to do with me

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
That's my old thot, I ran into her
Wearing loafers with the no socks, back around the grow spot
I asked her is her number the same
Cause your friend Kim heard me say she wanted to hang
Ain't shit that you can stay that's gonna stop my reign
Took a trip to Madagascar to cop my chain
All the bitches call me papi but that's not my name
Say the pussy pretty good but it's not that flame
I'm eating grilled swordfish with my Florida bitch
Caught it with my own hands so she know I'm the shit
I throw some dollars in her purse when she low on the rent
But I've gotta leave her home when I go on a trip because

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Too $hort, last night I had two of em
Fake players don't know what to do with em
You probably fall in love
Players like me, we just do what it does
Every day I'm like "damn, that's it"
I love her, then I can't stand that bitch
Is it the life of a rap star?
Way back when I was broke and didn't have a car
I still burnt rubber on that pretty ass
I caught her acting fast and I smashed
Next thing you know, we making fuck faces
I hit it real good, then I upgraded, bitch

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]

[Verse 3: Chuck Inglish]
On the low that's the truth like a motherfu-
And her, and her girlfriend bad as a motherfu-
On the phone, running zones with my lil cousin
Pull up in a 'Stang like Kane, who you looking for?
Had a couple of em with her, had to scoop a buck
Blunt's too hot, I'm like "take it off"
2x2x4, I could do it all
Sixteen of em and they're bad, gotta make a call
Cop cars, I am not the law
And I'm 'bout to touch down and get the extra point
Now I'm 'bout to take off and make another hunnid
Hit the strip club with the team for a couple of em

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks](DJ Drama intro w/ Jeezy ad-libs)
When we well and gone, please enjoy the legacy
(it's all the same, it's all the same)
And remember, we envisioned this from the beginning
(Yeah... yeah what, yeah what, what... ha

[Hook]
It's all the same, it's all the same
All you rappers got work
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody did dirt
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody whip work (raise the generation)
It's all the same, it's all the same
All these bitches gon talk

[Bridge:]
If you hit one club you ran through them all
Brought her girlfriends I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same 'caine
A hundred of you niggas is saying the same thing

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Bitch nigga where the bricks at
Put 'em in the hood so they can flip that
I don't know if you heard who fucked up
I'm supposed to be here you lost cut
When the shit come on it goes silly
You fucking round Mr. put on for my city
Mr. 1800 motherfucker broke nigga pound
Fuck this sucker duck ass nigga that did it for the town
Mr. just bought another ho, 10 go down
Just to reassure me I gon see no clown
I never ever think I'm too rich for this shit
Got that 40 cal on me 2 clips for this bitch

[Bridge:]
If you hit one club you ran through them all
Brought her girlfriends I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same 'caine
A hundred of you niggas is saying the same thing

[Hook]

(In about 3 seconds E-40 will begin to speak)

[Verse 2: E-40]
They say the game's the same but the players change
But the players change and the game done changed
Ain't nothing changed about me but my chain
My paper, my crib, my fame
Everybody sound the same except us but we don't give a fuck
Man toss that lame a stool so he can step it up
Man this soft ass sucka ain't cool bruh, no good luck
You know when they act a fool and when they cut up
My money long like Cher hair I'm everywhere like air
I'm out here with the hot pants where they don't play fair
Got hella nicknames like weed strains
Just spark a swisher and get high as Dubai cranes

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
If you hit one club you ran through them all
Brought her girlfriends I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same 'caine
A hundred of you niggas is saying the same thing

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Every year since I got here they'd thought it'd be their year
And then it's all the same.... Still at it[Hook: Tyga]
On this baking soda
Drop a four in the pot, make an ounce to a rock
Put it to your lip
On this boiling water, Heavy on the block
Hit the strips, set up shops, Stayed with a Glock
On this Arm & Hammer
Chopper with a bandana, make a nigga ass shake, Grip handle
All my shit crack nigga, crack nigga
All my shit crack nigga, crack nigga

[Verse 1: Plies]
All I need is baking soda
And the fork, and a scale
Now let's hope that these niggas don't tell
All I need a bad bitch
Who will suck me on the road
So I don't fall asleep driving with the dope
I'mma tell you what I don't need
And that's some nigga in my business
When I go to cop i don't take them with me
That's a lesson that I did learn
And the crackers get behind you
Don't you turn off, nigga they will pull you
One thing that I do know, if they ask
And they search you and your car
You better tell them "hell no!"
If my lawyer ain't with me, Motherfucker ain't talking
I got a motherfucking pistol in my pocket
If I get another quaalude
She will love me in the morning
This Liquor got me feeling like I'm Tony
Take a look at the bad guy
Motherfucker don't want that
I ain't never crossed a nigger who didn't have it coming
I swear!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Plies]
You gotta to watch a nigga out here
They put cut on the otta
We done sold you something that won't turn over
Hit y'all with a flim flam
He went and fuck up your cash
Now you're looking for a nigga with your mask
And the games that I don't play
Took a loss in a minute
Nigga trapping a nigga ass, gotta feel it
I ain't spared nobody, nobody
I ain't spared nobody, nobody
Keep a head on the swivellater
Shit is got real creep
Everybody out here tryna eat
The Young nigga wylin' at em'
See, I'm wylin' right with em'
When it come to the cash I feel them
I ain't taking no loses
Everything gotta count
Breaking mine all down to the ounce
All I need is a big lick, big chain
Big bank, this year all i'm doing is big things

[Hook x2][Hook: Chris Brown]
Man, don't play with the pussy like a banjo
Man, don't play with the pussy like a banjo
Man, don't play with the pussy like a banjo
And all the hoes in the party hit the dance floor

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Pull up, nigga creeping
Colder than a motherfucker
Guess it's ho season (bitch)
Shorty got that ass, baby girl it's nice to meet you
With these lights off, give a fuck about your features
I'm tryna fuck
If it's one on one gimme that ISO
But if it's two of ya'll I'ma let the dice roll
It's the weekend, I could tell you been freaking
Cause you popping Miley Cyrus and you twerking with your eyes closed
Go figure, skinny nigga with a suit on
Bunch of bad bitches
Yeah, they like me nigga, who don't?
Drop top, everything
We party like the roof gone
A nigga got a problem, blaka-blaka, then we move on (blap)
Tell 'em hold that
If you looking for liquor, better lick up
My liquor zing and you know that
Bitches looking for a sponsorship, cha-ching, cause I sponsor shit
Bitch I throw racks
Fucked up, got me dancing on the floor
Tryna dance in that pussy, tell me when to go
I'm tore up, feeling like I'm 'bout to throw up
One night with me this bitch about to blow up

[Hook: Chris Brown x2]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ain't shit but model bitches over here
I'm a nigga with money bitch
Let's make that clear
You here with a Elf ear
Hoes in stock over here
And the price going up by the year
It's a good year, baby
On my blimp shit
You too defensive and sensitive
That's on some mental shit
No sense in lingering
Can't count on you niggas man, only count Benjamins
He my closest friend
My wrist's a risk
Ice the bitch
Like it's sprained and shit
I'm the nigga, nigga
Yes he is, the flyest with three yes' is
I take that pussy and ransom it (now give it some date)
When I hit the block, better have your banger
That‚Äôs my babe, she don‚Äôt talk to strangers
She fold it close, we ain't gon' ever hang
Beat the box like manana-bing, manana-bang-bang

[Hook: Chris Brown x2]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
She was bomb but she wanted me to pay for it
Alley-oop bitch, you know a nigga play whores
I play with pussy, girl you know that I'm a playboy
Clap, clap, clap then she make that booty make noise
Man, she make that ass wobble like a monster
Twerk something, hurt something
Damn, I'ma need a doctor
A bitch with some real hair straight up out the projects
And she turn her phone off from all them niggas she be dodging
She ain‚Äôt loyal, I brought her head
She don't give a fuck about nothing but her bread
But when I dance in that pussy do the running man
While all these other niggas fucking with Juwanna Man
I'm throwing all of this money and I'm advancing these strippers
I got my hand on the pussy she got her hand on my zipper
She started going to work my shit got hard as a missile
Then she said she had a twin, I started fucking her sister

[Hook: Chris Brown][Intro: DeJ Loaf]
You ain't got no whip, you ain't got no bottle
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
You ain't got no cash, you ain't got no dollas
You stay with that drama, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, just keep it real with ya
You the only nigga here feeling yourself
Walk in, them bitches start filming
They sittin' with a man, thotty ass still grinning, it's on
Honest, so hot, mind on a comet
Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic
I don't give a fuck, bitch with or without a condom
Fat Joe, pockets lean back like a recliner
I'm in this, representing West Side
Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Batgang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin'
Sippin' P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants
On the real

[Pre-Hook: Kid Ink]
You could call anyone you want
I'ma kill 'em all, bet on it
Said we the only ones that stuntin' now
Let's just be real

[Hook: DeJ Loaf & Kid Ink]
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Yeah let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, we all know the deal
So let's just be honest, let's just be real

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Uh, slow down babe
It's enough, to go round back
Been drinkin' like you thirsty
How you make it to my section in the first place
Nah, I ain't trippin', shit is nada
They say it ain't trickin' if you got it
Bitch I'm a boss like Gotti
Rock Tom Ford and I still pop Molly
Roll up good Cali, la di da di
It's just me and all my hommies
At your door like the shining, egh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga
And the bitch that I'm with know she hot stuff
Pull up in the hot wheels, ballin' get yo hops up
If you got a problem get a hotline
9-1-1 but we don't ever call the cops, for real

[Pre-Hook & Hook][Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
It's like fucking four girls on the 4th of July
South central niggas ain't never told you lies
I make 'em choose sides, OpM 'til I die
Fucking with that westside, nigga bump that TeefLii
Seat is on recline, I told her: "say what's on your mind"
She calling nigga daddy, I'm finna turn 29
Know that's that balling shit
I'm on some "take-my-number-down-but-don't-call-it" shit
On my EML, alcoholic shit
Fuck that Ciroc I told her shake it for some beer
Her nigga disappeared when I whispered in her ear
Been fucking her for years but never took her to the pier
Fuck it, I might just buy her car every year

[Bridge: TeeFLii]
The turn up is real over here, oh yeah
You ain't never felt like this, like this
We can see eachother in the mirror
In the mirror girl, girl
I can see that you been practicing
On the way you move your body
Body, you're naughty

[Hook: TeeFLii]
Annie your bodies calling for me
Annie your bodies calling for me
If you want me, Annie let me know

You better know, better know
Beg you to know, better know
You better know my sex game is real Annie
Yeah, you better know
Better know, better know
Better know my sex game is real Annie

[Verse 2: TeeFLii]
Smoking with you Annie
You fucks with me the long way
You know that ain't no time for games

And I'm gonna beat it up
Annie your bodies calling for me

[Hook][Verse 1]
Nigga, I'm from Bompton
Talking that shit nigga get yo' ass boobopped-like-boowop
Pop-pop, that's two shots
My shooters in the hood going ham, they need to woosa
Niggas ain't beefing with a hamburger
I'm on Rosecrans nigga at Tam's Burgers
I'm buying AK's and handguns
Do the enemies foul, nigga; and-1
I'm really with the shit though
I'm really on the block with a pistol
Let it blow like a whistle
Yo' mom's looking like she do crystal
I'm a hundred rack boy
But daddy is a bitch and you a son of that boy

[Hook]
Nigga I'm from Bompton
That's why yo' bitch wanna fuck
And yo' homies don't like me cause they know where I'm from
Nigga I'm from Bompton
I be really in the hood though
Mama never understood though
Nigga I'm from Bompton
New shit dropping, whip copping, nigga I'm popping
Nigga I'm from Bompton
Where the Crips say, "errrb"
And the bitch niggas get on my nerves

[Verse 2]
I'm buying choppers like tennis shoes
And I hate doing interviews
Cause criminals don't like talking
I don't go to funerals, I don't like coffins
You wasn't catching fades in the county
Niggas told you "roll it up" and you was outi
I got Crips they be TG'd up
I heard you hit the county and be PC‚Äôd up
Your bitch fuck me cause I'm poppin'
I be on the block when the police watching
And if you cross the street, there's a store there
But that's the enemy store we don't go there
Nigga I'm from Bompton
I know ese's and all my enemies bitches wanna sex me
All my YG's give it up, enemies hit 'em up
West side Tree Top gang, we don't give a fuck

[Hook]
