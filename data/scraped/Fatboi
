Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President got em in the White House naked
Look at the clock and it say right now
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panatela dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack; shades on, hat back
Bugatti matte black; where they do that at
South Beach Miami, ho; I'm probably with Tammy Toe
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want the panty hoes and I’m higher than Geronimo
And I got them tools, tell them boys to get mechanical
Now pop that pussy like a fo'-fo'
I turn her round and bend her over like a low-blow
It’s Young Money baby, we the fucking greatest
We done put them other niggas on a hiatus
Beat ya bitch with a pump if she denied data
Cause I’ll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I’ll make my girl cum first then I’ll arrive later
I shake ya pussies up, I'm a vibrator
Keep getting money, like hell yeah
This shit's so good, it don’t even smell bad
And you can tell dad that I’m motherfucker
You niggas best not slip, ice road truckers
Lightpole barrel, chopper stupid long
New Orleans nigga, I get Superdome
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me
We on nigga, let them hoes know
Young Money, lay em down like old folks
You coming with it; we coming for it
Plenty to go around; now watch the money orbit
Real shit people, now just absorb it
I try to pay attention but y'all mad boring
And I got so much swag I need an ad for it
And I don’t like to brag, so my bitches brag for me
Oh she a good girl; I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it global warming
If we don't do it dog, let's do it now
I am more animal then the zoo allowed
Put me in the wild, I’ll be there for a while
You niggas little league, call em Curaçao
Energizer money it keep going
I’m laid up, I’m free throwing
Who rebounding, who gives a shit
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your misses
You are local news, I’m 60 Minutes
I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office, guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses, keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F. Baby, the F is for forensics
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
Okay you're doing your thing, but things change
You plain Jane, I’m diverse
I save the world second and I get high first
I’m a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like grandma pussy
I’m always good, like Grandma cookies
Yeah call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It's going down like the Catalina wine mixer
She going down like the hands on my time ticker
I’m always strapped; Vietnam, nigga
We are fine nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes I got a million flows
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes
Young Money baby, and the building grows
As we look up, where did the ceilings go[Hook]
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it
Living life high, everyday clique wasted
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanking
Wake in the morning, 10 o'clock drinking
"Party, party, party!" Let's all get wasted
Shake it for me, baby girl. Do it butt-naked
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted
Tell the bartender send me 20 more cases

[Verse 1 - Gucci]
Geeking like Whitney, geeking like Britney
Gucci no hippie but he stoned like Jimi
X-pill poppers, geeked up crazy
Whole clique rolling, everyone's wasted
Purple Codeine Sprite pink: don't waste it
Mix-up, grandma drink it, didn't taste it
Now grandma sipping syrup, leaning wasted
Walking around fucked up twisting her fingers
Homegirl slipped up, drunk, got wasted
Now she backstage and she trying to get famous
See me, I'm a drinkie, drinking, Gucci Mane shake it
Club life, damn right, Gucci Mane wasted

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Plies]
I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck this Almond Joy
Say she got to stop sucking cause her jaws sore
Got a bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor
Your partner just popped another one, now he rolling more
Was on 3 pills, now he on 4
I don't know why, but that Remy turn me into a whore
Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got that 40 on my waist and it's off safety
About 40 goons with me and we all wasted
On Remy straight tonight, dogg, no chaser

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Gucci]
Whole click faded, we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelets, we "white-boy wasted"
No shirts, fuck it! Our necks and arms are tatted
We sloppy drunk, disgusted, the liquor keep wasting
2-8-5 Eastside, me and Plies wasted
Racing, Chevy beating, booty/butt chasing
Spring bling, 50 thousand, white girls shaking
Some dancing naked, but everyone's wasted
Magic City Monday, ball-player wasted
This is for your uncle drinking Thunderbird, wasted
12-pack wasted, I need more cases
And Gucci's not a racist: all my diamonds caucasian

[Outro]
This is GPSA (Ghetto Public Service Announcement)
We don't get fucked up no more
We get wasted[Hook- Bobby V]
I wanna do you at yo Mama house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing

[Verse 1 - Nicki Minaj]

You can tug on my Giuseppes and my Bagley Mischkas

Now lets go, Mexico that's where we next to go
Do him like his momma make him eat his vegetables
Can call me a stage mom, boy you best to blow
Or you can even call me Wanda cause I'm "ret ta go"
You know I'm spoiled little daddy, stomps the floor
We can do it on Fifth Ave in the Department store
We can do it in Tokyo, we do it in Taiwan
All my Harajuku girls say I am they icon

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Don't compare me to your X-man, baby he a local joker
I'll take you to six-flags and drill you on the roller coaster
Call your girlfriends over, we can have a sleepover
Buy your ass a Jeep so I can fuck you in your Range Rover
Pictures in the nude, on the cruise, we gonna make the news
Sex great, sex tape, ready for a Youtube
Damn, it turn me on we do it in your momma home
Father long gone but Gucci be you daddy baby
I can fly you anywhere. We can sex in crazy places
Airport, train stations, going up the escalator
At the Dome, on the 50 I'mma throw it, you da center
When you hike it, Ima spike it
Girl dont act like you don't like it

[Verse 3 - Trina]
How bad you wanna do me on a scale of 1 to 10?
You like the way I bend, now you asking where I've been
If I'm doing him, now you starting that again?
I dont wanna sex ya friend. He don't got enough to lend
Plus he was doing Lynn and she ain't nothing like amazing
Her stuff run deep and he don't have a occupation
I'm known across the nation, Trina's that chick
Bow-legged, red bone, long hair, real thick
Do me at my mama house? No, I don't think so
I got too much class, but you can try San Pedro
I need the biggest mansion, ocean backyard
With the newest Maybach and inside a black card

[Bobby V]
Tonight, I'll touch you in ya favorite spot (oh yeah)
Promise to get ya body so hot (we can do it anywhere)
So baby, don't be scared, if they see us baby I don't care
We can do it in the Gucci store
Close down the mall girl you just don't know
In front of the police, in front of your daddy, girl it's you and me
And I don't give a damn that's why they call me Bobby V[Intro]
White girl, white girl, shy girl, shy girl

She can get you knocked out with a point of a finger
And she don’t talk to strangers, she got red tangas
Got coke in the strainer and a lawyer retainer
So you hard so you soft, she got all kinds of angles
And this California kush it got me talking like I'm Tony (Montana)
Playing with my money then I’m calling my attorney
And them people can’t believe that Gucci man got jungle fever
And I think I love this girl because her price is hella cheaper
And like lu said it’s better to loose a love than love a leaver
Running around town with them choppers about the same size as Justin Bieber

If them white girls you like, bet I got one of your type
Have a blunt for the day, brunette for the night
She got my pockets eight I bring her out in the light
I got the crowd I got them

Audemar P, tell 'em order more drinks

I'm gettin' to the Benjis I be puttin' it in her kidney
Addicted to the money smokin' loud from my prescription
Look at my position man I started off local
Now I got my own shows and I don't need a fuckin' co-host
I'm a logo ho I got logos all over me
Photos of me posin' like Jodeci, poetry
Me and two girls man you know it's like floetry
I tell 'em hoes goodnight go to sleep
Forty deep forty day forty nights
Sippin' dirty sprite
Married to the game that's my prototype
My polo white my four door white white rims
Lookin' like Casper
I'm the man bitch you can be the man after
I provide jobs like a contractor
One button make the car back up
See I'm a syrup sippin' animal, emcee cannibal
All I spit is gasoline, all my verses flammable (ugh!)

[Hook]

I be going -- I be going hard
I'm from GA just to state the odds
PSA -- public service announcement

You don't grind you don't eat check the logo
Duffel bag full of cash I'm hard like a porno
My sweater come from Polo
Sweat her that's a no-no
And no I'm not from D.C. but bitch you gotta go-go
I'm hard on 'em no homo
Pause -- smoke fo', pause -- smoke mo' I need to take a photo
Cam-er-a ready when I walk out the front do'
Last name respect first name utmost

[Hook][Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm obnoxious, I'm flowing crazy, I need to stop this
Don't knock this, you niggas lazy ya'll need to watch this
Preposterous if you can fathom how you can block this
My phantom was seen on Candler, you ride the transit
No options you niggas can't act like ya'll forgot this
I'm tired but switch ya flow up, it's so monotonous
It's my metropolis, I'll drop a 12 on ya so colossus
My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip
I'm the nigga upload your twitter, bitch I'm the topic
Profess it but Gucci didn't graduate from college
Your girlfriend says my ear rings are erotic
My lambo doors open upward they're robotic
It's Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (gucci)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Drop beam, off set things, color ice cream
White dreams, she can fuck me, that's a pipe dream
X-O, poppin' x-pills so exciting
My ex chick and ex homeboy uninvited
Cases of Ace of Spade, bitch getcha wasted
The waitress, I made her reload it like the Matrix
I lean laid with a bad bitch Black and Asian
On 20, headed to Buckhead, I'm racing baby
But take that fake jewelry off, that shit is fugazi
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken
Real and you niggas really really good at fakin'
So trill, I'mma keep it real, I'm back to the basics

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Heads up, my partner stashin' bricks up on his roof top
Whole key, half a key, quarter key
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin' juke box
Pop-pop hear the Glock cock, and I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic and a shank that shape like Tennessee (ugh!)
I cut ya, I cut ya to the white meat
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat
I smoke the best, I get my dro from California
Get high and go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma
But these niggas ain't got no heart not even if they had a donor
I roam the streets, so who the fuck is you?
Southside, Collipark, king of the jungle
My name is Ludacris, living in Atlanta zoo

Ain't me her man can't be what her man can't be
My jewelery game fridgy- white watch blizzard
Crocodile lizzard pinky ring ignorant;
I'm careful who I step to when I step too
And if I choose first she choose me then she special
Long walks all night dawg I can help her bless her
Show her how to be successful kiss her Gucci hustler
Sudden valley cook up second of the extra
Stack up loud pack make her catch a contact
Dumb sets long stacks, I can make her come back

Just let me be your only choice no need for plan B!
My love life is malnutritions you my vitamin C-
Stay down like hillary andIcan be your Billy
I'll buy you Jada pinky pinkies I'm the biggest willy
Just when I give it throw it back just like we playing
Frisbee I can do it by myself but i'd be very lonely
Be the diva who's my lover and my closest homie
So if you sick and tired of being sick and tired call me
Pick up the yellow pages and look up Gucci ! ( gucci! )

HOLIDAY SEASON!

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
? ain't a thang, call me Gucci Mane
I got these bitches taking pictures of my candy chain
I'm just a rich, wealthy nigga, kind of weird and strange
But I stay dead fly like a private plane
If you don't know about the ki, then I must explain
Everything that I got, owe it to cocaine
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussein
I'm fire: propane, I'm a boiling flame
I came, I conquered, I did my thang
Dropped my chain, then I changed the game
Two dames on the train, got that English brain
Cause my money real long like a modern train

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Gucci Guwop up in the drop playing 2Pac
Taking 2 shots of Ciroc, then drop some ?
Taking me some blocks off the top, I gotta re-rock
42 grand in my pants, now that's a Teton
The hustler don't stop on my block
They sell sheet rock
Kick you square dead in your ass until you kick rocks
Gram after gram, yes I am, I got a weed spot
Last couple days it been hotter than a teapot
Way to make bills off the deal, I got the fig out
Niggas got mills on the deal, I pulled the Sig out
Half of a bill off this shit, then I'm a nigga
Count all my money with my chain, then we gon pig

[Hook]
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane]
It's the crazy Mane with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
I dunn camouflaged the flow so it's pure ?
Got a deal for the labor, so it's more to gain
I am so untame, y'all niggas are lame
Treat your bitches like a whore, treat em all the same
You gon take her to the store, by the bitch a ring
She gon beg me for some more, want a catchy drank
60 grand in my pocket, that's a drop-top Stang
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?
I'mma shave it off the top, get some extra caine
If you ain't getting money, you should be ashamed![Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Go! If it’s a coke drought, then why's your wifey coked out?
Butt-naked, snortin’ lines in the dope house
I’m too far, smoking cigars in the dining room
Got birds everywhere, that’s why it’s called the dining room
300 pounds wrapped tight, I need every room
And move the clothes, I put the money in the closet, fool
I'm not a handyman, but Gucci keeps a lot of tools
I teach niggas how to cut it, like it’s barber's school
Wait a minute, just be patient, I may take a minute
I’m in a dark and tinted Mercedes, it cost a pretty penny
I’m in the kitchen and I’m water-whippin
I hit it for the freak, ‘cause homey bought a half a chicken

[Hook:]
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm in my Phantom with my madam and a fat blunt
I dump the ashes in an empty cup of grape fruitpunch
I'm having fun, prima donna
Sellin’ pills and chron’
I need it by the ton
I want it wit a grape one
Me and Rock from the block, that’s a great bond
I'm in the Zone 6, I'm coolin' with my black gun
True religion, .50 is my true religion
And there ain’t no robbin’ me
.50 in my robbin’ jeans
Ain't no "I" in team
You want 1017
You know my regime
Got money, all means
I bring it to you clean, I bring it to you raw
I got a 100 things, I'm tryin’ to numb your jaw

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Hey, R-O-C the Don, I'm flyer than an owl
Who that say they got new falcons? I’m passing out right now
I quote my mouth when I talk. These niggas scary
Repeat whatever they hear, these niggas parrots
Eyes of despair, I can’t spare it
Has to get my coach
That’s why I ?rode the vultures
D.E.E
I’m a pescetarian, I don’t eat beef
Go google that word
My favorite food is birds
They tryin’ to get the formula
But I’m on to them
They know I got them 5 birds, and they wantin’ them
The Pontiacs, where the fuck I'mma put this money at?
Look, now I got 30 from ?sealings this year, 100 mill

[Hook:][Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got lots of bricks, cops can't stop the shit
Fall off in the club just to stand on top of shit
Partner in the pen and he still got bales of it
I got a bale of it cuz I like the smell of it
Man I just reek of it, and I could see the shit
Say I'm conceited bitch, bitch man I need a bitch
When the rent was late I had to get the shit
I might of missed the shit I might just hit your trick
Hit in the head you bitch for what you said you bitch
Go get your dad you trick go suck your daddy's dick
Way above average bitch so can't fuck an average bitch
I break up marriages no horse and carriages
Fresh as a sparrow ho my watch named Lil Darryl, ho
Say that you are what you smoke that make you regular ho
My pack is so bougie it got me thinking I'm better than you
Pints of that medicine fool that's what they making it for

[Hook:Gucci Mane]
I got Drinkers in my family
Couple smokers in my family
Gang bangers in my family

I got smokers in my family
A lot of drinkers
A couple gamblers in my family
And we smoking on that family tree

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Me and my famo rocking camo missing with that Ferragamo
And my uncle life in shambles cuz the nigga like to gamble
Say it's too cold to hold and too hot to handle
You done folded now your lights cut off and now you lighting candles
With a million I go broke you can't hide or deny
Girl you know you smoke that dope don't tell me that damn lie
And I know your uncle front that fire boy you know that boy get high
I'm mister sell you anything I can't work no 9 to 5
And when I hold this pistol on your boy don't act like you surprised
Be a cold day in hell if this nigga stay alive
If you run I hold like 20 bands and then I'mma shoot your ass like 20 times
Glock 45 stay by my side I carve your ass like a pumpkin pie

Never shed a tear for me, my momma never had a daughter
Pussy niggas scared of me, see through you like a bottled water
Gucci Manes a bottle popper, 100 bottles open up
Still slangin opium, smoking at the atruim

You a thirsty starving artist, I'm not an artist I'm an arsonist
Trappers hear my voice on it, heavy I rejoice on it
I'm Georgia's most anticipated, screaming who you want it with?
Beef you want then beef you get, murk yo friend then plead the fifth
Tear drops on my face, so I sterotype my fuckin self
I'm the last real nigga left, man its suckas everywhere
Never infiltrate my circle, how could you when you a square?
Sittin in the electric chair, life flashing in front me
Thinking back, I'm walking bare foot, hardly nothing to eat
Everyday I promised me, til they come and punish me

This is no part of the seven it's a moss it cost a mean one
Got my top back for my grandma got my beater for Aaliyah
It's me and my money and my diamonds we a trio
And no disrespect to Ne-Yo but it's Gucci Mane I'm Sosa
And my albino Testarossa bout the color of the ocean
It's Gucci Mane La Flare and my bank account is rollin

[Hook:]
I've been drinking, I've been thinking
What my life would be without you
Come too far to turn back now
Think about all the things we've been though
I'm in love with the hustle, hustle hustle
I'm in love with the hustle, hustle hustle

[Verse 1: Rocko]
I'm the big of the barb of the bus (?) chef
The C-E-O, the rapper, MC Rocko the best, I got a million hustles
I'm a doctor, I'm the lawyer, but me not no judge
I'm an accountant, me need it all, me not gone budge
Natural born hustler, yes, that we are
Live in color flow, look I'm king in my ivory
Way in way out, train a boxer, I do it all
Realtor, builder, painter, artist
Play a little softball too, come to pitching, I'm the hardest
Kick back, getting tatted up drinking
Louis XIII, throwing back shots, thinking

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Nas]
Veteran reporter, prosecutor avoid her
I never trusted the Department of Justice
Police corruption, drugs, what's the explanation
Nas a Afrocentric-Asian, roam this ghetto plantation
Under surveillance, gotta pay another bailiff
Gotta spray another Mac, ducking all these bullets hailing
It's not enough crackheads like it used to be
Unless you selling bricks, you ain't really seeing G's
Gotta bust a strip real quick, pills or lean
Get whatever from a pharmacy, it's either that or a robbery
Catching niggas shining, book his punk ass
You know the look on our faces when we want cash
Get the bank card, social withdrawal, the money gone
Before you know what hit ya'll
Women stopped selling sex, started forging checks
Niggas got their video on the Star, they mixtape on the net
Let's hustle

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Put some food on the table, everybody grab a plate
But didn't nobody cook, nobody brought to groceries
Took my homies to the water, taught 'em how to fish
Some niggas lazy, don't rather you feed 'em - I said I'm done
Blood sucking leaches, fuck 'em, I don't need 'em
Hustler niggas on it, that's the motto
H-N-O, Rocko
I already know my M-O, grind get dope
Anything ya'll (?)
With my (?) cause she plug with the boy
I know the lingo, I'm a hustler, I play with them toys
I know how to make that mail, everything stamped up
Letter A, number one, first at everything
Settle for nothing, I want better things

[Hook:]I ain't the one (x6)

You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

[Verse 1: Luda]

I'm in the streets
With my street clothes
All up in the club lookin for the freak hoes
With them dope boys
Who make the best bucks
Moving packages, like UPS trucks
Paraphernalia in my stash box
I hit a button and the Bentley makes his ass drop
Yo rims too small
Gone shoo fly
These 24's that's Ronald McDonald's shoe size
Fresh pair of J's
I brought the Mike's out
And some ammo that'll knock a nigga lights out
Choppas everywhere
Call me the butcher
I got an AK and I ain't talking Ashton Kutcher

[Hook]

When you see me in the streets

Yours is gettin cancelled
I'm the type that mix cough syrup with a Fanta
A-T-L-A-N-T-A that my resident
Jury on same color as the president (black)
2 Chainz I ain't ringing like a ringtone
Mink hat, mink coat
I'm feeling like King Kong
I ain't the one
Bitch this my theme song
Throwing blunts back and forth like ping-pong
I'm getting to the money's apostrophe
I fucked her on a pile of clothes
She a closet freak

When you see me in the streets

[Verse 3: Luda]

I got some head from this chick
She like my baritone
Her name was Tara
She said welcome to the taradome
Phantom driver head
I'm the worst
All blue body lose the top I'm papa smurf Ayee
Hit the strip club
Bring the bucks out
Same way every day like a bus route
Lone ranger, no tonto
So my nine got my back
Like Rajon Rondo
The gat is out
Pulling night duty
Always exposed
Like Ice T wife booty
Pull a double shift
I'm on my grind
Watch 80 grand swag workin overtime

Got a white girlfriend she be acting a anus
She can get you knocked out with a point of a finger
And she don’t talk to strangers, she got red tangas
Got coke in the strainer and a lawyer retainer
So you hard so you soft, she got all kinds of angles
And this California kush it got me talking like I'm Tony (Montana)
Playing with my money then I’m calling my attorney
And them people can’t believe that Gucci man got jungle fever
And I think I love this girl because her price is hella cheaper
And like lu said it’s better to loose a love than love a leaver
Running around town with them choppers about the same size as Justin Bieber

Duffle bag full of that green shit
Ain’t nothing like my white friend

Ridgecrest Apartment got you screaming like the OG

Have a blunt for the day, brunette for the night
She got my pockets eight I bring her out in the light

It's Gucci Mane excuse me, dog, I'm makin my music
For facin me a nigga fight about what a toothpick
I did six months, incident with a pool stick
They found a nigga guilty, still say I didn't do shit
Major league, minor league, was independent
I moved on shawty, Gucci handled his business
And I ain't goin back to jail, God is my witness
I'm grillin so hard it look like it's a picnic
So Icy Entertainment and Atlantic
I'm trappin in Spanish, I'm slayin them dragons nigga

I growed up crazy boy, 1980
A true trap baby bitch the dope game made me
The streets raised me, I drove my kinfolks crazy
Whether blind crippled or crazy, Gucci won't be lazy nigga

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
From start to the finish, Gucci Mane the apprentice
So every word, letter, ad-lib, every sentence
Is perfectly place period and indented
I'm trappin' in cursive and rappin' in Chinese
Down South finest, it's Gucci your highness (wow)
Crazy color diamonds they got me shinin (true)
The charts are climbin off a cut like Tyson
I'm big coupe driving but got no license
Lames talk senseless, G's you silence
And you can use peace, dog, but I use violence
I'm trappin like a house over trap house cloudy
And your stones cloudy so you're not ballin
My Down South swag got the fine hoes callin
My swag's on Northern and my grill so 'Nawlins
My Down South swag got the fine hoes callin
My swag's on Northern and my grill so 'Nawlins

Sex great, sex tape, ready for a Youtube
Damn, it turn me on we do it in your momma home
Father long gone but Gucci be you daddy baby

Bow-legged, red bone, long hair, real thick
Do me at my mama house? No, I don't think so

Hey how you doin', Ms. Lady? You so fine with it

[Ludacris]
That waist got a swivel to it
But that ass a Cali earthquake jiggle to it
She a stallion - no horseshit
You could fit that bitch's booty on a forklift
Beep! Beep! Bitch back it up
I put my balls on the table, tell her rack 'em up
Vanilla bed sheets, chocolate laid one way
Sprinkle my nuts on top — what a sundae
Whipped cream cherry on top
And when I ain't wit' her, pussy on lock
Throw away the key, it's a wrap bitch!
Large shake and a Ludacris sandwich

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
Yo, mama turned out, she so popular
You suckers can't see her with binoculars
She'll suck your pocket dry like Dracula
Her last boyfriend bought her an Acura
Don't try to get all attached to her
She an alley-cat type — that chick'll scratch you up
Like Bel Biv DeVoe said, "She's dangerous"
Her old man used to snort angel dust
So, don't be quick to judge, shorty bad as fuck
She's the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
She had a ballplayer dude but she fucked him up
He bankrupt, selling cars like an auctioner
's Gucci

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I've got a sausage for them hot cakes
And I be fuckin' while you niggas out on hot dates
You all polite and open doors for her
While every night I put that blanket on the floor for her

Because this supersize dick is their Happy Meal
So for an extra value woody
Put this Big Mac into that Quarter-Pound pussy, yes!
It's Ludacris "Mr. Slay-A-Bitch"
Unless that pussy is smelling like a Filet-O-Fish
Shoo Fly, ho! Kick the bucket
And niggas talking shit I bust 'em in their chicken nugget[Intro]
So long it feels like forever sometimes, you know
As long as you keep progressing don't worry about shit
Hey shout out to the homie Yelawolf
Slumerican wattup? The Biggest Loser

[Hook: Jelly Roll]
I've been rolling down these dirty back old roads
For so long, so long, so long, so long, so long
I left the house when I was young
And told my mamma "I'm grown", "I'm grown", "I'm grown"
I'm gone, I'm gone..


[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
It's fucked up on this side of the fence
Seen 'em die just to tryna get rich
Seen 'em die just to tryna pay rent
Man I don't make no sense
Ever since I was a younger boy
Everybody told me I was a goner lord
But I wanted more
Than selling these packs at the corner store
Switch the game up and the shits get real
Addicted to prescription pills
I'm just out here tryna get these deals
Every week another kid gets killed
Lord please don't let me start this
These kids now is so heartless
These trailers parks and appartments
But the told me home is where my heart is

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
The say white trash is a state of mind
That's all I see in the state of mine
Did what I did and I stayed alive
And It's been like this since '85
So many nights on these hopeless streets
Mamma's at the kitchen table smoking weed
Ridin' round cathin' plays on Capri's
Only things that matters here
Who's got the dope for cheap's
Late nights, prayed to god
Mamma worked hard, had two jobs
Either you trap or you rob
Only two options against all odds
That's right, fast life
Dreams turn to smoke at the end of a glass pipe
Cop's in the neighborhood with their flashlight
Mamma keep prayin' that she gets her path right

[Hook: X2]

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Like a young little misfit
Fuck the world homie
I was smoking dope by the age of ten
Life wouldn't nothin'
But an everyday hunt to catch a buzz
Because of my friends
Well 16 to 19
So I'd be up to the 19th high with no ID
Despite me that ya'll right and smiling
The boy that I played in school was so frightening
I look at kids like 13 and think "Fuck man"
Who the hell were the people around me then?
I suppose that I could've made a better choice
But better choice's requires a better option
You wanna lift? I'm shopping
Wanna ride around the block? Buddy hop in
It's a winter wonderland
Yeah round white dust from the grass
She's credit card chopping
Hey Mamma, I love you but it's only right
That I'm gonna try that shit someday
Didn't think that day would be the 3rd day
After my 15th fuckin' birthday
Could've been a hearse
Pull up at the church, pickin' me up
But the lord had mercy
But I dropped that shit then I picked up the fifth
And till this day I'm still thirsty

[Hook: X2][Verse 1 - Waka Flocka Flame]
She don't want liquor, she just want wine
She just my kind: long hair, fat behind
They say we're intertwined, we belong together
In the club throwing money up, changing weather
G's on my sweater, all I get is cheddar
Money go-getters: Waka Flocka and 2 Timez
Gucci - sup, I said to the Haitians
Waddup Luchi. Free my nigga Zoe
40K for a show. Practice what I preach
Shawty Mane that's all I know
Triple cup styrofoam's got me walking slow
I'm smoking on reefer, me Gucci and Wiz Khalifa

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Smoking on reefer, make a bitch out
And leave her. Comment trough a speaker
Grind in my 2-seater
Cause I got a fleet-a
Send em work like it ain't a leak-a
I practice what I preach-a
If you ain't got a game, I could teach ya

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
I got a murder charge now for the tracks I murdered
Like a nigga turned around, I'm going back to work
Got a smirk on my face cause I smoke the purp
Just killed your boy boy, now they doing a search
And I ain't been lame, but tame your dame
Cause you should be ashamed how she's off the chain
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussain
I got a brink of extra change of this extra 'caine
It's crazy, Dwayne just counting strange
Me and Waka Flocka Flame on a private plane
With 2 bad ass bitches, bout to run a train
Like an organ donor, baby loan the brain

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Smoking on reefer, make a bitch out
And leave her. ? speaker
Grind in my 2-seater
Cause I got a fleet-a
Send em work like it ain't a leak-a

Ay Ziggy, I told them niggas!
They wouldn't believe me though

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
It's 3:45, she pulled up to my house
Grabbed my strap, got the door with a blunt in my mouth (haha)
Say I'm bout to put this mack down, you know I'll put this mack down
And while I put this mack down, some Pac in the background
Look at me, I'm standing tall, she know how to keep it up
We just left the club, so you know we both drunk as fuck
30 min in, second wind, call it cardio
I go up and down, round and round, Super Mario!
Oh wee, oh wee, she bustin' like a uzi (uzi)
I'm ridin' the suzuki, she wet as a jacuzzi (uzi)
Call it in, code 10, get ready for the waterflow!
Number 16, "Tear It Up", yeah I told you so

[Hook: Trey Songz]
What can I say (I ain't lying) ain't no easy way to say this (yeah)
And I don't know If you can handle it
But I'm thinkin' 'bout takin' it (takin' it there)
Cause that's the only way you ain't get it (and you)
You lay around with them boy shorts on (layin' around)
And I've been thinking about it all day long (all day long shawty)
And I too don't think that I can handle it (but her)
But I think I might end up takin' it there!

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I'm thinkin' 'bout takin it, then by receiving
She can get it right back up, just give her a reason
Any given season: winter, spring, summer, fall
I came to see the show baby, gon' and make that waterfall (haha)
She know I'm the one to call, when she want that good shit
She know I'm the one to call, when she want that hood shit
Baby lookin' all good, my demeanors all hood
Left the chopper in the car, you know the handles all wood (haha)
I stepped up in the spot, smelling like a pound
Yeah you know I'm takin' that, you ain't gotta pull 'em down
You ain't gotta take 'em off for me, I'm over aggressive
Said it's 'bout to be a accident, just call progressive

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I don't know If you can handle this, know if you can handle me
First I'm gonna start right here exactly where yo man should be
I don't know if you can handle this, know If you can handle Young
If you ain't never had a real nigga, betta get you one!
Come through on some thug shit (thug shit) gotta respect it
Yeah I come through on some thug shit (thug shit) gotta accept it
She know that I'm never shy, most of the time I'm probably high
Mr. Kidnap-The-Kitty-Cat, yeah you gonna need a aliby (haha)

[Hook]

[Outro: Trey Songz]

Audemar P, tell 'em order more drinks

I'm gettin' to the Benjis I be puttin' it in her kidney
Addicted to the money smokin' loud from my prescription
Look at my position man I started off local
Now I got my own shows and I don't need a fuckin' co-host
I'm a logo ho I got logos all over me
Photos of me posin' like Jodeci, poetry
Me and two girls man you know it's like floetry
I tell 'em hoes goodnight go to sleep
Forty deep forty day forty nights
Sippin' dirty sprite
Married to the game that's my prototype
My polo white my four door white white rims
Lookin' like Casper
I'm the man bitch you can be the man after
I provide jobs like a contractor
One button make the car back up
See I'm a syrup sippin' animal, emcee cannibal
All I spit is gasoline, all my verses flammable (ugh!)

[Hook]

I be going -- I be going hard
I'm from GA just to state the odds
PSA -- public service announcement
If you ain't gettin' no money get the hell from 'round me
You don't grind you don't eat check the logo
Duffel bag full of cash I'm hard like a porno
My sweater come from Polo
Sweat her that's a no-no
And no I'm not from D.C. but bitch you gotta go-go

Pause -- smoke fo', pause -- smoke mo' I need to take a photo
Cam-er-a ready when I walk out the front do'
Last name respect first name utmost

[Hook][Hook]
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it
Living life high, everyday clique wasted
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanking
Wake in the morning, 10 o'clock drinking
"Party, party, party!" Let's all get wasted
Shake it for me, baby girl. Do it butt-naked
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted
Tell the bartender send me 20 more cases

[Verse 1 - Gucci]
Geeking like Whitney, geeking like Britney
Gucci no hippie but he stoned like Jimi
X-pill poppers, geeked up crazy
Whole clique rolling, everyone's wasted
Purple Codeine Sprite pink: don't waste it
Mix-up, grandma drink it, didn't taste it
Now grandma sipping syrup, leaning wasted
Walking around fucked up twisting her fingers
Homegirl slipped up, drunk, got wasted
Now she backstage and she trying to get famous
See me, I'm a drinkie, drinking, Gucci Mane shake it
Club life, damn right, Gucci Mane wasted

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Plies]
I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck this Almond Joy
Say she got to stop sucking cause her jaws sore
Got a bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor
Your partner just popped another one, now he rolling more
Was on 3 pills, now he on 4
I don't know why, but that Remy turn me into a whore
Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got that 40 on my waist and it's off safety
About 40 goons with me and we all wasted
On Remy straight tonight, dogg, no chaser

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Gucci]
Whole click faded, we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelets, we "white-boy wasted"
No shirts, fuck it! Our necks and arms are tatted
We sloppy drunk, disgusted, the liquor keep wasting
2-8-5 Eastside, me and Plies wasted
Racing, Chevy beating, booty/butt chasing
Spring bling, 50 thousand, white girls shaking
Some dancing naked, but everyone's wasted
Magic City Monday, ball-player wasted
This is for your uncle drinking Thunderbird, wasted
12-pack wasted, I need more cases
And Gucci's not a racist: all my diamonds caucasian

[Outro]
This is GPSA (Ghetto Public Service Announcement)
We don't get fucked up no more
We get wasted
