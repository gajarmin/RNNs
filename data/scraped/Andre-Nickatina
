I smoke chewy like a mothafuckin nut
You got a gram bag hit the zags and roll her up
Cuz a nigga like me can't fake it when I'm high
Get the Visine for the tight red eyes
Jump in the Cutlass with the niggas from the set
The blunt went out but we ain't done yet
Get another one blaze like a barbeque beef
It ain't nothin like a blunt for the funk in ya teeth
Yeah, I'm a skinny 6'5 motherfucker
If you didn't know me you would think I was a clucker
But I'm not a clucker I'm a dodger and a ducker
Come a little closer I'm a show you I'm a punch ya
And if I can't beat you I get my gun and I'm a buck you
Turn you over like a little bitch pull out my dick and I'm a fuck ya
And like a fiend for the weed I'll tweak
Four 15's in your trunk that's beat
Proper ass amps Zapco Alpine
Put the coke on the dash roll a dollar do a line
Pump RBL maybe 1,2,3
Or the funky shit by the I.M.P
Now I'm high like a motherfuckin jet
Fuck a 9 to 5 I'm a juke on the set
Slang these thangs and fuck these hoes
One line at a time goes up a nigga's nose
The shit clears my sinuses just like a shower
Indo or the thai blend it in with the powder
Now I'm chewy high with a hard ass dick
Oh there go my pager could it be a trick bitch?
Oh it's Janine, she lick my dick clean
Come right away and bring a dime bag of weed
Like a nigga that's sick caught up in the groove
Kill the pussy bust a nut and like a vet stick and move
Out of that house a quickie I know she got mad
Because I killed it and I didn't bring the weed
I did bring the weed but I left in the my Cutty
Did you really think I would smoke some dank with you dummy? (yeah)
No, Dre Dog won't die
See my nigga Cougnut nigga let's get high
He said I got the drank and you got the dank
He said my nigga Dre Dog Frisco is the place
For me to get high and you to get drunk
We smoke dope we rap and these hoes we fuck

Ooh I'm high as hell from snorting that girl
Rush Mr. Cee so I could tie me up a curl
Out that shop hoes do jock
See my Cutty is a rag I will drop top
See the freak on the block I think her name was Kim
Just stole her in the Cutty like Iceberg Slim
I said how you doin, my name is Dre Dog
You give me your number I'll give you a call
She said my hair looked proper as it blew in the wind
But I can't have her number cuz I fucked her best friend
It's a pity I'm a nigga that just don't care
Except for my dope my money and hair
Cuz everywhere I go it's the same damn song
Nigga smoke more dope than Cheech and Chong
I love to tell the truth but I'm such a good liar
The Dre Dog nigga smoke more than Richard Pryor
I'm true to the dope that I smoke no joke
Check me right now there's a gram in my coat
Cocaine blunts (what?) and hip hop tapes (what?)
Rubber car keys and ID that's fake
And rhymes do pay so my pockets do grow
I snort so much snow that they should call me Dre Blow
Cuz I don't drink beer I don't drink gin
Bust the freak hit the pussy then I try to fuck her friends
Dre Dog don't laugh ain't a damn thing funny
When niggas talk to freaks who ain't got no money
I done smoke enough blunts fool to fill my brain
Chewy boy do me raw cut cocaine
And niggas get pumped when they smell dank-a-roma
When they smell dank-a-roma then they know I'm on the corner
They offer me drank but I don't get drunk
I smoke dope I rap and these hoes I fuck[Intro]
OK.. got some for me?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once innocent and sweet
14 introduced to the street
Started from weed, big smoke outs
Before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
Now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
Introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
Plate on the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
You see the big girls do it so of
Course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blow in ya time
Let's go

[Hook]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo

[Verse 2]
Chompin and compin Supplying people with they fix
Where you fit?
Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
Not too much cuz you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat in the pack in the side
Take a couple of tubes, then its back to the block

Back to the service out the sack
Experimenting with that salt, what about that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
Papered out, always at the powder house
Day time, night time, nigga part it out
Could've been a papered-out powerhouse

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Like you and I, super high, like superfly
One more line, one more rhyme like Peruvian fine
I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? Like Boston George?
You want some more, for you and your whores?
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
And corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man, high, eight balls and quarters
They call me, placing they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the case
Before I'm sold, they take the taste
Snortin, have it, not worth affordin
Some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doing my job, connected wit the mob
Got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night(Whale calls)

(Dre Dog talking)

Hehehehe...
Oooh...
This shit is on beat....
Hehehehe...
Man...
Drop that shit boy...
Hehehehehe...
Fillmoe....
Hehehehe...
Did somebody say umm...Fillmoe?
Mista Jim Jones could ya...please drop a verse?

(Dre Dog)
Nigga it's the J to the I to the M to the J-O-N-E-S
Nigga in the flesh
Chewy boy, doobie with the buddha cess
I'm like the Lion King cause everything I see is mines
And Tommy Tuckers man they stop and fuck us like a sign
So read my mind, the situation's critical
And off that chewy man shit can get like ridicule
You think you know me? Well test your luck and try me out
And watch me treat you like a cow in a slaughterhouse
That cutty chrome, that microphone
That new Jim Jones, that indo zone
That watch that value on your dome
I'm putting beary fairy niggas in a state of shock (shock!)
And I'm a killa whale but nigga check my pimp walk
So bust that, crush that, crush that

Cuh-crack crack!
That's how that nigga's neck snap
I'm heartless like that wolverine
Deadly like that Octagon
Fillmoe to the fuckin heart
Crooked like the Pentagon
Recka! Niggas get jumped like checkers
So what's the use if fuckin Salt if I can't fuck with Pepper
So check my rep, survival tech, and hit man killa tactics
Niggas get burried faced down in silver plastic
Mothafucka, niggas get split like a wishbone
Dank or dope, bank or cope, Nigga Mista Jim Jones
The fat rat dominator, microphone terminator
Quick to break the neck of an E-40 imitator
Nigga don't front, you know I got you open
With more Raider in me than they ever had in Oakland
To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale
PLOT!

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
And I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

(Dre Dog)
Nigga check my Ike Turner way of doin things
Not out for peace, Dre Dog is out to ruin things
The most hated mothafuck in the Frisco park
And Tommy Tuckers that talk foo I watch like a hawk
So strike a pole, strike a deer when you see me bitch
And like a hound on a fox fool I'm on your scent
You fuckin skunk
Some sugar and some chocolate thai skunk (what?)
These niggas step up and get hung like a duck
Cause I'm the dirty worm hunter
The caterpillar killer
Attitude juss like a ruthless Cuban coke dealer
In Miami, nothin but the money and the power
A deadly mix at 6 foot 6 I'm sorta like a tower
Or a tanker, a mothafuckin Iraq tanker
Nigga raise up and get (dropped!) dropped (dropped!) like an anchor
The Guardian Angels lookin straight to rip right on the spot
Cause all you are are voluntary unpaid rent a cops
And I'm a factor, better yet a motherfuckin force
Now I gotta shoot you like a broke legged horse
In pain, nigga break me off beneficial
Mothafuckas praise Nino Brown and Felix Mitchell
Big bread, too mothafuckin smart for the feds
These niggas try to raise up (what you say?) but I heard (what I said)
What
You said
I'm like woof, I know foo but you don't have a clue
(Fuck you!) Nigga fuck me? NO NIGGA FUCK YOU!
Fuck them mothafuckas I don't duck them mothafuckas
I say fuck them mothafuckas I don't trust them mothafuckas
So without a doubt I'll turn it out I ain't got no time to clown
My first words are to the point-nigga lay it down
So rock me up cause I'm dope and triple beam to scale
3/11 is my birth but nigga I'm a killa whale
CAUGHT!

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces but I'd rather be a killa whale

To all you mothafuckas that juss can't tell
I'm a Pisces mothafucka[Nickatina]
Pain from a rap cat
Man you didn't know that
3 AM, man, we bumping Bobby Womack
My homie keep all his bullets hollow
That's why I smell like Salvatore Ferragamo with the diamond sparrow
A rap cat with the BOSS apparel
I put my rhymes on your block then I run it just like little Darrell
Money and dope, man, don't come for free
Man, I don't have no competition, ho, all I got is enemies
I turn around like a tornado
Rock it like a baby cradle
Call me Doctor J if you a baller and it's getting fatal
I make MC's do angel dust
Take 'em to the Bay Bridge, make 'em strip, tell 'em jump
I don't know why I get high
I'm so in love with money I keep spending 'til it runs dry
Hot like a kettle, when the pedal hit the metal
Pinocchio you know son of Gepetto, hello
Deep fried just like Friday fish
A lot a hot sauce, now we got it popping in this bitch

[Equipto]
Yeah, in anything I do I put my everything
Always feel it deep inside just like Mary J
Ha, I'm never panicing, I'm bored stiff as a mannequin
Grew up fast just like Anakin
Baby is gullible, as Alison in Wonderland
All the excuses in the world I can't understand
Cause I'm a man of these times, demand to get high
Blow big with my closest family ties
Ain't no way to intervene in my industry
Moving quicker then a centipede on enemies
One of a kind, once in a lifetime rhymes is written
It goes on, as long as time commences

[Nickatina â?? Hook]
Shit, it's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting

[Nickatina]
I'm like a Harley Davidson motorcycle, born to ride
With the force that the courts call the last Jedi
I'm like a veteran, off Excedrins
Cause I be getting headaches from these Letterman's
I asked this little freak about my rap style
She said, "It's so damn dope they might take you to trial."
I hit the weed like I'm kamikaze next to the cosmos
Chopping up shit, yeah, with Quipto and Vago
Raps like a Tommy gun, watch how the body run
Raps from the Tommy gun will make anybody run

[Equipto]
I'm bout to go in like a movie, but no stunt double so parachute me
But somehow I feel I survived on a fluke, see
I have to hit the scene, livin' out my dreams
Then I said I was sorry to DJ's and MC's
Complete to everyone who kept their ear to the street
Then my homie came through with the Al Capone Suite

Got twice as deep, don't forget, you know how low they get
Intimidating so I pose a threat
Coming like a slider, right by ya
Known to drop a rhyme in on time, and prescribing accurate alignment
The center of attention, we'll bend a agenda
To enter this rap game the number one contender
The outta sight, and dope lyrical white, and watchin' tricks fightin'
Hyping up the crowd late night, and watching Tennessee Titans
Everybody just loving because we like and
I strike in first class light fast, just like lightning

[Nickatina]
I force my rhymes in your veins like hot shot of heroin
You'll got cold turkey trying to work me
It's like a pad lock, when you in the headlock
Six in the morning and you didn't hear the Feds knock

[Nickatina â?? Hook]
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting

[Equipto]
I'm consistent, adding on statistics
Why don't we cover the spread like the bitch never existed
Phonographic rotate the plastic spinning
Living like I'm knowing it's gonna be a drastic ending
Playing classics, meditating these tactics to overcome
The show is done, anticipating to roll a blunt
Baby, getting anxious, hitting and I can't miss the focal point
When locals say, "He ain't shit."
Man it's Equipto, put it all down for my homies
And rolling my weed right next to the police
Nothing but love for all my homeboys hustling drugs
Up in your program fucking it up

[Nickatina]
I'm in the fast lane, the cash lane, some think it's a bad thing
Hitting 'em off with the C&H pure cane
I get stuck in your membrane
I'm like a pimp at a party when you say "Look at them rings."
I use a Motorola, to move this baking soda
Whether it's in Denver, man, Houston, man, or North Dakota
With no apology, tech-tech-tech technology
Some brother disin' me, or even thinkin' he
I got the soul and the spirit of the wrath of Kahn
Kick back and write just like the holy Koran

[Nickatina â?? Hook 2X]
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting[Verse 1 - Mac Dre]
Backwoods got me congested ain't rested in two days
I'm gettin' paid been on niggas head like toupees
I'm a thug cuz, rob the blood out your gaze
A cutthroat nigga, bitch, scandalous for days
From school days I blew bays got ripped and fucked up
In new jays on two ways I scritched and scratched up
I beat that batch up when I found out she lyin'
Who she think I am, saving private Ryan

[Verse 2 - Andre Nickatina]
I make ya town move just by walking on ya block
Take the keys to ya city but I still pick the lock
Buy a car and a Glock, put the cash in my socks
Flip the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock
To hell with the law, the freeway's mines
So is yo freak radios and Alpines
Coke with a little bit of cherry lemon lime
Ya think of me ya think of big money everytime
Candy coat shine like the trigger of a nine
Orca was a whale but Pisces is the sign
[Verse 3 - Mac Dre]
I got split personalities, I'm bi-polar
You might see me with my Italian stallion or my chola
Rap rock and rolla, I'm dope as yola
If you don't pimp her, I might like Dola
I'm riding in a big boat like Noah
Wid two women of each races, boy I control a
A whole ho stable I'm a mack and I'm ready
No dough ho dead it, that's right I said it

[Verse 4 - Andre Nickatina]
I grip my dollar bills like my Caddy steering wheel
I'm not a chil pill freak do what you will
Heart ticking like a time bomb eating spicy prawns
Man it's the god of Khan check it baby right or wrong
Can look but don't stare it's the crime rhyme king
Wid braids like a juvenile Khan nahmean?
Wid Bruce Springstein in my Anchor blue jeans
Oh yeh I'm in ya city man what's up with the weed
Man call all the Gs, and tell 'em all freeze
Andre Nickatina sayin' nigga what you need
Hit the corna so narrow in a fly blue Camero
A sparrow dodge a arrow but not a double barrel

[Verse 5 - Mac Dre]
We in a seven series beama it's me and Nickatina
Ready to sexual harrass a bitch like Martin did Gena
Committin' felonies and hella misdemeanours
A dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener
Rap singer, pimp done slapped Tina
I mack nina from black to latina
Clean as Noxema quick to pop the nina
Got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her
Willamina, Tina and Trina got dick by the bay on a Berkeley Marina
Don't mean to point the finger but uh
She got pancake syrup and butter

[Verse 6 - Andre Nickatina]
Man the way I smoke weed it's like death of a genius
Reappear roll up rise like a phoenix
This is not a remix, Nino Felix
Put it in a capsule seal it deal it
How you want it Nicky baby four times five
A quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pot pies
Excuse me if I'm greedy cause I'm caught up in the lust
I'd lie if you want but I'm a tiga you can trust
Cause I'm on Fillmore in a white Velour suit
In a blue Kangol, in my Wu-Tang boots
With a back like a cobra cursed by the mail
My manicured nails touch a triple beam scale
Baby is a athlete, body like a star
Ya talking real bad freak meet me by the carScottie,scottie
Scottie,scottie

(andre nickatina)
Put the phone on ya butt it's a booty call
And I'm comin' to bust nuts on all ya'll
And I'm out
Half a blunt hangin' out my mouth
Speedin' like a demon on 101 south
I smoke chewy like a muthafuckin' nut
Ya got a gram bag get the zags an' roll 'er up
It's Andre Nickatina tiger comin' out the cuts
Maximum speed drivin' I don't give a fuck
Garcia blunt fully hunt down the cat
These bitches on the street muthafucka where you at
Dippin' on swayze wit my niggas from the set
The blunt went out but we ain't done yet
Get another one blaze
Bitch get paid
I wait for that check every 15 days
I remember high school low fuel and bushy
Cuttin' that muthafucka go gettin' pussy
Caught up in the madness
This freak was the baddest
I seen her baggy jeans and her ass was the fattest
Ooh it's Jenine
She licked my dick clean
Come right away she got a twomp sack of weed
Nigga I'm sippin
My potna's got the tay' stay sippin'
Talkin about money,hoes, hustlin' and pimpin'
I'm over
Doja like this fine bitch
Shinin' like a car in my new Stan Smith's
Cut the fade
Hoes get wet from the wave
Dancin' in a cage with ass for days
It's like this
I didn't know you smoke chewy bitch
Now bring the yayo too so we can fire up a spliff
About six
My pager's talkin' to me sayin' "shit
The battery's low in this son of a bitch"
Yeah 15's pound like this
15's screamin' out bitch
15's bumpin' gangsta shit
Mind on a muthafuckin' grip
(shaggie)
A nigga grabbed his coat when I heard them 15"s
With a new 9 in the waistline of them jeans when I them 15"s
Heard them 15's
Grab my weed to get keyed when I heard them 15's
Fresh out the house about to pop my p's
My niggas done swoop me up about twelve fifteen
What's the first thing to do? Dip to find that weed
In that sedan de ville cadilac wit' the gangsta lean
I gots to pop me a knot
Soon as we hit the spot
So I can hit the ho twice and see how much cash she got
Me and 'Dre will hop out
When we hit the parking lot
And get to flossin' on them fools like I pulled up at the postop
Jumped out the car and we was feelin' like g's
I was broke that day but lookin' like I slang keys
But these hoes will never know
Cuz them ones will have you fat
When you off in one of them clubs and dressing all in black
And it was cool I had juice to get in with a strap
In case I see one of them niggas from back in the days I done jacked
In fact
My nigga shot done served that nigga a sac
And told me that he had 3 mo' niggas posted out back
Bring this on
Cuz right by the back door is my cuzin tone
And mr. blunt
Ready to give some nike reading lessons to a chump
We make them bleed
Then leave the seen
Wit them a.r. 15's
A.r. 15's
(andre nickatina)
Man I don't drink cappuccino
I'm a Pisces not a Leo
Can't even strike to Reno unless I tell my fuckin' p.o
Drinkin pina colata Boone staring hard at the moon
On the eighteenth floor of the hotel tryna find my room
Five star
Addictive like liquor at the bar
I sell tapes nigga bring it on, cash or MasterCharge?
I gets lower than a den when I'm strikin' on a mission
Lookin' for competition
Or maybe a couple bitches
My style is something deadly like a Newport cigarette
I'm a street chemist bitch
A money hungry pit
Like daffy duck I gives a fuck
It's mines it's all mines
Catch up like Heinz
Cuz I'll leave that ass behind
Come stick with me
I'll bumble like a bee
Cuz my boo
We was cool
Back in nine two
But check it
I hit the party I sees niggas hoes and weed
And my homeboys wandered in and don't wanna leave
Ya know what? I think not
Ya know we hate cops
Imagine if nigga bought
Every donut shop
In the city
Fuck it in the muthafuckin' world
Greasy like a curl
Priceless like a pearl
Strikin' like a lighter
Bitin' like a biter
Bitch did you recognize my whitewall tires?
(shaggy)
Yeah man I recognize your whitewall tires, but we got to get this over with
You understand me. I'm makin' moves I can't be standing around it might have
Been a good day for you,but I'm a tell you it'll never be right

I stepped outside and I was tweaking
So tipsy mentally geekin'
I seen my nephew he had just got plug
He gave me credit he hooked me up with a proper dubb
Here come my girl I hope she got a pipe
It might of been a good day for you, Dre but for me it'll never be right
I must have been geekin' and I stole my mama's t.v
Now my little cousin and my nephew wanna see me
But I ain't lookin' for them,I lookin' for a triple beam
And I'll be back later on cuz I heard you niggas got ice cream
Something fat never that soda
Fuckin wit the mexicans ya'll be havin' that peruvian yola
Straight butt naked a dobe fiends dream
Nextellin' ain't no tellin' when I put it on a triple beam
I love that bitch if ya know what I mean
But I ain't talkin' bout that skanless,I'm talkin bout that ice cream[Nickatina]
Situation critical cause shit ain't nothin nice
Motherfuckers play for keeps so niggas lose they life
Money comes in different ways, the dope game's kinda slow
Niggas used to havin money are lookin kinda po'
Dank or dope, there ain't no hope these niggas peelin' caps
Gangstas pullin major leagues and brag about the jack
Situation critical this chewy got me stuck
Indo calm a nigga down but keeps a nigga pumped
My partners mamas smokin rocks and turns into a ho
And since they fuck with that right nigga the gat will snort and blow
Killas move in silence and the jokers run they mouth
Fightin fools that don't exist take that nigga out
Cause his love is murder, two jack burgers takin your respect
Coke and dank sex then baked your homies in the set
So flash yo cash and whoop your ass if you've got more than me
And whatever you got is more than mine so nigga let me see
Cause jealousy's reality when it comes to niggas bread
And snitches go from rags to riches rattin' to the feds
Cause coke is queen and money is king and niggas want the crown
So all you niggas goin up you fuckers goin down
The situations critical with stories on the streets
Kill em dead and get yo bread but make sure that you eat
But I ain't done yet
The situations critical

[Nickatina]
My baby's momas trippin, got my son and I can't keep him
Wanna cry to hear him on the phone, but she won't let me see him
This chewy got me paranoid and goin kinda scared
Niggas startin to know my face so I had to cut my hair
Cause nigga, shit is gettin thick from here to Alabama
Cause every nigga's tryin ta like Tony "Face" Montana
Some niggas talk about they'll kill, but nigga no you won't
Some niggas that dream of playin hoop but end up sellin dope
Cause 3, 6, 5 like everyday man dolja takes it toll
And motherfuckas live to be a G Original
Cause kill groups, its keys the juke, and rubber band they G's
Money shows this ain't no joke, well bow down to your knees
Situation critical, fuck a 9 to 5
Chewy got these niggas amped and they ain't scared to die
So miss me with that bullshit and hit me with that bank
Miss me with that bammer bitch and rush me with that dank
Time is runnin out partna, time ain't runnin in
My freedom is the only life, so fuck the fuckin pen
So as I chew my juicy fruit and think about the dead
And all my niggas that had died because they had some bread
My mind is on another level nigga this is typical
Check my eyes I'm dyin inside, situations critical
Situations critical

[Nickatina]
Niggas dressin rich, knowin they broke without a doubt
Born and raised in the same hood in a roach infested house
Situation critical I think I'm bout to die
The enemy is creepin up and fuckin off my high
A nigga hit the 5th and makes it home in desperation
Wipe the sweat, hold my chest, and then I plot retaliation
Now before you clown you best calm down cause I read you like a book
Now must you stare cause I don't care, cause I won't even look
Thangs ain't what they used to be a motherfucka told ya
Niggas got the mind to kill and that includes the rollers
Cause 2, 4, 7 like everyday niggas servin cluckers
Beatin up the bustas, fuckin Tommy Tuckers
Some niggas say they gangstas and they love when money folds
But mosta the time these niggas be beefin over hoes
Cause pussy comes a savage beast and it also makes you broke
Especially when that sexy freak is snortin all your coke
So check my situation fool and check my state of mind
No matter how you makin paper nigga, thats a grind
My indo have an increase this week from eighth up to a half
And nothin funny motherfucka, nigga why you laugh?
So fuck this fame and fuck these records, motherfuck these raps
My mother's broke there ain't no hope, her son ain't got no snaps
Its the same old song I'm doin wrong, fool this is typical
Fuck the fuckin world mama, situations critical
Situations critical[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
Fast lane baby
Ain't nothin' like it
Some play it cool, some get excited
Hit 5th gear and you might get indited
Spend all your cash tryin' to fight it
And how ya like it

[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
The Nickatina roll dice - shoot craps
A brand new rap means a brand new gat
Some rather sit around and snitch like rats
Ain't no tellin' where I'm at on the map
My Chuck Taylor's they stay laced divine
Look in the eyes of a rap cat laced with rhyme
And its a felony
And its a drought is what they tellin' me
In my mind yo that's a penalty
Man baby so mean she wear the apple bottom jeans
90 percent cream bumpin' the 15
Night time god parlay, blucka blucka
In the mix now ya cocksucka
I never leave it alone homes I love a big bank roll
In your face freak with plain clothes
Yea fly like a kite no cops in sight
Racin' through the city runnin' every red light
Drivin' like I hate my life
God of Khan in my vein and my brain ain't no wife
Night time god parlay, blucka blucka
In the mix now ya cocksucka
You get flavour like a skittle when I rip a rhyme riddle
Your face is in the pillow then I shoot it in the middle
Yeah 26 words in the alphabet
And I use all 26 to get this grip
Cause you can see me on the highway, the plane, the plane mein
Nickatina late for his flight again
With hot weather, hot leather, and hot cheddar
You bring the beats with the hot borettas
My souls controlled by the late Billy Holiday
Meaning that I'm strung out all the way
Rainy alarm with the charm of a nickel as barm
Then I sell you somethin' to shoot straight in your arm
Then get a plate, some duct tape, somewhere to bake
Some mayonnaise jars then give a little shake
I hope you got somethin' 4 pound on your waist
Because I drive like I don't have brakes
Cause its the

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Equipto]
Uh, you see I'm cold blooded
Gary Petters gold glovin'
Lovin' to play it cool but get heated like an oven
I bogart in barge in with all fairness
Ain't no turnin' back I burn a sack so careless
Sly just like stone
High all alone, glowin'
Rap crews oblivious all outta they zone
And I was told to treat em cold
I blow, hear the beat and flow
There's no need to tell a leader go
This is a rush we outspoken in the pimps discussion
Like N.W.A I'm always into somethin'
And I'mma rep it like a athlete
Out shine stampede
Rollin' with motha fuckas just doin' the damn thing
Livin' life too fast to catch it
But got it mastered down
Now get mad and lash out
Classic genuine rappin'
Watch the boy play
Can't escape the game the range is point blank

[Verse 3: Andre Nickatina]
When it come to cash yea man some might divide it
But when it come to me don't try it
God of Khan
Playboys ride toys on chrome
Baby you drunk, you need to go home
15 crankin out thug rug bone, first of the month, and roll another blunt
Tonight I got cranberry juice in my cup
You starin' at a rap cat freak, what up
Night time god parlay, blucka blucka
In the mix now ya cocksucka
Put on your seat belt need help
I'm about to go fast
No pictures mothafucka so don't even ask
Forget about the past
You better do the math
Freaks tryin' to put they dirty hands on the cash
More keys than a piano
You like to travel
Think all the fours that flows with the ammo
Retreat to the shadows fire in the battle
You might see me on your favourite news channel
2, 7 or maybe even 5
Money on my mind
You see it in my eyes
Talk so much shit I don't never have to lie
Unless it's to a judge
But then I gotta grudge
A game where there ain't no love
Money, cars, strip bars, and the hardest drugs
Night time god parlay, blucka blucka
In the mix now ya cocksucka
Night time god parlay[Bricktop (from the movie Snatch)]
Goody gumdrops

[Verse 1 Andre Nickatina]
One thing I despise is virgin suicide
Shere Khan is something that the wind cries
The way I collect is like a bomb threat
Meanin if you don't have my dough
I'm a blow fa show
You better have heat when you hang with this villian
Meaning that its cold when I'm chillin
Catch the fillin
Slipped in on a banana peelin
I seen them dead on the floor with the blood's skeeted to the ceiling
I was like yo how that happen?
Chuck taylors down gotta keep on rapping
The one bullet, the right place at the right time
Can turn a hell of a wave into a flat line
My style don't pump no blood
It pump weed and gasoline, Nicky Nickitine
Man ectasy can twist yo spleen
Tell that to the freak in them jeans, know what I mean?
It's kind of ironic, make a phone call for the chronic
And let my tigers hold the gin and tonic
Man I curse so much it's blasphemy
But I do what the rap gods ask of me
Half heart, half hustle
Have heart if you dont have muscle bite a punk ear in a tussle
No love but I'm passionate, blow weed in the face of the baddest chick
Get spin like a cd, I try not to get sleepy
On the grind when it's creepy, street gods wanna teach me
Pocahantes makin money for me bustin in the tee pee
My All Star Chuck Taylors, stay laced like the mayor
Street ball court player
Rapid fire rhyme sayer
You'll be like "Nicky man no fair", real proper
I disappear like Jimmy Hoffa
Reappear on Easter
Pants in the heavy start to increase her
T shirts with the vestes feature
Miesha check it its the god of Khan
Chuck Taylor down like the Ramidan
Catch a feelin', slipped in on a banana peeling
You got a scheme homie what you dealin
Man the bad lieutenant
With the blunt wrapped dope in it
Its like Popeye with his spinach
Run around like you playing tennis
And you still ain't finished
International keep the party crackin like pistachios
The freaks got it poppin like a fashion show
Make a move with me birdy baby grap the dough
Like a linebacker
I got a gift like a blind jacker
Put a hole in your six packer
The south paw with the lock jaw
In the kitchen with the rock raw
You remind me of cocaine and doo-doo stains
Man its the shitty dope dealer
Dirty worm catapilla
Weed collide like the sun and the moon
And I'm still trippin off that room with the blood on the ceiling
Catch a fillin
My chuck taylors got me creepin
And rap dealin
Come through and leave you stunned
And in a shock
And leave my heart on the block like a lost Glock
In the bushes or woods man you do what you could
With the little you got are you cold or hot
Put it down with the plot, and got knocked
And went to jail naked in ya shoes and socks
Leave it up to ya woman man to move ya rocks
And the freak turned the spot into a hot box
Chuck Taylors All Stars and all stars
Make my way to the bar and there you are
Catch a fillin

Hey sister, give me some of that cheeseVerse 1 [Nickatina]
Man, check this out
This a four four
I don't care and I don't know
Man, Repo is lookin' for you on a car note
I hit the freeway, lap top, speedway
Don't ask my bout a bitch, I probably sold her on Ebay
My problem, the Jordans with the red bottoms
Or the Hennessy that come in the black bottle
Wing stop
Man, lemon pepper ranch style
Yeah I owe you money but I'm not paying back now
Scroll up, who got something to roll up?
Blaze the lie, in the car, Nicky Panama
I think I run a mile
I'm gonna run amok
I'm going downtown
To get my numbers up
I gotta crack the bottle
It's dark as Sleep Hollow
And the weed's the same color as a avacado
I like the Benz model, the 550S
I like to spend cash
I never make it stretch
I'm such an addict
Paypa is a bad habit
Man, I'm such a gimme gimme
Man, I'm such a gotta have it
All cabbage, no salad, no spinach
I like the ones that stay up
And get it til' it's finished
I do a brain tease
Something like a brain freeze
Cuz I gotta keep so cold
Until you know it bring cheese
Get with it
Or get lost real quick
And I'm never callin' back
Blazin' ?? in the whip

Hook:
I'm a go go getter y'all [x4] (so cold)
That ayo, like ayo (I'm so cold, nigga)
I'm a go go getter y'all [x4]
That ayo, like ayo (go getta)

Delic!

Verse 2 [Kushadelic]
Kickin' back with Nicky
Tales of these boss niggas
Rockin' with these mob figgas
Couple, ya'll some go gettas
Everybody we know hear us
Banged up and head splittas
Hearing stories from real killas
On the block with dope dealers
When we sell that crinach
But now a nigga in that
Go and get this scrinach (scratch)
Moving up the trinach
Smoking on that alpaca
Yo where them hoes at?
It's third world not your world
Delic man I am that
All I here is do do do
In the hood it's do do do
With the programs and the government plans
They fuckin' me off, I'm gettin' my loot
But I will shoot, in my suit
Creased up and cuffed up
In a bow tie but a sucka try
And he will get fucked up
Woulda got up in my cut
Hennessy not syrup
I love sipping that cognac
With hella weed ta burn up
Man, I stay so turnt up
In the club, we turnt up
I'm balling like I'm Kaepernick
With the whole click if you run up

[Hook][Verse 1 - Mac Dre]
Backwoods got me congested ain't rested in two days
I'm gettin' paid been on niggas head like toupees
I'm a thug cuz, rob the blood out your gaze
A cutthroat nigga, bitch, scandalous for days
From school days I blew bays got ripped and fucked up
In new jays on two ways I scritched and scratched up
I beat that batch up when I found out she lyin'
Who she think I am, saving private Ryan

[Verse 2 - Andre Nickatina]
I make ya town move just by walking on ya block
Take the keys to ya city but I still pick the lock
Buy a car and a Glock, put the cash in my socks
Flip the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock
To hell with the law, the freeway's mines
So is yo freak radios and Alpines
Coke with a little bit of cherry lemon lime
Ya think of me ya think of big money everytime
Candy coat shine like the trigger of a nine
Orca was a whale but Pisces is the sign
[Verse 3 - Mac Dre]
I got split personalities, I'm bi-polar
You might see me with my Italian stallion or my chola
Rap rock and rolla, I'm dope as yola
If you don't pimp her, I might like Dola
I'm riding in a big boat like Noah
Wid two women of each races, boy I control a
A whole ho stable I'm a mack and I'm ready
No dough ho dead it, that's right I said it

[Verse 4 - Andre Nickatina]
I grip my dollar bills like my Caddy steering wheel
I'm not a chil pill freak do what you will
Heart ticking like a time bomb eating spicy prawns
Man it's the god of Khan check it baby right or wrong
Can look but don't stare it's the crime rhyme king
Wid braids like a juvenile Khan nahmean?
Wid Bruce Springstein in my Anchor blue jeans
Oh yeh I'm in ya city man what's up with the weed
Man call all the Gs, and tell 'em all freeze
Andre Nickatina sayin' nigga what you need
Hit the corna so narrow in a fly blue Camero
A sparrow dodge a arrow but not a double barrel

[Verse 5 - Mac Dre]
We in a seven series beama it's me and Nickatina
Ready to sexual harrass a bitch like Martin did Gena
Committin' felonies and hella misdemeanours
A dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener
Rap singer, pimp done slapped Tina
I mack nina from black to latina
Clean as Noxema quick to pop the nina
Got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her
Willamina, Tina and Trina got dick by the bay on a Berkeley Marina
Don't mean to point the finger but uh
She got pancake syrup and butter

[Verse 6 - Andre Nickatina]
Man the way I smoke weed it's like death of a genius
Reappear roll up rise like a phoenix
This is not a remix, Nino Felix
Put it in a capsule seal it deal it
How you want it Nicky baby four times five
A quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pot pies
Excuse me if I'm greedy cause I'm caught up in the lust
I'd lie if you want but I'm a tiga you can trust
Cause I'm on Fillmore in a white Velour suit
In a blue Kangol, in my Wu-Tang boots
With a back like a cobra cursed by the mail
My manicured nails touch a triple beam scale
Baby is a athlete, body like a star
Ya talking real bad freak meet me by the carOK.. got some for me?

(San Quinn)
Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once innocent and sweet
14 introduced to the street
Started from weed, big smoke outs
Before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
Now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
Introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
Playin it on the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
You see the big girls do it so of course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blowin ya time
Let's go

(Chorus 2X)
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo

(San Quinn)
Chompin and compin kicks
Supplyin people with they fix
Where you fit?
Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
Not too much cuz you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat in the pack in the sock
Take a couple of tubes, then its back to the block
Back to the service out the sack
Experimentin with that salt, what about that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
Papered out, always at the Powder house
Day time, night time, nigga part it out
Couldn't been papered a power house

(Chorus 2X)

(San Quinn)
Like you and I, super high, like superfly
One more line, one more rhyme like Peruvian Fine
I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? like Boston George
You want some more, for you and your whores?
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
And corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man, high, eight balls and quarters
They call me, placin they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the case
Before I'm sold, they take the case
Snortin habit, not with affordin
Some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doin my job, connected wit the mob
Got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night

(Chorus 4X)

That's some good coke[Intro]
OK.. got some for me?

I got a fetish for Adidas, boss
But I betcha don't know what my Fila's cost, do ya
On chew, like dem baby pit bulls
And ain't no way you can touch my....cool
The 12th floor at the Marriot
You know, me and my tigaz chill there a lot
Fetti
I sit alone when the mic's on
With Tyson every time that the fight's on, kill 'em
I remember I used to ride with nets
Flight at the midnight high as the jets
You know Al Capone suite gonna to save the set
And I'm teflon down, t-shirt and Guess
Rhymes you can taste, rhymes, rhymes galore
Rhymes you can buy at the candy store
You know who I am, I'm like credit card scam
Hot like soul food, greens and yams
Extra-curricular, netting the particular
Hit the clouds like the mayor or the senator
Shouldn't've lied, I coulda been a good friend to ya
Now I got to get rid of ya
Get gone

[Verse 3]
I told my mom something that made her cry
Looked her in the eye and said rappers don't die
We knock on heaven's door but we don't get by
So most of us gonna be in hell hot, kickin'
Now put the rhyme on a triple beam
Now rock it up, and chop it up
And try to grind into triple cream
Don't get caught with the same scheme
Meaning don't get caught with the same things, King
It's like you got to be boss
Cause hoes and niggas wanna see you go fall
I think they laugh when I take the loss
But I'm a hyena so I got to laugh that breaks them off
The hot wax that's real fatal
Cooked up to perfection like a weapon on a turntable
They say Vetta's got a new beretta
And he'll be aiming his gat like a crooked letter, forever
I hit the night like stormy weather
And if you brag about your freak, I'mma say mine's way better
I rotate like the hands of a clock
And find ways to make my rap be part of your block
You better knock on the door tiga
And lay them all on the floor tiga
Cause I think they want more tiga
I blow 'em out like a flat tire
And hit the weed for Richard Pryor
Then call 'em all straight liars
It's worth something like the tail of a fox
So keep the streets hot 'til you know your tiga...[Woman:] Only maybe, maybe it could be different, this time. If we try
[Man:] I've never seen a guy that could get away with it yet

[Intro sample]

Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
No angels guide me, I seem to be lost
Spittin a rhyme from devious ways
All in the veins them freaks they get paid
The path was laid, the bed was set
Nicky the cat from the fillmoe 'jecks
Here go the steelo it ain't that odd
Khan, money, clothes, broads
Don't forget weed and rap for the gods
Pages that rewrite the Holy Quran
Man I've been swervin since Julius Erving
Ready to rap now so open the curtain
Don't be in the lab when I'm doin bad
Pencils and pads they turn to cash
This how I mash
Driving so fast
Shoes say WU! when I step on the gas
Baby is mad
Man she got ass
I looked and gave her my gangsta laugh
My pedigree, my legacy
I sell it like amphetamines
They told me at the dinner scene
And I'm standing there high in my anchor jeans
Gangstas, hustlers, hoes and all
Feel the pain when a rapper falls
Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
No angels guide me, I seem to be lost

[Muhammad Ali:] I'm Dancing! Follow me chump! No I'm not there, I'm here! Sucka you ain't got nothin'!

It's mighty extreme to being a king
Looking for people to be on the team
How much money it cost to cheat
To slow ya down and be drug free
With Kenneth Cole boots and Sean John suits
And execution that top of the roof
Who got the juice
Show me some proof
The curse of the rhyme give me the loot
Awake like an owl and drinkin' some tea
Watchin' fights of Muhammad Ali
Dodgin' death with every step
This is my rep, give me the checks
Like Snagglepuss I'll step to the left
With this freak, with that quiet as kept
My philosophy is the boss of me
Pass the hot sauce to me
You need diamonds and pearls to floss with me
I stand there with none
Hot as a gun
The sound of the noise will make you run
Move from the slugs that will rip your lungs
Look in the eyes of the greediest god
Rollin the streets with the Caddie Passat
Cut through the rain like ninja blades
The batter ram explain the rage
I got my game from project floors
Weed, dope, and dice by the door
Crush anything that'll cause a threat
Talk to the bookie secure the bet
Never with leniency he won't agree with me
Gettin' all mad when I make the call
Gangstas, hustlers, hoes and all
Feel the pain when a rapper falls
Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
No angels guide me, I seem to be lostAndre Nickatina - Bobble Heads (ft. Black C)

A hundred white girls in a single file
Tryin' ta get touched and they all know how
It's about to go down
I'm bout to go ham

She a movie star and I like it like that
(Shorty work her back like a bull in a China shop)
When the jakes come around, boy you know where it's at...

[Pimpton]
I come through like a UFO when it hovers
And bang Wu Tang in the shudders
Put down the nine just to hit him with the putter
The sucka never even told his mother that he loved her
Bread for the butter and pity for the fool
He should have known better than to fuck with Crown Jewels
I'm chillin' with the Killa Whale, look like Shamu
Ya head get wet and we ain't talkin' shampoo
We do like Van {? dues ?}
My favorite dance move
Is when MJ freeze tip toe down his shoes
But I ain't come to dance I'm collectin' my scrill
That's why I fucks with Nicky, trill recognize trill
Shoot for the kill
Ride round hot box, tint, Coupe de Ville

So go on catch a foot up your ass
Have your shit lookin' like "damn
I walked in got had 'fore I sat down."

I'm [fighta?] blue when I do my allstar pitchin'
You could scream in my ear and I won't listen
I don't like you bitch, you need ta quit trippin'
Do ya time playboy nigga, stop snitchin'
Man it's a sugar man, someone might say ta god
It's like Chris Paul throwin' Blake Griff a lob
Or Mac Dre tellin' hoes that it ain't his job
I let the Benz bust a bitch and I straight mob
The homie said his new gun had a rubber handle
And he'll love to blow you out like a roman candle
I stand alone in the rain like a lost lover
To reconnect with the homies like the Ward brothers
Man, it's a gold thang
And I like to pick up a little ho change
And my style stand out like a gold chain
Fillmoe in the buildin', and it's a go mayne
Khan Mecca and it really ain't no thang

I'm looking like Pac in the Benz when he was hanging out the window
Right now, I've got my Jesus piece on
And all my rings, you can see Im about the game
Holler back, baby, like an echo
But you gotta know your colors
Get green, roll purple
My tires just did a full circle in your neighborhood
And like gumbo, the flavors good
I roam like an alley cat  Grade-A, Supercat
Bumping Shabba Ranks on a full tank
My religion, baby, is big bank
Holler when you see me spending money, go amen
Snow bunnies love them a suntan
Thats why I wear my hat low and my shades, man
I don't waste time or liquor
You can see it on my face, I don't chase, it's a race

I don't know what they say where you stay
But where I stay, everybody say pay
So you'd better (break bread)
Baby it's a (go-go) when it comes to (cocoa)
Get down and do what you said (break bread)
Just like a leprechaun, looking for a jackpot
Or a hot crack spot, baby (break bread)
Baby its a (go-go) when it comes to (cocoa)
Get down and do what you said (break bread)

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
Man, this is money motivated, demonstrate it to the latest
I do it like an addict up in Vegas
And you can see me talking like a wizard through my cellular phone
Living life like a felony, weed and cologne, like
Pacific heights, crushed ice
I do it like a haggler, baby, yeah, on a Sugar Ray Leonard night
Posted up just like a poster
If youre melting like butter, baby, Imma have to toast ya
My stairway is straight Led Zeppelin
And my Air Force Ones so new and so fresh, and
Play you like a PS3
And thats Crown Royal, freak, dont try to BS me
But I never knew what she said
All up in her head with the phrase that pays, and it says:

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]

[Verse 3: Richie Rich]
Twenty fifties, a hundred tens
Two white bitches in a Batman Benz
Straight mobbing, one named Robyn
Cant see her head cause the bitch probably bobbin
Slurp something  twerk something
Bitch, you getting money? Maybe we could work something
I been had a million
I dont need nothing but a bitch that love Vogues
And these all-gold Daytons
Ask Dre Dog  ask Nicky
You ain't getting money, you ain't fucking with Richie
Patron Silver, straight Goose
Twins with me, and they loose
Thirty rounds, town business
Dont make me break records like Guinness
Bitches wanna fuck all day and give head
But I dont fuck for free, ho
Nah, so

[Hook][Hook: Mac Dre]
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
Don't mean shit, shit ain't hot
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it man, don't be scared to squat

[Dre Dog]
Quick fast in a hurry
Squat bounce drop dirty
Cocaine white tiger white walls
HIt the freeway hard at night y'all
With the keys right there I'm ready to drive
Like a eagle at 12 I'm ready to fly
Pager going off, the cell phones ringin'
Al Green's playin' and I keep singin'
Jeans creased up with the beat up
Now I'm about to go pick this little freak up
Blow L's, make mail, ponytails
Had to compliment her on her fresh done nails
Varoom, motherfucker boom boom
A whole block of green lights, freak zoom zoom
Mario Andretti with Blowjob Betty
Pedal to the metal when your ridin' with the devil
Did just that at In-n-Out Burger
No pickles, no onions, no playin'
Check this out no delayin'
Did a donut right is what I'm sayin' SHIT
Police came, I was on the streets
Smokin' more weed, bumpin' more beats
Puttin' more words in the ear of this freak
Cadillac girl, somethin' I'mma keep, Seville?

[Hook]

[Mac Dre]
Cam, lifters, ? shifters
Three fifty one make the old school swifter
Rap in the trunk, slap in the trunk
Fat four-four in my lap for the funk
Talkin' to a beezy on the phone but can't hear her
Turned down the bump, so I can hear clearer
I hear sirens get nearer
Red and blue lights in my rear view mirror
Pull over, nope nope
With a car full of smoke and trunk full of dope
I hit the gasser, go faster
All you hear is dual exhaust, flowmaster
On a chase, I take 'em, then I shake 'em
A real Cutthoat nigga ain't no fakin'
I shoot, ain't scared to scoot
And shake them one time on a hot pursuit

[Hook]This is a dedication
A secret celebration
A Rick James thang
A Mae West thang

Mary Jane and everything

Super drugged out drug store cowboy

Cavity From the Candy Paint

[Verse 1: 100s]
Can I get a what what, skate thru and check it when the nuts bust
Pusha man the ???? projects to the trust fund
Love Jones gotta call his bitch lie, can find your relationship with that nigga
Throw paper crazy, say you love her, tell her you ain't gotta do that baby
And the ???? can come too, with a nigga in a Eddie Murphy Raw jump suit
You got a friend, lookin for a job, not a career? Trust she can come too
Lil' faggot ho on my lap, tryna sock it to my pot of gold
Cus she know on the side of this rainbow huh, ain’t nothing but game ho

I ride, I ride, I ride

Classic, like when a nigga tell a bitch just the tip
And it ain't, never hard to find a player, just follow that drip

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]
Cavity from the candy paint,
Yo this is top rank
I turn around like whatchu thank?
Dipped in butter, super laced
Turn up the Nakamichi
When I floss you gotta see me
Gotta throw my work around
So my work a' work around

Cavity from the candy paint, I like to blow dank
Take down the whole drank, drive at a fast pace
Cavity from the candy paint, I like to blow dank
Take down the whole drank, drive at a fast pace

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
Cavity from the candy paint, press the gas then hit the break
Tiger prawns and New York steak, I'm known to rattle like a snake
Cavity from the candy paint, I do it all again
Buy a quarter ounce of kush, then crack a pint of Henn
Touch it off with lemon squeeze, a double shot, you best believe
I'm bout to drive I got the keys, that’s hot to death but you could freeze
Through there like Marcus Allen, soul food, Chinese and Italian
If she thick then she a stallion, man that’s like countin Paypa
I'm just like Tony Draper, Benzed up on all my neighbors
My Jordan number 5’s are super live, with a touch of flava
I let the weed blow and the engine run like a hot gun
And you know the one when you see the one
Cus when you see the one you wanna be the one

WHAT

[Verse 3: Mac Mall]
Game shootin, calculatin' and computing
Mac the most, Million dollar mouth piece I do it movin'
Do it to em, add more members to my movement
Stand campaigning and recruiting, ?? choosin they ain't stupid
Suckas sad, marks mad, cus they bottom bitch been boosted
Im cut throat Mac, I get the scratch before I goose it
Remix it, reloop it, now she on some new shit
New mackin, New money, new whips and all the cool shit
So corny clowns chattin' to her now is quite useless
But study my every word like creature on the pulpit, church
Don’t come at cuddy wrong or you will get murked
I clap ya in the head if Nickatina don’t get you first
In the Crestside turf, we hit em where it hurts
Gangsta Mac, if you had to describe me with two words
So nigga the news gets served if she missin' rest your nerves
Cus she chose up on some mackin' and no longer hang with herbs

[Hook: Andre Nickatina]

When I met you baby, you was for sale
I just stepped out of the county jail
For a punk ass misdemeanor
My P.O. dont like Nickatina
And an old man was lettin' ya go
And I could see I was what you was looking for
He said bring me a G, then next week a G
I said "Check this out pops I'm back tomorrow at 3"
Dont worry how I got that G
Just worry I was right back there at 3
Started you up, and it was legit
I never thought I'd fall in love so quick
Filled you up with gasoline
Took you to the wash spot and got ya clean
Cleaned the dash, rubbed that ass
And everything was slow, I didn't do it fast
Man it took about an hours time
But you looked so fine from the waxy shine
And on my mind I thought about the Alpines
So I loaded your behind with some 6 x 9's
So when you sing people hear you sang
I'm a nigga so baby I'm a do these thangs
Pioneers blastin' out Aretha Franklin
Sometimes I'm wonderin' what you thankin'

[Hook 2x]
My ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)
You dont fake, steal, cheat, or lie
My ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)
And our relationship is classified

[Verse 2]
I remember the day I bought me some Timbs
That was the same damn day I bought you some rims
At Kims, in the city of dope
And once we hit the streets, me and you, we smoked
On weed, wrapped in chocolate phillies
Other freaks saw us and they went silly
I remember ones name, her name was Billy
The other was a cousin out of Kansas City
They'll drop they clothes, I suppose
But meanwhile my baby girl needs some vogues
She told me everything that was on her mind
Who she loved, who she despised
Why she like the night way better than the day
And did I like Ali or Casius Clay?
I said "I like your conversation how you shoot to kill
But whats this strange relationship?"
She said if I can hang, than she can hang
And we'll never hit the bay bridge in the slow lane
No thang, like bangers bang
And she hate the police just as much as me mayne

[Hook 2x]

I could feel you get jealous when I rented a freak
Your carborator had you layin' up for weeks
Then we smoked like friends, put that to an end
Now I'm back in her muthafuckin' heart again
Cleaned your leather, got a darker tint
Over the rearview got the cherry scent
Hit the streets, like mean Joe Greene
Thats when I told her about my scheme
A night trip back and forth from L.A
So I'm a have to leave you for about a day
It was cool, L.A.'s the spot
But I couldn't wait to see my lady on the block
But just like a bullet had hit my spine
As soon as the focus had hit my eyes
My fist tightened up, I was mad and stunned
My baby was the victim of a hit and run
She was cryin', she said Dre, man I look so ugly
Is there a way you'll ever love me?... Nope
She seen it in my eyes
A brand new vision of a brand new ride

[Hook 2x]
New ride (new ride), New ride (new ride)
That won't fake, steal, or lie
New ride (new ride), New ride (new ride)
And out relationship is classified

Check it...
To my tiga grand wizard
Its me
What (what)
Check it[Verse One]
My drug/rap competitors, they come in flocks
I can't sleep cause when I do I think the game gon' stop
So I'm awake like an owl at a quarter to three
I hit your window with a nickel, "What's up baby, it's me"
Where I'm from we hate cops like we were bred to do it
Believe in Nike signs and gettin' high, so bitch just do it
Right or wrong over right, we'll disobey
Smokin' weed, plottin' greed, listenin' to Sade
Man I hustle all day, eatin' cat fish and (?)
Battle everything from gat clappers to rappers
Try'na have paper from the bottom to the tip
Two words I can't resist; Motherfucker or Bitch
I lost a few nickels but I never drop dimes
Huh, Pisces is the rap sign
Cobra Status!
Swimmin' like the man from Atlantis
A hold like Houdini, but like Houdini I will vanish
Baby was nineteen with a big ol' ass
Shit, damn near gave a nigga whiplash
Don't ask me for money because I'm not gonna share it
Smokin' weed from Bob Marley because he ...(?) the sheriff
You best hope this wax don't cut you
Hope one time don't bust you
This style will finger fuck you
And patna I just can't trust you
Cobra Status!

[Verse Two]
Recognize game when it's on yo' mind
You and that bitch playin' Andre rhymes
(?) situations like an SP-12
Go to hell, I made bail, Nigga fresh outta jail
With the look of the replican, shit gets deep
Already blunted up, and man I'm bumpin' the beat
Real pimp shit all in your bra
Thought it was me, but it's my little cousin Bobby Shaw
Cobra Status!
Nigga I'm the lost pimp of Gladis
Colder than a (?) heart, that's shaked like a habit
Nigga I'm a hawk, you a forest bunny rabbit
My crew stay true but we can also get savage
Cobra Status!

[Verse Three]
Bitch don't call me unless the party is packed
And gangsta shit is bumpin' on every track
Nigga them dice ain't got no love
Shakin' like a nigga scared behind his gun
Cause see, I tick like time and man I time like tick
Man niggas don't forgive and we sure don't forget
It's the receiva, the six feet and ova, ...(?) ice creama
Rollin' cheeba in a beama
With a poetic passion, in a functional fashion
A full tank of gas, and man I'm mashin'
Speed like a Z-28 tinted crow
Look if you want, your reflection will show
Cobra Status!Khan...

My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre
I party through L.A, now baby what you gotta say

[Verse 1]
My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre
I party through L.A., now baby what you gotta say
I live and lay like Sugar Ray, I listen to Sade
You never see me workin, and yeah freak I like to play, OK?
You're thicker than a can of peanut butter, OK?
Talkin' to another brother, givin' me the eye
Man I can't believe those thighs, shit
I can see the freak in your eyes, shit
And if I get you in my coils, I'mma strike for oil
And let me tell you baby girl I'm spoiled
My favorite colour's blue, I'm like the number two
Meanin' that I like to
Have my cake 'n eat it too
She said, "Do you want a drink Nicky baby?" -"Yeah"
"You want me to get it for you baby?"

Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, what up
I'm only in town for one day, what up
Aretha Franklin tapes I like to play, what up
I can see you like the Tanqueray

Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, fast
I'm lookin' like MC Shan, flash
Baby is at least a six footer, ass
We can get together in the middle of the night
Hop into my ride, take flight, that's right
You're rollin' with a pisces, buckle up tight
Slick Rick talkin' like, "da da da..."
Straight chicken hawkin' like, "da da da..."
Caught up in my game like, "da da da..."

My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, I'm over
Baby had hips like boulders, I'm over
Feelin' kinda tipsy man but I ain't really trippin'
Talkin' bout the next expedition
Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre (what up)

[Verse 2]
My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre
I hit the crap table with a four and a tre
I party through L.A., this what I gotta say;
You're mines
Girl what's your zodiac sign?
You're mines
All up in my eyes, you a dime
You're mines
And I'mma keep on spittin' baby only if you're listenin'
Standin' in the gangsta position
Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, what up
We can keep talkin' in the cuts, what up
Damn girl ya got a big butt

Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, fo' real
Baby wearin' jeans 'n high heels, fo' real
They bumpin' Big Daddy Kane like, "da da da..."
And plus rhyme pays like, "da da da..."
And I really ain't ashamed like, "da da da..."

My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre
The plan is to talk to ya girl until you understand
The plan, we can talk about your pants cuz I really don't dance
Standin' in my playboy stance
I look you in the eye, you're rubbin' on my hands
I know you got a man, ya actin' so bold
That's why the game might be feelin' so cold
I say you got control, I put you in the hole
I tell you in your ear, "Do you wanna roll?"
I hear her say "yes"
You're rollin' with the fresh, today
My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, OK?
(OK?)Thats the beat

Mics get hit from bullet flavor I spit
Change the clips and also leave this shit
I be high as fuck when these MCs come
But from dawn to dusk I man breaks 'em up
Like booyow whatcha do now
I can hear them freaks sayin mechow
From head to head
Dread to dread
Lead to lead
Spread to spread
Niggas be trippin' when the indos gone
Niggas be trippin' when they womans gone
Niggas be trippin' when they moneys gone
Thats why I'm rapping on the microphone
Razor Sharp......Crack Raider

Time to build my juice back up
Like the curl of a banger in the Compton cuts
How many MCs do I have to kill
Before I get to the top of the hill
Camoflouge dodge and Pittsburg Black
Doing shows at Alamodes where the niggas be at
We spending food stamps
Avoid them tramps
A van full of beat with the Kenwood amps
Focus like a camera keep your eyes on the birdie
Legit as I can get but I still roll dirty
Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
Crack raider razor raider razor....sharp.....crack raider

A tiga like me can't hit the block
Sucka MCs are like microphone cops
Jumped in the game for the do or die
Hit the microphone stand and got Kentucky Fried
Recognize baby that'll go for broke
Livin in the City where its only on coke
Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp

Going about niiinneettyy
On the freeway choking
Ain't no mystery to the weed we smokin''
Andre Nickatina says show me some snaps
And Andre Nickatina will surely rap
I hate to be a whore but the World's a pimp
I'm trying to tell my niggas man don't y'all simp
Coming like a Mack Truck miss me if ya foul skunk
Represent the blunt when you get tossed up
Microphone flow like the Caddy at Ritz
At 9AM man the contact hits
Cocaine beats in stereo thinkin every car behind man is 5-0
Keepin all my rhymes on a computer chip
The Sugarhill Gang got me doing this
Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
Crack raider razor raider razor....sharp.....crack raider

Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
Crack raider razor raider razor....sharp.....crack raider

Sharp
Sharp

Thats the beat

Saturday

My nigga Mike Mike
The time is 3:27 AM
I'm duckin off Sun Duck Kim[Hook]
It's the daiquiri factory where niggas look after me
Assault and battery it's sort of a tragedy
Kicking it live right with killer suspension
Smoking weed in the kitchen and so reluctant to listen
(x 2)

[Verse 1]
Can you picture the perfect rhyme, the perfect tone, the perfect pitch?
The perfect mind, the perfect crime, the perfect bitch?
So materialistic it make me want to risk it
Hoping the pigs don't pull me over with my new biscuit
I'm sorta twisted, swerving to the next light
I'll bet I be some Tanqueray in my next life
Or a silver gat, man can you picture that?
With all my cousins as bullets meant for the payback
It's sort of slippery, kind of like the street is wet
But I'm a vet so let your tiger recollect
With all the pain fed up with the dope game
That's why I still love my tigers that slang 'caine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Baby said "You look sad, cheer up. What's your name?"
I said "It's Andre, uh! I can't complain"
I love singers and ghetto basketball players
And I spit rap for all the legendary crack slingers
We kick it live, buzzing like a bee hive
And it'll remain that way until we hit the sky
Like Public Enemy #1
Cats come to my show and say they uzi weigh a ton son
You know the chemistry, do you remember me?
Man, I'm your tiger from way back in '83
We ate ice cream and played hoops man
We did all these things before the D game

[Hook]

Bye-bye
