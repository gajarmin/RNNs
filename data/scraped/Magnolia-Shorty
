First Verse [Juvenile]:

Betrayal, for the decline in drug sales
War over turf here will cause more drama than Waco
That's why I lay low, and try to improvise on all your weak spots
See what the street got
For me maybe two cheap Glocks
For free, Benjamin Franklin, currency
Is used to pay bills and insurance to bury me
I'm magna to carta player haters don't bother me
Y'all oughtta be, rollin' shipments instead of quarter ki's
It was told to me
Ca$h Money connect from overseas
Two tons of white ones and maybe
But then they might come so I'ma
Take preparation
Pick out a proper, stash location
Fill it with choppers and watch them
Narcotic cases, undercovers investigatin'
Yo Russ, where the man with the dope?  I'm startin' to get impatient
Two days blew by, our package arrived
Followed by, a call from the boss for me to do a homicide

Second Verse [Magnolia Shorty & B.G.]:

[Magnolia Shorty]

Chillin' in my hood, while you know it's all good
Camoflauged down to the socks with some soldier reeboks
I got's to play it like that, cuz I'm a soldier for real
I told you once I was a soldier, bitch you bout to get killed
That's the deal for '96, cuz you know we ain't playin'
Go and run and panic now you better throw up your hands
And if you stunt, you know I'll catch you, know what I mean?

[B.G.]

Slip on them chucks in the cut...

[Magnolia Shorty]

At that C.Y.C
Magnolia soldier, don't you doubt it, I thought you knew we bout it
A bunch of bout it muthafuckas, smoke weed and get, out it
Throw your head up stand tall, and stand big and fuckin' loaded
I'ma represent where I'm from, the home of the soldiers

Third Verse [B.G.]

B.G. off the top bout drama
And I'ma, duct tape a nigga Mama
Forgot her
Cuz I, be off in the World gat tore
G's I'm bout 4, S.K. clips I unload
I'm floatin' all through that U.P.T.,
Represent V.L. street slangin' heat, you weak
A T-shirt with your face on it
I find out where your set at, I run up on it
Meet us outside, you know that's All On U
They all die ain't no stuntin', do what I gotta do
Game tight when I write, write get a nigga hype
Niggas buckin' through the crowd, startin' a war fight
Pop, pop clear the block
Your Glocks ain't cocked
I make the spot hot, jump out and straight chop
Respect the young nigga, get plum dumb nigga
Shots comin' from drums, nigga who want beef with me?
If you want beef, then brang it
I don't just sang it, gunshots be rangin'
Money and bitches, houses and fly cars
Rottweilers in the yard, also security guards
Big money heavyweight, got ki's and G's
Got cake for days, give it to the B.G.'z
I keep it real this life, a straight muthafuckin' solja
We puttin' tons of coke in the Magnolia

Mac Melph Calio for life[Juvenile]:

You gone take them 5? Or you gone take them to the trial?
And go get denied?
By that probation and you just got, caught with that fry
That alibi ain't gone work
Ain't it somethin' how them niggas from out that three be doin' that dirt?
Score a quarter from oh-oh, rock it up by four-four
Then you can go in them hallways and smoke that fire all day
Shhhh....be quiet
Tonight is the night that we ride
Thirty camoflauge hummers with niggas inside
With choppers, doin', surgery on bodies like head doctors
Be quiet, cuz they mad tonight, we gone act a ass tonight
I'mma take a body to that project for a sacrifice
That Calliope got that dope for less
Fuck around that bitch if you want, and get left
Brains hangin' off the steps, people cryin'
Second line, T-shirtin', feet hurtin' from all of that twerkin'

Chorus

Calliope thug
3rd Ward Solja
Melphanine thug

Second Verse [Juvenile]:

I'm an optimal smokin', chopper totin'
Bustin' caps wide open
Top of line coatin', reebok sportin'
Expedition corner spender
Big fine woman bender, put the weight in the blender
Got big bags by rillas
Shiesty like a splinter, and empty out the braids in the center
U.P.T. fader remember
Follow me, follow me
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on the 3 and you will get stopped boy
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on the 3 and you will get stopped boy
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on P-S-E and you will get stopped boy
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on the third and you will get stopped boy
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on the U and you will get stopped boy

Third Verse [Manny Fresh & Magnolia Shorty]

[Manny Fresh]

I'm from the seventh ward, and I believe in God

Camoflauge over our eyes that's how we do these things

Get buck like the fuck I'm glad I use Dial
Now who the fuck I are? I'm a superstar
Ca$h Money rules everything around me bruh
