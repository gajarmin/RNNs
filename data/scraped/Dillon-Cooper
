[Scratches]
"Gotta get this money, I don't really get to sleep long"
"I need enough money to spend, enough money to give"
"Hustlin' Hustlin'"

[Verse 1: Sido]
Aus'm MV in die Welt raus, ich geb Geld aus
Lederjacke von LV, in hellblau, ah
Charlotte gefällt's, wenn ich ihr Pelz kauf
Und aus dem Schlüpper deiner Frau kannst du'n Zelt bauen
Ich geb noch immer'n Fick drauf, wenn du hatest
Ich seh alles positiv außer einen Aids-Test
Scheiß mal auf Beef, ich lass die Waffen im Schrank
Bin ein erwachsener Mann, aber ich pass' mich nicht an, nein
Wir sehen die Sterne und wir greifen danach
Und weiß ich nicht mehr weiter, frag ich Jägermeister um Rat
Rapper klettern für paar Klicks den Fans noch weiter in' Arsch
Ich weiß, wer es war, er hat noch Scheiße am Bart - Iih!
Wenn ich euch seh', muss ich mich fremdschämen
Fahrt in die Hölle, ihr könnt gerne meinen Benz nehm'
Ich scheiß auf dich und deine hässliche Begleitung
Komm her, mach Faxen und der Rest steht in der Zeitung, ah

[Hook: Sido & (Dillon Cooper)]
Die Welt gehört mir, wenn ich groß bin
(Gotta get this money, I don't really get to sleep long)
Ich kann schlafen, wenn ich tot bin
(Work hard, stack checks, I got rich)
Denn ich muss ackern, muss ackern, ackern
(No rest 'till I'm gone)
Denn ich muss hustlen, muss hustlen, hustlen
(Ain't got no days off)
Denn ich muss ackern, muss ackern, ackern
(Do work and get paid
Watch my bank roll, my paper don't fade)

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]
Champion with a Jordan jersey, some vintage
You know I'm kitted, ain't kiddin'
With none of these dudes, I'm wicked, ah
Sick with it like [?], I'm paid full
My name rules, King Cooper, I brain doom
Can't clap that, your rhymes wack, my lines fat
Can't grasp the concept, y'all still bledding and I'm fresh
Knuckle up and bust them if they pop the combat
What is born, I kill 'em, yo, it's hidden in the contract
Gods define that, define Rap, Sido Zeus
Coop Killer, Hercules, one track no contest
Extraterrestrial contact from the bong hits
Candy kush strong, get 'em high, just off the contact
Jeet Kune Do like Bruce Lee flow
Wing Chun, freekick, go, don't miss no free throw, wow
Gotta get to work, no sleep until I'm in the coffin
Sido, Cooper - rad, if you're not on the team, you not important

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dillon Cooper]
Jup, gotta get this money, cash is realler, count the Benjis
Throwin' hunnids on the floor
I tell 'em "Pick 'em up" like shippers, ah
Cooper killer like a young Bruce Wayne
Young playboys, they be getting that fame
Went to Berlin with a bad ass sound
Am I really going fine, I ain't know her name
Last night I was getting so faded with my nikes on
Siggi got blessed and made three stepping like an icon
Any time we rockin' they taking face like nikon
Tryna get a glimpse and make a memory that's life long

[Verse 4: Sido]
Jetzt wird wieder in die Hände gespuckt
Jetzt wird geackert und die Zeit bis zur Rente genutzt
Also schlaf nicht ein, steh auf,  das Hartz reicht nicht aus
Drum haste auch schon wieder keinen Fahrschein gekauft
Huh, du bist ein broke ass motherfucker
Und ich kann haben, was ich träume, weil ich acker, acker
Aus Blut und Schweiß werden Scheine gemacht
Ich will 'ne eigene Yacht und darum bleibe ich wach

[Hook][Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
It's bout to be a state of elevation
Because the underdog is eatin' cus I'm starvin' like I'm Marvin
Yo, emaciated overdose
Ya never know the feeling that I get whenever I see the same
Bitches who play Dillon come on Facebook catchin' feelings
I'm appealin' now they feel the sound
Tryna get a feelin' on my dick so she can stick around
She just think I'm different now
Tatted up, Braces gone, tell the bitch leave me alone
Only thing she want is for the kid to fucking take her home
And lay it on the table, hop in the range, the game is changin' up
Switch it and I'm dangerous, Michael Jackson's angel dust
Pardon me I'm Harley with these lame MC's that's on me
And I'm jammin' out like Marley with the bitches blonde as Barbie

[Hook]
State of Elevation, now I'm levatatin'
Raisin' stakes and Angel Lake, Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we mutha'fuckin' blazin'!
Hey, We levatatin'
Raisin' stakes and Angel Lake, Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we muthafuckin' blazin'!

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]
I said our friendship's sex and party, after sexin' she was textin'
Her bestfriend cus she want next and I’m sure she gonna get it
With this modern day Mike Seaver, Martin, she was Gina
Told her Syanora it was really nice to meet ya
Now, it's on to the next one, learned the life lesson
Fuck'em but don't love'em so the next day I ain't text'em
It's closed by Anonymous, haters wanna try'n be us
Doo doo doo doo doo, now interested in the politics
The only thing I wanna do is body the game, remember the name
Dillon Cooper the Dark Knight, brass knuckles and knife fights
Get light and Harlem shake, coops time to dominate
The show is on the road, my pockets swollen up, them big bills
Always gotta stay Trill, red light, pop'em off
Top spot to knock'em off, take over like Hijackers
Detonation, coming faster, blowin' up, we mass attackin'
Stevie Wonder, bout to blast it, killin' all these whack ass rappers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dillon Cooper]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Call the muthafuckin' cops, they don't pick up
I got the Ammunition in the system, making hits, get rich and
Bitches on my dick man, it's sick man, I'm livin' this
It's wicked ta wick a bitch, lick a clitoris, I'm feelin' it
Hit a little voodoo child, lay guitar the Hendrix style
Blood and shit, texting Stevie Ray Vaughn, Genghis Khan
An emperor, now cobra Jamaican nigga flexin' ya
Brooklyn is the best in this, haters who need evidence
I'm sellin' it all separate and buildin' money like Tetris
Irrelevance, my detriment, body baggin' perfection
It's expression (?) express, niggas get left
Guitar on my chest spittin' that depth, you heard that I'm
Coming for heads and cuttin' ya neck, better speed up, you 'bout to get left
Sick with the rhymes come with a crime crime, murdered the track, I'm doin' some time
Sick with the rhymes, crook with the crime, murdered the track, I’m doin' some time

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, think I'm gonna go in though

"I’ve wrestled with alligators
I’ve tussled with a whale
I done handcuffed lightning
And throw thunder in jail
You know I’m bad
Just last week, I murdered a rock
Injured a stone, Hospitalized a brick
I’m so mean, I make medicine sick."

Yeah, lets go
Dillon, Cooper, Rad

[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
Reality is kicking in heaven
Kareem Abdul-Jabar this game of death is full of tricks
And I ain't talking Tony Hawk
You're gonna win, you're gonna lose love
Find it out the hard way
We move on and your phone ring
And you realize it's your heart stay
Lover, I had missed you
Where the hell you been at
Called you in the summer just to see where you gon' be at
And then I get this pain
Make me fall down to my knees
And I'm begging and I plead
Won't you help me then I woke up
Up to this bed room
Now I'm looking out this window
Looking in the sky, thought that I just saw a super hero
But that shit is just mystical
Ludacris is crazy, kinda like how my ex-girlfriend from 10th grade just had a baby
Guess I lucked out
That could have been me yo
I pray to god I strapped up
Cause that pussy is a demon
Bitch is scheming
Now you trapped up
Looking back at it I escaped yeah
Looking in my future times is rough but Im'ma stay there

[Hook: Dillon Cooper]
Stay yeah, hallelujah
Pray yeah, speaking from my soul this is real Im'ma make it
Everyday I wake up, looking out this window and I wonder why
I wonder why I'm even here yo but it's clear yo, hey
1 for money, 2 for the show
3 for my niggas who ain't make it out the door
But you know
This shit is real boy
And you know, yeah
That we here boy

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]
When I look up in that mirror see that face is staring back
Sometimes I tend to get the feeling that he telling me I'm wack
Now I'm questioning myself, kinda like my biggest critic
Fuck it I quit it, who am I kidding
Shit is depression what is a lesson
I'm supposed to learn
School ain't never been my thing, clever boy
Academic probation is my life story, hella joy
When I pay them loans babe
And when I'm in the magazines
This gonna *** honor every degree
I wash my face up, clean the negativity
And it appears to be so clear now I got energy
Forgiving all my enemies
Fame, fortune, bitches flashing titties
In every city and I'm taking niggas with me all the time
Been on my grind since I ever stepped into those roller blades
Made mistakes, but I'm gon' have my glory days
Amazing with my excellence, heaven sent
Yes I'm on a mission against myself
That's the only way I'm gonna beat the competition boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dillon Cooper]
Bottle poppin', poppin' bottles
That's what Im'ma do tonight
Roll it with the baddest bitches gonna make me feel alright
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, fucking right
Only self since '92, feeling like I'm Drizzy right
Well alright, huh, educated so you best be smart boy
Elevated to infinity and beyond, boy
No Toy Story but I had a fucking light year
I spit legit, I spit that shit your whole life fear
What you doing, how you been is what they saying now
But what's the reason, is it cause I'm getting paid how
Funny money talks in a lot of different languages
But I say fuck you, yeah my nigga getting arrogant
It's been so long, I've been waiting for it
Anticipating so much I'm shaking but I'm good though
You know I do it for my nigga Cozmik up above yes indeed
Barely using money and roller blades is all I need
So I say yeah, hallelujah
Cause I'm about to blow
Never stopping until I'm napping a my funeral
I want this shit even more than I craved before
When I get it I swear I'm committed
I swear all these demons gonna leave me alone
Impossible is nothing so you know we on now
I'm a Giant just scoring game winning touchdowns
If Hov's the greatest then I guess I'll come in number 2
But not for long cause Im'ma show these niggas how I do

[Outro: Dillon Cooper]
I said it's gonna be a hell of a night
Haha, shout out my nigga Cole
It's that Cole World[Intro]

Are we Good?

My Microphone’s on and Shit right?

Oh, its recording...

Yeah

It’s ‘bout to...Go Down
Right now

You know what i’m saying?

[Verse 1]

I said I got
Two Checks on

[Repeat Hook][Intro:]
Yeah, yeah
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive out here, right?
It’s that all AD game, you know what I’m saying?
It’s Cooper getting’ live

[Verse 1:]
Exclusive young boy steady shining
Flow’s so erratic
Caught the limelights out, undeniable, it’s my right to vibe out
No goons, they always got the 9 out
Cooper killing a while out
To find me who can never ever ever ever predict the sudden addiction
I’m in my kitchen, just chefing up all of my defensive for the opposition
Affirm mission, missionary positions, I’m getting bitches
That mean the kind the mommy pappy she call me from the lobby and trade this here we go
Bitch, it’s my CZO, fuck that, ‘cause I got bills to pay to wait here for my deal
I got kicks to buy so I stay fly
Oh me, oh my, I got to shine so these sucker motherfuckers could just hop on on my dick
Middle fingers to the haters and their fucking clicks
I’m the shit, bitch, bitch, I’m the shit
Diarrhea nasty bastard, I got yeezys nigga
So shut the fuck up with them airwalks, moon walk to outer space, I fair walk
Rock, steady rock so, good fella mob star, space jam mob star, got bars
Brooklyn ‘bout to kill the game, not the East West thing respecting on my better rental
Pac to Big
Deblock the kids, I’m a fresh prince, back up, gotta get these stacks up
Stuffing all this cash under my mattress
Blowing all these trees, better believe, come on, get happy like a partridge
I’m a Martian like titties like Dolly Parton
I beg your pardon, please, can you honestly
Look me in the eyes and say that you don’t feel the chills
Coming up the spine, only the strong survive

[Hook:]
Ridiculous until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
We living rad until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Ridiculous until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2:]
Sharp like thumptecks in other equals
Regal elegance blast, heaven sent …
Promise I won’t tell a lie
I repeat, roll up, you, four blunts, y’all
Chilling out maxim, relaxing oh
Cool with the dime piece, sipping on some jack and jill shit, it’s just so exciting
‘Cause I’m RAD, you know me, rocking out a A3C
Just for the beat, if I’m on the rolling you slow, I gotta go get my rhymes right
You heard that
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t
‘Cause we some murderers, cold bloody killers off the beatbox
Street knock hard rock, Van Halen Franky style
Crazy out the fella shine, cool killer gonna be a cruel winner as I’m getting colder with the flow
We get them chills up your spine, spin around like you dreamed about
Sipping on me, they dreaming in, I’m leaving the studio contemplating about movie roles
I’m trying to be the Fresh prince, learned the theme song and I’ve been spitting on their death since
Lock me up and sell the drugs, better checking rob scheme
Dob themes die for me, girls they be crying for me
I said I’m super sorry, shawty, with all the glory come stories
The nigga just be trying to sell you so police
So I’m a rock, nigga, on the stone
Rocky nigga Im Stallone
Cuba kill ‘em softly like a Fugee time to put ‘em on
Cooper gone

[Hook:][Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]

Pull up in the candy painted Caddy

Never do I ever put the pussy on a pedestal

Get it wet and let it rain

Woooah (repeat 3x)

Woah Woah

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]

Weed smoke sour diesel
Eyes low got me looking

Woah Woah
You don't even know[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
Check, my mental only seeing W's
Don't doubt it, cause the truth is right in front of you
As clear as day that I'm stunting and y'all don't want it
I'm cold blooded, murderous, I'm a dope hunter
I count my stacks in a padded room like I'm your buddy
Straight up, my temper hot, I cool it down tremendously
Can't jeopardize my life and end up with a sentence B
More better than most are clever
I never let no niggas touch my cheddar
Always remember what Hov said
They hate a nigga loving his life
Never forget the day I got that call that October night
Turn on the news and see three niggas shot, but one lost his life
My homie caught the bullets meant for y'all, this shit just ain't right
A pallbearer on my eighteenth birthday, yeah it changed me
I ain't Drake, but I'm telling y'all another was the same G
Furthest thing from perfect, motherfuckers never loved us
Coop kill em with some tusk and leather on the come up (What?)
Rolling marijuana when and where I wanna get high and faded
Ain't ever jaded, I'm wide awake and niggas mad
Y'all ain't never make it
And no debating my legacy gon be celebrated in every nation
I elevated your bitch, red life the fuck up
Crown heights the fuck up
Till the dumb schmucks [?] with no remorse
I'm showing off, they say that if you got it, you flaunted
Well I got it, I'm stacking precedence
Y'all niggas just want it

[Hook: Dillon Cooper]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for pounds to represent me (Right?)
I'm out for all these fucking presidents to represent me

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for pounds to represent me (Say what?)
I'm getting euros, stacking up cheech (Right?)
I'm out for all these fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2: A La $ole]
Check, yo I'm out for presidents to represent me
Hustling, shooting for the stars like a [?]
Nobody could fuck with my team, because yours truly
But snapping a chicken nigga till another two piece
Do we have an understanding, when life play cards
I throw em back like gambit
The shit that I've been going through, they couldn't manage
Eating, but stay hungry
Look how my clan is, forty-seven manners
Make a nigga vanish off the planet once I blam it
Do my damage, I racked up and then I ran it
Bombs over Baghdad, I blast that
M16's with six teens that's worth M's
Why would you ever want the plot to worsen
In the presence of a God, you committed the worst sin
That's blasphemy, uh my trigger working
My blindfolds, so its curtains where my words then
Like manslaughter in chronological order
Crossed four portals with four martyrs
Turned sons to granddaughters
Size from the stars like Taurus  your last one
Finna blow up like a Muslim, promised virgins in the morning
No mourning for the time being
Didn't smoke, but my highness is my being
I'm being everything you not uh
You can never stop son, I shine like the British empire
You cannot run[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Listen, I'm the rock town presidente, kid
Uptown where they sippin' presidentes, it's
The E, to the M-I
Sit in the back of the redeye plane
The way that I'm living you better
Be getting my ass in the penthouse suite
Ain't no leasing, no, I need to own
I put a bitch on silent, just like a cheater's phone
Hush! Nobody want to hear it
We gonna run up in your crib with a bunch of kings and they fully bearded
They half Hispanic and Half American, fully arrogant
I was born to a virgin homie, I know my heritage
Single mother, I don't know what a marriage is
I ain't heard from God or my father, I think they both abandoned us
The game is made up of a bunch of bitches
Cuz all I see is a hundred zeroes doing zero to a hundred mixes
No unconditional love, homie, there's one condition
I need a moment of silence after I'm fucking finished
Bang!

[Verse 2: Dreezy]
Let me go and kill it one time
I been thumbing through the paper like the Sun Times
I look inocent when I wear my bobs and weaves
But the way I bob and weave
You get flatlined by a punchline
These niggas ain't the greatest like Scotty Pippen
I feel like the truth and I mean more than the definition
I got the heat that'll make LeBron come back
They come to Dreez for the spins: I'm a laundromat
You bring that beef like burgers, we'll body your five guys
I'm a dog but I be living life like I got 9 lives
Rappers want me on the track, but askin' if I got a verse to send
Just in case they want to go and write their verse again
It's evident my intelligence got them jealous
They tell me I got potential, I feel like they need development
I body rappers and leave them there with a skeleton
Felon, but I ain't telling I'm ending veterans' relevance

[Verse 3: Dillon Cooper]
Yo, I'm bringing it back, because my flow's tight
I break bars quicker than body parts
You get cracked with a chrome pipe
Same hustler's on my block since I was a youngin
Used to call me Tony Hawk cause I was skatin' instead of thuggin'
And that's word life
My tongue switch words like white chicks with scoliosis
Giving [?] in the back of the whip on the turnpike
Dark Knight, fix you a knuckle sandwich that's on site
Don't play yourself homey, man I'm the wrong type
To mess with
Blow your candles out, that's a death wish
Introspection, De La Soul said I'm next, man
[?] killer monumental [?]
Could be Nas' apprentice
Oh see my knowledge complex like forensics
You can't compare my style to no nigga
My steez Versace, and y'all Forever 21 like gold diggers
So knuckle up, if you think that you can hang
And if not, then let me do my thing

[Verse 4: Jace Two-9]
I was off [?] Sunday morning with a thirty
Crosses on my denim
[?] got me feeling holy
Hustled on me rolley
So fuck what the teachers told me
Hood nigga out in Beverly Hills, Axel Foley
Came down like rain how these girls see me they wet
In H-town with a [?] now, pipe down cause I'm next
This way or a that a way
You madder than a hatter, say
Boondock saint, cause I said later with the latter day
I can make your girl [?] sing Donnie Hathaway
She no answer when her phone ring, cause she banging me
Like she Uncle Ben
Ask my nines, any girl I'm with a fucking ten
I said I'm either going off or I'm going in
I said I'm either doing dope or I'm counting ends
Joey, Rachel, Chandler, Ross, we just fucking friends
Now she want to touch again
After that I'm gonna pass her back, like I'm Peyton Man
[?] uber-maneuver how we gonna move
Finally call Johnny and tell him it's time to move now
Fiends hold the weed, them coppers we acting too wild
Bust a rhyme, we the leaders of the new school now
With this mic I will [?] just for me and mine
Pockets flexed up no creatine
Man, where I'm at? Boy I'm sipping shine
Pour 4-4's, Mike Jones, man I'm sipping fine
I'm a giver, flexing up, sipping wine
Only hit Lennox up for jeans and a finish line
Don't worry about me or my life of crime
Girl is bad as Rita Ora for oral at dinner time

[Verse 5: Conceited]
Young tatted nigga, who fly as fuck
Whip got hoes in it like a fire truck
Why would I not bring the cash out
When the shoes cost a bando like a trap house
Nothing but gold on a nigga
I don't deal with sterling, I'm so like the Clippers
I'm a spitter, rhyming with these bars
I'm in a class by myself like a retard
Spent cheese on hi-tops, I got guap
The way I'm balling haters wish I had a shot clock
I don't deal with short stacks, I ain't IHOP
Money like Visine, see what I drop?
My Glock is on me, though
Here to pop a nigga like the Maury show
And she like Comcast, cause she on demand
Cause I'm balling like a bitch, Juwanna Mann

[Verse 6: Andy Mineo]
Mama said I was headed for prison, causing mischief
Doing what I saw on television, I
Wanted that KFC living, you know
Riding around with a biscuit in a bucket with a couple chickens
What would you do if I told you that [?] was true religion?
You would probably ask me how they fit in
It's cool if you searching for God, then y'all with it
But the moment you said you found Him
All the sudden you tripping
I think God's giving all these rappers all this
To make them think about the lyrics they recorded
They like "Look back at it. Look back."
It's cool until your baby girl's on the other side of that statement
Uptown they be puffing on the marley
Sipping on the latest like the car's so tardy
And corporations want money off of hip hop
That's why you get a Kendrick doll with your Barbie
That's that [?] my team winning
One sixteen we so storming they don't know us cause, uh
We been in the cut, that's neosporin, get familiar
We doper than a kilo of that foreign
And I'm feeling like I'm Jordan from that free throw
Dunking on this beat, though
Flowing on December go get your pico
Go ahead keep the ego stuff to yourself
Paint the big picture then rap the easel[Scratches]
"Gotta get this money, I don't really get to sleep long"
"I need enough money to spend, enough money to give"
"Hustlin' Hustlin'"

[Verse 1: Sido]
Aus'm MV in die Welt raus, ich geb Geld aus
Lederjacke von LV, in hellblau, ah
Charlotte gefällt's, wenn ich ihr Pelz kauf
Und aus dem Schlüpper deiner Frau kannst du'n Zelt bauen
Ich geb noch immer'n Fick drauf, wenn du hatest
Ich seh alles positiv außer einen Aids-Test
Scheiß mal auf Beef, ich lass die Waffen im Schrank
Bin ein erwachsener Mann, aber ich pass' mich nicht an, nein
Wir sehen die Sterne und wir greifen danach
Und weiß ich nicht mehr weiter, frag ich Jägermeister um Rat
Rapper klettern für paar Klicks den Fans noch weiter in' Arsch
Ich weiß, wer es war, er hat noch Scheiße am Bart - Iih!
Wenn ich euch seh', muss ich mich fremdschämen
Fahrt in die Hölle, ihr könnt gerne meinen Benz nehm'
Ich scheiß auf dich und deine hässliche Begleitung
Komm her, mach Faxen und der Rest steht in der Zeitung, ah

[Hook: Sido & (Dillon Cooper)]
Die Welt gehört mir, wenn ich groß bin
(Gotta get this money, I don't really get to sleep long)
Ich kann schlafen, wenn ich tot bin
(Work hard, stack checks, I got rich)
Denn ich muss ackern, muss ackern, ackern
(No rest 'till I'm gone)
Denn ich muss hustlen, muss hustlen, hustlen
(Ain't got no days off)
Denn ich muss ackern, muss ackern, ackern
(Do work and get paid
Watch my bank roll, my paper don't fade)

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]
Champion with a Jordan jersey, some vintage
You know I'm kitted, ain't kiddin'
With none of these dudes, I'm wicked, ah
Sick with it like [?], I'm paid full
My name rules, King Cooper, I brain doom
Can't clap that, your rhymes wack, my lines fat
Can't grasp the concept, y'all still bledding and I'm fresh
Knuckle up and bust them if they pop the combat
What is born, I kill 'em, yo, it's hidden in the contract
Gods define that, define Rap, Sido Zeus
Coop Killer, Hercules, one track no contest
Extraterrestrial contact from the bong hits
Candy kush strong, get 'em high, just off the contact
Jeet Kune Do like Bruce Lee flow
Wing Chun, freekick, go, don't miss no free throw, wow
Gotta get to work, no sleep until I'm in the coffin
Sido, Cooper - rad, if you're not on the team, you not important

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dillon Cooper]
Jup, gotta get this money, cash is realler, count the Benjis
Throwin' hunnids on the floor
I tell 'em "Pick 'em up" like shippers, ah
Cooper killer like a young Bruce Wayne
Young playboys, they be getting that fame
Went to Berlin with a bad ass sound
Am I really going fine, I ain't know her name
Last night I was getting so faded with my nikes on
Siggi got blessed and made three stepping like an icon
Any time we rockin' they taking face like nikon
Tryna get a glimpse and make a memory that's life long

[Verse 4: Sido]
Jetzt wird wieder in die Hände gespuckt
Jetzt wird geackert und die Zeit bis zur Rente genutzt
Also schlaf nicht ein, steh auf,  das Hartz reicht nicht aus
Drum haste auch schon wieder keinen Fahrschein gekauft
Huh, du bist ein broke ass motherfucker
Und ich kann haben, was ich träume, weil ich acker, acker
Aus Blut und Schweiß werden Scheine gemacht
Ich will 'ne eigene Yacht und darum bleibe ich wach

[Hook][Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]

Pull up in the candy painted Caddy

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]

You don't even know[Intro ]
Yo this is that dungeon shit you know what I’m saying? That Bat Cave 9-2, RAD life you know. Coop Killa

[Verse 1 ]
Ayo you better flee, opps
Or get your head blown 3 blocks
No patience for suckers and busters get they knees popped
Ain't time for questions and answers, thats word to Iverson
I’m bout the game and y'all talking bout practice, come off them Reeboks
I’m bringing rap back, and I don’t need no backpack
Cause the homies got duffle bags, fuck a knapsack
Black kings, badmon fly like big wings
Locking shit down like solitary up in Xin Xing
Do re mi fa so la
I’m cosmic solar
Told the chola “hola”, then the next thing you know I’m all up in that chocha
Feel me?
Make shit pop and I ain't talking about a wheelie
Silly Dilly, I’m so crazy, wavy, 90’s baby
Flaming niggas like a god, I’m bout to tell 'em call me Hades
Maybe then they’ll think I’m hot off top
Let me stop,let it rock, no I’m not
Its politics as usual and I’ma state it now
I’m Gotham Citys saviour bow down

[hook]
I’m in the cave nightly all black and they watching tryna know wassup
What up blood? What up cuz?
Hold up man you don’t even know me son, you just a joker
Riddle me this, riddle me that
Why you wanna know where I be at?
I be in that Bat Cave, all black
I be in that Bat Cave, all black

[verse 2]
I’m in the dark of the cave with the bats, where the fortress at?
Got corpses with white tees and the air forces black
Who that? Who that? Rip track, boom bap, do rock
Can’t put me in a box, I got too many flavors right on deck
Check. Hilarious, these homies ask me if I’m still rapping
I should’ve said nah cause what I do is heavenly
Sent to me, its meant to be
In other words an entity
And if you ain’t my friend then you my motherfucking enemy
I’m ripping these niggas up limb for limb, how you think you compare to me?
Never look into my eyes I’ll turn you to stone; Medusa. You scared of me
Better stay up in your lane my nigga you lame you never compare to me
Not equal. Bow down, homie we not peoples
I think you got yourself into a situation
Holding conversations and know your limitations
Face it, you basic
Word to my mother you ain’t shit
Better remember that [?]

[Hook]

[outro]
Its that dungeon shit you know? Its Coop Killer
Brooklyn really iller. Feel me?[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
Check, my mental only seeing W's
Don't doubt it, cause the truth is right in front of you
As clear as day that I'm stunting and y'all don't want it
I'm cold blooded, murderous, I'm a dope hunter
I count my stacks in a padded room like I'm your buddy
Straight up, my temper hot, I cool it down tremendously
Can't jeopardize my life and end up with a sentence B
More better than most are clever
I never let no niggas touch my cheddar
Always remember what Hov said
They hate a nigga loving his life
Never forget the day I got that call that October night
Turn on the news and see three niggas shot, but one lost his life
My homie caught the bullets meant for y'all, this shit just ain't right
A pallbearer on my eighteenth birthday, yeah it changed me
I ain't Drake, but I'm telling y'all another was the same G
Furthest thing from perfect, motherfuckers never loved us
Coop kill em with some tusk and leather on the come up (What?)
Rolling marijuana when and where I wanna get high and faded
Ain't ever jaded, I'm wide awake and niggas mad
Y'all ain't never make it
And no debating my legacy gon be celebrated in every nation
I elevated your bitch, red life the fuck up
Crown heights the fuck up
Till the dumb schmucks [?] with no remorse
I'm showing off, they say that if you got it, you flaunted
Well I got it, I'm stacking precedence
Y'all niggas just want it

[Hook: Dillon Cooper]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for pounds to represent me (Right?)
I'm out for all these fucking presidents to represent me

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for pounds to represent me (Say what?)
I'm getting euros, stacking up cheech (Right?)
I'm out for all these fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2: A La $ole]
Check, yo I'm out for presidents to represent me
Hustling, shooting for the stars like a [?]
Nobody could fuck with my team, because yours truly
But snapping a chicken nigga till another two piece
Do we have an understanding, when life play cards
I throw em back like gambit
The shit that I've been going through, they couldn't manage
Eating, but stay hungry
Look how my clan is, forty-seven manners
Make a nigga vanish off the planet once I blam it
Do my damage, I racked up and then I ran it
Bombs over Baghdad, I blast that
M16's with six teens that's worth M's
Why would you ever want the plot to worsen
In the presence of a God, you committed the worst sin
That's blasphemy, uh my trigger working
My blindfolds, so its curtains where my words then
Like manslaughter in chronological order
Crossed four portals with four martyrs
Turned sons to granddaughters
Size from the stars like Taurus  your last one
Finna blow up like a Muslim, promised virgins in the morning
No mourning for the time being
Didn't smoke, but my highness is my being
I'm being everything you not uh
You can never stop son, I shine like the British empire
You cannot run[Verse 1 : Nemir]
Yo, posé, j'fume une clope devant mon ordi
Mon phone sonne, j'reçois un mess', check des mails
[Y'en a?] une prod pour un feat avec Dillon, j'pilote
J'ai vu des potes se mettre à tiser, dealer, se faire filoche
Sortir de boîte, rouler en caisse, se crasher contre un pylône
J'm'isole, regrette le passé, d'avoir séché les cours
J'ai beau chercher mais rien ne vient effacer mes doutes
Envie d'me casser, j'étouffe, mon [cœur?] fait des détours
On a c'qu'on mérite, c'est comme ça, c'est la vie, c'est tout
On passe nos étés à cramer, comme dans un four
Les p'tits d'chez moi s'croient dans GTA, s'tapent pour un foot
En bas d'mon bâtiment, l'avenir est carrément flou
La plupart de mes gars sont devenus tarés, quasiment fous
Ma mère voulait y croire, faire de moi un gosse clean
Rentre essoufflé tous les soirs, comme après un gros sprint
J'fais peur de m'noyer, autour de moi, tout est trop speed
Allez, j'roule un gros spliff, j'apprends et gère mes propres crises

[Hook]
All around the world, no one's got a fly to catch
Everywhere we go, they'd be sayin' that we're fresh
Cause we global
Cause we global
They respect the style, represented to the death
Everything I do, man, I do it to the best
Cause we're global
And we're global

[Verse 2 : Dillon Cooper]
Smokin' In alleyways
? smellin' the reefer
Hot like a young Khalifa
Swerve when they trynna reach ya'
Hop on the 48 ?
He countin' stacks of paper
Man it's good over here
?
Multitasking a lot
Cuz time is money
Minutes is dollars
24 hours and I could be stackin'
Man it's addicting
Learn a couple things from your boy
If you listen
Cookin up in my kitchen[Intro]

Are we Good?

My Microphone’s on and Shit right?

Oh, its recording...

Yeah

It’s ‘bout to...Go Down
Right now

You know what i’m saying?

[Verse 1]

I said I got
Two Checks on
The Left and Right like Nike
A lot of dudes I don’t know claiming that they don’t like me
Fight Me
Clean Cut and I’m Sharper than a razor blade
Since Razor days
Line me up and Watch these niggas
Catch a Fade
Get cash Fast
Give them Whiplash

I said I had to drop a mixtape, cause my shit Great
Whoever tries to knock me off failing
Theyre learning that they making mistakes
Physical LightWeight
But Mentally Im Heavy yo
A dynamo
ADD tried to Prescribe me ADDERAL

In gym class I watched bitches playing Volleyball
Puerto Rican Cuties got Twitter names with an Underscore
Olé I say and I just teased em like a Matador
Taking Names

You could say i’m building rapport
Other niggas not
Two equals
Isosceles
Middle Fingers Up
Thats the PAC in me
Get into your head with the Psychology

That's what you call KUNG FOO

[Repeat Hook][Verse 1]
Said I lost you on a Summer day
Maybe it was Fall up in the Winter time
But you would fly, feuds, cause I used to lie
Tied up in a ball with you, a noose around my neck
I'm out of breath, I close my eyes
Try to forget all the the times I had to lie to you repeatedly
Keep you smiling vividly, I hated you and loved you too
Know you fucked them other dudes who claimed that was before me
I don't give a fuck, you gave it up, you funky slut
I said it to your face I know you fucked me up, but
I love you, never another above you
Begging can I plead that I never see your face cause if I do the lips I taste uh
Sweet surrender, two weeks, you lay upon my face, I
Close my eyes cause I don't know how much more I can take
I'm sorry, cause things ain't working out
Surprised you never expected words to bring your mood from North to South
The emotional roller coaster, up and down in circles
I roll zig-zags smoking purple, stupid shit can really hurt you

[Hook]
Go, go, go, away because you're making it hard, you're making it hard for me
I can't sleep, you're a distraction, my mind's reacting, Chemical inbalance
(Ooh) I am for real, never meant to make your daughter cry, I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 2]
I wait for you at Prospect Park
Third car from the stairs, hop on the train
We stare into each others eyes suprised you
So infatuated with my looks
Love for you has grown but years has passed
Yo sexy ass, my lady talking about having my baby
I agree you are the one for me, others beg to differ
You get mad cause I love women, see 'em whenever I'm with you
I ain't mad at you, on the second thought I'm kinda happy
Cause I see that I'm your everything
You don't need a wedding ring I, know you love me
Shit is feeling funny, still don't know if the love is real
It's hurting like Holyfield
Yeah the truth is painful walking with you feeling shameful
Cause I'm smashing what he passed up, nigga's saying I'm gassed up
Pussy got me slowed down and then I'm feeling [that rush?]
Thought I was a king but this ass a peasants hands touched
Now I am a jester, guess who got the best of, me and now I'm stressed out
Hands out, left out
You never loved me, that's something that I told myself
To detonate the feelings I had hiding like Saddam
Feeling covered like kid jobs, you did your job and now you're fired
Flabbergasted cause I smashed her and you saw the pictures
It's because I missed ya, not saying I missed ya
But I'm talking about the time that homie was just all up in ya
Baby girl surrender bow down to the master
Brooklyn boy, Dillon Cooper lucky bastard

[Hook]
Go, go, go, away because you're making it hard, you're making it hard for me
I can't sleep, you're a distraction, my mind's reacting, Chemical Inbalance
(Ooh) I am for real, never meant to make your daughter cry, I apologize a trillion times

[Instrumental][Intro]
Yeah, think I'm gonna go in though

"I’ve wrestled with alligators
I’ve tussled with a whale
I done handcuffed lightning
And throw thunder in jail
You know I’m bad
Just last week, I murdered a rock
Injured a stone, Hospitalized a brick
I’m so mean, I make medicine sick."

Yeah, lets go
Dillon, Cooper, Rad

[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
Reality is kicking in heaven
Kareem Abdul-Jabar this game of death is full of tricks
And I ain't talking Tony Hawk
You're gonna win, you're gonna lose love
Find it out the hard way
We move on and your phone ring
And you realize it's your heart stay
Lover, I had missed you
Where the hell you been at
Called you in the summer just to see where you gon' be at
And then I get this pain
Make me fall down to my knees
And I'm begging and I plead
Won't you help me then I woke up
Up to this bed room
Now I'm looking out this window
Looking in the sky, thought that I just saw a super hero
But that shit is just mystical
Ludacris is crazy, kinda like how my ex-girlfriend from 10th grade just had a baby
Guess I lucked out
That could have been me yo
I pray to god I strapped up
Cause that pussy is a demon
Bitch is scheming
Now you trapped up
Looking back at it I escaped yeah
Looking in my future times is rough but Im'ma stay there

[Hook: Dillon Cooper]
Stay yeah, hallelujah
Pray yeah, speaking from my soul this is real Im'ma make it
Everyday I wake up, looking out this window and I wonder why
I wonder why I'm even here yo but it's clear yo, hey
1 for money, 2 for the show
3 for my niggas who ain't make it out the door
But you know
This shit is real boy
And you know, yeah
That we here boy

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]
When I look up in that mirror see that face is staring back
Sometimes I tend to get the feeling that he telling me I'm wack
Now I'm questioning myself, kinda like my biggest critic
Fuck it I quit it, who am I kidding
Shit is depression what is a lesson
I'm supposed to learn
School ain't never been my thing, clever boy
Academic probation is my life story, hella joy
When I pay them loans babe
And when I'm in the magazines
This gonna *** honor every degree
I wash my face up, clean the negativity
And it appears to be so clear now I got energy
Forgiving all my enemies
Fame, fortune, bitches flashing titties
In every city and I'm taking niggas with me all the time
Been on my grind since I ever stepped into those roller blades
Made mistakes, but I'm gon' have my glory days
Amazing with my excellence, heaven sent
Yes I'm on a mission against myself
That's the only way I'm gonna beat the competition boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dillon Cooper]
Bottle poppin', poppin' bottles
That's what Im'ma do tonight
Roll it with the baddest bitches gonna make me feel alright
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, fucking right
Only self since '92, feeling like I'm Drizzy right
Well alright, huh, educated so you best be smart boy
Elevated to infinity and beyond, boy
No Toy Story but I had a fucking light year
I spit legit, I spit that shit your whole life fear
What you doing, how you been is what they saying now
But what's the reason, is it cause I'm getting paid how
Funny money talks in a lot of different languages
But I say fuck you, yeah my nigga getting arrogant
It's been so long, I've been waiting for it
Anticipating so much I'm shaking but I'm good though
You know I do it for my nigga Cozmik up above yes indeed
Barely using money and roller blades is all I need
So I say yeah, hallelujah
Cause I'm about to blow
Never stopping until I'm napping a my funeral
I want this shit even more than I craved before
When I get it I swear I'm committed
I swear all these demons gonna leave me alone
Impossible is nothing so you know we on now
I'm a Giant just scoring game winning touchdowns
If Hov's the greatest then I guess I'll come in number 2
But not for long cause Im'ma show these niggas how I do

[Outro: Dillon Cooper]
I said it's gonna be a hell of a night
Haha, shout out my nigga Cole
It's that Cole World[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
It's bout to be a state of elevation
Because the underdog is eatin' cus I'm starvin' like I'm Marvin
Yo, emaciated overdose
Ya never know the feeling that I get whenever I see the same
Bitches who play Dillon come on Facebook catchin' feelings
I'm appealin' now they feel the sound
Tryna get a feelin' on my dick so she can stick around
She just think I'm different now
Tatted up, Braces gone, tell the bitch leave me alone
Only thing she want is for the kid to fucking take her home
And lay it on the table, hop in the range, the game is changin' up
Switch it and I'm dangerous, Michael Jackson's angel dust
Pardon me I'm Harley with these lame MC's that's on me
And I'm jammin' out like Marley with the bitches blonde as Barbie

[Hook]
State of Elevation, now I'm levatatin'
Raisin' stakes and Angel Lake, Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we mutha'fuckin' blazin'!
Hey, We levatatin'
Raisin' stakes and Angel Lake, Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we muthafuckin' blazin'!

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]
I said our friendship's sex and party, after sexin' she was textin'
Her bestfriend cus she want next and I’m sure she gonna get it
With this modern day Mike Seaver, Martin, she was Gina
Told her Syanora it was really nice to meet ya
Now, it's on to the next one, learned the life lesson
Fuck'em but don't love'em so the next day I ain't text'em
It's closed by Anonymous, haters wanna try'n be us
Doo doo doo doo doo, now interested in the politics
The only thing I wanna do is body the game, remember the name
Dillon Cooper the Dark Knight, brass knuckles and knife fights
Get light and Harlem shake, coops time to dominate
The show is on the road, my pockets swollen up, them big bills
Always gotta stay Trill, red light, pop'em off
Top spot to knock'em off, take over like Hijackers
Detonation, coming faster, blowin' up, we mass attackin'
Stevie Wonder, bout to blast it, killin' all these whack ass rappers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dillon Cooper]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Call the muthafuckin' cops, they don't pick up
I got the Ammunition in the system, making hits, get rich and
Bitches on my dick man, it's sick man, I'm livin' this
It's wicked ta wick a bitch, lick a clitoris, I'm feelin' it
Hit a little voodoo child, lay guitar the Hendrix style
Blood and shit, texting Stevie Ray Vaughn, Genghis Khan
An emperor, now cobra Jamaican nigga flexin' ya
Brooklyn is the best in this, haters who need evidence
I'm sellin' it all separate and buildin' money like Tetris
Irrelevance, my detriment, body baggin' perfection
It's expression (?) express, niggas get left
Guitar on my chest spittin' that depth, you heard that I'm
Coming for heads and cuttin' ya neck, better speed up, you 'bout to get left
Sick with the rhymes come with a crime crime, murdered the track, I'm doin' some time
Sick with the rhymes, crook with the crime, murdered the track, I’m doin' some time

[Hook][Intro:]
Yeah, yeah
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive out here, right?
It’s that all AD game, you know what I’m saying?
It’s Cooper getting’ live

[Verse 1:]
Exclusive young boy steady shining
Flow’s so erratic
Caught the limelights out, undeniable, it’s my right to vibe out
No goons, they always got the 9 out
Cooper killing a while out
To find me who can never ever ever ever predict the sudden addiction
I’m in my kitchen, just chefing up all of my defensive for the opposition
Affirm mission, missionary positions, I’m getting bitches
That mean the kind the mommy pappy she call me from the lobby and trade this here we go
Bitch, it’s my CZO, fuck that, ‘cause I got bills to pay to wait here for my deal
I got kicks to buy so I stay fly
Oh me, oh my, I got to shine so these sucker motherfuckers could just hop on on my dick
Middle fingers to the haters and their fucking clicks
I’m the shit, bitch, bitch, I’m the shit
Diarrhea nasty bastard, I got yeezys nigga
So shut the fuck up with them airwalks, moon walk to outer space, I fair walk
Rock, steady rock so, good fella mob star, space jam mob star, got bars
Brooklyn ‘bout to kill the game, not the East West thing respecting on my better rental
Pac to Big
Deblock the kids, I’m a fresh prince, back up, gotta get these stacks up
Stuffing all this cash under my mattress
Blowing all these trees, better believe, come on, get happy like a partridge
I’m a Martian like titties like Dolly Parton
I beg your pardon, please, can you honestly
Look me in the eyes and say that you don’t feel the chills
Coming up the spine, only the strong survive

[Hook:]
Ridiculous until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
We living rad until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Ridiculous until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2:]
Sharp like thumptecks in other equals
Regal elegance blast, heaven sent …
Promise I won’t tell a lie
I repeat, roll up, you, four blunts, y’all
Chilling out maxim, relaxing oh
Cool with the dime piece, sipping on some jack and jill shit, it’s just so exciting
‘Cause I’m RAD, you know me, rocking out a A3C
Just for the beat, if I’m on the rolling you slow, I gotta go get my rhymes right
You heard that
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t
‘Cause we some murderers, cold bloody killers off the beatbox
Street knock hard rock, Van Halen Franky style
Crazy out the fella shine, cool killer gonna be a cruel winner as I’m getting colder with the flow
We get them chills up your spine, spin around like you dreamed about
Sipping on me, they dreaming in, I’m leaving the studio contemplating about movie roles
I’m trying to be the Fresh prince, learned the theme song and I’ve been spitting on their death since
Lock me up and sell the drugs, better checking rob scheme
Dob themes die for me, girls they be crying for me
I said I’m super sorry, shawty, with all the glory come stories
The nigga just be trying to sell you so police
So I’m a rock, nigga, on the stone
Rocky nigga Im Stallone
Cuba kill ‘em softly like a Fugee time to put ‘em on
Cooper gone

Titty boppin and i'm rocky never stoppin jump one time hip hoppin right

(chorus)
This is regular everyday life in my mind

Verse 2
