[Bridge]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 1: Sean]
And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga mayne, all the people I plotted with
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're on high hills
Tits sittin' high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man

[Hook]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Sean]
Cause the penthouse 90 floors up
Make love and then join the mile high club
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams
I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size
Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big and I never plan to downsize
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads
Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs
Lookin' at my highlights with a bitch with highlights
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna say hi right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
If you roll one up, I'mma roll one too
Oh you sayin' you don't smoke? Well that's all that we do
You be up in the club, I be up in the clouds
Ooh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the O, even my fans smoke it
Cause' they throw it at my shows hidin' it when I travel
In case the police gotta know, rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest, I'm livin' so lavish
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna get at this cabbage
My pinky ring a V8, I filled it with carrots
I'm popeye with spinach, till' the day I die I'm gettin' high

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 4: Chiddy Bang]
I'm fly, my swell on Priceline
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just write rhymes
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit
I always knew that I would be the man
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a peter pan, we the fam
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick
Loud, yea it's worth a thousand words on some picture shit
When it comes to smokin' we have a certificate
I know them haters is wishin' we fakin', licorice
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L
I need a high class chick that I match up with well
She familiar with Fendi, comfortable in Chanel
And you know errthang' high when you livin' swell

[Hook][Intro: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah, yeah
First team bitch
Stop - Hoodie time

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Bitches bow down, don't even know me
Told me I'm a dog like Odie
And I only fuck with crazy girls like I'm home like I'm Brody
Made her come trice like Obie, damn
So I don't shop at Alexander McQueen (why?)
I don't even know what that mean
Tryna live life on an everyday scheme
The minute you met me was kind of a wet dream, well
We don't got that in common
These bitches want the Action Bronson
I give a little Magic Johnson
Then she wanna hold my wand like Emma Watson
Oh they mad cause I got flow
And these other rappers cheesy like a nacho
So my pockets getting bigger like Lovato
But you ain't got no fuckin' Hoodie in your Serato?

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Talk to me, tell me your name
You want my life, I want the same
You say that it's meant to be, it's meant to be
You ain't no celebrity, so stop
Cause fame is for assholes

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Hold up, stop, came here with a mission
They didn't pick me first like I'm Griffin
But I don't give a fuck, no Luck I got 20/20 vision
I can see like everything he missin'
Got a bad bitch, she my cash cow, she my cash cow
I'mma make a million dollars so I have her pass out
Pass blunts, babe, I can get you Emma Stoned
And I don't ever leave my bed alone
Tryna tell my future like Cleo
Tell me I’m the one, treat the kid like he Neo, damn
Thousand white bitches in the club, that's a kilo
Let me spill this cash like the Rio, Grande
I'm all about the ass and bush
That's why they lookin' at me like I'm Ashton Kush
I'm a bastard, look
I'm a fashion crook
So let me take your clothes off, damn

[Hook]
Cause fame is for assholes [5x]

[Verse 3: Chiddy Bang]
Stop - Chiddy time
I hear girl like "come to the telly"
Hit me on the phone you could run to the celly
Just walked in, why they lookin' at me doe?
Girl you the bomb, could we lay like Frito?
I got my jacket for you if you a tad cold
Swack ho, probably gettin' tail like a tadpole
First time I seen her man she wave like a flagpole
She tryna fuck fame but that shit is for assholes
Yeah, since I heard they finish first
I'mma appetize then I get that pussy for dessert
Clock, clock in you know I always put in work
Tryna find her easy she got designer on her purse
I don't need to know your accolades
I could do that shit in half a day
Act brand new but that's okay
Cause I'm about to get the cat, Anne Hathaway, hey!

[Hook][Verse 1: Big Sean]
They say I’m too fake, fuck it I’m paid
I can’t even find an empty spot inside my safe
I got Carties on my eyes, Louis on my case
Lobster, shrimp, and calamari right here chilling on my plate
They tell me I’m on time, even when I’m late
Even if it’s a lie they say everything is great
I’m grabbin’ the fattest asses, just to see ‘em shake
I swear I’m too real to be, I’m too real to be livin’ so fake

[Hook]
Look out!
Cause I’m just too fake for the world
I know it’s just a game to me
I’m just too fake you see
I wish I didn’t have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It’s breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don’t like it but it’s true

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
"Yeah I know Sean, I swear that nigga ain’t shit
Known him for forever and he ain’t on the same shit
It breaks my heart when all the kids be yelling 'You the mayne, Big'
He ain’t no hometown hero, he on that LeBron James shit"
Man I tell them suck my dick then choke on a nut
Cause when they see me it’s "Oh, It's Big, What's up?"
Man for the team, man, fam, or regime
Might knock down any door, open it up
Got on and now you startin’ actin’ different huh?
No really I wasn’t fuckin’ with you from the beginnin’ bruh
Here we are, here we go, my circle tighter than a Cheerio
People want a handle like silver spoons
People want a handout like here you go
Man, the realest nigga I know is inside the mirror bro
And these fools be trippin’ like a suitcase, a shoelace
They too fake, and I’m too real, yeah, boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chiddy]
Fake it til you make it
What happens when you do?
Friends turn to strangers, so I’m a stranger, too
They want this or that
Boy gotta hustle like a flip or pack
Year a go a nigga wasn't gettin' scratch
When I hit the booth I came up with a sick attack
Oh yes, feelin’ so strong we about to take the game like Conquest
Wish we fail, but they check pre-sales, and a hater gets proven wrong, yes
They just bantering, calls I’m not answering
Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring
But Chiddy jigga with these girls we be on the next
And they get mad cause we really don’t respond to text
Yeah, they say I, may be just on the shady side
Maybe I, grow so much and I smoke so much got a lazy eye
Yeah I’m too gone, this the new shit to get loose on
The boy Chiddy and Sean on a new song
If you ain’t with it, tell me what the fuck you on
I said I in heads, made it off of Big chance
Yeah and still the game can make you fake like implant
But I'm real[Hook]
I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo money mo problems, when I get it I'mma pile it up
Now I'm dope wonderbread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm rippin' up shows and 'em fans goin' wild wid us
Tell mommy I'm sorry
This life is a party

[Verse 1]
Remember you was a kid
Reminisce days of the innocence
Now it's Chiddy Bang, google me the images
Follow me, follow me I'm the leader
And when I park cars I don't pay for the meter
I remember I was younger as a kid it was the best
I used touch on all the pretty girls at recess
I'm at my peak yes, I won't leave yet
Serial style, cereal aisle I need chex
I can make these rappers run like a hard drill
Rock band show you how the guitar feel
And I could care less how y'all feel
I got the flow to make a bitch do a cartwheel
This is that good "just puff it and relax, bro"
And you can get it free don't worry 'bout the tax though
And Xaphoon, thank you for the crack
But I play a Ron Burgundy I anchor on the track like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can I please get a little bit of knowledge
Somebody tell Roth that I don't love college
Cause the real world's kinda like Real World
And it's drama so you are Svetlana and I'm just a rhymer
Swimmin' in the water tryin' to dodge the piranhas and fly to Bahamas
Pretty little momma, Chiddy in the spot
Where you at pretty lady show me what you got
They say why you rappin' for the kids for
I said my clothes come fitted, the Lids store
This summer you can catch me on a big tour
I'm high grade, I think they need to quiz more
Let me get wit ya, don't let the kid hit ya
I'm the photo album Voletta has, B.I.G. picture
The rule is, the dude is, so up, so chuck I'm a cool kid

[Hook][Intro: Icona Pop & Chiddy]
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me
(Chiddy Bang)
Ma-ma-manners take a second look and you'll see
(And we pretty much amazing)
There is no one like me (x2)
(Mind your manners)

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
And all the people should be raisin' they glasses
Flow crazy, celebratin' the madness
I never thought I would deliver no classics
Then I hooked up with them and then delivered mo' classics
I be keeping it true, hotel good as long as I could peep on the view
Like, like damn how high are we?
You gotta gamble in this life Charles Barkley
I'm over protected, through the dopest of methods
Now my vocal perfected, this is audio breakfast
Yes, so tell a hater here's the slammer
I know they hatin' on us but mind your manners

[Hook: Icona Pop]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see
There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me
Like me la-la-la-la like me
Ma-ma-manners, you better reconsider
Cause you will never do better
There is no one like me, like me
Like me la-la-la-la like me
(See this is etiquette right here, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-da-ba, ba-ba-da
There is no one like me
There is no one like...

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
So say la, la-la
I arrived, voila
Black-eyed I am, I surprise will.I
And I can't rely on another guy
I was caterpillared into a butterfly!
I’m livin' in the moment, why won't you go and own it?
And we don’t got the spirits, at least we could Coron it
Order sake homie
I be sippin' Ty Ku, and you get the wrong number if I don't like you
Say I'm the man, tell me why I gotta lie too?
Anybody, I'm the best, girl let me advise you
Why?
Because I'm feeling invincible
Junior high school I had a crush on the principal
I guess I was turned on by the leadership
Now we got the game wrapped up on some pita shit
So tell a hater here's a slammer
I know they hatin' on us but mind your manners!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chiddy]
We gon' be here forever man
Chiddy, ugh Xaphoon, Sam
Pretty much 'till they kick me out the booth
And we pretty much amazing

[Hook]

[Outro: Chiddy]
So you could keep searchin' and searchin'
Try and find someone better
How long will that take?
I'll wait[Verse 1]
Everybody's simple then and these niggas is simpletons
Tell them bitches fall back, just like they was limboin'
We still got a Acura but show time we be limoin'
Rest in peace to the dad, bring that white widow in
Chiddy's '90s baby, it ain't gold and shiny baby
She been tryin' to buy me lately
Got a temper tiny baby
Yeah, swelly is just a movement, hope you understand that
Yo, Xaph, it's crazy how we sample on that hand-clap
And that's quite amazing if they ask me
Shit, does somebody have a L that they could pass me?
I upgraded to a little more classy
I guess I got this in the bag, we should have tea
English girls, English girls, shorty said she came in part
To the fact I'm good with words, yeah I got them language arts
Cruisin' by the ocean cause I know this is a game of sharks
Music and money, bet I never let it change my heart

[Hook]
Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party

[Verse 2]
Grind don't stop, I'm on top
Liquor closes 9 o'clock
And they say I'm dripping swell, somebody should find a mop
I be where it's sunny then I'm touring where the climate drops
Watch for police then hit boutiques like it is time to cop
Yeah, I'm just trying to park, so can I find my spot?
Parents complainin' sayin' we don't spend time a lot
I'm super chill, but I think that's just the pot in me
Plus we be feelin' like that movie that they gotta see
So, who hot as me? Take a bitch on a Oddyssey
We just smoke a lot of tree, it's good for the economy
Yeah I'm still up on my grizzly, Mike Conley
That was just a preview, cause they got nothing on we
Fresh whenever comin' out, mixtape laundry
Started off a van, elevated to an R&V
Their competitors got upset that they were doing so well and coming up so quickly, a bit like the crooning in an R&B track
Cause when your shit get in their face it really ain't hard to see

[Hook][Hook]
If you ever see me talking to myself
I'm just, running through the words I have to say to you
Is it over or is it too soon to tell?
I'm just, trying not push myself away from you

[Verse 1]
I know we arguing, I know we fight a lot
You always think I'm wrong, I think I'm right a lot
And when you see me, don't I always make your day?
You from BK but you can't always have it your way
She wanna hit the city, ripping the mall
I always seem to be busy, she expecting my call
The fast life could make us happy, it's upsettin' us all
Cause all the anniversaries, forgettin' 'em all
But don't be mad love, I know it's sad love
She Jolie but it's Pittiful, that's that Brad love
What happens when it all goes wrong, we was nice, generosity
And impossibly enough, it's animosity
I think I gotta just change up my game plan
Cause she ain't down to fall back in love with the same man
But no matter the weather or what the rain bring
At the end I'm coming back for the same thing

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, shorty just vanished on me
She disappeared and yet I do not have no damage on me
Sometimes I feel she's a burden I can't manage on me
She say I'm cocky cause I got all of the cameras on me
But is it my fault, or is it your self-esteem?
That got you feeling like you're a prisoner to my dream
Parents just don't understand, and neither do y'all
You wanna hype me up and leave me there but I don't blue ball
And I say blue ball, just to tell you what them guys will teach you any day
And then you left but fuck it I don't need you anyway
The mentality of love gone wrong, (yeah)
To work it out but we just don't get along, (yeah)
I know it's messed up, we all, affected
Tryin to get through, and the call, rejected
And that has changed, if I was ever close to your fragile frame
I'd be looking for the words, playing Scrabble games

[Hook]

Now everybody say x2
'Round and 'round we go babe
No no no no no, no no
Ooohh, yeah

[Hook x2][Intro]
Late night whippin' it
Late night whippin' it
Late night, late night, late night, late night

[Hook]
Late night whippin' it
We're magnificent
Music bumpin' loud I am not givin' in
Why? Cause I'mma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!)
Yeah, I go hard in the fourth quarter
Great life livin' it
Defense dribble it
I could say you have a chance, I would just be kiddin' then
Why? Cause I'mma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!)
Yeah, I go hard in the
Fourth quarter

[Verse 1]
Uh, call the swelly troops, this is victory
Remember junior high? They used to pick on me
Tell Gaga that I was born this way, became dope
And to the students, I used to be in the same boat
But when we start to pour get your rain coat
We gon' leave every motherfucker here drenched, soaked
And I'm a brainiac and this is swanky rap
Michael Sembello this Chiddy fellow's a maniac
Them haters try to locate whatever plane he's at
Droppin' anvils on him it's Animaniacs
Halftime superstar, fourth quarter legendary
They say that I was droppin' all mixtapes allegedly

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And this is just some fourth quarter antics
Who are you kidding? We be on some grown man shit
Text a chick cause I'm handsome, next we're spittin' at mansion
I bet you this, you ain't next to this
Cause my flow is like a light tantrum
And if you feelin' swelly, this is your anthem
Passport gettin' used up please stamp 'em
Said that shorty in the lobby a dancer
She down to get it? Yes is the obvious answer
I'mma spend this money, make it back
Gettin' first place in fact
Cause we give 'em dope, Xaphoon he could lace the tracks
Baggies is purple and yellow just like a Laker hat
You don't fuck with Chiddy I see you rockin' your hater hat
I finish strong, they don't call me no more
Be the star they adore if you go hard in the four
One time, let the game simmer
I fuck around and hit the game winner

[Hook][Intro]
Yo Xaph, what that say?
I travel all over the place
All over the place
All over the place
I travel all over the place
Aight yo drop that shit, drop it

[Verse 1]
Aloha, bon voyage
Man I be out in Europe then my next stop, Prague
I be everywhere, tell her where you going with your swell ass
To northern Ireland, Chiddy could reign Belfast
Couldn't picture my life ever bein' turtle
Had a show in Wilmington, but we flew out of Myrtle
Yeah and this is my style, numbers that I dial
Know that time is limited I got a lot of sky miles
Hey, for where it's made to get worse
I was working double shifts like an agency nurse
And maybe at first, eggs this guy's overdone
And I hit the slope on them now my rise over run
If I spit that dope on them and my mind is a gun
And I'm waiting to blow, this is what you should know
If you ain't get the picture, understand that there is more to me
Got me throwing my arms around Paris shit, Morrissey

[Hook: Gordon Voidwell]
All over, all over
I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because
All over, all over
Only stone and steel accept my love
I will be back, accept my love
All over, all over
I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because
All over, all over
Only stone and steel accept my love
I will be back, accept my love

[Verse 2]
Different cities for these different days
It's a daze, lately I've been smoking on some different haze
Employers hate the day when you find something different pays
Remember rapping, my parents would tell me it's a phase
Yeah, well I'm sorry it's not
I'm calling the shots I gotta give it all that I got
Yeah, knowledge is power I can't wait to see my mind climb
And so does she, she can't wait to give me Einstein
But she can't call it a quickie
Peanut butter love I be gone in a jiffy
Yeah, see what else do we have but integrity
At which point do you become celebrity?
They want my signature, but I don't write legibly
Allegedly a Monster, can you feel the energy?
Even though I'm about to change latitudes
Never stress and I take it easy nigga with attitude

[Hook][Verse 1]
It started off with a rhyme and a dream
Made it the greatest and the latest, now we fresh on the scene
Got the sample for the kids; won’t you ever grow up?
Went to Drexel and had classes, but I never showed up
I was writing all day 'til my hands would hurt
Professors didn’t appreciate it, called me a jerk
New boy need to learn, but I never would
Pay attention in school is something that I never could, uh
And know with a beat, gotta be steaming
And we could work wonders over logic and reason
We on the hype, now they call it a buzz
And how we get the party popping, Baltimore club, uh
MySpace they could replay next
And you gotta have Xaph for the DJ set
No matter how they ever play us, they can never replace us
And any way you slice it now, homey, they can't take us

[Hook - Sufjan Stevens]
You came to take us, all things go, all things go
To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow
We had our minds set, all things known, all things known
You had to find it, all things go, all things go

[Verse 2]
Say hello to the game, the people know my name
And do they really love us or is this just a fling?
And we be Peter Parker in love with the Mary Jane
So many people gone, so many people came
And, this that brand new spontaneous
Dope flow, intravenous, miscellaneous grinding
Better late than never, I’m calling it perfect timing
But we gon’ have a little bit of fun cause when it’s all done
You throw your sneaks up and call it a good run
I admit, that I would never rather them burn me
I don’t know where I’m headed, but I know it’s a journey
And my bags is packed, so can you hand me my itinerary?
I get attention like a soldier in the military
This is what you gotta notice today
We promise to make sure they never throw us away

[Hook][Hook: ELDee the Don]
I got your back and I'm always gonna hold you down, down
Even though sometimes it seems I'm never around yeah yeah
I'm on the road on tour but I promise I'll be back to you
It's you that I want to see, with you is where I wanna be
Always, Always, Always

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
They gotta love it here
This is something they could bop to
Noah asked me to do it, I said I got to
And, I used to dream about the mean girls
But I had to learn to pay attention in the free world
This life we live is fast so many days have passed
I need my boarding pass
Somebody pour a glass
Shout to The Roots, this is how I got over
I once was a kid somehow I got older
Now I'm deep man somehow I'm heat man
Infactuated with pretty Puerto Ricans
They call me Cubby when they want me, bring the seats in
I'm gonna make this shit fresh for you to eat in
And I'm just a chef in a kitchen, a jet's what we dip in
When we on the side of town
No matter what's next, intermission
It's you that we missin'
You know we gon' hold you down

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
They say we back now
I never back down
First draft and they just made it in the last round
I treat the game like my chick, I'm gon' smash now
I'm at 'em early, no breakfast this shit is hash-browns
They say we go HAM, back to the program
Attending E! are my parties with Lindsay Lohan
They say with this success comes envy, I envy no man
On tracks, I'm barbarian, Conan
And still I'm so seasoned, I feel deepened
I keep that logic so she doesn't need a reason
Nigga half court shot with my eyes closed, heaving
It’s just a dirty game, that’s why I’m a heathen
But literally we making history
The way we twist the tree, the kids quick to see
This is me, I’m on the sixth degree
Doing major on them haters, they just little league
Like that

[Hook]CHORUS (TRAIN):
I hope you know that I’m for real
My love is Super Size, ain’t no Happy Meal
But if I’m gonna stay (Got to wear a glove if we’re gonna make love)
I don’t wanna play
Baby roulette
Baby roulette

VERSE 1:
Yeah uh, we used to get it into college
I ain’t learn shit, but got a lot of knowledge
The snow bunnies had the Ugg, boots with love swoops
You fall in love with them business majors that love suits
But shorties great right? This how we play live
Sent her a message like sign me in on the late night
I know there’s sharks in the water, but fuck a great white
My girl won’t know you said you go Penn State right?
We playing baby roulette
So I delete all the messages I ain’t savin' a text
Next, they can’t wait to hear a player confess
But shortie, you bullshit and remove that layer of dress
Yes, and this is that crazy shit
I think that it is that "I’m gonna have a baby" shit
But you're someone I cannot have a baby with
Just pass the blunt cause baby I ain’t gonna babysit

CHORUS (TRAIN):
I hope you know that I’m for real
My love is Super Size, ain’t no Happy Meal
But if I’m gonna stay (Got to wear a glove if we’re gonna make love)
I don’t wanna play
Baby roulette (yeah it’s like)
Baby roulette

VERSE 2:
Yeah uh, and maybe it’s the way I’m loving her lady lips
Part time waitress chick saving tips
And I’m still up on some Pretty Much Amazing shit
So roll a window up, baby we finna take this hit
We on the top floor, that’s what the game bring
My love is Super Sized, and I’mma let Train sing
And could we chill what we do is what you assume
Late night I just hit, but her roommate was in the room
Like damn, could we do this every weekend?
The baddest chicks on campus, I need them
And I don’t hate the women, so I’m prepared for love
But if we make it then of course I’m gonna wear a glove
I’m your savior, I’mma text you when I can
She falling for me, so I’m gonna catch her when I can
And when I call you we back on, loving you with the strap on
A bald head in the winter, I keeps my hat on

CHORUS (TRAIN):
I hope you know that I’m for real
My love is Super Size, ain’t no Happy Meal
But if I’m gonna stay (Got to wear glove if we’re gonna make love)
I don’t wanna play
Baby roulette
Baby roulette[Chiddy:]
Darwin Deez, Theodore Grams, yeah

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

[Chiddy:]
That's right, uh

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
We used to be so strong
Back then we was right, now we so wrong
She was Beyonce, I could've got my Hov on
And when she hang up on me, I tell her hold on
Quit that shit, I don't use force
Today is a bad day, we've been divorced
When I think about stress, I don't really need it
But this is plagiarism, cause my shortie just cheated
And shortie conceited
(She out of her mind, I wish she had Louis and a card in decline)
She had school with no aid, no HIV
Hope you don't get in the club with that fake ID
Why would you hurt somebody that you called your man for?
And I hope you get evicted by your landlord
But, she be messin' with me
And I'm hoping she lose my number indefinitely
So

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

THEODORE GRAMS:
I guess you can't remember all the times that I was there
Your emotions on a roller coaster, no fun fair
You had me on the phone, but hate me when I come there
Xaphoon, let's cut it down to a drum snare
Yeah, yeah, just like that
I hope I hope you go deaf so you can't hear shit
Yeah, I hope I hope you go blind
Cause you look me in the face and you laugh when I cry

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Maybe you should wonder why your apartment is always so empty
(Maybe you should wonder that)
Well I hope you get locked out of that apartment and have to call Jenny
(Ohh, I hope you get locked out)

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Cause everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
She's way too complex
When we argue, she takin' shit out of context
And, I know I could have did more
But I'm never home, I was always on tour
I could be anywhere in the world, had one wish
To be with you until you gave that dude a tongue kiss
And this is hard for me to say like a tongue twist
My heart don't beat for you so let the drum hit
And, you know I just got promoted
Now I be the boss and I hope you get demoted
Hapiness is a warm gun, live it fully loaded
And shit got worse when I exploded
Boom, I wrote it soon, I hope you brought a cab pay
And I hope you get detention on a half day
I wish I could use your blouse for an ashtray
Cause for you, everyday should be a bad day

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

[Chiddy:]
Xaphoon you crazy
But so am I

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
And that's the way it is
You wanna soar, but your wings don't work
The kids want somebody to believe in
Heathens get love for no reason
Regular folks do regular things
People like this or people like that
All I wanna do is take the ching
And I'll be M.I.A. on top of the track
But let me give you the facts
We be getting the paper
Let me give you the facts
Earthquake bars, yeah you know I spit crack
The boy off the wall, get rid of the thumb tack
About to take the game and I'll never give it back
But, but, the hate is contagious
They tamper, they just like the raises
I'm Motorola, I'm just like the RAZRs
Cause the swag show you the new craze is
I think I need to see some new faces
She got a fatty, I'm gonna squeeze toothpaste it
Top floor yeah, think I might move in
Ivy League writing, tell me what you pen
I am exciting, this is confusion
I'm all about my money, I didn't mean to bring Scrooge in
Please check out my melody, I'm heavenly, don't tell on me, I'm puffing on celery
Hills like Beverly, the houses, the case come settle me
The waves keep spinning, propellin' me
I pay, keep grinning, so bet on me
And then you gon' see that I am the best because

[Hook: Thom Yorke (Sample of "Reckoner") & Chiddy Bang]
Because we separate like
Ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate like (Because, because, don't worry, that's what passion does, don't worry, just pass the bud)
Ripples on a blank shore (Let it ripple like I pass the flood and if I fall to the ground, I'm bouncin' back up, try to bring me down, I'm bouncin' back up, haters all around, we bouncin' back up, bouncin' back up)

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
I bounce up, you dummy
Told you I would have this thing wrapped, you mummy
I'm a vacuum, honey, cause I'm here to clean it up
And this is my Dizm, so tell him beam me up
Like my Chevy sits so high up in the sky
Not Arabic, but Qatar on my feet, Dubai
You recognize a bit of that floss talk
I recognize a bit of that buzz talk
Cocaine bars on speakers
Dream about the day that I charge on features
Yeah, before I get to tomorrow, got to conquer today
Will I live to tomorrow? Question I ask today
Tell me what I can pay, models chicks is all
And a bag of chips, so let me know if I am Frito Lay
Hear the people say the same thing the preachers say
When they hear me spit, tell 'em to pray for me anyway
I'm a monster inside of this cage and I can't record tracks
As quick I can fill the page, guess what I figure they feel the rage
Career suicide, they jumping off the stage
One by one, they all fall down like toy soldiers
You ain't taking the bread
Ain't it funny, we was made to be dead?
So I live it through the music, I'm a RADIOHEAD

[Hook: Thom Yorke (Sample of "Reckoner") & Chiddy Bang][Verse 1]
Yeah, getting high's in my regiment
I said clear they have a speech impediment
I'm with a very posh girl that's elegant
How do you dumb it down when you highly intelligent
I'm finna based the flow, give 'em a rare move
Ground humble but fly and I'm eatin' air food
Nigerian American, moments I'm cherishing
Hear that weak shit and there's no comparison
But could I ever be next to be Nas?
Haters is spying on me, I don't fuck with espionage
Life's a bitch, she could be ugly as sexy Minaj
The Recipe's odds and most never would less of be Oz, yeah
Uh, I'm feeling flyer than I've ever been
Flyer than 'em cause we flying where they've never been
Yeah, still feeling incredible
I got that good health, smoking on medical

[Hook]
Look at what you made us do
Early morning shit, this what you wake up to
Uh, they can't fade us too
Matter fact, look at what you made us do
Yeah, look at what you made us do
Early morning shit, this what you wake up to
Uh, they can't fade us too
Matter fact, look at what you made us do
Let's have breakfast!
Yeah, yeah, it's time to have breakfast!
Uh, and I'mma do the same
'Bout to tell 'em have breakfast
So get your plate, get your fork, get your spoon
Yeah, it's time to have breakfast
Yeah, and it's reckless!

[Verse 2]
Hey yo the flow is OK
And I'm serving up breakfast, you know it goes with OJ
I don't care about haters I'm what your hoes finna play
And my train of thought's making me tell a soul sister "hey"
Yeah, she's on another level, and I am impressed
But she might just be a devil in a new dress
I got 'em hatin', waitin' what I'mma do next
Chicks let me slam 'em like wrestlers I can suplex
Too fake, but really I say I'm too fresh
I don't even sweat her but I bet she give my crew neck
Yeah, uh, I'm just swellin' on 'em
I don't hear 'em yeah I'm bout to go Hellen on 'em
Get the BasedGod, call Ellen on 'em
We give it to 'em for cheaper, we wholesellin' on 'em
I hit the chick and then I probably won't care after
They think they steppin' up, they are on the StairMaster

[Hook]
Look at what you made us do
Early morning shit, this what you wake up to
Uh, they can't fade us too
Matter fact, look at what you made us do
Yeah, look at what you made us do
Early morning shit, this what you wake up to
Uh, they can't fade us too
Matter fact, look at what you made us do
Lets have breakfast!
Yeah, yeah, it's time to have breakfast!
Uh, and I'mma do the same
'Bout to tell 'em have breakfast
So get your plate, get your fork, get your spoon
Yeah, it's time to have breakfast
Yeah, and it's reckless![Verse 1: Chiddy]
When the bass knock, the beat so hard
Got the 808 drum to make your face knot
Other rappers they chill, but we still flow ill
Got the shit to make you rock like Aesop
We gon' stay hot, that's forever and ever
Like to vacate where the weather is better
Flyer than a bird, we ain't on the same feather
Track number two: Never
We onto new things
This the type of jam to get loose with
And when they play us on the radio, "Who's this?"
Change the rules, throw away the rubric
And if you hatin' you can only be useless
Hell'a smoke when we be ride, straight Snoop shit
And I ain't never told a lie
See the truth is that we do this to the snare
Live from the home of the Prince of Bel-Air
Well, if you ain't got it then it's straight welfare
And you can tell we're
Above and beyond
Pro, James Bond
And this fly shit is a part of me
And don't I keep it flowing like a artery
Take cash, dreams never shatter
We ain't step it up
We just raised up the ladder
Gaze at us when we race past
Brand new Chiddy with the Ms. Kate Nash
Yeah

[Hook: Kate Nash]
Skeleton, you are my friend
But you are made of bone
And you have got no flesh and blood
Running through you to help protect the bone
Skeleton, we have been friends for years
And you have seen me through some trials
And tribulations and some tears
But everybody thinks I'm weird

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
Yeah, me too
Keep a bad chick right near me, too
Can you hear me, do
You understand
The words comin' out of my mouth
Swelly no doubt
Probably in a row by the exit
Reckless on a plane eating breakfast
Not a SAT, so don't test this
Your favorite rapper cool, but we be on some next shit
Calamari, I'm sorry we got the best food
I'm in the lab and the beat is like a test tube
From where it's hotter than a sauna
If you are arriving then you're probably a goner
Yeah they may ball, but they're probably Juwanna
And whenever I am off, then I'll probably be on her
I get to zonin and then I zone off
For this fly shit you gotta cut your phone off
Phone lost, high at the telegan
This is not a freestyle it's a skeleton
Skinny rapper in the room, I'm a elephant
Stay clear of all the birds and the pelicans
Shake the bass and then we take the place
All swell, Carvel, this takes the cake
F Jakes the snakes
Push him down the stairwell
And this is live from the pilot, Air Swell

[Outro: Kate Nash]
And I should have known
That it wouldn't be long until you
You've got me standing in an awkward position[Verse 1]
Sit back and just breathe
Sit back, everything we did that once we twist that
We gon' get so high like where a blimp at
I wrestle with these niggas
We bringing them total impact
I am that, I even sing with my vocal intact
Somethings missing when there’s no food up in the fridge
Auntie just came over so you know she brought the kids
And thinking bout my homies, man I love them and I miss them
Crazy how your moms used to struggle with addiction
New money motherfuck government assistance
We gonna keep itchin', we gonna keep inching
Closer to they dreams, holsters in they jeans
If Dennis doing time, how he suppose to raise a queen
Just a question I'm asking
We already been trappin, need the whole pie
Never the fraction, forever we stacking
Earthquakes, they shake but don’t bleed
Sit back and just breathe

[Hook]
All the roads we walk (All the roads we walk)
All the friends that we meet (All the friends that we meet)
Gotta keep your head up (Gotta keep your head up)
Sit back and just breathe (Sit back and just breathe)
All the things we see (All the things we see)
Living life on the street (Living life on the street)
Gotta keep your head up (Gotta keep your head up)
Sit back and just breathe (Sit back and just breathe)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, ain’t nothing changing ya
Jersey boy switched up, moved to Pennsylvania
And he hopped on a train and went to Philly
Young niggas was wildin' in the city acting silly
Moves that I’m making when I was in high school
Found an application and I’m trying to rhyme too
And I’m trying to shine too, haters like the swine flu
Can’t see it but what it is til it’s behind you
Few of them accepted me but most of them rejected me
Then something got the best of me
Telling me to invest in me
So then I search like how I’m gonna get it though
Four years of my life, don’t wanna be miserable
Fuck it chose Drexel, now they trying to sue me though
Only real reason that I went was for the studio
Yo, not to mention gotta pay for the housing
But that shit cost 35 thousand, Damn

[Hook]

[Outro]
All the roads we walk
All the friends that we meet
You gotta keep your head up
Sit back and just breathe
All the things we see
Living life on the street
Sit back and just breathe[Hook]
I'll always be by your side
I'll always be by your side

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this right here is for all of the chicks right here
That knew how to sing my shit right here
The love that I'm sharing you have no idea
And they are too swelly, all seem ready
"When you 'gon come to my town already?"
Tell 'em in no time, have to grow time
Last year I had loans with a co-sign
Honeys say, "Chiddy you are out of yo mind"
Once I get the green like it's go time
And my outlook positive, pro time
But these niggas so soup like wontons
For the girls that be chillin' all really
Smoke a little bit, they be feelin' all silly
Bring ya tight shit, she a duchess
Tell her bring Dutches and she the one rollin' on Philly
She a pothead, buy her own trees she got bread
We happy and we single and we colored
But, bang bang bang like Pop said
I could get that 2Pac bread, not dead
But tellin' them girls to keep their head up
Know you got the nice ship, know you so fed-up
When I'm in your city I promise we might get up
So don't trouble me, get two cars that's double V's
I'm in the hotel on the top floor
She come through and we'll smoke double tree
Love will see
She comes first, then I arrive
Sunshine, this little light of mine
February 14th Valentine
And Chiddy always gon' be by your side, by your side

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, she's the leader of my fan club
So I show her damn love
It don't really matter if she with you
She always gon' show her man love
Lovin' how she dress so nicely
And the shit she rock oh so pricey
Had to cut her man out cause he ain't have swells
She sayin' he was tryin' to be like me
I said damn, damn, many me's
We deserve to get a Emmy please
So let me roll up my Fendi sleeves
While she roll up those Cali trees
She's got all my tees, that's Chiddy merchandise
I gave her swelly shorts and she work 'em right
Head to the back, head to the clouds
Although we keep it quiet, we blowin' all out
Home-style raps just to make my mom proud
Please don't turn me off, tell your friend we on now
We gone now, old school kickin' in rolled chains
I tell her let me sign on
And then she tellin' me "Go daddy" and then I log on
The domain, so vain
She could come aboard this motherfuckin' Soul Train
And I spit the new shit, then you gettin' stupid
When you give me your whole brain, oh mayne
I oblige, shorty come through when I arrive
I give her the feeling like when you high and dry
And I'mma always be by your side, by your side

[Hook][Verse 1]
Can I take a picture and ask for the permission?
And you don’t really have to, homie it’s your decision
So nervous, showing your friends is the only purpose
And you just wanted something that would make it all worth it
Well here’s a ticket, I would gladly oblige
You saw me from afar so a scheme you had to devise
And I said baby you fine, had some things on my mind
You slip me your number, said call me at a moment in time
Don’t mind if I do, hashtag time is money
So I’m focused on putting some extra paper in my cashbag
If I was broke bummy, that would be inadequate
But if they trying to get swelly, then I’m the advocate
Shit it’s a piece of cake, oven full easy bake
Used to steal my brother’s carD, now I’m not gon’ need a fake
It’s Peanut Butter And Swell
We just living in the moment if you can’t tell

[Hook: Matt and Kim]
No time for cameras
We’ll use our eyes instead
No time for cameras
We’ll be gone when we’re dead
No time for cameras
We’ll use our eyes instead
I see flashes of gold

[Verse 2]
Ayo the cameras was ill, that was a great look
If I accept you, please don’t tag me on Facebook
I know you trying to be personable
But you don’t gotta hit the tag to feel personal
Yeah these days, pussy, money, weed, need three things
Shit I’m prepared to grapple with whatever these brings
Spazzing on tracks at home, on calm things
And planning getaway dates with your girl in Palm Springs
But that’s neither here nor there, we be flying everywhere
Yeah I am the pilot of the newly launched Swelly Air
And what city are we headed to and where’s the telly there?
We gon’ need some dutches there, we gon’ hit the deli there
That’s if you’re wondering, fanfare humbling
I be on my Twitter shit, she be on Tumbling
And it’s fine Matt & Kim, this is just a sample I
Ripping the stages then dealing with all the camera time

[Hook: Matt and Kim]
No time for cameras
We’ll use our eyes instead
No time for cameras
We’ll be gone when we’re dead
No time for cameras
We’ll use our eyes instead
I see flashes of goldCan I rock to this rhyme?
You're not on my mind
They say we blowing up
Don't jump on a mine

I once had a time
To the world I was blind
Now I see everything
Through these contacts of mine

I'm at the office yeah
I does it again
I touch it, it wins
That why the label buzzin' me in, uh

Tell my momma I won't stop 'til I'm signed
I'm hot with the ryme
You Megatron, I'm Optimus Prime

I'm locked in a line
I'm just waiting for my turn
Still fresh as def'
So this paper I gotta earn

I ain't Stern
David commision me for athleticism
The prototype on the mic
Just check my mechanism

And they ask how you make the world feel it?
I say it's DNA, It's just in my double helix

Controversey sells
Controversey sells

And I'mma take this line
To the Presidential hill

Not Barack, though I love ya
You in a lower weight class
I'm above ya

Can I get this?
Guarantee I spit this
Hand on the stand
I guarantee you should witness, yeah

The boy back like retro
I want my car to have NOS like Esco
I'm in a class, in the corner
I'm special

The flow's magic, magic, presto
I take off before, and I break off
Perfect attendance
I'm never taking days off

And while I put in work
And they getting a lay off
And this is based off

Flow

I'm feelin like I'm near cash
On drive, so I steer fast
Don't they feel my impact like a deer crash?

Promise I tear
If I wait, you see it's frontin'
Make the rain go away
Like a windshield wipe

I'm right, I'm wrong

A big enough heart
To give a hater a hug

Shooting off
Whether it's grenades or a slug
Still bees, honey bees, designated by bugs

What?[Hook: The Knocks]
We don’t care
We don’t care
We don’t care if the sun comes up
We don’t care if the sun comes up
We don’t care if the sun comes up
Cause you know we’ll be dancing with the DJ
We don’t care if the sun comes up
Cause you know we’ll be dancing with the DJ
Come tonight, I’m gonna find your love
And we can have a party just the two of us yeah

[Intro: Chiddy]
Praises be
To the almighty Xaphoon Jones, The Knocks, Chiddy

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
She came to dance insane, to go
To a level that I never ever seen before
Start this, small kiss, that’s lean the walk
Tell the dike I'd turn her like Tina though
And I seen the glow in your eyes
Give me them wings, give me them thighs
High in the penthouse we can just rise
Told her I’m a star and I’m up in these skies
Enough of these guys, talking how they really gonna do it
You try and get the Benz, they try and get the Buick
So come in girl, I'm where you gotta be
And I’m one in a million, no lottery
I got game that’s EA proof
And she told me to come over by the DJ booth
I’m in the DJ booth, I rock PJs loose
I want that Absolut power and I don’t mean Grey Goose
I got it

[Hook: The Knocks]
We don’t care if the sun comes up
We don’t care if the sun comes up
We don’t care if the sun comes up
Cause you know we’ll be dancing with the DJ
We don’t care if the sun comes up
Cause you know we’ll be dancing with the DJ
Come tonight, I’m gonna find your love
And we can have a party just the two of us yeah

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
So try to dance to this, and find ‘mance to this
And later on when you try and find cannabis
Like 'em all, but I'm crushin' on tanner chicks
And they always just want gifts on some Santa shit
Seen one of those that night, she had her back right
She had the leggings that killed it up in the black tights
And I’m never slipping, even on black ice
I’m in the front so they always try and back bite
But anyway, back to you
And I think you got a good sense of fashion too
Your man cool but you need a little passion too
Made a Mountain out of nothin', bitch pass the Dew
I’m just trying to catch breeze like a pass from Drew
Sip a couple sangrias if I happen to
Girl we gotta get ghost and she say poof
Then she started goin' over to the DJ booth now that's wild

[Hook: The Knocks]

[Outro: Chiddy]
We can just keep goin'
We can just keep goin'
Uh, we gonna be here all night, I swear
Still make it in time for Breakfast[Intro]

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:
Welcome to the New York Port Authority. Exits are in the back, on the left and right

[Hook: Chiddy Bang]
You know me, I’m a upscale character
Haters, we ain’t mad at ya
To the penthouse we go
It’s time to grind now, so we gotta shine now
Never take a time out
Leave ‘em in the danger zone
You know me, I’m a upscale character
There is not a challenger
To the front page we go
It’s time to grind now, so we gotta shine now
Never take a time out
Now you’re in the danger zone

[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
They in the danger zone
I’m in a major zone
They stereotype me
They thought my name Jerome
Because my skin is dark, I witness art
Watch me as I come up from the bottom
And ascend the charts, and then I spark
I play this right
Fork in the road, I made a right
Try to take off while them haters just delay the flight
I know you watchin’ me
Them other boys sloppy
My flow is dead on
Now where’s the autopsy?
Whores watch me, say hello to my stainless
Got my hand in the cookie jar, visions of being famous, I’m saying

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
Yeah, my composition is remarkable
I am a molecule
They are just a particle
And this a article
So you can read all about it
And are they messing with us? I doubt it
The road less traveled
I’m sorry I’ll reroute it
And this goes out to everyone
That shot me down and doubted
Now I’m cumulusly clouded
Serious, higher than a Nimbus
I swear, I’m on the scene like forensics
Just check the stylo
We know heat flow
Them A&Rs tryin’ to find me like Nemo, I mean it


[Hook]

[Outro]
Xaphoon, you crazy![Introduction]
PSA: Now arriving in Philadelphia, the last stop. Thank you for riding the Swelly Express
Chiddy: Damn, yo I just woke up son. That was the craziest dream ever dawg. Black Thought came through and gave us some advice and got on the track. Some Hollywood shit

[Verse 1]
They waitin’ for that decline
Pray that I lose my mind, they never want me to shine
But I observe that, trouble I will serve that
Ear to the streets, never will I give the curve back
Still movin’ at a velocity
Still sensing the animosity
Hate mail is what they send me
But I separate letters like an apostrophe
Colossally, didn’t come the same must of had two angles
He was isosceles, but now I’m Socrates
With philosophies
I’m in my tree house please don’t bother me
And now it’s lookin’ like hella smoke
Under age they lettin’ me pass the velvet rope
And this life getting reckless
Feeling like a lone star, Texas

[Hook]
Uh huh I know what’s on your mind
You don’t think were gonna shine
I face you to prove you wrong
Thought I was weak I tell you I am getting strong
This time its gonna be different than the last time
I swear I’m gonna turn this from a hobby and a pastime
Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah)
This will wash the pain away

[Verse 2]
Could you cheer for me when you see me?
Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me
But, you see I need it for the cake I go
Like Today on the TV and the radio
Retro ’80 flow, hood make it crazy though
Puttin’ work with music but the school made me lazy though
Why cause I couldn’t write enough rhymes
They say that hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs
Never trippin’, I’m on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses, a young Nickel-Nine
See, now tell me would ya get me wrong
If I told you in the studio I met Solange?
If I said I command it like its the Pentagon
Hatin’ on even on the roof I’m upper echelon
But still forever we shine
Turn a negative to positive I never decline

[Hook][INTRO]

[Verse 1]
Is he moving too fast? Is she moving too slow?
She telling me that I'm silly, but I'm only 2-0
And it sucks that she just want to be friends with me
I try to put her on where I'm at mentally
I'm full of energy
At times I need a remedy
For lack of things that interest me
But still her body is tempting me
She just keep rejecting me
Why she keep stressing me?
Screaming like "Don't touch me bitch, I don't got leprosy"
Maybe we wasn't meant to be
But I was down Bonnaroo, Tennessee
In the RV, I can shut down a stage
Casey had the veggies on the bus, we smoked a pound of haze
Digress the tree can cold stress
When you feeling a bad bitch, but she showing you no interest
Sending letters with no address
And she never gon' get it so let it rest

[Hook x2]
Does she love me?
No sir
Does she want me?
No sir
I think she hates me
What has she done for me lately?

[Verse 2]
I'm high with no intent to land
I seem to fall for the girls with the short attention spans
Who just wanna rendezvous
I would take her on a date, to a nice restaurant
But I got too much on my plate
Said I'm here for a day
She hit me three hours late
Found out I left the city, bet she had the sour face
Told her I would kick it with her whenever I return
But that was based on the premise that she was my concern
Searching for serious, life
Then I was fast
Had me speeding on this racetrack, furious
The kinda chick, the flyest nigga in the school he had her
But eff that, I'm trying to focus on what truly matters
I like em usually bad, always on punishment
Having a conversation, wishing I could punish it
And why the fantasy so far from the truth, huh?
Running in circles playing Duck, Duck, Goose, huh?
We take the shit any slower, then we gonna hold up traffic
Only hit the blunt once, then she fuckin' pass it
I knew we wasn't compatible
Quarterback my feelings to the side, that's a lateral
I wish that I could be satisfied
I wish you would let me have a try
But there's a problem with you and I
Now its Chi-town, do or die

[Hook][Skit]
"Alright guys, good shit today at the label. I think it went well."
"Yo, I’m tired as hell."
"Yeah, well we got a long ass ride home so try to get some sleep on the bus."
"We’ll try to."
"We got a show tomorrow so make sure you get that rest, alright? Before you miss that bus, the last one tonight. Try not to sleep at my house."

[Verse 1]
Ay, check the plans out
We work hard, I ain’t asking for a handout
If I hit the booth, I don’t have to pass the grams out
And be the well when the other thoughts ran out
They say they lost words. I got them puzzled like the cross-word
Harvard, I’m nuts George Washington Carver
But you can never pay a boss peanuts
If it gets messy be prepared for the cleanup
But this thing called success is so strange
Because you can get notoriety and still ride the train
Make it in its entirety and search for the fame
But I’m still Michael Phelps: swimming in my lane
Where’s Lois? Me, I’m Superman here to save the day
Or at least I thought I was, til I
Flew in to save her and I met my opponent
I’m fighting with myself, don’t offer the condolence
I’m dreaming

[Hook]
We chasing the dream
So what is life? The diamonds and the gleam
Get a job while I’m doing it, promise to stay true in it
Doing it, but never let another soul ruin it
And things ain’t what it seem
Make money to spend it, I got my scheme
Work hard while we doing it, promise to stay true to it
Doing it, but never let another soul ruin it

[Verse 2]
It's too haunting, the task is daunting
Trying to get the labels on board while flaunting
But let’s make some music, make some money, get the rides
European ties, have models for wives
Sometimes I feel fated to pretend
Unsafe, cause my crib is far from gated in
I’m a relic, believe slightly the psychedelic
If I could take off, would you consider me angelic?
Hysteric, I’m the subject and the predicate
They hating on me, tell me where’s the etiquette
If you Goliath, I don’t need to prove I’m better than
I play David, I’m a fourth year letter man
So Letterman, can’t you hear me knocking on the door
Hard to breathe at this altitude where oxygen is poor
Think Benz, I don’t know what Pontiac means
And this is what happens when an insomniac dreams

[Hook]This girl is so hot
It’s an emergency
Let’s go girl straight to the crib

Hear me click ok 911
I am looking for a chick I am gonna find me some
Time has come she has got a gold medal
I see you in your high heel shoes stilettos
Tell me where you go mommy keep a bad chick that’s right for some
And I smoke tree so please don’t loud me
What I mean is what I said take a few high …
Case your body so good run my .. so good
Seen a video she is a real like … run in a fast lane she might …
Clap man you can .. like .. but you got to be willing

So take a sip of this
You know it’s real good
Move your body know it feels good
Turn your … I know they like that … I will be right back
Emergency
Emergency

Emergency

We get it all so go dance

Shorty wanna roll with me with no man
Back to the program spend it out shorty bend it out
Hey yo can we get into the house
Emergency are you hearing me
And shorty on fire and a third degree
She like me we like trees and rain on it

Said I got to keep it .. like …go girl you can get it if she like me
We like .. we said we need id but really do you head it to the vip
More money more problems .. get it how you live in the vip

Chorus
So take a sip of this

Move your body know it feels good
Turn your … I know they like that … I will be right back
Emergency
Emergency

Emergency(Chorus)
Sleeping through the day
Wake up with champagne roll me a (ay)
I told my mother I would quit
What can I say
I'm still breathing
Falling in love every evening
So we just gonna stay
Teenage dreamers born this way
I told my mother I'd grow up
What can I say
I'm still breathing
Falling in love every evening

(Verse 1)
Now I'm feeling young
I'm staying out late like its never been done
I'm using my heart like I got nothing to lose
Like I've been handed the keys to every door that I choose
We throw off our clothes and we jump in the pool
And every emotion is feeling like new
And we're on the posters and we're on the news
But we wouldn't care if they never knew
Our skin is burning we're up on the roof
We've been here for days and I can't find my shoes
I can't find my cell and I can't find my girl
And I wouldn't wanna be anywhere in the world

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Now I'm feeling high
We're driving fast now like we'll never die
Pulling me close now her pupils are wide
And I see the future when I look in the sky
Its giving me goosebumps the permanent kind
Our bellies are warm now I think I can fly
We sit on the beach and she looks in my eyes
Tells me I'm crazy and I tell her she's right
I feel amazing we're pulling the blinds
Pouring the champagne and painting the night
Listening loud now to diamonds and pearls
And I wouldn't wanna be anywhere in the world

(Chorus)

[Refrain]
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
Open your eyes open wide
Watch the city come to life

(Chorus)
