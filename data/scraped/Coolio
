[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda g that little homie's wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the street light

[Hook 1: LV]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set tripping banger
And my homies are down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothing but a heart beat away
I'm living life do or die, what can I say
I'm twenty-three now, will I ever live to see twenty-four
The way things is going I don't know

[Hook 2: LV]
Tell me why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!

[Hook 1] + [Hook 2] (x2)[Verse 1]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kind of G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

[Hook: L.V.]
We've been spending most our lives
Livin' in the Gangsta's Paradise
(repeat)
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in the Gangsta's Paradise

[Verse 2]
Look at the situation, they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street

I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye

And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die-a, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-fo'?
The way things is goin' I don't know

[Bridge: L.V.]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I got to learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is outta luck, fool

[Hook]

[Outro: L.V.]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

{*choir sings until the end*}[Coolio]
Greeting, earthlings
We have now taken over your radio

[B-Real]
Going straight to the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breaking ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew taking all control
You can't get none of this, we're running this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this
Get out the lane, I'm coming through
And if you don't wanna move then I'm coming right through you

[Coolio]
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now your whole crew is dust
Coming through my area, I'mma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?

Chorus:
[B-Real]
We want it all (want it all!)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor!)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore!)
In the game we take you to war (war!)
You ain't seen nothing like this before
[All]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

[Method Man]
Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Megalomaniacal monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep coming down like rain
You feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger, you're dealing with offical hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk

[LL Cool J]
Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessing and moves is animated
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is getting money
When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies (Uhh!)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (Uhhh!)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money?
Or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay
Lounging in the mothership back around my way (Uhh!)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I getting lyrical?
Daddy, I think so
Monstar dropping flavor fluid so drink slow

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, God bless!!
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed balling, on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off!!
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock!!
I'm starting a line-up by getting y'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be?
They be the Monstars!

[Hook][Hook]
1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

[Verse 1]
What up everybody, so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention

Now I wanst to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk

When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know

1 2 3, it's like A B C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you got beefed, then nigga eat a porkchop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I break like dandylocks, panties drop
From hood to hood, block to block

Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night

My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a jerry curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on, now whatcha gonna do, so

Grab your partner, do se do
If you don't know who it is, it's Coolio
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

[Hook]

Rhyme 3:
Push, push, in the bush
But don't step on my toes cuz you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre

Comin' at 'em with pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip cuz I don't want to have to gat 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy
The way you shake that ass, always amaze me

Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give the nigga his props

I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

[Hook extended] fade out[Intro]
Aww here it goes

[Verse 1: Coolio]
Everybody out there go run and tell
Your homeboys and home girls it's time for Kenan and Kel
They keep you laughing in the afternoon
So, don't touch that dial or leave the room
'Coz they're always into something
It's fun and you don't wanna miss it
It's double K, like 2 the good radius
Kenan and Kel or should I say Kel and Kenan
But you gotta watch Kenan 'coz
Kenan be scheming
With a plan or a plot
To make it to the top
But they kinda in the middle
'Coz they're always gettin' caught
This ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery
It's just Kenan and Kel in your vicinity
Like Seigfried and Roy, Abbott and Costello
Magic and Kareem, or Penn and Teller
Somebody's in trouble

Aww here goes
On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Nick[Intro: Easy Mo Bee]
{*scratching*}
"Go for mine,  and run down the line"
{*scratching*}
"Go for mine, and run down the line"

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Roley (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, "Holy moley!"
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lone, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

Break 1: Easy Mo Bee

(Verse 2)
[Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical BUCK BUCK, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Ill Al Skratch]
Aiyyo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy with stakes

[Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fatal when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fucking final call

Hook: Ill Al Skratch
It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

Break 2: Easy Mo Bee
"For my one true"
"Our run's our rhyme"
"For my one"
{*scratching*}
"One true"
"For my one true"
"Our run"
"Our run"
"Run's"
"Our"
"Rhyme"

(Verse 3)
[Busta Rhymes]
Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You best believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, "Please give me room, yo step aside"
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
"Yo, throw the wax on" "How many emcees must get dissed"

[Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pave, ending 'em meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Wish Bone]
Living the psycho path so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once a
Gain enough to pick a defender
They try to contend us, see, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother, while smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, wit, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up, get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up[Verse One: Coolio]
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinkin
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin and smokin
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

[Hook]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Verse Two: Lek Ratt - 40 Thevz]
More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta lay the struggle
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag colour, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'mma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there with muted sounds bumpin

[Hook]

[Verse Three: PS - 40 Thevz]
You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

[Hook]

[Outro: Coolio]
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

[Hook] - to fade[Hook]

[Hook extended] fade outWe meet every single day at the same old place
At the same old time
With the same state of mind
Me and her together but we know it ain't forever
We just happy for the time
The weed and the wine
The walks in the park, escapades in the dark
We knew how it had to be right
From the very start coz
I got obligations and she's in the situation
That she came to state, so this is our fate
Holding hands, a smile, a glimpse
A kiss and a dance but we can't take a chance on
Gettin caught
So we stick to a plan coz
We both got another and they wouldn't understand it
Me and Mrs Jones have a thing going on
I wouldn't call it love but it damn sure strong
It ain't about doin' dirt
Or living like a flirt
But what they don't know don't hurt
Me and Mrs Jones

-Chorus-

Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones

The very first time I met her I
Saw her from across the room
And just when we be both but can't consume
By the thought
Of she and I being together so I
Headed in her direction for some closer inspection
I intentionally brushed her hand her
Skin had a satin touch
The feeling she gave me was
More than I could measure and
Right away I
Knew I had to have her with me
If not with me then maybe just to hit me
She got ten point skill and percision in the walk
And the way that she talk
Make my mouth turn to chalk
She give me everything that I don't get at home
And it seems like I'm a man coz her's is always gone, now
Tell me what love got to do with it
No coz we both feel good when we kickin' it
Some might say that I'm    and should leave her alone
But me and Mrs Jones got a thang goin' on

-Chorus-

Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones

It's been about a year since we've been seeing eachother
And we're a whole lot more than just part time lovers
Coz when I got a problem she do everything she can to solve 'em
But her life is not revolved around how revolving
I'm the Shaka Zulu and she's my fantasie, but
Deep down inside we know that we can never be
Any more than what we are, a phone call in the car
Bite to eat, with a movie and a drink at the bar
When all of a sudden right out of the blue my
Ladie got a clue on
What what we was up to and
Wait a minute, damn
From what I understand
It seems that my woman's been talking to her man
Since we both in love with the people at home
It looks like, we just gone have to leave it alone
Coz I got a woman and she got a man so
That's how it goes, and that's how it is

-Chorus-

Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
[We had a thang goin']
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
[We got a thing going on]
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones, oh yeah
We used to meet at the same place
Same time
Used to sit and talk it over
[We got a thing going on]
Talk it over
Me and Mrs Jones, Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones[Intro]

Aww here goes
On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, NickBack in the days when I was a young buck
Stuck like a truck gettin shit outta luck
Times was rough and I didn't have a plan
I was barely on the edge of my life as a man
It's really fucked up when there's dope in the crib
No food in the kitchen for the motherfuckin kids
That's why a young nigga learned how to steal,see
Shoplifting maid me a whole lotta meals
But I remember days when the cupboard was bare and
Life was unfair but who the fuck cares?
I still hear Momma,what she used to tell me
That you don't get shit in this life for free
And even if I never ever make it to the mountain top
Fuck it!I fight for my hip-hop
Not everybody can relate to what I been through
Even though some front and they try to pretend to
Know about the life of a kid and the strife
Where he has to live in the shadow of a base-pipe
Good goes to bad,bad goes to worse
And pretty soon he's stealin from his own Momma's purse
So clean out ya ears and open up your eyes
I reach out to touch but somebody moved the sky
My stomach is growlin,word is born
Cos all I had for dinner was a can-o-corn

BRIDGE
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
All I had for dinner was a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
Before I went to school I had a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
I tried to get full off a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
That's all the fuck that we had in the kitchen

A few years later,I pledge allegiance to the set
I'm growin up but I ain't grown yet
It's funny how the strain in a life filled with pain
Can sometimes leave a bitch stained on the brain
I'm sittin in the restaurant,guardin my food like a eagle
Pickin up scraps like a seagull
Waitin on the people at the next table to leave a tip
So I can put it in my pocket
Phoney Easter Bunny,Santa Claus and the stork
We was poor as fuck so we ate a lot of pork
And it ain't no motherfuckin way no how
When it come up I let you bring me down
So I stick to the boots and I'm down with a MAAD group
Of gangstas and hoodlums,but you can call em 'scroops'
Give me liberty or give me death
Cos a man without pride ain't got shit left,huh
And now that I'm older with kids of my own
I put me in the pot where it used to be a bone
Get'cha self together,word is born
Cos a man can't live on a can-o-corn[Ice Cube]
Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test
With four brothers in the SS
I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin' in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin', I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me?
Or do they got love?
So when the light turns green, I don't bone out
I wanna see what these black men are all about
Cuz if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride...
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin out the one smokin' indo
Comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, cuz I'm color blind

[Threat]
Killa Cali, the state where they kill
Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong word
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
Cuz I slang these thangs like a G
It's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind

[KAM]
I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color, or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side
And you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now, I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
Cuz brothas, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down
I'm colorblind

[WC]
Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, Young and dumb and full of cum, I’m a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

[Coolio]
Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin'
Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'
Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side

[WC]
Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip

[Coolio]
So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross

[WC]
Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side

[Coolio]
I ain't contributin to genocide (why?)
Cause I'm colorblind

[King Tee]
Niggas in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned.
Baby Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together and we color 'em dead
Dead, dyin, gettin smoked's like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

[J-Dee (Lench Mob)]
I understand how all my homeboys feel
Cuz I been shot; to this day, I pack my steel
Cuz I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep
Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind[Verse One: Coolio]

Seven in the morning, standing in the line
Three fools in front of me, drinking on some wine
Two in the back of me sucking on a joint
And one in back of them begging for a newport
There's 4-5 suckers way way in the back
Stooped down low with the crowd smokin' crack
They looking at me funny coz I got a record out
And a nigga with a record out is supposed to have some clout
A fourth of the people in the line need some help
But the other fourth betta had help themself
A fourth of the people having good faith
And all of the rest all fucked up in the head
A bald headed stank bitch is about to make me laugh
And a nigga who need a bath is asking for my autograph
Ain't nothing changed but the time
I got to get mine, so I'm standing in the county line

[Hook: Coolio]

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Coz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
You got to have a car in this land of milk and honey

[Verse Two: Coolio]
I walked through the front door to fill out my ap
Here comes another sap asking if I rap
I don't say a word coz he know that I do
I'm down with the MAAD ass U know Hoo!
I take a numer and a seat
I'm sweating from the heat
Somebody got their shoes off
I smell their feet
My number is 80, it's still on 20
I look up at the clock and now IS 10:30
Free butter and cheese oh please, oh please
Can I get my food stamps so I can leave
I got money and a car but they don't really know it
Now they asking me a gang of questions coz I told them I was homeless
I'm living in a car drive back in the alley
But I use to shack up with a hooker named Sally
Line after line
Ruff is the time
My life is in a bomb so I'm standing in the county line

Chorus

[Verse Three: Coolio]
I'm sittin' at a desk talking to a social worker
She thinks I'm a fool but I know that I can work her

-Punk ass ho' sittin' behind the window all toe up ass tramp
Runnin that weak shit talkin bout

"You have a penetentry record"
-I said I know that BIATCH!

She wants to know what kind a work do I do
I said I haven't worked since 1982
I can't find a job though I looked and I looked
Took one hit of the crack and mistook
She sittin there wonderin' what did coz I did
And the whole time I'mma watchin like I'm smokin me a joint
Job search work the projects whackness
And in a few weeks I'd get my check
Now I got to wait for them to call me trough the window
So I can get some cash to pay for the hotel and the bathshow
It's 5:13 by the clock on the wall
Mothafuckez move so I can make a phonecall
Shit is getting late and the time is 29
That why so many niggas standing in the county line

Chorus 2X to fadeI love it when we're cruisin' together
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby get in we fixin' to cruise till we can't
You got the drink I got the denk and we done stopped at the bank
Sunbeamin' this weekend heading down that beach way
Messin' with my girl's hair one of them games that we play
Braids bouncin to the beat feel me coming down the street
She gotta be a freak if she's sittin' next to me so
Shine up your hoopty and fall in line
Bring your honey if she's fine and we gon have a good time
To the outskirts of first buzzin off the erky jerks
Swoopin while I puts in work now watch me skirt
I heard 'em callin' me but they not ballin' see
Cause if you're ballin' me you got your own set of keys
The breeze is hittin' don't think you'll catch me strippin'
40 Thevz Wino and gat got that back when we're dippin
To the west coast down south in your direction
Throwin up the hood cruisin' come on we jettin'

Cruisin' is made for love

MALIKA:
Put one in my lap get in an' twist the cap
Hand him the jizz back clownin' up the coast like that
Tanqueray all nice in back seat peep
This duo rollin' top down ready to hit the streets
Shoulder to shoulder turnin' heads cause it's a black thing
Sport in a 'vette brings me strapped won't be no jackin'
Consider that chocolate, mixed with that tie
Wind be on my neck the beach caress my thighs now I hope he's high
Ready to get my groove on so I'm playing tease
Know when he's feelin' me, and what those feelin's be
Kinda' flossy cause tossy we do it on seat tip
Snuggled up freaky dick give the drink a sip
Leaning on his chest I feel security
Just my man and me against the world you understandin' me
Cruisin' to the sunsets yep we'll be headin out
Dippin' through the city me and my niggys what I'm talkin about

I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us

Sunday afternoons in the tape deck
My woman's on the right lookin bomb for this trek deck
Floatin' on the freeway at a cool 65
Malika rolls the top so's I can feel that rocky mountain high yeah
Take the wheel while I shake off this headrush
Yep I'm down the bust like no one like what
Watchin' the sunset be the flyest with the top down
Park up at the spot I ain't gonna front I'm tryin to mess around
MALIKA:
Your homies still around
Coolio:
Yeah they busy though
MALIKA:
That's all I need to know roll up the windows and lock the door
It's all that poppin on that cooze got me worked up
Turn up the beat and bump in-between the seats some
Coolio:
Yeah that's how we do it on the western hemisphere
All my homies be a man cause ain't no pretendin'
Cruisin feel the wind blow my brains back
Trippin off into the night bumpin' to a fat track yeah

I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us

I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us[Verse One: Coolio]
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinkin
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin and smokin
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

[Hook]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Verse Two: Lek Ratt - 40 Thevz]
More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta lay the struggle
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag colour, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'mma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there with muted sounds bumpin

[Hook]

[Verse Three: PS - 40 Thevz]
You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

[Hook]

[Outro: Coolio]
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

[Hook] - to fade["So much drama in the..."]

[Verse One: Ras Kass]

No disrespect to the opposite sex
But I ain't flexed punani yet that's worth my royalty checks
Men be trying to get laid, women be trying to get paid
So, somebody gotta get played... {right}
Now you claim I'm runnin game and still let us run the train
Pulling Coolio's braids, it wasn't me, it was the fame
Let a dame complain about disrespecting my African queen
Ass hangin out them Daisy Dukes jeans, jockin
Damn I love civilization
Wants to know my occupation home location and means of transportation
The correct combination unlocked your placenta
I got a cellular phone with a rubber antenna
On a three story house, drive a four door Ac
Favorite song of all time Mobb Deep's "Hit It From the Back"
Then jet, I turn a bitch into my favorite
She know my name cause I got more game than Sega CD

Chorus: Coolio, Ras Kass

You know it's drama, but it sound real good (3X)
You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back
You know it's drama, but it sound real good (3X)
You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back

Verse Two: Ras Kass

I try U.N.I.T.Y. but why?
Cause when I was lackin, bitches made me want to roll over and die
So now I lie, cause bitches are like flies {why?}
They attract to the best shit {oh!}
You gotta play Max Julian's role unless you plan on being celibate
Cause bitches want the money clip and whatever dick that comes with it
{The bitch} saw me in the Lex and didn't know it came from Avis
Now she's on the Tip like my name was John Davis
And I'm knowin what she thinks {what?}
I'mma sweep her off her feet because I bought the ho a drink
Bitch, haha yeah I'm living nice, got a two o'clock flight to Atlanta
{Tomorrow} so maybe we can kick it {tonight}
Right there I knew my dick was getting wetted
Cause I played into this bitch's Cinderella complex
Whatever you want to hear, I can say
Forget the bitch the next day, instant replay

Chorus

Verse Three: Coolio

Yo Ras, let me talk about these bitches for a minute
But let's get it straight, when I say the word bitch
I don't mean all women
Cause hookers come a dime a dozen if you thought they wasn't
You can hit this ho today, and tomorrow you can hit her cousin
Or her mama, you gots to have drama
Nigga flash some currency and go up in her auntie!
I'm talkin bout the skanless type loc
You know the type that seem to like the taste of swipe
Check it
When it comes to Saving Hoes Coolio ain't in it
Don't call me Captain, general, sergeant, or lieutenant
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
I gave the bitch my autograph, and she gave me some ass
But as soon as the ho tried to get in my pocket
I shot her ass away from me *schch* like a skyrocket
Take it from a G, period, no comma, to keep these hookers
On they toes... you know the rest

ChorusVerse One: E-40

When I was fifteen years old
Straight dope game I was told
I went from, selling pennies of the riders dank-ah (riders dank-ah)
Timin ass think of slangin crank (think of slangin griqua)
Situation critical: phone home, phone home
Talkin on my digital: call phone
Ya seen a boatload of situations, for dangleations
Invalid ghetto pass late ass registrations
Boy I tell you shit is pitiful, damn!
Vocally repentable, dead right!
I try to stay away from artificial (artificial)
Plastic ass (plastic ass), pleather motherfuckin individuals
(Fuckah!!)

Verse Two: Coolio

One lone loco rides away
Into the sunset but, I ain't done yet
Respect yourself and wear your vest
Keep your guard up cause fools be hard up
When you hittin dips better check yo' clips and
Watch the police and the Bloods and the Crips
Anyway you choose got ta pay your dues
Keep one in the chamber cause the shoes always loose
Rubber wheels beat rubber heels anyday
Put the green in your jeans and get the holes out ya halo
Or you can stay broke while your homies is rollin smokes
And sippin yak and smokin dank and tellin jokes, haha
Pa-pap, pa-pap *gunshot sound accompanies*, fool you can have that

And put yourself in heaven on Earth, before you pass
And exercise yo' game -- exercise yo' game fool

Verse Four: 40 Thevz

Peep game from a young ass, rollin on the one way
Foot to the gas got the indo mixed with hash
Monday through Sunday and all in-between
I fiend for my paper, my fed, and my green
Ain't no busters or no suckers on my team or in my mattress
Just call me the Pimp
And you can call me the Rat
Watch my feet hit the tracks it, ain't no lookin back
I'm on a mission tryin to put my fuckin click on the map
But these niggas don't know the half
Runnin with riff raff but I got some game for your bitch ass
Cause your game is weaker than an anorexic
I exercised my game until I had my game perfected
I wrote the game on paper then I put the game on record
You better check it nigga don't you every disrespect it

E-X-C-E, R-I-S-E, Y-O-G-A, M-E for-dy/40

[Cool] Yeah, Barr 9 in the houseCome on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab your gat with the extra clip and
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
Kick it, kick it, yeah, that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin', ain't no crippin'
Ain't no punk-ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody's got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black, I
Wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya
If you can't take the heat get your ass out the kitchen
We on a mission
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
With switches on the block in a '65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
No valley low enough for mountain high

I'm trying to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice, a
Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive-by killers
I still got to worry about those snitch-ass niggas
I keep on searching and I keep on looking
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be acting like they evil
You don't understand about running with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang, and
You don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
That's why I pack my .45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of the apple pie
Every game ain't the same, cause the game still remains
Don't it seem kinda strange, ain't a damn thing change
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down-ass niggas can ride with me
Hop-hop-hop your five quickly down the block
Stay sucka-free and keep the busters off your jock
You gotta have heart son, if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody cryin' ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worried, everybody's tryin'
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have something, you better start frontin'
What ya gonna do when the 5 roll by
You better be ready, so you can ride

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
When you're living in a city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
You better be ready when the 5 roll by
Just roll along- that's what you do
Just roll along- that's right
Just roll along- that's what you do
Just roll along- that's right
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me,do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me,do you want to ride with meNow I didn't use the word bitch a few times in a rhyme, but
Now it's '95 so let me drop a line
This goes out to the young black queens
On the neighborhood scene
Who haven't lost their dream
I know sometimes it seems like it ain't no love
And to get where you go ya got to push an' shove
Around the way girl with hope in your heart
Do his five in the purse an' five in the start
She's the kinda woman ya take home to momma
The only kind you ever let get past the drama
Coolio know that you ain't no ho
And it's time to put you up on a pedestal seat
Queen of the entire universe
And you know how I know that you were put here first
An' to every nigga that dissed ya an' every nigga that hit ya
Accept my apologies for my brothaz....

(Chorus)
My...sista...
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
You're all I need...

Princess of the Nile
An' sweet black sexy child
Ooh I like your style, huh
First motha on the planet
I know it's gettin' scary
And all these wannabe pimps is all that ya meet
But ya gotta shake 'em off like fleas an' nigga meat
And use your God-given talents and abilities
No matta where ya from ya get much respect
From the top of your neck to your county check
I see ya waitin' for the bus in the early morn
Brick house with a face like Leena Horne
I ain't no cap to save a ho
But I got your front
An' your side an' your back if that's what ya want
So when it's time to put it down I won't be runnin'
Ya got a dear lil' somethin' like Harriet Tubmanm, huh
No matta what ya do or where ya go
Ya got love from a nigga named Coolio....

-Chorus-

Hernie Dipp got the lips, finga tips, and the hips
Ta make mice outa the crazy-ass Bloodz and Crypts
Make a nigga sing a song all night long
Til' his voice is gone
Wit' no music on
You can be a busta on a hardass low
An' should be down wit' your ass when your poor and broke
And um uh
Every time ya need I'll owe ya
Gotta do is make a phone call, cuz
When ya say 'come' ya know she's on her way
Wit' no hesitance
An' any type of delay
I talk about my granny
Batana, an' Vanita
Jacki an' Nicole an' Grandy an' Artisha
I gots to give credit where credit is due
An' all credit that is credited is credit to you
I give praise to your wayz
An' for all my day
Apologies much respect to the sons I raise....

-Chorus(extended)-[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda g that little homie's wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the street light

[Hook 1: LV]
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set tripping banger
And my homies are down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothing but a heart beat away
I'm living life do or die, what can I say
I'm twenty-three now, will I ever live to see twenty-four
The way things is going I don't know

[Hook 2: LV]
Tell me why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!

[Verse 2]
Look at the situation, they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set-trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die-a, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-fo'?
The way things is goin' I don't know

[Bridge: L.V.]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I got to learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't

{*choir sings until the end*}What you gonna play now
Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up

Every geto got a different name, but they all the same
So Coolio loco gonna put you up on game
We got homies who sell straps
Homies who sell crack
Homies who sell the bomb chronic sacks and fat dubs
Giving the neighborhood niggas love
Pimps, players, suckers, hoes, forty thieves, gangstas, and thugs
Two hoodrats be scrapping over who knows what
The loudmouth one loced up in front of the icecream truck
And broke all of her lee nails where the big G's live
The little homie be gettin' out on account
This time he might get stuck attempted
One eight seven and he's a minor with priors
So the DA want him tried as an adult
The big homey just had a son no joking
I think his baby's mom is smoking cause she always broke
And the young girls is dressing more and more sleazy
And everybody and their momma talking bout OJ defense

To the hoochies in the Hondas and Sentras
Young niggas fightin' their case with public defenders
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
To the niggas who smokin' indo chocolate tired of stress
Niggas who got warrants out for their arrest
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

Slap boxin' with all the young hoochies watchin'
Dead cats in the street playing craps
Niggas catchin dice with they feet
Think they got the funk that one fool got stoked out
Cos he's a mark with a gun
The nosy bitch up the street called 9-1-1 now
One time his d jacked a nigga and old bitch
Licence and registration
"All I got is a drivers permit"
Niggas can't have shit we got dogs that rip but don't even trip
Welcome to Southern California
Liquor stores and churches on every other corner
Your little brother plays pop warner
Darks raided the dope spot
Eight year old kid got shot cos they mistook his BB gun for a Glock
And I ain't forgot about the homey Lano
He got killed by a sucker way back in the eighties oh
I heard the homies mighties is ballin' out of state
He got himself off unemployment checks in Section 8

Hey the homiez kickin' it real
Yeh I hear what he's sayin' loc
Sometimes it's just like that in the hood
Yeh don't nothin' change of the game but the name
That's right you know that's right

To the young hustlers that's trying to stack that knot up
The house parties that's gonna always get shot up
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
Community programs to stop the violence
All the niggers who loced up during the L.A. riots
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

The nigga with all 16 switches sitting ODs
Who got jacked he tried to pull out his gat
Pulling sex in through his back
Now his momma ain't all black
And niggas is going to the barber to get a fade
They carried their dead homey to his grave
Pour out a little liquor
Homegirl down the street with the green eyes and big titties is getting
Thicker
Neighborhood clubs beat him up and crackheads be selling tvs and vcrs
For forty bucks so what's up
Yesterday the homey committed a bank caper
Saw the chase on the news and read the story in today's paper
His little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike
While her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike
The little homey just tripped and stripped
Because he didn't realize that the joint was dipped
That's right
OG's joining the nation and it's all good
Big G's is retaliating cause they enemies are crossed out the hood

Crackhead momma's smoking whole accounting checks
Dopedealers who serve liquor pieces for sex
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
Young niggas going to school to be a doctor
Late night sounds of gunshots and helicopters
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

To all the motherfuckers who think their shit don't stank
Rollin D.B.s and then appear for robbing banks
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites
This is just a little something for a nigga
That's still gonna be a nigga if he don't get no bigger
Be your own good ride
Right right
These are the geto hilites

Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up

Get on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up

To fade...Verse One: Malika

Steppin up out the shadows I comes equipped to wreck
Hold up just a sec Coolio I'm on deck (Malika)
Yeap the diction is on point
Causin, friction when I flex up the jaw to hit the joint
That can actually give a blood mob like Gotti
Like the body cool, keep the strap up by the naughties
Niggie trippin why you beam us I don't step up with no bullshit
See that there it's clip for this stickup on the hip
Peep the correct way to get your pimp on
Let me hit the bong oh and my mind's quite strong
Wreck it nice and proper if it's on I'm finsta to stop her
If I'm swingin for the knockout, best believe I'm fits to drop her
Ninety-five's on poppin, representin I keep stompin
Throw up my fists just like this when I'm mobbin

Verse Two: Shorty

I killed the last, killed the ass, with my ninety-five drive
I'm deep like Denzel with my Crimson Tide, nigga
Like Chaka Khan, I tell you something good
I'm Hi-C like Spike Lee within Tales From the Hood
You need it, I'll feed it, baby check the size
Have you Goin' Down like Mary J. Blige
When it's poppin like this, you can't be a coward
Shorty freaks fuckin beats like Adina Howard
My squad is hard, with players, and hustlers
No toleration, for fakers and busters
Fuckin with me with all honesty
You get bombed rap songs comin constantly
Bumpin G-15's, Westside scene
Killin the competition, while making a fuckin green
So ring, around the rosie, and mosey to the Rosie
And I want you to know G

Chorus:

We bust and cuss and kick up dust
Don't none of y'all niggas want to fuck with us
So what's the time?  It's time to get real
Why you bust your rhyme?  Cause I got skills

We bust and cuss and kick up dust
Don't none of y'all niggas want to fuck with us
So what's the time?  It's time to get real
Why you bust your rhyme?  Cause that's how I bail

Verse Three: Leek Ratt (of 40 Thevz)

Watch me, swallow this nickel and shit five pennies
I'm the loc'est of them all though the rat is kinda skinny
How many linny and squidgy think they can see me?
I'm from Compton where even in the summer niggas wear beanies
Bustin lyrics sharper than razor blades catch it from head to toe
If you're shocked, then amazed, when you see me at my stage show
For my stage show beat em up
40 Thevz gettin busy rockin coast to coast
Dogs the most rap the hoes then rocks em up
Givin it up for hip-hop vicitims how should I drop em and then pop em
For poppin like to get what I got, and I ain't got a whole lot of nuthin
Cuz I been ruffin and scuffin so give it up when I'm bustin or get to duckin
Cuz I ain't given em nuthin
Fools can't get none, so fuck em!

Verse Four: PS

Let me rock the motherfuckin mic
Smoke a whole stick of dynamite, then fight all night
I got jabs like a welterweight champion
The pocket-pincher purse-snatcher pistol-packin
Quick to get it crackin
Went from jackin to rappin to runnin with a pack of mad men
Pull a trick out my sleeve like Aladdin
Some fool tried to play me for a punk I had to have him like
Lunch or dinner, he's just a beginner
Fuckin with a winner, number one contender top dog
Head nigga in charge runnin with a group of hogs
40 Thevz, MAAD Circle, Cat, and Crowbar
Best to put your daughter
Wack ass rappers get tossed up
Trying to come in here with that garbage
My crew see the dopest and the hardest
So clear the path or get your punk ass Bogart-ed

Chorus 1/2

Verse Five: Ras Kass

I peep game and get recognized, buyin all the hard liquor
Toothpick and beedy-dyin
Bitch you got dealt, peeled your cap the other way
Like a reversible Louis-Vitton Gucci belt
And ain't nothin crackin
For them niggas steppin up with the funk I'm packin Tinactin
Cause I be earnin stripes in tight bunches
All the homies carry nines I carry rhymes in sucker punches
What?  Tootsie, my knees don't bend
Just like that actor Hoffman I be Dustin off men often
Jaywalkin over your coffin with an eleven shot loss and
John wrecked that Austin won't soften you're lost and
See arson, to exterminate the flyest nigga like Orkin
Stalkin lofts men to New York and in between
So take caution, leave the flossin for dental hygeine
Mental plus my gene equals nasty young bastard
The raps be lung mastered takin vinyl's virginity
Coincidentally I run shit like Walter Payton
Niggas player hatin cause I spoke like a Dayton
I kick the bass like Ron Carter at the Carter when
CMB came strollin
Blowin niggas up like when Mookie's stupid ass got caught smokin
Figure, your stigma is lack of enigma
So bitch-ass niggas better step, like the Delta Sigma Thetas

Verse Six: Coolio

We don't give a fuck, fools better duck
39 deep in the back of Wino's truck
Like robbin in the paint, fool think I ain't?
Your crew is on stank, that's why I'm pullin rank
I rev like a motor float ON like a boat to
Kick a style like Tical from here to North Dakota
The ambassador of funk with amps in the trunk
And when it's time to rock a mic I won't be no punk
I bring death to the evil and power to the people
My name ain't Steve Miller but I Fly Like an Eagle
Don't play me for a chump, I get around like Gump
And I, got more con in my verse than Chuck
And you don't want no motherfuckin problems here
Cuz I can round up a posse like Paul Revere
Your whole crew'll get took out, turned out, shook out
Burned up like a cookout, so fools better look out

Verse Seven: WC

Fresh out the penalty box
Sportin a stockin cap, cut off dickies, and some high-top striped socks
The freestyle finatic pyschosomatic back at it causin static
With lyrics still as tight as a straight jacket
The last in line but one of the first to get wit cha
Bringin more terror to MC's than a Michigan militia
Click click boom, nigga fuck your crew
It's the chanky hip-hopper, takin over pissin in your stage monitor
Socket you think that you can fuck with mine in your wildest dreams
You best to wake up and apoligize
Niggas penetentiary yearn me cuz I, burn like Parker
But anyway, half of y'all couldn't see me with a pair of Blu Blockers
The lyrical night stalker stalkin at night in a pair of creased Khakis
Chuck Taylors, my pistol grip tight
Dub-C, that nigga from Westside MAAD Circle

Ay man!  Ay ay
What's up Wino?
Uh like loc, it's like late, let's get the fuck up out of here
Are we out?
Yeah yeah fuck it
Fuck it, MAAD Circle bitch!Once upon a time in a land called fuck
Lived a duck named Donald and his mother was a cluck
Mickey Mouse wore a rag, pants in a sag
Neighborhood kingpin, but his brother was a fag
Donald had beef, so Mickey couldn't sleep
They was fuedin for a while, and it was gettin kinda deep
Bugs Bunny had the props on the Eastside spots
Known to hit a five from a mile with a Glock
Goofy was Mickey Mouse righthand man
One day smoked a stick, and came up with a plan
Called Pixie and Dixie, two killers from Chicago
A game of 5K, to eliminate Donald
But what they didn't know, is Donald was a G
Had big time respect, from the West to the East
Have ya ass a seat, and listen to the funk
First chapter in the funky cartoon from the ghetto

Huey and Duey and Louie with a uzi
Shot down Mickey Mouse main ho Minnie
Everybody know Minnie got shot down
And the cop on the case was Huckleberry Hound
Huckleberry had a Deputy, by the name of Dog
Eye-witness to the crime was Kermit the Frog
But Kermit was scared and he wouldn't testify
Pixie and Dixie just did a driveby
On Donald Duck, but they shot and they missed
And now Bugs Bunny is gettin kind of pissed
Cause the shot that they missed hit his homeboy Elmer-
Fudd sellin bud on the motherfuckin corner
The future's lookin shitty in fuck city
So they called in the Feds, Beetlejuice and Miss Piggy
Niggas from the street, know that's how it goes
Scene two in the funky cartoon from the ghetto

Now the war is on and Mickey Mouse is dead
Quick Draw McGraw took two to the head
Huey and Duey and Louie got caught
And now they in the county, ready to sell out
Pixie and Dixie's on the run from the mob
Cause they tried to kill Donald and they didn't do the job
Bugs Bunny got popped, in a bar gettin drunk
Pulled a Glock on Beetlejuice, but Miss Piggy had a pump
Donald got the word that his nephews was snitchin
So Tom and Jerry stuck em on they way to the kitchen
Goofy was a punk and everybody knew
Him and Huckleberry Hound was spotted drinkin brew
In the alley out back, in the corner in the dark
But they both got smoked by Jabberjaw the Shark
Donald Duck got the whole damn city sewed up
In a ghetto cartoon in a land called fuck[Coolio]
Greeting, earthlings
We have now taken over your radio

[B-Real]
Going straight to the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breaking ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew taking all control
You can't get none of this, we're running this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this
Get out the lane, I'm coming through
And if you don't wanna move then I'm coming right through you

[Coolio]
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now your whole crew is dust
Coming through my area, I'mma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?

Chorus:
[B-Real]
We want it all (want it all!)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor!)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore!)
In the game we take you to war (war!)
You ain't seen nothing like this before
[All]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

[Method Man]
Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Megalomaniacal monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep coming down like rain
You feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger, you're dealing with offical hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk

[LL Cool J]
Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessing and moves is animated
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is getting money
When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies (Uhh!)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (Uhhh!)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money?
Or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay
Lounging in the mothership back around my way (Uhh!)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I getting lyrical?
Daddy, I think so
Monstar dropping flavor fluid so drink slow

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, God bless!!
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed balling, on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off!!
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock!!
I'm starting a line-up by getting y'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be?
They be the Monstars!

[Hook]Intro: A homeboy is somebody that got your back
Whether you right or wrong
Somebody that excepts you for what you are
Not what you got on, what you can do for them
If you lucky enough to have some then
You know what I'm talkin bout

Verse 1:
Friends, how many of us have them
And not that many
The chances of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny
But, it seems there really ain't a damn thing you can do
Cause since the seventies, it seems everybody been rolling with a crew
A team, a gang, a posse, or some type-a click
And if your firm ain't thick
Then your squad becomes vixed
Be extra careful or the ones you call your partna
Cause what they really is, is a busta out to rob ya
And, be weary of strangers bearing your God and gifts
And a wolf in sheeps clothing
Cause some of y'all ain't knowing
Me and you go back like roaches in the projects
And, we done been through things they still ain't even thought of yet
A good homie is hard to come by
But most times you get done by the ones you trust most
So, I gotta raise a toast
To my tried and tested, and straight up for real dose
Pour yourself some exol, this ones here for you, loc

Chorus, Coolio, (Montell Jordan):
I don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Uh, but, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)
Thick and thin, nigga
You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter, then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)

Verse 2:
Now I done met a lot of haters in my lifetime
That I would of smoked if i would of had a Tek 9
But, here I stand as a man, and I'm free to say
I'm hella glad that my momma didn't raise me that way
And the homies I grew up with
Locs I threw up with
Is the kind of fools that you don't want to buck with
Why does it seem that the good brothers die
And the evil brothers live
And prosper and multiply
Pass the Hennessey to the left hand side
Want some many dirt for the homies that expired
I hope you rest in peace
And, when it's time for my release
I'll meet you at the crossroads dippin in the low-low
But, until then I'ma keep my rolls slow
My flow on tight, and stay rollin with the 4-0
This is comin from the one and only
And like MC Shan said, "I'll never leave you lonely"

Chorus, Coolio, (Montell Jordan):
I don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)
Thick and thin, nigga
You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)

Verse 3:
Me and you is like family
And everybody know that we go back to back
And we go toe to toe
Comin from the west
Where the sets run thick
Where brothers either bang or try to make a grip
I cross my heart and hope to die
I never lie
I run out on mine
Anywhere or anytime
Me and my homies don't get involved with that he say, she say
But, if you've lost you'll recieve a ass whippin with your instant replay
Or, deckin like Tekken
So, show some respect when respect is given to you
And, watch out for the forty too
Fake curve
And fools who got the nerve
To pretend that they was down
When last month they wadn't even around
West coast, East coast, and worldwide
My homies in the pen, and my homies that lived and died
I'm still the same little nappy head brother from the eastside
And, you can call me homeboy

Chorus, Coolio, (Montell Jordan):
I don't fly on air or walk on water (Or walk on water, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)
Thick and thin, nigga
You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter then you got a dime (If I got a quarter then you got a
Dime)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours (Watch my back, then I'll watch
Yours, yours)
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)
I don't fly on air, walk on water (Iiii, don't walk on water, no)
You can count on me till the end (Count on me till the end, oh-yeah)
Thick and thin (Thick and thin)
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter then you got a dime (If I got a quarter then you got a
Dime)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Call me up no matter what
The time)
If you (If you)
(Watch my back, I'll watch yours, yours)
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)
(You can call me homeboy, boy, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(I got your back, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(You can call me homeboy)
(You can call me homeboy)
