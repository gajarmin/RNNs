[Intro: Girl on answering machine]
Hi baby
I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much
I think about you I feel you in my arms
I miss you... I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much that I'd do anything
I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I just wanna fuck bad bitches
All them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
Mad at your boyfriend, ain't 'cha?
You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hitman hit it; damn bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin about
Chicken head, chicken fed, with a dick in yo mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(Airtouched) Next time you need a taste

[Hook: Devin the Dude]
I just wanna fuck you
No touching and rubbing girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissing and hugging girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, donâ€™t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin
That your pussy's been tampered with
Then you show him the new trick
Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick
You be workin it like a dancer, bitch; it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my morning digging through some records instead
But, tonight I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's looking for ya
He's always trying to run ya
Don't worry bout me handcuffing girl
Cause I just wanna

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Fuck witchu
On the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, you freak bitch?
You acting like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' half-dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowing up my pager, the shit's gettin major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Something to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (see-ya!)
24/7, Dre, Snoop and Devin
We serving these hoes and never loving these hoes

[Hook][Hook]
Rolling up another Swisha, listening to the beat again
Dranking but we concentrating, smoke another Sweet again
Steadily rewinding trying to make some hot shit
Oh what a job this is
Another all nighter trying to get it done
Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh what a job this is

[Verse 1: Devin the Dude]
Dranking yet I'm thinking of another rhyme
Smoking, hoping that some bad news will come some other time
Cause I'm trying to do what I love, I love what I do
This music is something mo' different than the weed and the brew
That's why we mashing we ain't asking for nothing we working for it
Push it, peddle it to the people they can't ignore it
This is for all the independents, a few major labels
The big studios who still give niggas favors
On the mixing and mastering
Puzzling and plastering the tracks together
On tapes, CDs, wax or whatever
This is for all the engineers who smoke weed
Can't forget about the production costs and all the hidden fees
For another rhyme written, we spend time spitting in the booth
Sometimes it's like a pigeon coop
But it's all for the cause, so I'm
Gonna continue to MC and smoke weed, you know I'm

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
As easy as it looks to you I make it look so easy
With the music I be making the impression I be leaving
A lot of folks they stop and stare, thinking Im'a trick it off
I roll another bleezy, puff it, pass it and shake it off
Move on to the next phase and it's amazing
The next generation of rappers, big Snoop Dogg raising
That's fifteen years in the game
Still got the fortune and fame, yeah I'm doing my thang
Check this Devin
Somebody said that real Gs to go heaven
So I'mma keep spitting the truth on these fools like a reverend
Stay open like 7-11 that's 24/7
When you need some hot shit stop by and get you a beverage
I'm serving, my rhymes like nickels and dimes
Plug it in, let it play and let me blow your mind
It's the dominant conglomerate prominent and I'mma get
What I gotta get, twist another sweet and bob to the beat

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
We work nights, we some vampires
Niggas gather round the beat like a campfire
Singing folk songs, but not no Kumbaya my Lord
You download it for free, we get charged back for it
I know you're saying, they won't know, they won't miss it
Besides, I ain't a thief, they won't pay me a visit
So if I come to your job, take your corn on the cob
And take a couple kernels off it that would be alright with you
Hell no, yeah exactamundo
But we just keep recording and it ain't to get no condo
And Candy Bentley fanny with no panties in Miami
And that cute lil' chick named Tammy that you took to the Grammys
See we do it for that boi that graduated
That looked you in your eyes real tough and said 'preciate it
And that he wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for your CD number nine
And he's standing with his baby momma Kiki and she crying talkinbout
That they used to get high to me in high school
And they used to make love to me in college
Then they told me 'bout they first date, listening to my tunes
And how he, like to finger nail polish
I say hate to cut you off but I gotta go
I wish you could tell me mo' but I'm off to the studio, gotta write tonight
Hey, can you put us in your raps
I don't see why not
Devin it's the Dude you gon' probably hear him talking bout

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, this life we live. What a job this is. Real spit man
A lot of folks want to walk in these shoes but they just don't know man
It's a hell of a job, man
To be a rapper, MC, whatever you want to call it, man
We got a lot to deal with. Family members we gotta always look out for
Baby momma nagging, you knowImsaying kids need this
And then again the public need that, we gotta make hot music
Cause if it ain't hot it don't mean shit
But you know, it's all in a day's work

What a job this is my nigga
What's crack-a-lacking Devin the Dizzude
Snoop D-O dub, J Prince, Jazz Prince
Yeah, Rap-A-Lot still on top. 2007{Scarface}

Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

Chorus:

You must be used to all the finer thangs
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

{Too $hort}

I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But everytime I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

Repeat Chorus:

{Devin}

Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know thats my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuch her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my sidee
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and onlly
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

Repeat Chorus:

{Tela}

I got a call from Laquesha and some of her neices
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fuckin for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my suprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn ho I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases

Devin:
You know what I'm saying baby
It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin Scarface in style

Repeat Chorus[Hook]
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way?

You probably don't have a big ol house on the hill
But if you did just imagine how would it feel
If your phone got disconnected, no cash, and ya gas cut off
And the gal that you had that was helping just stepped the fuck off
She took the kid, the dog, and the kitty
And everybody know you're at a low they feel pity
And what's really fucked up is now you're just normal
No more hoes, no more clothes, can't go to the show cuz it's formal
And you wonder why why why why why
And you resort to gettin high
But damn, you can't find ya stash
And you never took the time to ask yourself

[Hook] w/ scratches: "Don't front, don't front"

You probably don't have a lot of money
But if you did would you find it funny
If you lent, and you spent it, and you didn't invest
Or put it in the bank so it can gain some interest
You just went and got the biggest car you could find
And a couple more just like it so your friends can follow behind
Never mind how much it costs, you copped the best weed to smoke
And for her a fur coat
You got jet skis and boats
And next thing you're broke (damn)
And the yacht that you got, it won't sail or float
You look back and try to catch someone's attention for help
You made a right at the light and they made a left and you ask yourself

[Hook]

Why they do me that way
Yeah
Hey hey hey
Ain't no more doobies in the tray
What you gonna do when the people go home (home home home)
{*scratches: "Don't front"*}
Wanna smoke some weed but the reefer's all gone (gone gone gone)
{*scratches: "Don't front"*}
What you gonna do when your friends go home {*"Don't front"*}
And you wanna drink a beer but your end's all gone (gone gone gone)
{*scratches: "Don't front"*}
All gone {*"Don't front"*}

Uh-oh. Hehe. Shit I think I found...
I found a...
Hey! I found a bag of weed. And it...{*breathes in*}
Smells pretty motherfuckin' good {*exhales*}
I'mma call up some more partnas man, finna smoke
Bring the cigars nigga {*"Don't front"*}
{*singing*} Ooooo Yeaaaahh Heeeey Heyy Hey Heeeeeyyya Yeyah
Told ya I can't sing man, I just be in here bullshittin'[Hook: Big KRIT]
So I ride, I lean, I crawl
Do it better than them all
Let the road be my guide
As I glide in candy cars
Underneath the moon and the stars

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Yeah, yo, my digital dash, as I mash on the gas
Don't know where I'm going fast, but I'm going there
Stop at the club, forever sure there's some hoes in there
Shaking they ass, looking for players with dough to share, but that ain't me though
Before I trick on a bust-it baby, I'm outta the do'
If you are looking for saving shawty, I'm not your hero
More like a guide
I can take you where you want, would you look in my eye?
Like you supposed to, cold enough to froze ya
Talking bout that pimping you already been exposed to
Far from being sober, let's travel into space while
Puffing on this Yoda, glowing like a lightsaber
Doing what the grownups do
Be grateful that this game was bestowed upon to you
Cause backstabbing betrayers divide, don't listen to
Cause they front, but they don't, do what I do
Cause they will never ever be pimps

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
Under the moon and stars I cruise in my car with you in my arms
I'm feeling good with my brews and cigars
As the sun dips down, we skip town
A nice rendezvous, I'm quite fond of you
And you're feeling me too, I mean literally
You're rubbing the nuts, you tickle the D
Let me drop the top while we puff on trees
Let the breeze blow through your weave
As you bob your head to the beat
Come on girl, take them heels off your feet
Vibe this sweet right quick
You take a hit and relax
I know you had a long day, I'mma turn up the music
And you can put the phone away and we can... just chill
Come over here and grip this wood wheel

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Now usually I don't 'posed to brag
But, 'till they different I was crush brewed but don't need pros and I was with it
Get it, get it, get it
Girl if I hit it I'm gonna stretch that pussy out until you can drive a truck up in it
I'm kiddin', maybe not, I'm on it like fo's in vogues
Playas with alligators and capes like matadors
Struttin' like kings up on the scene and scatter rose
Peddles up under a work of art like sour dough
Dial it, my swag melodic
Like a sandy beach, couple freaks in the cottage
Fig fruits and groups rubbed oil up on my body
Worked hard to swipe her card, the type of broad to take me shoppin'
Because my ego big enough to get up out it
Plug a socket, fix a drape and paint her walls redecorated
What a dime, excavated, dig deeper and deeper in all the right places

[Hook:][Hook: Gucci Mane]
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong
Kush is my cologne, Ku-Kush is my cologne

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Got a swisher filled up with that one hitter quitter, bro
Bubba for your troubles on the double itl'l get you bro
Pass me the D's, light it up with ease, in a cirle full of Gâ€™s, Smoking on them trees
Pass me a cigar, and i'm-a bust it down quick
Pass me the purple, make sure that ho is round and thick
Break it down, fill it up, roll it up and light it
And you know itâ€™s the bomb, soon as it get ignited
Pimping I canâ€™t even fight it, it's calling me to smoke
So I fire up another square and take another toke
I be damn near goin broke
And my girl say Iâ€™m wrong, shit but

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm inhaling it, exhaling it, it makes me more intelligent
I feel like Iâ€™m still mailing it or selling it, they smelling it
Kush, purp, strong dro. What I need cologne for?
They tried to send me to rehab but I said
"No, no I won't go"
Damn it's really loud, smelling like a whole pound
Kush cologne, haze is her perfume
Bubba kush for breakfast, with my Captain Crunch
I smoke ten blunts before lunch
Know that sounds like thatâ€™s too much
I'm so high, I'm so in the sky, everybody know
Marijuana is my fragrance, probably smell it on my clothes
I smoke that bubonic sonic, I've been sipping gin and tonic
You lil' boys is hooked on phonics, Gucci hooked on chronic sonny

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: E-40]
I'm in this booch hella keyed (hella keyed, man, I'm sacked)
Man I've been smoking hella weed (Hella tweed man, and I ain't talking about Twitter, man, I'm talking about tweed)
Lick it twist back down
Probably won't know how I go home
Babe be wanna suck my bone
She gotta fuck me jeans on
Fuck me dress on, fuck me jeans on, fuck me dress off, fuck me jeans on
Anything holling a dane
Tryin' get brain butIdon't know her name
Looking at my chain
Let me explain
Kush, cocaine but I don't make it rain
Gimme the gudda bitch, no extension
Pay me up or pay me no attention
Send a botch, like you send it
Make her upload, All up in it
Retirement plan, Booch you my pension
Hater repellant, my brand new invention
Everything that I say I meant it
Rasied in the Bay where itsâ€™ so pimpinâ€™
Raised in the Bay where itâ€™s so pimpinâ€™
Raised in the Bay where the bitches tempting

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 4: Devin the Dude]
Kush is my cologne, I got many fragrances
Shit gets so expensive but I hardly have to pay for shit
Every puff is like a squirt, smell it all off in my shirt
Coworkers give me compliments every time I go to work
What kinda cologne you on?
Dro is like my aftershave
Have me feelin and smellin so good yo I donâ€™t have to bathe
But by all means, I must keep my balls clean
Make sure my dicks legit then I go take care the small things
And it all seems worth it
450's kinda steep but I deserve it
Weed smell so loud that you think you heard that purp[Bridge:]
Glisten like the sun off the candy
Got the tool in the dash, keep it handy
Jammin', up and down the boulevard, swang
Trunk still bangin', screens still hangin'
Old habits die hard, ain't shit changed
Bumping, still reclined, still swang and bang
Grippin' wood grain, grippin' wood grain

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
I remember when I used to roll
A bucket, no ducat to my name and my soul
Hoes used to front everywhere I go
But that's cool
Yea shit changed cause we on
Now I'm tailor made, choppin' blades and I'm grown
Now the same hoes won't leave me alone
But that's cool

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
So now usually I don't boast or brag
But, today different
Went from bucket, brake scrappin', to swinging like Kenny Griffey
I was scrawny than a motherfucker
When I was younger, got my weight up like a jumper
Now I'm solid wit' these numbers
Maxin' out on these hoes,Marinated my pimpin'
Cause when you season they peepin'
And scrape it right out the skillet
Got a vision for vixens, drop it low like the bass
Her pussy tighter than pliers that squeeze the wine outta grapes
So I hit it slow
Flea flicker, give and go
I know that the shine the only reason she kick it for
I went from not a thing, to a Caddy frame, throw it off in the game
When you came and you got changed, shit can't be the same
So I'm chillin', bumpin', grillin'
Hollin' out fuck the feeling's of critics
That claim they come from slums but they from the village for real
Cause while these lames sittin' still
I hit the road, broke the mold, and came up on a mil
BITCH!

[Hook: Devin The Dude]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Man I'm a wild motherfucker, back when I was round 20
Fuck niggas nah you wouldn't find me round any
Rollin' one deep in the Buick parked ave
With a sawed off shotgun that cut your ass in half
Laughin' at these niggas that was hatin' on the low
Cause on the cool, I was puttin' dick off in they ho
And on the cut, you couldn't short stop me for the blow
Cause I be with the pistol, knockin' on your front door
See where I come from, you can't just tell me that you hard
Niggas'll come and box you up in your front yard
Betta' to not talk about pullin' out the GAT
Cause on sight we put that 9 milli to yah' hat
Now as I got older, my rep got colder
These niggas wouldn't dare to knock the chip up off my shoulder
Certified soldier with the stripes that'll prove it
I got my reputation in the streets, fuck the music

[Hook: Devin The Dude]

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
Yea! Reporting live from the ceiling, enjoy the view bitch
Sho' gone make a killin', ain't nothin' new bitch
Cept' the pressure from the heckle checkin' from the nosebleeds
Ho please, I can't even see you from my flo' seats
The boy came to play and no this ain't a game
Dunkin', trunkin, thumpin' purple colored gators mayne
Hold up, this win is on us
It's a celebration, bitch, every time I show up
Get in the way, get swole up
That's no luck for anyone tryna outshine us
Plenty of haters that couldn't get haters are heard steppin' behind us
Better catch on to our coattails, I boast well, while I shit talk
That bullshit we don't let walk
Cripple their chances, cripple advances, stickin' the landin'
Then I, jumped up off the porch wit'
All of this dough that I'm gone get
Respect that or get yo' dome split
And on it I stay, no reprieve for no punk
Consider your ship sunk, I'm just bein' Big Sant bitch

[Bridge:][Intro: Devin the Dude]
That's alot of weed, thats a whole lotta weed man
We gonna smoke all that? We gonna smoke all that?
Come on man, let's smoke man, let's smoke man

[Verse 1 : Berner]
Wrap the snake around a king size J
Wax drippin' on my jeans
My team stay paid
Miami for a week
After Saint-Tropez
Ridin' through fillin' orders
At the Mandolay
And the fast lanes fun until you crash
When we purge we don't kill nah
We just cure hash and we take dabs
Rubber band wrap, hundred grand stacks
Still I throw it in a Safeway bag
I'm old school really, few suckas wanna kill me, why?
I just wanna live for my kids, and enjoy my high
Cookies crossback to that cherry pie
Grow room full of babies flowers 12 hour light
12 hour flight, I'm overseas
I'm in London rollin' cheese partyin' with freaks
Cold drinks and no sleep for a couple weeks
I play with the powder 'fore I touch the peak

[Hook: Devin the Dude]
Yeah, yeah, get high
Yeah just roll it up cause
Just one hit is like ooohh
It's some good shit ain't it?
Yeah them cookies don't be bullshitting man
Hey I got something else too, let me roll this up
Here check this out right here

[Verse 2: B-Real]
I got a dab on the nail, inhale
Got them flavors blowin' outta my lungs when I exhale
Man I'm ridin' on a cloud, hoverin' over the crowd
Hear me when I'm cheifin' homie you know we smokin' the loud
Slow creepin', but the high is heavy
Freefallin' like Tom Petty, you ain't ready
Let the Doctor write you a prescription for the medication that goes in me
Hesitation get the fuck out of our faces man you ain't about it
This fuckin' rooms crowded, my foot in your ass equals the room without it
Only for connoisseurs, smokin the pure sure BHO, I got the cure
And now you're elevated (get high) twist it up, 7 grams in my Raw classic
Yeah we do it all, we hittin' all bastards
We got the best products, pick up the phone, call up
If you're hittin' on my trees then pack a bowl up

[Hook: Devin the Dude]
You already know we be gettin' high (so high)
Just one hit is like ooohh
And it don't stop, we smoke around the clock
Everyday all day, matter of fact we ain't finished yet
Here's another one, here hit this

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
I've been smokin' weed yeah
Ever since thirteen
I know that ain't nothin to brag about bitch
But it's hard to smoke more than me
But I get a beer to equalize it
I wish they legalize it
All over the world more than half the people tried it
It's a medicine, it's good for ya
I wish that I can puff this stuff without needin' a lawyer around
In Texas man they're reckless they will hand you up for roaches
K-9 approaches, barkin' all ferocious
I know this but I smoke it on a day to day basis
Mind my business and stay out of their faces
Cause hey, some way, some day, we may follow
The marijuana laws like Cali and Colorado
And if we do? Shit we gonna throw a parade downtown
I be on the flow blowin' smoke to the stage

[Hook: Devin the Dude]
And you already we be gettin' high
Smokin' everyday nigga anytime
And just when you thought that was it
Man here come another quarter pound of some good shit
Time to roll up, we never slow up
Hold up man, here's another one for ya right here[Intro]
Yo, what's up where you at? (Leaving the club)
Meet me at the crib baby (Alright)
How many you got with you baby? (Three)
Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Alright)

*Phone rings* (Hello?)
What's up, where you at baby? (Leaving the spot)
Meet me at the crib baby (Okay)
How many you got with you? (Four)
Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Let's do it)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
After the club we usually go straight to Chubby's
That's where the 3 in the morning grub be
And even though Icons is lovely
Tonight the pad is gonna be a must see
Cause hussies are coming to give up they pussies, trust me
They comin' to muff me, plus three:
Makzilla, Irv and Big Nick we's 'bout to bust V
Open until we lust free, she sucked D
Gushed me, then roughly rode this ding-a-ling like a Huffy
Luck-ily, another 36 cup D abruptly, came into the room to fuck me
She said, "Tecca Nina touch me, your dick is thick and husky
It must be like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky"
Well, what do you know, baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy, unjustly I crushed, B!
And not one of these broads is ugly, 'til the next morning
When they crawl in they hubby Snuggie, looking rough as rugby

[Hook]
Yeah, we hit the spot if we choose her
Then she dipping out
To take her to my house (It's the afterparty)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your mama house
No but really (It's the afterparty)
And we all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Full of that liquor, ready to stick all this dick up in a-uh
Bitch out at Nina's, I never seen but I'm fixing to fuck
Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
"Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty
Tecca Nina I can't thank you enough for the afterparty

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
When freaks come out at night, the freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the afterparty, they got somebody take care of they baby
So it's cool, no rules, no security guards
Let your hair down, yeah, now do what you want
Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it

[Hook][Pimp C]
Uhh, you stayin' with that bitch, layin' with that bitch
Fuckin' all your paper off, playin' with that bitch
At first, all you want to do was fuck with the bitch
Years passed by, now you stuck with that bitch
Ya fighting mo' and mo' now you fed up with the bitch
But you knew that was a ho when you hooked up with the bitch
But you trusted the bitch, cause you lust for the bitch
Ya suck on the pussy and bust nuts in the bitch
Now she around this motherfucka pregnant and shit
But a child to a bitch, is seen as nothin' but a lic
The next thing you know the bitch gotcha in court
Tryin' to getcha paper, calling it "child support"
Takin' half of yo' shit, talkin' bout a divorce
If you don't know the game, then here's a crash course
They say "You live with the bitch, so ya common law married
And the bitch done got accustomed to the paper she been having"

(Hook: Devin the Dude)
Ain't that a bitch? (Pimp C: Ain't that a bitch?)
Ain't that a bitch?, now ask yourself ain't that a bitch?
Ain't that a bitch?

[Bun B]
I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened, and read it, it said "Fuck UGK
We've been watching your success ever since you niggas dropped
We would've spoke a long time, but we thought you would've flopped
Man, two niggas got some nuts, to graduate to mainstream status
From being two broke bastards from off the cuts, growing up in a town
Where population fifty thousand, only 3 high schools, but 8 sets of low-income housing
Look, when you two did "Too Hard To Swallow", we thought it was a fluke
When you boys came "Super Tight" we played it cool hand luke
"Ridin Dirty" went gold with no video, we gave a break
But this MTV award nomination shit just took the cake
So read this letter real good and take it as a warning
We'll be watching you when you sleep and when you wake up in the morning
The people that you running with and everything you do
Sincerely yours, signed, nigga you know motherfucking who." Ain't that a bitch?

[Hook]

[Devin the Dude]
And just when you thought that pussy was specially for you
You put all your trust in the bitch and guess what she do?
Round two in the mornin' that ho's gone
Then she come with some different clothes on
I guess the bitch is so fine, that you pay it no mind
You asked her where she been, she said "with one of her friends" that ho lying
Her pussy is a gold mine, well that how she feels
And she can get a few thangs in exchange for cheap thrills
The price of pussy is turning some women to whores
And just because they give you some pussy, it ain't yours
So I don't trip on it, but I'll stab if I can
Then wipe off my weapon, and turn into the traveling man
See like I fucked Ruby Tuesday, but Friday I'd had to slap that ho
The bitch got knocked up by Rosco, and said I'm the poppa though
In this game they got a name for a chick, who's gettin' rich for lickin' nuts and dick
Ain't that a bitch?

[Hook]Verse One:
Seventeen dollars all to my name
I had to spend two went to got me a drank
At a sto' fo' mo' for a box of squares
I seen a fine bitch I had to stop and stare
It was hot and she was walkin' in the scorching sun
I said, "Get in pretty girl I don't want you to burn."
She said she lives across town and needed a ride
I would have took her but this gas is too highhhhh
I kept flippin'
I kept dippin'
I can't be wasting my time
Went to the tre for a dime
Now, I got a dollar left
Might as well give it to somebody else, I can help
Tried to hand it to a brother
He said, "Man, you need more than this mothafucka"

Chorus:
The almighty dollar
It ain't what it used to be
Hobos used to asked you for a dollar
Now the motherfuckers ask you for three
The almighty dollar
Well that's what they used to say
One dollar used to be a whole lot, but it's hardly worth shit today

[Devin talking]
Well shit, give me my dollar back nigga
When I'm in the tre I might as well go buy T.S.U
See what these fine girls do around here
Go by Frenchy's and smell me some chicken or something
Damn, what are all these helicopters and shit doin' around this mothafucka?

Continue my journey with the AC off
Smoke rushin' out the window every time I cough
I swang to the right and let the police pass
The nigga tryin' to get away, them laws on his ass
But I'm glad it ain't me
Aw naw, not now
I'm tryin' to rise, tryin' to climb
Don't want to fall back down
So I put the sweet out and wait until I arrive
Treat it like an hour later because I'm already highhhhhh
I had no need for fronting
Ain't even try to be funny
Nigga got to have money
Some of us love it
Some of us hate it
Some of us need it
Almighty dollar

Chorus
Outro:
[Clerk] Hello. How you do?
[Devin] Yeah what's up man? Let me get ah, two cigarillos
Two gallons of gas, and these two Budweisers right here
[Clerk] Oh, two Budweisers. Fifteen dollar
[Devin] Say what?
[Clerk] Fifteen dollar
[Devin] Man you bullshittin' man
[Clerk] No, fifteen dollar you got two...
[Devin] Naw, naw naw. Get me get, one gallon of gas
One cigarillo and just one Budweiser then fuck it[VERSE 1]
Lord thank you for the food that I'm about to receive
May it nourrish my body and keep my mind at ease
But as far as my soul I been meanin to holler atcha
And I know you been busy with niggas steady tryina catch ya
Gotta get somethin off my mind for a while
Cause when problems start to pile it gets kinda hard to smile
But I - keep my head up
And try to hold on until my kids all grown
I know one day that could be me lyin there in a hearse
So I hope for the best, prepare for the worst
Swearin I curse, but really there's no harm done
Just havin fun, but there's some who wanna take it and run
I left a life of lootin and thievin, and shit
Because my friends and my family was leavin me quick
It seems everything is happenin without me knowin
Tryina stay sane, but mayn, this shit has got me goin

[Hook]
{Randy-Ran:}
Goin crazy
Feelin like I'm feelin
But it's gonna be alright
Alright
Alright

I'm goin crazy
Feelin like I'm feelin
But it's gonna be alright
Alright
Alright
Alright

[VERSE 2]
It's hard to keep away from sin, but you know I try
And hopefully I get it together before I die
Thinkin the drank can ease my pain and tough luck
But when I finish, it just leaves me craned and fucked up
Call my folks to tell em how I feel
Before I get to speak they tell me someone else got killed
Slowly but surely they're goin one at a time
I wish you could rewind and show em some kind of sign
I realize I put my life on the line just bein born
Gotta git up, git out, no time to be snorin
And just play with the cards I'm dealt
And if I lose I won't blame nobody else
Cause it's all about survival and the strongest survive
But even the strongest won't make it alive
Cause death sneaks up from behind without you knowin
And just the thought of it has got me goin

[Hook]

[VERSE 3]
We are livin on a see-sawer
And when we fall it hurts
We can't get up from the dirt
Like lotto you got a different number picked daily
Here one day, and gone the next, this shit crazy
Now I gotta work on gettin my brain back together
Be ready for whatever, rain and bad weather
Had never seen so many dark clouds around
A lotta strange looks and smiles turned to frowns
Maybe one day it'll all make sense
When everybody's chillin on that other side of the fence
But for now I just leave it up to the keeper
Be thankful for what he gave me, chill out and smoke some reefer
Set all my problems aside for a few
Before I lose my cool, do somethin I don't wanna do
Because I seen frustrations frequently flowin
All I need is your strenght to keep me from goin

[Hook]Anythang is plenty man and is better than an nothin at all
Anythang is plenty man
Anythang is plenty man and is better than an nothin at all
Anythang is plenty man

You ain't the only one who got problems
You ain't the only one who knows pain
Get up off your ass and just solve them
You still got a chance to try to change - try this shit again

[Refrain]
Really ain't no need for self pity
Cryin when there's no one else around
Life I know sometimes can get shitty
Even shittier when sleepin on the ground - no need to complain

[Refrain]

[Interlude]

[Refrain]

You ain't the only one who got problems
You ain't the only one who knows pain

Really ain't no need for self pity
Cryin when there's no one else around
Life I know sometimes can get shitty
Even shittier when sleepin on the ground - no need to complain

[Refrain]

Nothin at all - nothin at all - anything is plenty man

Oooh-ooooh-oooh-oo-ooh

Oooh-ooooh-oooh-oo-ooh
Take a sip of this, and just let it relax your mind
Oooh-ooooh-oooh-oo-ooh
Please do not disturb, on the door you see that sign

[Hook]
Oooh-ooooh-oooh, I'm really feeling you

And this is what we'll do I'll, be your number two
I can let you feel on me, if you just let me feel on you
Oooh-ooooh-oooh, I know you got a man
Your undercover lover, I can be your back up plan
And we can just pretend we're, nothing more than friends
The sex will never end, that way everybody wins

[Chamillionaire]
Their dorms their college, their brains share knowledge
I tip toe through the back do', and no one gon hear about it
And if your boo try to search you, in any clue get spotted
I hope the lipstick, that is smeared on your top lip is not it
Naw we don't sip Hypnotic, we sipping Henny and some Crimevicts
So take a sip of this, and just let it relax your mind
Your body's calling me informing me, that you're freakier than normally
Birthday suit has been worn for me, latex condom put on for me
Protection in the briefcaser, plenty of lead with no eraser
Trojan Man gotta be safer, ladies that plot for my treat paper
Watching a man while he chase her, trying to figuer out whether she faithful
But the minute that he takes her, break them C-H-I-C taker
He running round like he gangsta, don't think your girl can't get lead
To the edge of the bedspread, hungry for sex she can get fed
Spread her legs or get fed head, she's wearing that yellow pink thong
She's got her wedding ring on, but it still never seems wrong, Koopa

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
See getting money's like sex, and I'm having a manage G
Gold diggers can't F' with me, like I'm having a manage me
A ho see the ice and she start tripping, like your broad can't skeet
Koopa get a hot steamy ain't creamy, but uh-naw it ain't T
If it's her first time with me, she'll do her thang like she knew me
Can't stand a booshie ho, a booshie ho can't enthuse me or amuse me
Can't stand a groupie, cause a groupie's purpose is usually to use me
They usually hop on the next dick, when they see 50 Cent or Juve
Who he that's Koopa, but he look like 50 Cent oh yeah
Well G-G-G-G-ge-ge-ge-get the hell out of here yeah
If this ain't just about the sex, don't waste your time
Money jewelry and fame, should be the last thing on your mind
You steady trying to be like them, Chamillion trying to be like Ben Franklin
Cause a girl that I think is feeling me, say she like him aaah
Don't worry naw, Koopa not disappointed
I look to' as the do', stick my finger out like this and point it
Leave, with me it's a ghetto version of Girls Gone Wild
Niggas probably heard our sound, gotta use a very large towel
To stick under the do' she's moaning, trying to wake up any sleep takers
Screaming obscenities at me, she got a foul mouth like she T. Draper
Sheet shaker heat maker, wanna be down then I replace her
Cameras'll get your cart I'm smart, you will not ever see the taper
What we did let me lace ya, up in some game while she take a
Sip of the Henny or a skeet taste of, some of this Rum minus the chaser yeah

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
I got some Henn got some Crime, got some Remmy and it's time
To take a sip of this, and just let it relax your mind
Your body is so fine, girl I'm peeping your design
Somehow it feels right, tell me how can I decline
Please do not disturb on that door, you see that sign
There'll be no interrupting, something freaky on my mind
Sipping going doo-own, stripping going doo-own
She know what's on my mii-ind, I'm ready to bump and grii-ind
Oooh-ooooh-ooo-oooh, oooh-ooooh-oooh-ooooh
Oooh-ooooh-ooo-oooh, oooh-ooooh-oooh-ooooh

[Devin the Dude]
Your man use to fuck you down, but now he's slacked up
She's running all over town, I think he's gonna need back up
I'll be your relief pitcher, dick up in your mitt
There's no cork off in my bat, so it's somewhat illegal hit
Boom over the fence, rinse off my balls when I'm finished
Yes she's probably a good sport, but he's got you playing tennis
Running after balls, dodging all your calls
You're horny wanna grind him, but you just can't find him
So here's what you do, call 832-567
You remember the rest, just ask for Devin
Yes I'll come quick, but not too soon
Leaving nutty rubbers, all over the room
Don't forget to bring the pill, the dress I like and high heels
Some extra panties if you will, we can chill
I'll never wanna come between you and him, understand
But if you ever need a back up plan, I'm your man

[Hook][Lil' Keke]
Body rock or start rocking, if you rocking it now
Tell the DJ start mixing, if he chopping it now
Look at me, I'm so fresh so clean
Digital TV screen, got me lighting up the scene
Look at me, I'm steady running with G's
Rolling on them 21's, 22's and 3's
We got the drank the dro, plus the alcohol
For my people who be ready to ball, come on
Let's hit the flo' and let it go, 'fore I start the show
Get your back up off the wall, come on
Start club hopping, in the city where it's popping
A lot of bodies rocking, a lot of women flocking
Trying to kick it, they rolling with the niggas with the tickets
I make my cash flow, jump up a whole digit
Look at me, I graduated a G
Now put your hands in the air, so the crowd can see

[Hook]
(you feeling good), then body rock with me
Go on represent your hood, and body rock with me
All the independent women, come and rock with me
Get your hands up high, so the crowd can see

Coming straight up off the streets, it ain't no stopping Ke'
Real G's, body rock with me
Put your sets in the air, so the crowd can see

[Devin the Dude]
And that's the only way to do it round here, is to have fun
Some niggas got drank some got sweets, some have blunts
And yep I'm one of the ones, my lungs hold tons of weed
Smoking with niggas like Snoop, Ke', Bun B
Yukmouth, D'Angelo there's more on the menu
I can keep naming people, but I'm not fin to
Cause I'm here to have a good time, body rock
I'll probably hop out on the flo', just to let you hoes know
That I can go way back, cabbage patch bitch what
I bust a windmill, backspin then get up
Start body rocking again, side to side hop and spin
That move didn't get no pussy from you, but it got your friend
Out here dancing, with her hands in the air
Waving em, like she just don't care
Yeah letting the crowd see, letting herself be free
Letting her body rock, with me

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
Here comes the go-getter, yeah the quick lick hitter
The dope rhyme spitter, you wanna take a picture
Let me hit ya, sky page two way style
I'm a gangsta, that's trying to keep a low profile
With a pen and a paper, trying to pull a caper
Me and Mr. Lee, and a nice big plate of
Beats, so we keep on crushing the streets
Laid up in some'ing lovely, in a first class suite
Trying to smoke a fat sack, body rock and all that
Alert the Nextel walkie talkie, get right back
I give it to em, and at the same time do em
I mix em slow em down, so that means I'm trying to screw em
So it's lights out, baby what you tal'n bout
Bout to turn out the party, get it crunk no doubt
All the independent women, go on shake it to death
Get your hands in the sky, if you feeling yourself uh

(*talking*)
You feeling good, say man check it out

Ain't nobody got no more weed its time to smoke
Keep that beat rollin, you see everybody's holdin they own
You know I got to bust at least 2 or 3 before I'm gone
But theres always 1 in the crowd rappin loud

Don't know nothin bout the South tryin to find someone to hang wit
Man when you finish flowin, or whatever the fuck you doin
Holla at me I'll be in the bathroom boo boo'n

Had to get away needed some time to chill
So thought of 59 and got behind the wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill I'll be drivin a while
Takin 2 or 3 pulls every 5 or 6 miles
I can't wait to see my road dogs you know how we do it
Just like a case of beer piece of cotton, run right through it
And all the bitches know me I hit quite a few they be glad to see me Niggas don't give 'em dick like I do

The briar patch
No donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Please donâ€™t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in

I hop, I jump, I skip through the rubble
Yo, me ainâ€™t looking for trouble
I was just trying to get to the other end, I never been
Maybe then I can tell my friends how it is. Iâ€™ve been
Searching for someone to help me, maybe you can
But itâ€™s hard to tell you how I feel when you got a knife in your hand
You can carve me, tie me up and starve me
Put me on the grill, still nothing can harm me
Like the briar patch
Donâ€™t chunk me in
What kind of luck would I have then?
Wait a minute man, before you put me in it use the gun
That you got, a couple of bullets, Iâ€™ll be finished â€“ done
Or hey, I can help you find a pot
Help you build a fire, help you get it good and hot
Well, unless you like to eat me cold
You can but oh no
Please donâ€™t throw me in

The briar patch
No donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Please donâ€™t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in

Youâ€™s an ugly motherfucker, dog, I just call it like I see it
And your breath is like death, if you donâ€™t like it so be it
I get mistreated by others if you cut for me or not
Slice off my toes if thatâ€™s how it goes I really donâ€™t give a fuck
If all of this belongs to you, do what you do, go â€˜head

But throw me in the briarâ€™s patch and youâ€™ll never see so much red
I bled from less than just trespassing cuz, Iâ€™m just asking for a favor
Excuse my rude behavior
Iâ€™m just trying to savor the flavor of the fruit I just picked
And if you donâ€™t like it, you can suck my dick

But what you donâ€™t do is throw me in the briar patch and then Iâ€™m through
Come on man, canâ€™t we call a truce
Can we do somethin about it before people end up crying and shoutin and poutin
Man, come on man, now that would really hurt â€¦

The briar patch
No donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Please donâ€™t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me in the briar patch
Donâ€™t throw me inI pick you up
I look you up and down
You so fine
In my mind I'm sayin'
Now how can I make this ho mine
I got the tank on F
I got a bag full of herb
Your favorite drink in the holder
The restaurant song reserved
They got smothered shit
And other shit I can't even pronounce
But I can count
I know the weed I have is less than an ounce
We ride and we talk
We joke and we laugh
And we drinkin'
While I'm thinkin'
Bout pokin' that ass
And at last
We pulled up in front of
The restaurant-a
Ah yea Benihanas
Chose a table by the window
So we can look at the stars and shit
He made our plate
We ate, got back in the car and dipped
But on the way home I tried to grab your hand and put it on my bone
You pulled back and said "go on boy"

[Hook]
Girl, this dick is so clean
This dick is so clean that you can boil it in some collard greens
Girl, this dick is so clean
Girl, this dick is so clean that you can serve it with some lima beans
This dick is so clean
This dick is so clean that you can boil it in some collard greens
Girl this dick is so clean
It'll probably go good with your broccoli and cheese

Tell me why, oh why
You won't let me get between them thighs
Tell me when
Ya gonna open up and let me in
You got all kind of excuses
And you used to niggas trippin'
They just want your body
I know that ain't what you givin'
On the first date or whatever
But it's the third time we been together
And it seems like girl you're forever
You're forever mine
Aww because it gets better with time
Oh girl
You got what I want
I got what you need
At least let me smell it
Just get a whiff of that pussy
You be thinkin' I stick this dick up in hoes at random
Come on girl that ain't how I handle 'em
I mind my manners
And uh

[Hook]

I gave you roses
Even chocolate candy
Tell me what else should I do to get you out of them panties
Spend time, I tried to
Just count the things that I do
A couple of dollars for your ass
Hold that girl, I got you
And I'm even willing to pump it
You need a boost I'll jump it
I'll use my hand to unscrew your off-hand(?) and jump it myself
I'd like to help you with your sexual needs
And if I put this thing in you girl
I bet you will see
That it's good
If down the line you ever find a disease
And don't know who gave you the shit
You didn't get it from me
Cause see

[Hook][Intro: Slim Thug]
Thugga
Sound like some Snoop shit
We making some Thug shit

[Verse: Slim Thug]
I'm one deep in that 'lac laid back, cruising
Came a long way from that north side of Houston
I'd never know one day I'd make it out of this trap
Or that I'd get rich off of making up a rap
Momma watching TV, brother cooking crack
Sister 14 and pregnant and that's facts
All my life and shoot and said night
But instead of being scared, I'm trying see the fight
We used to it cause everyday they do it
Momma thinking we dead, about to lose it
Always been a boss, never took orders
Good thing, unlike my other partners, I was smarter
When they was getting locked up, I'm grinding more harder
Half on the block, the other half on recorders
And who knew one day folks would use it
To ride and get high to, it's that cadillac music

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
It's the Cadillac music
And I hope that you can use it
If you don't have a Fleetwood
You can jam it in your Hooptie
Put it in and just ride, ride, ride
Put it in and just ride, ride, ride

[Verse: Devin The Dude]
Now this is the type of shit you have a slight lean when you ride to
Especially if you got some tight weed like I do
Cadillac creeping with the fresh brown leather
Old school simply cause the shit sound better
Seventies, just leave them be
You feeling the vibe - Ah Ah Stayin' Alive
Ohio player type shit, sugar pudding
Scooping up fine freaks fuck wuggah woofin
And I'm looking for a spot where I can chill and whatnot
When they ain't tripping on me smoking on the kill that I've got
And that's every club parking lot here that's jumping
I roll up, say hold up, bitch, stop bumping and get in
Take a spin with your boy in the Caddy
Guess I'm just a player, not a pimp, I'm not your daddy
Just a nigga that'll put some dick in ya
And I know that you can use it while you're listening to Cadillac music

[Hook: Devin The Dude]

[Verse: Dre Day]
Uh, uh, cheyeah
Why these laws keep harrassing?
They ain't got nothin better to do than put us blacks and
Ese's

[Hook: Devin The Dude X4]

...ride, ride, ride[Verse 1 - Devin The Dude]
I'm Puffin'
I never get enough in
I never cook coke up on the stovetop
But I'm stuffin' these nuts up in the guts of a slut no doubt
But it's trapped inside a rubber
Should I flush that ho out?
To use again? Well it depends do I have another one
I cuss for fun
Too cool to have to buss a gun
I don't have to duck and run
I could fuck a bum up quick
But that's some tenth grade shit
And it's all about chillin', smilin', laughin'
So you know I'm willin', hollin', and I'm grabbin'
At a freak before I leave best believe I'm weeded
You rollin that billie jean bitch BEAT IT!
And you see that we the niggas who smoke the most
People propose a toast from coast to coast
But it don't even matter whose the highest
Cause if it ain't dope
Their ain't no hope
They ain't gone buy it

[Verse 2 - Curren$y]
Yeeeaaah
Quarter tank of gas in my seven one double S
Quarter bag mostly shake but this'll have to do I guess
GPS loaded with the coordinates
Of this bitch crib to receive love and nourishment
In the form of joints rolled, Drinks poured
Her in nothing but a robe, playin her roll
I saw the mack when I was only 11 years old
And I swore to never be a simp for a ho
Approach the closed do'
It crack open before my eyes
Shorty with a doobie of her own I am not surprised
Cause I don't kick it on the low
With no bitches that don't get high
Wrap me a to go plate and ask if I want her to drive
Cause I got far too much on my mind
Industrial size gears I'm caught in a grind
At your grandma's house
Plastic cover the couch
Before I sit down
She question me for smellin' like a pound[Devin the Dude]
III'm puffin, I never get enough in
I never cooked coke up on the stove top but I'm stuffin'
These nuts up in the guts of a slut no doubt
But its trapped inside a rubber should I flush that ho out
To use again, well it depends, do I have another one
I cuss for fun, too cool to have to bust a gun
I don't have to duck and run, I could fuck a bum up quick
But thats some tenth grade shit
And its all about chillin', smilin', laughin'
So you know I'm willin', hollerin' and I'm grabbin'
At a freak before I leave, best believe I'm weeded
You rollin' that billy jean, bitch beat it
And you see that we the niggas who smoke the most
People propose a toast, from coast to coast
But it don't really matter who's the highest
If it ain't dope, there's no hope they ain't gone buy it

[Curren$y]
Quarter tank of gas in my 71 double S
Quarter bag, mostly shake, but this will have to do I guess
GPS loaded with the coordinates
Of this bitch crib to receive love and nourishment
In the form of joints rolled, drinks poured
Her in nothin' but a robe, playin her role
I saw "The Mack" when I was only 11 years old
And I swore, to never be a simp for a ho
Approached the closed door, it cracked open before my eyes
Shorty wit a doobie of her own, I am not surprised
Cuz I don't kick it on the low, wit no bitch that don't get high
Wrap me a to-go plate and ask if I want her to drive
Cuz I got far too much on my mind
Industrial size gears, I'm caught in the grind
At yo grandma house
Plastic cover the couch
Before I sit down
She pressurin' me for smellin' like a pound[Hook]
I can't wait
I can't wait 'til you get old enough
I'm being patient
But I can't wait 'til you get old enough
So I can cutcha'
So I can cutcha' up

You look so young
But still look good
The way the sun is shining on you
And I would if I could
Try to take a little piece of you and break you off
But you're not quite ready
I got to hold steady
And try to control myself
Cause if I start on you now there'll be nothing left
I can't help it
I guess it's just the way you smell
You're growing up fast and quite well
You're looking kind of thirsty
Let me give you some water
But not too much
You know what? We oughtta
Just move
And get away from it all
Cause if people see us together
You know that they'll call the laws
And try to keep us apart
It's you and me from the start
You got the key to my heart
You taste sweet yet tart
When I hit it
But right now I can't get it
But when you come of age
We'll go our separate ways

[Hook]

Some folks think I ain't right
They try to label me
But I can't wait to lay you on the table see
When I'm in the mood I think of you
Wishing that I can hold you while I drink a brew
It's true a love like this never exists long
As soon as you get grown
I know you're gonna get gone
In the wind somewhere
But that's how life goes
But for now let's take picture together
Uhh.. nice pose
I'm tired of hiding
I want everybody to see
How we get along so happily
You and me
Need to go somewhere where the penalty lessens
When they something like you in my possession
I could leave you alone
But I wouldn't feel right
And if they lock me up for it
We'll be still tight
I know you can't write
But I'll be back
To pull you by the hairs and lay you in the sack

[Hook]

[Fading]
Yeah... but you know I ain't going nowhere
I'll be right here you know
Shit, I like the way you make me feel
Ain't nuttin' wrong with spending a little time, energy
I gotta make sure that you're well nourished
Yeah... you 'bout ready
Let's get in the closet, I'm gonna turn the lights down
I'm gonna turn them off
And turn you upside down[Hook]
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way?

You probably don't have a big ol house on the hill
But if you did just imagine how would it feel
If your phone got disconnected, no cash, and ya gas cut off
And the gal that you had that was helping just stepped the fuck off
She took the kid, the dog, and the kitty
And everybody know you're at a low they feel pity
And what's really fucked up is now you're just normal
No more hoes, no more clothes, can't go to the show cuz it's formal
And you wonder why why why why why
And you resort to gettin high
But damn, you can't find ya stash
And you never took the time to ask yourself

[Hook] w/ scratches: "Don't front, don't front"

You probably don't have a lot of money
But if you did would you find it funny
If you lent, and you spent it, and you didn't invest
Or put it in the bank so it can gain some interest
You just went and got the biggest car you could find
And a couple more just like it so your friends can follow behind
Never mind how much it costs, you copped the best weed to smoke
And for her a fur coat
You got jet skis and boats
And next thing you're broke (damn)
And the yacht that you got, it won't sail or float
You look back and try to catch someone's attention for help
You made a right at the light and they made a left and you ask yourself

[Hook]

Why they do me that way
Yeah
Hey hey hey
Ain't no more doobies in the tray
What you gonna do when the people go home (home home home)
{*scratches: "Don't front"*}
Wanna smoke some weed but the reefer's all gone (gone gone gone)
{*scratches: "Don't front"*}
What you gonna do when your friends go home {*"Don't front"*}
And you wanna drink a beer but your end's all gone (gone gone gone)
{*scratches: "Don't front"*}
All gone {*"Don't front"*}

Uh-oh. Hehe. Shit I think I found...
I found a...
Hey! I found a bag of weed. And it...{*breathes in*}
Smells pretty motherfuckin' good {*exhales*}
I'mma call up some more partnas man, finna smoke
Bring the cigars nigga {*"Don't front"*}
{*singing*} Ooooo Yeaaaahh Heeeey Heyy Hey Heeeeeyyya Yeyah
Told ya I can't sing man, I just be in here bullshittin'Hallelujah, kids hear this
Devin's got some shit wouldn't give a fuck if you dissed
Because shit to each's own and each owns voice
You can be stealin killin or chillen whateva your choice
Smoke some weed smoke ya pipe fuck it
Life if how you live it
I grab tha mic while tha DJ groove it (turntable scratch noise)
Explicit lyrics is what um known to kick
Trying to make money so I can make honeys blow on mah dick
I go on a quick mission to find some kil'
Ain't no big deal, just hop in tha Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
Wake up in tha morning and I have weed still and I chill
With tha brothas sippin coffee
Too old to be listenin' into what you say so ho get off me
You're born in this world by ya self and you die alone
So as long as ya grown ya might as well gone and just

(Chorus)
Do what tha fuck you wanna do (Go ahead and just)
Say what tha fuck you wanna say

What did it all mean?
Say what you want ho ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you wanna do

Now everybody's got elders and you should respect um
They been through similar shit but then again you can't let um
Put they hands on ya life like a remote control
Have you travelin down tha same bumpy tore up road
Now close friends and relatives they should be constantly by ya side
And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There'll finally come a time for ya self you must decide
Cause you only get a ticket might as well enjoy tha ride and just

(Chorus)

And there's a couple of fucked up man made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize you just might not wake up tomorrow
And tha dollar you earn is tha dolla you spend
Go get sumthin for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin
Is it a sin? I 'ont (don't) know
What X and O's in this game
Tryin to survive, tryin to get high, tryin to get by and stay alive
So (Do it till ya satisfied) Not just a lil bit
But wait until ya eighty and start sayin what you couldda did

But what did it all mean?
Say what you want ho ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you wanna do

Chorus fades outTu esta muy bonita

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, you sho look mighty fine when you walk my way
Say lady, I sho wish there was somethin I could say
That booty, I truly wish that I could speak your language
Cause I really don't know how to explain it

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nalgas

[Verse 2]
So mannish, the thoughts that goes & stops inside my head
My spanish, it's so bad I don't know what the fuck I said
Excuse me, senorita I'm just tryna find the words
To let you know I like the way your booty curves

[Hook]

(break)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So authentic, the way you move those hips when the music plays
All off in it, I'll groove if I could be with you today
"No comprende," is all I get when I ask you to dance
I really wanna feel what's in them pants, girl

[Hook] repeat w/ ad-libbing until the end[Intro] [Rob Quest speaking]
Yeah. This goes out to whom it may concern
But anyway
Check it out

[Verse One] [Rob Quest]
Sittin' in the next room talkin' softly on the telephone
Makin' plans to see ya soon when I know I'm dead wrong
Why oh why must I continue to be a ho
When I got a fine yellow bow-legged bitch at the crizzo?
She know jizza, guess I was only out to get paid
This girl was cuttin' for daddy like a Mexican with a switchblade
But anyway, peep it loc
Here's how the story went
Second week in July, I think um
Tuesday the 10th
Around 4 p.m
With this bitch named Kim
She wasn't all that in the face but she had her own place
I got caught up in temptation, now here's what I'm facin'
The situation's thick, I'm steadily thinkin' with my dick
And I'm constantly askin' myself
Like, should I rush this ho?
But you know
Damn, little did I know
She was my best friend's sister's cousin auntie mother niece
Up on my daddy's side, I couldn't even lie
My girl start buggin'
Illin'
Riffin'
Trippin'
She gave my face a smack, now she's got a busted lip
And says I overreacted
Now it's her things that she's packin'
Hey yo baby, apologize
Now I realize
Hmm
I knew exactly how she felt
That's why I'm sittin' at the crib by my god damn self
The reason why, because I had to trick
Now I'm breakin' my back
Tryin' to suck my own dick

[Hook] [Devin]
When you're fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
Fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

[Verse Two] [Mugg Jugg]
Okay now check it, I met this gal, she got it goin' on
Every time I see this bitch she's all up on a nigga's bone
I told the bitch I had a woman and a little girl
She's diggin' in my pants, grabbin' my nuts like a fuckin' squirrel
So what was I to do? me and my woman had trust
But I was thinkin' how many nuts I can bust
In this ho
I hit the pussy fast, hit the pussy slow
She whipped out her tongue and licked the Jugg up his asshole
She couldn't call the crib when she wanted some cock
So she would beep and I would sneak
We would meet at the bus stop
And then I called her to my crib one day
Because my daughter was at the daycare and my gal was at the jay
We got's to hurry up and bone, my girl get home at 5:30
She knew somethin' was funny
So she came home early
And all that moanin' and groanin'
I couldn't listen
She busted in and caught me in a 69 position

[Hook] [Devin]
When you're fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
Fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

[Verse Three] [Devin The Dude]
Me and my gal, we been apart for a while
Yeah, I miss her kiss and I kinda miss her smile
But I'm the one who fucked up
Walkin' round with a big head
She made me feel like I had a gold-plated dick head
But I was tryin' to fuck everything that moved and breathed
She never checked or suspect
There was somethin' up a nigga sleeve
Yeah, my baby she trusted me
She never even cussed at me
Except that Friday night when she busted me
I found a letter on the dresser that said:
'Tell your bitches don't be leavin' they panties in my bed'
And I was laughin' and shit
When she left, at first
But in a couple of weeks that shit started to hurt
Now it's been six months
And when she call all she do is talk cold to me

[Hook] [Devin]
Fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
Fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy{Scarface}

Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

Chorus:

You must be used to all the finer thangs
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

{Too $hort}

I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But everytime I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

Repeat Chorus:

{Devin}

Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know thats my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuch her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my sidee
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and onlly
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

Repeat Chorus:

{Tela}

I got a call from Laquesha and some of her neices
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fuckin for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my suprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn ho I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases

Devin:
You know what I'm saying baby
It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin Scarface in style

Repeat Chorus
