[Intro: Bobby Vinton]
Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my owwnnn
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my owwnnn
I'm so lonely

[Bridge]
Yo, this one here
Goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, dog
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin, for her I was feenin
So I had to take a little ride
Back tracking on these few years
Trynna figure out what I do to make it go bad
Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin' and I'm so

[Hook]
Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl
I'm so lonely

[Verse 2]
Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right cause
Without you in my life girl I'm so

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one on the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out, baby)
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin me crazy cause I'm so

[Hook]

[Outro]
So lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)
Mr. Lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)
So lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)

Mr. Lonely[Intro : Akon]
Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, because she be that lady

[Hook : Akon] x2
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!

[Hook]
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Ooh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a lil' drink on, They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, shes like "YOU'RE -"
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playin', Akon

[Hook: Akon] x2
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

[Verse 3: Akon]
Eminem is rollin', d and 'em rollin' bo
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just hoeing, big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be all in them and throwing "D"
Hitting no less than "Three"
Block wheel style like "Whee"
Girl I can tell you want me because lately

[Hook][Intro: Akon]
As life goes on
I'm startin to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sittin home just wishin we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

[Hook: Akon]
I understand there are some problems
And I'm not to blind to look
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can apologize for bein wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin to stay busy 'til you heard from dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a theif
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryin to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen gettin shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out disgracin my name
I'm just a singer tryin to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame

Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me[Produced by DJ Khalil & Danny Keyz]

Roll up, wait a minute

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now this that puff, puff, pass shit, Cheech and Chong glass shit
Blunts to the head, kush pillows no mattress
Speed boat traffic, bitches automatic
Cross that line, fuck around and get yo ass kicked
We roll shit that burn slow as fucking molasses
Probably won't pass it, smoke it 'til the last hit
Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch
Andre 3001, another classic
Go ahead, ask him bitches, 'bout how I be smokin' out
Party all night, yeah its goin' down

Nigga, better than my last batch, caramel complexion and her ass black
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)

[Hook: Akon]
I know you tryna get high, type of shit that have ya leaning sideways

No need to fly to Jamaica,  quarter ganja, we can get the same thing
You want that bom bom biggy, holla at my niggie, right here in LA
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)

[Bridge]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Still I am, tighter than the pants on Will.I.Am
Backthrow, back still, I have a pound in my backpack
Next to where the swishas at, smoking presidential
Got some bubba, I give me that, need it for my cataracts
Four hoes and I'm the pimp, in my Cadillac
You can tell them Cali back, matter fact, they a know
This ain't Dro, get a whiff of that
No, it ain't no seeds in my sack, you ain't never gotta ask, dog
What he smokin' on? Shit, kush till my mind gone
What you think I'm on? Eyes low, I'm blown
High as a motherfucker, there ain't no question 'bout it
Niggas say smoke me out, yeah I really doubt it
I'm Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded
So if you want it, you know yo nigga homie
You can put it in a zag or a blunt and get blunted
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)

[Hook]

[Outro: Sly]
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make yo ass choke
Hold up wait a minute, you can go put it back
Cuz what you got in yo sack boy, it ain't that[Intro: Akon]
Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Oh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhhhh {*4X*}

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, all niggas know what the fuck is, man
Young Khalifa man, heheheheh... uh
I done stayed on top of my game, gained control of my lane
Paid so much for my frames, put these lil niggas to shame
Ordered so many of them bottles, so many of them bottles you would think I am insane
Already changed the game once I done told you but now I'm gonna do it, and now I'm gonna do it again
Tell the club owners we need more sections
I made these lil niggas go cop they Rolexes
You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers
And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces
Hundred grand in a rubber band
Use to be the kid, now homie I'm the man
Hundred grand in a rubber band
I used to be the kid, but now homie I'm the man

[Hook: Akon]
Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go homie
You know they can't see what we see homie
Difference from the real and make believe homie
So let it go, let it go, let it go

[Wiz Khalifa]
Living my life about peace; sharing this money
And trying to get all my niggas up off of them streets; used to look up to some niggas
But now it all seem that it come down to me; make sure my family gon' eat
Grinding from up underneath, now they just say I'm a, now they just say I'm a beast
And now all these haters looking at me pitifully
Cause I'm the shit, literally
And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school
I say fuck the new car, I cop the old school

[Hook]

[Interlude: Akon]
Let it go, let it go, let it go
So let them go, let them go, let them go-oooo
Let them know-ooow
Let them know-ooow, let them know-ooow

[Wiz Khalifa]
This time I feel like its now or never
And going nowhere so no matter what they say I'll be here forever
Even though some folks will make it so you can't win
Don't need to take it on the gin; remember homie you ain't even gotta hold it in

ONIFC.. TGOD[Intro: Wyclef Jean] (Lil Wayne)
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She whined for the bill
Grind for the bill
(Weezy...and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought, he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She bawls, he'd call (where my money at?)

[Hook: Akon]
Cause I'mma tell you, like Wu told me :
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)

[Verse 2: Akon]
Pimpin' got harder cause, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shaking for some dub
Get triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real guerillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

[Hook]

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Whatever, now she like sour amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him, "Where my money at?"

[Hook]

[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill (And she used to be sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill (where my money at?)

(Lil Wayne: Where my money at?)[Produced by StreetRunner & DJ Khaled]

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't trying to stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm stunned thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

[Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzer's
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

[Bridge 2: Anthony Hamilton]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, ohh-ohh ohhh
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grab him, he take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in a bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge 3: Akon]
My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day

[Hook: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

[Bridge 4: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cooooold), a cold cold world

[Hook x2: Akon]

[Breakdown: Akon]
Ohh-ohhhh-ohhh-whooooa
Ohh-ohhhhh (ohh-ohhhh) ohh-ohhhhh

[Bridge 2: Anthony Hamilton]

[Outro: John Legend]
I won't surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no[Hook x2: Akon]
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tool on deck, why would I lie?
Nigga you a pussy, hope you got 9 lives
I can hit a nigga with the 9, 9 times
Country ass boy, country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil Weezyana
Everybody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill poppin' animal, syrup sippin' nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fucking antenna
You fucking with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The 9 give me brains but the AK add liver
The rapper is insane flowing like a mad river
Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho, hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her?
Her name is 9 millimeter

[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Banner]
If I got 9 slugs, 9 bullets gone fly
If I got a red beam, 9 people gone die
9 mamas gone cry, 9 spirits in the sky
9 preachers preaching, 9 sermons telling 9 lies
Cause each and every one of y'all 9 niggas wasn't shit
I would have rather kept the 9 rugers in the ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the 9 let 9 spit
I lick em all like eighteen tits on 9 chicks
I'm a suicide risk, 9 slits on each wrist
If I die 9 times the next go-arounds a bitch
And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows
And shove 9 inches of dick in 99 hoes

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a west coast original, black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang
You better stop that, mang
Fat mouth to Dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm killing like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah, I'm a killa, I ain't here to lock up
I flash the heater, then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggas always acting hard
I keep a 9 millimeter in my waist and got 2 more in the car
Yeah you're all about to get it so quit it, tryin' to conceal it
You'll fuck around and make me reveal it, so killas kill it

[Hook x2][Akon
So soft and slow
The way she move got me spendin my dough and yo
If you would have seen what I seen on that pole, just know

[Akon]
That I was wrong for fallin in love (love)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
Said I was wrong for fallin in love (love don't do it yo)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
But I just went against the grain

It was a feelin I can't explain, and it felt like harmony
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me everyday
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de

Look at me, I'm stuck
The bubble in her pants got me caught up, I never had no luck
Thinkin with the wrong head got me jumpin that now with no glove
It feels so good it had me sprung out on that stuff, now I'm stuck

That's what I get for fallin in love (love)
That's what I get for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
That's what I get for fallin in love (love don't do it yo)
That's what I get for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
(Akon) But I just went against the grain

[Hook]

[Akon]
So thick, so raw
That oil all over her body stole my heart, I'm cold
The way she dropped down won't allow me to close my jaw, cause I'm
Already in love and I knew better from the start, oh no

[Akon]
I was wrong for fallin in love (love)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
Said I was wrong for fallin in love (love don't do it yo)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
But I just went against the grain

[Hook]- repeat 2xReal niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

It never left, I just had to chill
Me and fifty one hundred niggas that will still kill
Them snakes in the grass, tryna police niggas
Say I'm livin' too large, I'm obese nigga
Eight hundred million and I cashed out
You ain't got it by now, well then you assed out
I read the blueprint, and then I ran with it
Gave it to Boo, he went and built his brand with it

Real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

In position of power, so now they hear me
May not admit it, but I know these niggas fear me
Every year I grind harder than the last one
Life's short, you never know when it's your last one
Black as fuck, my girl Yellow calls us her dealers
Keep it a hundred when niggas in high can kill us
You wanna hustle, just know I supply the dealer
How you live in the jungle and you ain't a gorilla, yeah

Real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'Verse 1
[Styles P]

I’m in the streets where the soldiers stay
You can talk about getting fresh with people where they close for days
You can roll in a nice whip, we be rolling haze
Maintained in the game, and I’m so amazed
Only Jews that we got was advice
From the brothers that been through it
But I can ask my mother she’s been through it
Back home in Africa where the struggle is real
I can say my blood line is spectacular
But it’s a sin and I don’t know my kin
I’m a ghost don’t know my beginning know my end
Yo Konvict calm my soul pray that I live
& I hope the lord forgive me for all of my sins

Chorus
[Akon]

Saw my life I could fight like a solider
Hustling was another mode a
That I can use to survive
Even though they said it ain’t right
So tell me where were you when those nights got colder
The day I thought that it was all over
As you can see I survived
Made the best of my life...

Verse 2
[Styles P]

I’m a man so I shed tears
For my homies in the jail and my dead peers
Lot of blood dropped the police the red years
Don’t show, cold sores, so the feds here
A lot of gangsters in my town like the Greb there
Outside all night cause it’s red there
Want to beef, forget invest, get headgear
This is the town where you get down
And drown nobody tread here
I swear to god that I’m telling the truth
Was a felon when I fell in the booth
They want me to feel
Like I was feeling I was scared of the truth
Yo Kon turn me up so I can give them the proof

Chorus

Verse 3
[Styles P]

I said I’m man enough to cry
I ought to let you know that I ‘m man enough to die
War for the cause when I do
21 salute, can into the sky
Have it for the drought when the grams gon’ get high
My friends are saying your man gon’ get high
Slide in the five just to gon’ get a buy
Sixth gear, 200 trying to die on the ride
Now I can outlaw, still arise, trunk full of pies

Chorus 2x[Intro - Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo, somebody tell Steven Spielberg and George Lucas thank you for directing this movie!

[Ron Browz]
Hashi Miki Hallah! Means "It's The Remix!"

[Hook - Busta Rhymes]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine

[Ron Browz]
Oh! We getting Arrab money! We getting Arab money!

[Verse 1 - Busta Rhymes]
Look, you can talk about your money but I really don't care
I'm into copping strange shit, now I'm trying to buy air! (gasps)
As the first black nigga that's a rap trillionaire
I control heat, I'm about to buy the ozone layer!
I'm into copping minerals now: diamonds and granite
So much paper I could probably gift wrap a planet
And clone a million Janets
Respect my accomplishments
As Salam Alaykoum Wa Rahmatoullah Wa Barakatouh !!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Diddy]
Hamdoullilah with my billions pilin'
I'm just wyling, bought 2 islands
Lakshmi Mittal-in', diamonds is salmon
Bout to buy 5th Ave, bitch I'm just stylin'
Money insane; while Jay was popping bottles
I was buying out planes just to fly around Spain
Fuck a recession, I'm still invested
Bout to buy Dubai and swim in the shark section
Fuck it, the dark section
Bitch, that's the Barack section

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Ron Browz]
You might catch me in a coup that cost 100 thous
"Haka la Sheika" means "I love you, Ron Browz!"
My money make noise, yours quiet as a mouse
Send an e-mail: Ether Boy's in the house
All the girls love me, yeah I pop bubbly
"Haka hashahi" means "shorty, dumb, ugly"
Find me on the dance floor doing the duggy
Trucks sit high, dude, next to your buggy

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Swizz Beatz]
Don't call me Swizz no more
Call me Kasim Daoud Shams ul-Din
When I come through, hit you with that brand new
Bugatti Coupe; damn thing only-only seats 2
But you know who (who?) Goon who be riding in my passenger
Side, we be flying shit, 2.5 in it
Hey, h-hey-hey-HEY - I'm in my Jeezy watching TV
She call me "Ha-habibi" while she feeding me linguine
Left right, l-left right - that Arab dance popping right
Swizz Beatz, Busta Bus, the money-money buss pipes

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - T-Pain]
I let my chain hang down with the rest of them
Teddy Pain rain down on the rest of them
Mr. Stripper Man that be hollering "get em man!" I'm at em, man
Rubberband; dropping money bombs like a Taliban
Oh la la, we getting Arab money
You want this hook, you gonna pay that money
Save that money, give it to my kids
I'll take that honey, give her all my kids like -

[Hook]

[Verse 6 - Akon]
I got that Arab money
4-star Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Straight cash when I come in
Lemme exchange the currency cause it's all foreign
I got that A-RAB MONEY!
Waking up to 5 concubines in the morning
Diamond mines still runnin'
On all of Africa, you can ask Tarzan

[Hook]

[Verse 7 - Lil' Wayne]
Calendar say I get money everyday
Smile look like iced-out Perrier
Bury me a G and tell her kids that I was
Now jump into your grave if you dig what I dug
Cash Money Universal multi-check
20 chains look like a scarf on my neck
Young Money Entertainment: girls and fame

I'm back in your zone, baby, back in your vibe
Now I can't be denied, I can't lie, I'm on ya
And never, ever wanna say "Sayonara"
Somebody told me that the grass was greener
On the other side, andele, ariba
Never really intended on being a cheater
What I gotta do to be your keeper?
These words comin' out the speaker
Trill love is off the meter

[Hook]

[Baby Bash] + (Akon)
I was gone for a minute, but now I'm home
Please forgive me for being a Rolling Stone
Please forgive me, let me polish it up, like chrome
Get off the phone, tell 'em squares to leave you alone
Let me spark your interest
Now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know how I get it wet
How I keep it softly and I get respect
You don't have to look no further (No)
You dealin' with the whole enchilada (Yeah)
You don't have to look no further (No)

Put on a fresh white suit and the Mini Coop' sittin on dubs
I'm just lookin for somebody to talk to and show me some love
If you know what I mean... uh-huh
E'rybody jockin as soon as I stepped in the spot
Two hundred bitches and I'm bettin ain't none of them hot
Ecept for this pretty young thing that was workin all the way at the top
Shawty what is your name?
Oh she made us drinks, to drink; we drunk 'em, got drunk
And then I think, she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We hit it off somethin proper like

[T-Pain]
Got a brand new girl so I'm feelin all good inside
Feel like I put some brand new 24's on a brand new ride
Triple shot of Patron on the rocks with a lil' bit of lime

E'ry time I hit the spot babygirl taking care of me

She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We gon' have fun at my spot tonight

[Hook]

[Akon]
Shorty I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out
Unless I'm in the M6 doin tricks freeway burnt out
Got a passenger side that's empty wantin it to be yo' spot
Put you on my Billboard we can act like the charts I can end up on top
Don't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby
Just lookin at you from a distance, lookin like a God damn star baby
So my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car?
'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorr'

[T-Pain]
Oh she made us drinks, to drink; we drunk 'em, got drunk

[Akon]
You're so beautiful[Verse: Jeezy]
Had a mill at 16 know how that felt?
And I'm still kicking shit, bitch black belt
Shoulda seen me in that yella 4-30
Got it washed everyday, bitch never seen dirty
Told me meet him at the waffle house, he got a clean .30
On my Domino's shit, only took a mean 30
My folks always on time yeah I’m talking C Murder
Is it me or this Franck Muller or it just seem early
I’m in something low-key, steady mobbing with the thang
Pretty soft way, steady mobbin be the gang
Cut the music down cause my cellphone ringing
From what I just heard think my cellphone dreaming
Wasn't doing this I'd probably be a politician
Fuck first forty-eight just too much snitching
If them folks get behind me it be a whole lot of chasing
Cause I ain't pulling over be a whole lotta arresting
What?

[Hook: Akon]
Ain't a damn thing change now
Cause I been getting money
Who you know pulled up
Black cars jeweled up with the big-faced hundreds
Put them things on the road now
Nigga still getting that dough now
Niggas think I lucked up, must got me fucked up
Cause I been getting money

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
And just when I thought it couldn't get no better
Nigga hit me on my chirp, got all my cheddar
All wondering why I got this shit runnin like a shower
Big bag full of white, you woulda thought it was some flour
Going hard in the kitchen like a culinary school
I be doin my thang, I'm a culinary fool
So much PJ, I was pissin that shit
Talkin bottles so big put a fist in that shit
You were born that way, always be a hater
Don Jaun on these hoes, always be a playa
Way I work through the check I shoulda been a calculator
I'm so cold with this shit, count it in the refrigerator
Jewelry store, green bob bought my first Cartier
Threw em 30 thou and got the fuck up outta there
That's how JoJo and Timbo one day got indicted
If it's a party with the feds, I ain't tryna get invited

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Imagine this breeze coming from the ceiling fast
Stack a hundred bills in your right hand
Right there by the couch bag of rubber bands
Gotta get 5, double stacked that's a hundred grand
Rose gold jacob, 4 units for the timepiece
Got my niggas working so much they need a time sheet
They thought it was a joke until I copped that 6
7:45 pull up in that bitch
Ever see a nigga pop a hundred bottles for the club
Wanna be a trap man, get the money, get ya love
One song, blew a quarter chicken, yeah that's a condo
If a nigga re'ing up with half a ticket that's a car quote

[Hook]Hey ladies, drop it down

...I know they wanna come and separate us
But they can't do us nothin'
You're the one I want and I'ma continue lovin'
Cause you're considered wifey and I'm considered husband
And I'ma always be there for you

And either way you look at it, I ain't goin' nowhere for my muffin'
Cause she gonna hold it down, can't nobody tell her nothin'
That got the kind of love that always make a better fussin'
And that's what gets me closer to you

And no one knows why I'm into you
Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

Seems like every day that go by, things are gettin' harder
Wanna be the one that give you the whole enchilada
Cause I know what my baby like, I lean you on that Prada
You ain't got to match with the shoes

All about knowin' you, I'm into doin' things to keep her longer
Stickin' together forever, watch you grow stronger
That's the way it has to be, everythin' proper
Keepin' it always true

And no one knows why I'm into you
Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

You are everythin' in my life, see the joy you bring
And ain't no one I compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what
And that's why I plan to do the same thing for you
And I want you to know

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you[Hook: Akon]
I wanna be bigger, bigger than the fame
Bigger than the lights, bigger than the money
Out on the stage
I wanna be bigger, bigger than it all
Bigger than the glory, so I could never fall
Bigger than the sky, bigger than the clouds
We never coming down

[Verse 1: Steven Cooper]
I'm a, bit bigger like david taking goliath
Just trying to get my voice steady screaming out through the silence
This industry makes me resort to violence
Cause I've been kicked around too long, stuck these vice grips
Plus, when nobody supports you, they pirate
So there's no money left to make the next of my hits
Other rappers ignoring me, now on my list
Cause I've been keeping track of the dust left on my kicks
Ugh, and ya'll are bound to see
I'm out to be much bigger than all those surrounding me
While you're dreaming of stars, I reach for galaxies
If you're doubting me, keep on, I'm bound to be

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Steven Cooper]
So big, these haters here must stop
Cause you talk a big game, but I learn to trust not
Been doing it long enough and I've had enough stops
So I'll do it 'till I make it or until my lungs pop
Here so watch out, until I grow old and I'm a wash out
I'm a be the biggest thing shining, so pull your watch out
Forget a platinum record, I'm bigger than first or second
I'm larger than premadonna's, all you snakes and anaconda's
Not finished with my sentence, no period, put a comma
This thing is running on, my message just getting longer
There's a sauna burning up, with this world against me
I'm a be the biggest thing that you ever did seeYeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I made the mark on February 1st
Between me and you, you can call it birth
The beginning of our universe
Remind me of Alicia Keys verse

I'm falling for you
I wish I had an opportunity to not do
What I did to hurt you
And now I'm here living with regrets

I know that it was my fault
I know that I got caught
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me

I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart

Get the calendar, go to August 3rd
1st words stay, we heard our 1st words
First argument gotta let it go
Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds

Flipping pages now famous
Thinking back I ain't seen you in ages
Wishing that I coulda made it less painless
Brings me back right back to the same as

I know that it was my fault
I know that I got caught
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me

I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart

January, February, March, April, May
June, July, August is just another day
September, October, November trying to find a way
In December to mark my calendar to meet again

If only we can go to that place where me and you know
There's no faith fronting cheating even lying
The time has come where we stand face to face

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart

That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart
That stamp right next to your heart[Intro: Akon] + (Styles P)
Geah (crazy)
It's one of the things man you gotta experience
To know what I'm talkin about (ha ha)
It's where the going gets rough (Akon)
The tough stay tough (Styles P)
Ah-HAH! Upfront, let's go!
Konvict, Konvict, ha ha
We in too deep to turn back now D (sure is)
Watch yourself, 'fore you get (watch) blown away

[Styles P]
You know where I come from
The place where your fade is a mic or a bull or dum-dum
A jail cell, a pine box and brothers are dumb young
Still bust a gun for the slum that they come from
Cops is the only ones they gon' run from
They puttin they hood up
But nine out of ten of us ain't got good luck
You gon' ride on a man and catch 25 (blown away)
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
So me, I play the hood baby, nine in the groin
Momma got a little church I could join but I ain't go yet
Man got a mosque I could join but I ain't go yet
Cool with the devil on my back, I'm in cold sweats
About to do some dirt, in some dirty black old sweats
If you known you should've shown the way (blown away)
Most the hood, on the path to get blown away

[Hook: Akon]
Cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here
If you ain't man up to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
Cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryin to hold on a couple mo' years
Tryin not to get blown away

[Akon]
See I ain't never shot nobody, but I'm known for fightin
So when I strike man you think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin a nigga
Even a child can take a life by pullin a trigger
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
See your target in the distance and keep on blastin
They say, "Guns don't kill people, people do"
So when you hit man you feel that shit them evils do
Can't see myself gettin beat down, my eyes swollen
Moms cryin, really don't know what happened, my pride's stolen
If I ain't got my heat (uh-huh) then I got a blade (uh-huh)
That can get you off me in so many ways

[Hook]

[Akon]
I keep my eye out for Jakes, ears to the streets
Other eye out for snakes, and these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms don't bother to speak
Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me
Same thing make you laugh, will make you cry
Fuck around and let this quiet nigga here take your life
Hate for it to be you the world's sacrifice
So somebody else could travel through the tunnel of life
Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there when you're ridin
But I stay to myself
So if you see me out there with a bear and we fightin
Nigga then go help the bear

[Hook][Intro] [Kardinal talking]
Hey yo 'kon. We keep givin it to them every day my nig
We got another one? Here we go

[Verse One]
Ahhh shit here we go again
I'm lookin' at you but I'm seein' your friend
Both my hands fit around her waist
Her astronauts takin' up my space yo
I'm about to launch my rocket
Take off!
Your clothes and reach in my pocket
Grab the controller, similar to Wii
It's a game and I'mma let you beat me

[Akon]
Shawty's body's like an hourglass, that's no lie
You know if she bring it to me
The cash bout to fly, man
I'm so ready for her, I wanna throw it so fast
But I just wait to show her the blast

[Hook] [Akon]
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

[Verse Two] [Kardinal]
Bounce, twerk
Show me a little work
I'mma take them calories off with that shirt
Look how you bouncin'
All of the sudden I think how many men try to climb that mountain
Them heels you got is no joke
Even Akon might go broke
Spendin' them ones, throwin' them twenties
I'm in love in the back throwin' up centuries
That's the body of the century
You a little insecure but baby you got plenty
Them stretch marks on your hips
Is just bungee cords bringin' you back when you dip
I read your lips, my game stay literate
I ain't scared, not a little bit
Gotta let you know
You're worth about a million ounce
Now just bounce

[Hook] [Akon]
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

[Verse Three]
Chyeaa, T.O.!
PS3, the PS stands for Pssst
If ya body bouncin' around me
Then it's game over, act like you older
Either we bouncin' right now or your dirt off the shoulder
So extra
Mr. Material
Let me feel on your birthday suit texture so resilient
I like how on the inside its like a wetsuit brilliant
Water resistant up to 9 inches
Wrap that, let me open it up like Christmas
I'm about the same height as Sidris
Keep on your heels, let's get down to business
No gym but I'm seein' your fitness
With my eyes closed you pose as a witness
Every word the body language you pronounce

[Hook] [Akon]
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce

I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

[Akon]
Just show me how you do it baby
Just let me see
Thinkin' how you dippin' so amazing in front of me
Really into lookin' hot
Always at the body shop
Workin' on that beautiful figure

[Hook] [Akon]
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it[Hook: Akon] + (Ashanti)
The way that you're walkin, the way that you're talkin - talkin
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them drawers and bang it out 'til the mornin - the mornin
(Ahhhhhhh) I can already tell you want it
Cause you're shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin that (body on me)
Keep on shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin that (body on me)

[Nelly]
I'm lovin that! Uh, uh
Hey how you doin mama? I need to know your name
You givin me the eye eye, I'm givin you the same
It just hit me right now, what we should do today
Go tell your friends bye-bye, and let's go hop a plane
It's no mistaken, the attraction's ironic
I wanna make you someone more than just a bone in my closet
I wanna win that, type of relationship
Where you gon' wanna come hang when your man done tripped
You say you short this month, and you're late on your rent
He took your car, what you mean? Hold this
Yea-yayyy, sing, whoahhhh
You see, lil' mama outta control, and I'm just sayin

[Hook]

[Nelly]
I'm lovin that!
Shorty movin closer, and closer
And slower, and lower, yeah
I think she know she makin me hard
Got every man in the buildin like, "Oh my God"
She, slicker than lodi-dodi, she work her body body
When you done hurr at the party, meet me down there in the lobby
And I'll be waitin on ya, ain't no debatin on ya
I got a seat for ya, we can let the top back and goooooo
We don't have to stop girl, noooooo

Believe me, you're strong
Lil' mama please don't make me wait too long (yea-yayyy)

[Hook]

[Ashanti]
Now I see you're lookin at my body babe
And now you wanna come and put it on me
If I gave it to you could you promise me
That you could make it feel like it never did
Cause I see you (I see you) and you see me (you see me)
Now if I please you (I please you) could you please me (you please me)
Now I ain't the one in no relationship
And I ain't tryna be the other chick
I know you want it

[Hook]3, 2, 1

[Hook 1: Akon]
Now put your hands in the air, shake your body down slow
Go on and bring it, bring it back like you never did it before
Keep your hands in the air while you drop it down low
Let me see you work it out like a stripper on a pole

[Intro: DJ Felli Fel]
Okay..
If you came to party tonight I need y'all to get y'all drinks in the air
Get your Cîroc bottles in the air
And if you see a sexy lady right now;
Put your-put your hands up!

[Hook 2: Akon]
Your body lookin' amazing when you're dancing like that
Girl, get up on the stage and go ahead and do your thang
Sexy beautiful lady, won't you bring it right back?
Go head and pull a 180, you're my boomerang

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Mommy got a boom bang, bing bang, ding dang
No digga dee, no doubt, I’mma hit that
That thing so fat, looks like she got a
Oompa loompa in her pants, now give me that
I don’t beat around the bush like King K
But I discipline ya, call me sensei
I don’t care what them say
Cause that little chick on Mr. Worldwide – Pen pay
From M.I.A. to L.A. to P.A., leavin' bread like CJ
CJ meeting Pam in the scene on Baywatch
I stay high, what she talk about?
I don't pimp in the parking lot
I got your girl in the bathroom acking a monkey
While I play with her bam boom
Then I throw her back like a boomerang, you buffoon

[Hook 2]

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Felli! I see ya
You know I had to get on this!
Let's go!

That uh-, Rose I pour it, shawty
I'm where she throw it
It's a sight to see her shake her ass (Drop it low)
Fresh to death, I'm polo and we are
In the middle of the floor


Don't dance no more

In ATL
AGM, you know it-know it


And all these shawties

I'm like, "Nigga, you trippin'"
You better act like you know
You better grab you somethin', take your ass to the floor
Cause it's clear, I'm here and I ain't leaving up this bitch 'till it's time to go
