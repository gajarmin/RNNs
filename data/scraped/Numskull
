[Intro]
Man I'm outa cream
Get your ice cream, ice cream
Not Ice-T not Ice Cube, ice cream
Thangs have thangs
Q P's, zippers what ever you need
Hard, soft get your ice cream
Ice cream
Ice cream

[Verse 1 : Numskull]
Well its the ice cream bitch don't you hear the music
I got the shit fiends want, holla at me when they use it
I got shit sold, I pimp those broke ass nymphoes
Got them sukin dick in pintos
I guarantee its not a soda rock
You can bring cash money
Food stamps, or we can swap stolen goods
For a fat ass dum dum
I sweep the things from they feet with a broom
I rush to the spot where schools of the dope fiends have seen
And they pass other fools up
Nigga jealous cause I got good crack cola
While their shit is packed with baking soda
I'm on the bandwagon why not
Niggas sayin they got the same shit I got
Its because I'm takin the money
Cause I got my shit from bounty
With a little bit of cut in it
All you got is a couple of bucks
Go head and spend it
It's all good
But money ain't all good
Cause a raw deal will get your ass at the Vacaville
My niggas don't have any bucks wit em
Cause of that I don't fuck wit em
I don't fuck with them homies
Cause some of them don't know me
When they tell me what the deally
For a sack of buddha
A got that motherfuckin thing
Niggas jump to they feet
When they hear the music in the street
Get your can get your can can get your can
Rush to the van so you can catch the ice cream man
Bitch don't you hear the music

[Verse 2: Dru Down]
Well it's the Coca Cola man bitch
Can't beat the feelin
Or the real thing yeah you know I got green
So come on a huddle
Give me ten or twenty dollarz
So I can give you rocks or do you want powder
What ever you get I bet you it's the shit
Niggas you know I ripped this shit
Up to the fullest
It keeps the dope fiends comin and comin
Now they runnin
Up to a niggas spot
Its making me hot
I'm about to go sit
I'm goin crazy wit this shit
I'm grindin
I'm slanging through the night
I'm watching tweakers tweak
Because they need a P-I-P-E
Ugh, I look out my window with my motherfuckig Glock
God damn damn I see holes in my van
Checkin them niggas on a corner
You ponk ass niggas
That's why I'm in the house with tha Cola
And some cash stacked to the top
I got more money fool that will make me plock plock
No hesitation and no fear
My observation is to make a milli year
Yeah, and them some daddy will let me his daughter
I'm bothered by this square nigga
Well I'm a work a 25 and you can keep that
Hand me a half sack so I can fill that
Nigga I'm a ride long and super fat jack
Cause I'm a dope dealer motherfuckin cream seller
People ask who I am
Tell them tha Cola Man

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
I need to chop up some cream
Cause the sunshine is bright as fuck
Knocks blowin up my shit
Cause they missed the ice cream truck
Cut up a half and rushed the post
UUU shit, but they don't sweat me cause I look like a school kid
But still I'm watching my back
Cause they will gaffle, pressin my lucks
Slangin right by the hill castle
I got that cream and niggas get jealous
But I don't play that
I got my gap hittin it in the cut
My bundle hittin of quick
Shit, I got glamour
Takin the Glock from niggas with arm and hammer
Come hear take this Glock
I'm sure the nigga will love it
Bring my money up
I'm on alert when I work
But they forever try to get me
Cause I got my kids posted up wit me
That's what I got, I run in the spot, because I advertise
Plus I got the humongous rocks, soda for blocks
Nigga I got more locks then Goldilocks
It's time to make my rounds black
The cops are getting hopeful
I sense they jacked so I get mobile
I got two pop cicles and a cookie left
Shucks, I got myself nine bucks
Cause I give no credit, and I mean that
You won't see that nigga until next month
And when he come to spend
For himself, but he be claming that he comin for somebody else
I had to let him underdstand
It's soooo haaaard tooo saayyy gooood byyyee to the ice cream man(Numskull, Money B & Clee)
Is this my party or yours, my time or yours
My drank or yours, my place or yours
Can you drive? Naw, I'll drive
I don't lie, you lie
I even tell the truth when I lie
Now gimme some head, cause its the last time
You'll ever see a nigga like me

You heard 2Pac tape, and now you thuggin wit three
Bankrupt, hoodrats, and now they lovin some me

(Money B)
Say bitch do me a favor
Go get your boy a bat, and two shots of yay (alright)
I'm thinkin you my flava, I'm bout to put you on my hip

Well lets skate like Armor Yaga
They say the best pussy is new pussy

(Clee)
Now look at this bitch, she bout a eight or a nine
But a eight next to Clee, gon make her a dime
I just met the bitch, and she want me to make her mine
But I'm like bitch, grab a ticket, get a number, wait in line
And haters find me to be they worst nightmare
Cause I have they bitch cleanin house in they nightware
They be like, where in the fuck is my bitch at?
She proably blowin me back, while she blowin ya scratch

(Chorus)
Put Cha thang on me
I'm tryna drink, fuck, nut and get up

(Money B)

Make em take they knee like a touchback
And grab a hold to my nutsack, and lemme bust that

(Numskull)
I'm proably the dopest nigga that the earth ever made
I'm fine, I'm long, got game, and I'm paid
Nigga I can pull a bitch in a mail man suit
Leavin checks to checks, scopin in my steel toe boots

Payroll on mine, I ain't turnin down shit

(Chorus)Chorus *(Phats Bossalini & Val Young)* 2x

A thug changes, and love changes
That's the Ballers Feud
And best friends become strangers

Verse 1*(Yukmouth)*

Survey says...
You know some fake mutha fuckas
I know some bustas too
This fake mutha fucka been causin rukus in my crew
Since '92
At first I thought he was cool like Dru
Always hollerin the Dangerous Crew, but if you only knew
Them niggas don't wanna hang wit you
Cuz of the thangs you do
Learn a thang or two
Talkin bad bout yo homies, two bitches who juss be framin you
Niggas thinkin bout hangin you, the game is true
Everywhere we go the punk hoo bangin you
Makes it kinda hard for me to swang wit you
That's why niggas only hang wit Dru, my pimpydoo
Folk-el, smoke out my Range Rove-el
What? What?
Fuck these broke-els
I hate it when niggas be playin wit yo mail, because they only end up
Smoked out
Broke as hell
Drivin buckets
I'm drivin luxury cars and plus shit
Benz the Lexus the roughest to fuck wit
So you wanna be P-I-M-P?
You need to get a bitch to fuck you fo free
You payin G's fo pussy

*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 2 *(Numskull)*

There's too many playas
Too many ballas
Too many hustlas
Too many killas
Too many pimped out mutha fuckas
So now we got the east coast and the west coast feudin to see who's
Cleanest
The cleanest mutha fucka is the richest and the genius
What if you stumbles, like buyin too many houses
Wit rims to put on yo shit, too many furry couches
Who the mouses nigga, I think you knowin
Sheadin tears from bitches who take yo shit and keep goin
An don't come back, cuz they done sucked you dick and yo cabbage
Got 20 hoes across America livin lavish
Hatin is juss a ho thang, yo, I gotta live like that
A bitch can roll wit me, or hit the track
You can talk about pimpin, you can talk about killin
But when that shit goes down, sound minds will be revealin
When you die and comeback, maybe you can try again and beat me
But don't try now, cuz you niggas can't see me
22, ready to hoo ride at moments notice
First to swang, hittin noses, eyes can't focus
Hocus pocus
Now 25 niggas on ya
Juss because you moved from California
Ballers Feud

*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 3 *(Kastro)*

We went from loved ones, on the way up
To no love at all
Time to go though, so I don't give no fucks at all
Cross the game
Don't be playin, stoned get right
I shed blood wit this, and that can't be gone, overnight
This hate
Man, could be a cold mutha fucka
Close friends, close as cat scan, love 'em like my brother
Now I
See 'em dyin like a mutha fucka
Slow death, no breath
Man I love it like my mother
And that's some cold shit, I'm on some mo' swole shit
Listen quick
Fingers thick
Lady clit
Piss this shit, on yo clit
Niggas know I'm flossin K-Cash
Cash foldin
You want what I'm holdin, my wife an my life stolen
Worse enemy, authority
Police are all enemy
Richeously, this life fo' me ain't as bad as it seems to be
But still in all I love, all I love
Take my ten fingers, my ten toes, an mash outta love
Do it fo ya'll, all ya'll
My baby girl an God
This crazy world like a knife in the heart of my cause
Now half part of me hard
The other part of me scarred
Death wit out health, but still a nigga prayin to God

*(Chorus)* 4x[Numskull]
This right here's just my opinion
You get mad? Fuck it

Aight, this is what I think: I'm saying fuck rhymin'
I think Mexicans should only own MacDonalds
I think I'm right by saying fuck racist ass Reno
I think Indians should only own casinos
I think you should put a ban on all Country music
Fuck ..., ... fuck you bitch
I think Al Sharpton should sell me some keys
I think Monica Lewinsky should stay on her knees
I think homeless people should be shot in the streets
Nigga it's your fucking fault you ain't got nothing to eat
I think all police was picked on in school
That's why they fuck with niggas now cause they finally in a crew
We should've diked George Bush for all the dope he sold
I think he the president now, that white boy cold
But he gotta be stopped now, strip the best residence
I think we should make Humpty Hump the president

[Shock G]
I think I'm crazy for letting you talk that shit on my album
We got bigger problems and shooting the homeless ain't gon' solve them
Carter, ..., what the fuck they'd do to you?
I thought you were a musician nigga, they party yo crew
I think you should own the MacDonalds, shit, we ain't been going platinum
And that statement about Bush, aight, you right about that one
I think George Clinton should be president, or at least George Carlin
I'm glad the Catholic church is finally fallin'
Faggot ass racist child molesters ain't shit shot
I'll shoot the deal if you tryna grind on my block
But I'd rather give a job
I ain't no hog, I follow God
And Mother Nature that's the way it is
We gotta teach these kidsMe and You

[Daz] And you know that

Me and You

[Daz]
Who can fade it, two assassins up on the mic
Blastin', askin' no questions, when they catch you in a gunfight
Kaboom! We still mash as a team
As we mash for our dreams, jackin hood niggas for green
It's Dillinger, fulfillin, makin a low outta killin
Pullin' scandalous schemes fulfillin fantasy dreams
Catch me on a Costa Rica, with an island full of weed
Money and bitches, on a boat for Sweden

[Numskull]
See when I'm yellin'
International help me
No colorlines on my
Ugly and fine
You can sell me
I'm glad folks think the same way as I do
Cause I stab bitches way down in the Bayou
Would you make way for two mo'
Fo' blows, like you have hoes
Stamp a nation wide through the ghetto
Fore youngsters, Hennesy sponsors
With fore youngsters on a
Quarter of the map now I do

[Daz]
I spin mayor loot and khaki suits
Nike's and cripsacks
Wetsuits and leather boots
I block niggas twice with thighs
Buck with a .45
Make you open while you blast at the parking lot

[Numskull]
What you speakin' on
Wanna go through it
Drink a lot, made from fluid
Scrump bitch, don't you hear the music
My buddy, Daz Dilly and Numskull
You will be thanked
With you're petty pang petty

Chorus: repeat 2X

To all my niggas.. and all my bitches
Throw your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck
Like we don't give a fuck then
Throw your motherfuckin hood up in the air

[Kurupt]
Check it out
No bitch ass niggas, no funny ass hoes
Dogg Pound Gangstas drippin' in low-lows
You ain't all about the homies
You besta check the fault
Pencils, playin niggas in the crowd style
Thinkin bout the row outta town
With the heater cock bust a million rounds
Dogg Pound international's breakin off fools
While the dock can bust
The facility touch

[Yukmouth]
I laid this game down
Jumped around and kissed myself like I was James Brown
Spin around and hit the splits on the ground
Split your motherfuckin crown
Turn this ifs into pounds
Dogg Pound live around
Niggas hittin' the ground
Fuck around and get shot up
I tear shit up
You can ask Puff
Lil Cease, Mary J. B. and Jodeci
About that nigga Yuk
Means the hardcore
Got kicked off tour
For piss marking on the hotel floor

[Kurupt]
G riders, We ride, DP ride
Get the mashin niggas
Or the mat see automatic
Get the blastin niggas
Shakin nigga, bankin nigga
Quit the heater
Stop blankin niggas

[Yukmouth]
I'm danked out
Surrounded by weed smoke
You See me and my niggas in the club
Thugged up, suited in steet clothes
We roll, cut dough
Cause weed so
On triple gold, see hoes
With weed with me and my amigo

Chorus 2X

[Knumbskull]
Who did that, who shitted
Who spoke on the ghetto values
Who supa-dupu flyyyyy
I catored to the pimps, players, hustlers and bastards

[Kurupt]
Why don't you meet me over in the O, Homie
Cause when I get there
The hoes will be all off on me
I know y'all got a gang of bitches...

[Daz]
...Ha, ha
And like fabulous thangs and livin' life expensive
In nights machine dippin'
With a pocket full of c-notes
Cruise the block with a 9 lookin' for weed-o
And oh yeah, who got the gangsta shit
Daz and Kurupt, Numskull, Yuk for shit bitch

[Yukmouth]
Known as your playa potna
Slain ice cream fools and (?)
Rockin Hilfiger just like kadada
I walk around the house of rockwilder
Just like a mobster
The O-A-K bust and throw it away
Hoop out the roof down in LA
And then go aloof
Opps! and make a nigga spooked
With a couple of screws loose
And find your homie
Sweatin, buck naked locked up in a chicken coop
Why?
Livin that destory all arts
Zark, and blast a homes
Pull back and grab your mothafuckin heart out your chest
If you tested the best like David Koresh
Get ready to be
Reincarnated in the motherfuckin flesh
Yes yes

Zark, and blast a homes
Pull back and grab your mothafuckin heart out your chest
If you tested the best like David Koresh
Get ready to be
Reincarnated in the motherfuckin flesh
Yes yes

Chorus 2X[Numskull]
This right here's just my opinion
You get mad? Fuck it

Aight, this is what I think: I'm saying fuck rhymin'
I think Mexicans should only own MacDonalds
I think I'm right by saying fuck racist ass Reno
I think Indians should only own casinos
I think you should put a ban on all Country music
Fuck ..., ... fuck you bitch
I think Al Sharpton should sell me some keys
I think Monica Lewinsky should stay on her knees
I think homeless people should be shot in the streets
Nigga it's your fucking fault you ain't got nothing to eat
I think all police was picked on in school
That's why they fuck with niggas now cause they finally in a crew
We should've diked George Bush for all the dope he sold
I think he the president now, that white boy cold
But he gotta be stopped now, strip the best residence
I think we should make Humpty Hump the president

[Shock G]
I think I'm crazy for letting you talk that shit on my album
We got bigger problems and shooting the homeless ain't gon' solve them
Carter, ..., what the fuck they'd do to you?
I thought you were a musician nigga, they party yo crew
I think you should own the MacDonalds, shit, we ain't been going platinum
And that statement about Bush, aight, you right about that one
I think George Clinton should be president, or at least George Carlin
I'm glad the Catholic church is finally fallin'
Faggot ass racist child molesters ain't shit shot
I'll shoot the deal if you tryna grind on my block
But I'd rather give a job
I ain't no hog, I follow God
And Mother Nature that's the way it is
We gotta teach these kids(Numskull, Money B & Clee)
Is this my party or yours, my time or yours
My drank or yours, my place or yours
Can you drive? Naw, I'll drive
I don't lie, you lie
I even tell the truth when I lie
Now gimme some head, cause its the last time
You'll ever see a nigga like me
I'm on some fuckin and flee
You only hate cause you lovin to eat
You heard 2Pac tape, and now you thuggin wit three
Bankrupt, hoodrats, and now they lovin some me

(Money B)
Say bitch do me a favor
Go get your boy a bat, and two shots of yay (alright)
I'm thinkin you my flava, I'm bout to put you on my hip
Let you vibrate my shit like a pager
That ass is lookin major
Do you fuck on the first date?
Well lets skate like Armor Yaga
They say the best pussy is new pussy
You even true pussy
I turned you into crew pussy

(Clee)
Now look at this bitch, she bout a eight or a nine
But a eight next to Clee, gon make her a dime
I just met the bitch, and she want me to make her mine
But I'm like bitch, grab a ticket, get a number, wait in line
And haters find me to be they worst nightmare
Cause I have they bitch cleanin house in they nightware
They be like, where in the fuck is my bitch at?
She proably blowin me back, while she blowin ya scratch

(Chorus)
Put Cha thang on me
I'm tryna drink, fuck, nut and get up
You got your name on me
I see you lookin right, but what yo cash lookin like
Put cha thang on me
You say you wanna make it hot, well lets shake the spot
You got your name on me
Bitch we ain't trippin on ya
We from Oakland, California!

(Money B)
I'm drinkin hard liqour, the results come quicker
I got scratch bitch wikka wikka
I'm sick of you bousy hoes
I be fuckin wit them hoodrats and ????(make a bitch bust a nudey pose)
Fuck that, you got the plush cat, whats that?
Bend over, and lemme touch that(whats that?)
A freckled face nutstasche
Make em take they knee like a touchback
And grab a hold to my nutsack, and lemme bust that

(Numskull)
I'm proably the dopest nigga that the earth ever made
I'm fine, I'm long, got game, and I'm paid
Nigga I can pull a bitch in a mail man suit
Leavin checks to checks, scopin in my steel toe boots
Now, watch what I tell ya, i'ma pull Lil Kim
Cause she done got some shit fixed
Now she holdin her ten
From here, its fair game, fuckin everybodys bitch
Payroll on mine, I ain't turnin down shit

(Clee)
Well heres a little somethin about a nigga like Clee
Nigga been a playa since elementary
And I'ma stay a playa till the next century
Got the ???sayin, wow bitch its Clee
Let a bitch hit to me, I'm the one she wanna leave wit
I'ma have that bitch, playboy, please believe it
We run game on em, then we run trains on em
Its even to the point when they put our names on em

(Chorus)Num Skull

The End is near!
