Yeah.. ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier..

[2Pac]
The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob figures love to act up
The first to bomb when we rob niggas
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessey
Talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin' "Fuck the police," as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin' wild, towards danger
What's the cause?
Don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin' nigga unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Hook: singing + 2Pac]
Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..
(close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
(close your eyes)

[2Pac]
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin' bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two Glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder - then hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Hook] *
* last line: "close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"

[2Pac]
Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facin' sixty years, sheddin' tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the tier
Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death nigga
Take a breath come be the last one left nigga, it's real now
Feel it or fantasize it, ain't nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier

[Hook] *
* last line: "close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"

[2Pac]
This go out to Kato, Mental
All the niggas that passed away
Mutulu, Geronimo.. Seyku .. all the down ass riders
All the niggas that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggas that go through that day to day struggled
This is the ballad of a dead soldier!
All the niggas that passed on
All the niggas with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggas that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, shit
Them niggas'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin' block, fuck the cops!
The police? We run these streets nigga
Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!
These niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair
But nigga, you know - it's the ballad of a dead soldier![Intro]
1999
The world's at its end
Fuck it
We want the money and the power
And go out with a bang

[Hook: Cold 187um]
Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my 9 put it on my chest bust some cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm coming from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' back
Can't fuck with Eazy
[w/ Kokane - several times]
Wet 'em up

[Verse 1]
This is a real life jack in progress
Nigga, give up your shit or take two to the chest with the cripness
Cause I ain't fuckin' around, G
So take a look at a real live nigga that's crazy
And get ready to die, loc
Any last words
Before your ass gets smoked, it ain't a joke
Because my pockets is broke my friend
That's why I gotta do you in
Give up your ends and your gold and your brand new Nike's
And anything else I might like
And then I'm off in the wind again
To catch the next sucker
Slippin' takin' two to the chin
I'm on a role two niggas in one night
Didn't even have to fight
Just pulled out my 9 to end anothers life
That's real life so forget the silly shit you heard
Now nigga tell me, do you have any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Another murder I committed made front page
A nigga dead from a drive-by, did him with a 12 gauge
The first stage of insanity
People say it ain't wise, to get faded of the St. Ides
A mother cries, another son lies in a casket
Life was fun while it lasted
That silly bastard had to get caught
Trippin' and set trippin'
You should have seen that niggas blood drippin'
To many lives took
To many hearts broke
But you don't hear me, you just see my fuckin' gun smoke
Some ask why do I take so many lives from
The innocent little ones
But where I come from
We take shit real
You peel caps so you get your fuckin' cap peeled
Grab your steel, forget about what you heard
It's do or die, nigga
Any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got the 9 and I'm pullin', straight creep
Feel I need to take anothers life, so I peep
Checkin' the scene but stayin' low
So I'm not seen, case I gotta get away
Gotta make the shit clean, G
So I'm lookin' for a victim
Gotta be right took my time and I picked him
Scoped shit, then I licked him
Now I'm back in the news no clues but yet another murder
You should have heard the nigga squill when I stuck his ass
I had to grin cause it's funny, nigga, fuck his ass
He ain't the last and surely ain't the first, G
But his monkey ass rolled away in a hearse, G
So I'm feelin' some what relieved
Just another day in the life of the Eazy
A real G, so forget the silly shit you heard
It's do or die, Eazy-E gets that last word

[Hook][Pac] Damn.. what I'mma do now? When I get free.. oh shit!
[Jay] Get free.. yeah yeah

[Hook: repeat 2X]
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'mma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

[2Pac]
Them bitches is foul, take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin quick as the wind, it's me or them
Fuck friends my foes be on a mission tryin to do me in
Fuck 'em I'm bout to get out, they all soft
I blow up to new range, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggas tryin to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Main thang with nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it I'll enforce it with the steel, use the lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Now I'm workin with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin again

[Hook] + J. Valentine's harmonizing

[2Pac]
Still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin me baby
To a young motherfucker facin eighty that's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get her hooked
Got her watchin me liftin weights, sneakin looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'mma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin it to Hell
All them niggas that was frontin while I sat up in the cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned your misery
The nigga you don't wanna see

[Hook] + J. Valentine's harmonizing

[2Pac]
Stuck in my cell
The pen ain't nuttin like the county jail
When will they let me bail?
Walkin through the yard, I play the Guard
First nigga disrespect me first nigga gettin scarred
I'm, back on the scene
I'm hittin knees in the back of a limousine, puffin on weed
As we game on the drunk hoes
Hit the skunk I reminisce just on the way
We used to play, you punk hoes
What I posess is to be rich, in currency
Paranoid niggas like bitches when they come and see me
Laid out, played out, the nigga barely breathin
As for that bullshit punk, nigga and now we even
But I wait, until it's time
And try to find a crooked way to profit off this crime
This life of mine.. until I get free
My prophecy is niggas screamin, as if they bleed in agony
As soon as they popped my gate
I knew these motherfuckers made a mistake

[Hook] + J. Valentine's harmonizing

[Hook] - 1/2

[2Pac]
When I get free
Hahaha.. yeah nigga, when I get motherfuckin free
Pop the gate, I'm back baby!
When I get free.. we up out this bitch[Intro]
"You heard about what's going on in here?"
"Heard a lotta bullshit cocked, I know that much."
"This isn't bullshit, my friend."
"Do you know something?"
"Don't listen."
"What do you know?"
"Maybe I do and maybe I don't. What I say is that they ain't got no business negotiating. We gonna be going back in they're with a bullet for everybody in the yard."
"Is that right?"
"We do it now, we do it later, later it can be new use. Am I right Al?"
"Well, wait, wait, wait minute Frank. We gotta a lotta angry guys in. They're black muslims, Panther's, Young Lord. Besides you average anti-social."
"So we gotta go in right, clean their clocks."

[Verse 1: KM.G]
I hit the loose juice and pulls up in the deuce
He gives me the scoop about the fake ass troops
And how niggas out there wanna play
I take another hit of the way and then I blast away
[Hutch:] "How far, playa?"
Far enough to go off the edge
I push another nigga off the ledge
So I stumble as I slide to the Chevy
Yeah, my eyes kinda teary and gun kinda heavy
I'm a walking dead man is what they call me when I'm comin'
Got the big S on my chest, so I'm kinda gunnin'
High powered on my way to the west side
To check upon on some chickens, it's a hell of a drive, so drive on
As I hit my dodo stick to the breaking dawn
Crime fighting's what I do and niggas in my crew
Don't take lightly to you bustas and so we say fuck you
Then buck you, tuck you in for the night
As you think about the paper at the funeral site
So when I'm hangin' with the clique, and we in demand
I feel good that the city of angels call me black superman

[Hook: 2x]
Now everybody sing
Black superman
Now everybody know
Black superman

[Interlude]
*phone rings*
[Hutch's answerphone:] "Yo this Hutch, I ain't in right now. But uh, leave a message at the beep. You know I'm out flossin' and tossin', dippin' and trippin'. You know what I'm sayin'?"
[KM.G:] "Aye Hutch man uh, they just leavin' yo mama's house, um, I don't know what they got but, um man, they lookin' for us, man. Call me over at Peach's house."
*hangs up phone*

[Verse 2: Hutch (aka Cold 187um)]
Now it was once said by a known loc G
Always tryna come up, yeah, and that's a G
Uh, cause when I bomb it's like a curse
Cause see, once in a lifetime everybody did some dirt
I guess it got to me the same
So at the age of 15, I entered the dope game
I had my game locked up tight
In the day I went to school, but I clocked all night
And when I went to class I always felt asleep
But I was out like a motherfucker, if somebody beeped
My teacher said, "Boy, can't it wait?"
I said, "No, I got to put some mo' icing on my cake."
I think I saved about 50 G's
I bought a truck, a house, and a Coupé on D's
Mom is trippin but she really don't know
All I'm thinkin' is she ain't on the county no mo'
Before my mama fucked with the county again
I'd rather take the risk of doin' 5 to 10
I'm not takin' a chance, I'm straight makin' a chance
So now we deserve to get what we wanna get
I got my mama up outta there
Because y'all motherfuckers just don't care
Uh, you really wanna know why I sold scum
Because my mama to me comes number one
Now you sucker motherfuckers don't understand
But to my mama, I'm her real black superman

[Hook: computer voice] [2x]
Now everybody know
Black superman
Now everybody sing
Black superman[Intro: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Round everybody up - Twiztid, Blaze, The R.O.C
I got a letter from the goverment
The other day I opened it and read and said it was bitches
- Cold 187, Legz Diamond, Anybody Killa, Doe Dubbla and ICP
A letter to the FBI

[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Somebody call 911 they gangbangin at the mall
A kid 14 and his boys from Omaha
Oh lord, Oh my God hes on a skateboard
FBI guy up in the tree... snore
Spying on the juggalo clique for 8 months
Undercover, ain't got nuttin, straight punks
Waisting everybody goddamn time and money
Cause you're some old out dated cops tubs and sonnies
Shit-headed and nerdy, like it ain't even funny
And the bitch in your ass is like bees to honey
Calling juggalo a gangbanger? - Outrageous
Pulling ninjas over whipping out gages
And the judge slams down the hammers
To the big house now for you gangbanger
If we let this be, we'll be face to face
With one man as he dictates the human race
Speak outta line, they coming at a zoomin pace
Kick you when you down, boots, two to the face
We don't need that, so don't give in now
Fuck the FBI it's how I'm livin', BLOW!


[Verse 2: Violent J]
Mr. FBI, Mr. Officer
Tell me why you want me in the coffin sir
Is it because I wear my hatchet tat
Or cause me and my fellas got matching chat
Is it because we like to hang out and be scrubs
Must be thugs out here peddling drugs
Well let me tell ya, all that meddling does
Is make us wanna leave you embedded in slugs
Free speech motherfucker, check this out
I want some pussy, or I'mma shot a cop in the mouth
Bang, guts hang like a wicked video game
It's all the same it's entertainment and it ain't for the lame
They can't get us so they come for those who walk wit us
Punish you for representin, make you wanna forget us
That's what we get, cause we ain't corporate
Self made and doing well so they damn us to hell
And degrade us, that’s what made us, they say the world hate us
For 20 years I've been getting paid to bust
Call me an old man, I call me long dick paid
Young sweet baby Violent J never gets played


[Verse 3: The R.O.C.]
Tensions high in new america, goddamn what's all of this?
So I walk around with mouth full of shit, spittin' shit
In the face lady liberty pushing swiftly through these days
In a block 300 looking like I'm straight about to bat cave
Government they now investigate so uptain
To windows looking too close will get you sketched, no incidental
Residential neighborhoods on high alert for the insane clowns
Anybody killing you get twisted and bound
Then set a blaze and murdered dummy
The Colds 187 don't just doubles every second
Who's the weapon? I am the R.O.C.!
A house full of skinny jeans, I'm kept in debris
I'm a disease and a cure for you sick and healthy M.C.'s
No resurrection from the clique, we gonna stay up underground
Saluting, never letting cock suckers putting us youth truth
The booth is a star, I walk the heavens keep it locked
We gon' rob the solar system on the shit until you stop


[Hook: Legz Diamond]
You can hurt our name
You can't solve our game
Fuck you and your claim
We don't bang, we're family!

[Verse 4: Cold 187um]
I'll pull a Tec' on you quick, I would say "fuck a bitch"
I spit, gangsta shit, I've been federally indicted, uh
I'mma killa from the west, don't test
Blaow, 187, the psychopathic
I come through, shut shit down, no bitch up now
I specialize in moving big dope and lettin' off rounds
So fuck the FBI, you know why they took 41 months of my life
Uh, that's why I ride or do or die, hustle world wide
Kick your door in, get your guap and back to the west side
No witnesses, a bloody homicide
Cause believe me, when I step ain't nobody gon' be left alive
The type of gangsta that plays for keeps, up deep in the streets
I got them bowls and birds for dirt cheep
So catch me in a old school classic
Reppin' the juggalos and everybody down with the hatchet

[Verse 5: Anybody Killa]
F is for the fools, B for bringing bullshit
I is my reply so yes, I feel included
Times really ain't changed, fans they says deranged
Music is the devil, and the artist is to blame
Juggalo I role, underground I stroll
Family is forever so this family will grow
I’m the FBI, Full blooded Indian
Back ready to ride, native pride once again
It's official, I had to go buy a new pistol
Just in case I hear the pigs whistle
Pull me over for a fucking purpose
Not because you worthless
Feeling like a criminal because I'm spittin' verses
Doctors, lawyers, dads and moms
Representin Juggalo cause they know it's the bomb
You can't stop psychopathic, the hatchet we jump hurdles
Even if you brought Elvis from the dead is John Burroughs

[Verse 6: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Don't blame me, not buildin a Bradley, it’s sad to see
You runnin your mouth and harassing the family
Trying to burn down my tree, cuttin' off branches
Like timber if you had it your way we'd be a cinder
You're far from heroic, you can't beat the stoic look on my face
As it changed from disdain to hate
Why you're spittin' your pulpit, I want to see your pores spit
All over the place till we're covered in all it
Toxic, no cure or antibiotics
You think we are so sick, we know you're neurotic
A build of psychotics, that drink and smoke chronic
Bitch you talking all that jazz, that's so sided

[Hook: Legz Diamond]

[Verse 7: Doe Dubbla]
Watch me blast off, laughin my ass off
Callin us a gang? Y'all high off bath salts
We hot as asphalt, they watchin us on every level
What if they told that you can't listen to heavy metal
What if they told that you had listen to the devil?
Fuck what they tell you, we some rebels so they persecute
We don't confirm the policies, so they hurt the youth
Cause we free thinkin, smokin tree, drinkin
They wanna catch us sleepin we ain't even blinkin
Fuck the feds, all my life they some suckas
I really think they mad, cause their wives wanna fuck us
The government don't wanna see me on some psycho shit
It's worse than the freeway sniper mixed with Michael Vic
Now they all fucked, wanna catch us in the twist
J Edgar Hoover you can suck the motherfuckin dick
And we ain't stopping till you take us off the fucking list

[Verse 8: Jamie Madrox]
Now I've been hustlin' and gridin' since I was new to the game
Before the songs and the videos and the screamin' the name
Before the diamond crusted hatchetman is swung from the chain
And I was greater than business, and all the trick to the trade
Learn to live it like I spit it, it's a family affair
A million painted faces in the crowd with hands in the air
All here to love us from above, and the devil rightly beneath
But the evil stares and shit talking can never compete
They wanna take us out the game and even call it a gang
Checking for tattoos and car stickers studyin slang
Man it's amazing how ridiculous this shit has became
Hoping that pride will go away but ours is strong and insane
It's only greater if anything below get heavy
But the goal stay the same, put the worries in the levy
People tell us everyday that we're the reason they survive
The true incentive of deeper hope alive, we don't die!

[Verse 9: Monoxide]
I been on that - fuck the law, middle finger to em all
A bitch who a line stepper, or a criminal rhyme shredder
Put a gun to your jaw, and make the world better
But instead I just shoot for the cheddar
And I can make you pearl jam and in my waist the Eddie Vedder
Looking for more them a bad rapper, I'm forever
Like Birdman baby, I'm so cash money
And the feds wanna ruin all that, now that's funny
I'll put a 5 hole in the 5-0
And I'm liable to emulate the face of a killa for my survival
Flat line your vitals, and I'm dangerous, and labeled a psycho
That ain't even the reason, they wanna keep us from the mic tho
My freedom of speech is what I would die for
FBI's my life long rival, cross-hairs and in scope of my rifle

[Hook: Legz Diamond][Eazy-E]
Perched up high on a roof top
Like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
A black hood covers my face
And death flows through my mind at it's own pace
Sometimes I feel like a super hero
Urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
Now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim and then my thoughts fail
My minds still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet
I put finger on the fit and then the side a check
I make the kill here's the deal
After the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
So it's the shots that sing out like a piper
Everyones scared I'm the neighborhood sniper

[Hook: Cold 187Um & Kokane]
Sum'ady, sum'ady, sum'ady run up get a lick lick
Everybody else I'mma shoot to kill
Bum bum﻿ bum had to murda 'em, bum bum had to murda 'em

[Eazy-E]
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
And simply scared the bitch boo
Being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
Take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
His bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
Now the room is red
Now there's nothing left but a snitch
Here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
One [*Shot*] two [*Shot*] three strikes your out
This nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase
Duckin' to an alley so they don't recognize my face
The boy had to pay the piper
So they all stayin' scared of the neighborhood sniper

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
I'm Doin' dirt as I continue my mission
Killin' all fools as an addiction
As the E, lovin' the game leavin' a shame
And in my heart I feel no motherfuckin' pain
Because my heart is cold as I was told
And with my A.K. 47 I stand bold
Rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
Pop pop pow, as I watch the motherfucker drop
Lovin' the site as the blood spill
Take a photograph, to keep in my hard as I was sayin' calm
And never hyper as I succeed in my mission
I be a neighborhood sniper

[Hook][Intro: KM.G]
"Yo, Cold 187. They tryin' to give you a murder rap. And you ain't even like that. Yo, serve these niggas, cause they deserve to get dissed."
(Yeah)
(Check this out)

[Verse 1: Cold 187um]
When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud and bold and Cold
187, that is my name, makin' it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I couldn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-Oss and Go Mack be cuttin' the flex tempo fast

[Hook] [4x]
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well

[KM.G]
Yo, fingerprints ain't nothin without the murder weapon
Keep steppin'
Homicide tried to sweat, but we let 'em have it
You can see they fear through they teeth
Treat 'em like Rolaids and give 'em some relief

[Verse 2: Cold 187um]
I feel action speaks louder than words and verbs
And adjectives, I live the life, the given gift
Not who's first, second or third
Not he said or she said or what you heard, nerd
Cause when you live like that, your life is mangled
In other words your life is all tangled up
I'm not a sucker, always go for mine
Powerlord that's hard from the start, and he will always (climb)
To the top as high as he can achieve
Sometimes that's even higher than the others believe
I'm not a doctor on a board, I don't have a degree
Not arrogant, egotistical, I'm the epitome
We take recon, these suckas are lying
Transform into another world as I recite these rhymes
187, he's as hard as it comes
And I don't have to brag
About the size of my gun, son

[Hook] [3x]
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well

[KM.G]
Criminals don't use lyrics and define themselves as notorious
Brothers gotta learn hip-hop anger rages inside themselves
Your ??? will never resist to my contact K-oss and the homie G

[Verse 3: Cold 187um]
187 breakin' back, backbone of my group
Fat kid in my posse and I'm gettin' loose
Cause I'm takin out posses, causin' bodily harm
Makin' moves to improve as I begin to brainstorm
I'm not inferior, not takin' no crap
Last sucker tried to diss me, cold got his neck slapped
Cause power's my name, sometimes I'm insane
And if I get too mad, I have to rearrange
Your position as a MC, that's the way it should be
The way I get over, I use terminology
That's comprehensive, redemptive
That's evidently not related to the style that you hear everyday
B-boy destroyin' a toy, employin'
While the other suckers are depressed, I'm enjoyin'
What I'm doin', and ruin anyone's hope for my position
Tell em KM.G, they on a mission

[KM.G]
They on a mission
They keep wishin you can't come off
187, you're a menace in your own mind
So take heed and proceed with caution
When he rhymes

Now I got a murder rap
Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancin'
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well[Intro]
Yeah (repeat 6x)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah say what
Yeah (repeat 6x)
Yeah, you are now tuned into the real deal
Yeah (repeat 6x)
You are now tuned into the real deal
Yeah (repeat 6x)

[Verse 1: Kokane]
It's like gangstas and ryders
Players with dreams
I put that ??? to pull my magazine
My nigga '87 told me up it is
???
So let's take these motherfuckers way back
I said I came in the do'
I said it befo'
All these bitch ass niggas stay down on the flo'
Cause if you fight me, fight me, step me on my mind
???
I'm gonna shoot you with my 9 I will raise 'em up
You know what I mean
Lost some hostages to make the getaway clean
Yeah, put backup ??? my 2-11
My name is Kokane and that's 187
Like the ??? in the ???
??? like our ??? Eric used to be

Boo yaa, right about now I'mma got to drop some flyyyyyy
Flyyyyy, some cooooooooooooooooooooooooool
And I'mma drop the bomb like this to you

[Verse 1: Cold 187Um]
Now, here's another way to get payin'
I'm million dollar nigga, not the million dollar man
G, I break a bitch like class
And if she give up a lyin' I put foot into her ass
Nigga, I smoke weed sometimes with the street hustlers
But you can cope some dope wine, and toss some 40s like a motherfucker
I think it's.. I'm about to move some fly shit up
I play it from the Old to New School, trick school up
You hooked to my style like a fiend on coke
It's like the moral junky you get, the mortal junky smoke
I don't slip, but I stalk with the whip
Cause I'm vocally pimpin, while I'm proud I'm gifted
But yo, once I'm pimpin, the whores all know I got a gang of them
Who gives a fuck if she claims somethin?
Cause late at night, I got the creeps on a whore
I throw a penny at the window, she be ready to go "OOOHHH"
I wouldn't treat like a sneak, I treated her just like a queen
Take straight to the Mongareen, and did the wild thing
Yo, then I went back to the set
And if my homies ain't stossin' out, I'm takin' none of bitches
Until it's gone if my homies can't have some "Sure baby"
What's the matter baby, I thought you wanna have some?
Cause you whore, is not our whores
And incase you didn't know, your bitch swings low
Flipped into a spot on a strip, break a fool off a mega somethin'
So don't trip cause I'm a South Central player and I gotta admit it
Last fool tried to fade this, we got him ass kicked
They call me a G but I ain't never gangbanged "Gangster"
Maybe because all the Keys I slanged
They call me hustler cause the money I make
You know, why they call you a player? ---] KM.G
Maybe because all the bitches I break

[Break:]
NOW HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE!!
Yeah, the industry is the filthy and I'm all up in it
NOW HOLD UP, IS IT SLICK?

[Verse 2: Cold 187Um]
Don't worry about it, baby, cause I got a fat dick
So here we go, here we go, here we go, C-O-L-D

How you gonna tell me where I'm ought to be within or where I been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
How you gonna tell me that you digged me when you digged whack dumbs?
They don't wanna understand where I'm comin' from ---] KM.G
No, I'm finna blockin' the bridges, just from these broke ass niggas
Who steal the rag from the flag and comin' up much faker
Cause I say: about ten years from now, I'll be finicially stable
And I can probably take the piles on a turn, look back over the field
To see my Ups and Downs, to see the caps I peeled
And see the people who are still, down for the crown
You know, I have to give a shout out to the underground "That was fly"
So players, let's just chill cause things are better
And remember like mostly boy, nothin' changes but the weather
Cause I'm the Coldest, the Colder, the 187
The one that's known to put the fly pimp shit together

[KM.G]
Plus, me the KM.G the mega dick on call
I'm the one that's known for bumpin' the walls

Alright players, Alright Gs

A group of underground lunatics brought together on mission
Of destruction
So all you bitches and hoes beware, for what lurks beyond in the darkness

So that's just the first clue from a nigga on a mission
You see, Chronic is way of life, Gs
So spray a peace to mothers and get butted the fuck out

Influential in amount, believin' in a certain theory
That all players must come correct
Either that or he'll gets no respect
You see, it's all about makin' yours in this life time
So with that said, I would like to introduce one more player in this game
A nigga named Shank, A.K.A. the Kane
A nigga known for breakin' suckas off
So y'all believin' in the theory of elevation
Reason bein, I got the fly... fly... shit for that ass

Funk them up, Funk them up, Funk them up

[Verse 1: Cold 187um]
Awww, comin' through the motherfuckin' side door
Checkin' all the niggas, and
Clockin' all the hoes
So before you jump up, and get wily like coyote
You better ask your bitch if she knows me (ooooohhhhh)
Cause I got two pounds of baking soda and two pounds of coke
I brought a bitch some Bamby, some papers, so I can smoke
(KMG)So you can call them when you want to, baby
Yah, right, because I've just told you homie the same two nights ago
Or should I say four scores ago
So bow wow, wow, wow, yippi yay, yippi yo, ho
Because to play you is my only wish
Yo, so pass me the skin so I can rush it like Emmitt Smith
And then I have to come boil that ass, toil that ass
Bump that ass and straight funk that ass
I guess you motherfuckers get the clue (what up?)
Soda for the cut up, chuckies to hop to "yeah"
I maybe in your Coupé, or Jeep or your Wagon
I maybe makin' dollars but I'm not braggin'
I give my props to my niggas in the Penhouse, see
For tryin' to come up, Gettin' caught up in the system G
It's like a game, never fit to win
So I'll see you when you get out if not when I get in (Well, alright)
Cause I'm not the Rodney King Part Two
So I'm a smoke one for me and smoke a gang for you

[Verse 2: KMG]
Then you're makin' a nigga, aww shit, the whore gigolo flow
Quick so... what's the word?
I've just set a verse to the hoes with the Deuce on the corner
The green eyed hooker with the juice and the totters
The true black macadamian in Funk pole
Hit the whores, get quick to fade Al Capone
Let me take my hat off
And peep my Madonna, sex magazines
Freak all the nymphos I'm a pussy fiend
Ooh, Mister Mister, twister twister is what they call me
Then they bone me
Hoes on my Diznick, I'm livin' a revelation
I'm kickin' the real shit, fuck the nigga's reputation (fuck it)
Go out to the dome, what up?, I'll straight fuck you
Or told my nigga Shake, .45 to buck you
Or I'm a trip and bring K-Oss at it
Or my nigga Mack fuckin' re-up to Pimp Clinic
So, I'm a ask you a question (what up Loc'?)
Do you wanna die for me? (yeah)
Or do you wanna die for my Kokane at 17-5 a key?

[Verse 3: Dirty Red]
Awww yeah, I sit leanin' on my toners when I'm bellin'
Through the crooked streets deep in Cali' where I'm dwellin'
Sellin' mobile dubs cause I gotta make a dolla'
Feelin' drop the top of my rag-top-grey Impala
I'm jerkin' a local nigga out the do it and sharin' dirt
Got two hoes on the corner and they feeling put in work
Now the pimps, though I ships my pimp
And on the down low, too many hoes will get a nigga in some trouble
And so I'm... bumped the three wheel motion
Hit the corner quick, feeling like the Chronic stick
And get higher than a motherfuker
I got a beap on the sky pager, trick ass bitch
Put the trick on time so it's off to the next day
Yeah, picked up my mobile phone, to make a booty call
Creepin' down Crenshaw, watchin' out for the law (yeah, the motherfuckers)
Cause the police quick to put the nigga on the side of the curb
And take a choke of my burb, G
And leaves a nigga like show
But I ain't want them up, I got the dope from the street motherfuckers

[Interlude: Cold 187um]
Aww yeah, The Aftermath
Journey through this Aftermath
Kokane is here
Here goes Kane, check this out

[Verse 4: Kokane]
Now I'm comin' around, comin' around, comin' around the fuckin' mountain
Wettin' niggas up like a motherfuckin' fountain
So don't clone me, don't get attached
Cause some of you niggas' styles more faker than a Wrazzaler Match
Added preservatives, artifficial flavors
Baking soda free, said I say a fuckin' savior
Give your R&B, house Music, I'll say hell no
Beatin' Donnie Simpson where I be funkin' on the show
Who gives the funk shit like that? you know it's We
Cause G shit came from the concrete
So take a seat in the back jack, known I gots to strap
No longer will there be a white motherfucker dictating what is real rap
You motherfucking hypocrites
Bring your ass as used to promote that heavy metal shit
To the K to the O to the K to the A, to that's N-E we flowwww
My name is Kokane, never askin' the reason I ball
So Bon Voyage I gots the stack
And I'm out Schwarzeneger but I'll be back
(Funkin' you)(*Sound of Billiards' balls and a cue stick striking left and right*)

[Opening Skit: Km.G as a Night Club chairman]
Look here Kokane

[Hook: Kokane Chanting]
Original ones, original criminal minds
Original ones, original criminal minds, yeah
Original ones, original criminal minds
Tah tah tah tah tat tat tat tah tah

[Verse 1: Kokane]
I'm just a poor black nigga tryin' to this
Wake up, wake up to smoke the mothafuckin' homeless
No pain no gain, you can call it dope but my name is Kokane
Yo Alkaholiks, pass me the bambay
Cause I got more Hook-ups than Yave and the Ese
I got a 13-5 well, alright
Cause I gotta slang my funk at 17-5 a key
Now, what's up homes?
I be rollin' in a bucket full of birds and a mobile phone
Now, you whores might laugh
But you won't now when I'm rollin' up in 500 Rack
Cause niggas be havin' fly chips from the crack
And you wonder why your mothafuckin' ass got jack, boy
You shouldn't have to talk shit from the start
Cause you got no bite but all bark, boy, yeah

[Hook: Kokane Chanting X2]
Original ones, original criminal minds
Original ones, original criminal minds, yeah
Original ones, original criminal minds
Ahwww, Ahwww, Ahwww, Ahwww
Tah tah tah tah tat tat tat tah tah

[Verse 2: E-Swift]
It's the westcoast soul, representin'
Funky like George Clinton
I'm in the house like a kitchen
Niggas talkin' shit all bark but no bite
Say, good night, I challenge whack Emcees to a fight
Bad Emcees, I smoke your head with the ruler from the old schooler
Punch your ass like Don Shooler
Hard Core, that don't rock no soft shit
I flow like water from the faucet
Aww shit, here comes the raw shit
Back the funk up, I fit your track, I stack you for the duke up
Rough and ragged like a truck
All bite but all you're bitin' is my style
I hit the 40 Ounce and then I'll get buckwild
Check, E-Swift is a title
Yeah, I usually rock scratches with the vinyl
Peace from the Alkaholik wino
And I know, I know, I know, I know what you're thinkin'

[Verse 3: J-Ro]
This groove is so funky that is stinkin'
My Dress code is simply, Jeans and shit
I can't get in the clef cause my description don't fit
Those with clothes, left to see a fashion shows
So I sneak in the rear, hop on stage and bust souls
I'm J-Ro the Human hight
I like to rock the party 'til the twilight
Grab the girl, take her home
Hit the room and bump my shine lights on
Have no fear, I'm your Number one Bear
And you can't come here, cause who wants to play the rear?
I see too many niggas get a brain blow out
Now, I'm headed upstream like a rainbow Trout
I refused to catch the blues in the ghetto
Now, I get paid, to bring kids to life like Gepetto
It's The Liks, baby, and we ain't goin' to get whack
So Pooh'll buy a bud, hook us up with the thick sack
So you can bark if you want to
Boy, I'm comin' in the cut with my whole mothafuckin' crew
I'm the man, you knew I came to bust the dandy Rap
So I'm funkin' in front like the Handicap
E-Swift, 187Um, Kokane and Ro
With a finger and a "F" for Darryl Gates before we go

[Outro: Cold 187Um as a Night Club Security Keeper]
Yeah, that mothafuckin' song is over
But y'all can take your drunk ass go rappin' little mothafuckin ..
Aww no, no, no, you got to go home
Bitch, you got to get the hell out here
No, no, no, bit touchin' there.. over there boy
No, just get, just get your ass up out here
No, no, no, all barkin' not bitin'
You can't fish eatin, aww, uhh.. won't let have any..
You stupid old mothafucker..
Aww, just get your ass hole up out here
I don't have no comprehension shit, boy

(*Music fades as people evacuating off the Night Club*)[Intro]
1999
The world's at its end
Fuck it
We want the money and the power
And go out with a bang

[Hook: Cold 187um]
Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my 9 put it on my chest bust some cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm coming from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' back
Can't fuck with Eazy
[w/ Kokane - several times]
Wet 'em up

[Verse 1]
This is a real life jack in progress
Nigga, give up your shit or take two to the chest with the cripness
Cause I ain't fuckin' around, G
So take a look at a real live nigga that's crazy
And get ready to die, loc
Any last words
Before your ass gets smoked, it ain't a joke
Because my pockets is broke my friend
That's why I gotta do you in
Give up your ends and your gold and your brand new Nike's
And anything else I might like
And then I'm off in the wind again
To catch the next sucker
Slippin' takin' two to the chin
I'm on a role two niggas in one night
Didn't even have to fight
Just pulled out my 9 to end anothers life
That's real life so forget the silly shit you heard
Now nigga tell me, do you have any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Another murder I committed made front page
A nigga dead from a drive-by, did him with a 12 gauge
The first stage of insanity
People say it ain't wise, to get faded of the St. Ides
A mother cries, another son lies in a casket
Life was fun while it lasted
That silly bastard had to get caught
Trippin' and set trippin'
You should have seen that niggas blood drippin'
To many lives took
To many hearts broke
But you don't hear me, you just see my fuckin' gun smoke
Some ask why do I take so many lives from
The innocent little ones
But where I come from
We take shit real
You peel caps so you get your fuckin' cap peeled
Grab your steel, forget about what you heard
It's do or die, nigga
Any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got the 9 and I'm pullin', straight creep
Feel I need to take anothers life, so I peep
Checkin' the scene but stayin' low
So I'm not seen, case I gotta get away
Gotta make the shit clean, G
So I'm lookin' for a victim
Gotta be right took my time and I picked him
Scoped shit, then I licked him
Now I'm back in the news no clues but yet another murder
You should have heard the nigga squill when I stuck his ass
I had to grin cause it's funny, nigga, fuck his ass
He ain't the last and surely ain't the first, G
But his monkey ass rolled away in a hearse, G
So I'm feelin' some what relieved
Just another day in the life of the Eazy
A real G, so forget the silly shit you heard
It's do or die, Eazy-E gets that last word

[Hook]Yeah.. ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier..

[2Pac]
The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob figures love to act up
The first to bomb when we rob niggas
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessey
Talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin' "Fuck the police," as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin' wild, towards danger
What's the cause?
Don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin' nigga unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Hook: singing + 2Pac]
Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..
(close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
(close your eyes)

[2Pac]
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin' bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two Glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder - then hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Hook] *
* last line: "close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"

[2Pac]
Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facin' sixty years, sheddin' tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the tier
Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death nigga
Take a breath come be the last one left nigga, it's real now
Feel it or fantasize it, ain't nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier

[Hook] *
* last line: "close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"

[2Pac]
This go out to Kato, Mental
All the niggas that passed away
Mutulu, Geronimo.. Seyku .. all the down ass riders
All the niggas that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggas that go through that day to day struggled
This is the ballad of a dead soldier!
All the niggas that passed on
All the niggas with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggas that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, shit
Them niggas'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin' block, fuck the cops!
The police? We run these streets nigga
Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!
These niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair
But nigga, you know - it's the ballad of a dead soldier![ INTRO ]
[ KM.G ]
Yo, what's happenin Cold 187

And we ballin with the homie Eazy-E
[ Cold 187um ]

So as the beat reaches a lower kind of level
We gon' put some mega shit together
Now we gon' drop it a little bit somethin like this

[ VERSE 1: Cold 187um & KM.G ]
This song is Ballin', let me drop some dope lyrics
Make it high and fly, so all of y'all can hear it
It's time to build, so take this chill pill
If your cups are empty, go get a re-fill
Of whatever, cause ain't nothin changed but the weather
KM.G - 187 - yo, we got it together
And in the back - who is that? The men with the mack
Yo, I had to have the homies cause they got the sack
And on the tables - what? The two be cookin
When it comes to rockin, they wrote the book, and
If you don't believe me, hurry, come see our show
You'll see me - KM.G, Total K-oss and Go
What? Ballin while the freaks keep callin
Beggin KM.G to come bump the walls in
The house, but even if she has the spouse
(What's up?) She starts that fiendin (what happens?) she gets turned out
And at our concerts we always do work
For the fags, the hags, the rags and the jerks
Cause we ballin

(I'ma recite a little poetry for y'all
The name of this piece is called)
Ballin'
(And I wanna dedicate this piece to all your players)

[ VERSE 2: Cold 187um & KM.G ]
See, I'm a baller, and I watch my back
And when I'm ballin, yo, I gotta be packed
If I ain't packed homeboy, you could say I'm slippin
But if you try to run up, I'ma say you trippin
Cause I'm a giant, and to you new jacks
Don't come up and start, because you're gonna get smacked
It's the hood, I thought it was understood
Just like Eazy-E said we mobbin Robin Good
We'll take yo shit, because you ain't legit
You got a fucked up style of rap and without the kick
It ain't nothin homie, you be frontin
Rollin down the 'Shaw and you think you be humpin
On laces? He look just like a lacehead
Before you hit my corner, somebody be dead
Cause I'm a baller, and I won't settle for less
Put Lorenzos on my Benzo, so I know it look fresh
A 500 with a convertable top
Just like the homie Amp we like our shit drop
Straight lowrider, yeah, we do a little ???
Smooth check your ho, even if I don't know her
And as I enter the door, watch the freaks start callin
The simple fact is (what's up) that we ballin

(I'ma recite a little poetry for y'all
The name of this piece is called)
Ballin'
(And I wanna dedicate this piece to all your players
And all you ladies out there)

And you know we gotta break it down for who?
(The whole wide world)

[ VERSE 3: Cold 187um & KM.G ]
Since the breakdown was dope, you can't get enough rappin
I know that it's true, because I seen your hands clappin
Toes tappin, the freaks are jockin
All because the way 187 is rockin
All you busters on the scene
I keep my Locs on because I know you on fiend
Like a spectator, you jock what I'm doin
So sit back and learn, cause it's time for some schoolin
And rulin all the busters on the center
Get off my tip, cause I'm about to enter
This phase (what is it?) that I call the finale
I made it ride higher while I'm ballin through Cali
So listen, I'm finna start dissin
All you Eastside rappers, you had to start pissin
Me off, you're soft, you're finna get tossed
By two boss players who's your dope rhyme sayers
K-oss and Go Mack are the wack-deejay-slayers
You got a beep? We gotta go,cause money is callin
The simple fact is - yeah, that we ballin

And you know
It's like that in 90
And it's gon' stay like that
And once again we have to send it to who?
(The whole wide world)
Who's it dedicated to?
(The whole wide world)
To who?
(The whole wide world)
Dedicated to who?
(The whole wide world)
It's dedicated to
(The whole wide world)
Sendin it out to
(The whole wide world)
It's dedicated to
(The whole) (world) (wide)[Intro]
1995 and Compton's still up in this motherfucker
Yeah, this album's dedicated to all you real niggas
But most of all it's dedicated to you bitch ass niggas

[Verse 1]
Who is it? The bitch made nigga killa
I'm swingin' on niggas ever time I feel 'em
Cause niggas walkin' 'round with their ass out
So I'll be droppin' funky shit till they pass out
These bitch made niggas swingin' on the dick
Back the fuck up before I have a fit
I'm peelin' niggas caps, makin' gang of snaps
Be true to this shit with hard motherfuckin' raps
187 bitch slappin' on the track
Makin' fools break theyself like as if it was a jack
Keep a big stick just incase I gotta swing
The heater is the mack, stashed at the shack
So while your rollin Danas in your force mobile
Just remember motherfuckers the shit caps I peel
Niggas just a piece of cheese for a hood rat
Falsin' for a hooker and I never understood that
Cause it's the same old shit everyday and every night
Cause nigga Ren won't put it down if the shit ain't tight
So listen to the funk as I deal a
Blow to a bitch made nigga, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

[Hook] (x2)
You know the color, the villain is in black
Bitch made niggas better watch they backs, hooker
You know the color, the villain is in black
Beatin' niggas down and it's like that, fool

[Verse 2]
And I'm stalkin', walkin' in my khaki suit
Tryin' to see what niggas I'm a have to shoot
This ain't a bang-bang boogie like the new booty flow
New niggas tryin' to do the shit I did years ago
Cause if it ain't rough it ain't E-motherfuckin' nuff
You bitch made niggas, here to call your bluff
Pull your ho card, like my nigga Kam said
Crack my big stick up against your damn head
Yeah, radio suckas never play me
But you can hear bitch made niggas on daily
Ren gonna have to put his foot down
Motherfuckers ain't gonna like how it's put down
So mic check one, whatever I don't give a damn
Me be ready to slam, when I hit the jam
So yell controversy when I bust the rhyme
No more irresistible bitch made niggas in '99
Black reign is coming, niggas it's bad weather
Whenever 187 and Ren get together
And listen to the funk as I deal a
Blow to these bitch made niggas, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hypocrite niggas always runnin' they mouth
From the north, to the east, to the west, and south
Cause the freaks come out at night
And all bitch made niggas be comin' cause they don't have no friends
So don't come around playin' double-O 7
Cause your ass might get caught in a two-eleven
Niggas don't call me 'less the video is poppin'
Only come around when my new shit's droppin'
Niggas ain't nothin' but some hound dogs I betcha
You bitch made niggas didn't know that I was the bitch catcher
I'll choke ya with a grip
Stranglin' motherfuckers not comin correct, so don't slip
Real niggas don't die, so I'm still alive
Fuckin' up shit in '94 and '95
Cause I'm livin' like a hustler
Busta, heard you was talkin' that shit so ya musta
Thought it wouldn't get back to me
Niggas ya shoulda thought a million times before you tried to do me
But listen to this funk as I deal a
Blow to you bitch made niggas, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

[Outro]
You know the color, the villain's in black[Intro]
"You heard about what's going on in here?"
"Heard a lotta bullshit cocked, I know that much."
"This isn't bullshit, my friend."
"Do you know something?"
"Don't listen."
"What do you know?"
"Maybe I do and maybe I don't. What I say is that they ain't got no business negotiating. We gonna be going back in they're with a bullet for everybody in the yard."
"Is that right?"
"We do it now, we do it later, later it can be new use. Am I right Al?"
"Well, wait, wait, wait minute Frank. We gotta a lotta angry guys in. They're black muslims, Panther's, Young Lord. Besides you average anti-social."
"So we gotta go in right, clean their clocks."

[Verse 1: KM.G]
I hit the loose juice and pulls up in the deuce
He gives me the scoop about the fake ass troops
And how niggas out there wanna play
I take another hit of the way and then I blast away
[Hutch:] "How far, playa?"
Far enough to go off the edge
I push another nigga off the ledge
So I stumble as I slide to the Chevy
Yeah, my eyes kinda teary and gun kinda heavy
I'm a walking dead man is what they call me when I'm comin'
Got the big S on my chest, so I'm kinda gunnin'
High powered on my way to the west side
To check upon on some chickens, it's a hell of a drive, so drive on
As I hit my dodo stick to the breaking dawn
Crime fighting's what I do and niggas in my crew
Don't take lightly to you bustas and so we say fuck you
Then buck you, tuck you in for the night
As you think about the paper at the funeral site
So when I'm hangin' with the clique, and we in demand
I feel good that the city of angels call me black superman

[Hook: 2x]
Now everybody sing
Black superman
Now everybody know
Black superman

[Interlude]
*phone rings*
[Hutch's answerphone:] "Yo this Hutch, I ain't in right now. But uh, leave a message at the beep. You know I'm out flossin' and tossin', dippin' and trippin'. You know what I'm sayin'?"
[KM.G:] "Aye Hutch man uh, they just leavin' yo mama's house, um, I don't know what they got but, um man, they lookin' for us, man. Call me over at Peach's house."
*hangs up phone*

[Verse 2: Hutch (aka Cold 187um)]
Now it was once said by a known loc G
Always tryna come up, yeah, and that's a G
Uh, cause when I bomb it's like a curse
Cause see, once in a lifetime everybody did some dirt
I guess it got to me the same
So at the age of 15, I entered the dope game
I had my game locked up tight
In the day I went to school, but I clocked all night
And when I went to class I always felt asleep
But I was out like a motherfucker, if somebody beeped
My teacher said, "Boy, can't it wait?"
I said, "No, I got to put some mo' icing on my cake."
I think I saved about 50 G's
I bought a truck, a house, and a Coupé on D's
Mom is trippin but she really don't know
All I'm thinkin' is she ain't on the county no mo'
Before my mama fucked with the county again
I'd rather take the risk of doin' 5 to 10
I'm not takin' a chance, I'm straight makin' a chance
So now we deserve to get what we wanna get
I got my mama up outta there
Because y'all motherfuckers just don't care
Uh, you really wanna know why I sold scum
Because my mama to me comes number one
Now you sucker motherfuckers don't understand
But to my mama, I'm her real black superman

[Hook: computer voice] [2x]
Now everybody know
Black superman
Now everybody sing
Black superman[Intro]
Meow
The Korean cat chow chow is now open for suggestions
And hoes, what's the flavor of the month
Niggas!
Now what you gonna do?
You little dick trick
But for now, go G
The floor is yours
Take it

[Verse 1]
I'm teaching you old dog how to turn new tricks
And all of my lessons got you begging for the dicks
Stupid bitch
Day after day, your niggas causing me
Say your knees baller, and he wants to be balling me
You see, I don't think so, no not this ho
Not getting pussy, but I'm getting all this dough
And though you got a strong arm, the game that I'm running on
I'm getting paid, and you're the one that's coming on, bitch!
I'm just a body snatcher, and II'm snatching all his money
Getting hungry?
Come take a taste of my honey
An attitudedy ho is what I am, motherfucker
I'll give you lollipop so you can lick me like a sucker
Step the wrong way, yo, I don't play
So I just pull out my nine, or I just blast with my AK
So with your man throwing clay, I'm a catcher
Sign your G O D I, the Body Snatcher

[Hook]
You can be the bitch, but I'll be the ho
Yeah, a better motherfucking ho!
(4X)

[Verse 2]
I'll take your man with all 36-23-39 of me
You can't stop me, punk bitch, can't mock me
If you were settling your business, taking care of your dick
You wouldn't have fiend him, my pussy wouldn't have got licked
While you was at home cussing and having a fit
I met your nigga still sporting all his new shit
So think twice before you call me a bitch
In fact, call me a ho with an attitude, you know
You started sweating me, check your nigga
Cause Babygirl is the worst kind of gold digger
He's treating me like his main freak
You wonder where his paycheck go every damn week
Oh yeah, keep thinking that your nigga's at work
It's an off day, and he's fucking to get under my skirt
So if you're tripping and he won't get cock chop
He's fucking Babygirl, the Body Snatcher

[Verse 3]
Punk motherfuckers on my strap, but don't sweat it
Turned out to get me sprung, but I like the way he wet it
Nice firm ass with a pretty brown dick
I like the way he work it, but he nut too quick
Grabbing on his shit baby still he got a grip
Coming down my thighs, while he spread between the hips
The talking was good, but I don't mean to be rude
But your nigga is sprung on a ho with an attitude
24/7 got a nigga in check
And when he get done, cum is dripping down his neck
You uptight bitching but I would thought you knew
He's chasing up under my cat like a dog does, too
He's not the one to blame, it's a motherfucking shame
I'm running much game, now your dog's been trained
Don't talk shit if your man's been captured
But that's how it is when a ho's a Body Snatcher

[Hook][Intro]
Welcome to America

[Dr. Khalid Muhammad]
Good evening, this is the truth hour
And don't you touch that dial
Just stay tuned in, to the truth hour
I didn't come to lighten up, I came to tighten up

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Niggas, here I come, black nigga, the guerrilla
Busting shit, who is it? - it's the Bitch Made Nigga Killa
I control the streets, shit is all underground
Niggas gotta step the fuck back, when I come around
Nigga, fuck the police, the white one, the black one
The Mexican, the Japanese can all suck deez
Cause how in the fuck can you serve this government?
That be plotting to kill niggas, they want to steal niggas
Here we are today, 30, 40 million strong
Handkerchief-headed niggas saying ain't shit wrong
Niggas don't give a fuck about your three strikes
That's why I give you hell when I'm busting on the mic
I got niggas in the cut of the ninety-one
Niggas in the streets selling heaters, I'mma find me one
And off them devils off from the shack
Fools going crazy cause that nigga Ren is back

[Verse 2: Cold 187um]
What's up, dog? - it's on once again, let them fools know
When we're coming through, we're straight giving you the voo doo
Keep it real, if you like it or you don't
Working hard like bugs, straight have know what the fuck we want
I bought a house in the suburbs
Next to the homie Wade, I made a killing off them birds
White folks straight mad as fuck
Because I'm rolling in a Benz and a 30 thousand Dollar truck
Yo, I takes mine, yo, when I shakes mine
On the real, the government labels me a flatline
And Uncle Sam gives a fuck about me
That's why I'm spitting in this phase on the Ren LP
Yo, he more wicked then a horror flick
Think you won't, high powered mandate to a five dollar bitch
Yo, they say America the land of the free
But the first thing I have seen was slavery, fool

[Hook]
So is you scared of me?
Four hundred and thirty nine years of slavery (Slavery)
And we still ain't free
But we supposed to act like we're living in harmony
(Bring it on, you've got to bring it on)

[Verse 3: Triggerman]
I pledge allegi' to the flag
When I'm rolling down the block in my ride
But it's.. it's your rag
Yeah, I stick hand tight
I drop a kite to my nigga in the Pen' doing ten
I put a nigga in a cage, but I'm never on his back
While Uncle Sam straight stack
I wish they let them fly like the pigeon in the wind
But every nigga in the Pen' alive
With one point to get every three sixty five
Say you gotta keep up, if you're on the main line
You gotta hurt some, while you're in the chow-line
So if you wanna survive don't let them eyes sleep
Even when you hustle on the streets

[Verse 4: KM.G]
Yeah, break myself never
However, I'm in this so scrilla
The Clinic gang running thangs up, so I smell trouble
Gathering up at the shack, cause Ren's got my back
187's got a sack, and I got a sack
So bring it on, we get the whole country high
Above the Law, the crooked letter, a year supply
Then they get upset, cause we set up shop, in their hoods
And start slanging them no goods
We should go uptown, and poison the suburbs
Have all them white fellows straight going to the curb
Instead they slide down to our block
(Just to get a bit of that Peruvian rock)
Ain't no gun factories in Gardena
Ain't no poppy fields popping out in Pomona
I bought my steel from a white man
My works from the S-A-M
My interiors be looking hitting corners, Huh

[Hook]

[Outro: Dr. Khalid Muhammad]
You with me?
Cause I got to drop this stuff tonight
Because I'm a truth terrorist
I'm a knowledge gangster
I'm a black history hitman
I'm a lie killer, urban guerrilla
I gotta be a roughneck
I gotta be a roughneck
It's the only way I know to go[Intro: Lay Law]
You've now entered the quest to, the black triangle
Now you know the reason for the Black Mafia theory, hahaha
Yes it has many meanings, but no matter how you define it
It still comes out black
See it's just a hair trim
So you can call it what you want

[2Pac]
Now I clown around, when I hang around with the Underground
But when I'm with the Mafia I'm droppin' you
And if you're a ho then I'll be knockin ya, baby why not
You shouldn't jock me cause I'm popular
The group with the Glock, I love to pop the gun
Coppers get shot, they shouldn't try to stop the Mafia
2Pac'll pack a person, pump the trunk
I'm bumpin G-Funk, but you can call it what you want
How many times I gotta tell ya, don't ignore me
Either be my ho or hit the do', you're nothin for me (see ya!)
That's why I love to go on tour G
Scores of whores behind the door, a nigga's known now, I'm sippin on a 40
So you can call it what you want just pass the blunt and kick it Money

[Money B]
Well, I am the danger, THE DANGER, similar to a killer
I rhyme for rounds of conflicts chomp and stomp em while y'all chillin
In Tokyo, check it as I choke a slow poke rapper
Capped his ass faster, than a half of pound of crepes'll go on Mother's Day
First and fifteenth, another way of sayin it
I got new clips so trip but it's OK to get your crew
Cause ooh I'll send your team to the showers
They true and do and rippin and got the Wonder Twin powers
I devour much venom, lunch breaks I shit em, I just stink
Whaddya think, this is a threat?
Just forget about a come back, you're done black
See Cutty was the stopper
But you'll call me the indo when I chop ya with the shopper
Sting ya with the stinger, flex the trigger finger
I blow you to bits and I be gettin a kick out of grabbin the mic and flingin
Lyrics with the maximum security crew
I smoke a spliff but I'm not Jamaican
So why don't you let a Yankee Doodle do what he has ta
Raise my hand and cast a
Hellafied spell you can't tell you better ask a
Weatherman he'll sigh and reply, "You shoulda stayed in the house"
Cause Mon is gonna rain on their parades

[Cold 187um]
Nowww, clear the smoke, and grab a fool by his throat
And don't let him go til he holla holla billygoat
Now Money Money Money B, once said to me
"187 why you wanna be a G?" Welllll..
I like to clock big G's, and hang out all night
And never worry bout a bitch, cause she can't tell me shit
Plus, money money is a pimp thang (what?)
Cause see if you was in my shoes, you'd be doin the same
So don't ever ever fuck, cause I'mma G and player hustler
Cause when I'm bustin on a mic I could never be a customer
Now peep this, cause when I'm goin deep
The only customers gettin served in the housssse, is the pussy I freak
They wanna pop that ying-yang
I tell em, "Sit down, shut up bitch, and let me kick game" (y'know)
Cause hoes always be sayin they got it goin on but if they wanna
Get with a nigga like me they gotta pay a fee, I am not
The No Mack Nigga, from the planet called Silk
I'm from the planet Black Mafia Life, that freaks pimps
Yo, come take a sip of the psycho-mega-
Pimpsome-hoesta-must-be-a-playa
Now hold up, wait a second (Background Girls)
Nah, I fucked you bitches on the last record, yo
It's like I'm high on a raggamuffin spliff
Me the dope sound what a man, the myth (come)
Mon they wanna see me fade shit, like I did last year
So I POST on em, then I COAST on em
No I never never never had a murder rap
And if you snitch you say I did it you're bound to get your neck snapped
So there it is, and how it's gonna be
So I pass the joint, to my man KM.G

[KM.G]
Well you can call it what you want but if you don't
I'm still a nigga with a pimp strut, ooh, a macadamia nut
I said what you want, I'm workin' for a you-ohh
Well alright, you little silly ass ho
Now when you wanna rendezvous and get tramped (get tramped)
Give a call to the clinic, ATL's the pimp camp
And see which playa, is up for the downstroke
(Cause you skeez-in, cause you broke)
So toast them hoes like I said before
I fuck four bitches a day, and I'm lookin for more
Cause cords of scores of hoes be leavin my house
Like, BAM, and I'm like, DAMN
Now my niggas done labelled me the dangerous neighborhood nasty man
Cause they know I can
When you wake up in the morning I only give ya five pushes
I'll be out by your garage, awaitin behind the bushes
Drinkin' coffee, smooth waitin to talk see
Like a true ho gigolo should be
See I'm a giant and the rest of them are fakers
Especially when it comes to the bitches and they moneymakers
A simp nigga hesitate to diss you tramp but I don't
So here's the Black Mafia so, you can call it what you want

[Hook: Cold 187Um]
Ooh, you can call it what you want
Well, you can call it what you want
Well, you can call it what you want
Well, you can call it what you want
Well, you can call it what you want

[Outro: Lay Law ]
You are just had your experience of that new funktiers
So kick back and let that good shit in your vibe to get shopped, ha ha
Welcome to the motherfuckin...[Intro: Kokane]
That's right, yeah, uha
Yeah, I like R. Kelly, he cool
My name Kokane, and I'm a Pisces
And I love them ho's, and they love
You understand?

[Verse 1: KMG]
Eight booty bitches in the naked city
Fly bitches shakin' asses and hell of titties
Contemplatin' how the homies should penetrate
As we watch little Tina while she masturbates
She looks up and she pointss to my nigga E
Then she grabs the fifth of some Hennessey
She took it to the head put the bottle between her legs
Then she brings my homie Trigger to dig
Just another freaky tale in the Westcoast
Cause after 12 O'Clock we be poppin' the most
Niggas fiendin, to slap some ass, tap some ass
And they ain't givin' a fuck about their past
Now, we got naked ladies, layin' all over the room
Life lights with the nascent fume
Though the homies gettin' twisted of that major Kiah
Pimp Clinic got them ho's for hire

[Hook]
[Cold 187um] That's the world we have
[Kokane] That's the world we have
[Cold 187um] That's on every friend we have
[Kokane] That's on every friend we want y'all
[Cold 187um] That's the world we have
[Kokane] That's the world we love
[Cold 187um] That's on every friend we have
[Kokane] That's on everybody, that's on every friend we love y'all

[Verse 2: Triggaman]
Ugh, welcome to the thrilla in Manilla
Can you relate, with the armor cap peeler?
Chillin' the most, cause I claim the westcoast
And I love givin' a toast to the bookie
And freakin on some booty
See, the Clinic got a hell of a night
Donna Karan L.A. and the fume(?) is right
Bailin' with the quickness to the freak show
Pocket full of classics and I need more ho's

[Verse 3: Enuff]
To have more whores is what a nigga pleasure
I got more moves than any whore can measure
Yeah, I put take them to the cleaners
You still callin' my mom, askin' have you seen him
But she's happy cause I'm outta state
Trip incase, peep the next holiday
Now, I wanna play with mo' ends than I can explain
What I got game, I'm headin' to the first came
Speak some words and took them home with me
Freak them with the chronic, I get nasty

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Cold 187um]
Now, I be bailin' down to show with my dick out
Ready to be this seed inside bitches' mouths
So don't you ever trip child, I come with so much stizyle
And all you bitches out there wanna know what I'm about
Cause I be hittin' back, sissies askin' have me a child
Have him grown, black, skinny, and tall
Got the conversation too, what you gonna hear, baby
How you got these niggas out here, straight livin' shady
There's one thing I know about these upon California squeezes
Yo, they be sneakin, they be freakin'
And they be down for the get down, when the gettin' be good
From Calabashies to Inglewood, you bitches know that I'm the man
Cause when I come through, I straight like jam
What y'all know about the techs flow though?
187 show, boo Yaa woow

[Hook]

[Bridge: Cold 187um]
You got to have that with the sickness
You got to get back on your feet
You got to use the mind
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
You got to have that with the sickness
You got to get back on your feet
About to lose my mind up in these streets

[Hook][Intro: female voice]
"This is Michelle Devine, coming to you live from the hoods finest, WALZ. I gotta give a shout out to my homegirl Mimi. She just broke up with her man. Hey, I always say if you can't break a nigga, then shake the nigga. This next song is goin' out to all the players. Somethin' new from Above the Law called "Concreat Jungle"."

[Verse 1]

[KMG]
I say what's up fool, I'm kickin' it with my partners
I'm checkin' with my homies and we movin' shit proper
I peep a magnum bitch, I'm wonderin' what she thinkin'
She say 'What you lookin' at, pimp?'
I'm wonderin' what this ho was drinkin'
As she greased that ass in the place
And then the pimp clinic recognized the face
It's the same old bitch with the jack move
Real smooth, with nothin' to prove

[Cold 187um]
So, here comes the 5-7 sniper
Bitches can't dance if they can't pay the piper
Tryin' to make a G like every single day
I'm sippin' on some Alizé, rollin' in the rag top trey, yo
A young nigga tryin' to have it
Doin' it like I'm doin' it, is an everyday habit
Do I do a lick, or do I call a caper
Cause I'm like sprung off the motherfuckin' paper

[KMG]
Now, now, now niggas wanna know where we get it from
We play dumb, then they ask can they get some
No, you gotta step cause you can't bring the funk
And if I gave you a chunk you'd probably skip town punk
And run and tell your motherfuckin' bitch or two
Or your ho, cause you thought the clinic had no clue
Now scandalous motherfuckers get broke to they knees
As the click run in ya like the AIDS disease

[Hook] (x2)
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin' in the concrete jungle
Everybody wanna know, how you get that cash flow

[Verse 2]

[Cold187um]
Now I'mma get straight to the point cause I'm here
And just like Shaq I'mma slam the pill
On the real, so chill, cause fools be tryin' to loc up
Fuckin' around with my they only get they ass broke up
Or broke down, cause niggas be tryin' to clown this shit
But find out that I don't play the bitch
Yo, the last nigga tried to play me like a ho
Got popped with my motherfuckin' 4-4

[KMG]
So, now you know what its like to get clipped to the other side
We rowdy when we in the G ride
We dumpin' out the window, K-Oss blaze the indo
Suckers at the door, nah, it's Nina Flow
Back up off me, we about to wreck shop, take shop
It's niggas on the list that might get mobbed up
So, if they don't cut with the quickness
Cause we always strappin' 9's to help with the thickness

[Cold187um]
Cause if you're soft, you'll never ever get no fuckin' props
You're funky on the block, snitchin' to the fuckin' cops
Like KM.G say you better back up
Cause when you play the pussy boy, you get fucked
Cause I'm cold, leave you ass stuck like Subzero
Jump that ass out and rip out your torso
See that's the price when you're fuckin' with the real
So take my advice and just chill

[Hook w/ several variations]

[Outro: same female voice as in the intro]
"Yeah, I told you it would be the bomb. Right now, I wanna give a shout out to everybody on the west side kickin' it, everybody on the east side doin' they thang. I got a message for Tyrone: Dede say she don't wanna be with you no more. Damn, it's a cold world. And Pam: GQ from the east side said that ain't his baby. Girl, you better check that nigga, or check yourself. Oh, Shawn: Pea just called in. She said that was fucked up the way you played her last night at the club. Said everything's alright, she just wanna know who that ugly bitch was you left with. Anyway, I gotta get out. The word for the day is paper. If you ain't got none, you better get some and if you don't know how you get it, you better learn."[Verse One: KMG]
See I wakes up in the afternoon
Somewhat kinda slow
I'm thinking about the homie he just got caught
He ain't never bang befo'
Yeah, it's '97 it's too late for that shit
I don't trip, I take a sip
And then I think I'm still drinking
Yeah the hood is leaking
All my little freaks is like creeping
Then I found out
All them niggas we put down was like bitches
Motherfucking snake ass bitches
See, never no mo' slipping
I'm still tripping how they say 'Pac gone
But I still hear them songs
I guess the real niggas feel it
And all the cowards around the world really didn't
(I know they didn't)
See I need's a new bag to bag big head Monopoly money
It ain't funny
A nigga need them bills to fold
When I roll, we in the industry we like hoes on a stroll
So I'ma stick a nigga fo' I go
See ah, my youngest daughter she like spoiled
So if I have to sell a gang of cavi and spread my soil
I'ma do this cause my nigga's rent due
Plus all that little shit that me and Kaos done been through
Plus collaborations from my nigga Hutch
He keep a nigga pocket broke huff
Ha
No no' swap meet, 10K
A nigga feel good on a stroll through Coitier (who wanna play?)
I still hang with my niggas that sell that shit
I tell you how much it cost and where to get it
ATL got clientele so you know that we gon' flip it
Riding wild in the west with a meal ticket

[Hook]
Sometimes I can't fight the feeling
These setbacks they come by the millions
Life is one big escapade
You won't know till it's too late
Sometimes I can't fight the feeling
These setbacks they come by the millions
Everyday's an episode
Can you handle the load?

[Verse Two: Cold 187um]
Now I was told to sit down and shut when grown folks speak
And keep your head in them books fuck them streets
But instead I be out here and with my next of kin
Trying to dodge doing 20 in the pen
So count me in
On the half of them two thangs
So I can paint a much brighter picture for my frame
And count change
My baby mama think that I'm a bank
She thinks my car is always on a full tank
Yeah, mama be telling me to slow down
Take a deep breath
And take a step and look around
Uh, yeah
Cause I don't think that I can grind forever
I got to trust who I can trust and put up with bad weather
I shake broads to the left
Cause I don't know who gon' try to gank me and shank me for my wealth
Yo, I learn from my great uncle Ken
That there's a thin line between you and your ends

[Hook](Intro- Cold 187'um)
Yeah what's up Kokane
"what's up player"(cold chillin'in this muthafucka)
Yeah we're just go on laid back in the studio, man on this groove
And talk about some muthafuckas, that we don't give a fuck about
(definetly don't give a fuck about, you know what I'm saying)
On some fly fly funk shit, (you know what I'm saying)
Some shit that niggas bit, "what's up partner ha ha ha-
I'm talkin to you Dre, don't bite my shit
Don't bite the funk that feeds you
Cause I sure the hell don't need ya
Ha ha what's up..
Yeah.. now while we're in the studio kickin' it off
(you know what I'm saying)- on the ill tip
You know, I wanna do some old school
You know, I wanna just kick some shit off
And show them muthafuckas I mean buisness -(you know what I'm saying)
So ah when the clock strikes to six
I'mma put them hoes in the mix (hi hi hi hi)
And I'mma do it like this for them ( ya know what I'm sayin')

(Cold 187'um)

Ahh yeah ahh
1-87 chillin' in my coup dippin'
One thing I can't stand is when fools get the set trippin'
Now I was down with the gang truce
Until I found out you was gettin' ganked by Dr. Suess
Now you can get Compton, Long Beach
South Central, Watts, Carson even Pomona
You can even ran to Timbuktu
But I'mma creep through the fog bitch and I'mma smoke you
Now I'mma take you through you history book
Uh ah let's take a look
Yeah- when I first came to Ruthless I was livin' like hustler
But see you, you was livin' straight like a busta
I used to think you was a troop
'til I remembered you was in the muthafuckin' Wreckin Cru
And then I looked at an old album cover
It was you chillin' lookin' gay as a muthafucka
I could have took it any kind of way
But see six months later you were NWA
And now it's gangsta gangsta pimpsta pimpsta
But to me you was still wimpsta wimpsta
Yeah you dissed Eazy-E but I'm confused
Cause you're scared as fuck to diss Ice Cube
Yeah now you're all straight smilin'and trucin'
But remember "yo Dre, stick to producin'"
Now you say you ain't gettin' gangked no more
But I know who owns Death Row.. really doe
Yo I got a little piece of paper from someone
And not one line on it reads Andre Young
You try to diss my record deal, but I'm still quick
I'm on a mission, and I'm going for the fuckin' gift
So next time your in the place
I'm hollering 1-8-7 with my Glock in your fuckin' face
Cause real niggas don't go out that quick
So it's cool that you bit my shit- bitch
Cause I'm a baller by far and plus a G
And I like my chronic twist with some VSOP
See broke niggas can't buy it cause it costs ends
Shut the fuck up, you're just Dre's broke friend
Snoop Dogg you better get your paper work right
Because if not you'll be all bark with no bite
Yo- see we go kinda back see
But see things got fucked up when your flunkie tried to diss me
You need to go and check your puppy, G
Because who the fuck is he, to jump up and diss me
Cause I'm a nigga with a gang of funk
And I'mma show the muthafucka to keep my name out his mouth
Yo- I never got smoked you muthafucking new jack
You fuckin' around with me you gonna end up on your back
Yo try to diss me to get respect
But you sounded like a muthafuckin Redman reject
I give props when props are due
And my props to you is muthafucka fuck you
You're just a flunkie for the D-R-E
You punk muthafucka, you wannabe G
And you know I always drop the shit proper
You can ask your homies or you can ask the doctor
But he don't get no props neither
I'mma say it on wax and I can say it when I see ya (fool)
Try to kick it like you got stamina
Whoop that ass like Luke did in Atlanta
Oops did you slip, did you trip, did you run
Did he have a gun, did you want some
No I don't think so (ah well)
Here's a bone you can choke
Get your ass with the mafia loc
Yeah fool, so what you wanna throw up
Cause you're broke as a muthafucka
Lookin tore up
But I'm the original 1-87 no one can do it better
So I'm out, and peace to my homie Snoop
Yo I hope you get yours before they do you- yeah
And that's realer then a juice of a duce
See some might not like it but yo it's the truth

(SweetTalk (aka Kokane) )

Boop boop be doo- well alright y'all
Yes lordy, ah some say it's like the Peanuts Gang
I took your house off ya Snoopy- well a wrong
Say Dre, my name it's Sweet Talk
Now do you belive in funk after death?
Cause I do, so watch this

(Kokane)
It's like dip-dip-a-la we got to make a stack
We can fix your funk when the shits on the flat
Pump pump you up, send you on your way
And I don't belive in celebratin' Dre day
It's like "Hear ye, hear ye! Come one, come all!"
Kokane is servin suckas at the players ball
If you come up the deal
You will get blasted
A tisket, a tasket, we throw your body in the basket
It's a wonderful day in my muthafuckin neighborhood
A wonderful day in my goddamn neighborhood
Now rollin' tip-toe, incognito
Ichin' to serve a fool when my pump says so (Pump Pump)
Is another nigga with the D is plottin
And if you're fuckin with this nigga
You'll be spittin' out buck shots
So no pain no gain
Bakin soda free and they call me Kokane
Now I'mma fuck you up Kurupt
Cause I'mma bust trough your hood like the Schlitz Malt Liquor bull
Cause you gets no propers
Now your throwin' up the Pound
But I'm throwin' up the Black Mafia
Can't stop ya, what you wanna do?
Bring it on Snoop
And your whole fuckin' Puppy Pound crew
It's the nickel-slick nigga from Pomona
Not fake like lacers
But real like 'Tona's
Snoop Dogg you fuckin cold hopped it
Did most of the writing for Dre
And still you get your troops dropped
Now I see nigga's rich
But you was in the county washing master's shoes like a bitch
Now who's been sleepin' in my bed
Eatin' my funk, takin dope styles by the chunk
Cause I'mma funky to the finish
Cause your funk got a gang of B-12 in it

Outro (Kokane):

Yeah in case you didn't know
It's Black Mafia Life for life- fool
Above The muthafuckin' Law
UBU- what you wanna do
Black Hole of Watts
To my homies over there an shit
And to my funkinmuffin' Coconut
We clowns and ....yeah[Intro/Hook: X2]
People came in by the load
Encore, encore
People came in by the load
Ooh, when love is strong

[KM.G]
Yeah, y'all, I felt the need, I had to let you all know
How Above the Law flow, we keep that funky gangster ratio
Yeah, we're taking our time, cause patience is a virtue
Plus, we ain't in a hurry, to motherfucking hurt you
Peep, we checked in, date in 1989
Intertwined with some chips to sign
On the little dotted line, it was lovely and the Dineros was clean
Different from the crack money, but green was green
Fresh on the scene, niggas didn't know the time, we're enterprising
But never realising how the criming and the rhyming would twist
And make a hell of a mix
Had the neighborhood fiending like some junkies before a fix
Half of Cali' came to get with the source
They did after we down, players could have their own choice
Either rap singing, or even street singing
It didn't make a difference long as the funk you're bringing
Everybody's down with the Pimp Clinic
But all they wanted was a piece, piece of the streets
And we be all up in that ass with the quickness
The thickness, yeah, funking the set from here to the East
This is a player thing, this ain't no fucking bullshit
Because we pull shit
My name is KM.G, I'm from the Clinic and the Park
You either get glocked in the dark, or get sparked
Yeah, I had to change my wives, change my ways
Straight cut the strays and live for better days
Low ride and slide through the street
A real nigga ready to eat
Rolling tough with the Glock on my seat

[Hook]

[Cold 187Um]
Yeah, now I done travelled around the world and said a million rhymes
Like with N.W.A. back in '89
I put the C in the controversy in the industry
Like Eazy-E and Ice-T
Yo, I did thousands of shows, I dissed many faces
I deal with new jacks, on a way out basis
I put it down with the true crew
We're leaving player haters mesmerised when we trip through
[KM.G] How many suckers you know?
Well, I know a whole truck full
I'm trying to stay two steps ahead of that bullshit they're trying to pull
Motherfuckers claim they hard
And putting half to work, and did half the dirt
Ain't even from the turf
What I would do if I was you, is shut your fucking mouth
Cause we be moving keys while you're playing house
I'm the original, rap murderer
See, I can beat your ass, rock the Mic
Or fuck your girl on a good night
Cause from Pomona to S.C
I represent the real niggas that do the who-ride with me "Yeah"
Yo, on the real, I got skills like a fifth degree black belt
Plus, I'm ten times more explicit than the Sculpt
Niggas making schemes and gimmicks to sell LP's
Instead of being real and stacking G's
Yo, ugh, I'm like a fool at a house party
If I'm heated, I'm fucking it up for everybody
[KM.G] What's your name, nigga?
Awww, you don't know?
Yo, it's Mr. 187 with my dick all in your whore
Yeah, if she wanna encore
Yeah, She won't know, it won't more

[Hook: until fade][Intro: Cold 187Um]
OOOOh, wooww, wooww, stay away
OOOOh, wooww, awwoww, stay away

[Cold 187Um]
Now see, I be the one with more game than Deion
Cause in the Rap game nobody don't wanna
It's started way way back
When I was servin' motherfuckers on the side of the Shack
Infact, fools wanna try to see me daily
Whether be the.. shot caller, can't nobody fade me
The untouchable, irresistible, funkdafied
Boo Yaa, I'm smokin by the ton
I come from the depth of Cali, P-Town, West up!!
What's your waitin for, light it up
I represent the crew, with that Voo Doo
What you gonna do, when we come through for you?
You better come in peace not war
Cause you just don't know when we might have a straw
I'm a type of nigga smokin' straight from the bong
If it smells like a smoke, well, I just got my smoke on
And I'mma be high like 7-4-7 with my license plate
Sayin' much love for my homie
I probably in the back of the clubs
Spittin' game meditatin, and rollin' up much bud
So we can smoke like an Indian on the reservation
And make peace in the x generation
Cause that's the way it suppose to be
And if it's up to me, homie, I'mma smoke a whole tree
I know, a lot of you really can't relate
So just ride with me, cause it's a mind state

[Hook: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww

[PEE GEE]
The bass hit got my tipsy, like Hennessey
Now, tell me can you feel me?
I'm comin' strong like a soldier, I'm garanteed to hold ya
As I bust on Dojah
The snare hits me like a child with a grab bag
That's why you hooks surround my vocals like a Zig-Zag
Don't it? - I garantee you won't choke on it
I got the bomb, you got bomb, smoke and vote on it
Shit, the only time I feel gifted, is when I get lifted

[Cold 187Um ]
See, you can tell by the smoke at the 4th floor see
Cause it be Cold 187Um and the home Girl PEE GEE
And Km.G, rollin' up the pound
Yeah, we're stayin' down like P-Town
Yo, we roll deep when we creep on the back streets
We're checkin' player haters, we're havin' much heat
We're tryin' to keep it all real over here, man
You can't complain cause we all havin' things
You got to get up, get out and get his fates
And then maybe we all can relate, yeah

[Hook: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww

[Km.G]
Welcome to the world called the beautiful place
Where niggas just dope flyin, heavenly seditated
Where in the mindstate, when you feel bigger
A little bit stronger than the average nigga
Yeah, we rather co-operate the mood and stick
Maybe get the fly bitches to Re-up on the dick
Awww shit, yeah, you know what?
I hit my nigga Mr. K-Oss to bring the cut
Brush the strap, so we can chill smoke a hell of a sack
Straight Riders and Macks, bitches gettin' table dances in the back
Invited a whole car load, the hoodrats, they wanna get wet
And I ain't bein' nice tonight, I'm mothafuckin' get nasty
Ain't lettin' one fly bitch pass me
Ho's love it when I drop it, my pimps were screamin' nigga do it
House about dinner for two, four stars caviar
Pimp Clinic Cadillac rent-a-cars
My niggas smokin' chronic outta fat ass cigars
Straight chillin' at the bar

[Hook: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww

[Spanish female AD LIBS til fade][Verse 1]

[Cold 187um]
We for breakin' backs in the '94, time to play a ho
Like we never did befo'
Since the prices went up for a piece a ass
See, I still get freebies cause I got gap
And when it comes to the question
"What have you done for me lately?"
Yo, G, I make them bitches hate me

[KM.G]
So grab ya coat, grab ya hat, cause it's like that
Ya try and play the role and ain't nothin' but a hood rat
So don't front, yeah, your name's Terri not Halle
But you sprung like a motherfucker when I hit that berry
And let a ho know what's poppin'
Cause it comes with the territory when you come a jockey

[Hook: Kokane] (x4)
Everything will be alright

[Verse 2]

[KM.G]
Yeah I'm in the mood I need a ho with much aptitude
To creep wicked, to come kick it
With the P-I-M-P, pimp clinic number 1
Ya say I ain't shit but ya sprung
But ya holds the number then folds the number
Then ya crawls to my house for a late night slumber

[Cold 187um]
Yeah, cause bitches in the 90s ain't shit
They claim that they a lady, steady
Suckin' every other niggas dick
So now you at my house on my couch screamin' out
My name, my status and my motherfuckin clout
"And ya nigga don't know whats going on."
Cause he always broke and he always gone
Now people might say that I am scandalous
But it ain't my fault if a bitch can't handle this

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]

[Kokane]
Now I just had lit a flya show
I bumped up so I gotta spit at the ho
Yeah, she bound to let me smoke but make no mistake
I got a 8 year bid next day for a rape
Owww, actin' like crows
And ya wonder why we call ya bitches and skeezas and hoes

[Cold 187um]
Yeah, she shoulda used the fuckin' mace
Tryin' to come up on the homie cause the county check was late
Uh, thats the problem with you bitches nowadays
Since you drop a couple a babies think you kickin' it and gettin' paid
I waitin' for Mr. Timesalt
So he can pull yo fuckin' creep up and pay my fuckin' bills off

[Hook x4]

[Verse 4]

[Cold 187um]
I only speak of what I've been through best
Believe I've been around from the pimp clinic
Hip, keep ya veins in ya fuckin' mouth
Bitches used to treat me like a bowl of onion soup
Now they gettin' tossed on the hood of my Lexus Coupé
I keep clownin' as you hoes cause you boos
I got the hat, the nose and the motherfuckin' funny shoes

[KM.G]
I clown on the witness, I kick this
Bookers in my business know that I'm attracted to the bomb
And ya know the thing is ones around that like to play
And hit you up with that ass with no delay
Shit, I learned hoes like takin' off they clothes
When them 100 Dollar bills is on the flo', really doe

[Hook x8][Intro: KM.G whispering]
Ugh, in the house, check it out
Above the Law, ATL, player, tell me where you at hah?
Above the Law gang, A.T.L, where you at hah?
Pimp Clinic Gang, where you at hah?
Mad beats pumpin, where you at hah?
That's what they say do hah?

[Verse 1: KM.G]
Diggin' their groom when they gang beat into the room
Sippin' on thick Hennessey consume
Yeah, we're comin' through, ready to dance with the devil in the pale roomlight
Gays kind of mad cause bang kind of tight
See, that the feelin, how chill and bake a quater in the Westside
For a nigga to get fly, tricks on some hookin' let him steal a gram
Visit my whores to get sucked up
I'm the man, lookin' for this other mothafucker
Me and my game, he wanna get wicked
He wanna take it there, dumpin' browns any time I G-up
Yeah, I'll be the mothafucker, to straight see ya
So pass the letter to the mail, Hands Up!
I just got a fax at the Shack in my ride
And now, they sent me on my pager
Two chickens got stuck, someone's playin' with paper
All of a sudden, I had to sent the homie
The big homie, the pistol Whip, pistol whipped the whole clique
Because we didn't benefittin' game
Known Above the Law got to keep the name
Maintained, stayin' away from them One Times
Cause we're pistol grippers, and them turkey could be trippin'
Bad unique uniform
Plus, the NARCs come through like some mothafuckin' quite storm
All we have to do is stay more aware
I'm about to flow in the the studio, bump a whore and go
And stay strapped all the time
Put that L-neezie I'mma get rhyme, toss a gang of crimes
So now you know, what we go through, the evil shit that real men do

[Hook: various overvoices with somewhat scary music different than were in the verses]
Real men do
Evil that men do
Evil that real men do
Evil that men do
Evil that men do

[Verse 2: Cold 187Um]
Now, roll me up some of that good feelin'
So I can forget all the shit on the news that I'm hearin'
I got other things to do with my life
I give a fuck if OJ killed or didn't kill his wife
Cause I be around a million mothafuckers a day
Just ready to peel your cap back for lookin' the wrong way
I got that problem with myself, and my mind is playin' tricks on me
Am I gettin' fucked with my homies?
Or is my lady fuckin' everybody in the hood?
I hope not, because her pussy is good
Yo, I roll through with my Nino on lap cocked
Just for the suckers on the set that wanna cock block
They get dropped like that last player hater
I swear, I come raw like the jaws on the alligator
Now, all let your homies and all of your friends
Quit tryin' to put your buster ass back together again
But if not, I'm at your way, ready to shake you some more shit
If that's I did, the busy gotta get
Cause y'all peep, I was raised on the rough side, hussy
The Who-Ride, The either get rode on
I'm gettin' tired the mothafuckers playin' chef boyardee
Stirring me up, and tryin' to put salt all on me
I give them 50 feet, with the Infra Red on the tech set
Boo yaa, kill them with no regrets
I once knew a nigga named Sami, who had it goin' on in Miami
Now, Sami got popped by the Feds like a bitch, so we snitched on his whole fuckin' family
Now, who that? who that? who that, all up in the kool aid?
Who don't even know what the flavor look like
Yo, I be the C-O-L-D-187, A-B-O-V-E-T-H-E-L-A-W
It's the crew, wicked like Voo Doo
Yeah, with that evil that men do, fool

[Hook: various overvoices with somewhat scary music different than were in the verses]
Real men do
Evil that men do
Evil that real men do
Evil that men do
Evil that men do
