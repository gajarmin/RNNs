[Intro: Lay Law]
You've now entered the quest to, the black triangle
Now you know the reason for the Black Mafia theory, hahaha
Yes it has many meanings, but no matter how you define it
It still comes out black
See it's just a hair trim
So you can call it what you want

[2Pac]
Now I clown around, when I hang around with the Underground
But when I'm with the Mafia I'm droppin' you
And if you're a ho then I'll be knockin ya, baby why not
You shouldn't jock me cause I'm popular
The group with the Glock, I love to pop the gun
Coppers get shot, they shouldn't try to stop the Mafia
2Pac'll pack a person, pump the trunk
I'm bumpin G-Funk, but you can call it what you want
How many times I gotta tell ya, don't ignore me
Either be my ho or hit the do', you're nothin for me (see ya!)
That's why I love to go on tour G
Scores of whores behind the door, a nigga's known now, I'm sippin on a 40
So you can call it what you want just pass the blunt and kick it Money

[Money B]
Well, I am the danger, THE DANGER, similar to a killer
I rhyme for rounds of conflicts chomp and stomp em while y'all chillin
In Tokyo, check it as I choke a slow poke rapper
Capped his ass faster, than a half of pound of crepes'll go on Mother's Day
First and fifteenth, another way of sayin it
I got new clips so trip but it's OK to get your crew
Cause ooh I'll send your team to the showers
They true and do and rippin and got the Wonder Twin powers
I devour much venom, lunch breaks I shit em, I just stink
Whaddya think, this is a threat?
Just forget about a come back, you're done black
See Cutty was the stopper
But you'll call me the indo when I chop ya with the shopper
Sting ya with the stinger, flex the trigger finger
I blow you to bits and I be gettin a kick out of grabbin the mic and flingin
Lyrics with the maximum security crew
I smoke a spliff but I'm not Jamaican
So why don't you let a Yankee Doodle do what he has ta
Raise my hand and cast a
Hellafied spell you can't tell you better ask a
Weatherman he'll sigh and reply, "You shoulda stayed in the house"
Cause Mon is gonna rain on their parades

[Cold 187um]
Nowww, clear the smoke, and grab a fool by his throat
And don't let him go til he holla holla billygoat
Now Money Money Money B, once said to me
"187 why you wanna be a G?" Welllll..
I like to clock big G's, and hang out all night
And never worry bout a bitch, cause she can't tell me shit
Plus, money money is a pimp thang (what?)
Cause see if you was in my shoes, you'd be doin the same
So don't ever ever fuck, cause I'mma G and player hustler
Cause when I'm bustin on a mic I could never be a customer
Now peep this, cause when I'm goin deep
The only customers gettin served in the housssse, is the pussy I freak
They wanna pop that ying-yang
I tell em, "Sit down, shut up bitch, and let me kick game" (y'know)
Cause hoes always be sayin they got it goin on but if they wanna
Get with a nigga like me they gotta pay a fee, I am not
The No Mack Nigga, from the planet called Silk
I'm from the planet Black Mafia Life, that freaks pimps
Yo, come take a sip of the psycho-mega-
Pimpsome-hoesta-must-be-a-playa
Now hold up, wait a second (Background Girls)
Nah, I fucked you bitches on the last record, yo
It's like I'm high on a raggamuffin spliff
Me the dope sound what a man, the myth (come)
Mon they wanna see me fade shit, like I did last year
So I POST on em, then I COAST on em
No I never never never had a murder rap
And if you snitch you say I did it you're bound to get your neck snapped
So there it is, and how it's gonna be
So I pass the joint, to my man KM.G

[KM.G]
Well you can call it what you want but if you don't
I'm still a nigga with a pimp strut, ooh, a macadamia nut
I said what you want, I'm workin' for a you-ohh
Well alright, you little silly ass ho
Now when you wanna rendezvous and get tramped (get tramped)
Give a call to the clinic, ATL's the pimp camp
And see which playa, is up for the downstroke
(Cause you skeez-in, cause you broke)
So toast them hoes like I said before
I fuck four bitches a day, and I'm lookin for more
Cause cords of scores of hoes be leavin my house
Like, BAM, and I'm like, DAMN
Now my niggas done labelled me the dangerous neighborhood nasty man
Cause they know I can
When you wake up in the morning I only give ya five pushes
I'll be out by your garage, awaitin behind the bushes
Drinkin' coffee, smooth waitin to talk see
Like a true ho gigolo should be
See I'm a giant and the rest of them are fakers
Especially when it comes to the bitches and they moneymakers
A simp nigga hesitate to diss you tramp but I don't
So here's the Black Mafia so, you can call it what you want

[Hook: Cold 187Um]
Ooh, you can call it what you want
Well, you can call it what you want

Well, you can call it what you want

Each time I see her the feeling gets stronger
We sit a bit closer and stare a lot longer, huh
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Went to mutter I stuttered cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win
Cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, I'm falling for his girlfriend
It's like a trap that I'm sinking in to
I wake up sweating when I'm sleeping cause I'm thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
Trying to shake it but the feeling comes right back
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep calling me saying to come over
What do I do, you make it hard for me to chose .. what I won't do for Love

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit, and pray hoping the beatings will go away
It wasn't always a hit, and run relationship
It used to be Love happiness, and companionship
Way back when he treated you good
Moved you up to the hills out the ill's of the ghetto hood
You felt as though you owed him your life
It felt right so you said yes now your really his wife
He got you pregnant but the baby just wouldn't live
Something she couldn't give so things got negative
But that's when a stranger came through
And he's pestering you about the things you couldn't do
You say your happy at home right
But that's just a lie, as you cry through a long night
Until I came to rescue you, making you chose ... what you won't do for Love

[Outro: 2Pac]
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, in the house, what you won't do for Love
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, what you won't do

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Tell me why O.P.D. sweatin' me
Is it for the major crip that I'm makin'
Is it for the fact that Pac don't be fakin'
Think before you talk black
I ain't the one to bite my tongue, 2pacalypse will smoke back
And I don't need a posse, my Glocks like a pocket full of rockies
Takin' out the cop team
Don't mock me, sucka just jock me
Send me to the first that can drop me
Better talk it like we walk it when we swing em
Yea little square we can sling em
Got a posse you can bring em
Watch me
Pop, pop, bang, boom, ping em
Big D's in the house, pass the crazy
Of course cause them suckaz can't fade me...yea

[Chorus]
Yea, yea 2Pac Shakur, thug life, outlaw
Kill a nigga kill a nigga (strictly representing)
Come on, break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)

[Dub C]
Now make a make a way here I come with a clip
Dub C and they got me on some freestyle type shit huh
So nigga go and run hard as you can and take cover
Mad circle mutalate motherfuckers
And I can't stand them niggas in platoes?
Fuck a dancer, I'm hoopin' cuz my crew don't dance
Khakis and them steel toe boots is how we roll
Madder than a serial killer on a ho stroll
And I don't know about y'all but im down to rep
Packin' all these niggas who be dissin' the underground
Motherfuck god, I diss em on wax
Catch em slippin' backstage start fadin' they ass
Oops there goes that ghetto mentality
The same reason you never see my video on your T.V
Cuz we don't say what they want us to say
Fuck rhythm and blues and the police too fool
You niggas can't stop me if i gave ya a free steel to the jaw you still couldn't drop me
So don't try to sneak on that creep tip
Cuz you'll get that ass kicked quick bitch
So go in the house y'all here comes that crazy nigga flippin' on the mailman and innocent bystanders
Suckers will get knocked down
Dub C bringin' noise from the mother fuckin' underground

[Chorus]
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on, break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga
Come on break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)

[Money B]
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Wicked Money B, I am that odical dodge
(Who's bad?)
I'm the worst-est wicked as I wanna be
Stand if you want to, but don't you dare stand in front of me
Daddy mack trickin', what you did all fuckin' shit up
Well here's a little more dick for you to suck
All these years that I be rappin'
Styles that I'll be flashin'
Kind of like Nike, I never have to ask questions
All it takes is a place, and a place and a time and a rhyme
If I find ya, you'll be hidin' in my face
I'll be on it like a honey
Stingin' like a bumble
I been drunk with this funky attitude
Fuck the humble
Got this stamina to be on the mic
Mashin' in the stance with the stylist boots
I'm a bout to catch a bulge in my pants
And the bigger the butt, the bigger the nut
That I mistrust
I can catch a bum rush
Layin' in the cut, like a panther on the prowl
So agile
Don't ask scoop
You're not a now
But I don't know how we should
Take ya time, take ya take ya time
Sees you get funky before you start the rhyme
Yes
Take ya time, take ya take ya time
Sees you get funky before you start the rhyme
So all you filthy MicNasties, rappin to fast
Ask me, I say slow down fore I roll that ass
Peace to Down W, Big D, 2pac, and Mack
Sideways to your mommas house

[Chorus]
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on, break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga
Come on break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)

[Deb-E]
I give a nigga no respect
For he plays me
Come off that bullshit fool uou can fade me
Spare me the comedy cuz you get no props
And if you think I'm fuckin' around hear the gun pop
Gotta break your ass off some of that reality
Niggas don't know about the D to the E to the B
So I start kickin' the funky ass sick for money shit
The shit on the microphone motherfuckers can't fuck with
You want something to play with?
Warm your ass like gum
As I push in the clip pump pump
From a woman's perspective
Live from the motherland here's my objective
Let this microphone pump
As I pump and stomp
To make a fly guy shake the rump
Never fake too much
Money B and W.C. the D.E.B down with the motherfuckin S.T[Intro: Lay Law]

Takin' out the cop team
Don't mock me, sucka just jock me
Send me to the first that can drop me
Better talk it like we walk it when we swing em
Yea little square we can sling em
Got a posse you can bring em
Watch me
Pop, pop, bang, boom, ping em
Big D's in the house, pass the crazy
Of course cause them suckaz can't fade me...yea

[Chorus]
Yea, yea 2Pac Shakur, thug life, outlaw
Kill a nigga kill a nigga (strictly representing)
Come on, break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)

[Dub C]
Now make a make a way here I come with a clip
Dub C and they got me on some freestyle type shit huh
So nigga go and run hard as you can and take cover
Mad circle mutalate motherfuckers
And I can't stand them niggas in platoes?
Fuck a dancer, I'm hoopin' cuz my crew don't dance
Khakis and them steel toe boots is how we roll
Madder than a serial killer on a ho stroll
And I don't know about y'all but im down to rep
Packin' all these niggas who be dissin' the underground
Motherfuck god, I diss em on wax
Catch em slippin' backstage start fadin' they ass
Oops there goes that ghetto mentality
The same reason you never see my video on your T.V
Cuz we don't say what they want us to say
Fuck rhythm and blues and the police too fool
You niggas can't stop me if i gave ya a free steel to the jaw you still couldn't drop me
So don't try to sneak on that creep tip
Cuz you'll get that ass kicked quick bitch
So go in the house y'all here comes that crazy nigga flippin' on the mailman and innocent bystanders
Suckers will get knocked down
Dub C bringin' noise from the mother fuckin' underground

[Chorus]
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on, break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga
Come on break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)

[Money B]
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Wicked Money B, I am that odical dodge
(Who's bad?)
I'm the worst-est wicked as I wanna be
Stand if you want to, but don't you dare stand in front of me
Daddy mack trickin', what you did all fuckin' shit up
Well here's a little more dick for you to suck
All these years that I be rappin'
Styles that I'll be flashin'
Kind of like Nike, I never have to ask questions
All it takes is a place, and a place and a time and a rhyme
If I find ya, you'll be hidin' in my face
I'll be on it like a honey
Stingin' like a bumble
I been drunk with this funky attitude
Fuck the humble
Got this stamina to be on the mic
Mashin' in the stance with the stylist boots
I'm a bout to catch a bulge in my pants
And the bigger the butt, the bigger the nut
That I mistrust
I can catch a bum rush
Layin' in the cut, like a panther on the prowl
So agile
Don't ask scoop
You're not a now
But I don't know how we should
Take ya time, take ya take ya time
Sees you get funky before you start the rhyme
Yes
Take ya time, take ya take ya time
Sees you get funky before you start the rhyme
So all you filthy MicNasties, rappin to fast
Ask me, I say slow down fore I roll that ass
Peace to Down W, Big D, 2pac, and Mack
Sideways to your mommas house

[Chorus]
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on, break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga
Come on break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)

[Deb-E]
I give a nigga no respect
For he plays me
Come off that bullshit fool uou can fade me
Spare me the comedy cuz you get no props
And if you think I'm fuckin' around hear the gun pop
Gotta break your ass off some of that reality
Niggas don't know about the D to the E to the B
So I start kickin' the funky ass sick for money shit
The shit on the microphone motherfuckers can't fuck with
You want something to play with?
Warm your ass like gum
As I push in the clip pump pump
From a woman's perspective
Live from the motherland here's my objective
Let this microphone pump
As I pump and stomp
To make a fly guy shake the rump
Never fake too much
Money B and W.C. the D.E.B down with the motherfuckin S.T(feat. Clee, Numskull)

[Numskull, Money B & Clee]
Is this my party or yours, my time or yours
My drank or yours, my place or yours
Can you drive? Naw, I'll drive
I don't lie, you lie
I even tell the truth when I lie
Now gimme some head, cause its the last time
You'll ever see a nigga like me
I'm on some fuckin and flee
You only hate cause you lovin to eat
You heard 2Pac tape, and now you thuggin wit three
Bankrupt, hoodrats, and now they lovin some me

[Money B]
Say bitch do me a favor
Go get your boy a bat, and two shots of yay (alright)
I'm thinkin you my flava, I'm bout to put you on my hip
Let you vibrate my shit like a pager
That ass is lookin major
Do you fuck on the first date?
Well lets skate like Armor Yaga
They say the best pussy is new pussy
You even true pussy
I turned you into crew pussy

[Clee]
Now look at this bitch, she bout a eight or a nine
But a eight next to Clee, gon make her a dime
I just met the bitch, and she want me to make her mine
But I'm like bitch, grab a ticket, get a number, wait in line
And haters find me to be they worst nightmare
Cause I have they bitch cleanin house in they nightware
They be like, where in the fuck is my bitch at?
She proably blowin me back, while she blowin ya scratch

[Chorus]
Put Cha thang on me
I'm tryna drink, fuck, nut and get up
You got your name on me
I see you lookin right, but what yo cash lookin like
Put cha thang on me
You say you wanna make it hot, well lets shake the spot
You got your name on me
Bitch we ain't trippin on ya
We from Oakland, California!

[Money B]
I'm drinkin hard liqour, the results come quicker

Fuck that, you got the plush cat, whats that?
Bend over, and lemme touch that(whats that?)
A freckled face nutstasche
Make em take they knee like a touchback
And grab a hold to my nutsack, and lemme bust that

[Numskull]
I'm proably the dopest nigga that the earth ever made
I'm fine, I'm long, got game, and I'm paid
Nigga I can pull a bitch in a mail man suit
Leavin checks to checks, scopin in my steel toe boots
Now, watch what I tell ya, i'ma pull Lil Kim
Cause she done got some shit fixed
Now she holdin her ten
From here, its fair game, fuckin everybodys bitch
Payroll on mine, I ain't turnin down shit

[Clee]
Well heres a little somethin about a nigga like Clee
Nigga been a playa since elementary
And I'ma stay a playa till the next century
Got the ???sayin, wow bitch its Clee
Let a bitch hit to me, I'm the one she wanna leave wit
I'ma have that bitch, playboy, please believe it
We run game on em, then we run trains on em
Its even to the point when they put our names on em

[Chorus](Numskull, Money B & Clee)
Is this my party or yours, my time or yours
My drank or yours, my place or yours
Can you drive? Naw, I'll drive
I don't lie, you lie
I even tell the truth when I lie
Now gimme some head, cause its the last time
