[Chris Brown]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Drake]
What you mean I ain’t call you? I hit you when I landed
I’m waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguing more and it’s getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she’ll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I’ll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I’m willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you’ll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It’s useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind, again, again. and deuces I must throw ya peace

[Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I’mma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
I’m stupid but I won’t get my drama on
What I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talking 'bout

[Fabolous]
According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shits? you ain't gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better you’d do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Chris Brown]
So you gonna diss me even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gonna

[Drake]
(miss me a little when I’m gone)

[Fabolous]
Drizzy voice, now I’m ghost baby
Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I’m bout my business boys, plus I make paper
Come on that's old news, yesterday’s paper
Oh, you talking, what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth
You’ll never score another me, I’ll shut it out
Act like there’s gum in your hair girl, cut it out

[Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag #red Louis belt
How can you love me baby, first you gotta love yourself

[Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if I was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop making sad songs

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her; to her[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Hook]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna
Say bye bye
Say bye bye
Say bye bye to her
You made me wanna
Say bye bye
Say bye bye
Say bye bye to her

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, used to be valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care, but I ain't get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we're both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club
I rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don’t never feel like we vibin'
Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you tripping for?
I don’t wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think its better if I let you know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I’m a dick, so it shouldn’t be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complain
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Probably didn’t register, don’t trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick
She give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don’t care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

[Hook][Intro]
Faire l'amour lendemain

[Verse 1]
What if the sky was turning red?
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed, laying face to face
Oh girl, I love the way you sound when you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out, show you how it's gon' be
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
The world can't end until we finish
Girl we gon'

[Chorus]
And we gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down

[Verse 2]
All these vibrations from your legs, massaging my back
I got your body shivering cause we're covered in sweat
And girl I like the way it opens up, when you throw it back babe
Girl it might be too much, oh babe if you keep doing that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby can you make it disappear?
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Do it like we only got one, baby let's pretend we only got one night
One last time, let me take my time and do it to you right
Buildings and bridges maybe falling down, but that won't stop me from turning that thing around, girl yeah
Won't you come on over and we can treat it like it's the motherfucking end of the world?

[Chorus]
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down

[Outro]
A nigga going hard in the paint, you think I can?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can?
Going for miles, no stops, a nigga going hard in the paint
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Take it off, I wanna love you
And everybody, wanna touch you
You moving right, wanna see what's up under
You back it up, beep beep like a trucker
Nice thighs, nice waist
And you know I can't forget about your face
But don't none of that matter
I'm about to make your pockets fatter

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl I just wanna see you strip right now cause it's late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip
Girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip
God damn you sexy, for me
God damn you sexy, baby
God damn you sexy
Girl, I just wanna see you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Got my shades on, with my Jays on
In the club with a pocket full of ones
This girl booty outta control
There she go, up and down the pole
Which one I'mma take home? Get my freak on
If you ain't freaking we ain't speaking
Think I'm playing? No I'm not
Let me see you back it up and drop
Yeah, I wanna see your legs in the air
Baby don't worry about your hair
All those tracks
I don't give a damn 'bout that
In the club and they playing my song
Turn it up, play it all night long
If you think you can and you know you can
I'mma give you all this money, money, money

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Pants, shirt, you could take it off
Panties, bra, you could take it off
Red-bottom heels, you could take 'em, wait, wait
Leave 'em on cause I like my women tall
Got a hot mama, you're hotter than a sauna
I want to peel them clothes off your body like a banana
The only reason I dress you in that designer
Is to get you out that Dolce & Gabanna
I throw this money up, she watch it all fall
Toot that thang up, pop it for a boss
Anything you wanting baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name, now they call you Mrs. McCall

[Chorus][Intro: Chris Brown]
This right here's for the niggas that been hated on
This shit right here (2x)
This right here

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
He's saying he's your best friend
And he's always the one in your ear
I know that he been waiting
To get my ass up out of here
It's been a couple months now
Baby I am not suprised
But I'm a real nigga
Girl, how you gonna take his side?

[Hook]
I bet if I lick that spot then you won't act like that
I miss giving you them backshots
Girl, you remember that?
Baby and I'd be damned if I let him take my place
Don't listen to what that nigga say
Cus' he's just saying you could do better
And baby all I'm saying is he sound like a hater
And baby he could just fuck off and do us a favor
Mind your business, nigga stop being a hater

[Bridge: Seven]
Here we go, why these niggas keep hating for
Guess that's just the way it goes
Uh oh, that's the way it goes
Uh oh, that's the way it goes

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby what the hell are you thinking
By the way you screaming at me
Thinking you’ve been drinking
I know that nigga's on your line
But he can't get what's mine, yeah
Baby you need to show me what the hell I did wrong
I need you to hold me, right here in your arms
I'm kissing your heart and all your little body parts

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
See it's a reason why she still with me
And she ain't with you
She see the real in me, and the bitch in you
Yeah, she friends with you, but she sexting me
When she textin you, she be next to me
Showin me how weak you is, it's embarrassing
I'm a real nigga so I guess you are a mannequin
Bad on the phone but in person you be panicking
I ain't even stressed, got a bag full of cannabis
I ain't with the bull so this ain't beef
You a weenie I bet you be lying on your meat
If real recognize real, who the fuck's you
She need a principal, not a substitute

[Outro: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
He's just saying you could do better
Girl stop playing he could never
Be the one you need cus you're the one for me girl
I know how to please you right
He's just saying you could do better
Girl stop playing he could never
Be the one you need cus you're the one for me, yeah
But I'm a real nigga[Intro: DJ Drama]
We thinking like 36, 24, 40
That's about right

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Judy got a booty from here to there
Make a nigga smile from ear to ear
Order three more bottles of that Belvedere
Then I point it out like you come here
You come here and you come here
Booty sitting higher than a flight of stairs
Some can make it clap, some really can't know
Them Alabama girls said it's all in the ankles
Speaking of ankles bend over and touch your toes
Pop it and make it roll I'm loving this angle
Ha, I love this view that I'm looking at
Dress so elegant, ass like an elephant
Shorty got me hotter than I've ever been
So I'mma give it to like a motherfucking veteran
Body so sick so this dick be the medicine
And I don't know her name, she told me but all I heard was
(Clap Sound FX)

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy)
And the way she move her body is amazing (amazing)
Yeah, she got me going insane
And I don't even really know her name, I just call her
Big booty Judy (aye) [x7]
Big big booty Judy

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Now, now, now Judy is her name, I beat it out of frame
I'm messing with no busters or no suckers cause they lame
She drop it low and sit it up, other niggas freezing up
Cause when they see that ass they like "Damn what you feeding her?"
Her, her, her body so ridiculous, I kiss it where she ticklish
Big booty world record, you can find it up in Guinness
And no, no, no it's not a gimmick, shawty she the truth
And she got a big donk (big donk), alley-oop
Damn girl I'm horny and you know I want it
Booty so big I can put ten bottles on it
I tell her hold this, she got baby making hips
So I pulled her pants down and gave her lingerie a kiss
Miss Parker, Miss Parker
When you go let me (oh), Miss Parker?
She whispered in my ear "Right now"
Then me, her, and her booty all smile

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I know this cutie, her name is Judy
She's a yellow bone, big chick mega booty
Shawty got a donk, booty superpunk
And she keep it keep it shaking, like a bass in the trunk
Well six fifteens, his swag so mean
And I wanna know how she get up in them jeans
She gon' be my baby mama, she is all me
She's a bad bitch, greet her "Hello, Barbie"

[Chorus][Intro - Bow Wow]
Hey Chris. Hey man
You know it's been a long time you know since we hooked up and did something, real, you know
For the ladies, ya dig that
Oh yeah! You know we! You know we! You know we do it for the ladies!

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
You got the wrong one if you think I ain't goin' out
You used to be the only girl a nigga would think about
I got a couple of girls on call; I'mma a bring em out
A Magic City stripper, huh, so this what this all about?
I'm in the club doing my two step
I pulled about eight broads already, I'm just getting my feet wet
But I ain't even knocking your style
Cause I be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow
Oooh, see you on the blogs with your dude and all that
But little do you know, you making yourself look bad
If dude got a problem, better tell him to fall back
I'm blowing real big in VIP, yeah that loud pack
See it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better get your girl because your bitch in here
Tryna see how many I can fit in my Lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like Rambo, Bow!

[Hook - Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turned up
I ain't gon' think about you (na na na na)
(I said girl I ain't trippin', tonight I' goin' out with my niggas)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)
(I said girl I ain't trippin', tonight I' goin' out with my niggas)

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown]
We don' been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
You callin' me a player, but a nigga ain't trippin'
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My Blackberry's filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
You don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like
But I'm a do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty one
All the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me

[Hook]

[Bridge - Bow Wow]
I told her, I said, 'Girl I ain't trippin
Tonight I'm goin out with my niggas' (my niggas)
Hey (hey), I said, 'Girl I ain't trippin
Tonight I'm goin out with my niggas man'

[Verse 3 - Bow Wow]
I'm bein' honest, listen shawty, I don't want you no more
So leave the keys to the Benz 'fore you hit the front door
Cause you losin', and she choosin'
And like Chris said I'm chunkin' up the deuces
On to the next one. All I ask is keep it real
Couldn't do that; so I'mma tell you how I feel
I'm poppin' bottles all night
Cause that black card ain't got no limit alright

[Hook][Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Beats I be serving, sex beefs splurging
Diamonds got so many cuts, call my jeweller the surgeon
Ain't nobody fucking with me, label me the virgin
I'm hot burning, like when you leave a perm in
Everywhere I go these hoes be digging in they purses for a Sharpie
Cause they tryna get the autograph in cursive
Little bit of Coke mixed with a lot of bourbon
Got your boy leaning, sorry if my words slurring
Swerving in that DB9 on purpose
The roof disappear, call it magic like Earvin Johnson
Get up off my johnson, no more riding dick
Shawty this ain't magic mountain
I've been killing, killing every song that I been spitting on
And if I ain't spitting, better something that I written on
Can't even say it was a long road getting on
Only took a year and a half and now I'm shitting on

[Chorus]
Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it
Money to the ceiling, bitch I'm in the building
I'm a giant in the room full of midgets, tell her
Money talks so don't say nothing unless you talking business
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go
100%, I go 100%, I go

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
Lemme count this money, one million, two million
Put this up for my new car, save that for my baby momma and all you bums can keep the change

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah, I got them bullet proof Ray Bans so haters never in my head
Money hungry good for me, yeah I call it wheat bread
Ladies say I'm long stroking, yeah that’s what she said
Crib like a castle so I'm fucking on that king spread
Haha, big balling, fuck a loft
And money turn me on so I had to fuck it off
Skinny ass niggers pockets looking so bulimic
And I never spill my drink, you can call me Tempur-Pedic
Allergic to the haters, addicted to the money
You watching while I'm laughing cause all of you niggas funny
And they call me Action Jackson cause every day I'm stunting
And I'm writing hit songs like it's nothing
So nigga you bugging, fronting, what you think this is ho?
Paparazzi tryna pop me everywhere that Chris go
Never been no sucker no lame mad nigger
And your flow is more watered down than a drain ass nigga

[Chorus][Intro: Chris Brown]
Welcome to the cypher
Myself, K-mac, Ace Hood, Tyga
It's the cypher, let's go

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Moment of silence for this beat that I'm about to kill
And all you rappers signed a suicidal deal
No hard feelings pimpin', it's what authentic is
Month old denims thirty grand in the steel
Sleepin' on me I put gas in your Nyquil
Gettin' money while your pockets on the diet pill
Flow knock 'em cold out like Benadryl
Glock cold fourteen, call it Emmett Till
Yea, billionaire it's a state of mind
Thats the rollie on thankful for these good times
Michael Corleone back when he was in his prime
Thats how I'm feelin' while I'm fuckin' my new Spanish dime
Damn, and you can tell I'm on another level
He think he better then I? He get the J letter
Yeah jumped in jack be a trend setter
You lookin' at the best how you doin', it's a pleasure

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
I'm at the top like high note
Killin' for survival
Jeffery Dahmer - I'mma slaughter every beat that I'm on
Ya'll was sleepin' on me so I had to turn the lights on
My pockets swollen, I should put some ice on it
Shout to Breezy coulda never did this shit alone
Like potty training, coulda never did this shit alone
If we ain't the best to do this, then this shit was wrong
Sicker than HIV I guess that means I'm full-blown
And of course I'm speaking metaphorically
Livin' Fantastic I wonder if there's Four of me
This is just a sample so if you want more of me
You have to rewind time unless the microphone recordin' me
K-Mac rhymin' on the payback, the truth will set you free so I'mma testify and say that
Ballin' like a preacher catch me rollin' in my Maybach
Shinin' cause I blew myself up, Arab

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Look at me now, my dogs said we gon' be rich one day
But I'm Anfernee, I did things the Hardaway
Easy Bake, fast cake, Rearrange your vertebra
Try like a murder case, you gon' need ice gates
Thin ice, I be icier than a winter lake
Oh you, copied my swag, well you a little late
Prolly make more when I'm gone, Mike J
Smooth Criminal, sweet bass I call it Shawtay
Why you starin' so long, what your eyes gay
Money talk so I just walk and let it translate
You ain't fuckin' with me I don't fornicate
I just let her taste-test than I let my kids chase
Young Money Cash Money dollars, big face
So when you talk new rappers don't compare me
I'mma last king we don't talk rappers if it ain't YMCMB

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
They said I was down for the count let's make them eat they words
And if it's beef well sweet I make them bite the curb
This probation got me walkin' on the straight and narrow
I'm takin' shots in the club just likes it's double barrel
Come on live through what I been through
This media so fucked up that's why I don't do interviews
And I ain't gotta break shit but I bend the rules
Skateboard kick-flip right in my pool
With two hundred model chicks super gettin' loose
They just wanna big dick did I say that, Opps
Ha, oh my, oh my where's my manners
Pardon me for this grammar, this Virginia country grammar
Going nuts like some Planter's, and my chain feel like an anchor
When I told you to use your head but I ain't want you to be no thinker
Fresher than a mothafucka yeah you got yo stank up
Yeah swallow your pride, yeah go head and drank up[Intro]
Faire l'amour lendemain

[Verse 1]
What if the sky was turning red?
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed, laying face to face
Oh girl, I love the way you sound when you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out, show you how it's gon' be
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
The world can't end until we finish
Girl we gon'

[Chorus]
And we gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down

[Verse 2]
All these vibrations from your legs, massaging my back
I got your body shivering cause we're covered in sweat
And girl I like the way it opens up, when you throw it back babe
Girl it might be too much, oh babe if you keep doing that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby can you make it disappear?
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Do it like we only got one, baby let's pretend we only got one night
One last time, let me take my time and do it to you right
Buildings and bridges maybe falling down, but that won't stop me from turning that thing around, girl yeah
Won't you come on over and we can treat it like it's the motherfucking end of the world?

[Chorus]
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down

I'm on my grind like that skater named Terry
Kennedy my enemies
No death never scare me
Death where is thy sting
Grave where is thy victory
They don't remember your reveal look at history
But I'm gonna make sure these niggas remember me
Start a family legacy
For everyone that's kin to me
See I'm a paint a portrait so vividly
Even if you got Alzheimer's ain't no forgettin me

You won't break me tonight, no tonight, not tonight

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
You got the wrong one if you think I ain't goin' out
You used to be the only girl a nigga would think about
I got a couple of girls on call; I'mma a bring em out
A Magic City stripper, huh, so this what this all about?
I'm in the club doing my two step
I pulled about eight broads already, I'm just getting my feet wet
But I ain't even knocking your style
Cause I be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow
Oooh, see you on the blogs with your dude and all that
But little do you know, you making yourself look bad
If dude got a problem, better tell him to fall back
I'm blowing real big in VIP, yeah that loud pack
See it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better get your girl because your bitch in here
Tryna see how many I can fit in my Lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like Rambo, Bow!

[Hook - Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turned up
I ain't gon' think about you (na na na na)
(I said girl I ain't trippin', tonight I' goin' out with my niggas)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)
(I said girl I ain't trippin', tonight I' goin' out with my niggas)

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown]
We don' been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
You callin' me a player, but a nigga ain't trippin'
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My Blackberry's filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
You don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like
But I'm a do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty one
All the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me

[Hook]

[Bridge - Bow Wow]
I told her, I said, 'Girl I ain't trippin
Tonight I'm goin out with my niggas' (my niggas)
Hey (hey), I said, 'Girl I ain't trippin
Tonight I'm goin out with my niggas man'

[Verse 3 - Bow Wow]
I'm bein' honest, listen shawty, I don't want you no more
So leave the keys to the Benz 'fore you hit the front door
Cause you losin', and she choosin'
And like Chris said I'm chunkin' up the deuces
On to the next one. All I ask is keep it real
Couldn't do that; so I'mma tell you how I feel
I'm poppin' bottles all night
Cause that black card ain't got no limit alright

[Hook][Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Your body is a blessing, ain't no second guessing
And got no competition cause shawty you the bestest
Ain't no hesitation, tryna get you naked
You got something I wanna see

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Your clothes look good but they look great on the floor
So hurry up and take 'em off
Don't act like we ain't did this before
So baby let's go and bring your body over here

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

Going down south baby

[Hook]

I know that you can't wait til I lay you down
But waiting is the best part oh na na
Anticipation oh na na
Anticipation oh yeah[Hook: Kevin McCall]
Balling like a bitch, you can't tell me nothing cause I'm balling like a bitch
Filthy ass rich, swimming in this money cause I'm balling like a, balling like a
Balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch
Filthy ass rich, swimming in this money cause I'm balling like a, balling like a

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Look, BBC hat clean diamond snap hook
Take a picture with it like it's my last look
Gold Mac Book, cost 100 G's
I don't fuck with rats, I throw away the cheese
I'm balling baby, you see this nigga shine
I'm running shit, finish line
K-Mac cook that beat, I eat it like it's dinner time
Awards show gimme mine, loud and clear, intercom
Listen up, I show you how to stunt
Pocket full of money, you should see what's in the trunk
That bass got that bump, that shit that make you jump
Balling like a bitch, throw it up, slam dunk
V-neck like a quedo, rolling dice in the casino
Three bad chicks rolling trips, Cee-Lo
What's done is done, ain't no coming back
I'm balling like a bitch, roger that, it's Breezy baby

[Hook: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Balling like a bitch, you can't tell me nothing cause I'm balling like a bitch
Filthy ass rich, swimming in this money cause I'm balling like a, balling like a
I'm balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, watch me do my shit
Cause I'm balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, watch me take some shit

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, snap back, nigga back up in this bitch
Throwing by the 100/s watching strippers do the splits
Go on hit that flex, I ain't tripping on the bitches
Probably, 1 out of a 10 in California, I ain't hit
Bitch, I'm raw smell that shit
Hold our jaw up in your lips
Get a silly straw, have a sip
Motherfucking Tyga, she ain't met me then she lying
I pull that rocker out nigga, David and Goliath
Melt your fucking face boy, like that nigga on the Wire
Them niggas washed up, need a dry, dry 'em
Free my brother Weezy, now we back up on your TV
I'm rolling at 250, speeding me my nigga Breezy
Right behind me, Range Rove, T-Rell
Bunch a bad bitches tongue tied and bitches, what it do?
It's Young Money 'til the death bed
If anything, we the best and it's probably this

[Hook]Welcome to the cypher!
Myself, K-Mac, Ace Hood and the Tyger
Let's go

[Ace Hood]
Moment of silence for this beat that I'm about to kill
And all you rappers signed a suicidal deal
No hard feelings, pimpin, this what authentic is
Month old denim, 30 grand in it still
Sleeping on me? I put gas in your Nyquil
Getting money while your pockets on the diet pill
Flow knock em cold, out like Benadryl
Colt 14, call it Emmett Till
Yeah, billionaire is a state of mind
That's the rolley on, think before these good times
Micheal Corleone back while he was in his prime
That's how I'm feeling while I'm freaking my new Spanish dime
Damn! You can tell I'm on another level
He think he better then I he get the J letter
Yeah jumped and Jacked, be a trend-setter
You lookin at the best, how you doin? it's a pleasure

[Kevin McCall]
I'm at the top like high note
Killing for survival
Jeffrey Dahmer, I'mma slaughter every beat that I'm on
Y'all sleeping on me so I had to turn the lights on
My pockets swollen: I should put some ice on
Shout out to Breezy could've never did this shit alone
Potty traning couldn't never did this shit alone
If we ain't the best to do it, then prove us wrong
Flow sicker than HIV, I guess that mean I'm full-blown
Of course I'm just speaking metaphorically
Living fantastic, I wonder if there's four of me
This is just a sample: if you want more of me
You have to rewind time unless the microphone recording me
K-Mac rhyming on the Pay Back
The truth will sit you free so I will testify and say that
Ballin like a preacher, catch me rollin in my Maybach
Shining cause I blew myself up: Arab

[Tyga]
Look at me now, my dogg said that we will be rich one day
But I'm Anthony: I do things the Hardaway
Easy bake fast cake, rearrange her vertebrae
Try it like a murder case
You gon need ice skates, thin ice, ivy
I see her in the winter
Oh you clocking my swag? Well you a little late
Prolly make more when I'm gone, Mike J, smooth criminal
Smooth bass, I call it Sade
Why you starin so long? Is your eyes gay?
Money talk so I jus walk and let it translate
You ain't fuckin with me I don't fornicate
I just let her taste test then she let my dick chase
Young money cash money, dollars big face
So when you talkin new rappers don't compare me
Haha, I'mma last king, we don't talk rappers if it ain't YMCMB

[Chris Brown]
Look, said I was down for the count
Lets make em eat their words
And if this beat is sweet I make em bite the curb
This probation got me walkin the straight and narrow
I'm taking shots in the club jus like its double barrel
C'mon live thru what I've been thru
This media so fucked up thats why I don't do no interviews
And I ain't gotta break shit but I bend the rules
I skateboard, kick flip, right in my pool
With 200 model chicks super gettin loose
They jus want a big dick, did I say that? oops
Oh I, oh my where's my manners
Pardon me for this grammar
This Virginia country grammar
Going nuts like some planters, man my chain feel like an anchor
When I told you to use yo head I ain't want you to be no thinker
Fresher than a muthafucka yea you got yo stank up
Yeaa swallow yo pride, go ahead an drank up

Shame on you[Intro: DJ Drama]
We thinking like 36, 24, 40
That's about right

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Judy got a booty from here to there
Make a nigga smile from ear to ear
Order three more bottles of that Belvedere
Then I point it out like you come here
You come here and you come here
Booty sitting higher than a flight of stairs
Some can make it clap, some really can't know
Them Alabama girls said it's all in the ankles
Speaking of ankles bend over and touch your toes
Pop it and make it roll I'm loving this angle
Ha, I love this view that I'm looking at
Dress so elegant, ass like an elephant
Shorty got me hotter than I've ever been
So I'mma give it to like a motherfucking veteran
Body so sick so this dick be the medicine
And I don't know her name, she told me but all I heard was
(Clap Sound FX)

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy)
And the way she move her body is amazing (amazing)
Yeah, she got me going insane
And I don't even really know her name, I just call her
Big booty Judy (aye) [x7]
Big big booty Judy

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Now, now, now Judy is her name, I beat it out of frame
I'm messing with no busters or no suckers cause they lame
She drop it low and sit it up, other niggas freezing up
Cause when they see that ass they like "Damn what you feeding her?"
Her, her, her body so ridiculous, I kiss it where she ticklish
Big booty world record, you can find it up in Guinness
And no, no, no it's not a gimmick, shawty she the truth
And she got a big donk (big donk), alley-oop
Damn girl I'm horny and you know I want it
Booty so big I can put ten bottles on it
I tell her hold this, she got baby making hips
So I pulled her pants down and gave her lingerie a kiss
Miss Parker, Miss Parker
When you go let me (oh), Miss Parker?
She whispered in my ear "Right now"
Then me, her, and her booty all smile

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I know this cutie, her name is Judy
She's a yellow bone, big chick mega booty
Shawty got a donk, booty superpunk
And she keep it keep it shaking, like a bass in the trunk
Well six fifteens, his swag so mean
And I wanna know how she get up in them jeans
She gon' be my baby mama, she is all me
She's a bad bitch, greet her "Hello, Barbie"

[Chorus]Picture you and me on a private beach
Black sand on our feet, you’re clear water
Girl, I’m going under
Don’t you take your eyes off me
I’ll be diving in your deep blue sea

Gotta take a private jet to this private party
Me and you on a private island
Only guy, home for two, that’s ok ’cause you’re invited
That dress you’re wearing is so enticing
Looking so good make me wanna bite it
Only feel Michael Tyson

Girl, you make me wanna travel your body, body
Make me wanna go deep see diving, diving
I ain’t coming up, no, I ain’t coming up
Till I make you burst, till I get your hair fucked up
I can’t let you leave till I make you come

Picture you and me on a private beach
Black sand on our feet, you’re clear water
Girl, I’m going under
Don’t you take your eyes off me
I’ll be diving in your deep blue sea

This water is kicking in
I’mma take you outta here
Let’s go short of slow
‘Cause I know you wanna dance
Baby, I’m diving in
I’mma let your love wash me

Picture you and me on a private beach
Black sand on our feet, you’re clear water
Girl, I’m going under
Don’t you take your eyes off me
I’ll be diving in your deep blue sea

Picture you and me on a private beach
Black sand on our feet, you’re clear water
Girl, I’m going under
Don’t you take your eyes off me
I’ll be diving in your deep blue sea[Intro: Kevin McCall]
I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
More time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
No no, I've been so many places chasing paper under the sun
Wanna start a fam but girl I can't be faithful to one
I got a problem, and it ain't like I don't feel for you babe
And I hate to see them tears on your face
But I can't erase all the memories we've made
Got my brain going crazy, it's like I'm stuck in the maze
Don't lose your hope in me, but if you keep the faith
All you secrets is safe with me take the shit to the grave

[Hook: Kevin McCall]

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
No no, cause I'm a heart breaker (heart breaker)
I'm a heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
I'm drinking champagne from out the bottle

[Verse 2: Gucci Man]
I'm drinking Ace of Spades like that shit bottle water
I'm drinking Ace of Spades like that shit bottle water
I got the preacher's daughter doing all the shit I taught her
Go so hard I might break them hoes
Dick so hard I might break her jaw
Cold hearted I ain't got no heart
Broke bitch she don't want no job
How you gonna help when times get hard
Ride or die, but she ain't got no car
Push button I ain't got no key
Want to marry me and take half my stash
Break her heart broke the bitch in half
Hate these hoes but I love my fans
We have a doubt but the shit won't last
It's a plane crash the way I drop my bags
Hand in hand the way I made this cash
I ain't trying to give it up so fast
Blast smash now you in my past
100 bags used to wipe my ass
Ace of Spades I don't need no glass
Got racks in my pants so the hoes go dance

[Hook: Kevin McCall][Verse 1: Chris Brown]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Hook]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna
Say bye bye
Say bye bye
Say bye bye to her
You made me wanna
Say bye bye
Say bye bye
Say bye bye to her

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, used to be valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care, but I ain't get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we're both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club
I rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don’t never feel like we vibin'
Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you tripping for?
I don’t wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think its better if I let you know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I’m a dick, so it shouldn’t be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complain
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Probably didn’t register, don’t trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick
She give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don’t care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

[Hook][Chris Brown]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Drake]
What you mean I ain’t call you? I hit you when I landed
I’m waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguing more and it’s getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she’ll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I’ll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I’m willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you’ll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It’s useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind, again, again. and deuces I must throw ya peace

[Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I’mma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
I’m stupid but I won’t get my drama on
What I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talking 'bout

[Fabolous]
According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shits? you ain't gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better you’d do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Chris Brown]
So you gonna diss me even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gonna

[Drake]
(miss me a little when I’m gone)

[Fabolous]
Drizzy voice, now I’m ghost baby
Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I’m bout my business boys, plus I make paper
Come on that's old news, yesterday’s paper
Oh, you talking, what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth
You’ll never score another me, I’ll shut it out
Act like there’s gum in your hair girl, cut it out

[Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag #red Louis belt
How can you love me baby, first you gotta love yourself

[Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if I was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop making sad songs

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her; to her(Hook)
It could all be simple
But we make it so hard
Find that true lover...lover
Gotta find that one lover...lover
It could all be simple
If heartbreak was painless
Gotta fight for one another...another
Not fuck with eachother...eachother

(Verse 1)
If beauties in the eyes of the beholder
You're reflection must be in the eyes of jehovah
Your bodies so c-c-cold you gon' catch pneumonia
Cause it's a cold world and heartbreak is even colder
If you ever truly felt love, you don't believe in fairy-tale love
If you believe in the dream you should sell one
To all the broken hearts that's tryna rebuild love
Wish they could feel love, I'm talkin' real love (real love)

(Hook)
It could all be simple
But we make it so hard
Find that true lover...lover
Gotta find that one lover...lover

(Verse 2)
Look, look I see shorties who never had they father
Always lookin' for love and always comin' up with nada
So as soon as a random nigga come up and holla
She fall in love and find herself in another problem, damn
Oh well that's the tale of heart so frail
Now she crying in the lobby heartbreak hotel
Love is real but it sucks for beginners
We all lost love, so tell me who's the winners?
Two fourteen is the day that she remember
That's the day her warm heart turned colder than december
That's the type of shit that turn a saint to a sinner
If love conquers all fuck it, I surrender...but remember

(Hook)
It could all be simple
But we make it so hard
Find that true lover...lover
Gotta find that one lover...lover

(Bridge)
Even with all your imperfections
You're beautiful to me
I love your flaws cause that's what makes you
So beautiful to me...to me and it could be...

(Hook)
It could all be simple
If heartbreak was painless
Gotta fight for one another...another
Not fuck with eachother...eachother[Hook: 2 Chainz / Drake]

[Verse: Kevin McCall]
I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Call the clique Columbine, cause they all killers
No competition, but this election of model missis
Call her sick, cause her head game vicious
All I wish is, that I had a Swisher with marijuana
Faded off the Usher Raymond, girl you make me wanna
Lick you from your neck, to your ill nana
Taste so good it make you wanna slap your momma
God damn (got damn), I love (I love), that pussy poppin'
I’m throwin' hunnads, like yeah (like yeah)
It’s nothin' (it's nothin'), California show you niggas how to function
Scrap away the ass and my leopard all time
They call me Frankie Roosevelt cause all I fuck is dimes
Say you got a man and baby that’s fine
Yeah you got his name tatted, but tonight that pussy mine
I go on and on and on and on yeah
I'mma feel this liquor in the morning
Both my chick and whip is foreign
You struggle to pay the rent, I’m payin the mortgage, bitch!

Turn down (turn down), all the lights (all the lights)
Trynna set the mood, bitch don’t kill my vibe (my vibe)
You wanna fly (wanna fly), take a ride (take a ride)
And I’ll take you higher than I
You belong in the sky, shinin' (shinin')
Your beauty is forever like diamonds (diamonds)
Timeless, oohoohohoh

Shit got damn, sexy motherfucker, let me take you to the head
Take you to the crib, lay you in the bed
Wake up in the morning, fuck you good again

[Kevin McCall]
I keep taking you niggas bitches, that's my fuckin problem
My nigga we could light it up if you're tryna solve 'em[Verse 1: D&D]
I know this ain't a strip club, but it’s looking that way
Bottle lady bring them fireworks my way
She popping on a nigga and they love me, I can throw a stack
Got it baby girl, I can touch it if you want it
I can make it, make it, make it, make it nasty
Guarantee it ain't a lot of girls that walk past me, past me, past me
Girl, you looking fancy
Drop top convertible, you know I be smashing

[Pre-Chorus: D&D]
What’s Gucci? Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, that booty, booty, booty
Girl turn around, why? That booty do something to me, to-to me
What’s Gucci, Gucci, Gucci? That booty, booty, booty
Girl turn around, that booty do something to me, to-to me

[Chorus: D&D]
Girl, I wanna see you dance, twerk up and down, twerk up and down

Will you pop it for a stack? Twerk up and down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Pop it for a stack, girl
You know what it is, racks on racks on racks girl
I wanna see you strip
So which one of y'all coming back to the crib
Throwing money in your face girl
I see you winding up your waist girl
If you didn't know girl you’re fucking with a winner
Conversation with your ass can I take it out to dinner, dinner, dinner?

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
I got a lot of hoes, I should water something
They give me super head, call them wonder women
Throw it in reverse, better blow your back out, balling
Crib full of money call it stack house
Hop in the Panamera and smash out
Keep on popping it for me, l’ll have you racked out
Bitches see the crib, and wanna move in
After I hit it and quit it I throw that ass out
These niggas mad cause they need money
You wasn't wide blind, you just never seen money
Louis Belt cost a couple hunnids
She wanna fuck with me and Breezy, so I told to her run it, run it
Dime piece, she a dozen
If you married I can hit it better than your husband
K-Mac, I know you heard of me
I'm throwing hunnids with D&D, so pop it for a

[Chorus][Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Now what you ladies tryna get in?
Extra large Magnum's the only one I'm fitting
Open up your mouth baby I can be your dentist
Before I go too far let's go back to the beginning
My paper, your nigga shit be rented
Suicide doors and she dying to get in
They looking at my stank cause they know I be shitting
They try to keep me out cause they know I take they women

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown]
Aye meet me outside ask your girl what she think about ménage, models all day
Me plus you then we add another girl up in the room
Bring it back, bring it back  and sit that big ol booty all up on my lap
Matter fact, here go a stack, private party and I don't know how to act

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Shawty so, call the girls cause I'm a looking for a bad chick
Put your hands in the air if you a bad chick
Ain't gotta ask for it, she gon' let have it when she let me have it, I'mma let her have it
I'mma let you have it girl, I'mma let you have it girl, I'mma let you have it, I'mma let you have it, daddy can you have it?

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, I pull up black man, black Porsche rag
Really make him mad hop yo ass in
Oh this your first time ride let me hit the gas
Don't you play with me later or this will be your last
I'm a rude rude nigga let me have it
You got that big booty poking, now let me grab it
I'm something like the king fuck you on the mattress
Writing tats out my name on the dash then I smack it like

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Now let me find out you'll let me blow your spine out
Sex game mean, make you call it time out
Quarter 'til we can rendezvous back at my house
That pussy crack got me fiending like Amy Winehouse
If I give you 9, can I get that other 60?
When it come to licky licky, we can split it 50/50
Peanut butter skully have you cuming in a jiffy
Damn skippy swallow my juniors, king griffy

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook][Intro: Kevin McCall]
Cyeah, it's me and C Breezy
You know, okay I'll admit it, we fucked up

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
I'm in the club, fuck about a service
I take my own shots, Texaco berence
Once your shawty see me and C Breezy, boy it's curtains
Spilling Ace of Spades on the carpet, but it's on purpose
My house look like a circus, dick look like a serpent
This look like a movie, one take, no rehearsing
She twerking it for this money so I feel like she deserve it
I'mma put my thing down, she took it and reverse it
Like I miss it, I'm pissy like I got a weak bladder
Tipsy off this Cristy, nigga it don't even matter
Boy I'm loco, cuckoo
Call me Sub Zero cause I'm so cold
Ha, you see that booty? She could make a fortune
No wonder her body cold cause she drop dead gorgeous
You don't get it? You slower than a motherfucker
Dummy, I'm rolling so I'm on than a motherfucker

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
I'm fucked up, I'm brain dead
Walking round like the club like I don't know what day it is
I'm high, higher than a plane bitch
Walking round like the club like I don't know what day it is
Monday I be balling, Tuesday I be balling
Wednesday I be balling, man these bitches keep on coming
Thursday I be chilling, but Friday I be killing
Saturday and Sunday, that's the motherfucking weekend

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look, yeah, cause I'm smoking super fire from my lighter
I want her with the stripes cause I know that she a tiger
Engine growling like a bitch so I pull up right beside her
I tell her hop up in, upgrade, I supersize her
150 grand chain, what you doing ho?
Two girls in the bed, guess I'm 2-0
Gold wrappers, better wrap it like a tuna roll
Yep, your body ain't bad girl you're beautiful
Yikes, my watch only cost your car though
Three girls, your dog and a pack of smokes
Ha, my roof what? Alligator bitch
I'm stunting in the club like I don't know what day it is
Yeah, these little mamas in pyjamas
And I'm in this club huh, and it feel like the Bahamas
Bad bitches in the front and the boom's right behind us
I'm super fucked up, hey I'm just being honest, yikes

[Chorus x2][Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It kills me to see you cry, even more when I tell a lie
And it's always something I do to you baby
And I'm so sorry for all the things that I did
And I can't say goodbye, or let you just walk away
So I'll admit my wrongs, and I hope you hear this
Cause it's a song I made for you
And I'm hoping maybe, I can win back your heart
So please don't say goodbye, I know the love's still there somewhere

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Wish I could give the world
And I know it hurts sometimes
When you deserve the world
Nothing comes in between us
So you can never separate me from your love
Oh darling
I'm never ever letting go
Cause I love you more than life itself

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Just want you on my team girl, and I don't give a damn about nothing else
But the way I feel with you is so amazing, yeah
If I never get to see you, oh
Then I might as well never even open my eyes
I love you so, that I can't let you go
And I ain't trying to be selfish no oh, oh
Just had to tell you, that you've got my heart
And only you can tear it apart, yeah ho, ooh ooh

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
You make it easy, easy to love you
So I ain't gotta look nowhere else
I know I found the right one
Call me crazy, but I love my baby, more than anything
And something's taking over
Anything you want I hand it over
I'mma ride this thing 'till the wheels fall off
'Til the end of time I'm forever yours, yours

[Chorus]
+
Oh no
I love you more than life itself, woah
