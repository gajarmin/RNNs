[Now this is time for free your mind and your soul
Yo, half the story has never been told
Ladies, you got to demand what you want And what we want is respect, right?
Yo, listen up on the track here so I can feel if it rides
Freedom everytime for the sisters.. Check us, watch this]

[Queen Latifah]
Now here we go now... Listen, If Hip Hop ruled I'd be the ruler like Slick Rick
Get with this quick witted Adidas wearing chick
Papa got a brand new bag, Mama got a brand new Jag
A gold tag, I ain't no old hag
I represent not only in the kitchen, in the bedroom
But also in the boardroom so give me more room
Deny me my opportunity, you in jeopardy
Yo-Yo, set me free, oh and then let me be
[Yo-Yo]
I'm fightin' for freedom, I got the heat in case you need 'em
I'm a straight soldier, ain't nobody told ya?
Hold up on them lies, I know your games and your plans
Do whatever you can to oppress the man
But when it's time to drop the bomb bring the funkiness on
You say you never met a sister so strong, you're wrong
Now how can we be free? It takes you and it takes me to live together in harmony
And peace and love and all of the above
Sisters comin' together representing one love
No disrespect, but we gotta get it together
No matter what's the weather, sisters gotta stick together
And sisters be strong, don't let 'em steer you wrong, hold on
Cuz sisters got it goin' on, yeah

[Left-Eye]
Whoever said these are the things that you can do
And the things you ain't supposed to?
So am I further when I think I'm getting closer?
That's when I tend to think of Rosa
How Rosa took a seat to make a stand
But now in standin' we gettin' more demanding
And they never thought of plannin'
That a wish for us to sit would be a dose of this fuckin' rollercoaster
Whether tradition or religion, why you question my decision?
Why you spend up all your time tryin' to get into my mind?
How everybody and their mama gots to add to all my drama
Mad drama, hell if I'm gonna keep my dominating, feministic, hell-creating
CrazySexyCool, black ass in the palms of your player-hater's stance
My only chance of being free is to fly within me and it's illegal
To kill a fuckin' eagle
A bird is never more important than my people
I guess we didn't need him so I took away his freedom

[MC Lyte]
My spiritual awareness leads me to believe
That you're doubtin' the sisters to come with the peace
We've been together since Jah created water
The African border, celebration is in order
Pop the cork and give champagne to the stork
That brought the Lyte to my Mama in New York
African I come again + again
You kick me down I get back up I'm comin back in multiples of 10
[Nefertiti]
You know where I come from Slung
From the belly of the beast, used to speak African tongue
So I showed her, next one rolled her Slung the devil over my shoulder
I'm gettin' over cuz I'm bolder than the next
Tell me nothin' cuz I speak the real truth from the text
Who's next to flex with this s-i-s-t-e-r?
The sun, the moon, the crescent, the star; well let's see how open you are

[Me'Shell NdegéOcello]
Come and take a walk with me, closer walk with thee, see what only I can see
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
So it's back to the womb of everlasting life and truth
Let the heaven of a sister embrace you, and praise 'em of the gods
Come into the light, let it shine, blackness is fine
The blackness of the skin, the blackness of the mind

[Salt-N-Pepa]
I am who I am and that's who I be And I don't give a damn if your eyes can't see
If you can't see what I can see
That you're blind, baby, by a woman who's black
So back up, back up cuz it's on I'm-a tell ya strong what's wrong
With the world that we're living on
It ain't who ya know, it ain't what ya drive
It's about how you feel about yourself on the inside
When your self-esteem is low and they call you a ho, then you think you's a ho
But that ain't what the Lord God made you to be
I need you to see; you're black and you're free[Patra]
