[Verse 1: Criminal Manne]
Just look in my eyes you can tell I'm a G
I ain't no maybe between it, It's just plain to see
I done been through it all
And I still stand tall
Done lost more than I gained
But still manage to ball
I'm MVP like Kobe
I made it rich off the streets
And got shot and robbed and did time from the streets
Took trips for bricks and made it right back safe
Done buried two of my brothers thats why I'm strapped with the K
They never said it was easy but me I like the fast cash
Been a boss since birth I had the change and bags
Now thirty some years later I'm still on the same shit
Catch me crossing the border with three bitches with bricks
I'm the neighborhood hero some say I'm an idol
Cause I move so quick and get that paper like Michael
I should've went to the pros from high school but no
I found myself in the trap cooking bagging up O's
Hanging with the old heads I always thought I was grown
That's why at sixteen years old I was out on my own
Staying house to house I dipped quick for cash
Wasn't no living and chilling I had to chase that cash
Never been the club type I always wanted that money
While most danced and partied I was counting my money
????
I ran the streets on my own
I didn't go back in until the dope was gone
Some say I was crazy but me I call it the hustle
They say cash run the world, well then cash is my muscle
I made plays off phones made $70,000 at home
Didn't have to do no footwork I made a call to my clones
AKA my lil' goons don't get it twisted they killers
Since I'm feeding my circle, Know they will die for a nigga
You ain't get nowhere if you cross that line
And if it's about my cash man yo ass is dying
I got a plug out in Cali
Got everything that I want
So when I'm done with my socket
I can go buy what I want
I bought an S550 all black with forgi's
Rode that bitch though the hood and had multiple orgi's
You couldn't do what I do if I gave you my shoes
A lot of you niggas is lost with still something to prove
Don't know the meaning of stacking
Don't have a clue about the profit
While love made niggas ballin they on the sideline watchin
You know them funny ass niggas
That always got something to say
Always flaugin the bitches
Screaming that they getting paid
But really just in a way
It's like nobody is straight
Everybody scream team but deep down they gay
Whatever happened to chiefs
Whatever happened to indians
Everybody's a boss that's why my young niggas getting em
Sticking straps to they face
Kicking doors in, robbing
????
I do this shit for the hood
I do this shit for the streets
Every time I drop I'm giving you more of me
Uncut foreal no soda just blow
?????
I'm gymnastic with white
The God man with weed
I done sold it all
Except heroin and speed
I'm allergic to broke
Thats why I go so hard
And I don't plan on stopping
Unless it's a calling from God
All my niggas they huddle up saying crim go ham
Thats why I brought you this crack, Blow 3.5 Grams
All my niggas they huddle up saying crim go ham
Thats why I brought you this crack, Blow 3.5 Grams
Nigga![Hook x2: Young C]
All I know is blow (blow)
All I talk is blow (blow)
Bad bitches in the kitchen whipping with no cloths
Same shit, different day, bigger bank roll
And I can't take a break until I get this shit sold

All I know is blow

[Verse 1: Criminal Manne]
Million dolla blow
I should have been a track starter
The way I wipped in 2008 I could've been a chef-star
Made 300 thousand last year, off the crack
Another 245 off the pounds, top that
I'm a fucking bussiness man
And no play by my bussiness nigga
Come up show with digits, these ass gonna come up missing
I keep 6 bad bitches on deck, could take the charge
In my baby mama house living [?]
I bought a Audi in the jag, just to hit the highway
And they full of marijuana to the pills to the jay
Got my old lady wondering will I ever stop this things
She say she having bad dreams about me going to jail, man
I'm insane...

[Hook x2: Young C]

[Verse 2: Young C]
What you know about stayin up 3 or 4 days
Open the stove, swaving bullets like a damn slave
Phone steady ringing, dope steady swanging
Knocks hard on block, but I'm steady slinging
Keep a big old pistol on me, chopper in the duffel
Blow your ass off, if you fucking up my hustle
50 racks, 30 minutes do your calculations
No calculator needed when I fucking with them haters
And everytime I take that triples like a celebration
Your bitch said she was celibatist until she saw my bracelet
100 thousand dollar Koop with a stupid lift
That'll show you pussy niggas that I do this shit

[Hook x2: Young C][Hook]
He say he want a quarter blow for the low
But this go high, the streets dry so hit the door
My nigga you gotta go
Cause I ain't trying to hear that shit
I ain't trying to hear that shit (Yeeahh)
She say she wanna hit the room with your boy
But then she broke, just wanna fuck
What the fuck, fucking bitch you gotta go
Cause I ain't trying to hear that shit
I ain't trying to hear that shit (Yeeahh)

[Verse 1]
Minae done make dollars
Minae done make cents
If we ain't talking about cash
Then we ain't talking about shit
Everyday not promising, I'm getting money and ball
Take care of your family, take care of your dogs
Ain't no use in just doing stupid shit because you can
Why just be a doughboy when you can be the big man?
I try so hard to get rich
I ain't thinking about no bitch
Because when I through smashing her, I'm like "What did I get?"
So I continue to grind
I'm going hard for my kids, and then I pay baby mamas
On top of feeding my kids and then my whole squad nigga
My team depending on me, if I ain't buying the sack
Then how the fuck we gonna eat?
Nigga, how the fuck we gonna eat?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Thinking it might be fatal, so I'm going dumb hard
I got a woman at home, she sit and wait for the call
So I keep my protection
And thank god for blessing me, I could've been a dead nigga
Broke, fucked up, I'm telling ya
So with that being said, I'm very cautious on trust
I don't trust nobody, I don't believe in luck
Everything that's happening is suppose to happen for real
Yeah, I'm on life insurance
Incase a nigga get killed, I gotta make sure [?]
My little family correct, because they can't get social security
I never had a [?], I'm from the streets of Memphis
Where niggas robbing for bags, where niggas stay paranoid
Don't wanna get that toe tag
Don't wanna get that toe tag
