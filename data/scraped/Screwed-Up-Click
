Screwed Up Click that is, representing for DJ Screw
The legend (DJ Screw), my nigga

[Hook - 2x]
It's the take over, bout to give this industry a new makeover
And for those who have waited, now the wait's over
We too heavy for these niggas, so they can't hold us
It's the take over

[Mike D]
One mo' gin for your mind, it's the cat Corleone
My link to the click, connect like Voltron
A teflon Don, draped in Sean John
Yes and you'd catch me, seven days on chrome
I'll tell ya, what it took to build the Screwed Up Click
It took grind it took tears, it took years
Dealing with incarceration, plus losing a few peers
Tried to take me out the game, but I's still here
Nigga, now let's get one thang clear
Only God I fear, nan nigga round here
Cause I rep it for my G's, and true cake holders
2004 Screwed Up Click, it's the take over

[Chris Ward]
You tuned in, to the almighty S.U.C
We'll never break up niggas wake up, who's the best you see
It's C. Ward, the last of the last real niggas to be
Now here's for H.A.W.K., Pocino, Lil' O, Ke' and Yiggity-Ye
We smoke that under water grown, we like we live in the sea
Whenever asked if we the shit, I say fa shiggity G
We rep it step it accept it, we holding it down
It's the worldwide, take over we controlling it now

[H.A.W.K.]
The big dog is barking, so all puppies on the porch
The General of the force, I'm holding down the fort
You on a collision course, to get your ass scorched
And I'll fire up a blunt, off Ms. Liberty's torch
We'll use brute force, and show no remorse
Fuck ya like intercourse, and never been in the Source
I rep Houston, like Jigga reps New York
In a six the same color, as cranberry sauce

[Big Pokey]
A nigga, taking over the game
I'm in the driver seat, mind state fuck it when I'm holding the grain
Sensei brings the pain, takes the show
I whip niggas with this pen, like I'm taking the sco'
Niggas think I'm moving fast, but I'm taking it slow
I'm in the booth cooking snow, bringing back flow
I breathe money, flip it and bring back mo'
Screwed Up Click, at your front and your back do' nigga

[Mr. 3-2]
Connected like ball and chain, a cut like cocaine
Standing on frontline, prepping Screwed Up name
Blood sweat and pain, we hungry and wanna eat
Walk and stomp over this game, with bare feet
Fake niggas cheap, we keeping it one hundred
Our verses ain't cheap, and they never get fronted
We finally done it, united as a click
Slowing the world down, taking over this bitch

[Lil' Keke]
We went from hungry and broke, to niggas with big wealth
Fat Pat-Lil' Ke, the name speaks for itself
The click was born, we got money by the ton
S.U.C. for life, us soldiers is day one
Southside controlled, and niggas was laying it down
R.I.P. to Screw, the king of the underground
The take over, and it sound like thunder
Screwed Up Click for real, they call me the Boy Wonder

[Lil' O]
Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, niggas know what it is
Smother your mother, clap your father rope up the kids
Pull out the army knife, go from your throat to your ribs
Snitch nigga don't slang, if you can't cope with the biz
It takes a special kinda dude, to stand tough in handcuffs
Tell the FED's fuck you, I ain't giving my man up
If you that type of cat, throw up your set and stand up
It's Screwed Up Mafia, get your grams up motherfucker

[E.S.G.]
T's for Texas nigga, where that S.U.C. from
The A's for the A.K.'s, we spread them haters huh
Now K's for the kilos, we whooping in the kitchen
E's for E.S.G., Escalade and 24 twisting
O's for the on the grind, how we stay on the Southside
The V for victory, E-R everybody ride
It took a lot of time, but we finally here
For my nigga Screw, take over bitch this year what

[Z-Ro]
I ain't even much gotta say my name, you know who it is it's simple and plain
I fuck up a face and I leave blood stains, and wet up a motherfucker like the rain
I don't love nothing but the S.U.C., no name rad niggas let me be
I'm from the Guerilla M double A-B, we hunt people and set spirits free
Call me a killer call me the Crooked, you want a concert Red Boy gon book it
Look at the rap game the way I took it, with a ape on my back but a real nigga shook it
Just like a pit I'ma lock and shake, put the plex aside we got money to make
The Soldiers United with Cash, taking over baby

[Clay-Doe]
We took being independent to the limit, now we finished
Now God as my witness, we bout to handle some major bidness
Rep the click anthem, 'til it's read substantials
So don't get personal now, it's all financial
I had to bow down, the fear roll past rollers
Put 27 stash masks, on the cup holders
Grade A cocka, insane soldier
Clay fucking doja, for the take over

[Trae]
Well it's 2K we the last of the breed, mobbing with chrome
Any nigga got a problem, I swear to God I'm fin to click bitch and it's on
Screwed Up Click guerillas for scrilla, these fake niggas get dusted
Came from broke and disgusted, but now these niggas mad cause they busted
I'm a soldier, see Trae never been fake fuck friends
I'm about my click the Mob united for cash, for life and I'm never gon quit
The take over is over my nigga, and I promise it ain't gon stop
We run this shit for Screw, and all competition gotta be dropped

[Grace]
Making moves to monopolize, gotta plot plan and strategize
Ahead of the other guys, off the chain better realize
They call me Dat Boy Grace, a poetic picture painter
Screwed Up Click representer, prepare to deadly for paper
Blood sweat and tears we done shed, click then united the bread
It's time to do what we do, take over turn bunch of heads
With over rations verbate 'em, vivid victory vindicated
With a vision of vulk, you can validate what I'm saying

[Hook](*talking*)
For the grown and sexy
S.U.C. style, that's what it is man

[Hook]
Since I seen you, we've been people
You're my equal, this love is see through
I wanna keep you, I wanna be with you

[Lil' Keke]
It's been rapture for love, since I layed eyes on ya
You captured a thug, and a real nigga wants ya
Hips thighs legs, boo you a woman
Horse on the track, baby girl keep running
So-so jazzy, but a skeet taste nasty
She was Jaguar classy, couldn't let that pass me
True sex appeal, with the looks that kill
Flat stomach fat ass, with Stilleto heels
I'm a gangsta making money, so sugar that's what it's bout
If you talking my lil' language, then bitch just speak it out
I'm a superstar, but this chick got value
In a slab day, dreaming of a moment to have ya
H-Town, and I'm known as a playa
Key to the city, VIP like the mayor
I'm looking in your eyes, it's the windows to your soul
28 years old, and I'm Northpole cold

[Hook]

[Big Pokey]
The sun, won't shine forever
But as long as it's here, then we might as well shine together
Have you rocking crock coats, and the finest leather
Full-in minks, D.G. boots and better
D.R. suits and sweaters, I got it you got it
And the best part of getting it, is when I get you up out it
I'm vibing on your skin tone, trying to be alone
Wanna move you down put you up, so I could be at home
But your curves, got a nigga attention
I need a broad with benefits, like a 9-5 with a pitching
I'm digging in your trenches, get some wig on the benches
Sit you on the 20 inches, there's corners need some frenches
For real, let's run up in the room and chill
Ocean view, we can see the moon in here
Cook a nigga some'ing, let me bump some'ing slow
Give it to me in the bed, and wake up on the flo'
I know what I know, and I can see what it show
When it talk to me, say I don't need another ho you know

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
Was it love at first sight, or the sound of loud pipes
Or the lights on the chrome, on my Harley bike
Your jeans were so tight, that ass was just right
I'm feeling like Betty Write, tonight's the night
Since my game was up to par, and you know who I are
I raised the bar, had you standing there in aw
Now check my repitoure, since we are people
One plus one, always equal
Two, me up inside of you
Hiding you, cause I can't confide in you
And now the plot thickens, and I'm on a mission
Switching positions, hitting from the couch to the kitchen
Now baby girl listen, as I whisper in your ear
It go all up in ya, just like the pas-mere
We share so many years, and I want you to know
I'ma keep you by my side, and I don't wanna let you go

[Hook][Everybody talking]
Man it's about five in the motherfuckin' morning (Ha, ha, ha)
And a nigga can't sleep (Ha, ha, ha), ya know what I'm sayin'
I'm thristy than a bitch, what's the deal
Shit I'm bout to call up my bitch in the paint
See what she up to, know what I'm sayin'
Pull over and see what's the deal, know what I'm sayin'
Nineteen ninety motherfuckin' nine (Nineteen ninety nine)
Nineteen ninety nine, can't you see, nineteen ninety nine
(The whole Screwed Up Family) third coast, H-Town
Texas ballers (Real G's hook it up)
Got my money on my mind (Cause we down south)

[Hook]
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
Screwed Up Click for life and ya know we put it down
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
Finger on our trigga nigga, hand on our nine

[DJ Screw]
I gotta thinkin' that I'm makin money all day
And to my niggas that know, we all ball this way
Never ever set trippin' got love for G's
Pimpin' on my nigga, rise up of these
I broke em' off in 92 schools, shit on the under
96, 97 gotta trunk full of thunder
All screwed up, pausin' music in the streets
And got the Feds kickin' down doors searchin' for the cheese
Down south, black Jeeps slangin' dope ass tapes
Chopin' up records, spittin' game in the brace
Outsiders lookin' in tryin' to see what I'm doin'
I'm inside lookin' out now they plan is ruined
Police takin' pictures of the crib yellin' "Drugs sold"
100,000 sold, what the fuck I need drug fo'
DJ Screw, independent in this game
Sippin' Cogn with my niggas, ain't a damn thang changed

[Hook x2]

[Al-D]
I didn't fall off like ya thought I would
I done hopped of lockdown, ballin' in the hood
G'd up on the set, soakin' wet
Hoes lickin' my sweat, from my ankles to my neck
And I ain't through yet, fixin' to cash my check
Smoke a gank of stanky dank and ride until the sunset
In my Hoo-Doo jammin' nothin' but screw-zoo
Makin' boo-koo, I'm on the ends like I used to
Still true to the game, swervin' lane to lane
Mary Jane got my window pane foggy in the rain
And man what a shame I feel so good
Fresh off lock, a nigga back in the hood
Ballin' outta control pockets roll to get swole up
Screwed Up Click worldwide and takin' over
Southside for life, this is Al-D
Livin' my life as a young black G

[Hook x2]

[Mike-D]
Yeah my cars roll candy and my hoops stay tinted
Southside, 3rd Ward represent like I'm in it
Now these niggas out here comin' and these cuts ain't givin' a damn
Better adapt, as they strapped, why these hoes got me tapped
Get a slub and hit em' in the freckles
Lookin' for Hyde crock a lie with the Jekyll
Chick be a trip so I peep when I flip
They get more and more hip with every bumpin' hit
With the turns, lettin' it burn, dodgin' white folks
Zones to the dome got me guffed in weed smoke
These streets be like freaks ready to fuck, butt naked
Get some of that head when they least expect it
Glock sittin' on my hood's hip and I'mma bail
That shit was hell, had my ace brain under my fingernail
Better smell the dope analyze the lines
Gone off pine stayin' crooked all the times

[Hook x2]

[Clay-Doe]
In this game if ya snooze ya lose
I paid my dues, roads to riches is the path I choose
Stackin' my fetti full focus, with my eyes on the prize
Watchin' for hoes and foes while I'm on the uprise
Fill the heater with extra clips, rollin' so low
Cause ya never know what homo wanna break ya off on the low low
Ridin' for mine cause I trust my bitch, my Glock
For these niggas that shortstop, I bombard they road blocks
And marked for death versus a damn Mafia hit
Got me fucked up from droppin' LP's with the Click
We talk the talk and we walk the walk
Realest niggas from the south straight hoggin' with the galk
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
My fingers on my trigga and I'm gone off nine

[DJ Screw ad-libs](*talking*)
Uh-huh uh uh, yeah yeah (bout to break some'ing off)
You now tuned in, to the Dirty 3rd district the Southside of H-Town
Yeah and look, I'm bout to rip this here beat
I wanna give a shout out, to the C.M.B. Cash Money Millionaires
You know, I like what they did Lil' Wayne you fly on this one here
Mannie you fresh than a mo'fucker, it's your boy
I'm C. Ward around these here parts, yeah-yeah (C. Weezy)
All of that and some, some'ing like that, yeah-yeah yeah

[Chris Ward]
You see I'm some'ing like a playa, some'ing like a G
I bet some'ing on some'ing, you ain't nothing like me
So stop fronting like you me, saying you C. Ward
Cause the streets gon keep me laced, like a pair of Nikes
The hustle plus those that hate, is what entice me
You wanna know mo' bout C. Weez, let me give you some advice G
I say the hustle plus those that hate, is what entice me
You wanna know mo' bout C. Weez, let me give you some advice G
Me low Caddy coupe, top look ricey
Cherry red gold, and all the stones is icey
I dropped out for this shit here, it's kinda pricey
Plus majors keep calling around here, trying to price me
Now when I rap, I don't speak nicely
For the fact, the way I act is just kinda sheisty
I like my women fine, they attitude is spicey
Hot at all times, like some crooked trick dice be
I'm smooth like Avon, better yet like Rayon
I'm the veteran rookie, why else you think I'm playing
It's pussycat niggas like you, that we prey on
And the jewelry box I got, look like it's sponsored by Crayon
I got the whole, world tipsy
Leaning off the shit that I drink, except my name's not J-Kwon
I'm the B.G. of this click, and I'm holding it down
For those, who been representing it since day one
And that's why, I do what I do
For the late great DJ Screw, whoo
Fronting around here, will get your neck clipped off
I ain't bout taking no shorts, or no rip off's
I'm bout to button up the top, and straight tip off
Like a scratched up c.d., I'm about to skip off
Track down here, and use to we whip soft
In the hardcore crack you get it, we whip soft
And I don't know if you understand, or is you feeling my slang
Though it's not Lil' Wayne, I'm bout my cash money mayn
You see I'm fresh like Mannie, with a three story compressed
Into a one story flat, being built right now you understand me

[Clay-Doe]
Hold up, before and through
Get the motherfucking lighters back lit, for DJ Screw
Niggas don't know, bout that H-O-U
It's like the whole 4-4-2, is hating on you
Who walk identicle twins, to his talk black
And got identicle Glocks, in his raw black
Living murder you heard of, but of no dirt crack
And we serving them birds boy, we don't know how to act
I heard from the 3rd, got no problems with that
Matter of fact, let's get to the bottom of the facts
Catch Doe-shis, in the bottle with some crack
Hand painted from the top, to the bottom of the pack
Smoking that la-la, till the bottom of the sack
Extended clip, hanging out the bottom of the Mack
Trying to jack get hit, with the bottom of the gat
Choo-choo look fools, at the bottom of the track
Who-do's to 22's, on the bottom of the Lac
Bitch licking from the top, to the bottom of my tap
From the bottom of the rack, hit the bottom of the cat
And relax, and get that mind back on all do's
Take the Volvo, with the cargo
In the car do', rain daddy Wells Fargo
I got hands 'cross the land, like a bar code
A look in mirror, looking for some convo
Am I the realest, if I ain't nigga I don't know
You don't know, I'll tell you Doe
The Don, from the 3 Ward
Young C. Ward, and my S.U.C. squad bitch(*talking*)
H.A.-dub, (go getter music baby)
(hard coat to the bone, slowed up
Showed up), feel it

[Hook]
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it ain't drank don't mix it, never be a stray dog business
The flow, is unrealistic
The best unheard of, check my statistics

[H.A.W.K.]
You'll see, I'm the go to guy
Before I die, H.A.W.K. must sell multi
I ain't gon lie, I want more then a piece of the pie
I'm ready to die like B.I., so now you see why
I'm one of the best, ahead of the rest
Having success, I guess you could say I'm blessed
North and Southwest, I'm the number one reason
There's a motherfucking buzz, in the Southern region
Your flow is seasoned, I leave other MC's grieving
I'm fire breathing, so gon 'head retire a heathen
Now hate it for weak, I leave ya for dead
You heard what I said, don't play with my bread
Or blood gon shed, I'll lay your head
Or I'll have ya, using wheels for legs enough said

[Grace]
The flow is unreal, G-R possess skills
Untamed and off the chain, spit lyrics that can kill
Wreck tracks and stack bills, the boss among bosses
Undefeated for real, mo' wins and no losses
Purple potion mixed with poem, jump on down the road
Pen pimp a pad, plus it keep the two of mine thoed
Under rated overlooked, but daddy check out my stats
Gor the potentials to match, that show my ass on tracks
Greenstone game runner, let me do what I do
Jump in the booth and spit the real, bout P-A-T and the Screw
It's plain to see G-R a G, to the highest degree
And my mission is motivated, by the S.U.C
Stand tall and go hard, makes it foes are fraud
Separate the real from fake, and put it down for the mob
Lace 'em up and tie your shoes, bitch I'm one the trues
Spit it hit it sick with it, blow a ho nigga fuse

[Mike D]
It's Boss Hogg Corleone, Miggity Mike D
Give me a second, and these hoes gon feel me
Ain't a Crip or Loc, but I ride with my folk
My nigga Den Den, got me in this position
That I'm sitting in, him and that MJ
So I'ma make power moves, nigga push play
S.U.C., we coming this summer
Leave it up to me, we be back to back Hummers
Harley bikes, matching trucks give a fuck
Y'all know, Corleone stay buck
I'm on my note, I swear to God nigga
Y'all ain't ready to go, dollar for dollar figga for figga
Bitch, I'm seven months free
Touching more money, than these niggas on the streets
Y'all been out here bullshitting, playing ho games
I'm about my do', better ask Duke mayn
We some out of town riders, we some out of town gliders
On I-10, with them birds inside her

[Lil' O]
Ay I'm a fool with the tool, nigga ask about rap
Pick up this pen go to war like Iraq, bitch I'm back
Slugs hit your chest, and they come out your back
Man we shake niggas down, make 'em come out they stacks
This is Texas, punk I make ya come out your Lac
Screwed Up Click, we pull the guns out for Pat
Rest in peace, go hard stay we make a mess of the weak
Left his head on the curb, and his chest in the street
This is mean and vicious, you seem suspicious
Everytime I cook my work, I always clean the dishes
I write rhymes for hustlers, with crack dreams and wishes
I don't really fuck with niggas, always seen with bitches
The baddest hoes, Gucci shirts and Vesil jeans
The baddest clothes, boss among bosses how my status goes
See me at the table, watch me add this do'
So I can hit the boulo', and act bad on 4's
A hustler's hustler
A gangsta's gangsta, you a buster's buster
A snitch among snitches, Lil' O don't trust ya
With my hand behind my back, I'll just wink and they'll touch ya

[Lil' Keke]
Young Don the Boss, and there's not one colder
It's S.U.C., me teflon soldier
It's A-1 yola, or it won't mix
And my price range change, if you coming for six
Live life like a star, cause it's meant for me
And my game orchestrated, like the symphony
It's a death wish, like the black Charles Bronson
Pass and push rocks, like the great Magic Johnson
The streets bred me, them crack rocks fed me
The weapon that I pack, is still black and deadly
Chit-chat, this and that while I'm gone
Back with big nuts, and my game face on
Your ass don't cash, I'ma murder your crew
That's the shit, that a Custom Made Gangsta do
Don Ke S.U.C., man we do it with endurance
I hope your fam, got the plot and the insurance

(*talking*)
Do you hear this shit nigga
We ain't playing no games
We on your motherfucking ass mayn
This the take over bitch, (S.U.C. baby)(*Jadakiss*)
(I'll be by your side) General
We got these niggas, fucking cock-a-roaches
Wanna go to war, a-haaaa

[Big Pokey]
(I'll be by your side), like the gun I pack
When I sleep one eye closed, one eye cracked
Pitbull in the crib, keep one eye back
When Hector come around, I don't run out black
I'm right (by your side), when you need me nigga
I walk by faith, let the Lord lead me nigga
You can even be a hard, or a easy nigga
Rap need me, like George need Weezy nigga
I'm (by your side), whether right or wrong
Niggas choke under pressure, like you lighting a bone
If a nigga try to test, yeah I'ma get this nigga touched
While I'm at the crib layed back, writing a song
I'm (by your side), like a guard and a tackle
Caught a flight to N.Y., went hard in the Apple
Don't be mad cause your broad, in the car with a rapper
Think I'm slow you don't know, I'm the nigga to be right

[Hook]
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side, by your side
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side


[H.A.W.K.]
Like Siamese twins, from boys to men
Like nine, sitting next to ten
Like Mexicans, waiting for that work to come in
The best of friends, everybody think we kin
Cause I'm (by your side), like a nextdo' neighbor
If I know nothing else, I know Christ my savior
Sharp as a razor, even through bad behavior
He was still by my side, like a two-way pager
He's still (by your side), like a passenger seat
Or some peanut butter cuts, in a fo' do' Fleet
Like bass to a beat, I'll make ya complete
Like a couple cuddled up, in between the sheets
I'll be (by your side), even toughest of times
What's yours is mine, every quarter nickel and dime
I spit these rhymes, so that we both can shine
Although sometimes, you may cross the line
I'm still (by your side), like Luke to Vaketsky
Hockey to Wayne Gretzky, or a fly and his pesky
And times to test me, the situation can get messy
I can kill you sometimes, but God won't let me
Cause I'm (by your side), like May to June
Or an unborn child, in a mother's womb
Or a minister, marrying a bride and groom
Or the stars in the sky, next to the moon I'm still

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
(by your side) like 4-5 holsters
From the jail mug shots, to the c.d. posters
I'm a bad boy, nothing like that Martin and Will
From the streets of steel, where they train boys to kill
So I'm (by your side), like the Secret Service
We some three time felons, white folks are nervous
Credit plus capitas, that ass monopoly
I know your every move, like the Paparazzi
Cause I'm (by your side), like a million man march
Pass the microphone, like the Olympian torch
It's back to S.U.C., we still holding it down
In the paint posted up, for the next rebound
Cause I'm (by your side), like Jordan and Scottie
Like H.A.W.K. and Fat Pat, or like Poke' and Lotti
When your mind get weak, and your body is tired
You can open up your blind, cause I'm sitting outside right

[Hook](*talking*)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, music come on nigga

[Intro]

This is for my bitches, that'll suck and swallow nut
Little daddy get down, and bring back the bucks

[Mike D]
I'ma tell ya like this, Corleone don't need ya
All I'ma do, is let welfare feed ya
Better call ya man, of you want a nigga to eat ya
And ask somebody, how Corleone treat ya
Reach ya and teach ya, 68 sequel
All you can do, is juggle balls like receivers
Head hunter pleaser, no dick teaser
Keep the X-O, in case your friends wanna meet a
Boss Hogg nigga, like Mike D
Boss Hogg, from that 3-R-D
And I rep that, S.U. motherfucking to the C
To the day that I D-I-E, nigga feel me

[Mr. 3-2]
Break yourself beat your feet, bring it all back to Boss Man
Make boys rubber up, don't wanna see you coughing
Dirty leg bitches, gon get my kishey-ishey
Drop that pussy for Pimpin', now keep it nicely
Ho don't ask me questions, twerk your money maker
All night long, and buy me a thousand dollar dance
(You don't know who that is, bitch that's Pimpin' Chris
Tell 'em what you do to a bitch), breaking tricks
Snap the hotel up, in the fucking car sipping bar
High off X, or whatever it is plotting hundred dollar bills
Naw this ain't show biz, no kids
And old school playa, don't play the game right

[Hook]
Pop that pussy, pop that pussy
Pop that pussy, drop that pussy
Drop that pussy, drop that pussy
Take it down low, for a nigga to the flo' for a nigga
Know what I'm tal'n bout
Yeah, represent that Dirty South

[Clay-Doe]
Baby girl, take your position and show me
Let me see the position it's gon be, when it's gon be
Got 'em sprung, kept that tongue rolling
Give it to me mami, like you don't wanna owe me
Show me where that poll be, I know you get that money
Run aroused playing house, praying on them dummies
Mark that fire, now you fucking with a 3rd Ward rider
Southmore Slim, where playas and my priors
High rise windows, stay hit a lake causing
In the winter on the beach, in a short link mink
Dodge Charger, damn nail quarter broilers
Member for member, my click is straight brawlers
Smoke dro, 'til the end of the bottle
And lean, 'til we can't lean when we solve 'em

[Hook][Everybody talking]
Man it's about five in the motherfuckin' morning (Ha, ha, ha)
And a nigga can't sleep (Ha, ha, ha), ya know what I'm sayin'
I'm thristy than a bitch, what's the deal
Shit I'm bout to call up my bitch in the paint
See what she up to, know what I'm sayin'
Pull over and see what's the deal, know what I'm sayin'
Nineteen ninety motherfuckin' nine (Nineteen ninety nine)
Nineteen ninety nine, can't you see, nineteen ninety nine
(The whole Screwed Up Family) third coast, H-Town
Texas ballers (Real G's hook it up)
Got my money on my mind (Cause we down south)

[Hook]
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
Screwed Up Click for life and ya know we put it down
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
Finger on our trigga nigga, hand on our nine

[DJ Screw]
I gotta thinkin' that I'm makin money all day
And to my niggas that know, we all ball this way
Never ever set trippin' got love for G's
Pimpin' on my nigga, rise up of these
I broke em' off in 92 schools, shit on the under
96, 97 gotta trunk full of thunder
All screwed up, pausin' music in the streets
And got the Feds kickin' down doors searchin' for the cheese
Down south, black Jeeps slangin' dope ass tapes
Chopin' up records, spittin' game in the brace
Outsiders lookin' in tryin' to see what I'm doin'
I'm inside lookin' out now they plan is ruined
Police takin' pictures of the crib yellin' "Drugs sold"
100,000 sold, what the fuck I need drug fo'
DJ Screw, independent in this game
Sippin' Cogn with my niggas, ain't a damn thang changed

[Hook x2]

[Al-D]
I didn't fall off like ya thought I would
I done hopped of lockdown, ballin' in the hood
G'd up on the set, soakin' wet
Hoes lickin' my sweat, from my ankles to my neck
And I ain't through yet, fixin' to cash my check
Smoke a gank of stanky dank and ride until the sunset
In my Hoo-Doo jammin' nothin' but screw-zoo
Makin' boo-koo, I'm on the ends like I used to
Still true to the game, swervin' lane to lane
Mary Jane got my window pane foggy in the rain
And man what a shame I feel so good
Fresh off lock, a nigga back in the hood
Ballin' outta control pockets roll to get swole up
Screwed Up Click worldwide and takin' over
Southside for life, this is Al-D
Livin' my life as a young black G

[Hook x2]

[Mike-D]
Yeah my cars roll candy and my hoops stay tinted
Southside, 3rd Ward represent like I'm in it
Now these niggas out here comin' and these cuts ain't givin' a damn
Better adapt, as they strapped, why these hoes got me tapped
Get a slub and hit em' in the freckles
Lookin' for Hyde crock a lie with the Jekyll
Chick be a trip so I peep when I flip
They get more and more hip with every bumpin' hit
With the turns, lettin' it burn, dodgin' white folks
Zones to the dome got me guffed in weed smoke
These streets be like freaks ready to fuck, butt naked
Get some of that head when they least expect it
Glock sittin' on my hood's hip and I'mma bail
That shit was hell, had my ace brain under my fingernail
Better smell the dope analyze the lines
Gone off pine stayin' crooked all the times

[Hook x2]

[Clay-Doe]
In this game if ya snooze ya lose
I paid my dues, roads to riches is the path I choose
Stackin' my fetti full focus, with my eyes on the prize
Watchin' for hoes and foes while I'm on the uprise
Fill the heater with extra clips, rollin' so low
Cause ya never know what homo wanna break ya off on the low low
Ridin' for mine cause I trust my bitch, my Glock
For these niggas that shortstop, I bombard they road blocks
And marked for death versus a damn Mafia hit
Got me fucked up from droppin' LP's with the Click
We talk the talk and we walk the walk
Realest niggas from the south straight hoggin' with the galk
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
My fingers on my trigga and I'm gone off nine

[DJ Screw ad-libs][Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
We're toy soldiers

[H.A.W.K.]
See some love Keke, and some love Lil' O
Some love Pokey, and some love Big Moe
Hold up a second, I'm gon name a few mo'
E.S.G., Grace, Trae and Z-Ro
Mike D and 3, P-A-T
C-W-A-R-D, the DJ and me
S.U.C. soldiers we are united
For all you Screw Heads, it's time to get excited
The album's finally done, it's called The Take Over
I know y'all waited and waited, but now the wait's over
Lil' 3rd and Head, representing the Clover
And Clay from the Tre, it spells game over
See some are original, some afilliated
Some just know Screw, and sit around and say it
I'm an original, and got the balls to say it
Five star general, my skills will display it
Our Screw style, has been called it copied and traced
We bout to change that, and put it back in it's place
M.J. and Den, provided us the space
So we can congregate, and put boys in they place
Dressed in fatigues, the guns and boots laced
Ready to rapid fire, at any sound of bass
This hard shit we spitting, the world gon embrace
And see it's more to Houston, than just Flip and 'Face
C-Note and Red, y'all both got my blessings
It's not my fault, y'all didn't attend the sessions
Don't get me wrong, or be under the impression
I'm not dissing you boys, but let this be a lesson
We came together, we claimed together
It's now or never, let's get this change together
We're all Screw soldiers, everybody I named
Some soldiers locked up, some soldiers were slained
And Lil' Flip I thank you, for repping the name
You're afilliated now, the last link on the chain
Not trying to hate, or make it divisional
But the Screwed Up Click, was built around the originals
That's Fat Pat and Ke, Mike D and E
Poke', M-O-E and then there's me
H.A.W.K., them Boys from Bot-nay
We taking over this shit, get the fuck out our way

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Yeah, if somebody asks you if you S.U.C
And you got to wonder if you S.U.C., you ain't S.U.C. mayn
You feel me, just cause you know Screw
You ain't S.U.C., you know I'm saying
Niggas cry for this shit, niggas die for this shit mayn
These cats on this project, we strive for this shit mayn
The Take Over mayn, we finna make this shit happen mayn
Lil' Sam, Marv, y'all boys in the trenches with us mayn
The Take Over, S.U.C., H.A.W.K. five star general(*talking*)
It's one hundred - 3x
S.U.C., this how we do it mayn
The Take Over

[Hook - 2x]
It's one hundred, me and my niggas we gon keep it one hundred
Riding around in big Benz, getting blunted
Parking lot pimping, we sitting low up on them 20's
It's all one hundred, nigga

[Mike D]
I've been gone for a minute, look how the rules done changed
Since a few of these cake niggas, took position in the game
I guess it's true, all the real niggas dead or on lock
And the few that's still standing, done found another route
I don't play because out here, situation critical
Low down and pitiful, the streets'll get rid of ya
That OG talk, I'm like EF Hutch
Nigga pause and pay attention, like I'm strutting on buttons
Ain't no honor among thieves, no mo'
These lil' niggas'll get full of that dro, and run through your do'
Then have the nerve, like they done a lil' some'ing
And catch 'em in the county, they be sideways bumping
But believe me lil' daddy, your click ain't gon save ya
Jack me I'll jack back, send ya to your maker

[Lil 3rd]
Hundred percent, S.U.C. believe that
Choppers and calicoes, respond as feedback
You can tuck your tail back, now where your Clover G's at
Fifty in your head, fifty mo' where your knees at
Parking lot pimping, twenty spreading where your knees at
And the Clover, where the ghosts know in army fatigue hats
Split a nigga head, like I just skeed that
Screwed Up Click, cap that's where the best eat at
Southsi' for li', bitch nigga believe that
Respect, or it's drama involved when you see that
Boys shaken up, like a bad weed sack
Before I squab full of terror, make a nigga lean back

[Hook - 2x]

[Grace]
Fa sho I'm a hundred, I keep it gutter grimey gangsta
And money after cash, I blast on all prankstas
Give it to 'em raw, come real is all I know
Gon get it and come back with it, true blue head to toe
Seen it all heard it twice, five deuce like dice
In the do' slanging banging, putting it all in your life
1 double O fa sho, pack it up that's how it's coming
Candy dripping Davin's spinning, wood gripping trunk bumping
Rep the click until I fall, united and standing tall
Throw it up and rep it watch this, one hundred the Lord call
I'm a hundred with words, and I'm a hundred with birds
I'm a hundred with Miggity Mike D, and 3rd
Game won S.U.C., Greenstone real nigga
Certified with the game, Woodfair go getter

[Trae]
What the fuck, they thinking cuz
This problem here ain't no solving, 'til they be stinking cuz
Fresh off the chain a motherfucker better check theyself, shit they better go check they health
Slugs deep inside of they pack, fucked off I'ma bet they felt
Fuck a hundred, I'm a hundred and ninety-nine to the T
Asshole by Nature bitch, cause it define who I be
I heard some niggas in the game, ain't never heard of my set
May unload the back and make the bitch clap, while introducing my set
A.B.N., S-L-A-B and S.U.C. what I'm toting
And plus you need to pay attention, from this chrome that I'm toting
With thirty shots for thirty jocks, a dot and a hot Glock
In something that's sitting dropped, and tipping on plenty blocks

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)
Say uh, I'm out the beam nigga
Damn it feel good, to be free nigga
Check game nigga, uh

[Hook - 2x]
Thirty minutes off lock, and I'ma rock the block
I really don't care, if the beat hot or not
Just let me in the booth, so I can spit the truth
Are you ready motherfucker, I'm bout to come through

[Mike D]
S.U. motherfucking C
Who I be, Mike D
Miggity Mike D, Boss Hogg Corleon
The black Osama, with my chrome
Niggas better watch out, I promise that
Cause niggas ain't ready, cause I'ma handle that
Everything was talked about, Corleon
I'll come back to ya nigga, I'ma get millions
In the game, and get gone
I got my spanking from the Lord, and I'm bout to move on
Niggas, ain't ready though
Y'all ain't, ready though
We bout, to come through
Rolling with my niggas, in blue

[Grace]
G to the R-A-C to the E
Money over bitches, you niggas know me
I'm the game runner head hunter, scoping a beam
Me and Pimper give it to em, underground thoed king
By the name Mr. Chase, S.U.C. representer
Legendary game spitter, quickly bout to beginner
Got me touched by the Don, underground phenomenon
Back on the streets and in the mix, suckers high like Sadaam
I call it by back I want that, this underground mine
Incarcerated the calendar, now I'm back on the grind
Still sharper thinking smarter, screaming new world order
On a T and running best, from H-Town to the border
Transactions stacking still macking, and always 4-5 packing
Accummilating my cheese, like we all Greenbay packing
Got it Houston like the Texans, busting like Smith & Wessons
Kick up dust and raising hell, like cowards on old westerns
New millennium entrepreneur, bitch a mighty thug
The whole click hungry, and it's time to grub
Back on the streets and out the Penn, and it's time to get it
Sho' I'm fa sho with it, true to it and done did it
Like a booth I bring it back, spitting heat on tracks
Rip microphones burn out on chrome, counting nothing but stacks
Problem solved we in my lab, better lay heads flat
4-5 to the dome, now that's what I call crack cuz[Big Pokey]
It's a bunch of niggas, knocking my hustling
I'm on the grind going hard out the trunk, like Rocky when rushing
A empty clip, the only thang stop me from busting
When I roll nigga folding, it's not a discussion
Ask yourself this question, what's colder than Dina
It's a bunch of money on my den, fuck rolling a beamer
Go hard or go home, ho you know I'm a dreamer
With the heart to go and get it, how you know I'm a schemer
Sensei need a bad bitch, I'm looking for Trina
Put this ham in they yams, have her looking for Xena
We hit the do' like a battle ram, me and my team
I pop bottles every now and then, but me I'm a leaner
It's a small world, play pussy get fucked
Like a call girl, bout to fold it like a tall world
Fuck what they say-a, dog I'm some'ing like a playa
Bitches know me everywhere, motherfucker I'm all world

[Mike D]
I'm some'ing like a playa, some'ing like a pimp
Catch me at Papa Deauxxx, eating lobsters and shrimps
Y'all know who it is, and I'm right back at it
It's Boss Hogg Corleone, now come on ride with me daddy
Across the state line, I do it every time
It ain't hard to tell, how I'm on my grind
I'm like a Carl Smitty, in his prime time
But you can get it there, we riding for the same side
Then you done fucked up, gave me life again
MJ when I point em out, I want em all dead men
It's the Don, but every nigga in my click a boss
From Den Den to Lil' Duke, and Big H.A.W.K
Clay-Doe, 6-4, can't forget Bamino
Red D and Rhino, 3-2 and Danny Boy
C to the F to the E
Get your mind right trick, when you fucking with me
I'm all world, imagine just starving my baby girls
Niggas ain't ready, I'ma let the K hurl
You done fucked up, and let me grab a couple hundred
And in a minute, I'ma go on ahead and start stunting
For the summer, riding down on these cock-a-roaches
Man they shouldn't of talked down, on the Costra Nosta
Boss Hogg Corleone, that's me
The black Osama, taking over this biatch

[Chris Ward]
It's the M.O.B., H-O double G
S.U.C., raw ass nigga
I'm that ghetto ass, gutter gangsta
Gritty, Y.S.P. ass nigga
All these new comers, wanna be like me
I can't help it, y'all get off my D-I-C
That's from me to you nigga, stamp signed and sealed
Bout to let these niggas know, that I grind for scrill
All these niggas round here cap, like I don't shine for real
That's why I walk around, lookng like I just signed a deal
Got bout 40 on my chest, a dime on my wrist
And three quarts of that dime, on the same hand's fist
I make them all boppers, be like girl look at Chris
That nigga other hand, look like frozen yellow piss
Is this, what it's about
These lyrics that I spit out, is nasty once they get out
I contaminate the streets, I contaminate the booth
I contaminate the South, when I speak the truth
You might see in some'ing, looking like a nasty mustard stain
The top is butterscotch, and the guts is caine
All these motherfuckers asking, what's my name
It's C. Ward motherfucker, it's a must I came
My nust they hang, just like my Boss Hogg chain
You see I'm in it for the change, motherfuck the fame nigga

[E.S.G.]
Now guess who back and I'm hungry, I ain't aten my lunch
Always into something, bad apple out the bunch
Fuck a punchline, I'm throwing hate back like jabs
Knocking fake slim niggas, off the motherfucking slab
Hate nigga game I'ma take it back, wanna know how I got my stacks
Pablo came and gave me packs, stuck on mack and swang in Lacs
Blue and yellow stones, it's hard to look
Ice bucket on my chest, smelling like master cook
At the age 15, young guerilla in the jungle
Moving quarter ki's, and weed for my uncle
Call me Ashton Kutcher, bitch niggas I punk ya
Houston Tex call me Shrek, I'm a S.U.C. monster
Mike Jones had it wrong, see Screw is the Don
Whoever up next, only carried the baton
Put in city where I'm from, I was born in the booth
Had a murder charge in 9-5, I ain't scared to shoot
Candy red or blue coupe, I'm so executive
CEO status, you need a code where I live
I left the gates open, you cupcakes hoping
That you could rob the real Boss, I never leave my safe open
Leave your face smoking, I'm a gangsta to the fullest
A box of cigarillos, a new box of bullets
So when I pull it, you bitch niggas know the song
Me and Mike D, sipping purple and Patrone
Back back yep, in a 300 M's
Black, with the motherfucking all black rims
Known for serving fiends, straight dropping screens
These devils trying to clip my wings, call me Constantine
Bitch I be a pimp, I ain't slowing down
It's E and the Boss Hogg, bitch we hold it down
Yeah bitch niggas, you niggas all girls
E.S.G., Poke and Mike D yeah we all world

(*talking*)
Uh E.S.G., what's up MJ
Take Over year, right here
I got my nigga in here, Lil' 3rd
Bout to wreck this bitch

[Lil' 3rd]
I'm the Cloverland's finest, I ain't talking bout body-wise
Armageddon 16's on the rise, and body guards
Stones on my chest, change colors like models eyes
Blowing kush smoke, purple syrup slanging them powder pounds
Fired up down proof, and the slash is motorized
Can't let niggas see it, cause these boys is motomized
Style is mobster, West is saying C. Whoadie ride
E.S.G. and Mike D, pull up swanging the Rover wide
Claim Screwed Up Click, but you niggas not notarized
Tails stuck in they ass, when a nigga get notified
Fuck squashing the beef, cause Lil' 3rd fa sho to ride
That boy hunt pump shit, I can see it in both his eyes
K doing FED time, while I ain't thinking wise
Mean boxing game, AK and a shank and nine
King of Cloverland, it ain't nothing to compromise
Sweet as a honey bun, and you filled up with bunch of lies
If you a G, why you traumatized
A lil' fame got this nigga head, big as a Hummer tire

[Grace]
Put the chase all in your face, and rap at pace like them tommy guns
Busting your discussion, go-getter making suckers run
Pimping pens for ends, setting trends one of the ones
Day one dirt doer, underground like C and Bun
Bring it on, rep the click and stay standing strong
Calculator's what they call me, I'm the one that they counting on
Garunteed like F, underground funky like bad breath
Game runner give it to em, lay em down like bad health
We steady rapping for Screw, salute a flag that's blue
Until I'm gone it's on, like yellow west keep it true
Ya see I'm repping like I'm stepping, busting like auto weapons
That same boy G-R-A-C-E, got them Screw Heads recollecting
Another day another dub, Kalluminatti still riding high
Till the end and this the year, to tell them ho niggas bye-bye
I'm so for real with the skills, equipped and ready to kill
You flip like floozies in heels, rat and roaches catching steel[H.A.W.K.]
Po' out some liquor, for my nigga J.B
You lost your brother, but you still got me
Still got Ke', Manny, Shen and C-E-D
And our other brother, A.M.D
Can I please, have a moment of silence
For all my niggas, that's been lost in violence
And my niggas, from the Dead End Alliance
From the homies to the hoes, to my old school clients
A reminder, for my kin folk Chris
I really hate, you had to experience this
Sack will be missed, but also Sack will be pissed
If you don't, take care of your shit
To my Grandma, Elouise
To this day, the pain ain't eased
For you I be, and baby girl please believe
What you taught me, I'm teaching my seeds
And I sho', miss my homeboy Skully
I miss my buddy, my nigga use to keep that lovely
I reminisce, about Duke in the lab
And all the times, we use to smoke and laugh
A few words, for my baby for Heather
It's gon get better, your friendship will last forever
Don't ever say never, cause one day you'll be together
We gon make it, through the stormy weather
Can I please, have a moment of truth
To the parents, of the fallen troops
And new recruits, and 21 gun salutes
Y'all kids, are really the truth
One love, for my partner Big James
I love you mayn, I know that you love me the same
Mama Bam, I'ma miss you ma'am
My love, to the Louis Fam'

(*Quan - 2x*)
As day comes, and night falls
For the rest of our lives, we'll miss y'all
And even though life most go on, we still mourn
While I'm wishing, y'all were home

[Lil' Keke]
I got a purpose community service, never nervous
Jewelry and cars, it's all material and worthless
I tightened up my game, cause them white folks looking
And they wanna keep tabs, on the grams that I'm cooking
I lost my old man, 'fore we talked like grown men
He died of lung cancer, with them cigarettes and gin
My T. Lady got shook up, they say it's all genetic
The ratio of AIDS, keep rising so pathetic
I'm hurting inside, I'm trying to still keep a smile
Three time felon, because my young life was wild
Six feet deep, that's where them soldiers lay
We done po'd enough liquor, kneel down and pray
When the devil on your back, and he won't let go
Then you go to church Sunday, and you sit front row
I got stabbed in the back, but I kill with kindness
You breathe for a minute, take a moment of silence

(*Quan*)[Hook]
If you a hating ass nigga, back up (back up)
If you a broke ass nigga, back up (back up)
If you a fake ass nigga, back up (back up)
If you a do' popping nigga, back up (back up)
Now all my real ass niggas, what's up (what's up)
Now all my real ass bitches, what's up (what's up)
Now all my money making niggas, what's up (what's up)
Now all my money making bitches, what's up (what's up)

[Lil' O]
Know when to move orangatang, gorilla or ape
Could ever disrespect the Rat, and take food off my plate
I'm as official as a missile, hitting you in the face
That's from Texas fuck with O, to find you in a lake
So back up lil' daddy, you don't want no problems
Cause swisha sweet boys, don't revolve 'em evolve 'em
And any gangsta situation, guns'll solve 'em
So get your mind right, before you lose your noggin
See I ain't really going, for that ducking and dodging
That pushing and rassling, that weaving and bobbing
I just throw on a mask, like I'm Batman and Robin
And let the thang loose, and watch boys start jogging
You know how I do, man y'all see me mobbing
Broad on the right side, slurping and slobbing
Haters mean mugging, like we gotta rob 'em
I mean mug 'em right back, like is it a problem

[Hook]

[Bun B]
Now anyway Bun B can bring it, it's bout to be brought
Any way that you can catch it, fool it's bout to be caught
There's lessons to be taught, haters to be shot
Either by .50 Cal Mag, or that 30-30 out
You bought mo' than you can pay fo', now you got's to lay low
Kick do' to your mama house, pistol to your bay' bro
You think we came to play no, absolutely not
So tell me how to find your brother house, 'fore you get shot
You gave up all the game, and still got smacked with that pistol
The streets is screaming, the gangsta is back and official
They ask him what he love the most, bet he say a hater
Getting hit up with that heat, till he shake like a vibrator
And my state'd be the first, to lead the charge
That'll forward you bullets, off in your house and garage
Cause we them boys, that put the fire to the flame
Burn it down like Baghdad say fool, charge it to the game

[Hook]

[Benz]
Here them Queen boys come, and it's one for the record
It's one life one love, that got you lame's under pressure
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't gotta ask me no questions
Talking tough will get you lames, laid out on a stretcher
I don't fuck with the law, that got my dogs on lock
So this one for T-Bird, Mano, Baby and Brah
All that I got talk, I take what ya got
Since Mississippi Burning, see we play with that fire
True I stay with that fire, from the club to them streets
Boy I stay on my grind, from them drugs to them beats
Nigga stop lying, you ain't no thug boy you weak
When it come to that money, I'll wake you up out your sleep
Now all my Mississippi niggas blaze up, blaze up
Now all my Louisiana niggas boot up, boot up
Now all my T.S. niggas sick up, sick up
Now all my T.A. niggas get buck, get buck

[Hook]

Back up, what's up - 8x[Intro]
Bang-bang, I shot you down bang-bang
You hit the ground bang-bang
That awful sound, bang-bang
I use to shoot you down

[H.A.W.K.]
Bang-bang, all that remains is a splattered brain
Chizzle your frame, and blood gushing from you veins
We bust them thangs, that rearrange your whole frame
And inflict pain, like a venomous snakes fangs
H.A.W.K. is the nickname, H.A.W.K. therefor is sick mayn
And when I aim, just get low like Ying-Yang
And if you're in my range, while I'm in my Range
You better switch lanes, and dash like Dame
I'm like John Wayne, without a saddle mayn
I tear up thangs, the force of a hurricane
You think it's a game, then go on let your nuts hang
Call my bluff, and you gon see your cuts mayn
Blood on your Chucks mayn, I don't give a fuck mayn
I'm not young, but I do want the bucks mayn
Fire up the dutch mayn, fired in the clutch mayn
And just remember, anybody can be touched mayn
I'm like Big Daddy Kane, ain't no half stepping
Cause I keep a weapon, and it's a Smith-N-Wesson
I keep my heat on me, like I.D
Bust a few shots, you hooked to an IV
So don't try me, or you will die G
And one thang bout me, is I don't lie G
Don't jump fly G, or try to act crazy
Cause that will only have you, lying under daisies
Mama screaming out, what happened to my baby
Our sympathies go out, to your T-Lady

[Chris Ward]
You see I grind full time, and I rhyme on my off days
In a red patent leather colored Coupe, and the top is soft grey
All you hating ass haters, best to back up off me
If not I know where to do it, my Glock faulty
And round here, man they call me C dot W
If I ain't got no love for ya, ain't no sense in mugging ya
I just pull out, and toss a couple slugs at ya
With a warranty, that nine out of ten'll end up in ya
I got a aim, so superb when I spit
It's like my flow pattern, have you ever heard when I spit
I'm so correct with it, I must connect with it
Hit your chest back head, and then your neck with it
See I'm the truth lil' dude, just ask these niggas
They could be driving in they ride, and I could be walking
Ten miles behind, and I still pass these niggas
Like a bad accident, I'm bout to crash these niggas
At the lyrics cemetery, is where they gon have to stash these niggas
And yeah-yeah, it's C-Ward the B.Gizzle of the click
That'll dump a clip at ya, till I hurt or burn a click
Click-click-click, uh-huh
And reload, and do it all over again my nigga
Click-click-click (blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka)
Click-click-click (blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka)
Click-click-click (blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka-blucka)(*talking*)
Yeah, West-West y'all
It's the Fat Rat with the Cheeze, Lil' O nigga
Did you miss me nigga, hey

[Lil' O]
It's been, a long-long time
But you waited patiently, like a long-long line
Now I'm back with the crack, and the stracks on the grind
Got the jugs from the drank, and a trunk full of nines
If you need it then I got it, cause believe a nigga bought it
Just to sell it back to you, trying to see a lil' profit
If you ask me if I ball, if I feel the need to cop it
And it cost a hundred thou', best believe that I can drive it
So you do the math, nigga do the analysis

Lil' O certified, bet you ain't nigga
But these rocks, on my wrist'll make a nigga think nigga
Like man, I ain't hustling right
How the fuck that boy shine, like the sun in the night

That if you stare up at his chest, it'll fuck up your sight
But if you jack, thinking that you gone luck up tonight
You better know the P-89, ain't nothing nice
In fact, nigga I got choppers that can cut up your pints

And I'd box for my pride, you can't handle the kid
Nigga win lose or draw mayn it is what it is, hey

I say the hustle plus those that hate, is what entice me
You wanna know mo' bout C. Weez, let me give you some advice G
Me low Caddy coupe, top look ricey
Cherry red gold, and all the stones is icey
I dropped out for this shit here, it's kinda pricey
Plus majors keep calling around here, trying to price me
Now when I rap, I don't speak nicely
For the fact, the way I act is just kinda sheisty
I like my women fine, they attitude is spicey
Hot at all times, like some crooked trick dice be
I'm smooth like Avon, better yet like Rayon
I'm the veteran rookie, why else you think I'm playing
It's pussycat niggas like you, that we prey on
And the jewelry box I got, look like it's sponsored by Crayon
I got the whole, world tipsy
Leaning off the shit that I drink, except my name's not J-Kwon
I'm the B.G. of this click, and I'm holding it down
For those, who been representing it since day one
And that's why, I do what I do
For the late great DJ Screw, whoo
Fronting around here, will get your neck clipped off
I ain't bout taking no shorts, or no rip off's
I'm bout to button up the top, and straight tip off
Like a scratched up c.d., I'm about to skip off
Track down here, and use to we whip soft
In the hardcore crack you get it, we whip soft
And I don't know if you understand, or is you feeling my slang
Though it's not Lil' Wayne, I'm bout my cash money mayn
You see I'm fresh like Mannie, with a three story compressed
Into a one story flat, being built right now you understand me

[Clay-Doe]
Hold up, before and through
Get the motherfucking lighters back lit, for DJ Screw
Niggas don't know, bout that H-O-U
It's like the whole 4-4-2, is hating on you
Who walk identicle twins, to his talk black
And got identicle Glocks, in his raw black
Living murder you heard of, but of no dirt crack
And we serving them birds boy, we don't know how to act
I heard from the 3rd, got no problems with that
Matter of fact, let's get to the bottom of the facts
Catch Doe-shis, in the bottle with some crack
Hand painted from the top, to the bottom of the pack
Smoking that la-la, till the bottom of the sack
Extended clip, hanging out the bottom of the Mack
Trying to jack get hit, with the bottom of the gat
Choo-choo look fools, at the bottom of the track
Who-do's to 22's, on the bottom of the Lac
Bitch licking from the top, to the bottom of my tap
From the bottom of the rack, hit the bottom of the cat
And relax, and get that mind back on all do's
Take the Volvo, with the cargo
In the car do', rain daddy Wells Fargo
I got hands 'cross the land, like a bar code
A look in mirror, looking for some convo
Am I the realest, if I ain't nigga I don't know
You don't know, I'll tell you Doe
The Don, from the 3 Ward
Young C. Ward, and my S.U.C. squad bitch(*talking*)
Take Over, the album coming this summer baby
2005 get ready for it baby, they said it wouldn't ever happen
It's going down right now, young gun Po-Yo, Lil' O
Mike D, 3-2, breathe-breathe-breathe (just blaze)

[H.A.W.K.]
I breathe with ease, just like I throw them B's
Puff on trees, like Fat Rat I chase the cheese
I'm in the matrix, like Keanu Reeves
Equipped with thieves, and G's with college degrees
Please believe, our franchise better than Steve's
We push V's, with tops down feeling the breeze
Your main squeeze, is on these N-U-T's
On her knees, and she's aiming to please
Cause I'm riding in a Coupe, the color of mustard
Inside custard, one deep ain't no room for busters
Inhale exhale, and spit flawless raps
And I'm gon give these boys hell, till my lungs collapse
And if you ashmatic, don't start no static
I be hanging erratic, the situation could get tragic
So take heed, or motherfuckers bound to bleed
With your homeboy yelling, my nigga please

(*talking*)
Y'all niggas better breathe, y'all niggas better breathe
Y'all niggas better breathe, Say Den check game my nigga

[Mike D]
Your boy right back home, y'all been missing the real
Corleon gon give it to ya, get ya crunk like a X pill
This for the real, don't let them fakes sing along
It's the Boss Don-Dadda, Michael Corleone
Pimp out this, not a simp out this
Get my gangsta strut on, when I limp like this
I'm certified, mafia strings laced up
Keep a bad game face down, while I wake's up
Y'all cats face up, I'm back in the do'
Harder than ever, cause hard times make a real nigga grow
I done seen in triple X's, making hope niggas fold
The fake gon be fake, and the real gon roll on
I don't know no other way, for this Hogg named Corleone
I ain't had a damn thang, probably all my life
Shit I struggled, but that's my life
Yeah you better check it nigga, that's my life

(*talking*)
Corleone, CMB-S.U.C. (hold up)
(you know, you-you-you know, what)

[Grace]
Game runner after cash, execute and put it down
Rhyme ripper syrup sipper, Screwed Up in H-Town
You know my name and my game, how I do what it do
Legendary Dub maker, got the game from Screw
Pimp pens and bust guns, transact with coupons
Dues paid and stripes earned, my nigga the blue Don
Get it right go all night, I'm a true block bleeder
Dat Boy Grace from the Fare, certified with the heater
Pick a point you phony buster, bad decision paper stacking
Keep it cracking steady macking, transacting and bad ac'ing
Hoover Groover that'll do ya, make the Ruger run through ya
Catch a rat in my cheese, watch them hollows pursue ya
I got it all on my mind, paid the cost to shine
S.U.C. day one nigga, it's a constant grind
I hit the booth and breathe, kill a track with ease
L.O.S., Den and Grace true Southwest G's(*Jadakiss*)
(I'll be by your side) General
We got these niggas, fucking cock-a-roaches
Wanna go to war, a-haaaa

[Big Pokey]

When I sleep one eye closed, one eye cracked
Pitbull in the crib, keep one eye back
When Hector come around, I don't run out black
I'm right (by your side), when you need me nigga
I walk by faith, let the Lord lead me nigga
You can even be a hard, or a easy nigga
Rap need me, like George need Weezy nigga
I'm (by your side), whether right or wrong
Niggas choke under pressure, like you lighting a bone
If a nigga try to test, yeah I'ma get this nigga touched
While I'm at the crib layed back, writing a song
I'm (by your side), like a guard and a tackle
Caught a flight to N.Y., went hard in the Apple
Don't be mad cause your broad, in the car with a rapper
Think I'm slow you don't know, I'm the nigga to be right

[Hook]
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side, by your side
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side


[H.A.W.K.]
Like Siamese twins, from boys to men
Like nine, sitting next to ten
Like Mexicans, waiting for that work to come in
The best of friends, everybody think we kin
Cause I'm (by your side), like a nextdo' neighbor
If I know nothing else, I know Christ my savior
Sharp as a razor, even through bad behavior
He was still by my side, like a two-way pager
He's still (by your side), like a passenger seat
Or some peanut butter cuts, in a fo' do' Fleet
Like bass to a beat, I'll make ya complete
Like a couple cuddled up, in between the sheets
I'll be (by your side), even toughest of times
What's yours is mine, every quarter nickel and dime
I spit these rhymes, so that we both can shine
Although sometimes, you may cross the line
I'm still (by your side), like Luke to Vaketsky
Hockey to Wayne Gretzky, or a fly and his pesky
And times to test me, the situation can get messy
I can kill you sometimes, but God won't let me
Cause I'm (by your side), like May to June
Or an unborn child, in a mother's womb
Or a minister, marrying a bride and groom
Or the stars in the sky, next to the moon I'm still

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
(by your side) like 4-5 holsters
From the jail mug shots, to the c.d. posters
I'm a bad boy, nothing like that Martin and Will
From the streets of steel, where they train boys to kill
So I'm (by your side), like the Secret Service
We some three time felons, white folks are nervous
Credit plus capitas, that ass monopoly
I know your every move, like the Paparazzi
Cause I'm (by your side), like a million man march
Pass the microphone, like the Olympian torch
It's back to S.U.C., we still holding it down
In the paint posted up, for the next rebound
Cause I'm (by your side), like Jordan and Scottie
Like H.A.W.K. and Fat Pat, or like Poke' and Lotti
When your mind get weak, and your body is tired
You can open up your blind, cause I'm sitting outside right

[Hook](*talking*)
They thought, we was down and out
Nigga we up like a motherfucker, on feet
Believe that punk, Fat Rat said that

[Lil' Keke]
I'm in the water trying to swim, but my chance is slim
I was born not to fold, and let it swallow me whole
I cross these H-Town streets, but I've been ten toes in
How many independent rappers, really eating off their ends
And I rap vicious, you false and perticious
I'm true to my riches, it's money over bitches
And I'm down never out, so I came with a new plan
Now I'm on a fast break, laying it with my left hand
I play the game day for day, cause it's costing
These niggas like snails in the street, and they salty
I watch 'em melt, as the pain is felt
And I go fishing in the pond, with the cards I'm dealt
We entertain for a living, S.U.C. on fire
I'm the teflon Don, independent empire
Now the fo' do' truck, is 24's with buttons
South Park-Herschelwood, I done came from nothing yeah

(*talking*)
S.U.C., we might be down
W ain't never out, believe that

[H.A.W.K.]
I spit verses, like M-16's
And pounce on top of niggas, like trampalenes
It's just in my jeans, flows through my bloodstream
I must fulfill, Fat Pat's ghetto dream
I'm in between, a rock and a hard place
I spit 16's, that rock over hard bass
And when you see my face, you know you seen the best yet
A seasoned vet, a beast like Garnett
I ain't wanted yet, but that won't stop a nigga
Get in my way, I'ma break you off proper nigga
I'm grinding mayn, trying to make my name bigger
I wanna leave the game, on top of Jigga
I know niggas hating, but those are my aspirations
I'm on a battlefield, with scars and asserations
My mind elevating, my flow is ice cold
I got the heart of T.O., in the Super Bowl
It's fourth and goal, so please give me the rock
I wanna certify my place, up in hip-hop
And when my shit drop, I'ma squash all talk
The next name you'll be screaming, is Big H.A.W.K

(*talking*)
Mo'fuckers act, like they don't know what time it is
It's our time to shine, get the fuck up outta here

Watch what ya saying pimp, when ya greeting me boy
Cause I'm a young veteran, you ain't seen what I saw
Mack match bust heads, razor cuts to the jaw
42 pounds and 64, bricks in the drawer
Clit hitting getting head, if I ain't playing it raw
And shorty I don't just want head, I wanna skeet in your jaw
I want ya to imitate, that old drunk at the bar
Cause they ain't wanna fuck with me, till they think I'm a star
Got stress in my head, for my brother in Bed's
And my cousin D-5, they all locked in the FED's
I feel it woulda never happened, if I had mo' bread
They put 'em all on my back, but I just got two legs
I guess I'm sick of brainstorming, I got down two heads
Trying to scramble to plug along, like I cook to eggs
And I never kiss ass, just to make no ends
I'ma keep it one hundred, as the world spins yeah(*talking*)

We in them Hummers, it's just like that
And when we pull them Hummers out, hoes think it's Iraq move around bitch

[Lil' Keke]
It's Mobstyle, and you know we ride on them wankstas
C.M.G., that's them Custom Made Gangstas
I represent for my block, the Wood
And you know it's all good, take it back to the hood
If these niggas talking down, I bust em in they face
I wouldn't give a damn, I keep the Glock on my waist
I place em on the ground, it be under place
It's the Young Don, bout to give a nigga taste(*talking*)
Run the tape treal, I know when I'm in the zone
We gangstas right chea, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Say uh uh say uh, I'm so gangsta
So motherfucking gangsta, I'm so gangsta look at me wow

[Mike D]
I'm gangsta gangsta, Southside playa
Put my pimp down like P-A-T, a super ho layer
It's return of the rapper, slash the hood fella
Looking for a rat, to get her groove back like Stella
Still got a sack of that A-1, good yella
With a baby Glock, ready to rock-a-bye fellas
Hit me on the cella, ain't a damn thang changed
I take a brick, make that ho in the two thangs
How I get down my cats, sit him down
Pull up in your city, and shut that ho down
I'm like Baby, I got that work for 2-0
Hugging the block daddy, kidnap do'
Drop top Cadillacs, I ride with mink rugs
Compatible to none, cause I'm a distinct thug
You new cats don't move me, the O.G. back
I got love in A-T-X, all the way to the flats
A lil' some'ing in Alabama, some in Arkansas
Memphis Tenn. down with me, my folks in Lake Charles
Sir Corle' day one, don't you know S.U.C
Get your mind right brick, when you fucking with me

[Hook]

Gangsta walk with me, gangsta walk with me
Gangsta walk with me, gangsta walk with me
Gangsta walk with me, gangsta walk with me

[Trae]
Gangsta walk with me, gangsta talk with me
Cause blood a 24, gon set it off with me
I'm a G out A.B.N., when I be walking my turf
Real is floating through my blood, since the day of my birth
No set tripping, but see I rep the blue and the grey
On the side they call the West, and niggas moving they gay
Full speed but moving slow, cause ain't no time for no case
But if the laws hit the block, it's always time for a chase
On a hog to Pensacola, Little Rock and the boot
N.Y. on down to Cali, I'ma rep like a troop
H-Town is where I'm from, ain't no mistaking my claim
Red dots on top of chrome, ain't no mistaking my aim
You see I walk it like I talk it, live it how I display it
Pop the trunk on 84's, garunteed that I'ma wave it
Every motherfucking day, and that's the way this shit go
And if you hate the way I do it, that's the way this shit flow

[Hook](*talking*)
Yeah, what I gotta do to get this paper
I want the paper bitches, man S.U.C
What do I gotta do to get that paper
What I gotta do, to get that paper
Tell me what I gotta do to get paper
All I wanna do is get that paper

[Mike D]
All I had to do was shift my stick, and switch my bitch
It's like oh my God, the kid back in the mix
Funny how a no good ho, will bring you down
Put the worse on a nigga, cause y'all a playa curse
Fuck a ho, drag off in the Lexus
Make a nigga respect this, Break-A-Ho Texas
City with no pity, hoes hustle out they titty
Knuckle up pitch rocks, peep out it and go get it
Snatch a rack run up pack, our packs hold a gat
Hit the highway withcha, stash a half in a cat
Sick stand-up cats, run with stand-up hoes
If they bar mix packs, it be like there he blows
Off in the wind, let the GTO scratch the street
Behind tint getting bent, with Z-Ro in the deck
Something jazzy dumping ashes, bout to give me slow neck
Y'all know what it is, the same fo' came back

[Lil' Keke]
I've been through everything, but I still persevere
Bout to go live in 0-5, I'm still right here
Oh yeah it's still my year, cause that talk is cheap
By my lone' who really want me, man I ride one deep
Got my hustle right paper tight, don't matter to me
I can write a 16, or process me a ki
The streets a motherfucker, man they'll swallow ya whole
Pack it up wrap it up, nigga I'm ready to roll
Fuck these niggas and these figgas, I stay ready to rock
Got killas with twin Glocks, if you ready to plot
It's the Take Over, I'm known as Lil' Ke
A certified guerilla, is courtesy S.U.C
Bang-bang chop-chop, man this shit don't stop
We the underground kings, it's eight dollas a pop
These niggas be talking shit, and I'm hot no doubt
But they can suck my dick, until the cum shoot out

[Grace]
If you don't know what it was, just here to show what it is
Bitch I'm the game runner head hunter, wrecking for years
It's the boy that put it down, from S.U.C. H-Town
Southwest go-getter, Hoovergroove and to clown
Take bitches and split fame, love to grip on grain
Southside of H-Town, where they cook up caine
Chop-chop on dub 4's, swang and bang 8-4's
Drop top and blow dro, or po' it up out of 4's
Straight medicated elevated, one hundred afilliated
The underground funk King, is highly anticipated
Pimp then pen and give it to em, I'm a Grey Tape soul
You can't break the damn fool, showcasing skills that's thoed
Fuck a world Southwest G, another day another thug
Day one true to it, till this day kill scrubs
Spell it out you know my name, G-R-A-C-E
S.U.C. V-E-T, that's till I D-I-E(*talking*)
You know yeah uh-huh, you know
That's right uh-huh, what

[Hook - 2x]
(what you doing), bumping grinding on that Interstate 10
(who you with), pints pounds and a couple chickens
(what we gon do), I'm trying to hustle and stack up some wins
I gotta sell the shit we stole, and then do it again

[Grace]
Compressed pounds sealed pints, and A-1 chickens
Back on the streets on the road again, bleeding down I-10
Syrup cookies and cheese, plus I got bags full of weed
And for you niggas that want it, I got that lean bopping t's
Taking trips on money flipped, it's like highway robbery
Me and that L.O.S. get gone, chasing our currencies
Hit your town in the hood, them Air Force 1's get to stepping
Cash money brothers break boys, on the grind packing weapons
Score it whip it and ship it, you know go-getters go get it
Buy it low and sell it high, then come back cold with it
Paper chasing pyrex shaking, deadly faces we making
We got it all at wholesale, clientele we taking
Making moves for the cash, thinking first so we last
Fuck with your boy and get it good, I got a deal for your ass
Nina pack for 45, 5-PT left 25
Throw in a pound for fo' hundred, making sho' you satisfied

[Hook - 2x]

[Mike D]
No need to ask, who on that highway booking em
Sunday catch me cowboy hat, with a cowboy look and uh
Duely trucker, yeah Corle' a mo'fucker
Two hands fried up, thirty grand tied up
Ain't taking losses, (for what) I'm too on
Don't play with my money lil' daddy, I'm too grown
Plus that brown trucker, still bring em by the 20's mayn
Reggie by the hundreds mayn, track stars to run it mayn
Y'all ain't talking money mayn, let's talk figgas mayn
Listen when I talk and hear them, tell the difference mayn
Half of em don't know, fifty 20's is a thousand
Or simple shit like don't sleep with dope in your houses
You a 80 baby, I've been on since the 90's
Hugging these blocks, when your mama wouldn't let you round it
Plus I know the, front and back way to I-10
If the whole thang hit the flats, think I ain't gon win shit

[Hook](*talking*)
Yeah it's gutter nigga, Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze nigga
Southwest nigga, Screwed Up Click nigga whoa

[Lil' O]
This is mean rap, hop out of the Houptie burn a nigga flee the scene rap
Chop a nigga head off with, call it guillotine rap
Motherfuck you pussy, if you ain't about your green stacks
Lil' O's a hustler, what
This is for my niggas, with the coedine in the cup
And my hustlers in the trap, moving rocks up on the cut
Money over bitches nigga, keep your money up
Motherfuck a piece of pussy, they bop when they see the truck
On 24's, nigga I got plenty hoes
If you want a bunch of bitches, nigga get you plenty do'
They come with the territory, nigga wanna hear a story
Bout how a real nigga named O, came to glory
First thing first I got superdrive, dog I'm not your average dude
Lil' bro, I'm super live
Hopped out the Lac, on 4's like Super Fly
Play a nigga like a ho, I garuntee do or die you got me fucked up
See me in the big Benz, getting sucked up
By a yellow hair under there, love to swallow nut
If I shoot or miss, then I'm gonna follow up
I got killas on the payroll, don't make me call 'em up
It is not a thang, come through popping thangs
Dog there's a price on your head, and I drop the change pussy
No I'm not a joke, I'm not broke
Man I let the thang smoke, I'll leave ya dead like the Pope don't push me nigga

[H.A.W.K.]
Ten-nine-eight-seven-six-five-fo'
That was the countdown, to some monstrous flow
You already know, I got monstrous do'
And the ice that I rock, got a monstrous glow
6-4 weighing, and a 2-84
And I throw a blow, that'll knock 'em all to the flo'
Remarkable, not your average dude
And I spit shit, that makes parpalegics screwed
All H.A.W.K. do, is make strategic moves
And the flames that I spit, are so hard to refuse
If you confuse, peep the context clues
Or was it like Larry Hughes, on my P's and Q's
I'm bolt to this screw, with a pair of pliers
And most of these rappers, are compulsive liars
Claiming they the best, since Hov' retired
They need to be comedians, like Richard Pryor
Show me the money, like Jerry McGuire
And I'll spit a flow, that set the booth on fire
You might of seen my posters, stickers and fliers
I'm the five-star general, of the Screw empire
You the type of nigga, that's under required
Cause skills like mine, are really hard to acquire
Pouring up a deuce, it'll piece the pie-a
You just gotta admit it, the kid's on fire

[Big Pokey]
These other playas hurt, they be hugging my belly
And a nigga tired of eating, peanut butter and jelly
I treat mic's like confeddi, clock punching is steady
Don't have to rap everyday, cause my Columbians is heavy
Go with it I'ma fade it, if the money is heavy
Bet the title too line 'em up, Hummers and Cheves
I like my money like lettuce nigga, crispy and green
Conversation for a bitch, make her piss in her jeans
A grown can't be chilling, with no chicken or teen
Even if she thick in the jeans, thick in between
Already found my queen, and she gave me a princess
Soon to be a nigga bride, watch the backside slide
Watch the backside glide, when I'm working the three-wheel
Sensei Mob boss, M.O.B. real
Girl get your hair did, peticure and a refill
In the morning, I'ma check up on my nigga and be real
For my niggas on lock, Black Magic D.Hill
Nonproof, Hard Plack, Erik and P. Real
Nigga need three shields, and a vest to put on
Go on and stunt, I got a clip that'll shoot for a month
Grinding, everything shining in the diamond
Tee-tiller, block in the wind like it's a limon
Fuck consignment, we ain't giving you shit
S.U.C. means suck my dick, motherfucker
