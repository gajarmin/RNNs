[Verse 1: Scoob]
This here for the motherfuckin record
Here we here we here we go, here we here we go
Can I can I can I kick a motherfuckin flow
Chitty chitty bang bang, I chitty bang bang
Motherfuckin niggas can't hang
Well oh no, look at the cloud, it's gonna rain
But I don't give a fuck I'm letting niggas know they can't hang
Don't give me no lip, don't give me no backtalk, yeah break North
Don't make me get my gun and blow your motherfuckin head off
Once again, niggas know my style, God damn it
Unless it's on the cut so give me the mic and watch me slam it
Hard like Shaquille, oh you better kneel
When you see me comin, Big Scoob got em runnin
Sex when I flex I catch wreck on the world tour
With dough in my pockets big like the Biscuits, in CB4
Set up a contest, I'm coming, I'm taking the dough
They wouldn't pick you even if you had a afro
So don't try me, you better walk by me
I'll do you like the first part in Menace II Society
Like Cypress Hill, yo, I'm insane
I'll shoot a hole in your toe
I'll make you jump like the House of Pain
Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang
Niggas can't hang, niggas can't hang
Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang, motherfuckin niggas can't hang

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
We gonna do it like this
Anytime you're ready, check it:
I got seven Mack-11's, about eight 38's
Nine 9's, ten MAC-10's, the shit never ends
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lambsbread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns,I make number runs
I give mc's the runs, drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK,I slay from far away
Everybody hit the d-e-c-k
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Mateo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my god, I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin', smackin' babies at their Christenin'

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Yeah, where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw up your motherfuckin middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this
I thank the lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us from a MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
A straight soldier, buckin at the bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug life, motherfucker crime pays
Let the cops put their lights on: chase me nigga!
Zig zaggin' through the freeway: race me nigga!
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw

[Verse 4: Shyheim]
Yo, this goes out to everybody from Staten Island
{*ah Mister Cee, and you don't stop*}
Yo, times is getting hard, word is bond, I swear to God
I even got caught trying to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a rebel without a pause
I never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parking lot
In front of my building I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigger then tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

[Kane] This how we gonna do it, hold up Cee, aiyyo, let's try this
[Shy] Staten Island in the motherfuckin house!
Wassup, Wu-Tang Clan in here or what?

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Now what's the bullshit niggas been saying
Dont try to act like Martin now with that "I was just playin!"
No need to grieve now on, now that the beef is on
Uhh!! Oh yeah motherfucker, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap don't meant that you're catching wreck with me
Step to this I'll give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one nigga that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle, I gots to have it, 'lest you're gonna rob me
Like they did, Whittaker when he fought Chavez
Cause when it comes to going against Kane rappin
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nothing happenin
Non-resistible, non compatible
I'm not saying I'm the best, I'm just saying I'm fuckin incredible
And let's just get one more thing understood
If I fart on a record, trust me nigga, that shit gon' sound good[Scratches: DJ Premier]
Bust a move, we show and prove

[Verse 1: Scoob]
Ha ha, hey hey, laugh now nigga
My man's right behind you, Kane pull the trigger
I don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real
And I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon' rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hair and you still can't get no part
You couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playing cards
But if I got beef then it's time for code red
My gun is like a ho, it be taking mad niggas to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join the army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from? England, you somebody great?
You burning Scoob, "I don't think so mate"
I got the style that get you open like a bag of smoke
I'll have your friends saying "Ah man, that shit is dope"
Leave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone
And play like E.T. and phone your black ass home
Yo Sauce, if you're down with the groove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Verse 2: Sauce]
Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
How you got dope like Sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
NBA style, fantastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight
I write left-handed cause I like to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win lose or draw, I'm booking whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie
If I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty
Sucking and lucking, hey, niggas I'm ducking, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So Shyheim, if you're down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Verse 3: Shyheim]
I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a Metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killing
When I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
Cause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia
If your shit stinks I'mma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from Cali son
My jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the F in effin foul
The Rugged Child lock shit down like Rikers Isle
And got more girls than a trailer load with Shabba
More Super than Cat, I'm the punani Don Dada
So Big Daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Verse 4: Big Daddy Kane]
Now tell me who is the man?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And stepping to me, thinking I can be touched?
Not even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, Jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What I just shown ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leaving rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me
But with that speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistable, non-competible
No No No I'm not saying I'm the best
I'm just saying I'm fucking incredible
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So Jay-Z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Verse 5: Jay-Z]
One checking it two, checking it three
Check out the J, check out the A, check out the Y, check out the Z
Aight G!
I'm breaking MC's up like EPMD
And these nuts if you rappers trying to see me
I'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow
I've been in it running a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal
Uhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggas can't fuck with
The, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eating me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like Prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it
Till you try it, once you start, you can't stop it
I'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be
Between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound
I know you loving the way it's, goin down baby
So Ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya
Get on the mic and show and prove

[Verse 6: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Come on
Wu-Tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a flick, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream "Ow!"
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like "Well god damn what's the recipe?"
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
She says "Go ask your goddamn father!"
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas think they all that, yo, that shit is G
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame
How many enemies wanna claim the name
Of Ason, who carries on like a manager
Yo! Sounds fly, right?
Danger!!!*Report set to "Co-Defendant" beat*

[Reporter]
Shyheim, the youngest member of the Wu-Tang Clan, was jumped at
A Staten Island club, and his face still bares the scar

*car spinning out of control and crashing*
*beat drops*
*multiple gunshots*
"And you will know my name is the lord..." -] Samuel L. Jackson

[Big L]
Shyheim, yeah
Corleone
Uh-huh, check it out

Y'all niggas be walkin the streets, iced out
Not knowin the walk, so put the price out
To get you stuck and punch ya lights out
Or catch ya car in the night and snatch ya wife out
And beat the ho up if you don't give the dough up
You got me pissed off, frontin and ya whole clique soft
If ya had ya Roly on, I might cut ya wrist off
Then lick off, and slide ya bitch off, punk
I hope ya ready for the kick-off
Ya flankin niggas and I'm gettin rich off
I done sold coke, sold crack, sold smoke, sold smack
Now I wanna go plat', can I get a soul clap
It ain't no part a time out, once I climb out
The garbage can, wit 2 nines out, and blow ya spine out
Oh I got you cats by a long-shot, every song hot
1-3-9 and Lennox is a strong block
I left enough a y'all stinkin
What the fuck was y'all thinkin?
My shit's tight, nigga, I spit writin
Yo, what?

[Shyheim]
Young outlaw, the state wanna get rid a me
I'll probably die from the death penalty
Y'all analog, Shyheim I keep it digity
I'm not pussy so I don't need security
Like Big L, I'm MVP on the street
I did wet more people than the pool and the beach
So be easy, or I'll expose you like shock TV
O.G., that's why they put me in a movie
Don't screw me, cuz if I punch you in ya face
You'll probably try and sue me, and take me to Judge Judy
Look me in my eyes cuz ya handshake don't fool thee
Stapleton Staten Islander, the name's marked on the calender
Ain't no screwin off a silencer, uh-uh

*gunshots*
"And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
And furious anger on those who attempt to poison and destroy
My brothers, and you will know my name is the lord." -] Samuel L. Jackson

[Big L]
If you got somethin to say, then cough it out
Cuz niggas be wantin beef, but when you pull out
The heat they ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about?
You was just frontin, now it ain't nuttin
Ain't that somethin? I should start bustin anyway
And put one a you punks in the ground
Y'all niggas be killin me with y'all faces round, jumpin around
Like you scarin us, not even
Cuz me and Shy' gon' be some thugs til we stop breathin

"My name is the lord..." -] Samuel L. Jackson

[Shyheim]
Niggas be actin like they hoodlums
Until they get shot up or locked up, now they Bloods and Muslims
In the Wu, benz bang em like a Benz, touch kid nuttin thin
Put his ear to his chin
I gotta win and beat this game of dyin rich and old
Cuz these playa-hatin niggas wanna block my gold
It's untold like the truth, they thirsty for my juice
But when I let loose, have them jumpin out they boots[Verse 1 ]
Nowadays you gots’ ta walk the street and watch your back
Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowin’ how to act
They always pull the Glock when somebody rocks a knot
And if they get shot they often snitch to the cops
Now tell me this ain’t livin foul
She just had a baby child and she’s back to sellin’ cracks vials
On the Ave cause she’s addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass
But honey-dip dont wanna listen cause she’s in no position
Now nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then comittin’ suicide

[Hook 2x]
June Luva:
Hey Yo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing
From hookerin' to drug slang (repeat 2)

Verse Two (Shyheim):
Times is gettin' hard, word is bond I swear God
I even got caught tryin' to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, A rebel without a cause
Ain't nevah had a good Christmas so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil’ town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin' lot
In front of my buildin' I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

Hook

Hey Yo, get a load of this guy you know the Mr. Hard-y
He the one who talk about gats but ain't' bustin nobody
He speaks the name game so he can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame but his mom said he gang bang
But his rep was hi-tech in the projects
Pulled his knuckle-jacks so he got mad respect
The niggas in hoodies packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and at nine was dopin’ and coked
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few brothers, drug dealers, most of them fugitives

Hook x5[Intro: Stack Bundles (L.E.O.)]
Squaaad up, yeah, them Riot Squad boys in the building (for ???)
Scrappy, you know I fucks wih you boy (alright)
I show hood love all the time, if I heard of you nigga, ha

[Chorus: L.E.O. (Stack Bundles)]
First things first, you niggas don't put in no work
Your name don't rang (Never heard of you, keep bangin)
You know that you non violent, now that you out the closet
Your name's what? (Never heard of you, keep bangin)
I hear you niggas talkin, I swear you talk a good one
What hood you from? (Never heard of you, keep bangin)
Ya'll niggas don't know what's street, ya'll niggas don't know what's beef
Who's ya OG? (Never heard of you, keep bangin)

[Stack Bundles]
Brick through the Porsche window, ain't that some shit (oh)
And I wasn't even pissed, I got a couple more whips (for real)
Gotta a line on em, my young'ns gave me their names and
I never heard of these niggas, tell em to keep bangin (hah)
When I'm in town, I'm soo whoo'n in my neighborhood (nine trey)
When I'm in Comp-town, I get it crackin in the neighborhood (Eazy!)
Whatever borough, city or state that I hang in (what)
Knowin what gorillas and killas are really bangin (chea)
My name always is heresay, but you never hear em say (um)
Anything that's even remotely moving (fo real)
Queens to Spring Bling, I'm supposed to be moving (fo real)
I'm bilingual, but the money still talks so fluid
You in baby drama crib, what the fuck is you doin? (broke niggas)
Nigga get your life together (fo real)
They told me you pickin up, the fuck you supposed to be slangin? (oh)
Told ya I never heard of you niggas so keep bangin

[Chorus]

[L.E.O.]
Yeah you lyin fam, I read niggas like diagrams
Honest man, I see through you niggas like sonograms
Pay homage or pray homage or take days to find em
When I put his days behind him
Don't take brain to define him, nor a thang to harm him
With a lil ??? to charm him and a lil pain to calm him
Fuckin with my dealer while ya'll niggas on different shit
How you beffin with a nigga thats killin shit and squeelin shit
Niggas pussy like lips and clitoris
Pussy whole, my flow sick like syphillis
Rediculous, niggas ain't funny, they ticklish
Like a wet throat, gulping that licorice
Real niggas fight turtles with two bangers
Thats your word, never heard of you, keep bangin
I'm danger like little kids with strangers
My anger had me strangle a nigga with a hanger

[Chorus]

[Outro: L.E.O]
???, you niggas know what's goin down, Stack what up?
You have a bunch of niggas in the hood
'He's talkin bout this one, no no, he's talkin bout this one'
But dig this, if you listen, and you get offended
Then we got your attention, ya dig?[Hook x2: Lauryn Hill]
Oh-oh-oh I'm coolin' with my niggas on the Wake up Show-oh-oh
We kick a little something for the radio-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Nas]
Check it, bust it
Tune it up it's the corrupt novelist, Nas
Involved in this liveness radio waves
Slaves thrive inside of this
Wake Up Show flow, hip-hop's alarm clock, the bomb spot
Mellow with ganja, that makes my eyes turn yellow
Seat reclined on my leather sofa
However close to Na- be I'm Joe Quicks
King Tech I could just see 'em on the one and two son
My blunted crew pour the rum
92.3, number one in the slum
Representin' DJ's
Sway's the host, see police the most
What a collaboration see I'm comatose
No pork just knowledge and I'm born once more
It's the beat that blesses the street deep in the 9-4

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Hip-hops last prophet henceforth in excistence
The 92.3 megahertz will exert radio waves
The slaves for a phenomenal distance
Electrons appear to slice through jeeps that you can hear some
Slum that it will chunk consider it will numb your eardrum
Kid, you sleepin' like a Latter Day Saint
With Sway & King Tech gon' wake you up on a saturday
9 to 12 verbal junkies overdose
And Joe Quicks will get you fixed to the mix
And then I'm ghost win

[Verse 3: Prince Poetry]
In your sleep I slap you with a lethal doses of medicine
So Wake Up with Organizin' the bretherin
King Tech, Joe Quiks better than your last fix
Severing wackness with Sway the host dumps a fat mix
Baby doll is frontin' so saturday night's open
Hoppin' on the one on one, times scope
And 92.3 degree is chokin' on chocolate
And from thou smokin' Prince Po'
Blows up from LA to Lobokin and I'm out

[Verse 4: Ras Kass]
Yo it's the Wake Up Show
My genetic make up take up
One hundred and thirty pounds of beef
But my lyrics shake up, like January 17th
Cause all the 16th MC's fossils
Protect ya neck and wear a bulletproof vest on ya tonsils
Amateurs bandage ya cornea
Cause you don't wanna see California
Get C-arson and spittin arsenic
With Sway Tech and Joe Quicks on the mix
Spinal meningitis ain't as stiff as the riff
Of Ras Kass, styles last like Jason crackers with whips
Come equipped you're losin' your paraphernalia
I'm a hip hop apostle
Sing in the gospel like Mehailja, Jackson
It's saturday nine until the break of dawn
Put cocaine on my tongue
You got crack now rock on *echo*

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Dred Scott]
Saturday night get live set it off
Right swing with my peeps
King Tech yo pass the mic and turn her up
Yeahyeahyeah it's peen kablow Dred Scott it's
Nine o clock, time for the Wake Up Show
To the breaker you think I'mma say dawn
But I say, day, cause it rhymes with Sway
My word is bond I'm on the scene
Plottin out the mainstream doin
Them right, with Joe Quicks on the mix
Late in the night so tune in
Cause the crew don't sleep
Boomin in ya Jeep on 92.3

[Verse 6: Shyheim]
It's 9 o'clock PM, 92.3 the Beat begins
To rock hip-hop non-stop, you know who got the props
In L.A. on saturdays, Tech and Sway no doubt

[Verse 7: ??]
Set your clocks for the unorthodox hip-hop that drops
Nine to midnight King Tech and Sway yo those kids is tight
In the mix with Joe Quicks the verbs spit verses
With the purpose of droppin curses like a triple six
Fat snares and dirty kicks to get ya open
From Watts to Oakland it's that raw {shit} that start provokin
Smokin, word's precise like a laser, cross roads in the Wake Up Show
We'll get your party shakin like a pager on silent mode, yeahha
Nine to twelve saturday night fool, peep the episode

[Verse 8: Saafir]
Wake Up, Show, and you can tell
I'm not spittin it in no muffled style
No silent screams just weddings, rings
To swings and Sway Techs King, Tech-
-nique and I'm building in a little agility from Joe Quicks
Hey Jay-Z in the eyes
It's seen only on the bottom of water risin
We're takin groups
Put it on 92.3 while your beatin boops, oops
I mean coops bumpin in to mission on the twine
Swoop saturday between nine and twelve I'm delvin
We're well tuned in to the pattern of the year
Here on 92.3 times me
Bo junks young ricks are bolders
That are only soldiers are connected to Wake Up Show
Ya right

[Hook][Poppa Wu]
I'm a manchild born in the promised land
Captain of my destiny, guidin my faith through the turbulence of life
See, in order to be who you are, you've got to know who you are
In order to get to where you want to go
You've got to know from where you came
Say, it was Malcolm X who said
"A man who doesn't have nothing to stand up for
Will fall for any god damn thing!"

[Shyheim]
Damn, Woke up again...

Down my face drop tears, it's like nobody cares
I swear, life ain't fair, sometimes I wanna disappear
Only Blahzay Blah', I got mad gray hairs, I'm a young old man
What part of "Shit Iz Real" don't you understand?
Twin got murdered, caught one to the temple
You ain't been what I been through, Can It Be All So Simple?
I got bad nerves, it's absurd, I'm disturbed
So, I suggest you watch the words that you blurb
Out your mouth, or it'll be a shoot out
I leave you stretched out, I'm thugged, inside and out
And it ain't by choice
I'm screaming out loud for love (AHHHH!), do anybody hear my voice?
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Went through the rain and pain, where's the sunshine and joy?
I can't seem to find it, trapped in the black cloud
Watching my life go down, to hide the suffering, I smile

[Hook: Tekitha]
Running these streets can be so
Trying these trying times
Manchild in the promised land
Who of you will understand?
Running these streets can be so
Trying these trying times
Manchild in the promised land, hey-ay...

[Shyheim]
My aunt died from AIDS, I watched her deteriorate
She told me fucking wit drugs, was her biggest mistake
Put my moms on to it, sticking needles in her veins
Being sons of addicts, yo, me and Cane the same
We packed bags at Pathmark, we both humped Tamika
We used to go to the pool, just to steal kid's sneakers
Rocked cut-off beepers, wore old clothes for Easter
Shit was so real, we had to split a slice of pizza
I was born at six months, damn, premature
My moms birthed a thug like, Afeni Shakur
I'm surprised I ain't crazy, from the bug shit I saw
I caught my mother buying crack on the first floor, before
I never thought I'd be in a cell, smoking the Newport
With all sorts of thoughts, running through my mind
Know I ain't leaving, caught, D.A. talkin jail time
I glanced at my mom's eyes, she looking like she wanna cry

[Hook 2x]

[Shyheim]
They say I'm an accident waiting to happen, G
Miss Ann from the first floor said she gon' pray for me
She had a bad dream, that they, murdered me
I said, "Miss, truthfully, I don't believe in dreams"
Hope is miles away, from where I stay
Who knows the way? Pssshhh... shit, I'd pay
For the directions? My whole family's in correction
Fake friends half-stepping, I'm stressing, answer question
Can I trust you? Uh-huh, then I love you
Yea, if not, straight up and down, fuck you
Bottom line, real people do real things
Play your position... (running these streets can be so...)

[Hook to fade]

[Poppa Wu in background of Hook]
You see, its like this
You've got to plan your work and work your plan
Cause seeing who fails the plan, plans the fail
Execute your strategy and seize your goal
Cause see, persistence overcomes resistance
Peace[Intro: Shyheim]
"And then.. and then.. and then.."
I miss y'all
"And then.. and then.. and then.."
I really loved y'all
Always will, never forget y'all
"And then you're gone.. After All These Years"

[Shyheim]
I woke up in the coffin, and started coughin'
I pushed the pine box top right the fuck open
Dirt surroundin' me, I dug 'til my nails was bleedin'
Six-feet up, I bust out the ground, now I'm breathin' (AHdH!)
Standin' on two feet in the middle of the cemetary
Where all my family and homeboys is buried
I hopped the gate but first I paid my respects
Ran up to a car mirror, bugged out when I reflect
No holes in my head, no holes in my chest
Is this "Life After Death"?
I thought for a sec', and I wondered
Checked my pocket I found a blunt
And a piece of paper with 2Pac and Biggie's number
I called 'em and Big L picked up the phone
He said 'Freaky Tah here' I said 'Put my nigga on'
We called Pun on 3 way, Mausberg was with Eazy
I told 'em niggas, 'Yo y'all live through me'
'And I'mma keep hip hop and bop in your memory'
One love y'all, rest in peace Aaliyah

[Hook: samples]
"And then you're gone.. After All These Years"
"And then.. and then.. and then you're gone.. After All These Years"
"And then.. and then.. and then you're gone.. After All These Years
"I still need your love"
"And then.."

[Shyheim]
I smoked a blunt and bumped my album
It started to dwell, the rap game won't be the same without you L
I'mma mourn you and stay thuggin' 'til I join you
Wanted to snatch you out the casket when I saw you
Resting in peace-fully, just lying there in your blue Gucci wear
Rockin' ya Cardiers, I'm like 'Damn why they hit my man?'
Ready to air somethin' out like a fuckin' fan
My head I shook, signed my name in the book (uh-huh)
I ain't care who look (uh-huh), I dropped tears
Jumped in the truck, threw on Sam Cook
Every time I bounce a ball I'm walkin' through the park
I can't help it, I gotta think about Sandy Brock
Every time I get jig, I'mma think of Pooh
Everytime I think of Sax is when I argue
I think of Grandma a lot, I think of Grandpa a lot
I think of Twin a lot, aiyo I miss 'em a lot, for real

[Hook]

[Shyheim]
The world'll keep movin' even when my heart stop
My niggas won't let my spirit die on my block
Spray-paintin' my name on the wall with RIP on top
11/14 'til the day I drop
But I'm not leavin' without my crazy ass ways
Beautiful memories and cold rainy days
I swear, I wish that bullet was a blank
So before I thank my family and friends, I'd like to thank
My mom first of all, you my true best friend
Lord, I hope my Devil leads to her to help her pick up again
And I'd like to thank my fam, no-one compares to y'all
I'd like to thank my squad, I'd like to thank the Gods
Ton of y'all I say hello to my boo
I gotta thank 27, gotta thank the Wu
So my time is tickin' and I'm gaspin' for breath
Killah Kane "When You Come Home" you can keep the rest
Goodbye

[Hook][Shyheim]
Yo, what the deal?
Criminals, what up?
We're not born we're created
From the streets
And this goes out to all my thugs, criminals, ballers, hustlers
Big up to self, Big up to self
Get y'all weight up
No diggity, No doubt
G.P. Wu, Yo drop my shit right now

I gotta get my weight up
Fuck eight balls I'm flippin kilos
Did dirt so now I lay low from street foes
Broke niggas and bitches wanna take what I got
Tell the jakes about my spots
They mad cuz I make a lot
From Monday through Sunday I see about a million
Run with thugs that's down for killin, civilians
I'm thug related, pack nuff heat, they call me fire
Niggas fear my verbal technique cuz I'm Kaiser
So say I represent the ghetto worldwide
Bust techs, puff lye
From A to Z's Doe or Die
Fuck around and get lifted off this Earth
Take my word for what it's worth
I put that on the turf

Chorus: [Shyheim] (Squig) {2X}

I'm all out on my own, I'm goin out son
I'm all out on my own, I'm goin out (dun)
I'm all out on my own, I'm goin out
(Like Patty LaBelle said I'm out on my own)

[Shyheim]
I'm all out on my own like Al Capone
Cuz niggas want my dome, so I pack a 4 lb. chrome
Stash it near my nuts in the front
But keep it in arm distance cuz I'm gonna have to bust
The first victim that comes too close to me and shit
My clips packed up thick legit and victed
To go to war at any given time
I gotta protect me and mine
Before the damn flat line
I'm still young but I'm growin up mad fast
Treated like trash and dumped out on my ass
No one understands me but me
Nobody cares about how I feel but me
So what I gotta do is do for me
I wonder how that be goin all out for me
I got mad problems but I try to deal wit em
I wish that I could fight em
And shoot the fear one wit em
But the devil keeps on hawkin me
My soul he wantin G
But that shit I can't see

Chorus {2X}

[Shyheim]
I had many dreams of being a star in the NBA
But they got thrown away when I saw them slingin yay
I put the ball down, picked the ounce up, then I read up
Now I'm 200 G's up and on my uptown
To meet up with these big druglords from Cuba
I don't trust em like a chickenhead so I'm bring the luger
And my 19-9-6 shot beamer
Flying on the West Side highway, that's when I seen her
Van full of jiggy
Oh now they wanna get me
At full pushin 80 max while I'm hittin the buck 50
Niggas know Dig me blazin the la-la
The weed keep me zoned word to Taiwana
K-basa baby, you know who loves you girl
Young wild thugs we rule the world

Chorus {2X}

[Shyheim] (Squig)
Yea, Uh, I'd like to give a mad big up
(No doubt, represent)
Respect to the 2 Cent click
B-I, my man Ty motha fuckin D
(What up Ski?)
One time, Squig, word up, Vin-cent
Redman, Rubba-Rubba-Rubbabandz
Hah hah, and it, and it don't stop[Verse 1: Scoob]
This here for the motherfuckin record
Here we here we here we go, here we here we go
Can I can I can I kick a motherfuckin flow
Chitty chitty bang bang, I chitty bang bang
Motherfuckin niggas can't hang
Well oh no, look at the cloud, it's gonna rain
But I don't give a fuck I'm letting niggas know they can't hang
Don't give me no lip, don't give me no backtalk, yeah break North
Don't make me get my gun and blow your motherfuckin head off
Once again, niggas know my style, God damn it
Unless it's on the cut so give me the mic and watch me slam it
Hard like Shaquille, oh you better kneel
When you see me comin, Big Scoob got em runnin
Sex when I flex I catch wreck on the world tour
With dough in my pockets big like the Biscuits, in CB4
Set up a contest, I'm coming, I'm taking the dough
They wouldn't pick you even if you had a afro
So don't try me, you better walk by me
I'll do you like the first part in Menace II Society
Like Cypress Hill, yo, I'm insane
I'll shoot a hole in your toe
I'll make you jump like the House of Pain
Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang
Niggas can't hang, niggas can't hang
Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang, motherfuckin niggas can't hang

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
We gonna do it like this
Anytime you're ready, check it:
I got seven Mack-11's, about eight 38's
Nine 9's, ten MAC-10's, the shit never ends
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lambsbread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns,I make number runs
I give mc's the runs, drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK,I slay from far away
Everybody hit the d-e-c-k
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Mateo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my god, I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin', smackin' babies at their Christenin'

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Yeah, where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw up your motherfuckin middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this
I thank the lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us from a MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
A straight soldier, buckin at the bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug life, motherfucker crime pays
Let the cops put their lights on: chase me nigga!
Zig zaggin' through the freeway: race me nigga!
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw

[Verse 4: Shyheim]
Yo, this goes out to everybody from Staten Island
{*ah Mister Cee, and you don't stop*}
Yo, times is getting hard, word is bond, I swear to God
I even got caught trying to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a rebel without a pause
I never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parking lot
In front of my building I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigger then tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

[Kane] This how we gonna do it, hold up Cee, aiyyo, let's try this
[Shy] Staten Island in the motherfuckin house!
Wassup, Wu-Tang Clan in here or what?

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Now what's the bullshit niggas been saying
Dont try to act like Martin now with that "I was just playin!"
No need to grieve now on, now that the beef is on
Uhh!! Oh yeah motherfucker, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap don't meant that you're catching wreck with me
Step to this I'll give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one nigga that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle, I gots to have it, 'lest you're gonna rob me
Like they did, Whittaker when he fought Chavez
Cause when it comes to going against Kane rappin
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nothing happenin
Non-resistible, non compatible
I'm not saying I'm the best, I'm just saying I'm fuckin incredible
And let's just get one more thing understood
If I fart on a record, trust me nigga, that shit gon' sound good[Intro: Shyheim, sample]
"Is that any way for a man to carry on, carry on
Carry on" - sample repeated throughout intro
Mister education, I'm on my way, let's go, uh huh
Ask yourself, if you was me, yeah, carry on, but you
Ain't got now

[Shyheim]
Layin' in my cell, starin' at the ceiling, oh what a fucked up feeling
The things that I used to adore, I no longer find appealing
And the girl I loved so much, she started exhaling
While I was jailing, my niggas turned the other cheek
So I stopped calling, I sensed they ain't wanna speak
I couldn't go to sleep, no one to hug but my sheets
Kept bangers for the beef, that follow me from the street
Dear mama, I wrote you a letter, why you ain't write back?
Must of went right back, to the pipe and crack
If it wasn't for grandma, I would of been hung up
But I heard her voice in my head, tellin' me to be tough
I put the sheet back on the mattress, where the fuck is my matches
When I need a cigarette, you ain't feelin' my pain yet
So, anybody, everybody, somebody, please
Tell me, is this any way?

[Hook 2X: sample]
"Is that any way for a man to carry on, carry on carry on
Oh oh... yeah..., carry on"

[Shyheim]
Last night I couldn't sleep, I tossed and turned
Heard hell was hot and dark, and the fire really burns
My lawyer firm, couldn't get this day to germ
So I'm sittin' on the edge of the bed, I lit a C, I journed
Took a deep inhale, blew out the smoke, like fuck it kid
It is what it is, I'mma die in jail
And for my last million, you know the God, from the mob ate spaghetti
Soon as I birthed, the C.O. jerked "Franklin, you ready?"
I guess so, he like 'let's go', my comrade next go
Scream "hold your head, babe bro", Yeah yeah
See you when you get there, I'mma have it crackin'
For every G mackin', in this sad fashion, we started laughing
The funny thing was, it wasn't nothin' funny
At the end nothing matters, the God,drugs or the money
I'm shackled bashful, walking down the corridor
Chains draggin' on the floor, I said a prayer for all of y'all

[Hook 2X]

[Shyheim]
Seven four pound, I'm wakin' up to a count
Washed my face, brushed my teeth, rinsed my mouth
My super three, blastin' ODB off the meter
And I sip a cup of Folgers, fresh off the stinger
Got my greens on, sittin' with my feet up
Waitin' on the porter, to bring my feed up
Cuz yesterday, in the fish tank, a bitch nigga got ate
And beat up, I'm blowin', stick after stick
But stayin' on my water game, avoiding the dirty dick
I ain't rich, I don't spit on no home for nigga's chicks
Stay in my gangsta pose, like every move I make false, click click
You can catch Shy in transit, with my eyes open
Scopin' out for my bandits, it better be more careful
Like the book written by Shannon, I never signed in
Got disciplinary record, that Flex can't even split
I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya
My rep rap in the kept, like seven up, not the soda
I stopped at Wendy's, but it wasn't for a burger
I'm a Clinton hub thug, and the green bloods get no love
And in Marcy, I really see niggas cough up a lung
But I'm really tryin' to chill, get closer to home
And God forget, the fish kill, yea, I'm that real dealIntro:
You want lessons?
It's to get with it, we out nigga
Come on!

[Shyheim]
I came into the party with my fly Wu-Wear shit on
Two hundred in, my teeth flex, gotta throw my hit on
Movin through the crowd with my shines hangin out
Hit the bar, for a Henney straight, no chaser
Guzzle it down, honies crowdin around the Killa Bee
Buy you a drink, you kidding? Love, you got to be
Since you on my dick, won't you buy me a drink?
Chewin my ear off, tellin me that she met me in the rink
I don't get tricky, got too much G
Got a degree in P.I.M.P-alogy, acknowledge me
Not a playa, teach these niggas how to be, I'm ?Wallabeeneny?
Thugs throw it up, everytime they see me
I hollow back, "Where the bats at?"
Baseball fitted hat, 7-1-8ths, New York Yanks'
She was Miss Elliot Trace, from her shoes to her face
With a body just like a Ferrari shape
She asks me, "How you get that cut on your face"?
That's when the DJ shouted out, "Shyheim's in the place"
I was high off the notion and case
It must have been her birthday cuz she was holdin mad cake
Her man holdin no weight
He low-budget, she told me we was fluckin
We with two of her friends and three of her cousins
We in the corner whinin, my whole team's shinin
It's time to go when these fake rappers start rhymin
For real son

Chorus:
You know the club scene, 7-40, I beam
You know the club scene, big icy links and minks
You know the club scene, fuck around and get shot
You know the club scene, niggas spend all they got
You know the club scene, shorty, she lookin hot
You know the club scene, niggas be on Bra'
You know the club scene, you better tuck your watch
You know the club scene, we flossin in the parkin lot

[Shyheim]
There's a party goin on, down the blizz-ock
In this little hot box, but you might get shot
Cuz there's a lot of Knuckleheadz, who'll be playin this club
A hole in the wall, I got my gun in, ain't searchin at all
I watch you hand-to-hand niggas, that be tryin to ball
With your little ghetto-fame, Tech to snatch your chain
They used to call him Killa, now Got-Murdered his name
I smack Earth, Wind & Fire out lames
Take money, thuggin ain't a thing
I got my drink in my right hand, left hand in my pants
I don't dance, just be loungin in my B-boy stance
Respect my gangsta, move like an army at war
Spit some Willy in the air, and we slid out the door
About a quarter to 4:00, jumped in the 4x4, smooth like velour
Say no more, every party I go to, I bring a bird home
Call me Cabosa Indiana Jones

Chorus

[Shyheim]
I had this show O.T., at this venue called Ritz
I was rockin the mic, when I noticed this bitch
She was lickin her lips and her rubbin her tits
I can tell that she stripped, I had to politic
But she was with this achin bitch, Alienation bitch
Throwin peanuts in my Jif, makin me sick
Etcera, etcera, I'm liable to get rid of her
I don't give a fuck
Took her in the bathroom, picked her up in the tub
I'm like a drug, I be stalkin the club
Ladies beware, eighteen and above, what?
I'm a heart-breaker, the mind-raper
That don't spend no paper and don't like bitches that wear makeup['Gangs of New York' sample]
By the ancient laws of combat
I accept the challenge of the so called, natives
You plague our people at every torrent
But from this day out, you shall plague us no more
For let it be known, that the hand that tries to strike us from this land
Shall be swiftly cut down

[Shyheim]
The Dust Juice, medical term, embalming fluid
In my neighborhood, Stapleton, we grew up doing it
If you take one pull of it, slow motion, slow motion, you will be moving in it
You'll be so wet, your mind opens space
I know alotta niggas, who love the spearmint taste
I knew you was blowing, cuz you had the stuck face
Get him some milk, I heard somebody say
That the Dust Juice, be having niggas going crazy
Knew a dude named Woosh, jumped in the ocean with his baby
The Dust Juice, I can get you a bundle for eighty
Even the white girls smoke it, I got bopped with Katie
The Dust Juice, has many different names
The Dust Juice, is also called Purple Rain
The Dust Juice, the Red Devil, Crazy Eddie
Stick to your B-Boy, you really not ready
For the Dust Juice, gotta keep it in the freezer
So dusted, can't feel your toes or your fingers
Floating on air, floating on air
Einstein smoked and came up with ideas
If you could fly, why walk up the stairs?
The Dust Juice, made him think he Superman

[Hook 4X: Shyheim]
The Dust Juice
The Dust Juice (who got the juice now, man?)

[Castro]
They call me diamond fluid, the type of shit that makes your head evil
The type of drug they inject inside dead people
Dark water, call me ism, some call me dust
Put me in a cigarette, you'll get a quicker rush
Head spinning, you'll feel invincible and hella strong
If you O.D., your mind can be forever gone
Can't sleep, paranoid for your bones
What a scary tale, I'm talking dust, not a fairy's trail
Dark liquid, type of shit that preserve bodies
Shit stink, murder ink, I'm not Irv Gotti
Take a pull, I've been out since Paid in Full
Raging Bull, that's how you feel when you smoke a sticky
Don't exist, you see the demons where the ghostses live
Read juice, you can't hang, don't smoke the shit
You can't hang, don't smoke the shit
You can't hang, don't smoke the shit

[Hook 4X]*Report set to "Co-Defendant" beat*

"And you will know my name is the lord..." -] Samuel L. Jackson

[Big L]
Shyheim, yeah
Corleone
Uh-huh, check it out

Y'all niggas be walkin the streets, iced out
Not knowin the walk, so put the price out
To get you stuck and punch ya lights out
Or catch ya car in the night and snatch ya wife out
And beat the ho up if you don't give the dough up
You got me pissed off, frontin and ya whole clique soft
If ya had ya Roly on, I might cut ya wrist off
Then lick off, and slide ya bitch off, punk
I hope ya ready for the kick-off
Ya flankin niggas and I'm gettin rich off
I done sold coke, sold crack, sold smoke, sold smack
Now I wanna go plat', can I get a soul clap
It ain't no part a time out, once I climb out
The garbage can, wit 2 nines out, and blow ya spine out
Oh I got you cats by a long-shot, every song hot
1-3-9 and Lennox is a strong block
I left enough a y'all stinkin
What the fuck was y'all thinkin?
My shit's tight, nigga, I spit writin
Yo, what?

[Shyheim]
Young outlaw, the state wanna get rid a me
I'll probably die from the death penalty
Y'all analog, Shyheim I keep it digity
I'm not pussy so I don't need security
Like Big L, I'm MVP on the street
I did wet more people than the pool and the beach
So be easy, or I'll expose you like shock TV
O.G., that's why they put me in a movie
Don't screw me, cuz if I punch you in ya face
You'll probably try and sue me, and take me to Judge Judy
Look me in my eyes cuz ya handshake don't fool thee
Stapleton Staten Islander, the name's marked on the calender
Ain't no screwin off a silencer, uh-uh

"And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
And furious anger on those who attempt to poison and destroy
My brothers, and you will know my name is the lord." -] Samuel L. Jackson

[Big L]
If you got somethin to say, then cough it out
Cuz niggas be wantin beef, but when you pull out
The heat they ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about?
You was just frontin, now it ain't nuttin
Ain't that somethin? I should start bustin anyway
And put one a you punks in the ground
Y'all niggas be killin me with y'all faces round, jumpin around
Like you scarin us, not even
Cuz me and Shy' gon' be some thugs til we stop breathin

"My name is the lord..." -] Samuel L. Jackson

[Shyheim]
Niggas be actin like they hoodlums
Until they get shot up or locked up, now they Bloods and Muslims
In the Wu, benz bang em like a Benz, touch kid nuttin thin
Put his ear to his chin
I gotta win and beat this game of dyin rich and old
Cuz these playa-hatin niggas wanna block my gold
It's untold like the truth, they thirsty for my juice
But when I let loose, have them jumpin out they boots[Intro: Shyheim]
Yeah, Shyheim, nigga a/k/a S.I
A/k/a Jonathan Jackson the Manchild, you hear me
Got my nigga, Lex, yeah, Jersey, Staten Island
Bottom Up, Brock Bros., Stapleton, what up

[Shyheim]
I got S.I. on my back and I'm swimmin', 9000 miles back home
My whole hood, happy, I'm back home
I'm the backbone, black stone, Greatest Story Never Told
Came to the wilderness of North America, alone
Stompin' like a giant, on my corner, mash potato Timb's
Containin' more fucked iodine, vitamins
I'm grindin', puttin' it in, from the Bottom Up
And I don't rock watches or bracelets, cuz they remind me of handcuffs
Niggas woke up a sleeping dragon, you hear that fire coming out my mouth
You better call the red and white wagons
And while you at it, tell 'em don't forget that leak water
I be so wet whoadee, I can dry water, and for all y'all
Niggas out there, thinkin' y'all tough
Real gangstas, like myself'll make y'all buckle like the end of a belt
My handle's critically acclaimed, locked down the game
With a one and two side, amex in the main

[Hook 2X: Shyheim (Lex)]
I'm back (Yeah, Shy, see you hear, never left
But you back in the hood, so tell me what's really good)
It's great (See, niggas thought it wouldn't happen
Picture the kid rapping, yes, niggas he's back in)

[Lex]
Cuz it's back, this young dude from the Bricks, homey
Became immune to the strip, carry two's, put shoes on the whip
And I move with the fifth, on me, in case dudes wanna flip
I leave 'em leakin', droolin' in shit
But I can't stop, my block needs me, but just remember
That bustin' these shots, and duckin' these cops, is not easy
I'm down for whatever, I stand on the pavement, I'm trynna
Round up this cheddar, I need a vacation
I'm so stressed and my girl don't help, she can't understand
Why I'm so stressed and why I worry myself
And it's really starting to bother a nigga
So with this weight laws, I'm startin' to shake off, pardon a nigga
Balls, I got paper, but I'm far from a million
That's why I'm, still in these streets, I hustle hard in these buildings
Yeah, they say it's wrong, that these crackheads need me
But I can't, leave it alone, cuz crackheads feed me
Ricky, Shawn, Daneen and Barbara, Phylis and Ursula
Got so much, that I'm needing a worker
Show 'em how to move, and gets moved with a slot game
But only talk samples, when the color of your top change

[Hook 2X]

[Shyheim]
I got a call from Bobby Digital, he said it's critical
For me to record a new album, I said aight, no interviews
I refuse to talk to any reporters or disc jockeys
This is for the people, so I got a right to be coky
I'm the one and only, the only one chosen
I preserve my microphone in, by keeping it frozen
As a child, I said realer shit than most of you grown men
I'm certified, ultra live, the ghetto says so
Play my tape, even the roaches gon' come chill in your radio
I'm ruthless, but won't day real easy, got whole hoods
Wearin' mechanic suits, I do dudes so greasy
I'm a hoodlum, til they turn out my lights, and give me a quarter
I still have more girlfriends, than Diana Ross daughter
It's a manslaughter....

[Hook 2X][4 x Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough]

Thug niggas bounce to this
Only thug niggas bounce to this
Word up
I wan't no fruitcake ass ? niggas bouncing to this shit right here
Word up, strictly hardcore only, check it

[Shyheim]
Gunshots, they travel throughout my projects quickly
I stay thuggin', for pray the god that none hits me
Me and my peoples we swarm in packs
Some rap others sell crack, to get stacks of the green paper
We move makers, lex and landcruisers takers
Block vacators, thugs that run 5 acres of land
Flooded with dealers who kill for grams
It's the street life, baby you wouldn't understand nothing
Getting my hustle on, just 8 to 10
But here I go again, cause recreation programs
They makin' me no grands
So much stress on my mind I can just kill a man

[2 x Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough]

[Shyheim]
I never knew my own dad when I was young he broke out
That's when my mom got smoked out
And I took the street route, I hung around with real gangstas
Playas and hustlas, I guess they liked my style a lot
So they took a little nigga under the wing
Eventually I started slingin' white shit
No time for school cause the hours didn't mix
So sleep late at night most nights I didn't even sleep
That's how I got caught up, and sold a dime to the beast
They offered me a 1 to 3, hahaa , I do a bullet
Traded in my gats for greens that's how the state do it
I'm movin' ain't no joking get your muthafuckin' dosage
So when you and the penal  don't be acting like no biaaatch

[4 x Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough]

[Shyheim]
I'm seventeen now, and I'm off to parole
I see the ? a month, hopefully I be home
I'm kinda anxious, I haven't seen my friends in a year
My moms OD and when I think about it every seals
But I'm a young man that gotta change his lifestyle
Get a job at compound, it ain't easy as it sounds
I gotta have some fast money, flippin' burgers everyday
I been to ? house, I get a slinky day
Anybody in my way I'm blasting, fuck the peace
Cause there's a war upon the streets
No south west or east, all my niggas in the struggle
Hold your head and get the CREAM
Big gunz money and pussy be the US ghetto dream

[Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough ...][Poppa Wu]
I'm a manchild born in the promised land
Captain of my destiny, guidin my faith through the turbulence of life
See, in order to be who you are, you've got to know who you are
In order to get to where you want to go
You've got to know from where you came
Say, it was Malcolm X who said
"A man who doesn't have nothing to stand up for
Will fall for any god damn thing!"

[Shyheim]
Damn, Woke up again...

Down my face drop tears, it's like nobody cares
I swear, life ain't fair, sometimes I wanna disappear
Only Blahzay Blah', I got mad gray hairs, I'm a young old man
What part of "Shit Iz Real" don't you understand?
Twin got murdered, caught one to the temple
You ain't been what I been through, Can It Be All So Simple?
I got bad nerves, it's absurd, I'm disturbed
So, I suggest you watch the words that you blurb
Out your mouth, or it'll be a shoot out
I leave you stretched out, I'm thugged, inside and out
And it ain't by choice
I'm screaming out loud for love (AHHHH!), do anybody hear my voice?
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Went through the rain and pain, where's the sunshine and joy?
I can't seem to find it, trapped in the black cloud
Watching my life go down, to hide the suffering, I smile

[Hook: Tekitha]
Running these streets can be so
Trying these trying times
Manchild in the promised land
Who of you will understand?
Running these streets can be so
Trying these trying times
Manchild in the promised land, hey-ay...

[Shyheim]
My aunt died from AIDS, I watched her deteriorate
She told me fucking wit drugs, was her biggest mistake
Put my moms on to it, sticking needles in her veins
Being sons of addicts, yo, me and Cane the same
We packed bags at Pathmark, we both humped Tamika
We used to go to the pool, just to steal kid's sneakers
Rocked cut-off beepers, wore old clothes for Easter
Shit was so real, we had to split a slice of pizza
I was born at six months, damn, premature
My moms birthed a thug like, Afeni Shakur
I'm surprised I ain't crazy, from the bug shit I saw
I caught my mother buying crack on the first floor, before
I never thought I'd be in a cell, smoking the Newport
With all sorts of thoughts, running through my mind
Know I ain't leaving, caught, D.A. talkin jail time
I glanced at my mom's eyes, she looking like she wanna cry

[Hook 2x]

[Shyheim]
They say I'm an accident waiting to happen, G
Miss Ann from the first floor said she gon' pray for me
She had a bad dream, that they, murdered me
I said, "Miss, truthfully, I don't believe in dreams"
Hope is miles away, from where I stay
Who knows the way? Pssshhh... shit, I'd pay
For the directions? My whole family's in correction
Fake friends half-stepping, I'm stressing, answer question
Can I trust you? Uh-huh, then I love you
Yea, if not, straight up and down, fuck you
Bottom line, real people do real things
Play your position... (running these streets can be so...)

[Hook to fade]

[Poppa Wu in background of Hook]
You see, its like this
You've got to plan your work and work your plan
Cause seeing who fails the plan, plans the fail
Execute your strategy and seize your goal
Cause see, persistence overcomes resistance
Peace[sample]
That's a big bad motherfucka comin your way

[Intro: Shyheim (Pop Da Brown Hornet)]
One two one two one two one two
(Hey yo Shyheim wassup baby
There be a lot of shorties out here rockin the mic
For like one or two singles but they don't keep comin at em baby
You got to come non-stop like consecutive blows to the head dome
Gotta keep em movin non-stop, gotta keep em movin, that's all I got to tell
You
Just keep em movin)

[Shyheim]
Hey yo what's goin on
Nowadays brothers keep testin me
Tryin to get me open and take out the best of me
They pull up rough, get snuffed, and then bust
When I kick that old underground funk stuff
That's comin atcha, better run from the rapture
Before I gat'cha I'm buckin shots atcha
Buck-buck-buck means you punks better duck
Kid you're outta luck, try to flip you get stuck
By the Wu-Tang sword, oh lord you shoulda bucked south
I'm spittin out on brothers straight from my mouth
You just been ripped now watch your blood drip
Right down your lip and then I'm ghost in my whip
Take a sip I'm the candyman, I got sweets
For all the sweet MCs that fake funk in the streets

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Gots to keep em movin baby)
Gotta move it over here
(Non-stop, non-stop like this)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo I said I wasn't gonna say no more but I got a little bit more to say)
Gotta move it over here
(Shyheim you gotta keep em movin baby gotta keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(They can't fuck with you)

[Shyheim]
Up comes a shorty, sneaky one
Armed with the loaded gun, shit's on lock til I'm done
Bad little bastard I'm a rugged child classic
How could you ask it when you know that I rips it
Check how the Shy flips his tongue like a pro
Fifteen years old with nuff skills to flow
Props, damn right kid, you know I got lots
If rockin hip-hop was a crime call the cops
Become a wanted man who was forced to be a fugitive
A shorty outta Shaolin Isle with somethin new to give
You wanna hear it? It goes a little somethin like this
The Wu-Tang click is comin thick
If I must be the setter then I'ma have to set it
Forget it, that's your last buck don't even bet it
If it's rough then it's right and I'm never goin left
I'm not a comedy but my jams pack mad def
My napsack's full with mad goodies
My click keeps a low profile with black hoodies
You wanna see me flop, well how can you figure
Cause bein rough and rugged's doin well for a nigga

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo move em over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo I don't care where you move em just keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(That's all I want you to do baby, hah)

[Shyheim]
Back in the flesh it's the wanna get buckwild
From Staten Isle it's the return of the rugged child
I'm no pimp but I walk with a slick limp
And I catch a dunk off the funk like Shawn Kemp
I be the beat of the rugged rhyme freaker
To blow out your speaker, got more soul than sneakers
I swing the parties with the tunes that I hit, many bit
But then I zipped up that lip quick
I keep it smashed when they dash for my cash they get blast
And slapped on that ass real fast
I'm supposed to be the best when they flex
Don't get vexed, just put that mess right to rest
I'm an enemy cause my style is not public
Don't dub it cause my flow is masteredly rugged

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo when I hear this jam right here I know Shy is tellin me keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(That means if I gotta pull a biscuit out your head and tell you)
Gotta move it over here
(To get off the wall that's what I'ma tell ya)
Gotta move it over here
(Cause he's comin hardcore for ya, unh unh)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo like over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo, yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo keep em movin yo, yo keep em movin[Verse 1 ]
Nowadays you gots’ ta walk the street and watch your back
Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowin’ how to act
They always pull the Glock when somebody rocks a knot
And if they get shot they often snitch to the cops
Now tell me this ain’t livin foul
She just had a baby child and she’s back to sellin’ cracks vials
On the Ave cause she’s addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass
But honey-dip dont wanna listen cause she’s in no position
Now nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then comittin’ suicide

[Hook 2x]
June Luva:
Hey Yo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing
From hookerin' to drug slang (repeat 2)

Verse Two (Shyheim):
Times is gettin' hard, word is bond I swear God
I even got caught tryin' to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, A rebel without a cause
Ain't nevah had a good Christmas so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil’ town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin' lot
In front of my buildin' I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

Hook

Hey Yo, get a load of this guy you know the Mr. Hard-y
He the one who talk about gats but ain't' bustin nobody
He speaks the name game so he can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame but his mom said he gang bang
But his rep was hi-tech in the projects
Pulled his knuckle-jacks so he got mad respect
The niggas in hoodies packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and at nine was dopin’ and coked
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few brothers, drug dealers, most of them fugitives

Hook x5[Shyheim]
The precinct is crooked, my man got grabbed up
Had cracks on him worth about a bullet
They just took it, asked him a few questions like, "Where's the guns?"
They tried to g him to tell them where was Un
How they come?
Ten deep in a red fifteen passenger
Guns out when they jumped out, pointed at us
Here comes, what they call a procedure
Slamming us against a gate, cuffing us before they beat us

[Channel Live]
It's like they can't trust us, they wanna bust us
And crush us, they sayin f' us, there's no peace, no just-us
They claim to protect us, they serve and they wreck us
Never respect us, arrest us and always stress us

To see the Devil die is my purpose of to live up
Self-determinance is the must, I practice kujichagulia
Yo, free your mind and yo *bitch* is sure to follow
And free will come to lock it down, look out for tips thats hollow

[Wise Intelligent (of Poor Righteous Teachers)]
It's P.I.T. soprano
Mix it down, dedicated to Steve Feliciano
Directed at that steam and gouge Danno
F' the five-oh pronto, cause I know
Firsthand, Detective White and burst lead
Never did but might have to do it
Lies twenty-five, hollow shots in a pro-active unit
Exit 7A, NJ, stop the BS movement, that's how we do it
Mobilize the people, conscious *niggas* get to it

[Hook: Mos Def (of Black Star)]
My people unite and let's all get down
We got to have one love, peace and understanding
One God, one love, one life
One aim, one voice, one fight

[Hook 2: Mos Def]
My people unite, hop up and do a right
We got to have one love, peace and understanding
One God, one love, one life
One aim, one voice, one fight
My people unite, hop up and do a right (echoes)
Keep it tight y'all, do it right y'all

[Cappadonna]
Yo, forget police brutality, I work for a salary
And did time for a crime I didn't commit
They tried to beat me in my head, make a brother submit
Hit me in the face with sticks, locking me down for being around
I still remember, never surrendering to the beast
The man, peace for Diallo
My reality is to fight back police brutality

[Crunch Lo (of Othorized F.A.M.)]
Mr. officer got me trapped in a dark corridor
Long hallway, they in love with the gunplay
Swing night sticks, run thicker than Bloods and Crips
Harass mad cats and it don't make sense
Roll around in dark tints, feen to match finger prints
Search me down everyday and you still ain't content

[Rock (of Heltah Skeltah)]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Calm your nerves down, bop your heads too high
Let 'em know Rock, stop wondering why you keep getting knocked
Cause you a part time dealer, probably a part time pops
Part time killer, but them dudes is full time cops
Pick a hustle stupid, you half *ass* black acts
Stack, use your head for than a hat rack, jack*ass*
Start running your life instead of running the streets
Running your mouth, oh yeah, stop running from peace

[Hook x4]Intro: Shyheim (T.M.F. #2)

Twenty-seven (Yea, yea, yea, yea)
Wu-Tang (Stapleton, Killarmy)
Shyheim (T.M.F., Trife the under structure)
Word (What's the deal, baby?)

[Shyheim]
Yo, for the one-nine-nine-nine shit's gon' change
Now it's us in the Range, God's givin us brains
Play the game, put my heart into it, you stupid?
I'm a gunner, whenever I got the rock I'll shoot it (BLAOW! BLAOW!)
The undisputed champion on the M-I-C
Been Wu-Tang before it became a production company
Stay fresh like Doug, I run with the thugs
That'll cut your throat and sell your blood
Fifty/fifty love around the border
Should be biddin five to fifteen
On the Strength for the way I manslaughter
Rock your girl's boat like the Titanic
Man, I got more numbers than the Ninex, plus the Bell Atlantic
More hoes than forty-deuce
More clothes than twenty cleptos could boost
I'm not havin it
I bring it to your label, producer and your management
Man, I'm like the Feds, I bring down your establishment
Under the Rico, I purchased my 3rd quarterly from Bob Cito
Got your block locked like the Dred, Mike Z and Chino
You know (What? What?)

[T.M.F. #1]
Look me eye-to-eye and see what you find
A crime nigga, nine spitter, mind digga, refined
Power impact, crackin your spine, mankind
Blow off the surface like landmines in my pasttime
I saw it all, had plenty broads
Cut your wig short like Demi Moore
Ghost, vanished, most mothafuckas don't know I'm half spanish
Hazardous lyrical tactics, pinned to the matress like canvas
Get your ass kicked for talkin backwards
Puffin Backwoods, walkin thru the back of the hood
No protection, Stapleton section
Corrupt life, T.M.F. arch style, we rush mic's
Disarmed for that gold-piece charm
Red alert, we all alarmed, ready for combat
No contact, countin backwards ten-to-one
Now let me launch that, no way you can catch my format
I'm like the Gingerbread Man, movin on land
Catch me if you can, I move faster than the average man

Chorus: Shyheim {2X}

You only got one life to live
So all of my children, it's better to give than receive
Life is short, Days of Our Lives seem to speed
Still waitin for the day when Clinton legalize weed

[Dom PaChino a.k.a. P.R. Terrorist]
It's like gunplay when my darts spray
Leave you scarred today, mental washed away
I shoot like Hardaway, your body parts decay
Slow-lay, too busy lustin the Rol-ay, platinum face
I snatch you over-arms, I take you out of space
Take you into my orbit, Terrorist gone corporate
Choppin tracks into sawdust, son, so you could snort it
In the conference room, Terrorist Hymn comin soon
Album cover pitch-black like the sky, without the moon
To illuminate, in my dome-piece there lies a metal plate
Titanium, harder than a lock in your gate
Burglarize your enterprise and have fun with your mate
Cuz I'm not nasty, when doin my dirt, won't see ya masta me
Silent Weapons is a classic like Freddy Bassey
What a word pro, electro, grenade logo
Forever show how I firmly handle the phono
Bitches lust me, my plans of wettin the seeds in the mo-mo
Terrorist relatin to Shy, mi vida loco (I feel the same way)

[T.M.F. #2]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Eh yo, treasury, stackin this paper for Longevity
The money first, put it in work, that be my pedigree
Let's take it to higher degree
Sit back and visualize so our eyes could see
Black God, we livin hard
Mugs get scarred, thugs get barred
Treated like slaves in the yard
Playin the field, most niggas tell and squeal
That's why I move for 'self, only me and my steel
Cuz Shit Iz Real and leary niggas will rat you out
Get under pressure by the jakes when they smack 'em out
Gat in they mouth, for talkin, you sleep-walkin
Can't play the street often, become a victim for extortion
For your fortune, your bank rose
Stank hoes, you think I ain't cold?
Run up in your crib, take everything, even the sink goes
You sweat like a pink rose
Can you smell it, when you soft like velvet?
Catch one up in your helmet, get dealt wit
On the quick-fast, take you on a great adventure like Six Flags
Spent every day of my life just tryin to get cash
So when my shit blasts
Duck behind buildings for shelter, or you'll get hit fast
Catch whiplash, fuckin wit Trife, you must've skipped class
Your bitch-ass didn't take notes, infra-red scope beamin
I'm tired of dreamin, I wanna hit the big screen and
But keep an open eye for them cats who stay schemin

One's for the money

But we all say, HOE!

My slang and my gang bows up the concrete
Like Eric B. and Rakim
Don't sweat the technique
So you got beef
Run on sonny go get ya posse
Cause I've got a mosse, when you wear haratchies
Then you hear me kicking as I own you, it's mad ruggie
The jump on my tip, but I thought nuffin' of it
Cause I let the microphone spark right after dark
And be dropping mad skillz like my name was Pad Mark
The rebel to society
Everyone's trying me
Looking at me strange leave dim raid it'll amaze me
Had I did something wrong go and my dumb
Brothers keep stressing, no shorties the one
To make it real snappy, and little nasty-nasty
Things get pawsie-pawsie
And of to be hax me
It'll little gone and still can hold you on, on
Microphone so keep licking on that wish bone
You had you're chans but you feld out on tune
So you're hanging out with deuce, now you say that rock rues
You make me laugh as you're mom's get smoke
You get ain't like a taffy, and red like the chokes
Flow with the flow from the Wu-tang free-style
You catch yo bow-bow, And they're two's this wild, child
From the Staten the Island, the temple
Just an exemple how pop goes the pistol

Chorus (x2)
One's for the money
Two's for the show
Three's for ya hooker
But we all say, HOE!

Here comes the shortie with the tec twenty two
But If you tell Im gonna blast you
From the projects worst ghetto section
So my back but gun from protection
Shortie do-wa, more shoops and tupa'
Come and do with the Wu-tang hip-hop
Shortie wa-wa, shorts sniki sha-sha
Go-go, ga-ga, now you want me popa
Im not a mack daddy or my daddy mack
Touch my napsack, boy you gettin' pitch smack
I've got a style may not be formilliar
It's like both way you're callin' round in a cosha
Who will be the next to flex and face death
Ashes to ashes, and only dust is left

Chorus (x2)
One's for the money
Two's for the show
Three's for ya hooker
But we all say, HOE![Hook: Shyheim]
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Went through the rain and pain...

[Shyheim]
Me and the older gods -- would build for hours
Tradin' stories, about this fucked up life for ours
There was space between our ages, but through pain we related
And they helped me understand, clear picturers they painted
I'mma fall back, with a blank stare and listen, it's true
You can meet your best friend or enemy in prison
Zero two eight, three eight seven three was my den
I brushed my hair like Chicago, trynna get my waves to spin
Read more books than I ever did, from the Art of War and Seduction
To different shit on black heritage
I wrote mad people, who never responded
I was hurt, and disappointed, cuz I felt that we bonded
But you know, out of sight, out of mind, home boy, you know the saying
Shit was all about me, and even I couldn't change it
C.O.'s was hillbilly bastards, devil racist crackers
When I see tattoo's of a noose and a hangin' black kid
One said "Franklin, when you go home, come back with a friend"
The Willie Lynch letter, the slavery blueprint
It's still in effect, that's why at night when I sleep I sweat

[Hook 2X: Shyheim]
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Went through the rain and pain, losin' sunshine and joy

[Shyheim]
Motivation, dedication, impatience would change my situation
I'm about facin', walkin' the other day, towards better days
A double L A H, I be what them letters say
Show and prove that through my ways and actions
Action and ways, used to be a mental slave
Til Supreme Mathematics, broke the chains
Now I'm free, no long confined, I'm doing time
But yeah, guess what, I'm makin' it, worth for me
Educational informations, the key to success
To reproduce is the only reason, I have sex
Wifey's a queen, I put the crown on her dome
My first priority's gettin' home, I put my deepest thoughts
Into a poem, and draw hearts around the paper
To show my appreciation to the art, player
But the stocks is up, 99, point 9 percent, for the haters
My boy homey told me, "Shy stay sucker free
And when you touchdown, holla at me"
That's real talk....

[Hook 2X]

[Shyheim]
Peace Dad, what up, it's aight in this jail, how is it in that jail?
Talk Mathematics cuz you know these crackers readin' our mail
Pops, I feel pain like you feel, you always be my hero
Don't ever feel like you failed
Remember we bumped heads in Transit, back in July
Those shackles, couldn't touch, but we hug with our eyes
I realized, Dad, we had the same sneakers on, with the same size
Same green, same shirt, man that shit hurt
Mommy used to tell me that you was a dead beat
Cuz you chose the wrong people in the midtown street
Jostlin', hustlin', three card monty
All you ever wanted to give me was Atari
Now we up north, eatin' rice, Jack mac and calamaris, daddy, I'm sorry
I miss you, I love you, it wasn't worth it
Pardon the noise, but nobody's perfect

[Hook 4X]

[Outro: Shyheim]
Been to hell and back, man, like 3 or 4 times
Man I was up north man, my moms up north
My pops up north, man, this my life, man
Hip hop's my life, so when y'all miss jewels in this shit, man
I take it personal... so don't be suprised man
If I start snatchin' y'all drugs, snatchin' y'all mics at the shows
Cuz I take it as you're mimickin' my life, like y'all mockin' this shit, man
Like y'all makin' fun of me, man.... Man, listen, my niggas
Man, let's get money, let's stay g'd up, man, let's go, to the top, man

Song: See What I See

Verse One:

I wake up to another day of life and wish I didn't
Cuz my records predicted a future of Bill Clinton
But I continue to do my thang to make a livin
Fuck the police and Judge Brennan cuz I ain't givin in
I'm cops so say the notorious killa
Last seen in the hilla in a black vigga
Smokin' lye with an unidentified man
The feds believe it was a member of the clan
A wild nigga so jiggy better be cautious
Fuck wit Delores Im bringin 50 crime bosses
From BK to Jersey niggas wanna murder me
Ain't nuttin sweet kid they bettah bring their whole army
Fake ass gangstaz pretend to be killaz
End the drama with a slug from the 4-5th for real uh

1 - Makin green for the next man
Money ?strugglin plans for the dividends
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see
(repeat)

Verse Two:

Same shit different day I scheme to make the paper
God dreams of livin large makin niggas steal and rob
Fuck the pleadin Ill leave ya bleedin
If ya take to long deliverin
Dividends, see nigga, Im menances like 8 sharp
Cracks on my moms china plate
Bag 'em up and wait till it gets late and hit the gate
Keep my eyes open cuz po po they be keepin
They tryin to get locked on Friday and spend the weekend
Then on ruckus island adolescents be watchin
So when Im in the four buildin Im hollerin Staten Island
With my ? in my hand like a 4-5th
The first nigga to fake a move is gettin phillied with the quickness
I'm hip to this wild ass game called street life
It's a cut throat BI with mens who live trife
You Squig you my nigga (no doubt to the death)
I got the isle in my right hand so son part in the left
And let's go to war I got a tech and nine and 3 3-80's
Straight from Haiti, Ill turn a nigga into gravy
And fuck the media ? ? put this on the news
Cause its so safe to know the notorious rulz

Repeat 1

(fade)Yeah yeah
Where my Shaolin peoples at
Stapleton, the craziest, y'all know what time it is
Wild wild West
Now born, Killa Hill, poor to the rich man
Jungle Nilz, let's get money y'all

[Verse 1: Shyheim]
It be the Cess and Hennessey that make me act like this
I'm wild hit ‘em up projects style never plead the fifth
Regardless, to the charges, chickenheads will be at court
Fightin’ and slicin’ each other to see who lies at my fort
Who woulda thought, little Shy Big Willie
Ninety-six we rollin dutches, nine-trey it was Phillies
First of the month be like Christmas to dealers
Hundred dollar sales come through the school zone area
Children at play keep the heat on the low
Little kids getting’ hit, projects flooded with po'
Now shorty's rockin’, Versace and Donna Karan
Playin’ the Miss Mob Queen role knowin’ hon the cousin Sharon
I live the glamorous life, girl
To go from limos with Don Perignon, rich hotels

[Verse Two: Squig]
Facing two-five to life incarcerated activated
Stressed behind a cell with no way to escape it
Holdin’ on, true to ‘ock steel tryin’ to appeal
Be landed without a bail so let the commisary reveal
I feel it's time, for me to let this sparklin' wine
Wet my throat rockin’ the trenchcoat, flashin to get mine
Not hesitant, cause the Henny keeps me bent
Just tryin’ to make a cent, diggin’ pockets down to the lint
Regardless of all the charges the D's want me for
Warrant after warrant, so I avoid the law
Stapleton on the rise, twenty-seven where it lies
From day one until they none don't take it as no surprise

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Shyheim]
I'm havin’ suicidal thoughts cause I'm screwed up in the game
But today's thang, is to hold it down and maintain
I got thirty days until I get remanded for this gun charge
Still I'm livin’ large, joint hard up in the mode and
Long sexin’, fishin’ for pre-model
I'm young black rich and dangerous, livin’ like I won the lotto
So ‘nough of wine sex and dutches
Them kids know who us is
GP Wu, hundred-twenty-seven hustlers
Runnin’ from D's when they try to bust us
Fly crimes and gats, mainly black cops, them faggots love us
And my district attorneys wanna send me to jail
I told em, "People wanna kill me, that's why I had the nine milli’’
I bust ‘em dead and not to injure
Remember what I quote
Before you, enter my center

[Hook repeats until fade][Scratches: DJ Premier]
Bust a move, we show and prove

[Verse 1: Scoob]
Ha ha, hey hey, laugh now nigga
My man's right behind you, Kane pull the trigger
I don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real
And I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon' rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hair and you still can't get no part
You couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playing cards
But if I got beef then it's time for code red
My gun is like a ho, it be taking mad niggas to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join the army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from? England, you somebody great?
You burning Scoob, "I don't think so mate"
I got the style that get you open like a bag of smoke
I'll have your friends saying "Ah man, that shit is dope"
Leave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone
And play like E.T. and phone your black ass home
Yo Sauce, if you're down with the groove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Verse 2: Sauce]
Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
How you got dope like Sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
NBA style, fantastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight
I write left-handed cause I like to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win lose or draw, I'm booking whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie
If I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty
Sucking and lucking, hey, niggas I'm ducking, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So Shyheim, if you're down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Verse 3: Shyheim]
I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a Metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killing
When I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
Cause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia
If your shit stinks I'mma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from Cali son
My jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the F in effin foul
The Rugged Child lock shit down like Rikers Isle
And got more girls than a trailer load with Shabba
More Super than Cat, I'm the punani Don Dada
So Big Daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Verse 4: Big Daddy Kane]
Now tell me who is the man?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And stepping to me, thinking I can be touched?
Not even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, Jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What I just shown ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leaving rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me
But with that speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistable, non-competible
No No No I'm not saying I'm the best
I'm just saying I'm fucking incredible
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So Jay-Z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Verse 5: Jay-Z]
One checking it two, checking it three
Check out the J, check out the A, check out the Y, check out the Z
Aight G!
I'm breaking MC's up like EPMD
And these nuts if you rappers trying to see me
I'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow
I've been in it running a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal
Uhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggas can't fuck with
The, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eating me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like Prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it
Till you try it, once you start, you can't stop it
I'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be
Between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound
I know you loving the way it's, goin down baby
So Ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya
Get on the mic and show and prove

[Verse 6: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Come on
Wu-Tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a flick, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream "Ow!"
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like "Well god damn what's the recipe?"
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
She says "Go ask your goddamn father!"
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas think they all that, yo, that shit is G
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame
How many enemies wanna claim the name
Of Ason, who carries on like a manager
Yo! Sounds fly, right?
Danger!!![Ghostface Killah]
Yo yo yo whassup where my team where my team at?
C'mere y'all c'mere c'mere, circle around me y'all circle around me
Yo Timbo check it you bring the motherfuckin rock up
Sin Dreddy y'all niggas is forwards
Shyheim, I want you on guard
Tekitha baby girl yo check it you play center
Let's rip these niggas asses, c'mon kid
Word up, run

[Tekitha]
Hole... hole... oh oh ohhhh

[Timbo King]
We be a team, cause everybody plays a part in this
Ain't no chuckin, we comin from the parks where the gun sparks
After dark, you got your three point shooters
Scrubs who quick to fire out cause your style is out
We drinkin quarts on courts so how you handle it
Shootin bricks or sellin bricks, we still scramblin
With offense and defense, I use the bassline
To score points frequent

Yo, yo
Yo check the mic so I can slam without a crossover
Wack jump shot punk rock players get tossed over
By the bleachers, I'm bringin pressure like a power foward
You try to walk and get away with it the ref saw it
Your startin five couldn't get verbal live
I penetrate across the lane, all reasons mines
Percentage from the field is real, we hard boilin
Swish shot in your face, your coach is callin
For a timeout, I bomb your rhyme out, with a free throw
Fast break through the legs crush your rookie ego
You steppin out of bounds son, now how that sound Dunn
I thought we was playin ball, don't start at round one

[Ref - Dreddy Kruger]
Time the fuck out!
I got a illegal defense on the wack MC
Number four, you can't be doin that shit
Hold on God, peace God, hold on, hold on
(Killa Sin: Oh shit I'm snuffin you!)

[Tekitha]
Soul... in the hole...
Soul... in the hole...

[Shyheim]
I know niggas liver than Allen Iverson
Take it to the hole and roll it in, triple-double in
Suicide drills get your cavs built
Crossovers ill, have you thinkin water split
With the 2-3 zone we smoke em, like bones
And with the W-I-N, we, punchy at home
Sore losers take off they jersey, cause they ain't James Worthy
Your bitch mad cause they ain't get they hands dirty
Lame, better not open up that Gatorade
Until you game sport, hit the gym and train
Do some jumping jacks and situps, then maybe you can get up
But as for now the scoreboard gets lit up
Take you down the middle, and throw it all day
We number one draft pick W-S-A
Nigga, you can't stop my J
How I do it everyday

[Killa Sin]
Yo, we throwin 52 blocks at outside shots to bubble up the snot box
No penalties or shot blocks, it's similar to Comstock kid
You catch an elbow in this hell Hole of concrete
Add a touch of Soul before we compete
You better have your Vietnam fleet my squad deep like Ethiopians
Peep me in the open and I'm closin in
Focus on the broken rim now, we shake a bone out your stand
Toss a backpass, with enough force that it'd crack glass
We celebratin at last for stoppin you
So take your sorry black ass, back to the lockerroom, yo
My team work to make your team hurt, we pullin up skirts
So back down, before these Wu niggas tear the fuckin shot down
What what what? No doubt, no doubt
We got the all-star lineup here
Y'all niggas better sign up for my team kid, for real

[Tekitha]
Soul... in the hole...
Soul... in the hole...
Soul... in the hole...
So-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ul... in the ho-oh-le-le-le-le, Soul
