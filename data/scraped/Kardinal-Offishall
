[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Kardinal Offishall]

High heels push up ya ass last name

Goddess, watch my girl and how she hot dress

[Hook] - first 6 lines w/ ad libs

[Akon]
You're so beautiful[Verse 1 – T-Pain]
Welcome to epicness, I’m so dope and it’s effortless
Yeah I’m tryna brag and boast
If you looking for the shit nigga step in this
Disa my ting, hoes in back room kissing my ring
Ready for the day, hit me with the Visine
Getting to the money, counting up the ice cream
Me a baller boy, she with me, you better not call her boy
I'mma pass her round to all my boys
Cause she want the nuts like Almond Joy
Yeah, price tag don’t matter
If it ain’t about money then it’s just chit chatter
Bank account steady climbing up the ladder
You can literally see all of my pockets getting fatter
But I’m over your head
Southern folk prolly getting swole in the head
But your girlfriend calling, wait
Something just broke in the bed
Nappy boy, win squad, nigga that’s my team
Balling, stunting, drinking, smoking, nigga
Disa my ting!

[Hook – KK Holliday]
Disa my sound an ah me have di crown
Cause disa my ting
An ah me start the style, an ah me drive dem wild
Cause disa my ting
If you waah make ah money then yuh affi work fah mi

Cause disa my ting
Here we go, hurry up, hurry up
Fuck nigga, disa my ting
Bitch nigga, disa my ting
Pussy hole, disa my ting
Disa my ting, disa my ting

[Verse 2 – T-Pain]
Pimping since been pimp ass nigga
Whipping expensive whips ass nigga
They be tryna hold me but they know I got a Rolex that’ll make your fucking wrist go limp my nigga
You a zip my nigga, I bet your pocket full of lint my nigga
Errybody knows that I put it on these hoes
Got it sounding like a motherfucking chimp, my nigga
Welcome to the jungle dog, Balenciaga by the bundles dog
My bitch got to put a helmet on
My wide receiver don’t fumble balls
I’m rich as fuck and y’all like that shit
Smoke good nigga, light that spliff
Throwing money in the club, make it right back bitch
And I’m drinking like I don’t know what a nightcap is
Cause I ball too much, money too heavy and I’m [?] crutch
Get a quarter pound of the kush, fuck around later on put it all in the dutch
Nappy boy, win squad, nigga that’s my team
Balling, stunting, drinking, smoking, nigga
Disa my ting!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Kardinal Offishall]
Yo fuck boy disa my ting
When the girl dem  see me
Dem say this is my king
Ay boy mi no really care
If you no like him
T Pain  ah mi  dog, big up the Vikings
Physics couldn’t see me when I’m on a mission
No sidekick, just a nigga with a trigger and a cool head
Pause for the cause, I’m a boss for the boss
I’m an OG with a G tucked in my drawers
I’m ahead of my time, with an animal rhyme
Like [?] when it’s Busta Rhymes
Got to finesse all my lines, got to impress all the dimes
When they see me right away they know disa my ting
I don’t play no games, yo this is my ring
Champion team, autograph the jersey
Melt them bars like Hershey
Lot of mercy, purse me, just don’t push me
Don’t make me lift up your skirt, expose your nature
I don’t rate ya, to me your garbage
Couple bodyguards, don’t make it the hardest
Artist, no sir, just a punk in a fur
I’m a hunk, and I don’t smoke skunk, just [?]
The bass been in your trunk, clip your wing
If a pussy wanna test [?], disa my ting

[Hook][Hook: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher then leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Hook]* first single

[Intro/Hook: Akon]
Girl I can't notice but to
Notice you, noticin' me
From across the room, I can see it
And can't stop myself from lookin' at
Noticin' you, noticin' me
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous, that girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous, that girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
(Whoah!) An' yeah that's her
The big dog tryin' to get her little kitty to purr
Ex-man lookin' at me like I'm Lucifer
Cause he knows how I deal with the case (yes sir)
If I was the last man on earth
I would only take that girl, end of search
She give a new definition to the word curve
Got chicks in the strip club envying her
Body's like weapons of mass eruptions
Sit her glass on that fat obstruction
Tongue game give a new type seduction
I'm tryin' to give that girl somethin', jah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
(Whoah!) Bad to the bone
Everything locked like a two three zone
I wanted to make my black snake moan
Talk a likkle bit then take that home
She bad and she know the deal
That's what I can't hide when she wanna conceal
I mean Meagan Good and Halle Berry
Put together, ain't close to the dribby I see
No, no, no disrespect
But this gyal upon another level, cut the check
Tell King, Max stop the press
Say kid, can I get a witness?

[Hook]

[Bridge: Akon]
I see you got that fire
By the way that you walkin' (walkin')
From left to right I watched her go down
Girl I just want it right now
Don't wanna do no talkin' (talkin')
Shorty's so right I need to slow down

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
Figure eight, good body shape
When she on the dance floor, gyal dem irate
When she do her ting' man can't walk straight
That biscuit fi' soak up erry-ting' on her plate
Bad heels like Jessica P
I'm tryin' to give homegirl Sex and the City-titty
Itty bitty waistline, moves with the baseline
One lick of punch, I'm fine
Jah!

[Hook][Intro: Method Man]
Uh.. that's right, oh yeah
Back with some nasty shit, right there
Nasty, nasty, girl, nasty girl, baby come on
Think you a nasty girl, yea

[Method Man]
Pretty young thing like to bone
And she hate to spend her nights alone, baby doll you in the zone
Why not call me on the phone, and invite me home
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Know what I mean, take a real queen to fuck with me
Trustin' me, and give it up for free
Next time, feel free to hit me up, anything you wanna puff a tree
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Whats shaking yo, stop stallin', what you waitin' for?
You know we both ain't got no place to go
So roll it up, and lay low
Everytime I say, yes, baby, you say no
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Now-now, now-now-now, you don't have to stay
It's ok, there's the dough, you can walk away, why make we wait
Til tomorrow, when you can break me off today
Come on, now, baby, come on-on

[Hook: Kardinal Offishall]
Yeah! Gal dem we love, and gal we need
She crush up me things and light me weed
We see dem shotgun, and watch me speed
Me need a pringy one or pon we need it
Gal dem we *ugh*, and gal we screw
When we need the girl, up one night po' half me crew
And lick on my collection, and what to do
Me need a nasty girl, it could be you, eh!

[Method Man]
I won't lie, I love P-U-S-S-Y, (why?)
Cuz I never let it walk on by, or any slice of the american pie
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Girlfriend, you know it's half past two A.M
You got a friend, but you ain't really trynna fuck with him
Aight, then, hit up Batty, I'll gladly come and tuck you in
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Scream at your frog, all's fair, love & basketball
She remind me of this chick that used to fuck with Dirty Bastard, ya'll
Heard that she could suck a ball through a plastic straw
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Know what I'm sayin', kid, she get it poppin' off and half the time
A little, candlelight, a little glass of wine
I'm thinkin', another drink and that ass is mine
Come on, now, baby, come on-on

[Hook]

[Method Man]
If you girl come knockin' at my door, it's my duty
To give her what she came here for
I'm try'nna knock it down, but I ain't try'nna claim that dough
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
That's what's up, start the fire, Buddha, light things up
The only nigga puttin' ends on some rims for his ice cream truck
Pick a flavor, I'll come and scoop your whole team up
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
That's how it be, don't trip, but girl you put a hurtin' on me
Oh shit, hope other chicks don't take it personally
But ma, you killin' her, murder in the first degree
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Okay, okay, can the ladies come out and play with Mr. Meth
I ain't trynna take you out your way
Why break me off tomorrow, when you can break me off today
Come on, now...

[Hook]

[Outro: Method Man]
Me need a nasty girl, it could be you, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Big up to, super producer, Fafu, one love to Kardinal Offishall
And the whole T-Dot, oh![All]
When I get older
I will be stronger
They’ll call me freedom
Just like a wavin flag

[K'naan]
Born from a throne
Older than Rome
But violent prone
Poor people zone

[Nelly Furtado]
But it’s my home
All I have known

[Sam Roberts]
Where I got grown
But now its gone

[Avril Lavigne]
Out of the darkness
In came the carnage
Threatening my very survival

[Pierre Bouvier of Simple Plan]
Fractured my streets
And broke all my dreams

[Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman]
Feels like defeat to wretched retreat

[All]
So we strugglin’

[Kardinal Offishall]
Fighting to eat

[All]
And we wonderin’

[Kardinal Offishall]
If we’ll be free

[Jully Black]
We cannot wait for some faithful day
It’s too far away so right I’ll say

[All - Hook]
When I get older
I will be stronger
They’ll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag
(And then it goes back x3)

Ahhho ahhho ahhho

[Lights]
So many wars, settling scores
[Deryck Whibley of Sum 41]
All that we’ve been through
And now there is more
[Serena Ryder]
I hear them say love is the way
[Jacob Hoggard of Hedley]
Love is the answer that’s what they say
[Emily Haines]
But were not just dreamers
Of broken down grievers
[Hawksley Workman]
A hand will reach us
And will not forsake us
[Drake]
This can’t control us
No it can’t hold us down
[Chin Injeti]
We gon pick it up even though we still struggling
[Pierre Lapointe]
Au nom de la survie (In the name of survival)
[All]
And we wondering
[Pierre Lapointe]
Battant pour nos vie (Fighting for our lives)

[All]
We patiently wait
For some other day
[Fefe Dobson and Esthero]
Thats too far away so right now we say

[All - Hook]

[Drake - Rapping]
Uhh – well alright
How come when the media stops covering
And there’s a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again, nahh
See we don’t have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren’t involved before it’s never too late to start
You probably think that it’s too far to even have to care
Well take a look at where you live what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again

[Nikki Yanofsky & Drake]
When I get older
I will be stronger
They’ll call me freedom
Just like a wavin’ flag

[Matt Mays]
And then it goes back
[Justin Nozuka]
And then it goes back
[Nikki Yanofsky]
Then it goes back

[Hook - All]

[Justin Bieber]
When I get older
When I get older
I will be stronger
Just like a waving flag[Hook x2: Wrekonize & Bernz]
If we're all connected then how do I unplug
How do I break free from all these drugs that I love?
Tryna find a place in heaven next to the sun
And hope that I’m awake the day the end finally comes

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Everybody wanna think they free
All the while they locked in tightly
Livin for the rush, quick on the clutch
I’ve been low and I’ve been fucked up
I’ve been rich and I’ve been a bum
Seen it all and I snorted once
Roll it up and smoked it in blunts
On the road for what seemed like months
When I get up in the morning gotta greet the sun and stretch out these lungs
Some pay a high price for they ones
But not me, I’m a hard headed not to puff to fly off the cuff
But not us, I’m tired of fighting shadows in the dusk
Moving on but I gots no rush
Guess I’m in love with the pain, what can I say?
And I put this on my mama
It’s death before dishonor
I’ve been living by a code, it’s been extinct to these fake prima donnas
We piranhas, we survivors
We some unemployed 9 to 5’ers
Tryna express the pain that’s inside us
Tryna touch some gold just like Midas
Fuck what these haters gonna say
They hate themselves more than they hate me
No more trying and a straight face
Mr. Nice Guy died with EMJ
And I’m still yelling where you’ve been
While I give em all a taste of they medicine
Maybe one day I’mma see my friend
But until then I’mma say..

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
How do I unplug from the people I’ve been connected to for the longest?
Niggas that I’ve been rocking with from the beginning of time
Knowin damn well they ain’t the strongest
I ain’t perfect, far from Jesus
But I’m tryna change my global ovation
Things playin over and over and over
Inside of my head but I can’t change the station, Nathan damn
Maybe this blunt will help
A little kush but I ain’t smoked in about ten years
Used to move with a multitude of men
But now I’m down to about 10 peers
All my tears gone with beers
I ain’t equipped to deal with the way it really feels
I’m plugged in to the outer-net
What I’m really popping up is in the really really real no
Some do coke to try to escape
Some drink away the pain and rush to get baked
Shit, I gotta resist that
Gotta figure out what I’m really pissed at
My uncle told me the way the long life is to live yo life stress free
So I turn the other cheek and pretend like everything is everything but this shit still stress me
What am I to do? How am I to beat that?
It’s like I live where the lies and the cheats at
And the good guys seem to finish last
And I haven’t figured out how I’m gonna defeat that
I'm just gonna do me regardless
Living the best life’s always the hardest
Tryin to chase after tomorrows
And disconnect and connect with our father

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Is it me you grieve? Or just the reason's key?
You can be free to flee but please just do it vis-à-vis
Unplugged from negatives like it’s the only option, kid
But just grow up and speak this shit
Don’t do me like Robert did
Trike try for fowl
But above the other ruckus
He wasn’t even man enough to be a motherfucker
Digital deviant, the predatory pedophile
Who’s metamorphis set a pile of shit up under my pedophiles
You’ve met him out
Getting drunk and smothering women, chedda-style
Poking up under the devil’s isles
You’re joking, brother would never foul, psych!
Wrong, terminate the fact you even give a damn
Punch him dead in his Facebook, I’m down by where my limits land
Wait, cause here’s the fuckin' kicker man
See I got mental pics for life so why did I even block your Instagram
I’m killin' links to blink and thin the fam
They just connect us to direct us so I’ll never fully skip your RAM!

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]

I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news, but most news
Is filled with nothing but street blues
Mothers crying, so much chalk outlining
I’m finding it’s like we rewinding
Time after time, they don’t listen to “Self Destruction”, and they busting
Community cussing, “Fuck ‘em!’
They’re part of the design
The younger generation is lost, but not mine
Not my seed --No! The team of street dreamers outside my window
That’s letting the Moss blow
See my youth out playing, I see them but yo, it takes a village to raise them
And all the talking won’t phase them
While we scream “‘F’ The Police!”, and please don’t snitch
All the bad mine, youths outside will not switch
Shoulda got a switch from the diaper itch
Used to be rap, now the simps is too quick to say ‘Bitch!’
Yosemite Sam, toting two rifles
The law or something more keeps my two feet idle in the struggle

[Hook: Kardinal Offishall]
See my two feet, they stand up in the struggle
Niggas hustle and get to muscle up , get big checks. they run this here
See my two feet, they stand up in the struggle
Niggas hustle and muscle up rude boys around this here
See my two feet, they stand up in the struggle
Niggas hustle and and muscle up, coming at you with no fear

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]

Coming down, like “Blaow!”
Buckshot season peppers the block
While the Mighty Ducks creep, keep my weapons unlocked
Machete your mind flow, caravanner rhyme flow
Carnival Parade, High Grade got my eyes low
David House affiliated, ‘Firepower’ rap blaze
Dilated ‘Marathon’, we outrunning the rat race
Like Prince in the “Black” Rain , or Jimmy in “Black” Haze
See me in that Black Range, I'm rollin’ with Black Jays
Black Panthers, Brown Berets
Revelation’s in effect, count down the days
Chant down Babylon, kneel down and pray
Make a point with every thorn in my Crown displayed
L-Dot-A-Dot, T-D-O-T
Beatwise, killin’ whatever bangs, we O-G
I’m Rakaa, I’m too strong, your weak, you’re too sweet
These streets will lift you two feet, off your two feet[Intro: Method Man]
Uh.. that's right, oh yeah
Back with some nasty shit, right there
Nasty, nasty, girl, nasty girl, baby come on
Think you a nasty girl, yea

Half the time we talking about 'more times'

Y'all talkin about 'that nigga's a punk'
We talkin about 'dat yute's a fosse'
For the kids that think I'm comin wit it

Ya'll takin about 'watch where you goin!'
We talkin about 'mind where you step!'

And if you runnin out of liquor the bar might get wet
You're talkin about 'yo, that girl's hype'

You talkin about 'yeah son!'

CHORUS

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo instead of your boys
We talkin about 'di man dem'
When talkin about 'your bredrin
Yo we talkin about 'your friend'
When you say 'the club is over'
Yo we say 'di jam dun'
When you're thinkin about the west, we thinkin about Red-1
Big ups and salutations to the Figure IV crew
When you're sayin 'she's a chicken'
She a 'skettlebam too!'
When you talkin about a 'thug nigga'
We talkin about a 'shotta'
When you think you got it locked, T dot comin much hotta
You think we all Jamacian, when nuff man are Trini's
Bajans, Grenadians and a hole heap of Haitians
Guyanese and all of the West Indies combined
To make the T dot O dot, one of a kind
Irs said 'we burn kahn' that mean 'they puff lah'
When we say 'hell no', that means you 'dat nuh mek it'
Look me in the eye and tell me y'all ain't sold

Hey yo 'kon. We keep givin it to them every day my nig

[Verse One]
Ahhh shit here we go again
I'm lookin' at you but I'm seein' your friend
Both my hands fit around her waist
Her astronauts takin' up my space yo
I'm about to launch my rocket
Take off!
Your clothes and reach in my pocket
Grab the controller, similar to Wii
It's a game and I'mma let you beat me

[Akon]
Shawty's body's like an hourglass, that's no lie
You know if she bring it to me
The cash bout to fly, man
I'm so ready for her, I wanna throw it so fast
But I just wait to show her the blast

[Verse Two] [Kardinal]
Bounce, twerk
Show me a little work
I'mma take them calories off with that shirt
Look how you bouncin'
All of the sudden I think how many men try to climb that mountain
Them heels you got is no joke
Even Akon might go broke
Spendin' them ones, throwin' them twenties
I'm in love in the back throwin' up centuries
That's the body of the century
You a little insecure but baby you got plenty
Them stretch marks on your hips
Is just bungee cords bringin' you back when you dip
I read your lips, my game stay literate
I ain't scared, not a little bit
Gotta let you know
You're worth about a million ounce
Now just bounce

Either we bouncin' right now or your dirt off the shoulder

Mr. Material
Let me feel on your birthday suit texture so resilient
I like how on the inside its like a wetsuit brilliant
Water resistant up to 9 inches
Wrap that, let me open it up like Christmas
I'm about the same height as Sidris
Keep on your heels, let's get down to business
No gym but I'm seein' your fitness
With my eyes closed you pose as a witness
Every word the body language you pronounce

Tongue game give a new type seduction

Right past the poor in clothes they can't afford
For this, I thank the Lord
Wish, that he will be bless me with a few more
Quick, cause working in a drought is a bitch
Switch, a female dog with no raw, rich
Is what I wanna get like gifts
But you need blow to get your birthday wish
Trip, and then you never snitch
You never tell a soul, not even a fish
Cause fish might fold, and run and tell the shrimp, ya dig?
And shrimp might run and tell the pigs
That you selling rides on the white horse right up out your crib
Bring﻿ the battering ram where you live
God, I really need a job, until I get a gig
I be giving work to the kids

[Verse 2: Wale']
And I be on the block all day
They block my pay then I Glock on face (fast)
Can't no Matlock lock me
Not likely, like Fei Long, please
I am Ryu-like to the fiend
And my hadouken is watch how I do them, see
Fire in the hand, supplier of the man
In the corner just laying by the store selling beers
Passion in life he has lost
His dreams gone dry, that's why he on water
Something in his arm, he pushing more and more
He pushing cause he's low, to be higher with the Lord
I ride with the law (NEVER!)
I'm here to make it better
I give him what I measure, and now the pain lessens
Enough to paint a picture, my true profession
Streets is calling square niggas leave a message
One

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
I ain't push no rocks in about nine months
I switched genres to the ganja
And I'm about to let go altogether
Trade in my white tee for a tie and a sweater
Life is a bitch so a G can't sweat her
But she sure can get you high if the coke let her
The straight life's like a sedative, everything's cool
No David Lettermans' acting a fool
Tryna run up on me late nights with the lights flashing
Nina on my femur is cocked ready for action
Seldomly blasting I would stomp you without asking
If you didn't have the price I'm asking
And I'm the Bob Barker of the trap and field
I don't sprint just boost when I feel
Since the birth of my son, the street life losing appeal
Ghost in the hook so real
Singing

You see I, am an everyday rudebwoy
I'm an everday rudebwoy, yes I am, yeah
You see I, am an everyday rudebwoy

[Kardinal Offishall]
(Yeah, Celebrity Face, ain't it true enough?)
So where I rest I'm stressed by the 5-0 (Here we go)
Cops drive around the turf, lookin' for someone to search
With they flashlights checkin' in my dashboard
(Whatchu lookin' for?)
Or lookin' for the heat stashed under the seat
But I'm a rudebwoy, plus everything is legit (You knew it)
Worked too damn hard for my things (That's right)
I'm a celeb, I heard +99 Problems+
But understand that every rudebwoy is a king
So we watched, no face, and just play along
Everything I own's bling to the ding (Dun'know)
Them niggas think they have me shook but they dead wrong
Them pigs vexed Kardi youth have a little bit of fame
Didn't find nothin', so they screw-faced
Plus I never ever once lost my cool (No way!)
It's just a story of an everyday black man
Give thanks that the beast never pulled out they tools

[Hook: Ray Robinson]
You see I, yes I am an everyday rudebwoy
I am an everyday, an everyday rudebwoy
I'm an everyday rudebwoy, I'm an everyday rudebwoy

[Kardinal Offishall]
I used to check this girl off in the West set
Had a baby girl by some dude
I used to hear second-hand from her brethren
That the youth was vexed, "Yo Kardinal I need food"
I used to hang with the girl every now and then
First met her chillin' out at the club
Body bangin' like she was in King magazine
Chopped her still, even though I wasn't rollin' on dubs
She used to live in the middle of the ghetto
Chickens yellin' on the block in the hood
Sometimes I used to hear the shots bellow
But they respect what I'm doin', so you know it's all good
So as I'm rollin' off, the baby father rollin' out
The youth lookin' at me dead in my eye
I said "You should have stuck it out with your family
But now that's girl's mean, so don't screw-face me!"
Because...

[Hook: Ray Robinson]
I am an everyday rudebwoy, I'm an everyday
I am an everyday rudebwoy, I'm an everyday
I am an evI am an everyday rudebwoy, yes I am
I'm a rudebwoy yes eryday rudebwoy, everyday, everyday yeah

This is a story of my everyday, what!

Ray Rob, Kardinal
(I'm a rudebwoy yes, I'm a rudebwoy yes
Oh yeah, yeah)[Intro]
It is eight o'clock here in Kingston, Jamaica. The Kingston police have issued an APB out for wanted criminal Rostacious Johnson. He has last been seen headed towards The United States of America or Canada. If you have any info, please call us right away

[Hook: Ro Dolla]
I was a gangsta
Livin' my life hustlin' on the block, with no food to eat
Rollin' with them prankstas
Settin' the streets on fire with the heat
I had no choice as a gangsta
Livin' my life hustlin' on the block, with no food to eat
Rollin' with them prankstas
Settin' the streets on fire with the heat

[Kardinal Offishall]
Aiyyo, stepped off the Air Jamaica at the age of 10
Landed at the Dot airport, coming out of May Pen
Raised by his grandmother, until his real mother
Could send for the youth, and reunite, aiight?
So now he's growin' up exposed to the ghetto limelight
No pops (nope) plus his moms got to work nights
Moonlightin' as a janitor, to make bread for the two
All the while he's growin' up, runnin' with a crew
It started off tryin' to make a little extra creamer
But then it turned to pushin' rocks, savin' for the Beamer
Told his moms he got a job workin' in the trade
At a local grease monkey, that's how he's gettin' paid
And that's how he got the deal on the black man wagon
Moms thought it was suspect, but she's still braggin'
To her kin about "How he come home and grow right"
All the while he's wildin' out, money starts pilin' now
The next crew saw the flex and start red eye
Jealous of the way them niggas hustle
Til he get a little muscle, uh huh, bust a bunch of shots
There my nigga laid, really holdin' down the block
That nigga gangsta

[Hook: Ro Dolla]

[Kardinal Offishall]
Aiyyo, 6 weeks in Intensive, holding on to prayers
On the 7th, he was back on his back in the west wing
His man dem came visiting, in his ear whispering
How the block was hot, and there was nuff shots whistling
Another week and he was back on his feet
Discharged, ready to get back and hit the street
Moms was still working overtime, clueless to the real
About how his son was living in the hood packin' steel
Pushin' coke - no joke - them cats wanted retaliation
Word got back, about who led the slaughter
One nigga named Blaka, real name Elroy
Next day *gunshot* what happened to that boy?
For the next three months my man stayed on the low
Told his moms he wasn't workin' cause the garage was slow
But just as he tried to resurface on the strip
Someone on the turf called 222-TIPS

[Hook: Ro Dolla]

[Kardinal Offishall]
Now my man locked up, and had to sweat inside a jail
Cause his man done fled the scene, and moms couldn't afford bail
The trial came and went, his mother cried "Discrimination!"
Said the judge didn't know her son
He said he knew him too well, he'd seen him there before
Turned the cheek prior, now he feels he's on fire
Got burned by the same little quick-talkin' freshie
Doesn't know how to act, so now he got to go back
My man got dipped, sent right back to May Pen
Grandma didn't want him now, family wouldn't take him
He thought about work, but he said "F that!"
He got a fake passport and just came right back

[Hook: Ro Dolla] x2

[Outro]
It is a sunny day here in Jamaica. Unfortunately we have bad news to report. Rostacious Johnson was apprehended in Canada, and suffered fatal wounds to the back of the head. Rest in peace, my brother

Everything's official
You ain't gotta ask

You need a late pass
Ya'll need sip punani
Bottle to the head

We stay connected, above the clouds
We don't talk much but the movement speak loud, nigga
Gotta respect that

Girlfriend caught me kickin' with the crew
She my late night friend, butchall

They call me Kardie

World turn to (FIRE!)

And we don't buy it unless we got it ten times
This is real life, we ain't just sitting on the rhymes man
Guaranteed if you're a poser you lose
And we the future, let's hear it for the brand new fusion
Anybody can get it, there is no exclusion
'Nuff questions, leading to the same conclusion
Gangsters is Gangsters

At the end of the night they say

[Third Verse: Kardinal Offishall]

Ey Yo

They call me Kardie
Mr. Evolution
Now you can dance while you think about the revolution
And while you vex having delusions of persecution
I'mma stay flawless, an instrument of execution
Out of many still grows one people
Justice (...) still remain unequal
And I'm a diamond in the dirt
And there is no sequel
Many try but they cannot replicate what we do
Hear evil, speak that evil
Speak good to the hood, there is no retrieval
Think about while you sippin' on your (...)
If my words could talk they'd say

[Hook: T-Pain]

I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
(Now hear the choir say) I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you

Now hear the choir say

Ma, it don't get more ghetto than this[Ex's voice]
I love you!

[Verse One]
Yeah, Hmmm
I guess I could have learned to love you
Replace my sanity
With Kotex on the vanity
Put up with your habits
Reward your anxiety with carats
Substitute freedom for a marriage
I was quite in love with your odd behaviour and acting out
Waited quite a while just to tap you out
Thought you was digging Saukrates
Came to find out that me and you couldn't wait to get down to knocking knees
The first time I dug you out raw!!!
Pussy so good I disobeyed the first law
Never fall hard for the skin too soft
Unless you been through some real shit, beating the odds
Yeah
But I was still in love with my ex
[Ex] Hello?
I erased the pain every time we had (kiss) you know
Looking in your face but thinking about her
It's interesting seeing what we were
I wish I could talk to you

[Hook: Peter Jericho]
We once were
What we are
Never to be again
Now I look back
And laugh now
But it sure wasn't easy then
Loving you and wishing you genuinely felt the same
But it doesn't matter now, that was just a thought
We moved on
I just wanna talk to you

[Verse Two]
Girl you used to impress me
Clean the house and undress me
Giving me the sugar like Nestlé
Never seen a girl from Jamaica who
Came to Toronto and celebrated Canada Day more than Gretzky
Big smiles
But when I found out about your ex man
Being abusive I couldn't understand
How did you believe in that?
You were nothing greater than a whore
Sometimes mental abuse hurts more
So I showed you what love should feel like
Ice cream dates on a late night
Very long talks on the phone
When you would breakdown and you stayed downtown
When you felt you couldn't reach home
I wonder what marriage would feel like
You never left me but something didn't feel right
Your red eyes were spelling it out
And you wondered what the yelling was about
[Ex] Hello?
I wish I could talk to you

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
We almost had a child
But we made mistakes that we couldn't take back
I hope God forgives for that
I used to look up at the moon, waiting outside your workplace
Me and you together seemed good on the surface
Til we flew out to my homeboy's wedding
When they exchanged vows, I knew I wasn't heading
To the same place with you, reality set in
I loved you but didn't like the feelings that you let in
Insecurity, jealousy, envy, no self-esteem
It's like I woke out of a bad dream
All the drinking and the smoking and the going out
Never mind all the shit I ain't know about
I had to free my future
Let go of your grip with Kama Sutra
Sleep alone and feel like I lost my world
My axis was spinning with you girl
The other day I heard my cell phone ring
An unknown caller calling in, hold up
The other day I heard my cell phone ring
An unknown caller calling in
I wish I could talk to you

[Phone Conversation]
[Ex] Hello?
[Kardi] Yo!

Yes sir
When the man wanted to ride, what did he do?
Swing down sweet chariot
He told that sweet chariot to swing on down
And stop, you know what I'm sayin'
So he could get on
Now this is what we do
We playin' we playin' the role of that sweet chariot
And we swingin' down to pick you up
Know what Iim sayin'?
Ride, for real
Now, it's like, you wanna ride with me
You don't even know what ride is, look
You wanna get clean, you wanna get dirty
You wanna go left, right
This what we do

[Choclair]
Well it's the Nocka, The Chiz Rocker
Party while I'm wine drinkin'
My rhymes'll bust a hole right through your thinker
Re-think your stratagies when you battle
Interntational record sales
People try, but they fail
It's the Chizzo, or the Choco
Ran the street like a blocko
Before the shots ring out
People never seen or even heard
But we ran through your HQs
Like a pack of germs, people swerve from the gamer
Suave player, I'm all black like the Raiders
You wonder how I did it, album anticipated
Well it's the ninth inning
With two outs I hit a home run to left field like Carter did to Philly
Do you understand me? Ha, really?
No MacGyver tactics can stop my theatrics
I'm making ladies back flip
Understand it's all about the Sexual eating up your set like a tropical
Stop it, my UVs will burn your skin, singe your optics
Twenty One years was ground work
People hear me coming, so hit up for mad work
But understand it's all about the suave, diggy-dog
Just ride

You see, I flow like an 850, the turbo
Down the lakeshore with po-po chasing
Then you be wastin' your time
{Swing down sweet chariot, stop} X2 in background
If you try to check for flaws
If you bet against Chizz-nocks
Count your loss
See I don't care what you people think or say
What you do, I got a crew that run up in your HQ
Dissed by who, six foot one, sleppy eyed
Dark skinned glasses reflecting from the sun, nigga
Check that poster, I lay your girl down like a coaster
Drop my glass, slap that ass
Don't care about a thing
See it's all about the way Chocs makes the bells ring
People talkin' shit but can't do a damn thing
So understand this, it's all about the lyricist
No one can rock a beat just like I
Borough Side representer, C-H the I-Z
Knows how to ride, understand?
Just ride

All my peoples on Lockdown, you know we can

Me, I love Senoritas, that's where my hearts been
Now I be chillin' with my boys Paranorm'
Having freaks in the living room suckin' it hard
See I don't care what you think, nigga
Yo, I'm laughing at your bitch-ass
So niggas mind you speach when you talk
All these people gettin' mad and vexed
Sayin' all I talk 'bout sex
Make a fuss cause they nuts don't bust
So understand who I is {who you is}
I got an SDS smile, while your girl's got an ass like an E-class
I can drive it like a five-speed, stick shift
Understand the ill shit that I possess, nothin' less
If you stress, you be left blind, so read it up in brail
Hard rock's coming but they always come frail
Collobaration produced by Kardinal
Now if you wanna ride, everybody needs to understand
Just ride

Do you wanna get down with this?
You can if you like
Give me a call
For real[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
I’m a real astrologist, study them curves like a Playboy biologist
Never giving money up, micro economist
Blame it on my sign, I’m a Taurus till the chorus them Scorpios never bore us
I live on the dangerous side, Libras weighing good and evil
Geminis couldn’t decide, My Leos you can hold on to my lion's mane
Now watch me skinny dip with the Aquarius again
Aww here we go talking that bull damn right, me and 11 of em Cancers I pulled over
And the Arieses and the Virgos, I'm virtually compatible with any sign Let me show
Libras how to really lay it down I straight represent
Captain of the Capricorns gain heaven sent
Sergeant of the Sagittarius and Pisces
Lookin’ to the stars, knowing that I’m blessed nicely

[Hook]
Look up and tell me what you see
I will decide my destiny
From the stars to the planets to the moons
Read the signs of astrology and let the sky speak to you
Howling at the moon, born with a lot to say
Lookin’ up at the stars
Let the good times lead the way

[Verse 2: Classified]
Half man half animal I’m ready for departure
We connect the dots, try to figure how the stars work
I’mma Sagittarius the hard headed archer
Coming with bow and arrows to puncture your bone marrow
I’m so unusual, I’m feeling optimistic
I ain’t scared to take a risk kid, I’m scared I’ll miss it
Can’t sit in one place, I’m restless and reckless
Everything I’m blessed with, I stay overprotective
They say I’m superficial but I’m just misunderstood
Loyal to my brotherhood and do it like no other could
Look up to the stars I’m finally exploding
I’m not a supernova, I’m a super Nova Scotian
You’re never gonna grow up
According to my zodiac there ain’t a situation that I won’t adapt
Hold me back, I’m goin' in I’m just too clever and too blunt
Coming alive between November 22 and December 21, we here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Madchild]
I’mma lead with Scorpio, sellin’ out the Orpheum
Stop taking them opiates, hold them pills like Morpheus
Everything I say and do is probably not appropriate
Used to get in trouble cause I had the wrong associates
I’m a little monster you could read my horoscope
Life is kinda hard to figure out like it was Morse code
Libra but I’m balanced, I’m a small demented phantom
Also, half of Scorpio I’ve got this temper tantrum
I remember back when I was handsome
Young and famous rich, but now I’m bucking Charlie Manson
I would keep advancing yes I’ll make it probably in time
Because I got this crazy drive from my astrology signs
I’m a little goblin policy is no apologies
People watch me fall asleep but now I kill it lawlessly
It’s absolute my vanity, maximum insanity
I’m masculine and actually back to breathing anarchy

[Hook]INTRO [Kardinal Offishall]
Yeah
Turn my headphones up
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, feeling kind of sick though
Yeah, now I'mma kick this
Uh huh, uh huh uh huh
DJs, cut this back to back
Word, Circle
Silver House And the Girl, Figure IV
Head nod, yeah y'all know

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo that kid nice
Where he from though? T-dot (ohhh)
Where the ice at? Oh I see underground emcee
Nah, but he nice though
He flip that shit twice though, he sounding like (who?)
Nah, it a must that he bust you (fo' real)
He be eating that mic though
Ever see the way he flows and tears down the show
(Fo' real), he clever
Never sever the Ever from fresh when he spits, everything's a hit
He got skills like Mad and the Superfriends
When he does a duo, it comes out like a crew track, he's so wicked
Cooler than Ice Cube, Mack more than 10 at one time
Like Choclair he's a Virgin to the wack rhyme
It's true (fo' real)
Got a Blueprint like Thrust, said he's notorious
And watch the hit bust all over the country (fo' real)
Even on BET, ask Tigga about them niggas with that Northern Touch beat they was playing
No playing, that nigga with the afro
That's right, tight and rocks crowds all night (word)
Style like no other tall brother on your FM dial
My nigga kip-ki-kip-ki-Kardinal
You know

CHORUS [little girl singing]
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way

[Kardinal Offishall]
Check it
A dis ain't a dis if a dis has discrepancies
I dismiss your dissidences and doubt your intelligence
And discuss how disjoint your disc
From the dispatch, a distance throw all y'all from shit that's wack
Steady disguising your disfavour, disliking my steelo
Dis ain't kindergarten, you don't have to go where we go
Discipline yourself before your ego disappears
While I discretely disassemble you from your career
Stupid! Dis is not your ordinary rapper dis
Dis so all you niggas discover just who the dapper is
Causing discomfort, disallowing your dis-jock to rock
Any record cause your whole sound's flop, yo
Dis is going out to niggas who dis without
Thinking about what the hell they doing, yo your shit we're booing
Oh... while I discombobulate you
This is going out to any nigga opposing my crew
Like that
Yo, Silver House And the Girl 2000
Kardinal Offishall, in your ear side, nawmean
