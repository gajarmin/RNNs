I used to sit on your shoulders
Felt like i had a view with a whole globe right below us
I was young but still old enough to know
That my daddy was'nt rich but you had a heart of gold
These childhood memories are priceless
Far from perfect , you know how life gets
When did it all start to go downhill
When i realise that this passion i had found is real
You claim it was the worst decision i could ever make
To not chase it was a risk i could never take
Safe to say as i got closer to my dreams
The bond between us was just tearing at the seams
And so it seems the war is finally over
I'm older , but still that little boy thats on your shoulders
Loving me is all you've ever done
All i hear now with the words of a father to a son

(chorus)

Run a little faster
Stand a little taller
I'll be there for you
Like a rock in a middle of a raging river

Fight a little harder
Fly a little higher
I'll be there for you
Like a rock in a middle of a raging river

Sometimes you sit up my shoulders
And its a perfect view , with a whole globe right below us
So much to say yea words can't truly describe
How i felt inside the second that you arrived
A little bit of fear a whole lot of joy
It still hasn't sunk in, man i got a boy!!
Can't even lie , im concerned in every way
I guess all i could do is learn everyday
To me and mommy you're our number 1
I often wonder what type of man you will become
You'll do great things , and that im confident
Always stay humble or miss the compliments
As for the ladies , save for the wedding ring
Always put god above everything
As long as im alive my job is never done
These are just the words of a father to a son

(chorus)

Maybe ya listening and ya contemplating
Cos its been awhile since yall had a conversation
A simple call, time to man up
Before you hit that last digit, quick to hang up
Feels like there's no way it can be done
Picking up the phone and it weights about a ton
But , still not as heavy as your heart
Tryna make amends not sure when you should start
Even if you talk , what do you say , thats a scary thought
Dont let pride get in the way , what a shame
Shared the last name yet you're strangers
No pain remains forever love can change it ( changes )
Need someone to lift you up when you fall down
Seperated , hesitate to tear the walls down
Forgiveness can heal when its all said and done
That goes for both a father and a son

(chorus)

So steady as we go
Yes there's always room to grow
Our love will be a rock in the middle of a raging river

Who could blame you
I've made it so complicated
If I could change you
Cause working it out is overrated

Why are you so blind to see that
Truth and love
They could overcome

VERSE (MC Jin)
Where should I start
No fiction, these are all facts
Let’s take it back to when we first cross paths
I was 13 you was 20 something
Deep in the game
Me...I didn't know nothing!
Took me under your wings, just a kid
No wonder why I worshipped everything you did
Pops said you was bad news
That's cool
Parents just don’t understand
Sad but that’s true
It’s like I didn’t have a choice
Cause without you, I wouldn’t have a voice
You literally put the mic in my hand
Got on my grind overtime
We formulated a plan
World domination, that was the goal
2 decades later watch the story unfold
Now it feels like we’ve finally made it
But when did our relationship become so complicated

They say you've changed you ain't the same
Now you're all about the money, ain’t that a shame?
That’s just the half of it
All these accusations are they accurate?
Skip substance, you said just put some swag in it
Never knew what you would do to us
If you've changed, I guess that makes two of us
Grew up as a misguided youth
All you fed me were lies disguised as the truth
Views so distorted, now I see it all clearly
On two different paths, still I love you so dearly
Uh huh
Our past is undeniable
At one point I was ready to die for you
Mixed emotions running through my head
Couldn’t even sleep when they said that you were dead
False alarm, reports exaggerated
I'm glad you made it through but man it’s complicated

VERSE (Hollis)
Last few years of my life I’ve thought about
What I’m taking and what I’m giving
Searching through all the pieces of myself
It all happened in 15 minutes
I took some time and I’m not sure about
What you’re thinking and what you’re saying
All I’m trying to do is be myself
Figure it out, it’s complicated
It’s complicated
It’s complicated

Why are you so blind to see?[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh

[Verse 1]
I been doin this for so long started out with just
A dream
Something told me
Hold on
We gon make
It to the top
Felt the world
Was sleepin on me
But I never stopped now they wakin’ up to smell the coffee
And it cost me
Whole lotta
Blood sweat and tears just tellin
My own story
I call it the
Wonder years
Now I got it figured out and its never been
The same
Uh uh
Bring on the money and the fame
That ain’t my motivation nah I’m quite the simple guy
But if I said
I didn’t care about it that would be a lie
Maybe I don’t fit in
Who am I kiddin
Been waitin
My whole life
Just to get in

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me
Your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute look how far I came
From watching on the sidelines
I’m finally in the game
Now the pressures on but how can I complain
Ain’t this what I wanted tell me
Are you entertained
Cause when I had the crown you were
Claiming that you love me turn around
And put me down
Now you
Thinking nothing of me okay thats cool
God bless you
Amen
I rather have genuine haters
Than a bunch of fake friends
So pardon me
If I choose not to be around ya’ll
Just when things are looking up
You hoping for my downfall
15 minutes
And it’s going by quick
I know you counting down the seconds like (tick tick tick)

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere

[Teesa's Verse]
Yeah you
Do what it takes for the fame
To rush up to you but the clock ticks away
And the game is left up to you yeah you
Do what it takes for the fame
To rush up to you but the clock ticks away
And the game is left up to you

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere welcome to the club and I ain’t goin nowhere I know you see me
And I ain’t goin nowhereHe just turned eighteen, high school senior, book smart
Dreamed of the NFL, captain of the football team
Prom king, mom proud, college bound
Like look at my baby he's a scholar now
While the homies were sitting faded
He concentrated, kept his nose inside the books
And now he finally made it
Celebrate it with the fam
He the first to be overcoming obstacles and adversity
So many dark days and cold cold nights (cold nights)
But the future's looking all so bright
That's why it doesn't seem quite fair
In a split second dreams turned into a nightmare
He was gone by the time paramedics arrived
Ironically the drunk driver survived
At the funeral his mom just cried and cried
Couldn't help but keep wondering why
Then she heard the angel sing..

(Chorus)

Faith is forever, so right now
Lets just go to where we lead the world (lead the world)x3
So father, bring us home we will never know
(we will never know)x3
[To heaven's ceiling, we take this life and bring it home with me(?)]x2


She's a mother of three
Two boys, one girl and a husband indeed
Feeling blessed way beyond words can describe
Stay at home mom and she wears it with pride
Girl scout meetings and soccer practice
Grocery shopping and filing taxes
And a missed of all list its still dinner at 6
A picture perfect life, you thought it didn't exist
He's real, we searching for answers
Time stood still when she heard the words Cervical cancer
And the fear's below
Doctor says she has six months that was 3 years ago
Now the whole family's gathered at the side of her bed
Only sound of silence that's aside of her head
Tears rolling down the cheek she's beginning to pray
Closed her eyes and started drifting away
It will be okay..

(Chorus)

I'm tryna be faithful
For every second i'm grateful that we had together
Forever and ever i will treasure but why do they have to take you
Still can't let you go, just to let you know
Everytime i close my eyes, i see your face god bless your soul


*Vanlalruata Chhakchhuak[Verse 1]
I know our time is precious
So I’m hoping this’ll last
I keep runnin’ towards my future
Can’t focus on the past
But this reminds me
Of the first rhyme I ever wrote for you
Here’s what I hope to do
Make every line a quotable
Thats just me
Being overly ambitious
I do this for the people
Not the bloggers or the critics
Wait could it be
Maybe I’m just in denial
Been cravin’ for attention
Ever since I was a child
Is it really a surprise
I feed off of your adoration
When I step on stage
I’m just seekin’ validation
This type of transparency is
Quite new to me
Never felt free enough to
Speak truthfully
Learnin’ how to live
And I’m no longer
Stressin’ fam
Life is a teacher
But don’t expect no lesson plans
This is for the
Dreamers the thinkers
The believers
The lost and confused
The followers
The leaders
Yeah

[Verse 2]
They say you only get one shot
To make a first impression
Thats why I’m twice as grateful
When I think of all my blessings
Great company
Great minds
Great times
Wouldn’t trade it for the world
If you need it take mines
See the big picture
I’m just here to play my part
You are now watching history unfoldin’
In the arche
Many have tried
Many have failed
Full steam ahead
Only to see their dream derailed
As for me
Ain’t no telling if that ship has sailed
I’m alive and well
The details of my
Of my tale
There’s joy
And there’s pain
Victory and defeat
What I lost
What I gained
The bitter with the sweet
Feel free to stay a while
Take a tour inside my mind
Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to XIV:LIX
Feel free to stay a while
Take a tour inside my mind
And I present to you
XIV:LIX[Verse 1]
My peoples keep their head up
In the truest display
Do what they gotta do
Just to get through the day
Back in Hong Kong
Where they grew up and stayed
Until they immigrated to the US of A
Chasin’ the American Dream
A ruff ryde for my pops
Guess what
He still shut em down
Open up shop
In the back of the kitchen
Makin’ wontons
Late nights out with my moms
Playin’ mahjong
See I was a young’n
But the culture was inside of me
Playin’ cards Big 2
Never want the diamond three
Every Sunday
It was part of the tradition
While y’all was at church
Dimsum was our religion
I’m on a quest for love
That’s just part of my pursuits
No matter where I go
I’m always stickin’ to my roots
Show you my world
That’s all I’m tryin’ to do here
Cause for me
Everyday is Chinese New Year

[Chorus]
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But I ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday is Chinese New Year
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But we ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday everyday

[Verse 2]
While we on the topic
I got something to reveal
Can I be real though
I mean really real
Cause at one point
Yo I was losin’ sleep
Thinkin’ bout the first song
That I ever released
Lookin’ back it was a
Lesson in my eyes
And if you never heard of it
Hey that’s just
A blessin’ in disguise
Learn Chinese dropped
Things never been the same
Credibility gone
Charge it to the game
Truly though seemed like a
Scene straight outta movie
I was in the studio
With 1/3 of The Fugees
It’d be a understatement
To say I was excited
So when Clef said that’s it
I ain’t hesitate to write it
I was barely 21
But that’s not an excuse
I got on my own two feet
And walked into that booth
To make y’all proud
That’s all I’m tryin’ to do here
Cause for me
Everyday is Chinese New Year

[Chorus]
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But I ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday is Chinese New Year
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But we ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday everyday

[Verse 3]
Roll out the red carpet
Guess we’ve finally arrived
0% luck
100% drive
For your safety
I went through the crash test
Life is a road trip
Can’t rely on MapQuest
This is for my sisters
And my brothers strugglin’
Here’s hopin’ that
You can find comfort in your skin
Not better not worse
We just equally blessed
They say we fresh off the boat
Yeah the key word is fresh
Walk a mile in my shoes
Feel the pressure produced
When you’re mentioned
In the same sentence as Bruce
Leeway none given
Hard to fill a tall order
Almost drowned in the hype
Now I’m just tryin’ to be water
Chinese or not
This is for whoever will listen
Listen we are more similar
Than different
Unite us all
That’s what I’m tryin’ to do here
Cause for us
Everyday is Chinese New Year

[Chorus]
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But I ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday is Chinese New Year
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But we ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday everyday[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for

[Verse 1]
I still remember those nights just layin’ in bed
Hands behind my head starin’ at the ceilin’
Wide awake dreamin’
Just to make sure
I’m alive not dead
Eyes bloodshot red
All I ever wanted was to change my life with this pen
It was bound to happen
Felt it in the pit of my stomach I just ain’t know when
So I kept on pushin’ kept on climbin’
It’s not like I had options
I was crushed
I was let down
But I’ve come too far to think about stoppin’
These opportunities might just ruin me
Maybe my time has come and gone
No point in dwellin’ on what’s be- yond my control
I got no choice but to carry on

[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for

[Verse 2]
Seems like a nice life right
Center stage well take a peek at what’s behind the curtains
Cause when the bright lights burn out it turns out
Blessings are burdens
I ain’t complainin’
I’m just sayin’ can I vent some of my frustrations
Being Christian
Being Asian
Trying to live up to your expectations
I mean it’s one thing to think you know me
Give me space though you dont own me
Why is it always
In the most crowded places I feel the most lonely
The load is heavy
My shoulders ready
In my weakness He is strong
I close my eyes and pray see the cross was carried so I gotta carry on

[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for
Before you run gotta walk before you walk gotta crawl
Carry on
Carry on
Before you fly gotta fall before you fly gotta fall
Carry on
Carry on
Before you run gotta walk before you walk gotta crawl
Carry on
Carry on
Before you fly gotta fall before you fly gotta fall
Carry on
Carry on[Verse 1]

Why are you so blind to see?(verse 1 )

Can you believe it , a whole decade has gone by
Since i dropped my first album , man time flies
Where does it go, nobody knows
I appreciate you all , for coming to the shows
Just to get front row , so that i can see your sign
Showing up hours early , didn't even mind
Cos when i hit the stage , nothing else matter
We were on cloud 9 , till my dreams got shattered
Felt like the spotlight , faded overnight
I can only blame myself , cos i fell into the hype
Couldn't admit it hurt , the game was so intense
They threw dirt on my name , but you came to my defense
Some abandoned ship , but you stuck around
Even supported the projects i put out underground
As far as my career is like i crash to survive
All these years it was you that kept my passion alive

(chorus)

You're more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family

They talk about it like it was just yesterday
Overwhelmed by the love that they sent my way
You know what blows my mind when they say
Jin i remember i was in the 7th grade
I used to watch you every week i was so amazed
Up there to compete , man it felt like i was on that stage
And when you got signed i got signed too
Yea thats why i'll always stand behind you
See that was something i was not prepared for
Still figuring things out for myself therefore
All the songs about getting drunk or smokin up
Never cross my mind the messages you were soakin up
Didn't realise where i was till i was in it
Truth is , i was never mean to begin with
Hopefully we'll be face to face someday
And we'll both see how we have come such a long way

(chorus)

You're more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family

(verse 2)

Lets connect , thats exactly why i came
Showing love , wanna hug , take a picture
Sign my name , sure thing , as long as i ain't in a hurry
Can always re-take it if the picture looks blurry
Hand shakin , hey no need to be nervous
Take a deep breath , none of us are perfect
I know you might have expectations
But i'm just a man , not to be idolized
I hope you understand..
So feel free to take me off that pedestal
I'd rather see you eye to eye , now there's a better view
We have lots in common , and all the vid is real
Share the same emotions , till life can make you feel
Your support is unconditional , they dont understand it
Between me and you , i will not take it for granted
Reach out anytime , send an email ..
No offence though ..  thats my  g'mail(

Chorus)

You're more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family

#Kenosis Ralte[Intro: Jin]
This from the heart
Yeah
This is from the heart right here
Yeah
Everybody has a story to tell
Check this out though

[Verse 1: Jin]
I knew this Chinese dude in junior high
Part of my crew, everybody knew this kid
He was the talk of the school
Intelligent and well-spoken respected by teachers
All the other students kept they eyes on his sneakers
What can I say
You can tell if he's cool if you talk with him
During fire drills girls would want to walk with him
He could have any chick up in his deal
But there was only one girl he wanted to call boos
See it's all true, found himself stressed in a dead end
The girl he was feelin' was obsessed with his best friend
His best friend's a player, that's the reason he's pissed
Plus he treat her, like she don't even exist
He ain't tryin' to hate on his man
But there was no help in it
Wrote the girl a letter told her how He felt in it
She was, shocked at first
For him revealing the truth
Until she realized that she was feeling approved

[Hook: Aja Smith]
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
And you've been thinkin' of me ohh..

[Verse 2: Jin]
Uhh..
Yeah so as you know as time goes by
Things get a little more serious..phht
Just listen
It was strictly hip-hop
Now they bump the slow jams all day
Went from holding hands to making out
In the hallway
Their relationship seemed like a dream come true
As time went by, their friendship grew
Staring at the stars, trading secrets on the phone
When her parents were at work she would sneak him in the home
He told her he was a virgin the day that they met
So on his birthday he got a gift he'll never forget (heh)
Females were jealous but they still callin' him cute
First day in summer school they rocked the matching Nautica suits
Happy in each other's arms
Can it be they found true love livin' in a fantasy
Then reality attacks
His pops couldn't see past the fact
His son was Asian but his girlfriend was black
Imagine having to choose between the one you love for your 'fam'
That's like cutting off your right or left hand (damn)

[Hook: Aja Smith]
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
And you've been thinkin' of me ohh..

[Verse 3: Jin]
Uh uh yeah uh
I know this sounds like a true story
Could have happened to any one of us
It's crazy though right
Check it
Now if this sounds like a true story
That's probably cause' it is
And I know for a fact cause' I am that Chinese kid (hmm)
Looking back now, I know it's more then just a crush
I'm saying the whole experience taught me so much
Love can overcome anything that gets in its way
That's the reason I still think of shawty till this day
We talk now and then
She's doing her thing
We both all grown up
I think she's rockin' a ring
I know she's, proud of me and all the things I've accomplished
She was there when I was nobody that's being honest
Ain't no shame I'll admit it
She was there when I cried
So in return I'll wipe the tears from her eyes
As far as my pops, he's a little more open-minded
If his son is happy he's a hundred percent behind it
Now this is a song I knew I had to do
Because all the stuff I went through might have happened to you

[Hook: Aja Smith]
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
Oh..I've been (I've been) thinking of you
And you've been thinkin' of me ohh..

[Outro: Jin]
Uhhh..
Yeah
Everybody remembers they first love
You only get one
So you gotta remember (yea uhh)
Just wanted you to know Jin's still thinking about you
I know you've been thinking about me too. (yeah)[Verse 1]
They say that it’s the root of evil
I guess thats kinda true
Just to get it
Look at all the things that people do
Rob steal kill cheat lie
Sell their soul
In the blink of an eye
Just to see their dollars grow
I don’t know
What about the hard working nine to fivers
Trying to make a honest living day to day
Barely survivin’
Bus drivin’
Kitchen cookin’
Cleanin’
Takin out the trash
Feelin like there
Ain’t no meanin’
But to try and get some cash go to school
Higher learnin’
That’s what they say you need in this society
We all tryin’ to succeed
What does success
Look like
How do you measure
The amount
I mean
Is it solely based on
The balance of your account if thats the case
I’m tryin to break the bank
I see you sittin on dubs what’s up with
That empty tank
To be frank
That’s just not healthy
You trying to get rich
Man I’m tryin to be wealthy

[Chorus]
If it don’t make dollars
Then it don’t make sense
All the paper in the world
And you’ll never be content
Whether falling from the skies or growing on the trees
You serve it like a master got you falling on your knees
Love it, Money
Stack it, Money
Count it, Money
Fold it, Money
Spend it, Money
Want it, Money
Need it, Money
Take it, Money

[Verse 2]
It can change your life in a major way
How much did you make today
What about after taxes
What you got saved away
Let you hold somethin’
I thought you just got paid
How you rather be broke
Just to copp some Js
Who am I to criticize
I’ve been down that same path
Spend it faster
Than I make it
No hesitatin’
I paid cash
That was my goal in life
To have the freshest sneakers
But as as I get older
Things get much deeper
Who’s the richest
Not my business
Never check the forbes list
All they ever do
Is tell me you cannot afford this
Money ain’t a thing
Thats the motto
When you ballin’
Money’s everything
When the bill collectors calling
In the end though
It’s not like
You can die with it
Not to mention
All the things that you can’t buy with it
Love peace joy good health these are priceless
Never sell yourself short no matter what the price is

[Chorus]
If it don’t make dollars
Then it don’t make sense
All the paper in the world
And you’ll never be content whether falling from the skies or growing on the trees
You serve it like a master got you falling on your knees Love it, Money
Stack it, Money
Count it, Money
Fold it, Money
Spend it, Money
Want it, Money
Need it, Money
Take it, Money[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for

[Verse 1]
I still remember those nights just layin’ in bed
Hands behind my head starin’ at the ceilin’
Wide awake dreamin’
Just to make sure
I’m alive not dead
Eyes bloodshot red
All I ever wanted was to change my life with this pen
It was bound to happen
Felt it in the pit of my stomach I just ain’t know when
So I kept on pushin’ kept on climbin’
It’s not like I had options
I was crushed
I was let down
But I’ve come too far to think about stoppin’
These opportunities might just ruin me
Maybe my time has come and gone
No point in dwellin’ on what’s be- yond my control
I got no choice but to carry on

[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for

[Verse 2]
Seems like a nice life right
Center stage well take a peek at what’s behind the curtains
Cause when the bright lights burn out it turns out
Blessings are burdens
I ain’t complainin’
I’m just sayin’ can I vent some of my frustrations
Being Christian
Being Asian
Trying to live up to your expectations
I mean it’s one thing to think you know me
Give me space though you dont own me
Why is it always
In the most crowded places I feel the most lonely
The load is heavy
My shoulders ready
In my weakness He is strong
I close my eyes and pray see the cross was carried so I gotta carry on

[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for
Before you run gotta walk before you walk gotta crawl
Carry on
Carry on
Before you fly gotta fall before you fly gotta fall
Carry on
Carry on
Before you run gotta walk before you walk gotta crawl
Carry on
Carry on
Before you fly gotta fall before you fly gotta fall
Carry on
Carry on[Verse 1]
I’d like to take this moment
To tell y’all how I came up
But first let me tell y’all
Where I came from
In North Miami Beach
Born and raised
On the grind is
How I spent most of my days
Chillin’ out
Maxin’ relaxin’ coolin’
Kickin’ freestyles
Outside of my school and
Before LL was in the house
I picked up the mic
Mama almost knocked me out
Not a new jack
You ain’t get the memo wait
98 I was on my third demotape
No YouTube views
No Instagram
Had to hit that stage to
Convince the fans
Won’t lie got booed
Maybe once or twice
Never again
I must’ve been doin’
Somethin’ right
Could it be my desire
Hunger Games
I’m a one of one
You will find none the same
With skills required like you have never seen
I got that fire
Katniss Everdeen
To get signed
Show up in headlines
Labels slept for awhile
Bedtime
Til I hit ‘em with that
Wake up call
911 emergency
Wake up y’all
Plan A don’t stop tip they know my name
Plan B was simple
See Plan A
Gotta stay focused
To overcome what’s tough
That’s just how it is when you’re comin’ up

[Chorus]
I know you see me
Comin’ up
I know you see me
Comin’ up
That’s what’s up

[Verse 2]
I’m a father now
I love story time
Ready for it?
Here’s a Toy Story line
They say where you been Jin
I been right here
Just buildin’ up my buzz for a light year
Startin’ from scratch
Somethin’ fresh indeed
Cookin’ up tracks
Got a new recipe
A little bit of this and a little of that
Let it sit in the booth for 30 minutes
And it’s a wrap
The delivery is flawless
When I spit it that’s a fact
If it isn’t permission granted feel free to send it back
Shout out to Twista
A vet fasho
We did a song together and never met before
Sometimes that’s just
How the game goes
No pot of gold
At the end of rainbows
Pockets not quite
At the proper calorie yet
My biggest payout
Cashing a reality check
But the last thing I’m doin’ though
Is prayin’ for wealth
Cause I love the Lord way before anything else
In the meantime yo
I got business to do
‘bout to kill it
All that’s left is my finishin’ move
Stayin’ composed
While I’m still in control
Tryin’ to sellout these shows
Without sellin’ my soul
I seen the highs and the lows
Just to sum it up
That’s always how it is
When you’re comin’ up

[Chorus]
I know you see me
Comin’ up
I know you see me
Comin’ up
That’s what’s up

[Ending]
Ahh yeaah
Here’s the best part
The come up
Gotta enjoy it
Check me out yo
I’m comin’ up
Nah I ain’t lookin’ down
I’m comin’ up
Nah I ain’t lookin’ down
At this rate
I won’t even see the ground
At this rate
I won’t even see the ground
Change the game
Thats what I came to do
Change the game
That’s what I came to do
Change the game
Don’t let it change you
Change the game
Don’t let it change
Change, change
You, you, you[MC Jin]

Yo...

They want the punch line, battle raps,
I mean I had the title, you can have it back.

That line was said so egotistically,
I never gave it back, it got stripped from me.

Truly a blessing, what it did to me,
learn more lessons from defeat, then victory.

Like how to take a loss, humility,
what happened next though, the rest is history.

Glad they stopped me, it was going to my head,
Instead, I'm declaring that the cocky Jin is dead.

Don't put to much weight, on reputation and face,
expect to get let down, when expectations are great.

They use to accuse me, of relying on my race,
what they gone say now, I'm relying on my faith?

See that's fine with me, I was designed to be,
I kill my old self, who wants to die with me?


[HOOK]
I know it don't make sense, due to recent events,
I ain't been the same since, I know you must be convinced.

I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin.

I'M SO ALIVE (STILL A DEAD MAN WALKING)


[MC Jin]

Yo...

They want the party, getting money reps,
I had fun with that, but I'm done with that.

See I ain't opposed, to having a good time,
but what I compose now, are more then just good lines.

I use to dream, of getting five mics,
now every sixteen, I'm praying that you find Christ.

For the cheese, on the dotting line... I would've signed twice,
that's what I get, for following three blind mice...

Desperation, it was going to my head,
instead, I declare that paper chasing Jin is dead.

Seeking riches, I let it measure what I'm worth,
wasting time.. storing up, treasures here on earth.

Only to be destroyed, I can't fake the image,
so I'm prepared to see my fan base diminished.

See that's fine with me, I was designed to be,
I killed my old self, who wants to die with me?

[HOOK]
I know it don't make sense, due to recent events,
I ain't been the same since, I know you must be convinced.

I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin.

I'M SO ALIVE (STILL A DEAD MAN WALKING)


[Toestah]

Five years ago, I met Jin for the first time,
we crossed paths, like church signs.

I was plotting on my bible,
suddenly, I'm shaking hands with my idol.

Three years later, me and Jin cooking tracks up in the stew,
cooking up tracks, boy it feel good.

Shot the video in Hong Kong, plus we did a show,
that's why I call him big bro...

I'm a dead man, dead man,
tryna to get ahead man.

Learning my ways,
I was listening to redman,

Back then, all I cared
was pouring up the remy.

Nowadays, I'm rapping with a purpose,
tryna make ends meet.

I don't know why, but sometimes feel empty,
I waiting at the gates, for entry.

Want to give it up,
but my luck won't let me.

I'm out with the old me,
so God don't tempt me.

(Yeah)

[END HOOK]
I know it don't make sense, due to recent events,
I ain't been the same since, I know you must be convinced.

I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin.

I'M SO ALIVE (STILL A DEAD MAN WALKING)

I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin.
I put the old me in a coffin.


I'M SO ALIVE (STILL A DEAD MAN WALKING.....)[Intro]
Somebody tell me why somebody tell me why
It feels like that we’re here to just eat, sleep, and die

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin’
The first thing to cross my mind asked myself this question
What am I doing with my time
On the grind
Grindin’ for what
A purpose I don’t even know
I just get up and go
Hope for the best
Is it a test?
Maybe so
So who got the answers
Not me but I’m searchin
And I’m certain every person that is workin’
Has a version
Of the truth
But what’s the use
Without no proof
We just arguin’ to argue nah I’d rather hit the booth
And let loose
Making use of these skills
Everyday is real
Just trying to pay these bills
Is that all there is
Or is it something bigger
Than taking care of yo business and counting all your figures
Questions keep on comin’ can’t just keep on runnin’
Gotta face the music
I do this and I love it
I was put here for a reason
I’m just trying to figure out why I know one thing
I ain’t here to just
Eat sleep and die

[Chorus]
I know it’s just a lie
I know it’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here to just eat, sleep, and die
I know it’s just a lie
I know it’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here to just eat, sleep, and die

[Verse 2]
You tell yourself
That they don’t know
What’s your plans
And what’s your goals
All that hate
Can take it’s toll
What will it take to
Save your soul
Trying to find some meaning
So you keep on dreaming
Which turn to nightmares they don’t fight fair
Still slay your demons
Screamin’ for freedom gotta keep fighting
‘til your destiny is fulfilled
Let your guard down on the battlefield
With a shattered shield might get yourself killed
I know what you’re thinkin’
You’re the captain of your own ship
So even if it starts sinkin’
No matter what happens don’t trip
Don’t take more than you give
What are you leavin’ your kids?
Cause even when you’re gone
Your legacy will still live
That’s called making an impact
In fact let it be known
That when it’s your time to go
You can’t take anything that you own
That goes for all of us
Universal law
The damage has been done
We can’t reverse the fall
You were put here for a reason
Trust me that’s no lie I’m sayin’ though
It can’t be to just eat, sleep, and die

[Ending]
Somebody tell me why
Somebody tell me why
It feels like that we’re here to just eat sleep and die
Somebody tell me why
Somebody tell me why
It feels like that we’re here
To just eat sleep and die
I know that’s just a lie
I know that’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here to just eat, sleep, and die I know that’s just a lie
I know that’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here to just eat, sleep, and die[Chorus]
Fairty tales are dust but I
I believe in us
Fairty tales are dust but I
I believe in us

[Verse 1]
Yo, picture me 23
Whole life in front of me
Have you seen
How to be a player
Bill Belamy
That was me
Just kiddin’
Maybe not
To the same extreme
Naw
Had a few ladies on the team we first met in PR
It was cool
Can’t say we saw sparks fly second chance in NY
Killed my set
Got off the stage
A superstar in the flesh
Her demeanor though
Far from impressed
Now usually
My game is on point
When I’m in action
Can’t lie
Her lack of interest
Was quite attractive obviously she was not a fan
As the convo continued
Our fairy tale began

[Chorus]
Fairy tales are dust but I
I believe in us
Fairy tales are dust but I
I believe in us
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us

[Verse 2]
I’m so traditional
First date
Unforgettable
Two adults
Watchin’ The Incredibles
Every weekend it was movie and a dinner
If it ain’t broke
Don’t fix it
Knew I had a winner
When it came to my career
She always had my back
Never abandoned ship she was Rose I was Jack
When the call came from Hong Kong
We were unprepared
Rackin’ up miles like Clooney things were up in the air
We were literally on opposite sides of the earth
While she was puttin’ on her PJs
I was gettin up for work
Somehow we made it work
But not with ease
She turned a boy into a man and so I got on bended knees

[Chorus]
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe in us fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe in us fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us

[Verse 3]
We tied the knot just a few years ago
Where?
In Puerto Rico
Hooo!
Beachside
Kept it low-key
Maybe you ain’t get the news
Time flies
Chance just entered his terrific twos
I’m married with children
A feelin’ I can’t explain
I guess it’s like scoring four touchdowns in one game
Things ain’t perfect
We fight and fuss like every couple does
But I’m glad I have a partner
When it’s time to knuckle up
From the heart she’s more than just my wife
She’s my best friend my worst critic
When it’s dark she’s my source of light
And everyday is the start of a new chapter
As they lived happily ever after
Yeah

[Chorus]
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe in us fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe in us fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in usHe just turned eighteen, high school senior, book smart
Dreamed of the NFL, captain of the football team
Prom king, mom proud, college bound
Like look at my baby he's a scholar now
While the homies were sitting faded
He concentrated, kept his nose inside the books
And now he finally made it
Celebrate it with the fam
He the first to be overcoming obstacles and adversity
So many dark days and cold cold nights (cold nights)
But the future's looking all so bright
That's why it doesn't seem quite fair
In a split second dreams turned into a nightmare
He was gone by the time paramedics arrived
Ironically the drunk driver survived
At the funeral his mom just cried and cried
Couldn't help but keep wondering why
Then she heard the angel sing..

(Chorus)

Faith is forever, so right now
Lets just go to where we lead the world (lead the world)x3
So father, bring us home we will never know
(we will never know)x3
[To heaven's ceiling, we take this life and bring it home with me(?)]x2


She's a mother of three
Two boys, one girl and a husband indeed
Feeling blessed way beyond words can describe
Stay at home mom and she wears it with pride
Girl scout meetings and soccer practice
Grocery shopping and filing taxes
And a missed of all list its still dinner at 6
A picture perfect life, you thought it didn't exist
He's real, we searching for answers
Time stood still when she heard the words Cervical cancer
And the fear's below
Doctor says she has six months that was 3 years ago
Now the whole family's gathered at the side of her bed
Only sound of silence that's aside of her head
Tears rolling down the cheek she's beginning to pray
Closed her eyes and started drifting away
It will be okay..

(Chorus)

I'm tryna be faithful
For every second i'm grateful that we had together
Forever and ever i will treasure but why do they have to take you
Still can't let you go, just to let you know
Everytime i close my eyes, i see your face god bless your soul


*Vanlalruata Chhakchhuak[Verse 1]
I know our time is precious
So I’m hoping this’ll last
I keep runnin’ towards my future
Can’t focus on the past
But this reminds me
Of the first rhyme I ever wrote for you
Here’s what I hope to do
Make every line a quotable
Thats just me
Being overly ambitious
I do this for the people
Not the bloggers or the critics
Wait could it be
Maybe I’m just in denial
Been cravin’ for attention
Ever since I was a child
Is it really a surprise
I feed off of your adoration
When I step on stage
I’m just seekin’ validation
This type of transparency is
Quite new to me
Never felt free enough to
Speak truthfully
Learnin’ how to live
And I’m no longer
Stressin’ fam
Life is a teacher
But don’t expect no lesson plans
This is for the
Dreamers the thinkers
The believers
The lost and confused
The followers
The leaders
Yeah

[Verse 2]
They say you only get one shot
To make a first impression
Thats why I’m twice as grateful
When I think of all my blessings
Great company
Great minds
Great times
Wouldn’t trade it for the world
If you need it take mines
See the big picture
I’m just here to play my part
You are now watching history unfoldin’
In the arche
Many have tried
Many have failed
Full steam ahead
Only to see their dream derailed
As for me
Ain’t no telling if that ship has sailed
I’m alive and well
The details of my
Of my tale
There’s joy
And there’s pain
Victory and defeat
What I lost
What I gained
The bitter with the sweet
Feel free to stay a while
Take a tour inside my mind
Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to XIV:LIX
Feel free to stay a while
Take a tour inside my mind
And I present to you
XIV:LIXI used to sit on your shoulders
Felt like i had a view with a whole globe right below us
I was young but still old enough to know
That my daddy was'nt rich but you had a heart of gold
These childhood memories are priceless
Far from perfect , you know how life gets
When did it all start to go downhill
When i realise that this passion i had found is real
You claim it was the worst decision i could ever make
To not chase it was a risk i could never take
Safe to say as i got closer to my dreams
The bond between us was just tearing at the seams
And so it seems the war is finally over
I'm older , but still that little boy thats on your shoulders
Loving me is all you've ever done
All i hear now with the words of a father to a son

(chorus)

Run a little faster
Stand a little taller
I'll be there for you
Like a rock in a middle of a raging river

Fight a little harder
Fly a little higher
I'll be there for you
Like a rock in a middle of a raging river

Sometimes you sit up my shoulders
And its a perfect view , with a whole globe right below us
So much to say yea words can't truly describe
How i felt inside the second that you arrived
A little bit of fear a whole lot of joy
It still hasn't sunk in, man i got a boy!!
Can't even lie , im concerned in every way
I guess all i could do is learn everyday
To me and mommy you're our number 1
I often wonder what type of man you will become
You'll do great things , and that im confident
Always stay humble or miss the compliments
As for the ladies , save for the wedding ring
Always put god above everything
As long as im alive my job is never done
These are just the words of a father to a son

(chorus)

Maybe ya listening and ya contemplating
Cos its been awhile since yall had a conversation
A simple call, time to man up
Before you hit that last digit, quick to hang up
Feels like there's no way it can be done
Picking up the phone and it weights about a ton
But , still not as heavy as your heart
Tryna make amends not sure when you should start
Even if you talk , what do you say , thats a scary thought
Dont let pride get in the way , what a shame
Shared the last name yet you're strangers
No pain remains forever love can change it ( changes )
Need someone to lift you up when you fall down
Seperated , hesitate to tear the walls down
Forgiveness can heal when its all said and done
That goes for both a father and a son

(chorus)

So steady as we go
Yes there's always room to grow
Our love will be a rock in the middle of a raging river

#KenosisRalte[Intro]
What if, you knew then what you know now?
Or what if you know now, what you wish you knew then?
That's what I ask you
Lets go

[Verse 1: Jin]
A wise man once told me life is what you make it
Bare witness to the lies simply cause' the truth is naked
My thoughts are sacred yet I share em' with the masses
I intend to be around when the barrier collapses
It's dust to dust and ashes to ashes
Those that come up quick tend to be falling the fastest
On the cash-route, but for the paper they get lost
Not I, I rather let nature take it's course
The reality is harsh but it's gotta be accepted
Your fate has been determined, outcome is pre-selected
No telling when your breath's stoppin', and death's knockin
To enjoy every second is your best option
Treat every first time like if it's your last
I wish I could somehow go and revisit the past
Correct any mistakes, maybe right a few wrongs
I'd hit the studio just to write a few songs

[Chorus]
If I had a time machine I'd go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And Why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Chorus]
Jump in my time machine and go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And Why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Verse 2: Jin]
For the sake of argument let's say I did find a way
And was capable of going back to any time or day
Like September eleven, then I'd have the chance to
Beg and plead until every last flight was canceled
Go further back to clean more than smoke
Warn 'em to keep a close eye on the floor of the votes
I'd tell martin and Malcolm how I respect they passion
To see change in justice, watch for the assassins
And meeting Bruce would be history itself
Maybe study Martial Arts with Mr. Lee himself
I'd tell Biggie to run the lights, don't stop, son
And Pac, somethin' ain't right, don't ride shotgun
The good die young, we all know, but how come?
And since we know why we can't change the outcome
I try to make a difference, but reality remains
That the script's been written, so my efforts are in vain

[Chorus]
If I had a time machine I'd go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Chorus]
Jump in my time machine and go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Verse 3: Jin]
What about my future and the road that lies ahead
Should I take a glimpse or be surprised instead?
Think I'll sneak-a-peak, I see a road full of plex
No more gimmicks, critics say I'm more skilled, in fact
Hate to say I told you so, but honestly speaking
Finally got the respect I'm constantly seeking
After the acclaim think I'll settle down
One wife, two kids, I'm out the ghetto now
I'm lying to myself, my life's a complete waste
A bitter-sweet sorrow, that's just how defeat taste's
I has been forgotten, I'm yesterday's news
No longer relevant, Jin was expected to loose
Can't see that is my destiny so I'm lookin' past
My twenty-twenty vision blurred  through the lookin' glass
At last I choose to walk a path of my own
I've come this far but the other half is unknown

[Chorus]
If I had a time machine I'd go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
Andwhy not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Chorus]
Jump in my time machine and go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[The beat continues][Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh

[Verse 1]
I been doin this for so long started out with just
A dream
Something told me
Hold on
We gon make
It to the top
Felt the world
Was sleepin on me
But I never stopped now they wakin’ up to smell the coffee
And it cost me
Whole lotta
Blood sweat and tears just tellin
My own story
I call it the
Wonder years
Now I got it figured out and its never been
The same
Uh uh
Bring on the money and the fame
That ain’t my motivation nah I’m quite the simple guy
But if I said
I didn’t care about it that would be a lie
Maybe I don’t fit in
Who am I kiddin
Been waitin
My whole life
Just to get in

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me
Your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute look how far I came
From watching on the sidelines
I’m finally in the game
Now the pressures on but how can I complain
Ain’t this what I wanted tell me
Are you entertained
Cause when I had the crown you were
Claiming that you love me turn around
And put me down
Now you
Thinking nothing of me okay thats cool
God bless you
Amen
I rather have genuine haters
Than a bunch of fake friends
So pardon me
If I choose not to be around ya’ll
Just when things are looking up
You hoping for my downfall
15 minutes
And it’s going by quick
I know you counting down the seconds like (tick tick tick)

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere

[Teesa's Verse]
Yeah you
Do what it takes for the fame
To rush up to you but the clock ticks away
And the game is left up to you yeah you
Do what it takes for the fame
To rush up to you but the clock ticks away
And the game is left up to you

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere welcome to the club and I ain’t goin nowhere I know you see me
And I ain’t goin nowhereAnnotate[Intro]
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me

[Verse 1: Jin]
When they hit you in the chest you gon' feel this
They say I ain't the best well thats okay I'm the realest
Don't be fooled this man game is smoke and mirrors
What you hear what you see dont get caught up in appearance
Don't want to be a slave to my own image those days are finished (Lord help me)
I just want to see the big picture even if its by my selfie
You can have the world I just want the freedom ain't nothing ya'll can tell me
I know what your thinking (thats ill) (not uh) thats healthy
They look at us like "Lord they be winning" Nah we just over here keeping a tradition
See life can pass you buy better get up on that bus
I slow down and smell the roses ain't no need for me to rush

[Hook: Jin]
(Yeah) We gon' blow up when the times right
We were sent here to get your mind right
You see them hatin' because we gifted
We ain't even tryna be different

Yeah we still WINNING WINNING WINNING
We ain't tryna be different we WINNING WINNING WINNING
We ain't tryna be different we WINNING (hey) WINNING (hey) WINNING (hey)


[Verse 2: Jin]
