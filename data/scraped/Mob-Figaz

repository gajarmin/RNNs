[Verse One: C-Bo]

Twenty five years old, still tryin to make a livin off-a
One live, then they're only slugs give a nigga
Fuck holes in my chest, took my last breath
I, squeeze my Mag and I'm taggin him to his death ridah
Surpise the whole block when we slide up
An expedition in business, holdin them 9's up
First to die be the first nigga that speak
Murdered to death in the Killafornia streets
I live my life behind a pistol, smash for the cash
Bitch, life is too short that's why we murdered your ass
Give a shout to y'all homies, gave your pussy to a thug nigga
And all the cops they gave their money to the drug dealers
Dump slugs on all y'all piggies, that club nigga
And big dicks is why you white bitches love niggas
A black warrior, finger on the fuckin trigger
Before I die bet they realise I'm a real nigga

[Chorus: C-Bo]

It ain't no clowin this trick, real niggas'll load clips
Pushin luxury cars, when we dip
It's all about stackin them chips, makin that long money flip
And haters that trip a click to catch clips, for real niggas
*repeat*

[Verse Two: The Jacka]

Bailin times, fuck it, Mob Figgas'll get the bustin
Ain't no exit out the dip, stuck is how I'm livin
Driven to be that male factor
It's like I have ???? a boot cha or do ya out the frame, and loot the cash
Rush ya, bust ya, with fo'-fifths and extra clips
Entrepeneur, check my profile, that Mob nigga now
Pushin weight to my Eastend loc, he called me *?craze is grey?*
Like Tony but never phony, that bitch ???? ????

[Verse 3: Ap-9]
I'm bringin it to em like this, Mob Figgas, real niggas down to kill niggas
Five niggas, live niggas, lick and do or die, nigga
Nine's nigga's time's tickin when I blow your mind, nigga
Call me AP-9, nigga, boogie's when we rhyme, nigga
I hit the block and have it sold
See my freakers hittin vicious on them po's, that's the way the game goes
On tre-low, I stay low, dippin crate loads
Never had my niggas leavin nappy, runnin big blocks and cavi

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Husalah]

It's the husalah, you figure out I pack the biggest strap
Boy, I get savage, fold some cabbage, paper chasin is effect
Real niggas lost the fake, and a war that's takin place
You might get chopped up by the gauge, you ain't the kind that can't relate
Walk and trip into my car, stompin a chop off in my drawers
It's the hustler verse em all, so I blast if it's called fo'
Your detective ass wears raw do', real niggas keepin it inside do'
While real niggas is ridin, that's how we flex when we despise

[Verse 4: Rydah J Kylde]
The Mob Figgas, I grew up with these niggas
Trust my life for real niggas, ??? be the first to blast
So I don't have no fear, when I'm out here
But life still be makin me sick
Had to feel the Gleec kick and see heat rip flesh from the unfortunate
Allah bless your soul
I know I was wrong but he crossed the real
So I prayed that you will have understandin and feel
My story, when it's time to wrestle niggas to respect

[Verse 5: Fed-X)
Real niggas out to get, out to get it on
Screamin "Fuck em all" wit my back against the wall
They can't hold me back, I be the first to dump
On the worthless filth punk as he jump, felts kick from the pump
When my nuts was young, we see they hung to the floor
And when they severs 2-11's like teflon dyin out the door
What they know? We Mob Figgas, born in them savage times
Fuck your average ass rhymes, nigga

[Chorus](AP.9) I Know these streets are cold so much drama I pack my heat beacuase a nigga killed my momma now I'mma release some heat for the fact I'm black held back by the white mans law thats way i breakem no flaws ??? With a crack in my draws me and my
Figaz stick together like glue[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I'm thugged out enough to beat your fucking ass right now
I'll make your best rap wack with a rap right now
Cuz I'm the jacka the calidod pack the yay sacker
Tell your bitch to shut the fuck up for I slap her
Yea the jacka the spectacular my hold makes me
Look like dacula plus the young mob nigga that's smother shit
For the scrill my real niggas noting know who it feels

[Verse 2: Fed X]
Put your guns up gather your troops up
Your shoot wasn't bust out but your aim wasn't good enough
You claim killa you did what I did
But I'm a natural born killa you and me at the same nigga
You get your gun tooken to war about to jump off
You fell to the floor you should close your eyes
Didn't jump off get your mack snatched use your own gat
You know what I want run this shit or get your skull capped blown back

[Hook: C-Bo]
Bitch open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit you on your way
To your grave bitch we born killaz
Open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit you to your
Muthafucking grave bitch

[Verse 3: Hustla]
Shot caller now hit the block park the car cock the chop
Nothing but street star hustla hustla nigga what
Like my pops hops to diction hustler I'm spin shots
Watch before your watch visits
I'm in your wrist watches is not a movie
Your favorite rapper catch a slug in his booty
On the ground, screaming like a bitch
Caught the whole click thought he knew me nigga huh

[Verse 4: C-Bo]
Mini fourteen holler from out the window
Can't handle the static get stuffed in the casket murder
Them bastards grab my ak off the shelf
Find the destination and send them niggas to hell
My occupation is a must that I stack G'z
And I done hit more licks that the these
Believe that I'm loco with the pulled off fo fo in your front door
Will have you butt-naked taped on the floor

[Hook: C-Bo]
Bitch open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit you on your way
To your grave bitch we born killaz
Open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit your to your
Muthafucking grave bitch

[Verse 5: Ridah]
I was too young to understand why they shot at me
But how can I remain a solder at ease and let the release
THE FAG they try to get me to participate
Not at this rate and see my though strong try to recoupe me
Before I'm there and gone like the Apostles

[Verse 6: ap9]
Stuck in this world without no help
Niggas don't know we play for self and for keeps
Late night streets when niggas dump heat no retreat
Cuz the feats on my tracks
Without my five eating off this platinum plaque
For the fact that niggas ain't shit so they blaze
Turn the page off the rage in a maze
When they can't squabble fuck stuck in a face off
Soaking up more coke as I erase you job
Better duck when the bullets fly

[Hook]A soldiers paradise
You can't fuck with that

[The Jacka]
Smoking robalaids for hop
Now I'm hooked, I can't stop
Twist a chop, hop in a 500 drop
With the big homie Bo loc drive slow
I got the four benz I'll be the twins on me
Peeling 80 off the Alize
Time to put in work
Knocking now watching where I'm aiming out the candy gray Mercedes
Dam near going crazy in these savage last days
Busting the suckas on sight' a soldiers paradise, a soldiers paradise

[Hustlah]
Now it's the Hustlah nigga I like to light ya'll
But still I dwell a soldier's paradise
Hustlah kill cops
We ain't care about they whereabouts
We operate dee
Poppin' and keepin' the 5 on dubs
Smash into the club
Vests on our chests cuz there ain't no love from the other side
They hate on ya'll niggas cuz they get the scrilla
Make it multiply
Fuck them broke niggas
Mob Figaz increasin them homicides
Packing them choppers like [?] baby mama's cry
A soldier's paradise

[Bathgate]
A muthafuckin' soldier
25 trying to have mail
Swimming through the hood
Like a big whale, big daddy
Like a mobster eating lobster at the penthouse
Trying to have a million or two, no doubt
Bathgate got the clout nigga forever in or out
We blow yo brains out
CD's, slang from the bay to the south
Ate off waited like a gangster at his house

[The Jacka]
A soldier's paradise sip in this game and pay the price
It's my life or your life and nigga I'm the shit
So I take yours quick
Won't even think to load the clip
And that's the way it is the way we live our life
A soldier's paradise
Selling yay to survive
Fresh and kayta by my side
Mob figas steady mobbin'
When it's time to ride
When it's time to ride

[Fed-X]
Heard it was major league, duck tape keys and mob thugs
Crooked detectives, made men, and a paid judge
Them Mob Figaz
Major pain is steady mobbin'
Going chaotic
Exotic hoes and exotic pros
You stacking seven figures, gold bars
And stop rhymes
We on our own bank
Swiss accounts worth real estate
The life of luxury and bitches feeling me, bitches feeling me

[Ridah]
It's only one ways in nigga, no ways out
I'm sworn in
It won't leave till I'm popped up and carried out
Smoked the snitches
Trust none of the bitches
Dig all the ditches for those that didn't listen
Ugh stay G off hennessey and weed
Bathgate hit the D.A
So we ain't sweated by the P.D.'s
Mob Figaz not your ordinary niggas
Squeeze the automatic triggas
Made millionaire figaz

[AP.9]
A soldier's paradise that' always bearing a life long gone
And I was lookin' at my niggas telling me to hold on
I'm almost gone
I cried a few
Won't raise my tone
I'll blaze the chrome
Bust back at a nigga with the gauge it's on
His face is gone
We got ahead the chase is on
In a paradox this ain't paradise
I swear this life's been fucked up from the start
Half heart, half money nigga I paid my part
Now where's paradise

[Chorus: Crooked Eve] till fade
Soldier, soldier living in a soldier's paradise
Better watch your back
They out to get your scratch
In this game it's do or die[Ridah]
Man what they thought
That I'd give up and get caught
After I grabbed the nine
And headed straight for the fault
When it ain't never been a battle
That I fought and lost
Without my opponent being traced out in chalk
But I still ain't satisfied
So peep the rapid fire
This'll be the day I die
Fuck rappin' I'll retire
Negotiators say they'll provide
The paper I desire
But he's a liar
Cuz I'm tired of being lied to
So we die too, I ride through
Bustin' wit the hostages
Shielding me, yielding me
From the cops and shit
Spectators syndicate of how to stop this kid
But it's too late
I fear no fate, plus shoot straight
And it's funny
That all I ever wanted was some money
And someone to suck me like they had no teeth
Now all of a sudden these muthafuckas wanna know me
Calm me down, sayin "Ridah let the hostages free"
But I'm on some fuck the world shit and I don't know
I guess I'm stressed off the bullshit
But they don't know me like they think they do
To the whole world nigga

Chorus: [Ridah]
You don't know me like you think you do
If you buying I sit down and have this drink with you
But still you don't know me like you think you do
I was strapped the time you had yo heat with you
You don't know me, you don't know me like you think you do
If you buying I sit down and have this drink with you
But still you don't know me like you think you do
I was strapped the time you had yo heat with you
You don't know

[Hustlah]
I was in the back seat
Tacked out sipping yak
Keep burnin' my chest
Dropping ashes from my skull
Cherry burnin' my flesh and I can't feel it
Cuz something's wrong
Touchin' my gat was also peelin' it
And I'm feelin' strong
Look up and all I seen was two niggas' dome
And my cousin Clyde sayin'
"Lil' Cutty hold on"
But the feelin' was strong like I said
One in the chamber on my thang
Wear a beam on they head
Tryin' to stop
But my fingers kept holdin' on
Hella [?] I wish [?] the car [?] wrapped around a pole
And I'm out cold
Smith and Wesson in my hand
And a couple of songs in my pocket
As I bail from the [?] [?] gone
What the fuck one minute was on way home
Next one I'm hittin' gauges with blood stains on my clothes
Now I ain't worried about my PCP though [?][?] for a second
Or Two niggas get smoked
Was it somethin' I drank or
Was it somethin' I smoked
All these niggas think they know me
When they really don't know
Damn it's killing me slow
Think I'm a rapper but he's dealin' his coke
It's the only way I still lounge and chill with my folks

[AP 9]
You better back up
Give me some room, stack up
Before I jack ya, on a platoon
We be them niggas and I blast ya silly muthafucka
You not knowing me who asked ya
I wouldn't put it past ya
I'm movin' faster
In the fast lane the fast life causing disasters
These niggas actin' like the dons we the last ones
Wit a gat in my palm
I'm pullin' fast ones
These suckers actin' like they really want some
Come get some
I'm getting dumb
Dumpin' hollow's with your death day
So catch your breath man
Somebody better hold me
That's what they told me
The ghetto is tryin' to kill me
Cuz I'm constantly gettin' silly
Just a thug nigga
I roll with ridahs and hustlahs
We dumping slugs nigga
And we don't fuck with no bustas
But I love niggas
Who get they thug on and the drugs on
Police jockin' me
Told my little cousin that they watchin' me
Stoppin' me, poppin' me
They wanna see AP not breath like Pac see
I live the young, the good life
The mob life foo
But you don't know me like you think you do

[Hook]

[Fed X]
It all happened in a Lincoln limo
I'm talkin' business
With a [?] cap by the name of Leo
Was supposed to be his so called nephew
A Coleone that was sellin' it
For two times cheaper than what his uncle do
I should of knew I couldn't trust him
The snake in the grass
Crossed his van
Throw that kilo in the shape top grab
Set me up
The Feds needed a bust
A paid cat from the Bureau
That his own team couldn't trust
They call me Groupie Don
Had to get him for nine
A ball head nut from Frisco
Who sold his pistols by the crate
And [?] with missiles and hand grenades
They don't know
It's all a fad

[The Jacka]
And I could tell them on my way
Just a few more moves I gotta make
And a few more chances I gotta take
Being in the Mob
Every job is a promise I can't break
The fast lane
Yeah so much cash came
The Feds know my name
But they don't know my face
My young nigga got caught
When a cape caught a case
Any time you will waste
G'z on a lawyer
Only to get 34 years
Chest to the floor
Push-ups till your chest gets soft
Muthafuckas ain't shit
Only let a nigga know
When I predict
As time changes playas become haters
Even if you knew me for hella long
You will still be a stranger
You don't know me nigga[Phone conversation for 25 seconds]

[Bart]
We on a paper chase!
I see it all through my third eye
You played it fast so we ??? push it worldwide
It's juss a mental suicide, Kamakazie
Got the plug on this game, so we on the plane Friday
Finally, its a motherfuckin hit
Clicks fists of four-fifths, Steady Mobb in this bitch
I see his eyes wide, his wig split up
On some murderous an half of his mutha
Fuckin clan was on some other shit scramblin
Them bullets through his skin tissue
It's America's host
You knew the game never fit you
It's all official
His last breath was on his line front
Immortalized, his time has come

[Hook 2X: Bart]
Immortalized!
Blood shot red my eyes
When the gun shots spread the skies it ain't no where to hide
I swear to God, a credit card can't account for the hate
Boy it's too late, theres no escape we already plannin ya wake

[Keek Da Sneak]
Uh, break me down
Roll me up an hit it
Don't shake me now
Take another hit, I want you to feel it
This the realest
This is what you'll be hearin through the backstreets, starrin
Hit the baron
But dont forget, always check ya side views, an ya rear-end
Niggas fearin, for the fact that you havin paper, an you dealin
Ridin fetti, an a couple of hatas gon catch you when you ain't ready
Like Redman, take it ??? ??? from the back
To the head from lettin it seen ???
Casket bed me
But instead me, I'mma live through it all
I spit an fall
I've been feelin like that since 2 Raw
Like Above The Law
I was off that V-S
Bitin titties through the bra
An nigga we juss
Get a kick outta breakin the law
An then dig this
Cuttie that be breakin me off
An I need this
So I'm tryin to snatch it all
Its scratch an fall
I'd rather stay on top an ball
So my family is set when death calls

[Hook]

[Ridah of Mob Figaz]
Now what they thought?
That I'd give up an get caught
After I
Grab the nine an headed straight for the vault
When there ain't never been a battle that I fought an lost
Wit out my... opponnent bein traced out in chalk
But I still ain't satisfied
So peep the rapid-fire
This'll be the day I die, fuck rappin, I'll retire
Negotiators said he'll provide, the paper I desire
But he's a liar
An I'm tired of bein lied too
So we die too, when I ride through
Bustin in wit the hostages
Killin me, the guilt in me, fuck the cops an shit
Spectators see the caper, holla "Stop this kid!"
But its too late
I fear no fate, plus shootin straight
An its funny
Cuz all I ever wanted was some money
An someone to suck me like they had no teeth
Now all of a sudden these motherfuckers wanna know me
Call me down, sayin "Ridah let the hostages free!"
But I'm on some, fuck the world shit, an I don't know
I guess I'm stressed off the bullshit

[Fed-X of the Mob Figaz]
I've done adapted to this environment
Now they can't stop me
A Mob Figga
Military tactics menace to society
One of the chosen five
That lead immortal lives
Snatchin' all the product
Breakin' every bone in the closet
I'm out to get the data
The top secret information got me took
I'm bendin' every law in the book
I fled the scene with two nines in the sky
Sereal number scraped with no trace
And known to race
To get this pace
Imported weapons
Army fatigues and body vests
I'm restin', for armageddon, with the illuminati
Tales of Demias, Twentieth century, raised right
It's third war!!
Busted hinges and broken doors
Interrogation and infiltration on the five
Immortalized!

[Hook]

Nigga!

You know what I'm sayin?
We've known to hustle since the beginning of civilization
Until this motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin.... burn out
That's all it's gon be
We ain't did nothin but breed in this shit
You know what I'm sayin
Young niggas... you know what I'm sayin... all of us
You know what I'm sayin
All of us
Get ya money, watch them lights
Knock on you, knock on me
Fuck it, you know what I'm sayin, til it's over wit
Thug it out til the end of civilization
You know what I'm sayin?
Against all odds
Until we die, ride until we die
Mobbin it out, Money Ova Bitches
Money ova all that shit
First priority, it's over all of it
Niggas ain't goin no where, we in this motherfucker
Until this motherfucker
Go, until this motherfucker burn out!
FUCK IT!! {*echoes out*}Real motherfuckers man
You gotta hustle just to beat the struggle
I know

[Fed-Ex]
You couldn't fuck wit me
If we was runnin' trains together
Heard you keep your heat under your pillow
OK whatever, you's the victim
In and out of jail was me
Frontin' drugs to thugs
So who else could it be
I let the nine fetch ya
Bitch nigga, you catch the stretcher
I'm all about perfection
I run more blocks than you ran
When they was dumpin' you was actin' like a scared man
I boosted up my prices
Like the price of power
Or the cost of gas
We get money by the hour
Move fork on a hustla
I was raised that way
Young thugs on the block
Been out there all day
Catch me hustlin' in the rain feelin' pain that way

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You gotta hustle just to bet the struggle, I know
You gotta bust down doors
Go and get it for doe
Don't nobody wanna see you live
You know why?
Cuz everybody wanna see you die
And that's real

[Fed-Ex]
All the way in New York
Cali on my plates
Funk Master Flex hit the tunnel for a day
Giving depth to them big stack holders
Dirty money folders pushin' valves on the corner
Cracks under they tongue
Garlic's on they shelves
Bodies on they guns
Chickens in the business
Celebrate when they done
Through the light like it's green
In my Benz, roadies fiilin' my team
Hittin' weed that's the ? off my jeans
California dream, and I'm livin' it up
Up in Vegas at the magic show blowin' a buck
Spittin' more in niggas' face
Then the police done laced
I'm a boss at the top of the list
Come fuck wit me
Drug indictment, how could it be
Got runner's pushin' crack
Got runner's pushin' ? than me

[Chorus]

[Fed-Ex]
To all my G's up in a duffle bag
How would you approach it?
Wit your demo wit your gun out
Barrel already smokin'
Never A-rab wit this rap cat down on the floor
Or push it off on the North Star on highway 4
Reckless drivin'
A grown man locked in the trunk
Fed him a sock for lunch
Or a hog, tying him up
Yeah you know
The type a shit that happens in the ghetto
Heavy metal get pierced if you ain't careful
And that's real
I seen as the shit go down
Like being locked in a box
Buried under the ground
We do it mob style
And I swear that on my kids
If you come searchin' for clues and get did

[Chorus][Ridah]
Man what they thought
That I'd give up and get caught
After I grabbed the nine
And headed straight for the fault
When it ain't never been a battle

You get your gun tooken to war about to jump off
You fell to the floor you should close your eyes
Didn't jump off get your mack snatched use your own gat
You know what I want run this shit or get your skull capped blown back

[Hook: C-Bo]
Bitch open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit you on your way
To your grave bitch we born killaz
Open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit you to your
Muthafucking grave bitch

[Verse 3: Hustla]
Shot caller now hit the block park the car cock the chop
Nothing but street star hustla hustla nigga what
Like my pops hops to diction hustler I'm spin shots
Watch before your watch visits
I'm in your wrist watches is not a movie
Your favorite rapper catch a slug in his booty
On the ground, screaming like a bitch
Caught the whole click thought he knew me nigga huh

[Verse 4: C-Bo]
Mini fourteen holler from out the window
Can't handle the static get stuffed in the casket murder
Them bastards grab my ak off the shelf
Find the destination and send them niggas to hell
My occupation is a must that I stack G'z
And I done hit more licks that the these
Believe that I'm loco with the pulled off fo fo in your front door
Will have you butt-naked taped on the floor

[Hook: C-Bo]
Bitch open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit you on your way
To your grave bitch we born killaz
Open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit your to your
Muthafucking grave bitch

[Verse 5: Ridah]
I was too young to understand why they shot at me
But how can I remain a solder at ease and let the release
THE FAG they try to get me to participate
Not at this rate and see my though strong try to recoupe me
Before I'm there and gone like the Apostles

[Verse 6: ap9]
Stuck in this world without no help
Niggas don't know we play for self and for keeps
Late night streets when niggas dump heat no retreat
Cuz the feats on my tracks
Without my five eating off this platinum plaque
For the fact that niggas ain't shit so they blaze
Turn the page off the rage in a maze
When they can't squabble fuck stuck in a face off
Soaking up more coke as I erase you job
Better duck when the bullets fly

[Hook][Phone conversation for 25 seconds]

[Bart]
We on a paper chase!
I see it all through my third eye
You played it fast so we ??? push it worldwide
It's juss a mental suicide, Kamakazie
Got the plug on this game, so we on the plane Friday
Finally, its a motherfuckin hit
Clicks fists of four-fifths, Steady Mobb in this bitch
I see his eyes wide, his wig split up
On some murderous an half of his mutha
Fuckin clan was on some other shit scramblin
Them bullets through his skin tissue
It's America's host
You knew the game never fit you
It's all official
His last breath was on his line front
Immortalized, his time has come

[Hook 2X: Bart]
Immortalized!
Blood shot red my eyes
When the gun shots spread the skies it ain't no where to hide
I swear to God, a credit card can't account for the hate
Boy it's too late, theres no escape we already plannin ya wake

[Keek Da Sneak]
Uh, break me down
Roll me up an hit it
Don't shake me now
Take another hit, I want you to feel it
This the realest
This is what you'll be hearin through the backstreets, starrin
Hit the baron
But dont forget, always check ya side views, an ya rear-end
Niggas fearin, for the fact that you havin paper, an you dealin
Ridin fetti, an a couple of hatas gon catch you when you ain't ready
Like Redman, take it ??? ??? from the back
To the head from lettin it seen ???
Casket bed me
But instead me, I'mma live through it all
I spit an fall
I've been feelin like that since 2 Raw
Like Above The Law
I was off that V-S
Bitin titties through the bra
An nigga we juss
Get a kick outta breakin the law
An then dig this
Cuttie that be breakin me off
An I need this
So I'm tryin to snatch it all
Its scratch an fall
I'd rather stay on top an ball
So my family is set when death calls

[Hook]

[Ridah of Mob Figaz]
Now what they thought?
That I'd give up an get caught
After I
Grab the nine an headed straight for the vault
When there ain't never been a battle that I fought an lost
Wit out my... opponnent bein traced out in chalk
But I still ain't satisfied
So peep the rapid-fire
This'll be the day I die, fuck rappin, I'll retire
Negotiators said he'll provide, the paper I desire
But he's a liar
An I'm tired of bein lied too
So we die too, when I ride through
Bustin in wit the hostages
Killin me, the guilt in me, fuck the cops an shit
Spectators see the caper, holla "Stop this kid!"
But its too late
I fear no fate, plus shootin straight
An its funny
Cuz all I ever wanted was some money
An someone to suck me like they had no teeth
Now all of a sudden these motherfuckers wanna know me
Call me down, sayin "Ridah let the hostages free!"
But I'm on some, fuck the world shit, an I don't know
I guess I'm stressed off the bullshit

[Fed-X of the Mob Figaz]
I've done adapted to this environment
Now they can't stop me
A Mob Figga
Military tactics menace to society
One of the chosen five
That lead immortal lives
Snatchin' all the product
Breakin' every bone in the closet
I'm out to get the data
The top secret information got me took
I'm bendin' every law in the book
I fled the scene with two nines in the sky
Sereal number scraped with no trace
And known to race
To get this pace
Imported weapons
Army fatigues and body vests
I'm restin', for armageddon, with the illuminati
Tales of Demias, Twentieth century, raised right
It's third war!!
Busted hinges and broken doors
Interrogation and infiltration on the five
Immortalized!

[Hook]

Nigga!

You know what I'm sayin?
We've known to hustle since the beginning of civilization
Until this motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin.... burn out
That's all it's gon be
We ain't did nothin but breed in this shit
You know what I'm sayin
Young niggas... you know what I'm sayin... all of us
You know what I'm sayin
All of us
Get ya money, watch them lights
Knock on you, knock on me
Fuck it, you know what I'm sayin, til it's over wit
Thug it out til the end of civilization
You know what I'm sayin?
Against all odds
Until we die, ride until we die
Mobbin it out, Money Ova Bitches
Money ova all that shit
First priority, it's over all of it
Niggas ain't goin no where, we in this motherfucker
Until this motherfucker
Go, until this motherfucker burn out!
FUCK IT!! {*echoes out*}[Verse One: C-Bo]

Twenty five years old, still tryin to make a livin off-a
One live, then they're only slugs give a nigga
Fuck holes in my chest, took my last breath
I, squeeze my Mag and I'm taggin him to his death ridah
Surpise the whole block when we slide up
An expedition in business, holdin them 9's up
First to die be the first nigga that speak
Murdered to death in the Killafornia streets
I live my life behind a pistol, smash for the cash
Bitch, life is too short that's why we murdered your ass
Give a shout to y'all homies, gave your pussy to a thug nigga
And all the cops they gave their money to the drug dealers
Dump slugs on all y'all piggies, that club nigga
And big dicks is why you white bitches love niggas
A black warrior, finger on the fuckin trigger
Before I die bet they realise I'm a real nigga

[Chorus: C-Bo]

It ain't no clowin this trick, real niggas'll load clips
Pushin luxury cars, when we dip
It's all about stackin them chips, makin that long money flip
And haters that trip a click to catch clips, for real niggas
*repeat*

[Verse Two: The Jacka]

Bailin times, fuck it, Mob Figgas'll get the bustin
Ain't no exit out the dip, stuck is how I'm livin
Driven to be that male factor
It's like I have ???? a boot cha or do ya out the frame, and loot the cash
Rush ya, bust ya, with fo'-fifths and extra clips
Entrepeneur, check my profile, that Mob nigga now
Pushin weight to my Eastend loc, he called me *?craze is grey?*
Like Tony but never phony, that bitch ???? ????

[Verse 3: Ap-9]
I'm bringin it to em like this, Mob Figgas, real niggas down to kill niggas
Five niggas, live niggas, lick and do or die, nigga
Nine's nigga's time's tickin when I blow your mind, nigga
Call me AP-9, nigga, boogie's when we rhyme, nigga
I hit the block and have it sold
See my freakers hittin vicious on them po's, that's the way the game goes
On tre-low, I stay low, dippin crate loads
Never had my niggas leavin nappy, runnin big blocks and cavi

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Husalah]

It's the husalah, you figure out I pack the biggest strap
Boy, I get savage, fold some cabbage, paper chasin is effect
Real niggas lost the fake, and a war that's takin place
You might get chopped up by the gauge, you ain't the kind that can't relate
Walk and trip into my car, stompin a chop off in my drawers
It's the hustler verse em all, so I blast if it's called fo'
Your detective ass wears raw do', real niggas keepin it inside do'
While real niggas is ridin, that's how we flex when we despise

[Verse 4: Rydah J Kylde]
The Mob Figgas, I grew up with these niggas
Trust my life for real niggas, ??? be the first to blast
So I don't have no fear, when I'm out here
But life still be makin me sick
Had to feel the Gleec kick and see heat rip flesh from the unfortunate
Allah bless your soul
I know I was wrong but he crossed the real
So I prayed that you will have understandin and feel
My story, when it's time to wrestle niggas to respect

[Verse 5: Fed-X)
Real niggas out to get, out to get it on
Screamin "Fuck em all" wit my back against the wall
They can't hold me back, I be the first to dump
On the worthless filth punk as he jump, felts kick from the pump
When my nuts was young, we see they hung to the floor
And when they severs 2-11's like teflon dyin out the door
What they know? We Mob Figgas, born in them savage times
Fuck your average ass rhymes, nigga

[Chorus]A soldiers paradise
You can't fuck with that

[The Jacka]
Smoking robalaids for hop
Now I'm hooked, I can't stop
Twist a chop, hop in a 500 drop
With the big homie Bo loc drive slow
I got the four benz I'll be the twins on me
Peeling 80 off the Alize
Time to put in work
Knocking now watching where I'm aiming out the candy gray Mercedes
Dam near going crazy in these savage last days
Busting the suckas on sight' a soldiers paradise, a soldiers paradise

[Hustlah]
Now it's the Hustlah nigga I like to light ya'll
But still I dwell a soldier's paradise
Hustlah kill cops
We ain't care about they whereabouts
We operate dee
Poppin' and keepin' the 5 on dubs
Smash into the club
Vests on our chests cuz there ain't no love from the other side
They hate on ya'll niggas cuz they get the scrilla
Make it multiply
Fuck them broke niggas
Mob Figaz increasin them homicides
Packing them choppers like [?] baby mama's cry
A soldier's paradise

[Bathgate]
A muthafuckin' soldier
25 trying to have mail
Swimming through the hood
Like a big whale, big daddy
Like a mobster eating lobster at the penthouse
Trying to have a million or two, no doubt
Bathgate got the clout nigga forever in or out
We blow yo brains out
CD's, slang from the bay to the south
Ate off waited like a gangster at his house

[The Jacka]
A soldier's paradise sip in this game and pay the price
It's my life or your life and nigga I'm the shit
So I take yours quick
Won't even think to load the clip
And that's the way it is the way we live our life
A soldier's paradise
Selling yay to survive
Fresh and kayta by my side
Mob figas steady mobbin'
When it's time to ride
When it's time to ride

[Fed-X]
Heard it was major league, duck tape keys and mob thugs
Crooked detectives, made men, and a paid judge
Them Mob Figaz
Major pain is steady mobbin'
Going chaotic
Exotic hoes and exotic pros
You stacking seven figures, gold bars
And stop rhymes
We on our own bank
Swiss accounts worth real estate
The life of luxury and bitches feeling me, bitches feeling me

[Ridah]
It's only one ways in nigga, no ways out
I'm sworn in
It won't leave till I'm popped up and carried out
Smoked the snitches
Trust none of the bitches
Dig all the ditches for those that didn't listen
Ugh stay G off hennessey and weed
Bathgate hit the D.A
So we ain't sweated by the P.D.'s
Mob Figaz not your ordinary niggas
Squeeze the automatic triggas
Made millionaire figaz

[AP.9]
A soldier's paradise that' always bearing a life long gone
And I was lookin' at my niggas telling me to hold on
I'm almost gone
I cried a few
Won't raise my tone
I'll blaze the chrome
Bust back at a nigga with the gauge it's on
His face is gone
We got ahead the chase is on
In a paradox this ain't paradise
I swear this life's been fucked up from the start
Half heart, half money nigga I paid my part
Now where's paradise

[Chorus: Crooked Eve] till fade
Soldier, soldier living in a soldier's paradise
Better watch your back
They out to get your scratch
In this game it's do or dieReal motherfuckers man
You gotta hustle just to beat the struggle
I know

[Fed-Ex]
You couldn't fuck wit me
If we was runnin' trains together
Heard you keep your heat under your pillow
OK whatever, you's the victim
In and out of jail was me
Frontin' drugs to thugs
So who else could it be
I let the nine fetch ya
Bitch nigga, you catch the stretcher
I'm all about perfection
I run more blocks than you ran
When they was dumpin' you was actin' like a scared man
I boosted up my prices
Like the price of power
Or the cost of gas
We get money by the hour
Move fork on a hustla
I was raised that way
Young thugs on the block
Been out there all day
Catch me hustlin' in the rain feelin' pain that way

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You gotta hustle just to bet the struggle, I know
You gotta bust down doors
Go and get it for doe
Don't nobody wanna see you live
You know why?
Cuz everybody wanna see you die
And that's real

[Fed-Ex]
All the way in New York
Cali on my plates
Funk Master Flex hit the tunnel for a day
Giving depth to them big stack holders
Dirty money folders pushin' valves on the corner
Cracks under they tongue
Garlic's on they shelves
Bodies on they guns
Chickens in the business
Celebrate when they done
Through the light like it's green
In my Benz, roadies fiilin' my team
Hittin' weed that's the ? off my jeans
California dream, and I'm livin' it up
Up in Vegas at the magic show blowin' a buck
Spittin' more in niggas' face
Then the police done laced
I'm a boss at the top of the list
Come fuck wit me
Drug indictment, how could it be
Got runner's pushin' crack
Got runner's pushin' ? than me

[Chorus]

[Fed-Ex]
To all my G's up in a duffle bag
How would you approach it?
Wit your demo wit your gun out
Barrel already smokin'
Never A-rab wit this rap cat down on the floor
Or push it off on the North Star on highway 4
Reckless drivin'
A grown man locked in the trunk
Fed him a sock for lunch
Or a hog, tying him up
Yeah you know
The type a shit that happens in the ghetto
Heavy metal get pierced if you ain't careful
And that's real
I seen as the shit go down
Like being locked in a box
Buried under the ground
We do it mob style
And I swear that on my kids
If you come searchin' for clues and get did

[Chorus]
