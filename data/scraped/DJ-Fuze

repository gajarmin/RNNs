[Intro: 2Pac]
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground when we come around
Stronger than ever

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps paging me!
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me...lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayyo bust it, baby got a problem saying "bye-bye"
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask "why?" Don't matter! My pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me,
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

[Hook]
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

[Verse 2: Shock G]
Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G: the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

[Money B]
What's up love, how you doing?
Well I've been hanging, sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging?
Your home girl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister? - and your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone: why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around[Intro: Money B, and 2Pac]
Yeah, its another classic cassette, Goin Way Back Show, exclusive you know what it is
What you won't do... do for Love...
Hey yo let me rock this, let me rock this, let me rock this, check it out, check it out
Let me tell you a story about my homie and his girl, you know what I'm saying
Some Love triangle type shit, we going rock this shit right here
So dope beat to you know what I'm saying
We about to run through this
So yo check it out
Smooth you drop the vocals, and I'll smoke his ass

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I lay awake tonight because I want to be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see her the feeling gets stronger
We sit a bit closer and stare a lot longer, huh
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Went to mutter I stuttered cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win
Cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, I'm falling for his girlfriend
It's like a trap that I'm sinking in to
I wake up sweating when I'm sleeping cause I'm thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
Trying to shake it but the feeling comes right back
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep calling me saying to come over
What do I do, you make it hard for me to chose .. what I won't do for Love

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit, and pray hoping the beatings will go away
It wasn't always a hit, and run relationship
It used to be Love happiness, and companionship
Way back when he treated you good
Moved you up to the hills out the ill's of the ghetto hood
You felt as though you owed him your life
It felt right so you said yes now your really his wife
He got you pregnant but the baby just wouldn't live
Something she couldn't give so things got negative
But that's when a stranger came through
And he's pestering you about the things you couldn't do
You say your happy at home right
But that's just a lie, as you cry through a long night
Until I came to rescue you, making you chose ... what you won't do for Love

[Outro: 2Pac]
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, in the house, what you won't do for Love
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, what you won't do
Yo Smooth, kick and laugh while we giving shout outs to my homes' you know what I'm saying noow
Shock-G is in the house, yeah
Schmoovy-Schmoov is in the house, yeah
Kush is in the house, yeah
Ryan-G is in the house, yeah
Clark Gable in the house, yeah
Rick Rocks in the house, yeah
Fuze is in the house
And Money-B, you know he's in the house
Pee Wee is in the house
The Underground, is in the house
And the Jaketown is in the house, yeah, in the house
Oaktown, is in the house, Richtown, is in the house, yeah

What you won't do ...

What you won't do ...

Do for Love ..(Chorus: 4x)
"Always trying to blame a god damn nigga
900 blame a nigga"

(Verse 1 - Numskull)
How can I get blamed for shit
That a nigga really didn't even do
One nigga did the dirt, but the blames on the whole crew
I feel like O.J. and Rodney
A little mayo, but still don't be having no happy days like Potsy
Nigga's get blamed for every thang
From robbin you house, to ho stroll's
And the tropicana cocaine
And if the sun turned black
{"Yup a nigger did it Jim"} OR
{"get him over here so I blame it on him"}
Nigga's getttin (??) like the oldies
Played the fuck out, we only known for stealin cars and drinkin 40's
Or showin your whole ass crack on cops
They quick to do a nigga on the routine stop
Chopped rock's, in a nigga possesion, a whole zip
Blame me cause I'm one of fo' grips
Now you can have mayo and a gang of triggers
But that ain't shit, cause they still going to blame a nigga

(Chorus plays over REDNECK talking)
Boy I tell ya Jim, one of those black niggers took
The battery outta my car last night
I didn't see it, but I know those niggers ways

(Numskull)
Driving down the block, and what did I see
A police man trying to gaffle me
Threw down my rocks, so I wouldn't get caught
A high-speed CHASE for fourty-eight blocks

(Verse 2 - Yukmouth)
I heard some shit was goin down though
It might be scanda-lous, on the down low
Plus I get around ho, like Shock and Mon'
Walking to the lot, forgot I got the gun
In the bushes, more mayo then the rest of the pushers
Tonight a nigga might be readin my Nike's like Bushwick
Chronic smoke like chimney, to lit a doobie
They knew me, let me in free cause I be that Luni
Higher then the police sky waves off the blue
I partied two or three hours now I'm sideways in the sukra
To the hoopsta's, survival is the be-under
But I was in it, now five-oh's on my bumper
Ready to dump the forty outie, and weed baggies
They had me searchin through my car, for what we have we here
A queer tryna frame a nigga, but shame on a nigga
That try to put the blame on a nigga

(Chorus plays over REDNECK talking)
Uh, hello, this is 900 blame a nigger?
Uh, my daughter's raped, and comin back from
A Ku Klux Clan meetin, and I know a nigger did it

(Yukmouth)
Last night was the night before
Twenty-four robber's came knocking at my door
I ran out, they ran in, trying to blast for my cash
With ski-masks on they're chin

(Verse 3 - Luniz)
Take a puff from my hamp then bounce
I'm on a mission for scrilla, vanilla slugs by my zipper
Playa haters trippin off ho's it seems that they plot
Snitch to the cops, and swear that I chopped O's of cream
WHO STOLE THE COOKIE OUT THE COOKIE JAR!
That's what they mumble
Now knowin about THE POWER OF NUMSKULL!
Now I done had it wit all that static
I'm thinkin I should load my automatic
And let all these faggots have it

(Yukmouth)
One love, it's cocked backed, and then I bust slugs
Roastin a motherfucker, so busta always suffer
Blood in the ghetto, other niggas try to run up
Wit they gun, and get done from sun down to sun up, punk
Dead bodies in the trunk, they kept on tellin me
Oh I was sellin P.D. I was sellin D, I caught a felony
As soon as I got it, had to pop out a nigga brains
I was the wrong nigga to frame

(REDNECK talking while Chorus plays)
Boy I wish I could get a job
But them damn niggers take all the jobs nowadays
They got affirmative action stuff
I tell you that guy up in puff, he agreed to that stuff bad
Them, them niggas are gonna know where it's, hey...

(Yukmouth talking)
Wassup man, you all on my tape and shit
Talkin that weak shit, get the fuck up outta hear

(REDNECK)
Who are you, who are you!
You nigger's are tryna kill me!

(Yukmouth)
Get yo punk ass up outta here, peckerwood motherfucker
Jive ass turkey, that's right
I stole yo motherfuckin car
But aye, it's yo fault
Yo ass brought us from Africa, bitch
Aye get yo ass up outta here, you peckerwood motherfucker {*gunshots*}
Blast that fool man, blast that fool, get him, get him
He tryna run, blast that fool, yeah, talkin all that shit
Pointin the finger and shit, I'm tired of y'all
Pointin the fingers at motherfuckers mayne
Y'all done got O.J., Tyson, my potnah 2Pac, Gov
Man fuck blamin me, I didn't do it, WHY, fuck that you did itChorus *(Yukmouth)*

Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground when we come around
Stronger than ever

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps paging me!
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me...lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayyo bust it, baby got a problem saying "bye-bye"
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask "why?" Don't matter! My pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me,
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

[Hook]
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

[Verse 2: Shock G]
Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G: the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

[Money B]
What's up love, how you doing?
Well I've been hanging, sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging?
Your home girl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister? - and your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone: why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around[Intro: Money B, and 2Pac]
Yeah, its another classic cassette, Goin Way Back Show, exclusive you know what it is

Hey yo let me rock this, let me rock this, let me rock this, check it out, check it out
Let me tell you a story about my homie and his girl, you know what I'm saying
Some Love triangle type shit, we going rock this shit right here
So dope beat to you know what I'm saying
We about to run through this
So yo check it out
Smooth you drop the vocals, and I'll smoke his ass

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I lay awake tonight because I want to be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see her the feeling gets stronger
We sit a bit closer and stare a lot longer, huh
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Went to mutter I stuttered cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win
Cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, I'm falling for his girlfriend
It's like a trap that I'm sinking in to
I wake up sweating when I'm sleeping cause I'm thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
Trying to shake it but the feeling comes right back
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep calling me saying to come over
What do I do, you make it hard for me to chose .. what I won't do for Love

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit, and pray hoping the beatings will go away
It wasn't always a hit, and run relationship
It used to be Love happiness, and companionship
Way back when he treated you good
Moved you up to the hills out the ill's of the ghetto hood
You felt as though you owed him your life
It felt right so you said yes now your really his wife
He got you pregnant but the baby just wouldn't live
Something she couldn't give so things got negative
But that's when a stranger came through
And he's pestering you about the things you couldn't do
You say your happy at home right
But that's just a lie, as you cry through a long night
Until I came to rescue you, making you chose ... what you won't do for Love

[Outro: 2Pac]
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, in the house, what you won't do for Love
