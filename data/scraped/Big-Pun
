[Hook: Joe & Big Pun]
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player; I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're looking for
For my thugs, baby, for my thugs

Uptown baby, uptown
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player; I just fuck a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Who's down to fuck a lot

[Verse 1: Big Pun]
I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, ha see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beats French comteese, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Copping a 5-0 Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffing the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearing PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, running trains for three days
Who want to ride it; won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm big huh
I rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers, hold up
Choola, I'm all about getting loot
But I knock that boot if you out to get koofed

[Hook: Joe]

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional I'mma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin; I don't care
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks come

[Outro x2: Big Pun & Joe]
In the hot tub, popping bubbly
Rubbing your spot love, got you screaming punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like, don't stop, get it, get it

[Hook: Joe]

[Outro: Joe]
Boricua, morena
Boricua, morena[Big Punisher]
Ready for war Joe, how you wanna blow they spot
I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles, we'll do this dude while he's slurping spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fucking floor, Joey Crack
Buck em all if they move, Noodles shoot that fucking whore
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know
That we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly

[Fat Joe]
It'll be a cold day in hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake, smack you then I whack you with my snub trey-eight

[Big Punisher]
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville I drill the nerves in your cavity filling
Insanity's building a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support

[Fat Joe]
I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best -- might be
Even better leaving niggas kneeling on they right knee

[Big Punisher]
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture
You small change, I'm blowing out your brains getting richer

[Fat Joe]
Hit you with the Mac, smack your bitch, nigga what?
You getting stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck!

[Big Punisher]
Truck jewels, cruising in the Land, pumping "Cash Rules"
Last crew to want it caught a hundred trying to pass through

[Fat Joe]
That's true (So who the next to get it?)
TS the best that did it (Get it off your chest kid admit it and it's)

[Hook]
Yeah, and you don't stop!
(Twenty shot Glock with the cop killers fill 'em to the top)
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked)
Yeah, and you don't stop!
(We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop

[Big Punisher]
Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make em eat dirt
Take em feet first through the morgue, then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight I hold my rosary tight as I can
I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Latina mas fina but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

[Fat Joe]
Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kicking ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police, though
You should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

[Big Punisher]
Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashing catching niggas while they sleeping
No relaxing, keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three techses in the Jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-a-clips mob, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock Down

[Fat Joe]
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk, I prey like the Predator
Whoever want it, go and get it set it baby and I'mma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm repping
I fill a clip of my weapon and Punish niggas 'til it's armaggedeon

[Hook][Verse 1: Big Punisher]
You can catch me in the cherry red one-fifty
Got the grizzy locked in the stizzy
Pop the clizzy goin sixty down a one-wizzy
Drunk pissy, tryin to cruise through the avenue
While my peoples is poppin bottles up in Sue's rendevous
Fuck that, spun the U-ey lost a hubcap
It's back to the shack - came back in a "What's that?"
Straight from Paris, checkin Gaby's new baby carriage
Perry Ellis, auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer, got the Tec for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers, nuttin less cause it's reala
In the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one (eh eh) got beef bust yo' gun
You don't need no one (nope) talkin' bout that you owe him
I'mma go for dolo; Scarface without Manolo
One deep, I be solo, bustin' heat, throwin' bolos, it's hard
(And it's so hard, yeah)

[Hook: Donnell Jones]
Niggas wanna be like Pun, but they don't bust they guns
And it's so hard
Niggas wanna fuck my wife, niggas wanna take my life
But it's so hard

[Hook Adlibs 1: Big Punisher]
It's hard work baby
I just lost a hundred pounds, I'm tryin to live
I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm stayin alive baby
That's my wife, I paid for them titties
Get your own, YOUR OWN, ya heard?

Niggas wanna fuck my wife, niggas wanna take my life
But it's so haaaaaard

[Verse 2 - Big Punisher]
Rollin with the Squad, we like Gods
Catch us at the bar-de-bar-de-bars
Strip bars in Miami, almost came home with the Grammy
Next year, bringing home three for the family
Watch me, you can catch it live on the Hitachi
Poppin shit like a Nazi, iced out like DeBiase
Fuck that, Liberace
Fo'-X Versace, somebody stop me!
Never that, SKEE-YU! Where my niggas at?
Uptown! Uptown! You know you feelin that
Cash Rule, hardcore you can dance to
That old Biggie give me, Onnne More Chaaaaance
Take a glance and I'm off with yours
With both hands take off my drawers
And jerk me like the Source Awards
I love hip-hop, I ain't even probably the best lyricist alive
Terror Squad nigga stop sleepin, ooh yeah

[Hook]

[Hook Adlibs 2: Big Punisher]
What you say your name was again
And I know you from where? Elementary school?
I don't know you MAN!
Money, not you again, go that way

Niggas wanna be like Pun, but they don't bust they guns
And it's so haaaaaard
Niggas wanna fuck my wife, niggas wanna take my life
But it's so haaaaaard

[Coda: Donell Jones]
Yeah, you ain't fucking my wife, takin' my life
And if you just hatin' just walk on by
All you haters just walk on by
See me and Big Pun be rolling
Schemin' on you and yo homie
Better just walk on by, while we role back and talk for a while
And to the Boricuas, stay up, stay up, stay up
And to all my homies, you gotta know what's up[Verse 1]
The harsh realities of life are taking toll
Even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me what price to pay to make it home
Take control, I'm making dough but not enough to blow
JO's they lust my flows, but 'ey yo I don't trust a soul
That's all I know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you
Halfway and eat you alive trying to survive illegal
I'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross, whip you like a horse
Sacrifice your life to a higher force
Then I'll stomp your corpse
It's the Bronx of course recognize the accent
One of the last living still in action general assassins
Catching any wreck, blasting any tech, smashing any chest
Passing any test — Charles Manson in the flesh
Any last requests before you meet your maker
Sow what you reap or wake up, shaking up a storm like Anita Baker
I'll take you straight to hell and fill your heart with hate
Incarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake then I lock the gate
Make no mistake this shit as real as Joe, we follow the killer's code
When we come for you tell me, where will you go
Nowhere to run, hide, I'll find you and and silence your screams
And even if you kill me I'll still be in your fucking dreams

[Hook]
You ain't a killer, you still learning how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat

[Verse 2]
You've made a grave mistake
Shouldn't of come here, you changed your fate
Your brains'll make their debut on the table when I raise the stakes
The pain is great but only for a second, it starts strong then lessens
Just when you resting, the Armaggedon sets in
Left him with so much stress (T.S.), blessed him with no regrets, yes
Welcome to Hell, son — the threshold of death
Face the serpent, I blaze your person, you get laced for certain
Leaving Jakes no trace to work from - close the case like curtains
I'm hurting head severely really trying to bring the pain
There's nothing more satisfying than when you crying, screaming my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods of bloodstains
Big Pun's my thug's name, busting my guns, that's my love thang
I'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple
John Madden-tackle your corpse to hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body til it burst
Then curse tu vida, like a Brujería verse
I'm worse than anything you ever been through, sick in the head and mental
Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Faking like you Satan, when I'm the rhyming abomination

[Hook]
You ain't a killer, you still learning how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learning how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat

[Verse 3]
It's hard to analyze which guys are spies— be advised, people
We recognize who lies— it's all in the eyes, chico
We read em and see em for what they are
D's in undercover cars, taking my picture like I'm a fucking star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
With half a million in the stash
Passport with the gats, first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini-shottie, I body a nigga for a penny probably
I'm obligated to anything if it's crime related
If it shine I'll take it, still in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last edition, properly a stash magician
Could've went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game, now I'm strictly out for CREAM
Doing things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream
My team's the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the heaven's kings, down to the devil's mezzanine
I've never screamed so loud, I'm proud to be alive
Most heads die by twenty-five or catch a quick three-to-five
So be advised: the street's full of surprises
It's not what crew's the livest
One that survive, it's who's the wisest

[Hook]
You ain't a killer, you still learning how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learning how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer[Hook: sample]
I gave you fair warning, beware
I gave you fair warning, beware

[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
What you thought punk? Shit was sweet now you can't sleep
Gotta keep your eyes open wide and hide your face from the streets
I'm like the beast with a warrant, far from a law man
Gave you fair warning, now you on the stairs falling
I'm calling out any rapper that I doubt, smack em in the mouth
Throw em in the yoke. Boom! Then I knock em out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files
Twenty-shot auto Glock, blaow Benny Blanc Puerto Rock style
With a twist of black and I'm proud, twist your cap and I'm out
Sleep with the fish-dips for yapping too loud
What's happening now, niggas is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Picking on the smallest victim gives them heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down the hardest regardless
Besides of the largest we polish the floor with the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory and niggas can't do shit to me
Physically, lyrically, hypothetically, realistically
I'm the epitome of catching wreck, catch you when you cash your cheque
Smash you when you pass then jack you for your fucking Lex
Nothing less than the best if the Squad did it
Hard-headed niggas better beware and fear like God said it

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
Aiyo, I warned you, now all niggas could do is mourn you
I'm born to kill and still thrilled, I put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse only results in loneliness
Only the strong survive and strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us kill, even massacre
Who wanna try, Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and Hell's your next stop
For real my shit's cocked, the world has just stopped
I'm not the one you should be underestimating
Come test your fate and I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe
You never know, however though, I still hold the title
When all my rivals have chance to dance with Mr. Homicidal
Hand on the Bible, I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakening
My crew's basically waiting patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you, Terror Squad's everywhere like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody, who are we
The foundation, you're facing a whole army

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Fat Joe]
Yeah yeah yeah, what's up now, partner?
Know I'm saying? Think this just some rap shit?
We do this shit for real
Terror Squad nigga
Fucking shoot the place up
Motherfucker know the time
This motherfucking rap game
Joe Crack, Big Dog Punisher, Full-A-Clips crew
The fuck, what, beware, beware, beware[Verse 1: Triple Seis]
I'll battle you all, from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis: the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed by my Squad
It's odd y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rocking the Lo sweaters
The ones who paid with their life
I rock for 40 days and 40 nights
And every verse is tight
Better than before, rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain
I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Nawmean, do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail, blazin' like Rasheed Wallace
What's today's knowledge, hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money, son: that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low trying to blow trees
And for no reas', we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missing link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
We brave in the heart, playing a part, amazingly smart
Razor-sharp, futuristic raps: state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars, first it was Nasty Nas
Now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low: business, never personal
Just some words to know - if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him, now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state, If death is my fate, then cool I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny, it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker
That bent me right next to me
Aight crew
Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, coming with the thunder and the lightnin'
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, sniping your moms, right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm, it's the ghetto God
I rip a nigga's heart out his frame
While I scream" "Terror Squad"
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she'd starve on a diet, instead I'm a God in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzling beer bottles by the dozen
With Devin: that's mi hermano

[Refrain]
We will be here, forever - KRS
We brave in the heart, p-p-p-playin a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun, that's the ghetto God

[Verse 3: Prospect]
You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce theyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a .9 steady
I'm John Blazin when you see the arms razin'
Shit, crime heavy already
I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers: how you more ready? And switch bigger
And more berry: I'm a cherry, you a strawberry
If you lost that, mean I'm on top of the whip
You plotting to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose, I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Make way for scrill'; I don't play, I spray for real
Blow your top with the Glock: that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like 30 shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast cause the thieves is close
Want to keep your post? Then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out
That's like saying Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first. Terror Squad: shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the earth
I'm, dressed to kill, my niggas rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for running your lips
The street's a trip; either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggas that's seeking to flip[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
Ay-yo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
That's the mathematical madness I'm on, the savage, the strong
The marriage, a bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on as if Picasso laced you
There's lotsa hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school, that's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Cable, slashing your facial
That's how a master degrades you
I'm battling Jesus if he passes through my label
I'm snatching his halo
God I'll trade you if send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizing
I'm only emphasizing
I'm still all about business and enterprising
I'm super lyrical, a brain boosts the chemicals
That's used up tentacles inside of my mental projectable

[Hook]
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm, I'm supposed to represent

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Black Thought the super lyricist, your arch-nemesis
Still with the Punisher, that's my accomplice
Stressing to emcees how they don't really want this
Electrifying shit his excellency Thought spit
These cats they sentimental such with a gentle touch
Dancing double dutch and all saying nothing much
My sound wave lifting your chin up like uppercuts
New found ways of ripping shit up, I de-ve-lop
Your squad chest swell up, still you're mini-ay-ture to me
Nature-ally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplating where the world traveler been since
The Roots bless you with a strong record, long like a epic
Immerse you in some 'ol next shit, ill poetic
Thought from Illadelph
Somethin' like nothing else
My talk stomp like elephants upon every elf, cause what

[Hook]
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
You will lose, I must break you
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm-I'm-I'm
I'm supposed to represent

[Verse 3: Big Punisher]
Ay-yo peace Roots east coast niggas repping the streets most
With heat, toast, and keep close more Phillies than Pete Rose
These those, niggas that'll lift your mentals
Lyrics'll twist your temples into pretzels
Like the Triumph instrumental

[Verse 4: Black Thought]
My instrumental's the Renaissance, no resem-ba-lance
To nothing you come across, lyrical holocaust
The crowd pleaser emcees freeze then catch seizure
They praise the Lord of rap thesis, true believers

[Verse 5: Big Punisher]
Just call me Baby Jesus cause lately niggas be praising me
Just for the way I blaze the beat crazily, tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavery
Gaze into my rhymes that basically hypnotize you occasionally

[Verse 6: Black Thought]
Occasionally as I focus on my next opus
The way it's all fucked up and emcees is hopeless
I leave your head wrecked as I erect sculptures
My thought's just a fortress, approach this ferocious up-closeness

[Hook]
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm-I'm-I'm I'm supposed to represent
Lyrically...It's suicide
Lyrically...You've seen him, you know how strong he is
Lyrically...You can't win
Lyrically...It's suicide
Lyrically...You've seen him, you know how strong he is
Lyrically...You can't win
Lyrically...You can't win
Lyrically...You will lose
Lyrically...I must break you
Ly-ly-ly-lyrically[Tony Sunshine]
Ooooooooooohhhhh.. Puerto Rico

[Big Punisher]
Toma

[Hook: Tony Sunshine]
Pronto llegara, el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top

[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
Puerto Rock Puro, not Menudo no I'm not the one
I'm studyin' Judo, you don't know if I got a gun
It's Pun, from the X side of things, baguette inside my rings
Everything I want I gets, bada-BING
It's mine I Shyne like money that sound like Biggie
Fuck around my town, Boogie Down my city
Come around get pound, to the ground no pity
Watch the sound, fo'-pound twenty round milli'
Get smacked silly, for coming out your mug
I'm known for bouncin' thugs from the Tunnel to the Salsa clubs
Don't matter, put the chrome to your bladder
Splatter your abs, have you pissin' in a plastic bag
That's a drag now you abnormal
Don't make me go out to rumble
And put some motherfuckin' stabs on you
The night is young and I'm already fightin', hidin' my gun
Promoter buggin' screamin', who the fuck invited Pun

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
From San Juan to Bayamon, I'm the Don Juan beside the Don
Live long, get your party on
Don't let the liquor fool you, cause I'll stick it to you
Somethin sharp to the heart, or somethin big to move you
The Desert or the shottie, whatever you the body
That chose to be the dumb nigga at the party
Too much Bacardi started speakin' dumb
Then you tried to snuff Joe, must have been Puerto Rican rum
That's the hardcore, two years a sophomore
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
So get lost or take one, bones I break them
Pigs are bacon, so get fried if they come
You see that? I'm like G. Rap, 'Pac, Master P
All balled up with a twist of Marc Anthony
Recognize me I'm the one that's cockin' the auto
Tony Sunshine please canten el coro

[Hook]

[Tony] It ain't over
[Pun] I thought you ain't like the beat
[Tony] Te digo que no se ha acabado

[Tony Sunshine]
La tierra del Borinquen donde nacido yo
Aha aha aha aha..
Es un jardin florido de magico primor
Aha aha aha aha aha aha aha...
Un cielo siempre nitido, que sirve de dosel
Y dan arrullos placidos, las olas a sus pies

[Hook]

[Frankie Cutlass sample x4]
A Puerto Rico[Intro]
N.O.R.E the movie coming soon
Timbaland, shut the fuck up
Tryna be out in '98, you know
I'm tryna watch this movie, this the real shit
Shut the fuck up, '98, it's ours

[Verse 1: Nature]
Regardless of rain or snow, sleet or hail
I kick street tales, choking niggas like I'm Sprewell
Golden State, holding your fate in the palm of my hand
Blow you away like it's part of the plan
I gotta call it like I see it, talk it like I be it
Walking my walk, thugged out orthopedic
Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up
Niggas try to stick me like Abdul Louima
Follow the leader, make me go extra hard
Yo N.O.R.E. should I hold back or show the repertoire
Quit at sixteen or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers
I show them why it's so hard to reach us
I get pussy with my father's features, puff heavily
See me at 6'1", weigh a buck 70
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be
Packed in like Green Bay, Harlem week to Queens day
Performing acapella, no DJ
'98 Live, no replays, make it seem easy
So tell a friend to tell a friend
That it's them again, Nature, Noreaga, wild gremlins

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
Champagne on the rocks, sporting a Fort Knox Lazarus
Shark salad with carrots, pork chops and applesauce
Twin connection, disrespect watch your body cave in
Pump the shotty guaging, hit the shorty while he potty training
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst
You'll be the first to get his whole body fully reversed
Uzi ya hearse, leave you double-dead, I'm a bubble-head
I never listen to nothing my mother said
I hold niggas ransom for money like Johnny Handsome
Been soning niggas for so long, I think I got a grandson
My passion is money, a stash and a honey
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody
That's my kind of girl, kind of world I want to live in
Not a cell or a prison or in Hell's Armageddon
Just a little ghetto where my niggas control the middle
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Been in rich places, sick places
Seen my story, 6,666 pages
Wages, I rolled six aces and at the same dice games
I caught six cases, all over big faces
Now it's tipped laces, ready to dig faces
But the banger ain't a bit spacious
Niggas loading up their rib cages, cats to rent rib places
Bloody lip taste it, but Cam is a big racist
But I stay in import the pig places
But the world know the girl though, I fuck her off a furlough
She'll be up, hook me up, all your sales could be luck
Only question for these ducks is, "Baby girl could we fuck?"
You the type that need a wife
Thought L-O-X told y'all the key to life, asshole
Yo I don't play around, I lay it down, fuck around, I spray a round
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it, my ass you can kick or kiss it

[Verse 4: Jadakiss (Styles P)]
Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this
Bust off and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips
Like two thirds of a brick, (Paniero) and 'Kiss
The kiss the crystal white fluffy part that'll (come back quick
(See the plan is to stash all) and cash y'all
(The weed so strong), they gotta put it glass jars
Niggas try to smoke me out the (moke me out)
Cause the rims on my new joint be poking out
(I'm about to have no feelings, shit is deep)
Do they dance with the Devil when they sleep
(I wake up gripping the air, wishing to hear)
Shit that they kick in your ear when your soul drift in the air
(My gift is half-rotten when I'm spitting some tears
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry)
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die
(They say you get what you ask for) So get it cause you asked for it
(If a nigga ain't a thief) then he better have the cash for it
(And we gonna be around till ya body rot)
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got nigga

[Verse 5: Noreaga]
There's two ways into the hood, one plain
The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain
Let's get loose, Hennessy straight with tomato juice
Queens stallion, my guns, fully Italian
Now y'all niggas recognize medallions
I play the best hood, O-T with Tim Westwood
Used to be on Section 8, now my section is good
Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could
And I don't give a fuck what, yo I save my shit
And I don't give a fuck what, you can save your shit
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Listen to Bob Marley, y'all funny niggas like Steve Harvey
Fronting live with a weak army
I play the nice guy too and even smoke with you
But the realness, I ain't got no love for you
That's why I never do a song with you
Not even if your baby moms fucked the crew
And promised to give us head and swallow too
I still say low, no is no, no can do
Ya niggas drinking Haterade, drinking my flow

[Outro: Noreaga]
Yo, thug shit thug shit what what
What the fuck is the deal, thugged out entertainment
Untertainment
L-o-x, Terror Squad, this shit is fuckin' official[Intro]
We over here
Its the wild life...you heard?
Yo...yo Pun set it off yo

[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
I'll put the muthafuckin' blows like a pro supposed to
And hold a loaded toe for all the pistol smokers now initialed on my shoulder holster
You know the culture when its East Coast we run the streets most
Who want beef, turn your peeps into meatloaf
You know the steez, when its murderin' third degrees
We observe the breathe, and move with the wind like birds and bees
Word to Jeez, Christ I'm nice, go ahead roll the dice
You know the price, your kid and your crib like the poltergeist
I'm cold as ice, control your life with the mic
And then take your crown and break you down like liquid nitrogen
Invite your men, I'll strike your chin while you're rapping
I'll get on some Brooklyn shit, grab my clip and start clappin'
Make your heart flatten, stop acting retarded
All you flea hearted villains know you building off what we started
The streets are guarded heavily, where the violence doubles
Forty fives and shovels ready in the five livest boroughs

[Hook] x4
I keep tellin' ya'll (Be on your best behavior)
When I come through (Be on your best behavior)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Yo be on your best quietest kept
Boy Ima fire this Tec
Blow holes through ya dome just for lying on ya rep
I'm sick and tired of the threats
To say the least, my niggas play for keeps
Cut the middle finger off your favorite niece
Blaze your peeps just for talkin' shit
So unfortunate you had to come across this clique
We been doin' this for years, ruinin' the fierce (kids)
Niggas never want to listen to the toolies in the ear
Feel the fear when you fuckin' with the Bronx finest
We old timers, get snatched and catch a case of Alzheimer's
These small timers be really thinkin' that we be sleepin
'Till they find 'em leakin' on the side of the Major Deegan
I hate to cease it but I gotta do it
For no reason spill your body fluid when my bullets travel through it
You down to do it, then stop frontin' the cops comin'
Ya'll niggas some bitches that never shot nothin'!

[Hook] x4
I keep tellin' ya'll (Be on your best behavior)
When I come through (Be on your best behavior)[Fat Joe]
Blam!
Bang bang baby!
Yeah, Terror Squad style
Trizzie, check it out now

[Cuban Link]
Yo, I'm rated X in sex, I flex like Lex Luger
So who's next to get scooped up by this roughneck from Cuba?
We do maneuvers like Super Dave, always with a group of babes
Laying mami's out like Sugar Ray
Cause Cuban Link don't play miss, I flip and do some strange [shit]
Witchu like hit you with the whips and chains, check it
I get you naked like I'm mystic, cause this [dick] is
Thick as a brick, raw with big [balls] that bend it
Now let's get, physical, my jiggable pie
Let this lyrical guy scuba dive right between your thighs
I satisfy like a Snickers bar cause I'm the bigger bar
That'll stick you quicker than a 'spic will strip a car
My repoitoire holds a four star performance with all women
Hittin more skins than Alec Baldwin
You're fallin in love and you can't get up
Now check the cut, I stripped ya, now you can't strut, word up

Chorus: Big Pun

Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Chorus

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, uh, yo
Paradin in the Palladium, all eyes on my presence
Poppin the Crist', sportin the chick straight out of Essence
Word up, patch thug, three quarter front Polo jiggy
Be like 'Who is he, lookin like a grizzly?'
While your girl watch me, you're busy drink pissy
Wanna lay your love, but your love wanna kiss me, huh
I got a fly team, me and my guys gleam like high beams
Makin the killin off of fiends with pipe dreams
It might seem, like I'm conceited with the C.R.E.A.M. talk
But I got the kind of green that could bribe a Supreme Court
And when we talk, the whole world listen
Turn your back to T.S. for one second and find your girl missin

[Big Pun]
Baby make me holla, take it off, I give you dolla
We can party til manana ain't nobody gotta know nada
Word to Allah, give me some Mississippi massana
I'll be in the sauna, chupin' the nalga like the chupacabra
Cool it mama, you gettin too hot, bust a shot
Boo-yaa! Rub it up and down like my oo-wops
Sucia!, show me your dirty dance
The way you work the pants make any man wanna jerk his gnads

Chorus

[Cuban Link]
Yo, my [shit's] official like it in you like, Keith Murray
Bury my beef, gettin your sweet cherry every week if necessary
I'm very nasty like Nas, did you ask me?
Pass me those [ass]cheeks and I'll bring you joy like BlackSTREET
In the backseat of my Jeep, we can chill
Or Creep like TLC but don't sleep, I keep it real
What the deal mami, you wanna feel on my steel salami?
Come and try me, I'll sign my name all over your punani

[Triple Seis]
Ohh mami, you comin home with me
All night in my tub drinkin Hennessey
Gettin lyed up with your thighs up, I'mma surprise her
When I rise up, inside her
Yippie kay yay, I'mma ride her, and guide her
Straight to the triz, where we goin, straight to the crib
Pun in here and Cuban and Seis, you know what time it is
Soon as we walk in the crib, let's get biz

TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ (oahkayyy!)

Chorus: Big Pun

Since ya man can't do it like Link (like Link?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Seis (like Seis?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Crack (like Crack?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Pun (like Pun?)
I make you scream papa (you the best bana!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Link (like Link?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Seis (like Seis?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Crack (like Crack?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Pun (like Pun?)
I make you scream papa -- adios mama![Hook: sample]
I gave you fair warning, beware
I gave you fair warning, beware

[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
What you thought punk? Shit was sweet now you can't sleep
Gotta keep your eyes open wide and hide your face from the streets
I'm like the beast with a warrant, far from a law man
Gave you fair warning, now you on the stairs falling
I'm calling out any rapper that I doubt, smack em in the mouth
Throw em in the yoke. Boom! Then I knock em out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files
Twenty-shot auto Glock, blaow Benny Blanc Puerto Rock style
With a twist of black and I'm proud, twist your cap and I'm out
Sleep with the fish-dips for yapping too loud
What's happening now, niggas is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Picking on the smallest victim gives them heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down the hardest regardless
Besides of the largest we polish the floor with the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory and niggas can't do shit to me
Physically, lyrically, hypothetically, realistically
I'm the epitome of catching wreck, catch you when you cash your cheque
Smash you when you pass then jack you for your fucking Lex
Nothing less than the best if the Squad did it
Hard-headed niggas better beware and fear like God said it

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
Aiyo, I warned you, now all niggas could do is mourn you
I'm born to kill and still thrilled, I put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse only results in loneliness
Only the strong survive and strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us kill, even massacre
Who wanna try, Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and Hell's your next stop
For real my shit's cocked, the world has just stopped
I'm not the one you should be underestimating
Come test your fate and I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe
You never know, however though, I still hold the title
When all my rivals have chance to dance with Mr. Homicidal
Hand on the Bible, I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakening
My crew's basically waiting patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you, Terror Squad's everywhere like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody, who are we
The foundation, you're facing a whole army

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Fat Joe]
Yeah yeah yeah, what's up now, partner?
Know I'm saying? Think this just some rap shit?
We do this shit for real
Terror Squad nigga
Fucking shoot the place up
Motherfucker know the time
This motherfucking rap game
Joe Crack, Big Dog Punisher, Full-A-Clips crew
The fuck, what, beware, beware, beware[Verse 1]
Niggas is flossing a lot, time to start extorting the block
It's a portion of prod' off the top for my Porsche and my yacht
Something for the cops to keep em blind, so we can grind
With peace of mind, turn the key and shine without being dimed
Time to expand, New York to Chicago, Colorado
You know my motto, clock G's and rock keys like Drago
Pablo Escobar and Dom Perignon
We're buying out the bar and Don Juanin' and every woman's Chandonin'
Long donging em down like Sean Michaels does 'em
I'm like a pyscho
Fucking sucking the butt like liposuction
Up and down with the tongue twister, c'mon on sister
Big Pun's Mr. "cock and squeeze" like a gun tester
Crushing sister's backs with the demon snap, hit you from the back
Close your eyes relax, let me feed the cat
Living fat, true mack, niggas was catching feelings
Dealing with a smaller deck it just wasn't as mass appealing
I started feeling funny, niggas coming short with money
I called my son he told me chill he'd be over in twenty
Punny what's the deal, niggas wanna kill me
He said it's real, they jealous and tired of seeing me Willie silly
Had more to claim, niggas throwing shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches running the train
It's like a dream, I called my team and started flipping
Lock the clip in started lifting niggas off the ground like a magician
I skipped town, be back around when things quiet down
I lost it all for now but it'll take more to hold me down

"Top of the world ma! Ha ha, top of the world!"

[Hook]
Yo, this is the bad time - boomerang, bring it all back
Flashback, live and prosper, eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula, popular to the masses
I miss the E-Classes, rocking game with def glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis
Boomerang - plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First you shine like sterling, then you broke like brick in Berlin

[Verse 2]
Now should I slit my wrists, go for it all or call it quits
Picture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back, and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record and respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedys, above the law, fuck em all
I'm coming for the rich thieving em even if I wasn't poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and be the primary source
Of course, I bury any adversary trying to floss
Just because, the reason I leave em lost in the sauce
Teeing off like we up North just for being soft
A beaten horse like a slave getting minimum wage
Feeling the gauge, front page, these are the last days
Cash pays, and rules - the root of all evil
Shooting amigos for loot and perico polluting our people
Moving kilos like it's all good through every ghetto
I ain't judging, but bugging how we fall so many levels
The devil's got us by the balls, that's why the law allows
The drugs to overflood, knowing we gonna buy it all
It's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter
And priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water
I'm gonna get mine, either from crime, or through the Bible
Whichever way, it better pay, I'm feeling suicidal

[Hook][Verse 1: Triple Seis]
I'll battle you all, from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis: the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed by my Squad
It's odd y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rocking the Lo sweaters
The ones who paid with their life
I rock for 40 days and 40 nights
And every verse is tight
Better than before, rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain
I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Nawmean, do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail, blazin' like Rasheed Wallace
What's today's knowledge, hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money, son: that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low trying to blow trees
And for no reas', we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missing link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
We brave in the heart, playing a part, amazingly smart
Razor-sharp, futuristic raps: state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars, first it was Nasty Nas
Now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low: business, never personal
Just some words to know - if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him, now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state, If death is my fate, then cool I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny, it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker
That bent me right next to me
Aight crew
Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, coming with the thunder and the lightnin'
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, sniping your moms, right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm, it's the ghetto God
I rip a nigga's heart out his frame
While I scream" "Terror Squad"
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she'd starve on a diet, instead I'm a God in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzling beer bottles by the dozen
With Devin: that's mi hermano

[Refrain]
We will be here, forever - KRS
We brave in the heart, p-p-p-playin a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun, that's the ghetto God

[Verse 3: Prospect]
You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce theyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a .9 steady
I'm John Blazin when you see the arms razin'
Shit, crime heavy already
I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers: how you more ready? And switch bigger
And more berry: I'm a cherry, you a strawberry
If you lost that, mean I'm on top of the whip
You plotting to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose, I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Make way for scrill'; I don't play, I spray for real
Blow your top with the Glock: that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like 30 shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast cause the thieves is close
Want to keep your post? Then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out
That's like saying Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first. Terror Squad: shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the earth
I'm, dressed to kill, my niggas rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for running your lips
The street's a trip; either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggas that's seeking to flipYeah
This is clasic shit right here, vintage shit
Go get ya tape decks ready uh
You know I had to bring 'em back hahahaha
Terror era's the squad man
Yeah uh yo uh yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Aye yo I'm old school like Rick Ruler sick jewels to big buddah
Lift dudes wit the six shooter Luger (Ooh Yeeah)
That means bring it back NY king of that
The best tried a dead mind but just can't see to that
The 4th comin don't look now theres more comin
And we all stunnaz wit lil money but still hungry
True story once threw a nigga from a two story
Asked for my paper said theres nothin he can do for me
Thats like takin a steak out of a lions mouth
Betta yet that like takin a plate outta Ryans mouth
Thatll neva happen ova my dead body
Feds got me plastered on the wall like I'm the heir to Gotti
I swear to Mambo and Nore and all the left wreck
A nigga try front on his body he gettin sent back
Dont resent Crack I'm just what you wanna be
Young rich and famous bitches can't get enough of me
And they runnin up on me usually in groups of them
But not just everyday but you could neva be too use to them
I be abusin them squeezin fresh oranges
Breakfast in the mornin get some strength and then it's on again

[Hook: Fat Joe, Big L, & Big Pun]
I just had to bring 'em back
(Word you definitely know what I'm about)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
(All my friends call me stout)
I just had to bring 'em back
(Flamboyant baby)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

[Verse 2: Big L]
When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about 5-0
A hard core life I toast to ex flaw
Therefore I live raw and went to war wit the law
My only picture was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot
Get swellin hops from sellin tops to da drugs spot
G's was clocked fat knots was in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight
Cause we put the guns down and go one round
Wit the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style, cause I'm versatile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin worse than foul
I pack two techs in case ya crew flex
I wet up the set in a second yell whos next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like Shaft
Turn ya staff into a blood bath to laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you softer than jelly jack
I attack in black wit a gat and a skully hat

[Hook]
I just had to bring 'em back
(All my friends call me stout)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
(Flamboyant baby)
I just had to bring 'em back
(Terror Squad cause we stunt)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

[Verse 3: Big Pun]
No doubt I'm from the X and I seen it all
Shorties wit dreams of playin ball for Seton Hall turnin fiends a full
From Meda ward to Sacuon the same sad song
Is bein sung, its like gimmie a gun and I'm back on
Joey Crack, Pun, TS, Bronx regulators
Stomp little niggas to death for tryin to imitate us
Yall could neva see us, be us, TS, kill da bs
Cause Pun got more guns and funds than Undeas
Un be us, I'm from the BX so I have to roll
Blast the 4 crash ya door smash ya ho
Hack off ya skull, I'm stackin heads like totem poles
Blow a hole in ya colon throw you from here to Fordan road
Blow fa blow, I toe to toe with the toughest
Bring the ruckas to the roughest muthafucka its nothin but luckstress
My crews are cussin to bustin ass crushin glass
In niggas faces leavin traces of red out this bloody bath
I want the cash off the jiddump, I cock and blast the piddump
At any piddunk tryin to laugh at the Briddonx
You ain't no kiddon for the Terror Squadron
You feel the fear of God when I steal a car and flatten ya Pierre Cardan
I peirce ya noggin if you startin trouble, spark the dot above you
And watch it blossom like a flower throughout the borough
No doubt I'm thorough with a parascope rifle extended rycle
Cycle thatll tear the whole Bible out
I'm sweatin no idols a title's all I request
Best rappers know that Pun and Y the chaperones of death..

[Hook]
I just had to bring 'em back
(Word you definitly know what I'm about)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
(All my friends call me stout)
I just had to bring 'em back
(Flamboyant baby)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo(verse1)
Why you rhymin like you killin' niggas
You ain't never feel a trigga
Screamin that you real but y'all still beginners
I make examples out you ample rappers
Smack you make you trample backwards
Catch you fallin' flat than strap you back in pampers
That's a sample just to let you know
Test me and invest in souls
Specially on some flesh meat, never left on skulls
No supposin' holding grudges you'll be holdin crutches
Motherfuckers blastin' me that's blasphamy, I'm old to roughage
Who's the toughest as rough as they come
I'll snuff 'em anyone of ya bluffin'
My name ain't Punisher for nothing
Keep huffin' and puffin', I blow your face in
When me and Seis and my ace in the hole lyrical assassin be Triple Seis and
Chasing popo outta puerto town
Loco til I part the ground
In my coffin, tossed in, to the lost and found
Down and deep beneath the weather in my leather jae
Six feet forever, half asleep Bronx niggas never die[Big Pun]
It's mine; it's all mine you understand
At least me and my peoples
Can you dig that
21st century, thought I'd never see it
Right around the corner, baby
Ours for the takin'

[Verse one: Big Pun]
I've seen child blossom to man
Some withered and turned to murderers
Led astray by the liars death glorifiers observin' us
Watching us close, marking our toast ???
Purposely overtaxin' the earnings
Nervous, burnin' down the churches
They're scared of us, rather beware than dare to trust
Always in jail, million dollar bail, left there to rust
Let's call in order, give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
Advance to where minorities are the majority voter
Holdin' my own, I'm livin' alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan, you go girl
She's an exception, some people can leap to the impression
See, me myself, I start flippin' and fall victim to deep depression
I'm stressin' the issue here, so we can gross the fiscal year
Tired of gettin fired and hired as a pistol-eer
There's no longevity livin' off negativity
Fuck it, I'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
That's how the city be, everybody gettin' they hustle on
Judge singin' death penalty like it's his favorite fuckin' song
Word is bond, takin' my life you know they lovin' it
God, F the government and it's fuckin' capital punishment

[Hook: Prospect]
Capital punishment, given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin' with
Can't live alone, watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin' the llello for life, the rightful heir to the throne
We come from Kings and Queens, people with dreams, Gods and Earths
For what it's worth, we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First it's turnin tables, open our own labels
Disable the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment

[Verse Two: Big Pun]
I've seen it all up close, shit out the movies you'd be buggin'
My cousin Chuchi, barely a juve', lost it and turned on the oven
He wasn't playin', blew out the flame and started inhalin'
Baring a secret too deep to keep on the street for sharin'
Wearin' the virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency
Dishin' his dick in every thick promiscuous fish in the sea
Listen to me, shit is rough in the ghetto
You bluff, blow your head off, fuck a snuff, we bust lead off
Get off your high horse, or die off like an extinction
Boriquans are like Mohicans, The Last of the Po'Ricans
We need some unity, fuck all the jeeps and jewelry
The maturity, keeps me six feet, above obscurity
The streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado
I guess the motto we promise to let you homage in death your motto
Like Zorro, I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z, but a P, cause Punishment's what I resemble
I lend you this if it expands yours, for you and yours
A real man can't fall, he stands tall
The Man's claws are diggin in my back, I'm tryin to hit him back
Time to counteract, where my niggas at

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Prospect]
You like that, it's Pun and Prospect
We hold nines, own more treasure than gold mines, makin progress
With Don Juan's, there's rules to be made, crews to be sprayed
Dues to be paid, nothin' y'all can do to behave
We laid in the slums, made a cake out of crumbs
Even though the government, tryin to take out our sons
Rudy Gulliani trying to blind me, but I see reality
Was raised with the street mentallity
My strategy's why my battery never die
The ghetto kept me wise, so I would never fall to the lies
It's no surprise, but do or die if you want the glamour
Yeah, I want the glamour, laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta
While Cuban's smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas
The hammer in the palm, never shaky, calm handlers
This renegade blow through barricades like grenades
I turn the sun to shade, then the night back to day
Like the twenty-four hour rotation
I know the location, it's just a little in-for-mation
From the Squad, bringing the Terror for the nine-era
And let it rain on your fine leather, nigga, what[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Wanna rumble with Pun, huh
*blows raspberry* Shit on the whole industry
Who puff more Owls than Pun? Pile on more styles than Pun?
Who the only one with over a thousand guns?
Running up in niggas cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the firestarter
Hit your wife with the sawed off in the shower, powers I've gotta
I'm all about the fundamentals, like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper, a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mental's compatible with the radicals
My oddessey type, qualities allow me to poli' with animals
Niggas is cannibals and the ghetto's a jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles or struggle on the simple and humble
My niggas'll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran'
Try to imagine what they can sacrifice for twenty grand
Niggas'll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
We pound out weak shit into the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down we just wallow in jean, pile on the green
Surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
For now I'm a King, so it's more than money, all the honies
Used to call me Punny cause my fam was always hungry
But now we rolling lovely and you feel worse, want my money, let your steel burst
Cause I'd rather see you in Hell first

[Hook: Wyclef and Pun]
Mucho trabajo poquito dinero
I'm selling perrico
What's the deally yo
I'm Uptown making moves just like Castro

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Keep the lights keep the camera all I want is the action
The battle's on, where I roam in composition
A hardcore crowd, waiting to see if I break
Like your first time in jail when you got fucked by an inmate
It'll never happen, I'm on balance like a Libra
And if I get murdered, Don't Cry For Me Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka, bury me next to my father
In three days, I'll rise like Christ and still sober
Now my eyes open in my hands I got the Gatling
I'm looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
I turn Mr. Roger's Neighborhood topsy turvy
Foes and enemies meaning the same in the dictionary
This ain't Pictionary, all you see is the cemetary
Bodies from World War I and II is there
You don't want a Third war, that's nuclear warfare
So Big Pun, count the stacks, make it fast
Illegal money turns legal now we runnin a laundromat
Your hunchbacked and whack rap is packed in your backpack
Your better off in D.C. with the mayor smoking crack
This ain't a diss, Wyclef bomb threat
Run out of the building or get blast in your Guess
Tec for Tec or we can go text for text, oh
I forgot, you don't read so take this hole in your chest - blaow
Hide the blood, give you the gun, run and hide
So when the DT shows up, he thought it was a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide

[Hook][Intro]

You know, it seems to me that everyone is concerned with way it is
And they say that everyone cheats
Well here's a question
If you cheat, don't you think that she will?

[Chorus 1 - Tony Sunshine]
Cheat on her
Or she's gonna cheat on you
But she does it classy
At a hot little spot
At some rendez-vous (rendez-vous)
Cheat on her
Even though she's gonna cheat on you
'Cos she does it nasty with your best friend
And your brother too

[Verse 1 - Cuban Link]
Yo, ay yo, excuses excuses
I'm sick of this bullshit it's useless
You're ruthless, you accused of me cheating
But where's your proof miss?
The truth is, you be flipping too much with those loose lips
Is it because I got the chicks feeling my music?
If the shoe fits, wear it
Yo you be thinkin' I'm stupid
Acting like you don't do shit, I studied ya movements
And you've been too slick since they first introduced us
Your used to being up in clubs dancing to lewd shit
You should think before you speak
Trying to blame it all on me
Eager to beef so you can leave and have a cheap excuse to cheat
See I know the game baby, you've been acting strange lately
A little deranged, you changed, you ain't the same lady
Playing me shady, claiming that I'm running trains daily
Saying you hate me maybe it's the fame that's making you crazy
Maybe it's me and just the way that I see it
Better believe it, if I never got caught I never cheated
Keep it real even the sweetest girls be cheating at will
Then you see 'em chillin' like if they don't be feelin' no guilt
Willin' to deal with it, givin' you that devious grill
'Cos she feels you did it so she's getting even to heal
I know the deal

[Chorus 2]
Cheat on her
Or she's gonna cheat on you
Cos she does it classy
At her friends [?] house, comment allez-vous
Cheat on her
Though shes gonna cheat on you
'Cos she does it nasty
Wiht the whole Terror Squad foundation crew

[Verse 2 - Big Pun]
Thought I was living low key
Official pimp daddy O.G
My whole steez was drinking beer and adultery
But don't sleep, a freak ain't always a mack
Then I found out my lil' sweet was blowin' out backs
She was lonely in track, started sipping Bacardi
Met some pimp at a party, now she stripping at Ardy's
Copped a whip and a Harley
Mad kick in the body, finally slipped at a hottie
With the politic of Anagi
Probably ran more trains than the third rail
Fuck it, it's her world, mind you this used to be a church girl
So it's my worst fear, jus knowing I'm responsible
When I sleep all I see is Mandingo throwing and King-Kongin' you
Can't rest, its like I'm hexed for life
How much respect you expect when niggas is sexing your wife
Professional advice, ignore the whores and the hooters
'Cos pains of the heart hurt much more than the bruises
More than a loser, 'cos I lost love in the fast lane
Next time I'll think twice before I give away my last name
Its mad strain, mad strife, mad stress but its a man's game
And your wife 'll be next

[Tony Sunshine]
I'm sorry (Baby I'm sorry)
Is all that I can say
I cheated, I didn't mean it
Baby I'm sorry

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][Big Pun]
No Doubt
Royal Flush Big Pun the fresh master
Niggas On the Run Eatin
We ain't no fuckin rappers
Peep this yo

[Big Pun]
Yo it's the Dream Shatterer
Strictly the green team battler
Ring rattler microphone fiend spleen splatterer
King in the throne bringing it home five nights
Up in the Source five mics Whipping the Porsche high price
Cuz I'm the word magician observe verbal technician
Spittin out words of wisdom in my preferred profession
Observe and listen learn ya lesson of a first impression
Or get served in seconds like I worked a kitchen
I heard you bitchin flippin the story liftin ya jewelries
Got my finger itchin but I heard ya position with Nore
We shut em down like Chuck fuck em for they greens
Suck em in like Biggie "Bang Bang have a nice dream"
My team ain't tryin to give off sad stories
All you do is flash jewelries
Really for the cash till my ass is buried
I flurry shots like jabs and stabbin in they cabbages ????
Throwin grenades in baby carriages
Fuck all the talking and lookin I'm walkin to ya block or coffin
Taught them to off him and sleep with the dolphins
Enforcing hostile takeovers with nozzles straightforward
Transportin in foreign camcorders in module Range Rover's

Chorus: Noreaga

If you thuggin and you know it clap your hands (What What)
Yo if you thuggin and you know it clap your hands (What What)
Yo if you thuggin and you know it and your really proud to show it
If you thuggin and you know it clap your hands (What What)

[Noreaga]
I used to stand on the block
And sellin cooked up rock
Money bustin out my sock
Plus I'm flashin my Glock
Yo i have brown skin and I live in Queens
I love eatin' chicken and cauligreens
Other boroughs try to front and fuck on me
But nigga Iraq my niggas like fuck off he
Yo you know that I damage you up hammer you up
Them niggas actin ill but they just ain't tough
And get that Bloody Money (What) and now the world know
I get that Bloody Money that's the only way to get dough
I alternated with the latest ya niggas hate it
Yo as long as niggas down dont really get faded
Ay yo I shoot like classical slugs
Niggas casual thugs shittin on the only niggas they love
Ay yo my niggas on the run still hold the fort
Do whatever that ya gotta do but don't get caught
You know the jakes don't even care about the cars we bought
We live expensively ???? come straight from Sicily
Colors that you ain't seen like black and green
You know dollars is my favorite thing ??????????

Chorus

[Royal Flush]
Ay yo Ay yo Ay yo
Yo I'm a straight thug show no love and get plugged
Grimy as fuck steel holder case i gotta buck
Stay lexed up chain reachin down to my nuts
Can't front on us from here to California we bust
The Lex pump it on in the back of the club sayin (What! What!)
Lay in the cut my niggas throwin dick to ya sluts
Park the car in the slums where I'm sellin my drugs
My uzi weigh a ton you too soft to fuck with us son
It's like the mafia fuck with La Familia then I'm poppin ya
Mega popular from this rap game philosopher
Lock it down like Nino Brown in my part of town
From the streets to the four pound see ya whole lay my mack down
I do it for my large niggas my broke niggas rob niggas
To my bum bitches tryin to stick star niggas
I wear Rolex flooded up with baguettes
Like Beenie Man "Who the keys to the Lex"
Read my bio on the internet listen on the ?????
For this Blood Money slash rap led to drug money
Royal Flush and Queens nigga fuck a crash dummy
I take time to earn mine while holdin my nine
Feel Me

Chorus

(beat till fade with sounds of an audience cheerin)* [Verse One] -- from the Show & A.G. "Full Scale EP"
* [Verse Two] -- from the DJ Clue CD "The Professional"

[Verse One]
Yo, my squad is honored like Elijah Muhammad
But I'm God-retarded, ain't no righteousness in this heart of violence
Hard as diamond but I'm in the ruff, listen up
If you ever see me with the Feds you can bet it's in the cuffs
Ain't no snitch in us, bitch in us
Unofficial-ness, everything we outside you wish you was
Official thugs in the drug profession
Drug connections, drug addictions
Still seein the judge for drug possession
The four-D's, all these is more reas'
To either get big, or leave and let live
We the best there is T.S., ain't nobody else
We probably Dove, cause we all way on top of the shelf
I'm lockin your wealth with the master keys, freeze
Don't try to breeze, or I'mma squeeze and blast the back of your knees
Just pass the cheese, please don't test the toaster
My tech'll roast ya body faster than Ferrari's Testarossa
You're gettin closer to death, Reaper's got a hold on your breath
You goin straight to hell as you sell your soul for your flesh
You was posin a threat, now you froze in the bed
Minute ago, you was poppin shit, holdin ya dick
Now what's the problem, you ain't nuttin like you said on your album
I thought you was wildin bustin your guns and runnin the island
You was't violent, you was silent tryin to get college credits
How pathetic, did it to get out of the calisthenics
I'm +Dianetics+ combined with lyrics
My matureness is my insurance
Kill my appearance, I'm a shinin spirit
You gotta fear it, cause every last gem is poison
You gotta cheer it, you can't win you better join em
I'm head-annointin niggas like the Holy Gospel
I'm the only vato loco to smoke you with fire-blowin nostrils
Watch for the toast, when you see it, you better draw yours
Warlords, callin The Giant, it's all yours

[Verse Two]
Fuck all y'all non-believers; I roll with God, the Squad and T.S
Out with the B.S. we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brain-bolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin it down, walkin around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin you down wit toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on the serious tip
You keep playin.. and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit, I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mac in back of the Ac[ura]
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that, but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mac, quicker than Kung Fu
With the reflexes of a cat, and the speed of a mongoose[Lord Tariq]
Yea, yea, one more time
Seventies shit, got the lean
Shit is leanin, it's to the left
It's just leanin, dribblin
Like he gave it a bag of dugy
Or a bag of that Tango and Cash
It's just leanin and shit, seventies (The Lord Tariq)

Aiyyo I been through many places
Done many things
Seen the eyes of many faces
From New York to Texas
To the faces on Rolexes
Not a racist or sexist
And the best is the Lord, none the less is Gunz
Nothin less than a Lexus
Bubble eye with V-V-S's
Trouble minds and troubled times
Stacks, I'm tryin to double mine
I'm in a six wit double dimes and a couple of nines
Me and tracks back to back, circle the block a couple of times
And we searchin for this nigga to try
I'm bubblin mine
If we don't get him now then we will in due time
I bust enough shots to kill him two times, I do crimes
I get caught then my mind's defendin my son's rhymes
Cause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time
I been through it under the influence
Bustin off I'm runnin into it
See me say he didn't do it
Put the nine to his mind and blew it
Cause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it
Puffin with my family, my bitch, my money or my music
Makin killas say he's too sick when he do shit
But I'm on some new shit, and it's too late the fuse lit
I treat my nine like a new bitch
And the shit do kick, word

[Hook: Lord Tariq]

[Fat Joe]
Play rap loud, politickin business
Wit the crack crowd, fact file, funny how I never seen a rat smile
My last trial's one of the reasons why I rap now
But still could blaow any nigga actin irrational
Fuckin with me's worse than duckin police
After puffin some trees I'll probably be abductin your niece
Murderin beats since the days of permanent crease
Been around the block seen grams converted to keys
Aah Cartagena, breaks hearts in Argentine
My misses slugs to love me, my wife act like Anita
Terror Squad'll die for the cause even if it means blowin up things
And takin over City Hall
My shit is raw straight from the Panama shores
If the feds can't catch me then they make up a law
Can't take it no more, niggas is fake to the core
My state pen friends'll leave you broke and naked up north
Bet it all on the Terror Squad click from Forrest
Real Bronx niggas that's heartless that spark shit
Regardless, niggas shouldn't have tried that shit
That's why mothafuckas gotta die like this

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I'm on the Cross Bronx with Gunz my man

On my head like a infrared he's dead, but I redeem
Now I'm back nigga, it's on nigga
Run nigga, Joe nigga, Pun nigga, Lord nigga
Gunz motherfuckers ain't really knowin I'm really goin
And feelin I'm showin that my main objective is Benz and Lexuses
Cop Rolexeses, get bigot in Texases
So fierce bitches they be callin me exorcist
Far from a devil, Im God I mean I'm Gunz
And I shine like sun, rhyme like none, find my gun
Got beef with this nigga with hits and shit
Chips and shit, run around here switchin shit
Tellin people don't play that, you gotta play this
Tellin crew you ain't sayin that, you gotta say this
You can't wear that, you gotta wear this
Well hear this, I'll go in yo chest and leave you earless, fearless
The only thing between us if you stop my cream
Is a Glock nineteen, and I'mma pop like steam
Tryin to stop me and mine from eatin you need a doctor
With a hundred gauze pads nigga to stop you from leakin
And a prayer from the deacon as you weaken
And words from the Funkmaster Flex dogs shouldn't have been reachin
There's only one Gunz, from what it's worth
That's me, that's it, buryin shit, right in the earth

[Hook: Peter Gunz]

And you nondescripters gonna have to face the consequences
We large placentas and you small change
Hittin niggas long range, wrong gauge
Leavin niggas John Blaze
Crime pays if you nice with yours
The Bronx is where you fight for yours
Ice your cross, slice cigars, light cigars
All day, wylin freestylin in the hallways
Broadway ain't got more drama than Watson off of Colgate
This ain't the old days shorties was bustin, ain't no fuckin jokin
Some nigga called me a German, I had to bust him open
My brothers holdin me down with heavy artillery
Chevies and Willies be chilin in front of every facility
Joey from Trinity so he reps Forrest
You could save the best for us
But you still better place your bets on us
The Bronx baby, where the best get blown
My restin zone, come on nigga test your throne
I'm blessed with chrome, so leave your vest at home
I don't aim for the chest bitch, strictly necks and domes

[Hook: Big Punisher]
I'm on the Cross Bronx with uh three of my mens

Raise a prophet, make hot lava spit out like vomit
We Vietnam it, scramble ya brain like an omelette
Spling baby link the bomb it, keep you reek niggas in bondage
A convicts we Allah, then we bomb it
We trom it, it take a Terror Squad to disarm it
We layin with grenades in our palms, two hours longer

[Big Punisher]
Ah shit nigga, you got me started momma one of the good boys
Said she got a 400 pound retarted Bronx nigga from the Projects
What nigga you don't want it, cock figga figga got it
You make me sick, fuckin wit Pun, youse a crazy bitch
Hold him for ransom, or cut off his tongue in cause he itchin
80 stitches across cheak, 70 more for talkin cheap
A buck 50 even nigga, that's regulation on the street

{yo and come on scratched}

"No man can go against me!"

{more scratchin}

"You don't stop me"

[Kool G. Rap]
Probaly socks soes inside the trenches
Closin in for miles to inches, killin the distance, enemy flinches
Death finces left for kid limus
Made mine behind the barb wire fences
Crossfire tent winters
Saw my man blow, bandana tied tight like Rambo
Burn a slug make the land glow
Niggas screamin for medics and ammo
Every soldier in your camp go

[Big Punisher]
Me and my man Joe got ya back
AKA Joey Crack, AK with the mack, makin my to the pack
Everyday I gotta be strapped, cuz niggas don't know how to act
You don't wanna go the gap, cuz T-Squad gonna react
Whatta we go? thugs and ammo, by a hundred tons of guns and rambos
Just in case you comin Commando
I'm a Sopranos and Corleones wit they own armies
And a couple of morrenos that'll die for me

[Kool G. Rap]
Hammers a law under the camouflage here to take charge
Put a cap inside ya cap and leave a four in your sarge
Killas are large, my two trade pound gauge will sound hard
For every round sabotage, bodies hit the ground hard

[Big Punisher]
That's a pound dog bout to get down and put the work
Try the jury but it wouldn't work, skit but it wouldn't merk
He glass, no glass, think fast yo ass too late, muthafucka
Put a G-rap is too fast

{scratches}

"Act like you want Drama"

That's right, on any beat we sale
Don't put your money on bail, put it on Full Scale
Ha ha, never fail, KRS

I'd rather have a hundred-thousand true heads by me
Than one million of your fake fanatics behind me
I keep it grimy, chase me, you will never find me
I take you out in two or three minutes, you can time me
You the dopest MC? I leave that ass sizzlin
I'm givin more rhythm than gang rapes in prison
You small time, you ain't a pro
Yeah you kick the raw rhymes, but your show and your flow
That's all mine
Oh silly me, if I call on my lyric ability
I'll bring it right, straight to your jaw, free delivery
Get wit me, now I spit rap
I represent peace and knowledge, but I will contradict that!
Click-a-click clap
You don't wanna battle me, you wanna scat away
I battle Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Wait, let me check the schedule again, Saturday
I think you oughta follow your squad, they ran thataway
These rappers be played out, spaced out, no format
Now why would you place your money on that?
I drop more bars than Sing-Sing, cha-ching!
Real teachers teach real things
I brings knowledge and skill, you should try to get with it
Challenging knowledge only means that ya ignorant
With the Sword of Justice, your throat I'm stickin in
Gossip and scandal, I don't put my lips in it
Grow up, I'm movin like a U-Haul truck
You all stuck cuz you all suck, duck duck buck buck buck
Forget the cut hops, your luck stops
I bring it to your buttocks, with nuff Glocks

[Big Punisher]
Yo, my squad is honored it like Elijah Muhammed
But I'm God-retarded, ain't no righteousness in this heart of violence

[A.G.]
Now check flacco, siete quato rocks in my music note
It don't take a lot for you to go
There's a lot that you should know
Like I rock the future flow
I can't be stopped, refuse to go, and still great, Show
Dug in the milk crates, so we label this cream
Plus my vocals, now we able to gleam
A's-Team used to be local, now we get love from mainstream
Rock from Shanghai to Beijing, stay high's the main theme
Used to have a crush on Regine when she was Tootie
Rappers actin fruity, tryin to black and blue me
He must be actin a movie
I'm dirty, like double-platinum in a hooptie
Now let's double back for these groupies
Back up behind the ropes, Show and A come through
We the real Killers, y'all Replacements for John Woo
This is "Full Scale" shit here, the weak disappear
They only eat in our off-years, check the CD, it's all there
You'll be bustin the speaker, puffin the reefer
Can't spit like I spit so you get hype and bust your heater
Heard your chick's on my dick, I would love to meet her
Hit it, and toss it like it ain't nuttin either
And catch you on the rebound like Dennis
My sound sells in and out of town
This a chemistry and I got it now
They wanted Six's for the Range but I got 'em down
To twenty and a brick, now I'm out wit this money and shit[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Brace yourself before you get yourself laced
Fucking with the spic piece of shit scarface
Tony Mon, rolling with Joey the only don
Cartagena, cock the nina, its on
Enter my world of doom, consume fear and feel the panic
I ram a lightning bolt between the earth and moon and curl the planets
I'm ?palanatic? wit lyrics spannin for galaxies
Battle me, mathematically, I'm givin your wisdom a cavity
Rapidly flowing, controlling the time
Flip over the line, I'm blowing your mind wit just a flow and a rhyme
I'm Hogan in his prime, strong and fast
You can bomb and blast, c'mon, you'll still be on your ass
It's satisfaction guaranteed, you're fiction like Quentin Tarantin'
Kickin your baddest dreams, shit you haven't seen
I have to be perfectly honest
We should have an anniversary to acknowledge the way I work the ebonics
I verbally vomit on how much niggas try to get us
With garbage lyrics, my style delivers it as the Outer Limits
I'm like the pyramids cuz every point is precise
Now you know me for life, four pound, Cuban flooded wit ice


[Hook x2]

Brace yourself before you get yourself laced
!!ing with the sick arabic scarface
We represent a cold race, thugs full of hate
Enemies of the state behind closed gates

[Verse 2: Canibus]

First nigga to move, gets laced like shoes
Its an example, so the second nigga knows what i do
Where im from, we dont give a !! about rules we grimy
"You think I'd kill two kids and a woman?"
....aight mother!!er try me
Im one of the worst scarfaces reincarnated
That carving your name in the pavement ish is outdated
I go to Mount Rushmore with high powered lasers
Replace all 4 of them faces with 4 facelifts
One at a time, until they all look like mine
A new and improved design for the 1 triple 9
A better nicca with better lyrics and better rhymes
Ahead of my time ill even put my life on the line
While youre in the studio writing your rhyme
Ill run up in it with a hydrogen bomb singing the sacred psalm
...
And than I'll blow us all to hell in the name of Allah

[Hook x2)]

[Verse 3: Tragedy Khadafi]

Yo
You ain't a thug, screaming at the sight of your own blood
Ill run up in your spot and take everything you make
Masked and gloved it, the way we dubbed it you loved it
Lost like an innocent child soon as the slug hit
Thug shit, wild like Geronimo Pratt
Ill disarm you and stand right in front of your gat
Yeah for real though niccas can !! with my piece see
Its real tho you can get clapped back to BC
We burn cali in QB, hashy, team be
Steady extremely....islamic
Atomic, rip mics like Prophet Muhhamad
More or less, my war techs tear your chest
Hot slugs have you dripping from chest to Gortex
You small minded, you can't fuck with my degrees
Leukemia heads, smoked to many trees
Brace yourself before you get yourself laced
Fucking with the sick arabic scarface
Iron sheik, still creep, wrapped in turban
Laptops in the headrest, black suburban

[Hook x2][DJ Clue: with echo effect]
Fantastic Four: Cam'ron, Pun, Nore, Canibus

[Cam'Ron]
You never hear that we buckle; beef? We chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything I put my money in, gotta see double
Unless y'all wanna see trouble
You realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Tell you it's crack, then hand a vial ?
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they lick my balls
Right after I play ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. Hear what I say y'all?
O.K. y'all. Ask AJ y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like Stacy Dash, she was eatin' Tracy ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up Desert Storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the Don fall
But I'll come inside The Tunnel, nigga, wit Pope John Paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on Street Soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
Keep 2 bones and 2 phones in each Rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace is all we asking, but I get buck wild like Corey Jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin Nicholi (/nicks), nigga, like Volkof
Know what I mean yo? Notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like El Nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta Lex Coupe
With Jimmy Jones right next to me in the Benz Truck too

[Big Pun]
Fuck all y'all non-believers, I roll wit God, the squad and T.S
Out wit the BS; we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brain brolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin it down, walkin around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin you down with the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit, now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in back of the Ac
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than Kung Fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

[Noreaga]
Talk about huh? That's what we talk about thug shit

Now what's a symphony, without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My jewels shit on cats without Tiffany
N-O-R-E, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the whip on any street
I fuck wit Clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with Clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' Nore lay pretty low
But them niggas is [ho]mos just like the Maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of Chico DeBarge
Thugged Out's 1st lady (let's go half on a baby)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thou on my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ayo, the President is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get head too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, "go head boo"
Thugged Out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, Cam'Ron and Punisher too
And the beats usually done by Duro and Clue

[Canibus]
Who the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign, far from being boring
My style is hard like Castle without McCormick
I run through your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like AIDS cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a Street Fighter like Jean Claude
And I'll split your shit, par
Right down the middle
Play you like a fiddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like Monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the Desert Storm annual extravaganza
Crew rolls deeper than the Cartwrights on Bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in Porsches
Can't be tested or F'ed wit, I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of Canibus (/cannabis) that's side-effectless
The type of shit that get the Question-mark Man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on MCs to watch their meat blacken
You try to get fly, you get electrified and fried
And fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me or walk away without a black eye
Word up hops, CLUEminat' call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, the cops call SWAT
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the National Guard
Ready or not like the Fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what CLUEminati did to you
The maximum lyrical, nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you

Motherfucker... CLUEminati ninety-eight

[DJ Clue: with echo effect]
DJ Clue... The Professional[Verse One: Big Pun]
I got the sweetest heist, million in cash, another 3 in ice
Who can I trust? Cuban'll bust plus get the beef tonight
Here's the plan (plan), we nab the man, bring a camcorder
Grab his fam, and run the train on his granddaughter
"Nah chill, that's too ill, for real I'd rather kill somethin
Here's the deal, we shatter his grill, and drill fuck him
Oral torture, no doubt, the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops he's guaranteed to cap and give up all the morsels"
It's settled, blitt up, put on your metal, foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto, a rebel of chance, the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash, level advance
Takin a chance, I've only got one my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge jury and Johnny Cochran

[Hook]
Movin on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash a niggas shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin laced
Look at my face and I'mma shoot the place

[Verse Two: Big Pun]
Aiyyo the plot thickens, I'm pickin the locks in the back entrance
Payin attention, not tryin to get knocked and catch a fat sentence
Not to mention these kids is mafioso with lots of dough so
They got the popo locked with a Don "The Rock" Muraco chokehold (oh oh)
Their security system's linear laser protection
No sweat, I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin
Inspectin the vault, for weapons assault, second of course
It's poisonous rays, boiled and baked in epsom salt
Rep in New York is the cat burgalar, the fat murderer
Slippin the clip in the Mac, inserterer
Hurtin your pockets, droppin your stock to zero profit
Holding heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like DeNiro mob flicks
Back to the top again, hand the grand prize
The safe flies open, the shining was blinding my eyes
I cracked the code, enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban started movin for the back real slow
That's when I heard the sirens hopin that my ears was lyin
Knew we was dyin when I saw the guard we tortured cryin
Pointing at the building screamin, "I can see them, kill em!"
Snipers was willing but couldn't, there's too many civilians
Still inside nowhere to hide nowhere to run
Cuban said, "Fuck it, we die, we die busting our guns"

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Big Pun]
Aiyyo it's time to pay, and I ain't trying to give my shine away
Let's show these pigs how much we give a fuck about the bright of day
I cocked the Eagle, Cuban drew the Glock it was diesel
Said, "See you in Hell coppers" and started poppin like it was legal
We need a plan, if we can make it to the van
Missile launchers there with the grenade pistol I bought from Uncle Dan
Me and my man are runnin out of ammo, I got about a handful
Of Black Rhinos and two Rambles strapped to my ankles
I trampled over one of the bodies, I grabbed the steel
Threw the bitch over my shoulder and used her butt as a shield
I filled the clip with the little bit of bullets remaining
Cuban said, "Move your fat ass faster motherfucker they gaining"
I gave him the case, told him, "Go ahead save yourself
Blaze a L in my memory, tell the family I gave em Hell"
For real, that's when I heard the tires screechin
Peeped and it was Joe the God with twenty Terror Squad niggas reachin

*conversation and gunfight to fade*
