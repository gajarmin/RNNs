[Dave Atkinson & Trackmasters]

[Intro: AZ]
This is what, this what they want huh
This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Se√±or Escobar

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece
Laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz
So what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sipping Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki
The Firm baby, volume one[Produced by Cormega, Jae Supreme, and Stanley Oh]

[Verse 1: Cormega]
I'm sick of gossiping bitches and niggas who gossip like bitches
Claimin' they live but if you pop 'em they snitchin'
Some watch from the building and gain knowledge of dealers
Knowin' they lack the heart of those thats out on the benches
I was out in the trenches-which enables me
To paint such a powerful picture like Apocalypse Now
I put my heart in my lyrics everytime I sit down to write
My *Source* a inspiration, ain't three and a half mics
I must have been an MC in my past life
Presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm mad nice
People act like I don't deserve nothing I got
I grew up in the spot, my sleep was interrupted by customers knocks
Some of y'all should just stop the animosity you got for me, luck it was not
For years we ran our projects like a marathon, its catastrophic
Our time, death, and pride came out on conquest
Subsequently some are with me others ain't, yet the gutter's within me
I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me
Some place judgement against me based on nothing but envy
They pray for My Downfall like the song by Biggie
Born in the city which never sleeps 'til rest in peace
Is carved in stone, some starved while others bled to eat
Rap is my legacy, I leave my seed my destiny
Except I hope she never see the treachery success could bring
The trife life and death of kings
I'm from the rarest breed of people who rep the street and spit poetically
Never sleep, rest assured Mega is dope in his pure form
The dealer/MC keepin it real is my protocol
Fall back I got you open off the style I was workin on it
The beat is lifeless, 'til I put my verses on it
I reminisce confinement as I read a kite
From my people with secret indictment, freedom and triumph
Contemplating putting sprees on the tires
Dominating this beat with my rhyming as if you need a reminder
I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on The Wire
What other lyricist is known for giving people consignment
I'm eager to find my equal in rhyming, I rock Iceberg jeans with the Nikes
An extremist with rhymin deep as Poseidon
Breedin' in violence now I live in a peaceful enviroment
A secret asylum from the streets where people be wilding
Some blind with fury from seeing me shining
Like a phoenix arising from the depths showin' the reaper defiance(Verse 1)
When I came home from jail we was brothers
Your beef was my beef
Remeber that time with Butta on your video set
When he was talkin' bout shootin'
If you don't pay him, then I got into it
Son you gave me a hundred dollars when I came home
I didn't complain I wasn't in it to gain
You my nigga when you hot and when the temperature changed
Now we enemies, 'til we enter the grave
When I got signed to Def Jam I offered you ten grand
You said you didn't want it, then you started acting funny
It started with the cover of YSB
A picture of The Firm, everyone except me
Then my voice disappeared off La Familia
That's when it was clear to me there wasn't no real love
I was out The Firm, unless I signed a production deal
Which I didn't do cus son, that wasn't real
I was never jealous of you
In fact I was proud of you
I smiled when I heard you on "Live at the Barbeque"
I respect you as an artist thou I'm no longer fond of you
I gave you love from the heart unlike the people surrounding you

(Chorus)
Love in, Love out
Nowaways is no honor, only drama
Your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow
Never show weakness, tell 'em no secrets
What's deep is, I had love for you
But due to situations, I can't fuck with you
Trust is a luxury I can't afford
Betrayal's something that I can't ignore

(Verse 2)
My love is real
Some earn it, some are unworthy
Some, walk in the prescence of men with thoughts to hurt me
And wonder why I throw shade and stay to myself
Cus I'm me, plus I'm not betraying myself
I'm free from the burden of extending my hand
To my man's that don't deserve it
I only trust fam
When I was locked up, you was doing you excluded me
You should be happy now that I'm doing me
Niggas, acting like I won't give if I have it
I got a question: Who came to Spank wake empty handed?
You smile in my face yet your eyes reveal the hate
Next time you talk about me, mention I ain't fake
I'm living my dream, live yours
I gave sweat and tears
You didn't even buy my CD, you say you my man? (uh)
You so jealous your emotions make you careless
I hope when you hear this it makes you think before you staring
At your last I hear you scheemin'
I'm reading you your last right
Get your mind off primitive thoughts and get your cats right
I'm not limited, without rap I'd still be gettin' it
Yours truly, the dealer / lyricist

(Chorus)Nas: What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?

Yea I'm about to write this letter, lay it down you know?

[Verse 1]
Dear Nas, what up son it's Mega
I got your letter, me and my cousin Oogie here together
Aiyyo your man Duke came through
You should know the situation cause we dealing with the same crew
And you can tell that crab shorty I'mma hurt her
For fucking with them niggas from that crew she know we want to murder
A yo that shit about Jerome's niece is foul
She was bringing niggas mad lye when we was locked down
Word around town the 4 pounds of Glocks
On the dime block
Labels are marked now they have they full time lock
Son fuck the stupidness
Shorty be trooping it
Next time you see her hit her off with some loot and shit
Don't forget the kicks I already got flicks
Big Ice hit the bricks from c-76
Homocide D's are ready to blitz Trevor and Stick
String with the green his razor blade blew six
Ayo

[Hook]
One love, one life, one mind dreaming
Son one day I'm leaving
One thug showing you love for one reason
For all my niggas thats locked down and bleeding (2x)

[Verse 2]
Anyway I heard Black Jay was getting paper
Tell my nigga Nut his man Bass is here from Jamaica
I was holding down the fort at four Atherton
You couldn't touch a jack unless you had gats or box cutters
I seen an ox cutter, so many features
Niggas sneaking up and blowing motherfuckers for their sneakers
I seen this kid cut police up, for real money creeped up
Slid the ills out and blew the beast up
Yo handcuffs can make a man tough and suffer
My rhymes keep your mind stimulated like a lye puffer
Yo this life is type bugged
I'm surrounded by dope fiends and thugs
But I'm a still maintain my brain frames so...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo the other day I got it on in my dorm
I had Fila slippers on then I transformed
My man dawg from Nostrand in the back posted
Money started looking when he seen dawg approaching
I said, yo black we could take it to the back
But thats about the time the razorblade made contact
I got relaxed, in fact he collapsed and bitched up
And got ripped up and stitched up for trying to tough
I picked up my ill - son said chill
Yo parlay about the way the kid's face spilled
Stashed my ox in case they throw my ass in a box
I could splat the first idi-ot looking for props
The phone time locked, my chrome ox makes domes hot
If I can't live then I'mma blow up your whole spot
Seen shorty on her visit and gave her a hug
When she cried I recognized we symbolized one love..[Intro]
Listen to me good
The artist is the most important person
You are the feature
People listen to you, they don't listen to their preachers

[Verse 1]
Exaggerated tales of hustin' we quick to pass judgment and fail our brothers
Instead of talkin' bout Lauryn Hill talk about Lauren skill, truth be told there may never be a girl as ill
Don't gossip bout Dame Dash, give props to Dame hand
For the rise of Jay and for signing Kanye, man
Niggas is crazy that's why we ain't got shit
Rappers hate each other not the labels that got rich
Don't care about culture they only want profit
If your album sells slow bet you get dropped quick
Q-Tip warned us the industries toxic
For reference check out B.D.P - "Sex and Violence"
When Styles made "I Get High" it was playin' all day
When Styles made "I'm Black" it didn't get enough play
I guess they got a problem with anything positive
Doesn't make sense if it doesn't bring dollars in

[Interlude]
Those that managed us
Those that were our agents
Those that were our accountants
Those that were the records executives
Those that were the owners of the record label
You never got true accounting for nothing that you did

[Verse 2]
What‚Äôs the difference between a label and pimpin'
You sell yourself, they tell you how to spend it
Ho ass niggas slow down, listen
Pimps prey on minds with no ambition
They keep you fly ‚Äî images, promotion
They keep you high, so a nigga isn't focused
You livin‚Äô in a moment, feeling yourself
They livin' in plush homes, what‚Äôs really success?
And what‚Äôs swag?
I don‚Äôt care how you dress or what you drive
I want rhymes that really impress
You say it‚Äôs all about money, do you even invest?
Any time in your rhymes, let me guess
You‚Äôre so nice you don‚Äôt write, it just comes to you
‚ÄòCause you the shit ‚Äî nah, you just dodo
I lyrically abuse any rapper who choose to step to me
I will bring it right to you!

[Interlude]
Who do you think you are?
To them you are nothing but a piece of meat
And you are only as valuable as your last hit song
And when you make no more hit songs
Nobody cares for you no more

[Verse 3]
Men lie, women lie
Numbers can be altered
To look high, shareholders hate taking losses
This is business, they don‚Äôt care about your lyrics
The better you sell, the better future for their children
Controversy sells so they support conflict
Makes more progress means more profit
And artists get killed they say they so sorry
Meanwhile they tell you the date of his next project
What a life, death made it more profit
Record companies get paid for your drama
And ‚ÄúBeef‚Äù DVD is on BET
So every artist who was on it was beefin‚Äô for free
While the royalties are going to QD3
He Quincy Jones son, what he know about beef?
No disrespect intended, I know he got beats
But it‚Äôs deep how the rich get paid off our grief

[Outro]
And every one of our great artists they die ‚Äî with nothing
And the record company executives were rich, sending their kids to college
You‚Äôre not stupid ‚Äî you are brilliant
But the question is: can you put your brilliance in a song?
Can you put the conditions of the world in a song and inspire young people all over the world?I speak valuable lessons so check this y‚Äôall ‚Ä¶

[Verse 1: Cormega]
Love you questioning
Hate is evident
People who never voted betray you for dead presidents
Some wear two faces: friend and enemy
And gain nothing ‚Äòcause they don‚Äôt deserve anything
I risk my life for niggas who didn‚Äôt write or visit
During my time in prison I realized my friendship
Isn‚Äôt what I envisioned
And I‚Äôm tired of giving
With no reciprocation, thankfully times are different
I pray for friends I‚Äôve lost
Grateful to find religion, in my life
Keeping it real is making right decisions
Loyalty has its toll it costs nothing to mind your business
You can add this to the list of deepest lines I‚Äôve written
I guess my higher vision comes from knowing sky‚Äôs the limit
And I acquired wisdom from trying from failure
Money can come and go but valuable lessons
Are never bad investments and they last forever

[Chorus]
All these lessons that I‚Äôve learned only mean one thing
I just want to live my life
Never make the same mistake
Promise I‚Äôm going to make it right

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Emphatically my blood circulates conscious
My family is blood that circulates gossip
My sister calls my cousin
My cousin calls his mom but
Nobody calls me and I‚Äôm the topic
Similar to what my aunt did to my father
Was consumed by drugs while she consumed vodka
I ain‚Äôt feeling that
Hypocritical, judgmental bullshit
The pot calling the kettle black
So simmer down; one thing I never lack
Is food for thought ‚Äì I just faxed
The main course, crabs want to pull you back
When you make it out because they lack
Potential to rise
It‚Äôs clear to see the root of evil has affected my family tree
Can‚Äôt bloom
Resentment and greed
Are so deep my grandmother was victim of thieves
Of her own kin
Though we all sin
I call it how I see it; that‚Äôs some cold shit
I forgive but I won‚Äôt forget
Siblings acting funny over money; I don‚Äôt owe you shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Cormega]
We loved hard and fought harder
If we fought as hard for love, we‚Äôd be much stronger
You want to argue ‚Äòbout what I didn‚Äôt do
Yet ignore what I did
When you accuse me of cheating it was only your guilt
Manifesting itself as a result
You‚Äôd rather hate me than be mad at yourself
Now you free; we no longer trapped in lies
You never find happiness until you happy inside
We‚Äôve been up, we‚Äôve been down
We laughed and we cried
But through it all I showed you I‚Äôm a provider
Now you taking me to court saying you need support
For your living expenses
Really? How is this?
You get advice from women who senseless
With no life so they want to get in my business
Ignorance can‚Äôt match infinite wisdom
It‚Äôs supreme over weak schemes and hidden agendas

[Chorus][Verse 1]
Even though mad niggas hate it
I remain the most anticipated
Those glad a nigga made it bast your Nickel-plateds
And salute the realness, cause mad niggas fake it
When I peel hit the floor
I conceal bricks so raw
I got the sickest Six-Four you ever seen
I saw and conquered
When it's on and poppin' my Dogs are barkin'
To eat food, my enemies feel heat like Purico
Some suggest they're equal
Lyrically I'm like a Desert Eagle
Mentally I measure Kilos
Physically I'm compared to Tito Trinidad, both hands are lethal
The crowned Prince
My underground shit you don't fuck around wit'
I move pies and fire loud shit
I'm in The Tunnel with the crowd nigga fuck V.I.P
Where Brooklyn go crazy when you bump B.I.G
And Queens feel it when you pump that Mobb Deep
That Jay-Z and Nas beef doesn't involve me
I'm sorry, legal hustle, Infamous affiliated
Last rapper to test me I humiliated
And for your information the jewels ain't rented from Jacob
When I move I leave a dent in the pavement
My name ring in jail and not for givin' no statement
That type of foulness consider it flagrant
O.T., give me a brick and see I'm gifted as Masons
I'm the realness, you spittin' that fake shit
Life's a bitch, I'mma take her on an expensive vacation
If it's on I'm the Reaper with the glistenin' bracelet
Sleepers awakened
Screamin' like they seen Satan
Word to Christ I need paper, keep the fake love
A fake thug couldn't sell a rock on the block I was raised on
Huh?!

[Hook]
Get out my way, gimmie mine or I'mma take whats yours
Make love war, spray up doors
Get out my way, you industry, we in the street
Wit' the heat pickin' weight up raw
Get out my way, stop screamin' what set you rep if you don't come around
The way no more
Get out my way, who want what, say no more
Matter fact take that chain off Dog

[Verse 2]
I gave niggas enough time - to front
I'm a beast on the street like crushed white
You can't be me, close your eyes, you can't see me
I'm the phantom in your concience
The shadow in the darkness
Savage when I write, I'm heartless
I'm iller than you, realer than you
Still with more Killers than you
It's mandatory, I'm self explanatory
Don't front on me, you didn't have cash before me
I'm the essence
You don't gotta like it, respect it
Like the ice on my necklace
And the fact I'm supplyin' connections
If you rhyme ill I'm the sickness that caused it, you thought you'd
Assume my position
I be hustlin', bubblin', gettin' money
Causin' blind rage with the Twenties
Y'all niggas is funny like Martin Lawrence
We out before the Narcs get on us
My life wasn't written, yours was, you livin' a lie
I'm dealin' wit' pies, all feelings aside
My enemies kneel when I rise
The realness in my eyes
From blood, sweat, and tears I cried
I got friends who died before they got to see me shine
How dare you compare your weak CD to mine
Or think you could see me with rhymes
Easily I'm, nicer than you and all your peoples combined

Chorus[Cormega]
Son I was a young nigga hustling
Me serving a D was unheard of, unless a D served me
Speak words superbly, its clear you heard me
Your idea of a real nigga changed
I'm into bigger things
I'm tryin to maintain the same aim of prisoners
Drug dealers and my niggas who gangbang
The game changed, shit is on fire
Niggas went from greatness to statements and wires
So scared to face bids they betrayed their suppliers
So niggas outta state, you want weight you pay higher
I'm condemned yet exalted for words spoken cautious
Seen some of the biggest drug dealers blow fortunes in bathrooms
Niggas be sniffin like vacuums
Reminisce to '88, the year crack ruled
I had Nike Delta Forces with them clear capsules
5 for 40, crackheads like "I only buy from Corey"[Cormega]
Yo, I live the life of '62 pick-ups
Pumpin' on corners, beat downs to stick-ups
Seein' events, of which I had to stay silent
Murder, extortion, and all types of violence
Kids, livin' the life of ghetto heavens
Sellin' cracks, ready to attack with knives and mac-11's
Havin' dreams of being big bosses
Driving porsches, by the time, they get rich, they corpses
Son, it's a shame, but in this game
The strong survive, either get live or get slain
Cuz in the ghetto, respect is mandatory
Drug wars ignitin', mad fightin' for territory
My niggas, steppin' with automatic weapons
Stick up kids, with .357's
Yo, it's violence, I know old timers move silent
But nowadays, niggas be wildin'
Drug dealers stylin', with 5-series Beamers
It deep the way, sunny day, don't seem to reach us
Forty-five under the seat of a Lexus
Thugs rollin' with bulletproof hats and vestes
Earnin' ya props off big dime rocks
Your man shorty rock is on the block with a Glock
He just got knocked, now he's out on bail
For semi automatic, and a undercover sale
Trained mercenary, with a heart that's cold
Pushin' an Acura, at 17 years old
In the passenger seat, and he's smokin' a blunt
With some shine on, any live nigga would want
Somebody wasn't up on and you know what they want
Tellin' shorty, run the jewels and don't try to front
Shorty reaches for the nine, but before he could shoot
Blood scattered in the '92 Acura coupe
Another victim of modern day stick-ups
This is the life of '62 pick-ups[Cormega](Nas)

Ayo check this out son
This is my man Nas Escobar
And I go by the name of Cormega you know
(you gonna get your self murdered)
Yo check this out on the real son
Anybody diss the Firm yo on the real yo
I'm bringing it to you I ain't even saying the word
Cause I ain't allowed to say it on the radio
(any Firm members come out your mouth wrong)
We keepin' it crazy real son on the real
(violate the grand you get split in half)
Son you gonna set it? set it son
Matter of fact though

[Nas]

I peep you frontin, I was in the Jeep
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine
Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time
Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin me my name, what the ugh
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown cat's through, blazin at his crew

I can't believe it achieve
Yo Cormega whatever whatever whatever

[Cormega]
Pushin' a red lex
With many screams inside the headsets
So much beef, police surprised I ain't dead yet
I keep red tech in the passenger seat
To match their heat
It's so real if I don't see you I'm splashing your beep
It's on the kid
Whoever gets his first
It's going to kids dirt
My soldiers be cold blooded vultures
And cold blooded
Yo on the street we control hundreds
I drink polatas so all my people roll blunted
Your man froze when I rolled up
I symbolize death like a cobra
Attacks your life here it's over
Black you effed up
Never should've messed up
My black cocksucker scared to die tough luck
You know my steelo im like Al Pacino
Yo Nas Escobar grab the mic and flex a bar

[Nas]
I'm in the black limo
Jack Daniel through the crack window
I spot the fake red dot his face like a Hindu
Grab the symbol
Show examples to make examples
Essential amounts you owe to the fam crew
Firm affiliation paper chasing
Chip glossy rich pablo es cubano
Sophisticano
Yo blazing halos like shadow
Yo nigga im the castro
Im coming through on your wack crew
What you gonna do
Cormega pick the mic come through

[Cormega]

Ay yo I get mines
Well enough to be considered big time
My crew a chosen few legit minds
Who live prime
Shorty's on some fly stuff
Admitted that can't resist mines
Mahogany complexion
Body probably dressed in
My ill tommy hill collection
When I be flexin', sketch it
My selection of words are type effective
When I rhyme words are verbalized remain present
In mines, I'm like an with air macs nikes on
Recite nice on mics strike like a python
My gold chain with ice on lookin' trife on
My Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming
Lounging like a falcon on a mountain top at Egypt
Cats schemin when they see my rocks gleaming
Mega shine forever rhyme wicked like a demon
Where my charcoal, new balance a lot yo
The narcs go knocked my man Marco
His money was marked yo
I regulate a sharp flow
But in my life bucaso
My mom died when I was five and never left my heart yo
I symbolize rive alive niggas
Ghetto's where I live
Considered my rhyme the oasis
Because rap was a desert
And I helped minds escaped it
Yo Nas link it up it's like an ill typed bracelet

[Nas]

Fake thug, no love
You get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low
I didn't know til I was drunk though
You freak cats get played out
Get robbed and laid out
Prostitute turned snitch
I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range
Empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, thirty-two shots
Ya'll niggas don't want none of this

[Cormega]

Ayo check it my man Joe Shan is downstairs
My man Georgie is lounging downstairs
My man Big Ice he lounging in Queensbridge
And all you real cats know what time it is
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
Now check the new verse
Check the new verse it's ill
Yo my millennium got people mind prisoner
Pain digital wood brain material
Rims spin sinister
Grin like John Dillinger
Iced out medallions my style will keep killin' ya
Misery and jealousy when you envision me
I'm getting mines and still livin' on the strength of me
You never bust nothin' or got ill touched nothin'
My baby face ice grill I heard something for real
In any cipher i'll serve em like a viper
I go for mines like I go for time on Rikers
Steelo like pacino benzino benz bilo we know
People we dope like mafiaso like gambino
Where Sergio Tacchinio took a jab in a casino
I like sony cause they saw my man keeno
Can't forget my home girl Faith Newman
She be boomin'

Every percent in
In my firm team
We so ill our people burn cream
Rhymes I design

Yo I lived the life of 62 pick ups
Pumping on corners beat downs and stick ups
Seeing events in which you have to stay silent
Murder extortion and all types of violence
Yo kids living a life ghetto heaven
Selling cracks getting ready to attack with nines and mac elevens
You know my style
You can't stop what knocks me down
Peace to AZ, Nas, and figure Foxy Brown
My whole firm team is ill no doubt
I can't forget the commissioner he's called Steve Stoute
With the ill benz
He rocks the ill dimes and ill rims
You know my steelo
I'm like Al Pacino
God bless the life of my man nino

[Nas]

It's sort of like the conclusion to "Color Purple"
Brothas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where Brothas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress, but yo that's another subject
I love teks let's get it off
Yo what up what up

[Cormega]

Yo funkmaster flex you know I got the ill lex
I wear my guests in apendix
And cash my cheque in flesh shit
My man escobar be lighting a weed
And I proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need
I'm not the new jack, or crew rack I'm like the next man
Cormega, I just got signed to Def Jam
My man Nas is down with me
A lot of sucker rappers they can't diss me
It's like that, you know it's like that
We'll strike back Queensbridge style
My mobb deep people is mad foul
A juvenile delinquent wet your prequit
I get my money numerous occasions
It's frequent my man Ike
Tried to avalanche ice watch
You know my steelo Al Pacino
Yo Escobar

[Nas/Cormega]
Escobar season
Cormega 4 reason
We with it what
I'll stay high triple beamin
Queensbridge[Dave Atkinson & Trackmasters]

[Intro: AZ]
This is what, this what they want huh
This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Se√±or Escobar

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece
Laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz
So what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sipping Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki
The Firm baby, volume one[Foxy Brown]
Check it, uhh
Protect this, nigga for the necklace
I throw the death wish; the pretty slim sex shit
The rep this, remember Fox said this
We on some next shit, we are blessed this
The scares on our backs mean we met this
To lie for 'em
The 25 sentence to keep my eyes on 'em
I'm straight, knowing when Allah's shine on 'em
Shitty drugs and drama, opposite three pretty thugs and a don momma
Filling the rest, the steel in their chest
When Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over
And we laid out, chill I was open off the way he ate out
It was real, fo'real I was fucking with mills and he was frag-ile
We wyling, the brown stallion
Stay styling, on the low fouling
The whole Firm wyling, we lucked it
I know the trick bitch he fuck with, on some duct shit
Heard through the grade that she sucked it
Firm, Sos and Esco, mad loco
Fox and Mega for whatever, and through this cheddar
We gon' stay family, 'til we fry though
The fam will never split even if one of us die though
Along with our get go's, we gon' blaze 'til it brick-o's
Peep the Ill-Na-Na, sweet taboo
The Firm tattoo on the Dada
Now tell me what crew hold it down like we do da da?

[AZ]
'Til the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless
Ice necklace, high priced dressed executives
Peep the grammar, slim built, strong stamina
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep
Shit remain deep in get shells thrown at ya Range jeep
Giuliani sweep got all the kings going up the creek
Devil life beers now who's left controlling the streets?
No intelligence, strictly slow niggas minds negligence
It's evident, Feds vest up, raid ya residence
We're all for living, heavyweight Firm division
Mind, I check mine. Eating swine is against my religion
You know the steez, take aim, cock and squeeze
It's the prophecies, not the philosophies of Socrates
Next up? (Yo I believe that's me)
Ayo Mega, represent for the family

[Cormega]
Ayo, the Feds got me in the top ten
Cause when my door got knocked in
My four-four main cocked in
My sinister mind, shines like a Dillinger
Mega exhausted, Babyface crime Emperor
Yo, life is based on cultures and creeds
And peep the way drug fiends, the thug nigga sees
I've seen niggas lined up, handcuffed and tied-up
Coke prices rise up when drugs supply dry-up
The Millennium drives up
Rims semi blinds ya eyes temporarily
Mind of Mega be heavily armed for felonies
Shine you could never see
The next fat cat out of NYC
It Was Written like ghetto life hieroglyphics
Living since my real niggas bailed me out of prison
A lot of schemes, cause the narcotics team in Queens
Had marked dollars then the knowledge of fiends
My dream is the legacy of Montana treasury
Fake thugs couldn't even take slugs or bury me

[Nas]
To all thoroughbreds taking the corners, y'all need to join us
Firm's most powerful nation of rap performers
High class, Generals, Confidence, paying lawyers
Swift as Oscar De La Hoya, green beret warriors
Fakes I peep them like the J. Kennedy tape
In the new with Jew busting all in the face
Another word yo, you see through
My man built the Sugar Hill from a sweet tooth
We all eat, cause I speak truth and educated
Black youth, street diploma
Teach Greeks and Romans, but the legacy was stolen
It's a Firm thing, generally gleam
I wrote the theme on how to sell a million
While you crabs is mad at your promotion team
I roll with the nicest Fox
Black ice, pushing Benz without a license
Gear tight as vice grips, Nas got 19 wifies
Seven shiesty, nine of them pisces
Three white meats under tight cheese
Wilding, big links is heavy like bricks
That you throw on a pit-bull neck's while feeding 'em raw steak
It's core take, more cake
I take the crown of the so called king of the town and lock it down[Cormega]
I ain't forget the hunger pains
Stomach growlin like thunder and rain
Fame calmed the savage that I once became
My status wasn't established from trying to get a name
It came from serving addicts letting automatics bang
My physical form grew stronger in a Riker's Island cage
Only as to weaken so many of my people
Passed away like leaves in the wind
Or kids blowing ashes from trays
I possess the ghetto essence of that which I portray
I'm an emotional chamelon, see how I adapt to pain
Before we enjoy the sun we must first get past the rain
A lyricist similiar to Donnie Hathaway
Clearly superior to many all I really lacked was fame
The +True Meaning+ that fact remains
My presence is felt like the Knicks when Patrick reigned
I'm living now, fuck back in the day
Does freedom have a meaning if you trapped in your ways
I'm Queensbridge most respected rapper
That ain't gone change...[Intro]

*phone rings*

[Mega] yo
[Girl] Hey
[Mega] Whussup
[Girl] Chillin
[Mega] Word
[Girl] Working
[Mega] Yeah, nahmsaying
[Girl] Well when you coming home?
[Mega] I'm a be there later on
[Girl] Well look, wee need to talk
[Mega] Ahh boy
Yo listen, check this out

[Corega]
Last night I had a dream, it had me opened like a fiend
I remember its me you, the moon and ocean breeze
My heartbeat increased, like I seen approachin' D's
I relax cause of these words you spoke to me
You said "You wanna feel me"
Inside you, conceal me
I belong to you, no other woman can steal me
You mentally attached, essentially in fact
What you give is so real, you know I had to give it back
How I feel don't even matter, if I ain't expressing
Affection, my mind was infected you healed me
We destined, your beauty so addictive
I can't deny your presence
So pure, I got to add cut to stretch it
Your all I need in this world to succeed
I won't let you go cause I can see you trust me
I never, leave or deceive you
And if its understood, then we can be together
Cause you treat a nigga good

[Jonell]
All I need is you
- In my life, to be down with me
All I need is you
- To hold me, and to make me see
All I need is you
- To be there in my time of need
All I need is you
- I'll be there when you need me to be

[Cormega]
When I was running he streets, I know you wanted to leave
Especially the time, you found a nine in my jeans
But you persevere, gave work and tears
That's why I'll never desert you or hurt you, yeah
I used to keep feelings concealed, now I reveal em'
I was hustling to get right, now we chillin
All my mans staring at the ceiling, thinking of children
And any other situation, we might deal with
At first I was hesitating, making a commitment
Now I see you different, so many ways
I need a Queen like a King, did he pray Egyptians days?
And it seems you been afraid, I might get into things
That might put me away for years, save your fears
Listen ma, lets get one thing clear
I never leave you, deceive you, and if its understood
We could be together, cause you treat a nigga good

[Hook]

[Cormega]
Yo, I'm not the type to have a next chick calling your phone
Come see you at night, and then the morning you alone
I keep it a real with you, like my connects you got it good
I need to deal with you, I've yet to leave the hood
But I'm still with you, every time you need me, I'm there for you
If I didn't care for you, why would I be here for you?
Your peer loyal, got the kids spoiled
On the low, I don't think I would prepare for you
You cook good, look good, boo I adore you
And if you get me mad, we won't fight, I'll ignore you (yeah right)
Just playing, but yo, I'm just saying
I'm about to go, cause Hi-Tek waiting
Yo son, that beat ready?

{*phone hangs up*}[Cormega]
Yo, its night time I can't sleep
My pens beggin' me to write rhymes
Cory's a felony despite time
I embrace the urge on the tip of my tongue
I taste the words a story is born, my glorious song
Hip hop cannot ignore me for long
I know her last man abused her, I can't refuse her
Alotta niggas used her, treated her like shit even confused her
She had class now she sellin it all for cash
When Marley had her, her face was more pure body fatter
Primo treated her good, made her the queen in my hood
She used to be out in Queens with DMC
And on the rooftp with Big, Fritz, and R.P
She was fly she kept her shit tight
Yo if he didn't go to jail dun, she mighta been Slick Rick's wife
Disappeared a few years, she was "Stranded On Death Row"
Dre had her on anotha level in the west coast
She met a lame with with a drug dealer name
He had a locked for a while, then his whole style changed
You know the wisdom is reflected the knowledge when its manifested
If not fed in due time the mind is anerexic
You understand the message
I know I'm gettin to deep for some
Rhyme -- Uncut raw, the beat numb
Back to the subject in hand, I called her and said I miss her
Stop fuckin with my fake crew cuz they dissed her
Then along came the R, reminding her of her essence
Rza said she like a sister blessin her with lessons
She was stressed because she missed Pac
She still crying after B.I.G. died askin 'when will this shit stop?'
I love her like a mother, my physical path
She even overlooked the fact about my criminal past
And stayed with me in jail beyond gates visitors passed
No longer is she lettin niggas fuck her just for cash
Whats her name dun? *Echoed*[Cormega]

Under the sun vultures looming
Hoping to consume a culture wounded
Boldly refusing to die show and proving
I embodied what only few can
Wearing sincerity not the robe of Judas
My golden rule is live no lie
I know truth is part of my focus
Music art imitates life growth included
I'm bound by word hold me to it
My heart and nerve are accountable no excuses
I never made a deal with my soul included
I know what's real and I know illusions
Misery loves company I chose seclusion
There's degrees to separation
I know my true friends and forced alliances
Conspiring the denial of hearing my aspiring rhyming is timeless and genuine
That's where my mind is at: a reflective state
I weigh my mans like grams
Understanding there are losses when you measure weight[Cormega]
Yo, laid back like a fat buddha holding my pearl handle luger
In a Land Cruiser rims shine like daytime in Bermuda
I rap tight smoother than niggas who be fronting like parakeet movers
I had to be financially set new lex
In front of my duplex my shine dripping wet
New nine's in case your group flex
My brown eyes leaving your boot stretched
So bad you had to get a new rep vest
Cause I collect stats, my advice is to accept that
Step back blast dont even wet that, yo
It's mandatory, I'm self explanatory
Don't front on me shorty, your man's working for me

[Hook: Havoc]
Aiyyo we move ki's
Angel dust son you get touched
Dress up get rushed
Stepping up or press luck
Cormega coming through, duck
Move slowly get bucked
Criminal minds get stitched up
Down to buy your watch or bitch up

[Cormega]
Aiyyo this crime addict mind
My rhyme status shines like a nine 'matic
Yo I'm Scarface for real I wanna die blasting fuck stashing
My next 50 G's I'm buying me a five wagon
Thugged out leather interior, mega superior
My art of war deaded your area
My mugshot praised in jail cells and drug spots
My razor touched faces and cut rocks
Corrupt cop cases had me on semi vacation
In state dreams laid down weight schemes
With niggas that get paid and take cream
Drug supplier, thugs admire
Ghetto dunn dunn gunfire deep mind none higher
Your drama equalizer
I speak the murder Keyser Soze, no survivors

[Hook] - 2X

[Cormega]
Teach on threats, concepts I didn't speak on yet
Courts feared mentally severe to the ear
Thug general, white lines for criminal minds to listen to
Chemical rhymes sparkle like a '62
Invincible foulness my style is trife like Rikers Isle get
Queensbridge projects is lounging on a cocaine mountain
Aiyyo Hav let the four pound spit, what!

[Hook] - 2X[Child]
Uncle Cory can you tell us a story please
[Cormega]
Alright, alright
[Child]
Please
[Cormega]
Y'all tucked in? Here we go

[Cormega]
Once upon a time not long ago
A lame MC didn't want me to blow
I think his name was Nasir (who?)
The "Street Dreamer" dude
Big wasn't fond of him (what?) Pac neither
Hung around my mans, Lord and Lake
Lake's doing time, Lord should get his life straight
And my man Grand Wiz living on face
Now he hangs with police
I guess they make him feel safe, anyways
He's always talking bout loot and diamonds
And I get to see a penny off QB Finest (ahhh)
That's lame, you should be ashamed
None of the Bravehearts driving (huh?)
Horse was the best, he left Nasir not shining (oh)
Said he got me a deal (uh huh), be real
Nas couldn't get on till I went to jail
Bit my style, then he eventually came up
So when I came home, he wasn't doing me no favours
Not to mention we was cool, but his pockets was hurt (why?)
He's a weedhead, don't blame skirts
Plus he never hustled, so cash is new to him
Got his chain took, and bought it back, how smooth of him
Mad at his girl, cause her favorite rappers Jay
Chipped his tooth when Spud punched him in the face (hahaha)
Abanna ceased out, when he had beef with Puffy
Nastradamus flopped, this time he got lucky
Moved from Queens cause he was getting extorted
The Firm brick, critics said I should of been on it
He's the type to strike it rich and leave his friends in the projects
With Esco jeans on, and lint in there pockets, so a
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, before this rap shit
Who was the flyest rapper of all?
There was a rumble tumble, 5 minutes it lasted
The mirror says you was you conceited bastard
I heard him on the air with Funkmaster Flex

[Child]
The one who drops bombs, if your records sell fresh?

[Cormega]
Yes that's the one, but lets get back to so n
I heard jungle in the background, he the same from
My man Ice is done a smack now, but he backed down
Noreaga fight him, so he raps now
Anyway, I don't usually waste my time on MC's
But Build & Destroy man, he really tried to diss me
What you mean? I heard the song, I said something is wrong
I never got snuffed, I got shot getting it on
And why waste your time, saying I wasn't grindin'?
Even the cops he with, said "stop lying"
I had the illest gun in Queensbridge history
The sterling, that's right, ain't no mystery
And none of my friends that's cool with him, have bricks like me
What I do in a day, they won't even get in a week
Just about then, one of my mans came in, he said
"Someone's in Miami with all your fake friends"
I looked him in his face, and said "are you sure?"
He said, "I don't wanna see you with them lowlifes no more"
So come along, we have a party to attend
Where Nas' baby mom was more of a friend
She said "don't involve me you and Nas beefing
I hear you the reason he can't come to Queensbridge
Go him so scared, he hanging out with policeman
Plus he can't fuck so I had to leave him
I said, don't even worry, I'm not tripping
Plus I respect you, good, Nas didn't, what?
When I needed a man he wasn't there
He spends all his time trying to end your career
My success is overdue
You kids get to bed nowthe story is through {*echoes 3X*}[Cormega]
Your depiction of a thug nigga, is fiction
Your words hung my nigga lines were drawn
You sided with the judge I ain't a hater
I don't love squellers thats me
You have the audacity to talk like you real
Nigga you fold under pressure, my life is real
You sold your soul to detectives I could get you murdered
But you dying a slow death denying you told yet
The truth came to light you a fake nigga
You helped the D.A.'s case my nigga
Fuck your life I hate the side of your face nigga
Only a fake nigga would respect you
You went against the cause and signed papers
The signatures yours thats that bullshit pardon me
?Sammy the bullshit? take the stand betraying the fam
Should have kept it real you put your fate in ya hand
I guess thats the way it was planned

(Hook) [Cormega]
There's a a thin line between love and hate and you crossed it
You had respect around the way and you lost it
If a coward dies a thousand deaths how you gon' live?
Nigga you get no love

[Cormega]
Death before dishonor
You sacrificed your breath so respect a nigga power in jail
I get you hit up in the shower
I'm a real nigga I walk the streets with pride
I'm the truth, you living a lie
You a part-time prosecuter, full time ?hosa?
I right rhymes with great'ness you write statements nigga
And think the streets don't know
Tssk, yo it was all good just a week ago
How could you live with being the D.A.'s witness
And knowing ya names associated with snitches
You could pray for forgiveness I'mma fact you a stool pigeon
Ain't nothing you can do nigga, might I mention
Only a bitch would snitch to get a lighter sentence
Take it like a man nigga like official prints and cornbread nigga
I'm a warrior you deserve a bullet in ya head nigga

(Hook)

[Cormega]
Uhh, I'm tired of you coming through like snitching justifiable
I once admired you, you rap bastard
Ain't no need to explain you not my man
Everytime you give me five I wash my hands
What nigga, M-E-G-A bitch tell the D.A. bricks
I move in three days not including the grindin
What polluted ya mind was it alluded time
My words are exalted yours ruin lives
You a disgrace to ya race I'm true to mine
All my doggs doing time, know before I side with the law
I rather ride with the fours and deprive you of your, coward exsistence
You probably send ya momma to prison to beat a sentence BITCH!

(Hook)(We back at it!)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, and like that I'm back at it to win
Rapper Pooh muh'fucker, don't ask again
So what I'm from the South, I don't +snap+ wit trends
I'm tryna fill my backpack, to the top wit ends
Wanna ride real low and drive slow in the Benz
Play a lil' D-Brock, put 'em on to some skins
When you done, pass that broad right back to yo friends
It ain't no fun if the homies cain't spin 'er
But that's later thinkin, I'm up later drinkin
I'm tryna come up on the beat that I can sink my teeth in
I get busy, "What shit was HE on?"
Poobie +prime time+ get it shine like De-ion
I'm cold-blooded, you can call me Fre-on
Got a couple stripes homie, I'm no d-on
You seem concern wit everything I be on
Album three's comin, bitch nigga now be warned!

[Hook: Phonte (Big Pooh)]
I hear the people talkin all of the time
Sayin we out of they league, they must be outta they mind
They betta know somethin
(I say H-O-J, we back at it)
(Phonte, Big Pooh, we back at it)

[Cormega]
My son love to set it, gun unsympathetic
Ones that ever dis-cuss, too much distrust
Went from rock fight to pickin brick up
Stick boards to stick-ups
Playin cops and robbers to hatin cops and robbin
Monopoly to the money and the power
Playin in the rain to playin wit bitches in the shower
Bicycles to flossin Coupes with chrome to bright to view
From blue Icee's to the ice that's blue
From suede Puma to suede New Balance, "Good Times" to "Martin"
Water guns to the nines we sparkin
From George Jefferson, to George on Seinfield
From, "you ain't fresh", to "y'all don't rhyme ill"
From two turntables and a microphone
To weak niggas livin off hype alone
'Mega here, niggas scared like Tyson's home
And I still got my license, homes...
(Ay, yo yo...)

[Hook: Phonte (Big Pooh)]
I hear the people talkin all of the time
Sayin we out of they league, they must be outta they mind
You betta know somethin
(I say H-O-J, we back at it)
(Phonte, Big Pooh, we back at it)
Yo, they think it's all a sport
Wanna talk the talk, but cain't walk the walk
When it's time, you betta show somethin
(I say H-O-J, we back at it) Yes, yes...
(Phonte, Big Pooh, we back at it)

[Phonte]
I see 'em whisperin, sayin that we fallin off
And in his own town, treated like a foreigner
And that's the reason I ain't had any R&R
Cause these nights I'm "Remembering" like Shalamar
My own team sayin, "Nigga, you should go for yours"
"We underground, but fuck it! Rule 'em like overlords"
Cause they ain't see a nigga creepin through the corridor
All black, back drop, next stop the coroner
Body count now around three hunnid
Don't know how many ways I can tell you we run it
Witout bein redundant, niggas scared to top me
Callin fours posse like we on Teen Summit
But this ain't a talk show, and I ain't yo guest star
Even on our worst day, you know who the best are
Tay is not the one to test par, X marks the spot
You a target, good night and God bless y'all
Silly white folks say, "He speak so well
Cause he got a way with words, it's so extraordinary"
Give you a peak into my intimate thoughts
Givin these i-lliter-ate niggas where all the fuckin coronaries
You ain't gotta worry who the next man is
Work your own grind, use it to your ad-vantage
Sensitive ass niggas stop bein so {?}
Phontigga that nigga, and yes he's back at, UH!

[Hook][Produced by Cormega, Jae Supreme, and Stanley Oh]

[Verse 1: Cormega]
I'm sick of gossiping bitches and niggas who gossip like bitches
Claimin' they live but if you pop 'em they snitchin'
Some watch from the building and gain knowledge of dealers
Knowin' they lack the heart of those thats out on the benches
I was out in the trenches-which enables me
To paint such a powerful picture like Apocalypse Now
I put my heart in my lyrics everytime I sit down to write
My *Source* a inspiration, ain't three and a half mics
I must have been an MC in my past life
Presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm mad nice
People act like I don't deserve nothing I got
I grew up in the spot, my sleep was interrupted by customers knocks
Some of y'all should just stop the animosity you got for me, luck it was not
For years we ran our projects like a marathon, its catastrophic
Our time, death, and pride came out on conquest
Subsequently some are with me others ain't, yet the gutter's within me
I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me
Some place judgement against me based on nothing but envy
They pray for My Downfall like the song by Biggie
Born in the city which never sleeps 'til rest in peace
Is carved in stone, some starved while others bled to eat
Rap is my legacy, I leave my seed my destiny
Except I hope she never see the treachery success could bring
The trife life and death of kings
I'm from the rarest breed of people who rep the street and spit poetically
Never sleep, rest assured Mega is dope in his pure form
The dealer/MC keepin it real is my protocol
Fall back I got you open off the style I was workin on it
The beat is lifeless, 'til I put my verses on it
I reminisce confinement as I read a kite
From my people with secret indictment, freedom and triumph
Contemplating putting sprees on the tires
Dominating this beat with my rhyming as if you need a reminder
I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on The Wire
What other lyricist is known for giving people consignment
I'm eager to find my equal in rhyming, I rock Iceberg jeans with the Nikes
An extremist with rhymin deep as Poseidon
Breedin' in violence now I live in a peaceful enviroment
A secret asylum from the streets where people be wilding
Some blind with fury from seeing me shining
Like a phoenix arising from the depths showin' the reaper defiance[Cormega]
Yo, truer lyrics were praised, the listeners craved
To hear our camera's get caned, the rooftop
Where the dealers will hang, and bubblegooses
And sheepskins, and DJ's play the song cuz they love the music
Way before producers, were gettin' paid for beats
Marley Marl was loopin', he made ya'll able to eat
And B-Boy's were battlin', that stay key on Allington
After school we watched Good Times and bust heroine
When Melle Mel made the Message, it was monumental
Not only was it dope, it also spoke on our issues
Like Public Enemy, my memories, essentially ill
Like hip hop was meant to be, KRS-One, Audio Two
Treacherous Three, Fearless Four, Furious Five
Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde, when T La Rock was in his prime
He spit rhymes, like no one other in his time
When it came to gettin' fly, Slick Rick, never improvise
L Rock the Bells, DMC rocked Gazelles with Shells
Skill matter, fuck ya rims and your record sales
Hip hop is Stetsasonic and Mantronix
Ultramagnetic, Schoolly D, and Bambaataa
When Whodini made "Friends", it was well spoken
When Red and Magic had their rivalry, radio was doper
Masters of Ceremony, Steady P, Dimples D
Then Just Ice, Latoya, hit the streets
Then we got the era of EPMD
The Juice Crew, MC Lyte, and BDP
Main Source breakin' atoms, had amazin' rappin' and beats
Not basically sampling, artist need to regain the passion
It doesn't matter if your chain is platinum
Itf what you say is average, you will not be mentioned with the greatest rappers
Hip hop is like Egypt, reduced from it's greatness to sadness
The industry's enemy troops that's invading our palace
They steal our culture, desecrate our sculptures and claim
The best rapper's the complexion of the Roman leader known as Caeser
I don't believe 'em, I seek knowledge, the Brand Nubian
The soul of Pete Rock, the vibe of the Tribe
Heart of Gang Starr, the braves of Diggin' In the Crates
I'm Kool like Moe Dee, vocally I innovateIt's time to separate the rookies from vets
Pussies from threats, truth and lies
Supplies from dealers and death
I'm feeling this, I'm young and ruthless
Status unmatched undisputed, some assuming
My destiny to rep these streets
I'm built for this
The will is too strong
Feelings numb from dealing too long
It's real count ya friends when you on
My pen is visual I'm real, men are miserable
I feel the tension growing
You hold a grudge, I'm 45 with infra holding, no love
Hungry like my ribs are showing, as if you didn't notice
I spit the potent, uncut raw my mind is pure ferocious
Like a shark I tear you open cuz you blood in my ocean
My pen it ghost people, like dope needles
When I rhyme there's no equal
The flow will freeze you, like Medusa stare I'm so lethal
Obvious I'm a vill, with odds against me
Like Rasheed Wallace its hard to stick me
I'm built for this
In the streets, I'm powerful if shit gets dirty
30-30 clips will shower, you exist cause I allow you to live
I conquered you, I kinda knew you was weak
I can see how cowards do
I write epic facing a scholar, question my life expectannce
My essence is getting money, my aura like Lexus
On the mic I'm relentless, pursuit of perfection
Ya new connect for pure, uncut raw - what
I caught a rush when ever my palms clutch a gun, pen or a ki
Or a dime satisfy my every need
I write rhymes with killer instinct, yet to find a nigga iller then me
Some smile at my face, yet they still against me
I detect the fake, never sleep or deny death for waste
Or conversate in the presence of snakes
When and where and time I'm measuring weight
You destined to think or where does he get this paper, son we nearly extinct
I realized that when burying spank, the real will perish ya life
Conceal evidence my rhyme skill is excellent
M - for the man
E - executioner
G - get money
A - all my niggas movin' up
I'm BUILT FOR THIS
For real its in me, like R. K I'll make you feel the big heat
The illest is me, the drug dealer MC, semi-auto I conceal on these streets
To uphold the kiss of death and try to deal ki's and snort blow
You can't replace me
I live the rhyme I visualize, you ain't real I see it in ya eyes
I spit nines, weight coke on scales that's digitized
The realness I live and die, the streets I epitomize the trife life
I rock jewels with ice, verbally I bruise mics
Mega live it I'm ghetto, my shit is chromed out
Give me a pen and watch a nigga zone out
I can't believe the shit I spit is from my own mouth[Hook]
What you reap, is what you sow
And what you keep, is what you owe
And what the people want to know is
Who's gonna catch the thrown?
And what you got, is what they want
And what they see, they sat they need
And people bleedin', from the greed
Now who's gonna catch the thrown?

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
Thrown at, thrown under
Thrown to the side
Throwing up disgusted, so we're throwin' down
Thrown under the bus draggin' on the ground
Power to the people salutin' the underground
Against those standing in mansions, spittin' down at us
From up their higher ground
Feed the people, fight the power, fix the poor
But that 1% done shut the door
In God we trust our money, it's a slap in the face
To the rest of the whole human race
Post racial wealth and taste, change a name
But you can't change race in the United States
People say they're kings, plus say they're queens
If we all don't eat, what does it all mean?
We watch and listen, but I'll leave it alone
But who's gonna catch the thrown?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chuck D w/ Flavor Flav as Hype]
Divide and conquer, the oldest trick in the game
Is the one between the people who are really the same
As the rich get richer, the poor get bitcin'
The people keep kissin', the feds don't listen
This recession's seen a black depression
Situation of a nation headed for desperation
No quaterback gets sacked on the couch
The sound of black America is ouch!
Governments don't love you and president executions
End up looking like some final solutions
Murder is an institution backed up and hacked up
By some handwritten, constitution
Do what you do! Buddhist, Christian, Hindu
Muslim and Hebrew, you're all what you do
I be seeing human beings that stew, yet
Never have so many been screwed by so few!
We watch the kings and queens and what they owe
But who's gonna catch the thrown?

[Other Hook]
There's a man
Going 'round
Takin' Names

[Verse 3: Cormega]
The system is designed to incriminate
Genocide was devised to eliminate
Equality is a myth!
They had me in jail for a crime I didn't even commit
A stereotype
They feel every color is inferior, right?
Brothers who resist are considered a threat
From Sitting Bull, to Malcolm X
In the land of the free, and suspect elections
John Kennedy had the mob connections
President Reagan sold guns to Iraq
Yet they try to say that criminals are all black
What's up with these corrupt politicians?
Them drugs they be shippin', but they never go to prison
This fucked up system better never try to bag me
Fuck Zimmerman, he's guilty, clearly!

[Bridge]
Catch the thrown!
You've got to testify
Is that the one percent that you need
Says that you occupy
Catch the thrown!
I've got to testify
Is that the one percent that ya'll want
You've got to occupy

[Other Hook]
There's a man
Going 'round
Taking names

[Verse 4: Chuck D w/ Flavor Flav as hype]
Free the mind prisoners, but they ain't listening
F tha po-po, but who dat whistling?
Foes making a killing, Juxtaposed against those givin' a livin'
Give me shelter, cause these issues be official
Is the need to feed replaced by the greed?
I ain't tryin' to yell at you or sell to you
Some B.S. they already told to you
End up being sold to you, did I mention?
The cheapest price is to pay attention
Now the test is just being at your best
With that you can hold your own
But who's gonna catch the thrown?

[Hook]

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Ay yo Chuck, I think we got this shit under wraps, son
Dun said, dun said, dun said
Let's get the F up outta here, man[Cormega]
Your ebony eyes is heavenly
You like a pearl handle, smooth yet deadly
Smile yo, your style so awesome, like Stoudemire
Crossin' over, lost 'em, you a cobra, I gotta use caution
Perfection, slide like the new GS's
A black butterfly floatin' in my direction
Check it, you and me is like graffiti on walls
You wanna see me, all you had to do was call
And I'll be there, like DEA if they think a ki is there
Yo, ma, I analyze every minute we share
You nice, like uptown Nike's, with powder blue stripes
How would you like, to go out and chill all night
No question, I represent the Q.B.C
But no doubt ma, but what's up with you and me
Yo, your conversation indicated educated
Situations elevated, when I smelled your fragrance

[Hook 2X: sample (Cormega)]
Sometimes it seems that way to live
(Type mysterious, like the mind behind pyramids)
I need you to love, don't you see
(Coco butter complexion, your eyes dead serious)

[Cormega]
I don't usually pursue women, I just did 'em
Your style, I jiggin', yo ma, how we livin'
What you like, drug dealer type, thugs, nice guys
I'm a real nigga, you seem to be likewise
You said I got nice eyes, nah, you incredible
Yo, what the deal, my name is Mega, boo
Aiyo, I came checkin' you cuz bangin' like soul food
I'm stressed in my Lex', you changed my whole mood
I was vexed, semi-depressed, thinkin' on things not worth
Speakin' on, laid back with Air Mac sneakers on
You was movin' so smoothly, your style confusin' me
Mentally abuse me, excuse me, can we connect?
Go to my rest, select a movie to check
I don't got a jacuzzi, but I bet you leave wet
You a goddess, I'm tryin' my hardest
Yo the rims on my ride be retarded, when they gleamin' in your projects

[Hook 2X]

[Cormega]
Yo, you remind me of coco butter, your conversation
Don't even come close to others
You got knowledge indeed, word, you got to college in Queens
Your intellect is like bail in Kew Gardens Supreme
Can you please be a part of my team?
I shoot my cream like gun powder, and 9 months you proud of my seed
You acknowledge my dream to live on, I conquered your seat
Yo, boo, you know the drilly on how real it could be

[Hook 2X][Cormega]
What up son? It's Mega
Tony Touch, what the deal dunn-dunn
Yo yo yo yo yo
When I die remember me for fly jewels, nines, and Hennessy
Tropical weed, Rovers, Beamers, Infinitis
Dun, I'mma drop it, consider me a ghetto prophet (why?)
I could write trife or recite a mellow topic (true)
In the streets, I had to maintain self
Son I packed enough heat to make thermometers melt
The trife life, I seen a lot of faces I hated
I exist in a cypher where drug dealers are livin' it
More niggas are prisoned nowadays, we livin' fouler ways
The whole hood is in a marijuana daze
I know the power of a dollar saved
Son I'm young, but I'm out for the cash the old-timers crave
Back in the day dope king, sweeter than Aliz√©
Now it take forever and a day
I used to measure grams, but now I got better plans
Drivin a fuckin' Navigator in the desert sands
I never ran and never will, get outta hand and Mega will
Send a missle at your chest and mad red'll spill
Cuz I'm exalted from words spoken cautious
Seen some other bigger drug dealer blowin fortunes
In back rooms, niggas be sniffin like vaccuums
Reminisce to '88, the year crack ruled
They had Nike Delta Forces pumpin' clear capsules
Five for forty, had fiends like "I only rob for shorty"
My story real than yours, imaginated, fabricated
I'm Mega Montana, drama and retaliation, what nigga what?
BIOTCH! Ha ha ha[Cormega]
Yo.. yeah shit is real right now yaknahmsayin?
Who the nigga - motherfuckin Cormega
Queensbridge, that's Q.B
Uptown - Connecticut, niggas is settin it
Tone Touch - you just don't give a fuck
What nigga?  Far Rock', Iraq, to Southside
Son we gon' show these niggas

Yo, yo, what?
Niggas recognize the method I perfected rhymin
Rappers insecure, verbally I'm jeapordizin
Check the way that I be exercisin
My pen work for me for years, it's ?-defyin (ooh!)
You know the saga, the drama
The Queensbridge Kingpin, 'Mega Montana
To Touch I pledge allegiance, drugs sold for many reasons
Some for prestige, others they only way of eatin (no doubt)
My niggas pray to be in, a better life
We had plans to bag grams and get ahead at night (what?)
I fuck with officialist, thugs that hit you wit
Cop killer dum-dum shit, your whole shit is split
Livin this life, drippin in ice (uh)
Holdin my position like pimpin, Friday composition
Trife uhh I'm takin mines like in Perry Mason times
Any attempt to stop me (check this) you wastin times
I could blaze a nine or infilitrate the line between paper
Rhymes like solidified white rock, shocked in eighty-nine
Rhyme for FEMA's, ??, overachievers
Hold a heater to them other cultures, who deceive us
Blunted on a wanted poster with a golden millimeter
You think it ain't real?  Check me on my next re-up, BEOTCH!

What nigga?  Who could fuck with this?
What?  Hahahah
Mobb Deep, C-N-N nigga, Shan
Nas nigga, Poet, Kamikaze, Killa Kid
Nature, what?  Q-B nation nigga
Back together, ha ha..
