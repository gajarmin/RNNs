She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be counting up, watch how far them bands go
Hop out my beamer, she jump out the Lambo
Roll them bands up, smooth how the wind go
Dumping wood guts allout the window
Married to the money, I ain’t never let go

Ay, where the gold at, baby?
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?
Ay, where the dough at, baby?
And the banger but you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)
Ay, we gon' save that money
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on them
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L, The Jew Biz Major?
Fuck you know about the world he was raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away
Book flight December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get login's for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thotties, I disregard them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin', preacher
I can take his ass church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burb like a baby without no hiccup
I can...

[Interlude]
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know a full verse would have been to expensive anyways
I think

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie
Hair cut several months in-between, homie
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave, homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Air B&B the mother fucker, least I'm never there
I'm not in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it
401k rollin' over bands on it
Coppin' sweaters in the summer with the sail on it
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpay for it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count, hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shiz though
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin finch tho
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Kept the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Fetty Wap]
Everytime these niggas tryna play
And lately I've been stackin' up
Cause I'm bout the bands baby
100k underneath the bed baby

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing a long like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you
Than it need be, so think about it take a minute let it breathe B
But think about it bruh you saw me take the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp up in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kyke know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that [snicker]
You didn't... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed[Hook: Monty]
My niggas about the cash
I'm driving something fast
Girl you got all that ass

Ain't worried bout these hoes
These bitches ain't bad as some
[x2]

[Verse 1: Monty]
Girl you got all that ass, what you gon' do with that?
I heard you tryna fuck, you know I'm cool with that
And you know you can catch me where the shootas at
Ain't worried bout these bitches bae, I'm thru with that

And they know how we roll
Bad bitches, I keep those

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]

She pulling down my pants like you a monster, let's go

I'll die before I tell it
My dick dope bitch, I should sell it
My dope loud, bitch, you can smell it
Kill a nigga and celebrate
Get the yellow and the red tape
Drop a nigga like a mixtape
And we plan it, premeditate (yeah, baby)
AK's chop shit, call 'em sensei
Pop a fuck nigga and then pray
God forgive me for my sins please
Exit bigger than the entry
I won't stop till my clip empty

To wake up in the morning is a motherfucking blessing

You gon see the king of diamonds, prince of diamonds standing next to him

Man that’s a mistake, that shit’s so dumb, why you so fucking foolish?
Diamonds crystal clear, my shits on burr, my shits is looking bluish

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Montana Bucks]
Just to wake up in the morning is a blessing
Won’t catch me slipping cause I keep that Smith & Wesson

Give ‘em eight, then I skate like the Jetsons, ay
All this bread I’m investing, ay

Riding with the pistol, shit got dirty plates

[Hook]

Nigga, ooh I be ducking
Smoking eighths of the indo, she too cute
And I’m paid so as the wind blow, she do too
Make it rain for the hell of it, purple haze, love the smell of it
Off a plane, I’m propelling it, off a plane, I’m propelling it

Got my pistols with my robot taking pics ho

This is why I do it by your house, I’m filling bags too
Don’t you worry ‘bout a thing, girl I got you ‘cause I have to

Don’t want none of them bitches, they corny, they out here clueless
When I tell you I got you, you know it’s real, I gotta do it
Here’s a king, you should move it, I’m the one you influenced

It ain’t nothing to grab the Glock and that shot, they call me Pippen

[Hook]

I know bigger homies nigga, I know homies you should know
I done been to Cali nigga, I done smoked the finest dope
I done smoked about ten pounds and sold a million pills
Remember days on the back block, we stashed the bricks in cribs

My favorite rapper Gucci Guwop a.k.a. that’s mister perfect
Bitch, they call me Fetty ZooWap a.k.a. I’m mister swerving
Hundred grams, I hit a doowop off the block ‘cause I was serving
And I build it Dennis Rodman minus one where I was working
And your bitch, she want the dick and I can tell ‘cause she be flirting
All I know is get it in, I sold them skinnies for a thirty
And don’t talk about them pistols ‘cause Fetty Cash come out and hurt ya

I ain’t saying I was rich but big ZooWap could afford it
Now my money longer, I rock robins and jordans
And I know these niggas mad two pairs of jeans their apartment
Where the fuck was ya’ll at when big ZooWap was starving
Had to make it happen, twenty niggas in an apartment
I ain’t had no fucking help, I put that on my mama
LB got me in the trap, every day it was harder
Started serving every day, then, my sack got larger
Remy Boyz, niggas know we making it harder
Bag mounds of work, send the shit way farther
I be in the trap tryna keep my eyes open
DA fucked up tryna throw the trial on me
Gotta watch for the fuck niggas tryna plot on me
Got the drop from his bitch, say he tryna ride on me
He deserves to slowly die with his eyes wide open
He deserves to slowly die with his eyes wide open
Pull up on these niggas, start to swerving
Ay, Remy Boyz, niggas know it perfect
Ay I’m scoring on these niggas, Steve Kerr
Ay, baby I ain’t even got insurance
