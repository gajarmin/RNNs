Ay yo, you ready?
Let's do it
Mm, yeah
Yeah, c'mon

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
I'm the definition of "half man, half drugs"
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wussup
After bucks, crush crews after us
No games, we ain't laughing much
Nothing but big things, check the hitlist
How we twist shit, what changed but the name?
We still here, you rockin' with the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks (Ha!)
Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think cause I'm iced out, I'mma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me
Get it right, dawg, we ain't ever left
We just moved in silence and repped to the death
It's official, I survive what I been through
Y'all got trauma, the saga continues

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Verse 2: Black Rob]
Hey yo straight from the Harlem streets
I don't play, I push it down with the Harlem Heat
All a sudden niggas got a problem wit me
They run around actin like the Black-o can't eat
And you know what? For some strange reason
I'm off of this medication, feeling deranged needing
For y'all to put the word out, we ain't leavin'
We trying to be rich before we all stop breathing
Therefore we kinda hustle lames
Stay laying down our muscle games
Still turn niggas dreams to flames, you got the wire
If not I ain't sayin no names; you'll soon expire
No pain, nothing, I feel remorse
Yes of course it's me and Diddy up first racing Porsches
With the big twin valve exhausts
On the cover of your Vibes, XXLs, and Sources, bitch

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Verse 3: Mark Curry]
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah
It ain't shit changed, since the Notorious
See everything still glorious
We still got warriors, still be the victorious
See it's a lot of them, but it's more of us
Still got cash to blow, raps to flow
Still them cats that know, pack yo' flow
That's fo' sho', bottles that pop, joints that rock
Played the background, hand on my jock, holdin' my Glock
Money to get, cars to flip
Bars to sit at and sip Cognac wit jewels that drip
Hoes to see, make sure they knowin' it's me
Drop that beat, can't believe that I MC
Bad boy 'til the casket drop, gotta love it
Place nothing above it, it's on like that
Don't believe, we ain't gone like that
We're always gonna be here
We there every motherfucking year!

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Outro: P. Diddy]
Bad boy.. we ain't goin' nowhere
Uh-huh, uh-huh, what?
We ain't goin nowhere
We gon' stay right here
For ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, c'mon
We ain't goin nowhere, we gon' stay right here
We ain't goin nowhere, we gon' stay right here
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Cause it's bad boy for life![Intro - Puff Daddy]
I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had 24 hours to live, what would you do?
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

[Verse 1 - Mase]
Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gonna play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gonna be here tomorrow, so what

[Verse 3 - Black Rob]
You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare Spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one of them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Pause, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, get them cats I wanted to get
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in '86
Went home took a shower in ice cold water
And spent my last hours with my son and my daughter

[Hook - Puff Daddy]
If you had 24 hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would your ass deny that your ass about to die?

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Sheek]
What hey yo, if I had 24 nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papis' spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty and he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a book bag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller with the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to 23, I'mma be strapped with TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges with me

[Verse 5 - Styles]
If I had 24 hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin' the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the 24 I make it out the precinct
Shootin' niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

[Verse 6 - DMX]
24 left until my death
So I'm gonna waste a lot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

[Hook]Intro: Mariah Carey & Puff Daddy

Oh, oh
Honey got me hooked on you
I like that, uh
I thought I told you
That we won't stop
Ooh, ooh (Come on)

Verse 1: The Lox, Black Rob, Mariah Carey

All the money in the world couldn't even amount
To a teaspoon of honey that'll melt in your mouth (That's right)
It's The Lox and Mariah you know you check'n this out
You know they deal a few meals every time she come out
With her blown
And us flown
There ain't nuthin left for us to talk about
But a whole lot of doe

And every current affiar

Keepin' your hands in the air
Like we just don't care (Come On)
Don't be a lier
Would you change your attire (MC)
Get a bomb like Hillshire
Wit the honey like Mariah
Sceam to the ranch then ride a horse
Then come back to the city pushin' a Rolls Royce

Honey you can have me
When you want me
You simply ask me to be there (a huh)
And you're the only one
Who makes me come running
Cause what you got
Is far beyond compare, ooh

Chorus: Mariah Carey

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (That's right)
Oh baby I've got a dependancy
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey (Uh huh)
When it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you
Crying for you
I adore you
Boy you know your love addected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day
I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside (yeah, yeah)
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside

Verse 2: Mariah Carey

Yeah, ooh
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey (I like that)
Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
You're the only thing I wanna do

Chorus: Mariah Carey

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependancy
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey

Verse 3: Mase, Mariah Carey

You know Mase huff, We Puff
We blow your house down
Bring that Harlem world sound
Directly to your town, In fact
This is why I act like that
I ain't dropped one single
And I made this money back
I rock so swell, I gotta prevail
First rap superstar dominating pop sales
You never wish me well cause it start to sell
And it land me with pretty women in the Swiss hotel
And girls that mean a lot
I get em from the shop
Buy them everything they got
From the jeans to the watch
You wanna be my misses
You gotta meet me wanna spoil you with my bitches
And you could tell that Mase is real
Cause he do real things
And I make things thats average look real mean
When it comes to sex I got the real thing
So when you cover your mouth they could hear you still scream

Baby I can love you babe
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah you're on fire)
Gotta hold on love thy saints
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah take us higher)
Ooohh
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah you're on fire)
Ooohh
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah take us higher)

(Breakdown)
Oooh, woah (Yeah)

(Now what we gonna do right here, we gonna smooth it out, come on)
Ooh, woah, honey, got me hooked on you
(MC, and she won't stop)
Honey, it's like

Chorus: Mariah Carey

Honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you

Boy you know your love addected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day

For another taste of honey

Repeat til fade[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh.. UHH
Yeah..
Uhh.. uhh..
Uh! Yeah.. yeah..
Uhh..

Fuck em.. yeah, uhh..
With my hands gripped.. praise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her.. (dump her body, dump her body) sewer
Our father.. uh-huh..

What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uhh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake

Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 2X)

With my hands gripped.. praise the Lord shit
Our father.. if I should die before I wake

[Black Rob]
Fluck that
Snap a nigga shit, smash him with the fifth, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the Glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher; mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers -- see Biggie Smalls
Recruited these snipers -- alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm
Paralyzin my niggas thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, hop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch nigga.. whoah..

Chorus

[Beanie Sigel]
Yo when you fuckin wit Mac, you fuckin wit the best
Still going to war with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S.K. can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggas get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin bleedin -- from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggas start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
Or I sick two pits to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin the brick, facin that shit
Takin two sniffs, grabbin my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggas takin some shit
Picture niggas takin my shit

Chorus

[Ice Cube]
Niggas never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
In the year 2000, all drunk and pissy
Off whiskey, you can miss me, actin gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L.A
Doin it the O.G. way; it's sorta like
The Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
The Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine, and seperate yo' head from yo' spine
So, "Grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop" and
Fuck you niggas that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy, of this nation, for assassination
Of the young black male in this black hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather
That you and 2Pac got yo' shit together
California Love

Chorus[Black Rob - almost mumbling]
They said that I'm a Rottweiler
And I'm from the Rottweiler house
The Rottweiler New York

[G-Dep]
Really, get smacked silly, you get smacked silly
Fucking with these niggas from the, what you gon' do
When you ready? Shit I was born ready
And I was already on fish and spaghetti
Creep with the culture, rap I can coach ya
Attack like a vulture, see what I told ya?
Said I'd get'cha, wear it if it fit ya
Y'all thirteen inches, I see the big picture
If it's to get richer, I'd probably get wit ya
If not burn it, get hot like a furnace
Shoot the video, motherfuck city permits
We own the city, on the phone with Diddy (*phone sounds*)
Red bone pretty, when she get aroused
Like to suck her own titty; put it in the video
Ya wanna holla got to follow nigga here we go
Get you ticket, the train, don't miss it
Won't reach out, and ya bet I won't visit
'til my whole wardrobe is-it, now listen

(Chorus)
Make this money, take this money (Let's get it)
Ain't no way you can take this from me (Let's get it)
Ain't shit funny (uh) shake it honey (Let's get it)
Take it money.. now let's get it (Let's get it)

[G-Dep]
Creep with your people
Though my shit is Sweet and Low it's no Equal
Front but you lookin
Once I throw the hook in proceed to get cookin
With the game when I sewed it
Since you came thought I owed you one
Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him
With my man's type proper
Better learn quick, cause my clique don't argue
You ain't my crew, who are you? Beat it
'fore we take off make sure you all seated
In Billboard read it, believe it

(Chorus)

[G-Dep]
Soul Controller, rap Ayatollah
Kids hate me when they older I put cracks by the stroller
I'm registered voter, motherfuck a quota
Give some bakin soda and a quarter
Bet I flow straight up out the water
I'mma wreck the game 'til it say "out of order"
Put the high score up
Then tear the floor up
On the world tour with your whore out in Europe
Head on the tour bus
Do what them niggas in the drop thinks cooler
Called up five reporters to thank my supporters
Hittin wives and daughters
Brought 'em neck spray from Estee Lauders
Call Puffy to order

[P-Diddy]
Aiyyo, call me Diddy - I run this city
Send the cops, the D.A. and feds to come get me
Cats wanna leave me for dead you comin with me
Gettin head in the Bentley red at one fifty
Straight lose it, love two things my family my music
Might co-write and produce it
Drop mine, hot 9 exclusive
Got y'all Hawkin like Yusef
Cause I can, break backs and stacks it's no problem
Make raps and tracks and go Harlem
I get worldwide coverage
Got so many spots I don't even buy luggage, ya love it
Make moves major, hide out in Asia
If your girl keep comin around them I'm a blaze her
I'm the Bad Boy flavor, light blue gators
NOT GUILTY, and I'm filthy, c'mon

(Chorus)

[Black Rob (Puffy)]
I be the Eastside Soprano, Rob Marciano
Flow in e'ry channel with the Iverson handle
Forty-five sparks turn your day gray flannel
Snatch the yay of the mantle, then proceed to dismantle
Can't slay Rob
How many niggas done tried to play Rob, quit they day job
Tired of putting broke niggas under the wing
If I go to jail again I'm goin under the bing
Act like you gon' pull that thing thing
You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling
I represent "A" block in Sing Sing
Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen
Moves for paper, booze no chaser
Bullets out the blazer four-fifth with the laser
Come and get your shit splitted, newspapers said I did it
(He ain't do it) Now let's get it (Let's get it)

(Chorus) (x3)(I'll always be there for you)
[Puff] Yeah
(I'll never betray you)
[Puff] Mmm, mmm, mmm
(I love you baby)
[Puff] I love you baby

Verse One: Black Rob

I met her Uptown on Dyckman, aight then
Talkin that, how she only dealt with businessmen
Niggas baggin joints, money off and on the books
The ones who stand firm like ain't, nuttin shook
About them, I doubt them cats waitin for me
You know them niggas, them big dudes across the street
She say, "Yeah, they from over on Mayfair"
Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out
This bitch over there with them pointin the chief out
They want beef out here, they gon' get it
In the worst way, I'mma show em how Black play
Roll the dice, fuckin with me is like snake eyes
I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise
It's all about the Benjamins, true that be the motto
Ran out of ammo and started, throwin bottles
Runnin, and I ain't lookin back for shit
Crooked ass bitch, today I get you back for this
(I'll get you back)

Chorus: repeat 2X

I love you baby No you don't
You drive me crazy That's right
I'll never betray thee Uhh
I love you baby C'mon

Verse Two: Black Rob (starts rapping during the chorus)

Yo since the last altercation I been on the street
Seein honey at the club every week and not speak
I'mma rock that ass to sleep before I strike
I ain't know the real deal until last night
How, one of them brothers was locked with Babe Bro
Used to call my crib from C-Seventy-Four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the jack
Babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl
Youse about to get fucked with no gel
I'mma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin
And plan your extermination, word

Chorus

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

It took a while to peep your style, Miss I-B-M-workin
Low profile single, house in Staten Island
And Manhattan while, them same cats
You sent to get me boo, is on they to get you
Fuckin witchu, that small time crack dealin nigga
He a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too
Shit's real, you think you gonna set me up
And get away scot free without some type of injury
Nah kill it, I'mma flip the script on you
Same thing you did to me, I'mma do it to you
Who knew she was the female Rambo
Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans and
In the end, she had to be the Last Bitch Standin
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong
Just like that she was gone, now it's over
Assumin I'll go back to my everyday life
Of a rich millionaire just rockin the mic
Gotta pause, and think about honey no doubt
And admire how the chick went out

Chorus: repeat to fade[Intro - Puff Daddy]
I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had 24 hours to live, what would you do?
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure

With those bricks in a book bag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller with the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to 23, I'mma be strapped with TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges with me

[Verse 5 - Styles]
If I had 24 hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin' the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the 24 I make it out the precinct
Shootin' niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

[Verse 6 - DMX]
24 left until my death
So I'm gonna waste a lot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

[Hook][P. Diddy]
This is not America
Bad Boy baby, David Bowie, let's go

[Hook: David Bowie]
This is not America
This is not America
This is not America
This is not America

[P. Diddy]
Land where my father died, land where my children cried
Come on, America, ain't no barriers
Free the strings, let's see how freedom rings
One nation all gettin' down for the dollars
And the heat is gettin' hotter
But a lot don't understand
Just the way some plan to break you
I done seen the whole thing go straight through
Hungry for it, I'mma make you
Pay back what's due to me
Everybody gonna see, look what they put upon me
Made me a monster, two steps beyond ya
More streets to wonder
For which it stands for cause let's get it
Cause I'mma get mine for damn sure, come on

[Loon]
Screens, greens car candy painted
Chicks in cream is the American dream, ain't it?
I pledge allegiance to Beamers, dark skies
Sleepless nights on the block, two for fives
Deep in the struggles but need the hustle
Weed and blow shit I make the block bubble
I'm to the point where I'm playa hatin'
Fool in the stash and I'm losin' my patience
Medieval times in the chest of the beast
Come around sniffin' I'mma mess up ya fleece
Job lookin' I'd rather be pot cookin'
It's not America, son this is Brooklyn
Home of the shiesty, home of the crook
We signed joints, ain't scared to do a took
My country tis of thee, where there's no liberty
Just misery, ya heard me

[Hook]

[Kain]
Now why can't I breathe with a gun and come free
If six dead people run this country
Now they come cause my crew's too large
Who the fuck put chu' in charge
Runnin' around here like you is God
Then they wonder why the shootin' starts
Gettin' checks with half my stacks
I forgot George Bush wrote half my raps
Murderin' people for blastin' facts
Then blamin' other cats for their tragic acts
I'm tryin' to get paid till my eyes is closin'
Cops is like freeze and I'm already frozen
So they clap and they brawl in hysteria
Tappin' Jackson callin' this area
Green gots cats crawlin' to bury ya
Don't blame Kain for the fall of America

[Hook]

[Mark Curry]
Uh, yo what about these streets here
Before y'all creep here
Look around we there
365 days a year
Lines to cross no fear
And what appears to be roses
See I'm knowin' this
When I chose this
What's right
In broad day or night
More dope deals
I'm tryin' to stay on my heels
Every day's training day
Some things not in explainin' ways
Who said crimes don't pay
Choices to make
Ain't too many chances left to take
Things look so green
The sign of the times corruption politics, youg ones dyin'
What you made of
Either hate or love
Pressure on the nine when push come to shove

[Hook]

[David Bowie]
A little piece of you (I'm ya worst nightmare)
A little peace in me
A little piece of you (This is not America)
A little peace in me
Will go

[Hook]

[Black Rob]
Yo, why you cocksuckers pullin' me over
Racial profilin' me cause I ain't pushin' no Nova
I'm up to par lookin'
I know police corruption is up this year and y'all crooked
Took my hard white
Had niggas sellin' the same block, pumpin' the same night
Arrest me, come to court and lie
Yeah that's him, pointin' like I'm the guy
What chu' want those is me of the block
Yo, so you can serve fiends everytime they knock
Just last summer had the mad Hummer
They took that and didn't even give me they badge number
So how am I supposed to feel
Who I'm supposed to call when the shit gets real
Word man I'd rather dial 8-1-1 when it's important
Plus they ain't tryin' to score like Ed Norton, word

[Hook to fade][Intro: P. Diddy]
Ay yo, you ready?
Let's do it
Mm, yeah
Yeah, c'mon

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
I'm the definition of "half man, half drugs"
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wussup
After bucks, crush crews after us
No games, we ain't laughing much
Nothing but big things, check the hitlist
How we twist shit, what changed but the name?
We still here, you rockin' with the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks (Ha!)
Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think cause I'm iced out, I'mma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me
Get it right, dawg, we ain't ever left
We just moved in silence and repped to the death
It's official, I survive what I been through
Y'all got trauma, the saga continues

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Verse 2: Black Rob]
Hey yo straight from the Harlem streets
I don't play, I push it down with the Harlem Heat
All a sudden niggas got a problem wit me
They run around actin like the Black-o can't eat
And you know what? For some strange reason
I'm off of this medication, feeling deranged needing
For y'all to put the word out, we ain't leavin'
We trying to be rich before we all stop breathing
Therefore we kinda hustle lames
Stay laying down our muscle games
Still turn niggas dreams to flames, you got the wire
If not I ain't sayin no names; you'll soon expire
No pain, nothing, I feel remorse
Yes of course it's me and Diddy up first racing Porsches
With the big twin valve exhausts
On the cover of your Vibes, XXLs, and Sources, bitch

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Verse 3: Mark Curry]
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah
It ain't shit changed, since the Notorious
See everything still glorious
We still got warriors, still be the victorious
See it's a lot of them, but it's more of us
Still got cash to blow, raps to flow
Still them cats that know, pack yo' flow
That's fo' sho', bottles that pop, joints that rock
Played the background, hand on my jock, holdin' my Glock
Money to get, cars to flip
Bars to sit at and sip Cognac wit jewels that drip
Hoes to see, make sure they knowin' it's me
Drop that beat, can't believe that I MC
Bad boy 'til the casket drop, gotta love it
Place nothing above it, it's on like that
Don't believe, we ain't gone like that
We're always gonna be here
We there every motherfucking year!

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Outro: P. Diddy]
Bad boy.. we ain't goin' nowhere
Uh-huh, uh-huh, what?
We ain't goin nowhere
We gon' stay right here
For ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, c'mon
We ain't goin nowhere, we gon' stay right here
We ain't goin nowhere, we gon' stay right here
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Cause it's bad boy for life![Hook]
B.L.A.C.K.R.O.B

I got a, freaky, freaky, freaky lil flow
Lock the town like Fidel Castro
Went straight to jail, did not pass go
(Aiyyo Black can we ask you a question?), no
Now back to live action, dust my shoulders off on this track, I'm just practicing
And I ain't even at my maximum, imagine if I was, this is for the love
Ladies and gentlemen, kids of all ages
You're about to go on a ride with the wild and outrageous
So buckle your seatbelts, my heat's felt
All in the ghetto, the dominator, Darth Vader creator
Officializing, signed and sealed, dot delivered
Minute, if he don't get no bigger
We never left, naw, we took a break off
You all tucked in? We about to take off

[Hook]

Now there's a rumor being spread about me and the team
And a couple wild brothers outta 115
Y'all might not have heard it, some cat got murdered
Now everybody walking around all shady nervous
I ain't sweatin that, bout to do a show in San Antonio
(Then what?), then fly back home
I calls guy on the phone, they had a car at the airport
Somethin with a chick chaffeur, butt naked in the full length fur
It's on and popping, work it baby ain't no stopping
Bad Boy is in the building, honeys catching feeling
Now we rated number one, now, sales through the ceiling
People had faith in Rob
I'm on that and run the point like Jason [Kidd], god
It's one thing to be all hood
I guess its safe to say, (what?), so far so good
Black

[Hook]

Downtown we winding down, last call for alcohol
Scoop up your girl
You've never seen this before, that's a Bentely Four
Fresh out the store, this should be against the law
Party don't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Hit the bootlegger, pint of Rock
And I'm a get smart through the hollerin
Long as she doin less talkin and more swallowin
Now Black is what they hollerin out in the east
How he won't go away like permanent crease
And this is how I murder the streets
A lotta dudes is mad when I'm just trying to get a bite to eat
I dont care if yall just two-step to do the hustle
This is New York rapping, bring me some New York muscle
See me in the club, its nothin but love
Love the way I position myself to rise above
Black

[Hook]

One more time baby

[Repeat Hook]Black rob, BR
Black rob, BR

I am about to set the record straight (the world's famous)
Its 99 man time to let them know man

Verse One:
Yo aiyo yo yo
Its kill or be killed
My skillz leavin them chilled on ice
Like twice when I flash my steel
They can't touch
Won't touch
Never touch
Driving around with the toastly whip, never bust
Puffin dust like fiends
I mean I want green ya shifty
Cop the big eight fifty with the gleam
My team
Full of cut throats with enough notes to write a fuckin book
Take a good fucking look at these bad guys
Stay madd fly, madd high
In the ford expidie and I don't expect to die
On some humble shit
I am on some rumble shit
When it's on you should see the shit I come through with
If you scared by dog release the four by fours
I heard the fagot ass Don died and he shit in his draws
On the streets black good like allstate ya all fake
Just got paid but fuck it I want some more cake
Ya faith, in my hand
Now ya nervous man and drive my brains quick fast at ya service
My brother Curtis squezze gats to celliums
I make it where you can't escape the parra bedlums
I tell some, live ya life like Puff did
I did enough biz ask anybody I'm rough kid

Chorus:
Black Rob We Are
Black Rob uh-uh
Black Rob We Are
Black Rob uh-uh
Black Rob We Are
Black Rob uh-uh
Black Rob We Are
Black Rob

Verse Two: G-Dep
Yo, yo
I put a finger in the air
For the hearing impaired
If you're hearin this fear
Than your hearing it cleared
Man I fuck with bod, got put on the job
Don't question it to stars, I'mma put'em in saw
Straight gate
I suggest you vacate
When I shake, they feel earthquakes in eight states
Oh trait, off the Richter, drunk
Off the liquor
Shot towards you mister
Off course it hit you hard
It gets hard, I pick the card
Any card any problem I'mma hit your squad
Eyes on the shapar when I twisted god
You think you got it all together
Get it ripped apart
Man you can't stand the heat
Stay up outta the street
Nigga turn po-lice cause they shot up his jeep
I subtract like mad
Don't make me blad
So I want it all, fuck had
Don't make me laugh
By all means
Get this money its all green
It's all good
And I wished that ya'll would
Man fuck that, security told ya to tuck that
Now up that, now that you see where lux at
I got the game by the balls
And I get all calls
So if u play to much I put the shit on pause

Bad Boy
Bad Boy[Hook]
Father dear (I know you wanna touch me)
Well if you hear me (You know you wanna touch me)
I've been.. father dear (You know you wanna kiss me)
Well if you hear me (I want you to kiss me)
I've been.. father dear (I know you wanna fuck me)
Well if you hear me (Why can't you love me?)
I've been held, closely by a stranger

[Verse 1: Labba]
We came to give love to our die harded real bitches
That stick through they man through the bullshit and
Good loving and good fucking all night long
What makes a young killer feel strong, you know
You ain't from black thongs to black stem hope, you know
With a lifestyle bigger than don knockers
With a left hand body guard like John Rocker
Kill the cracker, you served pain but that didn't stop ya
Offered the money, gotsta prosper
Blame me for the babies we kill, ain't that ill
I'm the one who wants to go to hell with it
And 'em, I can kinda self finish

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ilacoin]
She moved above the law, 50 G's in the floor
Type to bring Whitney a key right to her door
Wife of a drug lord, living the China white
If you got her high enough, you could fuck her with a stick of dynamite
Tie her up, smack her butt, have your way
I met her Wednesday had that by Saturday
She was half black, born in Seoul Korea
Raised in an orphanage, the men would often come to see her
The nuns didn't stop the soldiers from raping her
Which is why she had panic attacks like Kim Bassinger
Months went by, I heard she put base in her stogs
Lit it with a stove, stole all her grace and her soul
I saw it in her face, she was losing control, confusing her role
Her cash flow disintegrated like her ass, yo
She fell victim, to the Rotten Apple
Say goodbye to the Porsche, kingpin wants a divorce
She was diagnosed with cancer, heard it from the Source
Now she wonders from, manger to manger, looking to be held

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Black Rob]
Saw me running through, gun inside the face
Goose saw what the struggle do
I mean you act like your fake friends is loving you
They undress in front of me and I'm uncomfortable
Figure I'll just come to you, try to confide
But then I start thinking 'bout the last time you lied
Boo, don't care what you got to hide
What I saw burned my eyes like chloride
All I wanna know is why, I wasn't even tryna spy
Come home dice from Bed-Stuy all inside
Shoulda known, all you did was was pull me down
I shoulda grown, canceled the mortgage on the home
Dead, the diva bust the cellular phone
I let you roam but now I gots to leave you alone
Harsh reality is the case, like when you spit in the wind
It might come back in your face
I just came to get my shit, no anger
You was the one kissing a stranger

[Hook][Intro: Jadakiss]
Uh yeah, yeah, what what, yeah yeah, yeah, what, yeah, what
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo this is a monopoly, niggas ain't stoppin' me
And we can't lose cuz Puff set us up properly
Just won't settle for lesser, who wanna test us
We be in the 5 with the goose headrests
LOX put niggas under pressure
You shoulda knew that, it's always them new cats that'll get ya
Better start looking at things from my angle
I'm trying to be up on the board with a triangle
Next to my name with a ten or a twenty
Now that's when you really can say you getting money
But right now all I do is sit back and listen
To a wise young man that quickly became a rich one
Put me up on the fact that it ain't hard to get some
Chips if I just keep writing with ambition
Then I get an advance from the five to the six and
House with two kitchens, diamonds, plenty women
Built-in pool to swim in
But the plan is to start from the floor and raise it up
Then you hit em in the head 'til your days is up
You blazing what, playboy you frail and butt
You know when Bad Boy drops, all your sales is cut

[Hook: Black Rob]
Can I Live, no one man can stop me
Can I Live, no front-line can block me
Can I Live, its enough base for all of us
Can I Live, without the names they calling us
Can I Live, no one man can stop me
Can I Live, no front-line can block me
Can I Live, or do I gatta bring it to these kids
Can I Live, if I don't live nobody live

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Time is money, money is power so I'm sour
22 feeling like I've wasted every hour
Of my life, shoulda been had a million in ice
High as a kite, feeling the flight, turbulence
Once in a blue moon I had a dream of fly shit
Hanglide to the Alps with this fly chick
Condo in Fresno with the lesbo
And the honey that she hit know how to stretch blow
They know that I'm Styles they respect the flow
Why don't y'all let a nigga live and help him make a decimal
Truth will set you free what will a lie do
Niggas say I'm God but I be gettin' high too
Can't love the money like the niggas beside you
Cause when the paper gone, you gon' slide too
Niggas wanna ball, but got to fall to rise
While the world spins around they wanna stall they eyes
Close they ears my nose makes me oppose my fear
Cuz I can smell hell
Before I sell rat I'll catch a shell farewell
Niggas will never tell
Their man that I was pussy
Unless they got a gun, and I ain't got one, I might let you push me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sheek]
I pray to God to promise me, before I see the pearly gates
To let my whole team be straight, mansion no Section 8
Putting pressure so that I can make this bed
Got two mattresses now all I need is the spread
With like four pillows so my seeds can rest their heads
You think platinum is enough, nah Sheek want more
Trying to sell more than Tickle me Elmo in the store
Italian cuisine, Linguin while my diamonds like-SHING
So when I move at night-time you might think it's light-NING
Just throw me the ball once and I'll tell you no lie
Shiek gonna show you money, like Jerry McGuire
It's a thug thing, LOX product thing, conducting
Anything for chips while you sit and blab your lips
In the restaurant taking tips while Sheek on trips
Logos on our ships bustin' at the eclipse
While im pissy, spittin' up Crissy in the water
But you can do that for money, when 100's like a quarter

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Black Rob]
This is to my AK totas, money bill foldas
Bambin soldiers, whips wit big motors
On the low for years, the Feds can't decode us
We bust rounds, all you gotta do is load us
My night time prowlers, and grimey after hours
Karl Kani, Mumalo wear, Eddie Bauers
Flippin cake niggas, who strip and take niggas
Upstate niggas, my Crystal Lake niggas
We gonna hold it down if we gotta shake niggas
And make niggas do what we say, or break niggas
Survival of the fittest, it ain't me cause I did it
Now you see me shinin 2 mill with my diamonds
And I owe it all to hard grindin
Don't mean I'm gonna stop climbin, 9-9, it's good timin
I salute my thugs, who rock
With the drugz and switch gunz, and pay 30 thou for the slum
Make it happen, I swear to God if I don't make it rappin
I'm clappin, extortin, and robbin niggz cribs and contactin
Can I live

[Hook](http://reviewz.simplenet.com/jointz/lox-rob_chain.ram)

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, what the fuck?

[Sheek]
L.O.X. baby
Sheek Louch, Jadakiss, Styles too
Black Rob, what the fuck, all up in this motherfucker

[Jadakiss]
Bad boy
Stay back, nigga

[Sheek]
Ay yo, if it ain't G's you stuffin' in my pocket
Nigga stop it
That bullshit you talking go reherse that at Rockets
Puff lye I pay dues, that nigga with a tattoo
The thin Ha, these motherfuckers gonna watch the Little
Rascals
When I say I bust my shit, believe it all the way
And the summer times where the Chochas show where one in her leg
If you could walk still, every block in Yonkers be hot still
With miners that will bust you down faster than cops kill
Niggas still front and step to you, falsely accused
That they just shot and you can still be the judge boo
I die for my 354 niggas, with the young stoned niggas
Lox are my heart, cold niggas
Sheek give it to you, like a bitch with a disease
That got AIDS on her lips and wish and hope you bleed
So if you want it, Fuck It!
In the Benz I'll be there, you gonna rot like
A dead Luco (spanish slang) under the stairs

[Blackrob]
Yeah yo, I swing that ass through the E-R, now I'm out the D-R
Heared in New York, y'all was looking for the Hee Haw
Lads is sweatin' us, we are four of the baddest
I'm the one that go stick you for all the cabage
The icon, doing this shit since Stride-on
Perpitrating ass niggas like you, I keep my eye on
I rake em, roll em, like smoke from Peter Ross
Then I hold em, stole em, work hard to be the boss
My fashion is Kumb-a-i, or else I'm attackin'
Dukes frontin acting like they toughest then napkins
Spittin', them bullshit crimes I stay hittin'
Not forgeting, the bullshit crimes and ass whippings
The whole 9, I dont waste time, I brace mines from the waistlines
Niggas is scared to face mine
See I'm a criminal, so after this interview
I'ma bend a few, Fuck It! Could we sin a few?
I put one into you, I promise to God
It's about time y'all niggas pay homage to Rob

[Styles]
You can catch me on the low with a Calico bitch
I got flow while she's bagging her shit
Comin' thru in a '98 wagon, lavender shit
Imagine the shit, used to be like packing the clip
Cop in the truck the S-C cockin' to dump
You can find me with my enemy coppin' his blunt
When I'm finished niggas ask which block do I want
My pockets is lumped, find me on a yacht with a blunt
What you know about daimonds, nigga knockin' the pump
While on my spare time I learned to market Heron
I'm gettin' valuble, celebrate with stuff off the Malibu
Science is the game and it's all mathematical
Pearl white Porche, licence plate "radical"
It's real when the fedaral-ies in Cali get mad at you
Forget that, Lox from the block want the shit back
And I was in the first place, feeling the hit backs

[Jadakiss]
Let me get back like Jada, more 'rabs than 3-ey-doe
Get the potatoe and clap at niggas in brod day-do
You know the flow, where it come from and where it go
Or where it's gonna be at, that's where we at
I touch you if you think I'm jiggy with the Puff
Move and still sellin' forty-thousand a week so Fuck You!
Three niggas you dont want none of make your insides
Feel like the summer you gettin' Dumber & Dumber
While we get smarter and smarter, makin' shit harder and harder
Til this rap games like the Carter
I'm Nino, Styles is raw steemed from casinos
And Sheek is the boss of the Hennisey gambino
We talking millions, you talking C-notes
You used to stash dope in a sea coach, couldn't play sweet though
You know the Kiss, on the low in the mist
Blowin' roach and sipping Red Ally and Moe with a bitch
When my niggas'll flip, see how cute you look
In the box with the suit on like you used to look
Hard body with a purple faced future look
Future crook, the same nigga who's boots I took
Juliani ain't a motherfuckin' joke
You got mad niggas broke, alot of niggas gettin' that coke
When they bring it to the lab is it sold to the slab
First felony, you still gettin' four and a half
[End]Verse One: Puffy
When night falls, that's when it all begins
Be prepared we can allow no loose ends
I highly recommend ya'll bring your arms
This is no false alarm
They want to do us harm
Like I'm nervous, live inside a glass house
They want to bring us down
Then drag us out
It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation
Startin conflict and don't know what they facing
Want twist us all in there black magic
? suggest paper of wars and break havoc
Are you ready, don't sleep on them
Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like confetti
Meet me at the getaway spot in a jiffy
Leave all the does behind that act iffy
We got maneuvers, that's hard to beat
Till the other side retreats
Under six feet beneath
C'mon

Verse Two: Mark Curry
I told u that is a saw I wore
I'm a kill
When the rebel yells song that don't stop till
It's done, see I got guns and I m sick
See how you said meet me here and I came quick
Them same catz on the most wanted list
We can hit them, Then straight disappear in the mist
?,Won't cease to exist
I shoot to kill and I'll be damned if I miss
A warrior waiting for Armageddon
I get serious as hell when I'm threatened
Intent to get hostile break into a rage of fury
Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right
A rude awakening and but now I'm alert
And that's right down my line of work
The whole Brotherhood new verse, gutless cowards with no back
And watch how they all fall flat
Ahh
Chorus:
Niggas gone fall out
They got us up against the wall
Here to call out, let it all out
With or without you I'm for war
Some shit's worth dying for, ah-huh

Niggas gone fall out
They got us up against the wall
Here to call out, let it all out
With or without you I'm for war
Some shit's worth dying for, ah-huh

Verse Three: Black Rob
Yo
You want hot soup, I got shit like up on in Attica
Guns ridiculous like Battlestar Galactica
What's this, want to insult my family?
La Familia, actin like ones of us gonna kill ya
I want ya'll dues
Shit hit the fan, we going to be eatin' your food
Time up in the new
Then torture, I rip a niggas toe nails off
What, I didn't here the news five slayin the law
Man, how I don't want do these catz
I lay mousetraps for those mice house niggas that house gats
They want to out me, I know killers from down south be
Who know and understand, there ain't a thing sweet about me
I earn my respect, and I was born to wreck
Spit techs, by your rockets threw jets
Who's next, to get hit by firepower that's so raw
Go play 4-4's ready for war

Verse Four: Mase
All out, what what
Wanna blow, what what
Teamsters what what
Mother Fucker
]From Monday to Sunday, it's all about the money
Nigga ain't got mine, I guarantee I'm gun play
Moms says "Mase, you gon need that money one day"
Bitch I'm in the jet, Benz on the runway
Don't be fooled, still squeeze tools
Money like that, why the fuck I need school
M-A dollar sign-E rules
Hundred G jewels
Vacate places you don't even need shoes
Same catz say stay up, prey 4 my day up
No one where my bitch live, plot where I lay up
If you got coke way up, Got doe then pay up
Niggas shoot at me a nigga better spray up
Cause God forbid, you hit me in my Ribs and I live
Comin back and getting you and your kids

Chorus

Verse Five: G-Dep
Dom Dom Dom
Thought I heard something
Last cat that I heard frontin
Burned up herb huntin
Word cause, my heard something
Splurge something
Now I don't care who I hit
Its who I hit I knew I hit
Who would understand though
We vandals and land roles
Program for our own channels
And flannel, this man knew any clan
We're here for the catz in the minivan
Gotta let this schemmie plan
Pay me man, scan
Sex, cars any money
Sex guard the money
With this gun, it be hard to run me
Get it right, or get it tonight
Better tonight
Set up your wife, with the head of the night
Don't fold cause my goals imbedded with ice
To my tents dimming the light
I'm bendin this mic
Lot of niggas don't comprehend
Lots niggas look sloppy when
They don't see me and I see them

Chorus
ChorusDangerous niggas

[Black Rob]
What y'all riffin about, hang em like they did in the South
Dead wit ya dick in ya mouth
Now what this shit is about, niggas sleepin
Like I won't slip in ya house, and put my dick in your spouse
Till you get home, I'm lamped like a part of ya couch
Then sit on me, that's what I'mma spit filthy
Pretty swiftly, til them coppers come and get me
Tried to tell his coward ass it's real
Actin like I can't get through that Slomen Shield
I'm a veteran, I'll take leathers and furs in front of him
Safe cracker, moved from New York to Jers
Still sending ?kites with birds?
Nothin's heard, feds wanna tap my word
Take vehicles off curbs, tools off herbs, jewels off of all you nerds
You swerve, I splurge with all yall riches
Comin to joke and blind all yall bitches
Give respect where respect is due
Keep frontin, and I'mma put the tech to you
Coward

CHORUS: Lil Kim and Black Rob
Dame espacio
Man back up off me
Dame espacio
Can I get a minute to breathe?
Dame espacio
That means give me space
Dame espacio
Damn back up off me

[Black Rob]
Like I'm just talking like I never did these things
Snatch chains and rings, teddy bears from siblings
I did things some of yall cowards might not imagine
Like run in the stores, gun drawn, spasm
Press the button bitch I'm not havin
Or it'll your super employee leave in a bag and
Black wagon, bait boy I'm not braggin
It's a promise, I'll take em to school like Nastradamus
It's my thing do what I do best
Want the treasure chest, and that dough in your girl breasts
How dare you try to stash yours in your drawls
What's mines is mines, what's yours ain't yours
Get his whip, watch how quickly I paint yours
Watch poppi and them, hit it up with the paintballs
Coward niggas, got the gall, thinkin I won't lamp in the hall
Like New Year's and drop the ball, bitches!

CHORUS

[Lil' Kim]
Where I come from, we all got guns
Be a hundred of yall and we still won't run
Call the cops, they still won't come
We bang on niggas like we playin the drums
These cats think they know me Black
Well I hit em over the head and say "Homey don't play that"
Listen to they rhymes and say didn't I say that?
Damn, I'm the shit, it's like I'mma nigga they be bitin my dick
Get on some old school shit, bitch run your kicks
Go on y'all can have my flow
I extort y'all hoes for all yall dough
And by now I think all yall know
Who's the winner, still champ by T.K.O. WHAT

CHORUS[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I wanna stay high in the clouds
I wanna keep plenty of pussy around
I'm gonna keep puttin' in bullets in pocket
Just in case, it's goin' down
I'm a Brooklyn soldier, yes, I'm is
If you lookin' for a problem, here it is
I'm worser than the cross and bones, and that's danger
I don't give a fuck, what beef it is

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now I'mma get serious, pussy don't talk, went the heat come out
Niggas sleep on Dirty, til the street come out
I like fame, but lockdown changed the nigga
Now it's all about the gauge, on the stage for nigga
Cuz haters wanna shoot, everything that shine
So I'm prepared, to lock and load my rhymes
Eat, two at a time, while my mind is bent
And dare motherfucker, come with Brook' with that
I be rollin' on the Boulevard, nothin' better rush
I'm like Big Ben with my middle finger up
Sidewalk hash, make thugs relax
Got a team that could devour your habitat
More gritty than Diddy, cause my hair's uncombed
Streets I roam, are too hot to throw on poems
Feel like every block's home, when the yay is yo
Gotta rob a motherfucker when the day is slow

[Hook]

[Black Rob]
Uh, pussy doctor, four-four cocker
Platinum, baby, ya'll niggas is goin' copper
I'm down in Bad Boy South with the nigga Chopper
Programmed to blow shit up, like Dennis Hopper
Hella pointed, hop out the helicopter
It's L.A.X. for the weed, it's hella proper
I rap, but still stick hoes for door knockers
And if she's persistent, block her, block her, block her
Infered, I call it the show shocker
It's M.S.G., with Jay-Z, the show stopper
And this is for them gangsta dudes, know you boppin'
That take dough, and don't take shorts for no coppers
My team are life stoppers, watch me split ya life up
Like Mekhi Phifer, in the movie "Clockers"
And just for doing the thing, they try to lock us
Wanna find me? I'm way in' the back with the pill poppers

Home

[Verse 1: Black Rob]
I couldn't wait to get home
My flow live like Madden in the zone
That's 10,000 homes daddy
Beep beep the focus ain't changed
Like who controlling the streets
Man this records are leaked
Everybody else spit obsolete
I'll show em the agony of defeat
Never wake a bear when he sleep
Cause the first thing that he goin' wanna do is eat
Big stages I don't give a fuck we there
Fake thugs stickin' em up like buckwheat hair
Pour rank man these dudes is franks with sauerkraut
I turn they power out like fam this our house
Daddy, you wanna be the box ?
Now your chances are slim like clothespins
No gun laws fam I'm holdin'
We axe all they do is scratch like Logan

[Hook](x8)
Home

[Verse 2: Cormega]
I couldn't wait to get home
My flow live like Melo in the zone
I am ready to explode
Black Rob and 'Mega ?
I'm in rare company yet poetically alone
Sayin' life's a bitch is getting old
If your life ain't in order, seize control
Adversity's a lesson, be composed
Above all spread love hate stains the soul
Those with no purpose are afraid to grow
He who walks in small steps has a way to go
On the road to the riches you exposed to resentment
Everybody wanna eat but they won't do the dishes
My whole view is different since I rose from the benches
The goal was to get it and I showed true persistence

[Hook]Intro: Mariah Carey & Puff Daddy

Oh, oh
Honey got me hooked on you
I like that, uh
I thought I told you
That we won't stop
Ooh, ooh (Come on)

Verse 1: The Lox, Black Rob, Mariah Carey

All the money in the world couldn't even amount
To a teaspoon of honey that'll melt in your mouth (That's right)
It's The Lox and Mariah you know you check'n this out
You know they deal a few meals every time she come out
With her blown
And us flown
There ain't nuthin left for us to talk about
But a whole lot of doe

And every current affiar
We there
Keepin' your hands in the air
Like we just don't care (Come On)
Don't be a lier
Would you change your attire (MC)
Get a bomb like Hillshire
Wit the honey like Mariah
Sceam to the ranch then ride a horse
Then come back to the city pushin' a Rolls Royce

Honey you can have me
When you want me
You simply ask me to be there (a huh)
And you're the only one
Who makes me come running
Cause what you got
Is far beyond compare, ooh

Chorus: Mariah Carey

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (That's right)
Oh baby I've got a dependancy
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey (Uh huh)
When it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you
Crying for you
I adore you
Boy you know your love addected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day
I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside (yeah, yeah)
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside

Verse 2: Mariah Carey

Yeah, ooh
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey (I like that)
Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
You're the only thing I wanna do

Chorus: Mariah Carey

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependancy
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey

Verse 3: Mase, Mariah Carey

You know Mase huff, We Puff
We blow your house down
Bring that Harlem world sound
Directly to your town, In fact
This is why I act like that
I ain't dropped one single
And I made this money back
I rock so swell, I gotta prevail
First rap superstar dominating pop sales
You never wish me well cause it start to sell
And it land me with pretty women in the Swiss hotel
And girls that mean a lot
I get em from the shop
Buy them everything they got
From the jeans to the watch
You wanna be my misses
You gotta meet me wanna spoil you with my bitches
And you could tell that Mase is real
Cause he do real things
And I make things thats average look real mean
When it comes to sex I got the real thing
So when you cover your mouth they could hear you still scream

Baby I can love you babe
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah you're on fire)
Gotta hold on love thy saints
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah take us higher)
Ooohh
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah you're on fire)
Ooohh
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah take us higher)

Oooh, woah (Yeah)

Ooh, woah, honey, got me hooked on you

Honey, it's like

Chorus: Mariah Carey

Honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you

For another taste of honey

Nigga's got me sittin' on the roof
Eye trained, on scope, blessin' 100 proof
Hand on toes, 'bout to roast
Some kids who flash like they assassins
Picked up my dough and b-ked this honey passin'
Got the spot on lock
Taking flicks around the corner
She made it where the spot ain't hot
Like a potato, she got five-oh on the payroll
They sniffin' yeyo, I don't know what to say, yo
There they go in front of the store
Dressed in black shit
Some like theys are meaner
If they be hustlin' back, we'll fuck 'em
Can't even do one thing, assassinate 'em
That's it, that's all, solo
Single, no more, no less, stocks rang, yo
Money caught one in his Kangol
D.O.A. as his man made his run for the door
Caught 'em in the 'gaitor shoes his girl probably bought 'em
Too bad, Black ain't get the chance to extort him
Cuz Nigga's like that don't deserve to live
Word the myth
And we ain't got no love to give
For these drop shots who wanna be down
Wanna be clowns, the fail ones
I like how all that good shit sounds
And I dare one

I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me
You won't win

Nigga, I sleigh, you pray, kill that ass uptown
Dump yo' bitch ass back around your way
When I'm in one of those moods I can give a fuck
I mean cool, run and bungie jump off the fuckin' roof
I hear voices calling me, givin' me fits
Singing tonight's the night Black Rob, let's write these hits
In the halls of death, you get left, I'm in the top 10
Even Rocky trainer and his wife said you can't win
Scream battle, but you never fought
That's like me sayin' I got five, never ran a full court
Stab the devil in his belly, took his Pelle Pelle
Blew the spot down and slid straight to the tele
I see envious eyes, envious guys, different states
Mad we seen 'em, different cake
Rob me, tear that asshole out of place
Cuz in the end I'm the head case you gotta face
And I dare one

I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me
You won't win

It feels good not to be dealin' with petty cash
Me and D-Dot all we seein' now is ready cash
And ready ass, splash in the Jacuzzi
Honey from the movies, south notch cutie
Used to go to Harrah with D after the homecomin'
On my way from Kakalaka
Me and Merse was gun running
Musta done something all conspicuous
Eye of the tiger, I know these cats are sick of this
Ridiculous sayin' these cats don't love Black
This is Bad Boy, I puttin' it where it 'posed to be at
Lemme know where to put your rosary at
My enemies, I let 'em get a load of me gat
Fine, you don't believe Black real official
Playa way, get your ma's cake, and kiss you
You leavin', wasn't part of this plan
Understand it's all about the Bengi's man
And I dare one

I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me
You won't win

I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To come for me
You won't win

I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me

Uhh.. UHH
Yeah..

Uh! Yeah.. yeah..

Fuck em.. yeah, uhh..
With my hands gripped.. praise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her.. (dump her body, dump her body) sewer
Our father.. uh-huh..

What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uhh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake

Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 2X)

With my hands gripped.. praise the Lord shit
Our father.. if I should die before I wake

[Black Rob]
Fluck that
Snap a nigga shit, smash him with the fifth, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the Glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher; mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers -- see Biggie Smalls
Recruited these snipers -- alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm
Paralyzin my niggas thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, hop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch nigga.. whoah..

Chorus

[Beanie Sigel]
Yo when you fuckin wit Mac, you fuckin wit the best
Still going to war with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S.K. can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggas get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin bleedin -- from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggas start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
Or I sick two pits to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin the brick, facin that shit
Takin two sniffs, grabbin my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggas takin some shit
Picture niggas takin my shit

Chorus

[Ice Cube]
Niggas never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
In the year 2000, all drunk and pissy
Off whiskey, you can miss me, actin gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L.A
Doin it the O.G. way; it's sorta like
The Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
The Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine, and seperate yo' head from yo' spine
So, "Grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop" and
Fuck you niggas that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy, of this nation, for assassination
Of the young black male in this black hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather
That you and 2Pac got yo' shit together
California Love

Chorus(I'll always be there for you)
[Puff] Yeah
(I'll never betray you)
[Puff] Mmm, mmm, mmm
(I love you baby)
[Puff] I love you baby

Verse One: Black Rob

I met her Uptown on Dyckman, aight then
Talkin that, how she only dealt with businessmen
Niggas baggin joints, money off and on the books
The ones who stand firm like ain't, nuttin shook
About them, I doubt them cats waitin for me
You know them niggas, them big dudes across the street
She say, "Yeah, they from over on Mayfair"
Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out
This bitch over there with them pointin the chief out
They want beef out here, they gon' get it
In the worst way, I'mma show em how Black play
Roll the dice, fuckin with me is like snake eyes
I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise
It's all about the Benjamins, true that be the motto
Ran out of ammo and started, throwin bottles
Runnin, and I ain't lookin back for shit
Crooked ass bitch, today I get you back for this
(I'll get you back)

Chorus: repeat 2X

I love you baby No you don't
You drive me crazy That's right
I'll never betray thee Uhh
I love you baby C'mon

Verse Two: Black Rob (starts rapping during the chorus)

Yo since the last altercation I been on the street
Seein honey at the club every week and not speak
I'mma rock that ass to sleep before I strike
I ain't know the real deal until last night
How, one of them brothers was locked with Babe Bro
Used to call my crib from C-Seventy-Four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the jack
Babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl
Youse about to get fucked with no gel
I'mma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin
And plan your extermination, word

Chorus

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

It took a while to peep your style, Miss I-B-M-workin
Low profile single, house in Staten Island
And Manhattan while, them same cats
You sent to get me boo, is on they to get you
Fuckin witchu, that small time crack dealin nigga
He a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too
Shit's real, you think you gonna set me up
And get away scot free without some type of injury
Nah kill it, I'mma flip the script on you
Same thing you did to me, I'mma do it to you
Who knew she was the female Rambo
Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans and
In the end, she had to be the Last Bitch Standin
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong
Just like that she was gone, now it's over
Assumin I'll go back to my everyday life
Of a rich millionaire just rockin the mic
Gotta pause, and think about honey no doubt
And admire how the chick went out

Chorus: repeat to fade(Verse One)

Yo had me in the LQ
Yo shit was mad bumpin
Rappers on the mic was like settin off somethin
Now parties like this yo god
I like lougin observin everything inside my surrounding
Jasmine dancin wit this non-descrip sucka
Okay cool as long as the sucka don't touch her
Nigga
Get the urge and can't control his hand
Get a body bag cause "mauh" he's a dead man
She was coolin sportin my table
When the dance was done she like walked back to money's table
I sat there like shit I can't believe this
I wish you was there big fella so you could see this bitch
Sittin there boo legs wide open laughin gigglin smilin and jokin wit homes
Like they use to hang out real real tough
He musta had a strong rap cause Jasmine looked gased up
Sittin there played the role of a slouch
Just watchin to see how Jasmine played herself out
They sat there just talkin to each other
I thought this kid was alone he had five more brothas wit him
Wit out girl's night ain't this some shit
If she don't recognize the game they can kiss this shit
They introduced theyselves one at a time
Saw 'em say how you doin so Jasmine say "fine"
I was laughin but there was more in store
I saw her get up and start walkin towards the front door
I rolls too god and walked right behind em
So where ever they go it won't be hard to find em
I keep a guard you now I thought I better
Plus I keep the stash deep inside the 8 pound leather
Open doors vale was on the ready
At the end Jasmine is gonna wish she never met me
We're off two cars speedin deep in the night
I'm doin 30 on the straight away 60 on the turnpike
For Jasmine

(Chorus)
Know that i've got Jasmine on my mind
Ohhhhh
Playa freeze while I pull out my nine
Know that i've got Jasmine on my mind
Ohhhhh

(Verse Two)

Word up ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still chasin them suckas in the '86 Jetta
Thinkin different thoughts still not understandin
How 7 people got in that fuckin Volkswagen
Enough of that god yo back to the chase
Yo man you should've seen the ruckus look on my face
Slowin down cruisin on the cool out mode
Then parked in front of his house on Gunhill road
Man I started to get out
Grabbed the rope and try to hang her
Before I let this posse drop shots gang bang her
They went inside man but I kept goin
Parked across the street wit out them even knowin
Got out the car still schemin the house
Tip toed around the back quiet like a church mouse
If the neighbors looked out the window
They would surely get leerly and scream like "BAHANDO"
Police they would hold my fate
But they didn't so I creeped up the fire escape
I saw shadow's inside a bright lit room
Which appear to be two bodies dancin to a slow song nigga
I got closer decided I should check it
I saw Jasmine and one of them kids dancin buck naked
So I got the gat so I have no interference
When I make my grand appearance
For Jasmine

(Chorus)

(Verse Three)

I seen a red dot tryna lock on me
I can't believe these niggas tryna pull a pac on me
I admit they had the drop on me
Probably turned the burner around 20 degrees
So I could see
Who bust me
Who knocked me out
Who tried to choak
Who tied the rope
Who left me this bitch ass note
I'm disgusted the murder she wrote
Money she oaked all of my coke all of dope
Up in smoke
Made you follow me probably so mad you wanna hollow me
But you won't be so lucky today so swallow me
Got your GS4 and your Bently rose took all of your clothes
And 99 bottles of Mo's
What she didn't know is about the dynamite in the rose
And if I get close I'll blow her cause I got the controls
At the toll on the phone wit this bitch Nicole
Said she left you in some hotel out in the road
Room 112 penthouse sweet alumni
On the 12th floor in front of her door was one guy
On some Brandon Lee shit he wasn't handin me shit
Understand me he flipped bust the 9 and he split
Had my heat cocked busted right through the sheet rock
How'd he drop he ain't the nigga I just shot
Whas goin on all of a sudden it was nothin no jokin son
Jasmine holdin the smokin gun
By the time I realized I caught two in the chest had the vest
As I fell I'm not thinkin of death
Still fallin to a place wit more conscience though
Long enough to see her aim and put one in her throat
So I got up all shot up grabbed the Prada
Faggots probably towed my truck
You know how my luck
Hoped in bleedin to death turned left
Thought of Jasmine and how she went out to the death
For Jasmine

(Chorus)[Black Rob - almost mumbling]
They said that I'm a Rottweiler
And I'm from the Rottweiler house
The Rottweiler New York

[G-Dep]
Really, get smacked silly, you get smacked silly
Fucking with these niggas from the, what you gon' do
When you ready? Shit I was born ready
And I was already on fish and spaghetti
Creep with the culture, rap I can coach ya
Attack like a vulture, see what I told ya?
Said I'd get'cha, wear it if it fit ya
Y'all thirteen inches, I see the big picture
If it's to get richer, I'd probably get wit ya
If not burn it, get hot like a furnace
Shoot the video, motherfuck city permits
We own the city, on the phone with Diddy (*phone sounds*)
Red bone pretty, when she get aroused
Like to suck her own titty; put it in the video
Ya wanna holla got to follow nigga here we go
Get you ticket, the train, don't miss it
Won't reach out, and ya bet I won't visit
'til my whole wardrobe is-it, now listen

(Chorus)
Make this money, take this money (Let's get it)
Ain't no way you can take this from me (Let's get it)
Ain't shit funny (uh) shake it honey (Let's get it)
Take it money.. now let's get it (Let's get it)

[G-Dep]
Creep with your people
Though my shit is Sweet and Low it's no Equal
Front but you lookin
Once I throw the hook in proceed to get cookin
With the game when I sewed it
Since you came thought I owed you one
Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him
With my man's type proper
Better learn quick, cause my clique don't argue
You ain't my crew, who are you? Beat it
'fore we take off make sure you all seated
In Billboard read it, believe it

(Chorus)

[G-Dep]
Soul Controller, rap Ayatollah
Kids hate me when they older I put cracks by the stroller
I'm registered voter, motherfuck a quota
Give some bakin soda and a quarter
Bet I flow straight up out the water
I'mma wreck the game 'til it say "out of order"
Put the high score up
Then tear the floor up
On the world tour with your whore out in Europe
Head on the tour bus
Do what them niggas in the drop thinks cooler
Called up five reporters to thank my supporters
Hittin wives and daughters
Brought 'em neck spray from Estee Lauders
Call Puffy to order

[P-Diddy]
Aiyyo, call me Diddy - I run this city
Send the cops, the D.A. and feds to come get me
Cats wanna leave me for dead you comin with me
Gettin head in the Bentley red at one fifty
Straight lose it, love two things my family my music
Might co-write and produce it
Drop mine, hot 9 exclusive
Got y'all Hawkin like Yusef
Cause I can, break backs and stacks it's no problem
Make raps and tracks and go Harlem
I get worldwide coverage
Got so many spots I don't even buy luggage, ya love it
Make moves major, hide out in Asia
If your girl keep comin around them I'm a blaze her
I'm the Bad Boy flavor, light blue gators
NOT GUILTY, and I'm filthy, c'mon

(Chorus)

[Black Rob (Puffy)]
I be the Eastside Soprano, Rob Marciano
Flow in e'ry channel with the Iverson handle
Forty-five sparks turn your day gray flannel
Snatch the yay of the mantle, then proceed to dismantle
Can't slay Rob
How many niggas done tried to play Rob, quit they day job
Tired of putting broke niggas under the wing
If I go to jail again I'm goin under the bing
Act like you gon' pull that thing thing
You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling
I represent "A" block in Sing Sing
Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen
Moves for paper, booze no chaser
Bullets out the blazer four-fifth with the laser
Come and get your shit splitted, newspapers said I did it
(He ain't do it) Now let's get it (Let's get it)

(Chorus) (x3)* differs from the remix on P. Diddy's "Bad Boy For Life" 12"

[Black Rob]
They said that I'm a Rottweiler
And I'm from the Rottweiler house, the Rottweiler New York

Stand by and I'm reppin for Queens (that's right)
My destination is, detonation (say what?)

And if they want war, we can war (we can war)

While you stare in amazement, I'm hotter than Cajun

[P. Diddy over Hook]

[Loon]

Simple and plain (plain), the reason why I entered the game
(that's right) I seen Sean do it, so I'm tryin to get it the same
(let's go) Pimpin ain't changed, niggas still gettin 'em thangs
Got the six with Shaquille feet rippin 'em lanes
Got a chick that's a real freak givin me brains
The temperature changed, soon as nigga get off the plane
So ya know a nigga gettin some change, stand over the game
While do they shake they shoulders the same? (why?)
We get money, they ain't supposed to be playin
So what we supposed be sayin
You niggas actin like these crackers ain't payin
So let's get it (you got it), so let did it again (c'mon)
In 2002, son, I'm diggin the Benz (that's right)

2001, The Saga Continues

[P. Diddy]
The Saga Continues, yeah {*ad libs to end*}[Intro]
The world ain't no different now
The world ain't no different now

[Verse 1]
Never had a dime, my life a crime
Had to be when I was nine, moms drunk off wine
Running with all kinds her mind stayed in the stupor
'til the point she paid no mind to the super
Stay mad but stay fronting with smiles
Stayed on the ground once and a while
First day of school never had nothing too style
Mister Colondre stressing, I ain't coming in a while
It was a bummer, rocking the shit I rocked all summer
On the first day, I was feeling some kind of way
And she wasn't trying to do nothing, you would think
For the sake of the kids, she would enroll in school or something
Now I know then was even harder
'specially for a single mother raising me with no father
Shit living up in this tenement, eating stale Entenmann's
Talking wild shit to Spanish immigrants
I speak in codes, man tú sabe
Always cállate bendición to my madre
Even though she did nothing for me
Acknowledge me as I run down my life story

[Hook]
You don't know, how crazy it is outside
I die inside too many times
Oh, I've cried, oh, I've cried
I know [?]
Can you forgive me? Can you forgive me? Oh, my baby

[Verse 2]
Check the skit, nobody never gave me shit
If anything a nigga framed me and made me get
3 to 6 my first bid, no doubt up in Spofford
Had to be 12 son, trying to make a profit
Remembering robbed my moms with no guilt
Eating pork and beans or corn flakes wit no milk
Bitter, in school I smacked cats in a hurry
Moms ain't care she wasn't getting drunk wit Mrs. Berry
On the first floor, I used to thirst for greenery
Picking pockets with Seth and Jay from 106th Street
Yo, fuck home, I'm tired of getting punched in my dome
Tired of hearing this faggot-ass nigga moan, I started roaming
My hustle game is deep, cats ya heard
From San Fran back to Manhattan to Newburg
Notorious tell your friends to spread the word
Glorious, my life story is absurd

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Home from Elmira, got a little brighter
I'mma keep it real still a schemer and conniver
Recognize the struggle, living like a thug do
Hatred in my heart but inside I love you
See no matter what I will extend my arms to hug you
Knowing I am just like you, I am like the double
All I wanna know is how you pound me down
Yo, this shit is real and you really jerked me around
But any way I am getting paid with Puff now
Bout to cop you a house I can send you some stuff now
So many levels jail take you
I appreciate jail, cause it made me appreciate you
I've been through fire and brimstone
Used to be diplomas in jail, now I cop the gem stone
I remembered when you rushed me
The time you said you should of flushed me, I forgive you ma trust me

[Hook]
