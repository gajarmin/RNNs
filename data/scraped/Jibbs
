I'd always try to lose em' when I just got em'
Cause I fall for the wrong, guess I got a problem [x3]
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem
Stop tripping', do the math, maybe you could solve it

[Verse 1: Versice Barnes]
7:30, back before her curfew
The first rules broken, then her brothers hurt you
They encourage you with words, force you to oblige
And that circle in your Wallet better be there all night
Her parent 10% African, at a mass and a fellowship
Let her practice for medicine, and she be checking the testaments
And by test, I meant she checks 'fore she ever lets you in
And her preference depends on whether you're a gentleman
Rather
Carnes Asada
Glass of kulana
Than ever eat with your mama or sip a pint of the lager
She the dream type
Known to a brother as "Ms right"
But at this day and age it's best to stop and think twice
Flirt with the flower, save the nectar for the ending
So I'd think about it for a second
And before I eat a kitkat first sniff the wrapper
Handle all the riffraffs like it don't matter
BEAST

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Magic]

Hol' up, yeah you know we on
Black skinnies and I got my slippers on
Walking through the shadows, yeah I got my fingers crossed
Conversations with mirror, I'm the fairest of them all
Like "mirror, mirror", my competition, ain't never ever been another nigga come between us
No bitches either, or hatin' niggas, or ass niggas, shit, the sound of my voice is enough to make them wither
Cockiness? Something like confidence
I'm the owner of the share, yeah I got the divided
Got your girl in my mouth, I can taste the evidence
Got the medicine in hand, trying to cure my ignorance
So the remedies intact, ain't you fucking generous?
Well you must be supermad thinking you can fuck with us (huh)
Circle of broads, something I need when I'm bored
Should be in a course, like sleeping with better whores, I'm BEAST

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jibbz]

I'm on a "Loo V"
And the other V
You know the ones niggas be claiming they getting G
See I'm a pro, watch and learn, semi-Gs
But you probably not gonna learn cause it's in the genes
Swag, dope on fire, it's simmering
Got y'all niggas blind cause I'm shimmering
When you were with you girl, she was seeing me
I never made a move, then she started leaning in
I could be a cheesy nigga, sweet-talk you
And say shit like "I love to cuddle"
See
There is a risk in that
That could make me be a friend and not a dick in that
Ass
I got a problem, bitch can you slove em' please
I ain't gonna spill if you keep it clean
To something that would make us have kids
I'mma give you that "D" cause you know I'm BEAST

[Hook][Intro]
Yo whassup y'all? This ya boy young Jibbs
I'm 'bout to tell y'all what a "oh" is
A "oh" is them zeroes after them real numbers
Naw; let's change that "oh" into an H - for you haters!

[Chorus: Jibbs]
You a golddiggin (ho) I ain't messin with no (ho)
Cause I'm a rhino (oh) put it on vinyl (oh)
And I ain't no (ho) you can go find yo' (ho)
Train yo' (ho) and sign yo' (ho)
Go and throw them digits (oh) boy I ain't messin with no (ho)
Cause I'm a rhino (oh) put it on vinyl (oh)
And I ain't no (ho) you can go find yo' (ho)
Train yo' (ho) and sign yo' (ho)

[Jibbs]
Ayy! My name Jibbs, but they call me Mighty JOE
The kid down and out with the outerspace FLOW
Stay waved up, pookie madden with a 'FRO
Jag chillin in the back with girls hollerin at JOE
Who you know got a C with a three and double OH
I write my own stuff never will I need a GHOST
Spit so cold that you prolly need a COAT
And I keep bread tell 'em bring it by the BOAT
Clownin on stage but Jibbs is no JOKES
Oh Lil' Louis strong, got 'em hangin from a ROPE
All my diamonds real, no gold or glass, COPE
But if you're all washed up don't drop the SOPE
Beatsta Music don't bang that LOW
It bang your feet, boy you can feel yo' TOES
And I am the hottest but don't keep it on the LOW
And they mad cause I riot and I fly like a CROW

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Spit punchlines, one to me is like FIRE
That's because I gotta spread around like a HIGH
Jibbs and the whole Lil' Louis is a TRIBE
And we keep goin higher 'til we see ourselves FLY
Spit punchlines, hope it hit you in ya EARRRS
When I'm at a concert girls be drawin TEARRRS
Lose 'em in the dark no havin no FEARRRS
And they callin me a spaceship the way I'm switchin GEARRRS
If you a golddigger; ho I'm platinum plus
Diamond out bezel; don't let the platinum rust
Boy perfect timin, but I ain't gon' speak of Glocks
All up in your speakers, they call me speakerbox!

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
People wanna see theyselves that Jibbs is a BEAST
One of me is like five, two more than THREE
Bet four, I gotta make my money INCREASE
And five is the reason why the lock need a KEY
So if you ain't throwin then you need to catchy CHO-RUS
Keep switchin Timbs, many trees like a FOR-EST
Deal with the rhymes like my sign is a TAU-RUS
And I'm all about mine you can keep mindin YO-URS
Now speak for yourself I'ma keep goin HIGH
So above average I don't think you wanna TRY
I'ma tell the truth that I don't have to LIE
And I'm beastin my peers I don't think you wanna TRY
You can mess with Jibbs (nope) man I think you won't (nope)
Cause this rap thing (yup) I been doin long (yup)
So you need to sit... down where you bend
Cause I'ma just... make your head spin~!

[Chorus] - 2X

Cause I been with it, in fact I'mma throw a hit with it
Tried to blow my mind when she turned around and spinned with it
So we could take it on back to the flo' ma
If you ain't dancin than you lookin at the do' ma
And she'll fall if she do a little mo' ma
Next thing she saw is them Lamborghini doors ha?
Don't get it twisted, I ain't sayin you could leave boo
Go on bring it back and you could show me what that thing do
Don't get it twisted, I ain't saying you could leave boo
Put it in reverse...

Cause that king kong will have your ears ringing like a ring tone
[Hook]

[Jibbs]
Yea, yea, yea, yea, them beats is knocking and I got it on lock
Cause I make hits like I'm boxing
Started it up and it sound like a rocket
Then I have you hanging inside like a pocket PC
See the beats is beating you hear me before you see me
Before you even can reach me and the have you thinking
That this boy is a beast in the streets
While you blinking have you wobbling like you been drinking
I'll eat you, It's like I got speakers in my speakers
So when they speaking on it all that they gon' speak of is a beaster boy
So don't make me just treat you to a feast
A beast that just beats up both of your ear drums

[Hook][Jibbs]
Yeah...
Okay whassup y'all?
This is one of those dancin songs

[Chorus: Jibbs]
We ride big big cars, and big big rims
And we rock big clothes, with them big thick Timbs
Got big cribs, cause we got big grip
I'm a real big kid, cause we do it real big

[Jibbs]
Flow so hot; VVS diamonds in my big big watch
You know I got it on lock
Keep a chick on my arm more than a watch
She start lookin at my finger maybe cause of the rocks
And now the G's on the block shocked like the watch
It's like a car show when I open up my garage
Vipers Maseratis Lamborghini drop-tops
Cutty cutty hydraulics once we drop it like it's, like it's hot
One take, matter fact y'all all are fakes
So therefore I'll make your head alternate
Cause while you stabbin I'm jabbin, you get to rappin and actin
And try to make it a habit, but Trix ain't for silly rabbits
Flawless style that make you shake
Girls "Cry Me a River" like Timberlake
That's like music that's trapped in, a stereo wrapped in
A gift that you wrapped and so you ain't hearin jack then

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Pull up in a whip, they want to see
The T-I-P of my dip, think I better get a grip
My money like the Olympics, I gotta make it flip
And never really can fall in but gotta take the trip
I'm livin on "Cribs" while you dreamin in your criiiib
So all you big babies can keep on your bibs
Stayin on tour while my album gettin shipped
Tryin to get FOUR picks - plain, bus, car, ships~!
So give it break, and still call Jibbs the great
You need to chill wit'cha grill sayin Jibbs a fake
Cause while you be grillin, your boy Jibbs be chillin
I'm trying to make me some millions put chandeliers in the ceilin
Do it big, tryin to get mo' on my plate
While you goin half crazy I put half on a lake
So 16's I spit, for sixteen you get
By sixteen I'm livin like sixteen was millions

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Doin big thangs, rock big clothes
With them big big chains and we fly big planes
'Copter so fly so we flyin through the rain
Young Jibbs switchin lanes while you dudes bein lame
So who you know that is hot and can flow like this
Ride in the back of the Range and rove like this
Stay iced out let it show like this
I bet you ain't got a chorus that'll go like this

[Chorus][repeat 7X]
Fire as that thang

[Jibbs - speaking over repeat]
Fire as that thang
Y'know, far as that thang

[Verse One]
I'm the big big kid, I'm doin big thangs
And ain't what you call big headed but I got a big brain
My lifestyle changed and when I got a little change
Not the attitude but gratitude to this game
You ain't seen nothin blingin until you've seen my chain
Cause the young'n be ballin harder than NBA
I get twist like caps but when I disappear my face
Everybody snappin photos tryin to get in my face
Cause I'm sorta like a loco, I'm on top of my game
And the way I spit on records, fire as a flame
So you know I keep a chick that's fire as that thang (fire as that thang)
I got a iced-out grill and a iced-out watch
With them Nike checks on - my shoes and socks
And my ear is like an alley cause it's full of rocks
I'm a key to the game and I got it on lock

[Chorus: repeat 2X
Fire as that thang (you know I'm fire as that thang)
Fire as that thang (you know she fire as that thang)
Fire as that thang (what's that thang, what's that thang boy)
Fire as that thang (what's that thang, what's that thang boy)

[Verse Two]
(Fire as that thang) See this my year, I'm 'bout to start a new thang
Fo' bottom, white gold with the iced-out fangs
Make that Hemme holla, charger almost sound like a train
Cruisin to the hood on the highway and we switchin lanes
I stay fresh, I stay fly in the best clothes
Rock the best bows, outfits get set low
A funny guy I'm all the girls' heartthrob
Smart never rock a square's pants like Spongebob
I'm sick with the flow, cause I'm the hottest
Get to my do' and I ain't speakin when they knockin
It's just about my time to shine so don't get'cha eyes
Where that time is, cause my shine'll blind
(Young Jibbs~!) I got u'rybody movin this year
Cause I own two planets the sun and moon in my urr
Half yellow, half white, and it ain't no game
Cause your boy Jibbs is...

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
(Fire as that thang)
She saw the bottom of my grill and said I was "fire as that thang!"
She said she pictured me as bein "fire as that thang!"
Told her to come and call her friends that's "fire as that thang!"
Can't be no less than a ten, she "fire as that thang!"
Your boy done rockin the Lexus "fire as that thang!"
Princess cuts and VVS's "fire as that thang!"
And all them trunks on the man "fire as that thang!"
I don't care what y'all sayin, she

[Chorus]

Fire as that thang...[Jibbs]
Aye yo, this another Big Big Kid exclusive right here baby (Yeah)
Beatstaz Music (Okay)

Le-Le-Le-Let's go

Let's wait awhile - Before it's too late

Let's wait awhile - Our love will be great
(Wait a minute girl, wait awhile for me)
Let's wait awhile - Before we go too far
(Wait a minute girl.. I'll never stay away)

[Jibbs]
We can slow it down, wait around for a minute
And pick this thing back up so we can get wit' it
You know I'm feelin' you girl but I'm just sensin'
That you wanna get wit' me
In the air, I'm feelin' tension
We can hit the mall sometimes, throw me them digits
So we can floss a little, ride wit' me in my Bentley
Coorodinatin' clothes, True Religion - True Religion
Then hit up the Hamptons, and spend a day in Venice
But we can do this all just as soon as I finish
I know you don't like this but girl, this is the business
As soon as I get some time, then we can start chillin'
But right now the boy is on a mission for a million, so

[Melody] (Jibbs)
Let's wait awhile - Before it's too late

Let's wait awhile - Our love will be great

Let's wait awhile - Before we go too far
(Wait a minute girl.. I'll never stay away)

[Jibbs]
It's crazy all the things she do to try to get wit' me
Always tryin' to get me, say she flyin' to my city
She doin' anything just to get my attention
But I got a lot to do girl, just wait until I'm finished
When I can't answer, she be blowin' up my phone
Tryin' to hang wit' my sister er'ytime I'm gone
(Er'ytime you gone?) Yeah, er'ytime I'm gone
Tryin' to get next to the people in my home
And I ain't tryin' to brush you off, I'm tryin' to paint the picture
But at the same time, you know I wanna get wit' ya
You gotta understand me, girl, I'm tryin' to get this paper
So if you understand me then, do me this favor and

[Melody] (Jibbs)
Let's wait awhile - Before it's too late
(Wait a minute girl, wait awhile for me)
Let's wait awhile - Our love will be great
(Wait a minute girl, wait awhile for me)
Let's wait awhile - Before we go too far
(Wait a minute girl.. I'll never stay away)

[Jibbs]
See I been peepin' you, I know that you're likin' me

Leave you dead in a hall
Or you gon' keep hanging in the streets with your crew
Don't ask me cuz I know what I'm a do

In choke holds after getting chased by the po po's

Disrespectin all your elders
Go livin in a shelter
Or you gon' get killed put in jail or be a doctor
And own a big house on the roof a helicopter

Whatchu gon' do?
Stay in the same city, same hood, same block
Same homies changing clothes, wearin eachothers socks
Or do you wanna go somewhere
A life to try to live
And see about a hundred
Making money, taking trips

Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on

Be a face nigga - sharp
Or go and shop and stuff
Hit the mall, pop tags
Start stuff
Get me red, white and blue like the flag

Jibbs what you gon' do?
Gettin money, stay off the streets
They frontin man - it ain't funny, I ain't runnin
Hopin from place to place like a bunny kinda sunny
Phone on my waist vibrate cuz it's comin

Funny

For the sake that my hood cats hungry
Tryin to get a mil deal, bread and bologna
For the sake that my hood cats that are hungry
Tryin to get a mil deal, bread and bologna

Comin up in da hood![Intro]
Yo whassup y'all? This ya boy young Jibbs

A "oh" is them zeroes after them real numbers
Naw; let's change that "oh" into an H - for you haters!

[Chorus: Jibbs]
You a golddiggin (ho) I ain't messin with no (ho)
Cause I'm a rhino (oh) put it on vinyl (oh)

Train yo' (ho) and sign yo' (ho)
Go and throw them digits (oh) boy I ain't messin with no (ho)
Cause I'm a rhino (oh) put it on vinyl (oh)
And I ain't no (ho) you can go find yo' (ho)
Train yo' (ho) and sign yo' (ho)

[Jibbs]
Ayy! My name Jibbs, but they call me Mighty JOE
The kid down and out with the outerspace FLOW
Stay waved up, pookie madden with a 'FRO
Jag chillin in the back with girls hollerin at JOE
Who you know got a C with a three and double OH
I write my own stuff never will I need a GHOST
Spit so cold that you prolly need a COAT
And I keep bread tell 'em bring it by the BOAT
Clownin on stage but Jibbs is no JOKES
Oh Lil' Louis strong, got 'em hangin from a ROPE
All my diamonds real, no gold or glass, COPE
But if you're all washed up don't drop the SOPE
Beatsta Music don't bang that LOW
It bang your feet, boy you can feel yo' TOES
And I am the hottest but don't keep it on the LOW
And they mad cause I riot and I fly like a CROW

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Spit punchlines, one to me is like FIRE
That's because I gotta spread around like a HIGH
Jibbs and the whole Lil' Louis is a TRIBE
And we keep goin higher 'til we see ourselves FLY
Spit punchlines, hope it hit you in ya EARRRS
When I'm at a concert girls be drawin TEARRRS
Lose 'em in the dark no havin no FEARRRS
And they callin me a spaceship the way I'm switchin GEARRRS
If you a golddigger; ho I'm platinum plus
Diamond out bezel; don't let the platinum rust
Boy perfect timin, but I ain't gon' speak of Glocks
All up in your speakers, they call me speakerbox!

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
People wanna see theyselves that Jibbs is a BEAST
One of me is like five, two more than THREE
Bet four, I gotta make my money INCREASE
And five is the reason why the lock need a KEY
So if you ain't throwin then you need to catchy CHO-RUS
Keep switchin Timbs, many trees like a FOR-EST
Deal with the rhymes like my sign is a TAU-RUS
And I'm all about mine you can keep mindin YO-URS
Now speak for yourself I'ma keep goin HIGH
So above average I don't think you wanna TRY
I'ma tell the truth that I don't have to LIE
And I'm beastin my peers I don't think you wanna TRY
You can mess with Jibbs (nope) man I think you won't (nope)
Cause this rap thing (yup) I been doin long (yup)
So you need to sit... down where you bend
Cause I'ma just... make your head spin~!

[Chorus] - 2X

So I asked you how you feel, "Girl is everything alright?"
I want you to keep it real, girl you ain't gotta lie
See that dude is a mark a predator and a shark
And I knew that from the start he wanted to break your heart
You ain't got to think twice cause I ain't that type of guy

Let's, be, f'real - c'mon now

Fresh air, I can be the reason why you breathin

He don’t really love you[Hook:Meister-J & Magic]
I'd always try to lose em' when I just got em'
Cause I fall for the wrong, guess I got a problem [x3]
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem
Stop tripping', do the math, maybe you could solve it

[Verse 1: Versice Barnes]
7:30, back before her curfew
The first rules broken, then her brothers hurt you
They encourage you with words, force you to oblige
And that circle in your Wallet better be there all night
Her parent 10% African, at a mass and a fellowship
Let her practice for medicine, and she be checking the testaments
And by test, I meant she checks 'fore she ever lets you in
And her preference depends on whether you're a gentleman
Rather
Carnes Asada
Glass of kulana
Than ever eat with your mama or sip a pint of the lager
She the dream type
Known to a brother as "Ms right"
But at this day and age it's best to stop and think twice
Flirt with the flower, save the nectar for the ending
So I'd think about it for a second
And before I eat a kitkat first sniff the wrapper
Handle all the riffraffs like it don't matter
BEAST

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Magic]

Hol' up, yeah you know we on
Black skinnies and I got my slippers on
Walking through the shadows, yeah I got my fingers crossed
Conversations with mirror, I'm the fairest of them all
Like "mirror, mirror", my competition, ain't never ever been another nigga come between us
No bitches either, or hatin' niggas, or ass niggas, shit, the sound of my voice is enough to make them wither
Cockiness? Something like confidence
I'm the owner of the share, yeah I got the divided
Got your girl in my mouth, I can taste the evidence
Got the medicine in hand, trying to cure my ignorance
So the remedies intact, ain't you fucking generous?
Well you must be supermad thinking you can fuck with us (huh)
Circle of broads, something I need when I'm bored
Should be in a course, like sleeping with better whores, I'm BEAST

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jibbz]

I'm on a "Loo V"
And the other V
You know the ones niggas be claiming they getting G
See I'm a pro, watch and learn, semi-Gs
But you probably not gonna learn cause it's in the genes
Swag, dope on fire, it's simmering
Got y'all niggas blind cause I'm shimmering
When you were with you girl, she was seeing me
I never made a move, then she started leaning in
I could be a cheesy nigga, sweet-talk you
And say shit like "I love to cuddle"
See
There is a risk in that
That could make me be a friend and not a dick in that
Ass
I got a problem, bitch can you slove em' please
I ain't gonna spill if you keep it clean
To something that would make us have kids
I'mma give you that "D" cause you know I'm BEAST

[Hook][Intro]
Aiyyo
We about to bring this from the A-T-L to the S-T-L baby (Beatsta music)
{Ay Jibbs, watch this! Watch this shorty!} What up Fabo~!
Cause she do it with no hands, do it with no hands

[Chorus: Fabo]
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH! OHH! OHH!)

[Jibbs]
Oh snap she done posed for me
That flash run off and she did it on her toes for me
Put on a whole show for me
Like boom boom snap, boom boom snap
To my boom boom clap, boom boom (OHH!)
Fabo told her shake that "Laffy Taffy" and she did exactly
What they do in Georgia, so I brought her across the border
Cause she say she never saw that ARCH befo'
So I showed her how to pose with that six point oh
Yeah that's that new dance
That new dance, that'll make your whole crew dance
And the funny thing about it, she don't even have to move jam
Just jump left, jump right, show that moment
When you boom boom snap in that Kodak moment

[Chorus] - 2X

[Fabo]
She got a smile like a bowlin ball; go crazy when she see that flash
Lights camera action I hear Mystikal when she "Shake it Fast"
I've seen things I ain't never seen with her
I'm Richie Rich, Professor Keenbean gave me her
Violent thoughts in my mind, I'm losin control
She from heaven I'm from Bankhead, OHH! God's blessed me
First time I seen her she was dancin off a Nelly song
Smiled at me right then, I was in the zone
Go up in my station, I'll show you big dipper
Stop, two dollar stop, Fabo show her big zipper OHH!
Girl smile, take a picture if you can
Make it "Tootsie Roll" (what's happenin)
Do it with no hands!!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Jibbs]
Aiyyo.. I was chillin wit my boy Fabo
And I saw this chickalicka
I told her to come hurr, come and get up in this picture
I say smile for me mami and the flash went flicker
She snappin, do three-sixty with her snap dance
She can make it look like a tap dance
I'm in this deal what's happenin~!
Jump to the left, jump to the, jump to jump to
Jump to the right, jump to the, jump to jump to
Take a picture turn around, bump your shoulders up and down
Girl get up in that stance, you can do it with no hands
Pose like a model cause you're so so cute
Then make your body move like you in a photo shoot

[Chorus] - 2X

AY! {*repeat to fade*}* first single

[David Banner]
In the rich corner, heh heh heh
Hailin from Southside St. Louis
The youngest phenomenal feat of all time... Jibbs!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The cars is plush (yeah boii)
Ain't you that bankhead with that big boy truck (yeah boii)
Ain't you that one with money stacked to the ceilin (yeah boii)
And it's a problem when the big kid Jibbs is in the buildin!

[Jibbs]
Yeah, I stay fresh I stay flyer than the rest
Cause when a didn't have much the haters loved to talk mess
But betta yet, I stay flyer than a plane, than a bird
Park my truck on 32's and got it lookin like it ain't a curb
I mean my words, go back-a-wards to that limit
Then I got the girls, goin crazy for the boy
Cause I have no flaws/flurrs, and all the guys say I'm stingy
Because I cannot shurr, I run my city like Diddy
So you can call me Mur', run down you didn't see me comin
You can hear me 'fore you see me cause my Lamborghini hunmin
Got the Hummer behind me and the beats just bumpin
Bangin the concrete, it got'cha A-Town stompin
Aiyyo I represent the South, S-T-L-O-U-I-S man
Where they love to rock them fitted caps and them headbands
My Louis girrls dressed in all white like it's a weddin
And Pookie-Man standin right by my side in black like he the best man

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
I got that S-550 wit that panoramic top
And my different color rims keep spinnin when I stop
Yeah the Kid so flashy just to be my age
But girl don't mind me cause it's just my ways (yeah~!)
What a wonderful day, I'm so icy
And all the other cats wanna be just like me
And that's for the fact that all the girls like me
Lil' mama calm down cause you're gettin a lil' feisty
I got different color cars with my big big bling
With reflections off the wall that make you think you're seein things
And the trunk just thunderin, got everybody rumblin
The truck sittin so high that you could see up under it

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Yeah it's young Jibbs (yeah boii)
And yes I'm curious man I got a question (yeah boii)
Ain't you that big big Kid that all the girls lovin (yeah boii), cause you f'real
When you say diamonds just a button and money ain't nothin
Gettin stacks by the dozen (yeah boii)
Is it true you murderin tracks without cussin (yeah boii)
Everywhere the kid goin it start ruckus (yeah boii)
I heard you somethin like the kid Jay and Puffy, ridin Phantoms is nothin
Ain't that lifestyle lovely? (yeah boii)
Ain't it true that your chain do exotic things (yeah boii)
Colorful diamonds and it flip fo' different ways (yeah boii)
Man Jibbs, you know you gettin paid
And plus I heard that you said that the

[Chorus] - second repeat sans instrumental
