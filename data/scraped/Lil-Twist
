TRANSCRIBING, WILL BE UP SHORTLY

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
The South Side, the South Side, these bitches' mouth wide
Can't trust a pig, informant nigga, run the cop wired
They set us up, then book me up, you crooked fuck
Get to the jail, tell them bitches to look me up
I'm on top of my shit, Red Bottoms like how my shoe tastes
Standin' from where I'm at, the licro is my shoe lace
I chunk a deuce, pour a four all inside an eight ounce
I'm faded now, finna cut a ho off like K Camp
TMZ on my dick, they swear they can knock me off, shit
Harvey better chill 'fore niggas run in his office
Write our own article, tell the people who caused it
Faggot tried to hide, first spot we shot is the closet
Crazy mothafucka, Mossberg in the moshpit
Ever since I hit LA, I'm wildin' on my Pac shit
B.I.G., "Who Shot" shit, or Jay on his Roc shit
"Wop Wop," "Drop It Like It's Hot," "Block Is Hot" shit

[Verse 2: Hood]
Fat Fly Nigga, landing on your runway
Got the work coming, I'm the black Mickey Monday
Snowflake fresher than the morning on a Sunday
I ain't a killer but my homie with the gun play
He the typa kid go to school and kill the lunch La-dy
Damn, crazy right? We the typa kids live a crazy life
We get money, fuck bitches, rock crazy ice
And it's Young Money Records, ho, I'm really with D'wayne
In the club drunk trippin' yelling "Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!"
Boy's insane, top down in the rain
Holding up traffic, shootin' dice in your lane
Niggas shot me in my back, but I'm back bro
No we not a Jack boy, we done jacked bro
Started sellin' crack, now a nigga sellin' crack flows
Meet me in the trap, I'll be right by the back door
You can get a Bow Wow, you can get a Fat Joe
You can get finessed, I'm from Dallas, boy, it's natural
You can get it all for a real pretty penny
Niggas in the hood cookin' chickens, eatin' Denny's
Hoody

[Verse 3: Euro]
Compare me to who? Compare me to what?
Compare me to them, I'm 100, I'm not like them
I'm talkin', been hustlin' before I seen her
Rick Ross video in that off-white Beamer
I'm at the bar taking shots of nightmares with dreamers
Shoot for the stars, hope the moon ain't [?]
Stepped in the game and I spit that ether
And I ain't leaving 'til I blow, funny, these hoes ain't either
Listen, it's February, leaves enough time for me
So by December, I should be a millionaire at least
The least, take my word, this the year I beast
And if not, y'all can kill me by New Years Eve, please

[Verse 4: Flow]
Rollin' blunts while I'm listening to my Jigga disc
Smokin', flickin' ashes from the tip of the pyramid
Dressed in black growing up, horns for my membership
White kid listened to my song then he slit his wrist
I have a nightmare to stop you niggas from dreaming
I never read the bible, but I watch angel and demons
The devil after me? Well fuck it, I'm anxious to meet him
But shhh, shhh, just keep it secret
If I join this force would people stop hatin'?
Should I rap like this to join a Roc Nation
Flow cold like I'm rapping while I'm ice skating
Somebody get me an apron, all of my time wasting
I keep it dirty like Chucks, plus I'm a little Gothic
I spit curses and spells and black nail polish
I fuck gypsies and witches, all of my pals' monsters
Smarter than 12 doctors, sharper than nail filers
Call Satan like fuck it, show me how hell look
I take a nun, then I fuck her like a werewolf
I have no heart, no soul, only these spell books
You niggas' bitches and hoes minus the girl looks
I paint pictures with lyrics so y'all can see my thoughts
Now follow me, in my evil voice
Tweet, Young mother fuckin' Money
These my mother fuckin' brothers, not my fuckin' hubbies

[Verse 5: Cory Gunz]
Militia nigga, you know the name
Cory Gunz, remember my pops era, the son of Dame
The fuck is he supposed to call it
The closer the call is, the closer you going
I'm claustrophobic, your swagger is (?)
Mine is poison, I cough a lotus
Walk New York and show this off
Awesome assault aerobics
You could 80 billion chinups, billion dips and a zillion situps
I stomp you where you at, til' you (?) what it was
Keep me from creeping down the strip bored
Hit for it, jigsaw, clip board
Then I rip your bungees at the zip cord
Pardon my lip lord, can I get my (?)
(?)
Goons smoking (?), lining it raw
Who want it with us
Let me know if its beef nigga
I hope you got the coco leaf or clover leaf
Ain't no competing with these
Niggas from boogie to bang bang boogie
Ain't gangbang for chains, stings, cookies and brains hang
Anythang
Anybody looking to bring pain, maintain
Anybody looking to say name, stay sane
Anybody looking to play games
Ain't wild or worthwhile
Nigga just stay tame

[Verse 6: Gudda Gudda]

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
Smoke, sex, skate, shoot
Boy we turnt up like breakin' news
Let the kids live, baby, dude
Blood all in the fuckin' baby food
The cradle too, shoot the dog once
Turn around, tell the kids, "Stay in school"
Leave out the house, neighbors peekin' out the windows
Show the pistol to the neighbors and the neighbors move
I don't give a fuck about a nigga's caregiver
I be with them niggas that'll fuck their stepsister
I be with them niggas that'll kill your caregiver
I'll do Brazilian wax on a hair trigger
Lord I think I need a hitman
Tell Biggie I'm a big fan
My pockets on Biggie Smalls
Your pockets on stickman
I just came from the gun store
I spent about 10 grand
Now the parents wearin' black clothes
And got your homies wearin' shit bags
Think I need a hitman
'Bout to go kidnap a rich man
If he don't give it up we chop him up
And send his body parts to his house gift wrapped
I think I need a hitman
I can't trust the next man
Thank Lord for my weedman
But right now we're playin' phone tag
I'm doin' 40 down the boulevard
I told my homie he gon' take the charge
He got the Tommy and I got the MAC
And on your head they got a contract
I thank you for my hitman
And tell Pac I'm a big fan
I sang "Dear Mama" to my dear mama
And sang "Hit Em Up" to my daddy's bitch ass
I thank you for my hitman
'Bout to go kidnap the big man
As you can see I got big plans
Big plans to be the big man
40 down the boulevard
With my homies, they gon' take the charge
Say, "It's nothin', boy I got your back"
Because them other niggas copy cats
I thank you for my hitman
This for all my fans that been fans
I'm so sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I'm so sorry for the weight like Slim-Fast
Stick MDMA up a bitch ass
AT&T, ass, tongue and tit man
Oh, oh shit, man
Your pockets on stickman

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne]
It talk like a killer, it walk like a killer
It must be a killer, I must be a killer
Hustlin' Priscilla straight out of the villa
I got more customers shoppin' at Dillards
Don't fuck with these niggas, I don't know their names
Fuck these niggas, I don't give a damn
Fuckin' with Wayne, Talkin' to Wayne
You talkin' to Wayne is like talkin' to flame
22 pop for a brick in the drought
You can't buy the chicken then please chicken out
Or if you snitchin' we will sniff it out
You'll get found at your house, put your dick in your mouth
Dope, skinny ass sweats
Got a strap wear that bitch on my back
I walk in the mall with that shit on my back
With my bitch hollerin' 'bout, "I want this, I want that"
Ooh, mulah
Like la, la, la, la, la, la Too much Cubana up in me cabana
Too much white china and Columbiana
That Columbiana, Zoë Saldaña
Fuck, hollup
I'll be right back, keep the lights on, baby
Leave the lights on, baby
Them niggas play, they'll get wiped off, baby
Like Lysol, baby
I pull up on a bitch wearin' one .38
Put a bitch nigga on First 48
Fuck a bad bitch in the first 24
She take off all her clothes, say she sorry for the wait
Put her legs on a nigga like a hula hoop
I go between her legs like we shootin' hoops
I break a chicken down to some noodle soup
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru, bitch

[Verse 9: Lil Wayne]
Wait bitch, I've been on
Top of my shit, I've been thinkin' 'bout shit
All this lean in my punch got me lickin' a mothafuckin' fist
Lord please don't let my ice melt
Muhfuck these dog hoes
But this 9 on my right leg
Times get hard, nigga I could sell crack to a white egg
Sell wrong to a right end
Nigga it's Carter time and niggas horrified
It's glorified in this bitch
Prioritized and immortalized
I'm on the borderline and it's thin
Hold up I'm lightheaded like a kite, baby
I might, maybe, get life, baby
My light shady, my rice, gravy
My nights daily, my life's crazy

Young Money, homie, YMCMB

And when she think it's right
Then come back to Twist
And we can match it up and have a cash fight
Now I'm balling on em'
Still stunting on em'
In the strip club, still hunching on em'
Still ripping bands, homie buy these grands

Niggas with money, and money your savings

If you a pimp, break a bitch

I see you looking, what you looking at?
All out of pocket, ho, I'm taking that
You know the life? Bitch, I'm living that
Now do that 100 yard dash and run that money back
I see potential, yeah, you full of that
Be my employee of the week, make a hundred racks
I'm in the Benz, fuck a 'Lac
Space age pimpin', know you heard of that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ah! She want a nigga like a Birkin purse
Fuck it like it's my last pussy on the universe
Give you that work, she give me checks like it's every first
Of the month, I got liquor for these bitches' thirst
Put you on stars, you'll be shinin' in your turf
My nigga told me bout ya, had to see what you was worth
That pussy come a dime a dozen, you'll be mine, you know it
Why he got you working? I could benefit you further
You know that Lambo, broke-poof, lame niggas, ain't no
Competition when I'm spittin' game that could break hoes
Hoes gotta bow in my presence for survival
Mindfreak, no Criss Angel up in this flow
Real magic, make a dollar touch to her ankles
My bitch'll take a train, bus for this dick though
Fall asleep when I bust, blowin' kush bowls
Got another bitch comin', so hit the back door, bitch, you know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YG]
I'm a mack, baby, spin that crack, baby
Too much money, I'll never fuck a fat lady
Now, that's a fact, baby, sit on my lap, baby
You know the motto: bust a nut then take a nap, baby
You know the motto: if you come through, fuck a nigga
She keep bringing up her boyfriend, I'm like "fuck yo' nigga"
(Hold up!) Ooh, you nasty
Do I like it from the back? That's what she asked me (yep)
What you know about suntans from Blood niggas?
Dressed in all black like Catholic nun niggas
What you know about that Porsche plus that hundred racks?
My old bitch mad, she ain't getting none of that!
Dick don't fail me now, I gotta turn this bitch out
Cause, if I beat that pussy up...
She gon' give me everything in her bank account (400!)

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Twist]
If you a pimp, break a bitch
See, I'mma mack on this motherfucking ho one time, ay (x2)
See, I'mma mack on this motherfucking ho one time[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I put the kush in the stogie, yeah, I put the Bentley in Drive
I'm pulling out the garage, and thanking God I'm alive
I've been through so much shit, been through trouble and back
I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't going back
These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me
I left the jail in Givenchy, they should have posted that homie
I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz
I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang
Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up
This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck
In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill - no duh
My whip game insane uh Ferrari Testarossa's
Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome
I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it
Like when KG went to Boston
Or when Melo went to the Knicks
And he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin'
Big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in New Orleans
Let me take a break, let me catch my breath
Rolling with the Birdman homie, it's YM over everything
Nigga, I don't need nothing else
It's Lil Twist, nigga, I'm checked in
I fucked homegirl and her best friend
You don't wanna miss out on your blessing
Got the dope dick and I use it as a weapon
I just

[Hook]
Shooter, BANG (x5)

[Verse 2: Euro]
Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan, Michael Tyson
Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson
Might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around, it might go platinum
How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether
Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features
See I'm doing it again, got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend
No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in
Because niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim
Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him
All I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching
Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin
Gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win
The room's spinning cause I'm faded
Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related
I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it
Fuck me without paying the rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's
Money always been the main attraction
Homie told me women always been the main distraction
And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed
I'm busy making millions and she just started laughing
So you know I had to

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
When I'm mad is when I don’t even wana mask on
War paint like a baboon and my bitch got a red ass on
Young Money Cash Money to the dirt of me
So for certainly I'mma get my blast on
To the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us
Think they can make it if they can run a decathlon
Stay blazing, I mack on, play brave and get back home
With them AK's, crack arms with a straight face, that calm
And I fain gaze and attack on with a straight razor in that palm
Any nigga want it he gotta get it
The Yappa got it rolling and rocking with it
I got a nigga showing and popping, picking and going
Packing a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and boom
Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's
You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs
Looking the nose off, looking like I'm flicking the stove off
When I'm kicking the stove off, kicking the doors off
Everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off
Say making a remarkable pay
Meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay
Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may
Fucking killing unbook, come the coppers and spray
Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hopping the gate
If you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face
You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe
Sorry to say, no eye witness, you finish you gotta bang

[Hook][Hook - Lil Twist]
I’m dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it’s just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can’t
Tell my girl but I won't
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy

[Verse 1 - Lil Twist]
Fatal attraction, ready for action
She had a body like Ms. Jackson
I knew there was trouble when she passed by
But she was so fly
She invited me over
So I hopped in the Rover
Then my lady called the phone
And I should of went home
But I let the phone roam

[Bridge - Lil Twist]
And it was like…
Oooohhhhh
I can’t keep my shirt on
I swear it was like…
Oooohhhh
I can’t keep my hands to myself

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Lil Twist]
I swear that I was done
I’m never going back
Then she called me up
She said I left my hat
You know I can’t live without my hat
I got an excuse to go back y’all
So you know I’m gon’ have a ball
I said I’m going back y’all
Believe me that’s not all

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Uh, I got a main bitch and a mistress
I’m trying to work it out, I’m on my fitness
Probably won’t last, but I’m optimistic
One makes me happy, the other makes a difference
I ain’t a player, but I love a lot
She loves me, she loves me not
But it feel good, and it’s not supposed to
I eat her insides, mmm soul food
She put her head back, then her eyes close
We stuck in the moment like the time froze
Then my girl call, back to reality
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery, oh!

[Bridge + Hook][Verse 1:Lil Za]
I can't imagine what it's like with you, all I'm askin' can a nigga spend a night with you. Not really in the mood, well I got some weed. Well actually mine, but after that, it's white wine. That's right. I know what they like. No I'm not the prototype, just livin' by the motto type. You know, YOLO right? Shit I'm fuckin' with you though,I know you thinkin' like this nigga think I'm some kinda ho. But no, I really don't, I just think that you deserve it.

Where the bad bitches at, gon' smoke?
Where the bad bitches at, gon' drank?
Where the bad bitches at that twerk?
Put them weak bitches out that can't
Look at shawty right there with them quirks
Got me tryin' not to scratch my paint
And when she shake that ass, I throw more cash
Swear she tryna get a piece of my bank
Back it up, back it up, bust it open, wide open, baby girl
Let me see what you're workin' with
Me and T on some pimp shit, this is the collision
My nigga at the front, I'm at the tail end, where is your girlfriend?
I'm lookin to surf in, try puttin' a word in
I jump in that pussy and turn that shit to a whirlwind
I'm Twizzy F Baby, Mr. Freestyle Murder
I'ma kill you little niggas but the pussy, I'm murkin' 'em
Let me slow it up
Y'all already know what's up
Been gettin' paid since a young age
Now that's young money, watch me throw it up
I'm in King of Diamonds like what the fuck?
Throwin' stacks at her, throwin' racks at her
And don't worry 'bout it, girl, if I'm old enough
Just gon' do me a favor, girl, back it up

[Hook: Lil Twist]
Back it up
Girl back it up (x3)
Girl back it up
Gon' do me a favor, girl back it up
I'm throwin' stacks at her, throwin' racks at her
Don't worry 'bout it, girl, if I'm old enough
Just gon' do me a favor, girl, back it up

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
Let me see you do it, girl work the pole
Gon' get this money, girl twerk it slow
Let me see it though, let me see it though
Yeah I'm talkin' bendin' over, girl touch your toes
Now strike a pose, then drop it low
I'm in the strip club with my big bro
Named Weezy F, and we do it the best
Already 60 racks and leave the floor messy
Young Money, homie, YMCMB
Got a brown tone for the T-Streets
I need 3 more for Chris, B and T
I'm a fool with it, just a young elite
Shit, what the Hell? You can't blame me
This the fast life, get your cash right
And when she think it's right
Then come back to Twist
And we can match it up and have a cash fight
Now I'm balling on em'
Still stunting on em'
In the strip club, still hunching on em'
Still ripping bands, homie buy these grands
Im the young boss, follow my commands
Now I'm bring bought seven hands
Back to my table, racks on racks to my naval
Got all the girls wanna rock the young boy like a cradle, Well!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Auggh!!
Girl back it up, b-back it up
Im hard as fuck and I wanna fuck
Bitch open up, I'm to-to raw gotta rap it up
I'm ultra faded, I'm pouring cups
Two shots of this, ass shots on her
Don't ask for nothing, let me throw it up
Man she all on my balls like bowling bruh
Auggh!!
I'm more than amazing, with the location, a lot of caucasians
Niggas with money, and money your savings
Bout' my business, nigga no blazer
Why you tryna save her, nigga I slave her
While you pay her, I get paper
Got hoes lined up like a taper
Back to back I call that Laker, huh!
P-pop a pill, do it big
Bend it over, I see it's real
Drizzy voice, young money ill
I low my dick, then auto-kill
She know it's real
Man I got that cake, happy belated
I styling on my ex, let my nigga Twizzy say it, huh!

[Hook]Ball Out Lyrics

[Intro]
Said we ball out
We ball out
Said we ball out
We ball out
[Kid Ink Verse]
Yeah, but you will never catch me out of bounds
Or at home, it’s no guess I’m probably out of town
Cause my weight game is so Dwayne Wade
Getting money checks looking like a sweepstake
Pull up in a space ship star wars fly
With an all back diamond chain from the dark side
Lot of cheese like Swiss
Tell’em that it’s your time
Moneys all I talk and you ain't telling nothing like mine

[Hook]X2
Man look at my chain man
Look at my ring man
This ice around my neck got me looking insane man
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
[Lil Twist Verse]
You can tell that we ball out
Go buy the mall out
We go the big money way
We never go small routes
You can tell that we ball out (ball out, ball out)
You call us
We hit your city and club and bring Barbies’ and dolls out
What you bout
This our house
And this how we does it
This young money baby never put nothin’ above it
Yeah now tell them haters fall back
I pull out that jewelry box and show them all that

[Hook]X2
Man look at my chain man
Look at my ring man
This ice around my neck got me looking insane man
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
[Lil Twist Verse]
Check, check
I do it all day like I never ever did it before
Spending my money like it grow on trees
That’s why I say bout time to dig mo’ holes (yeah)
But I’m still riding in a Rolls (yeah)
Collecting dough at my shows (yeah)
Take the dough to the crib turn them into seeds bout time to fill these holes (yeah)
Tell me what you know about me (yeah)
I earned this like a G (yeah)
T W I S T tryna go to the college and get his degree (yeah)
But the ice distract me
Diamonds so tacky
Bout to go to the mall and spend and spend like a G
Now haters Lo-Look

[Hook]X2
Man look at my chain man
Look at my ring man
This ice around my neck got me looking insane man
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I put the kush in the stogie, yeah, I put the Bentley in Drive
I'm pulling out the garage, and thanking God I'm alive
I've been through so much shit, been through trouble and back
I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't going back
These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me
I left the jail in Givenchy, they should have posted that homie
I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz
I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang
Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up
This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck
In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill - no duh
My whip game insane uh Ferrari Testarossa's
Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome
I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it
Like when KG went to Boston
Or when Melo went to the Knicks
And he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin'
Big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in New Orleans
Let me take a break, let me catch my breath
Rolling with the Birdman homie, it's YM over everything
Nigga, I don't need nothing else
It's Lil Twist, nigga, I'm checked in
I fucked homegirl and her best friend
You don't wanna miss out on your blessing
Got the dope dick and I use it as a weapon
I just

[Hook]
Shooter, BANG (x5)

[Verse 2: Euro]
Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan, Michael Tyson
Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson
Might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around, it might go platinum
How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether
Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features
See I'm doing it again, got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend
No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in
Because niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim
Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him
All I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching
Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin
Gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win
The room's spinning cause I'm faded
Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related
I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it
Fuck me without paying the rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's
Money always been the main attraction
Homie told me women always been the main distraction
And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed
I'm busy making millions and she just started laughing
So you know I had to

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
When I'm mad is when I don’t even wana mask on
War paint like a baboon and my bitch got a red ass on
Young Money Cash Money to the dirt of me
So for certainly I'mma get my blast on
To the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us
Think they can make it if they can run a decathlon
Stay blazing, I mack on, play brave and get back home
With them AK's, crack arms with a straight face, that calm
And I fain gaze and attack on with a straight razor in that palm
Any nigga want it he gotta get it
The Yappa got it rolling and rocking with it
I got a nigga showing and popping, picking and going
Packing a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and boom
Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's
You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs
Looking the nose off, looking like I'm flicking the stove off
When I'm kicking the stove off, kicking the doors off
Everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off
Say making a remarkable pay
Meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay
Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may
Fucking killing unbook, come the coppers and spray
Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hopping the gate
If you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face
You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe
Sorry to say, no eye witness, you finish you gotta bang

And I am young mula and so is twisty baby
And don't you ever forget that and don't forget the baby
Gone[Verse 1: Lil Twist]

I told her baby you can spend the night
That's when she dropped her shit and said I ain't gotta tell her twice,
Well alright, you gon' be better by the end of the night
"Well alright", is what she said and then she hit the pipe...
Or spoke in to the mic...
Or what else can I say my nigga she got my soldiers hype
Got me wanna record this shit, somebody call hype...
Cover girl, centerfold, that be the youngin' type
And we can go all night

[Hook: Khalil]

Baby you gone fall in love (love)
By the end of the night (by the end of the night)

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]

And as I slowly start to take 'em down
She already wet and already making sounds (Whew)
Now I can't wait to get all in it
Bout to give it to this chick like she ain't, had it in minutes
For a few minutes...
Maybe even an hour
From the beds to the showers to going down like picking flowers...
Roses, tulips... turned to 4 lips
From the ones that's on her face to kissing the lips beneath her hips
Now it's time to get down and dirty
Just don't bite though
And yeah I got protection
Gloved up like Micheal
Now that I'm strapped, let's get it poppin' like a riffle
And you can get on top , i'll let you ride this fucking psycho
Bull, maniaco. now we sippin' peno, gresio, fine wine, that's for our fine time...
And baby girl this your world (ha)
Just kinda mine
But right now, it's based on your time

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Twist]

Fatal attraction
Ready for action...
She had a body like Ms Jackson...
And I knew that it was trouble when she passed by...
But she was so fly...
[2X]

[Hook]Lets try this again
Hawaiin punch

Uhh the youngest in charge
My pockets get large
A new whip every day
You can check my garage
Jeep sitting high
And that benz is super charge
I ain't say they were mine
But look we living large
Fresh Range, Simpson Yellow, like im rolling Marge
White cracker's diamonds singing like young El DeBarge
Coming back with the black
I don't know how to act
Mister casual flow
But I don't know how to slack
I'm rolling Bugatti shhh
I don't know how to 'lac
Unless I'm getting drove around, but look we audit that
If I'm in the Escalade
That mean I'm getting paid
If you knock 3 times or more, that means I'm getting laid
Shout out to Rose', free Weezy all day
YMCM be my team, on top like toopes
I kill him off, kill him off like first 48
Just give me one of those
If I need two days for drop my gun
Run in a store, have my fun, throw 'em on the floor
Open the door, give me all a day and more
Open your pocket you whore
Now sorry if I just swore
But I'm just hungry and no, I'm not poor
That's what I came here for
And no, not because I needed more

It's my time to shine
But it's my time to show who I'm is
Twist on every girls wish list
How the hell could you diss this ahh

Let, let the beat break in
Tired of these dudes faking
All these other dudes hating
When truthfully I fly angel wings
That are hotter than Satan

Cooler than cool and amazing
And all hell is what I'm raising
I'm chilling on a vacation
With a Jamaican, Asian, Caucasian, Casian
I mean Cuban, Rick Ruben
We cruising, we winning, ya'll losing
Cause we working, while ya'll snoozing
Checks coming every week and I'm tired of moving
To get to the money is something I can't get tired of doing
So I'm gonna keep going till I can't
And I ain't gonna stop till the bank on lock, MAN

Slow up, slow up, show up, show up
Here I go, Twizzy F
When down with the tape, name T rappers
Oh wait is their any left?
Slow up, slow down ya
This how I move it round and
You didn't like me then
And I can only imagine how you like me now
Twist

Niggas don't want it with us
You see Young Money with us
You should be running with us
Instead of running from us
You see us doing it big
So you be puffing your cheek
And every time she speak
You know she mention Lil' TwistTRANSCRIBING, WILL BE UP SHORTLY

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
The South Side, the South Side, these bitches' mouth wide
Can't trust a pig, informant nigga, run the cop wired
They set us up, then book me up, you crooked fuck
Get to the jail, tell them bitches to look me up
I'm on top of my shit, Red Bottoms like how my shoe tastes
Standin' from where I'm at, the licro is my shoe lace
I chunk a deuce, pour a four all inside an eight ounce
I'm faded now, finna cut a ho off like K Camp
TMZ on my dick, they swear they can knock me off, shit
Harvey better chill 'fore niggas run in his office
Write our own article, tell the people who caused it
Faggot tried to hide, first spot we shot is the closet
Crazy mothafucka, Mossberg in the moshpit
Ever since I hit LA, I'm wildin' on my Pac shit
B.I.G., "Who Shot" shit, or Jay on his Roc shit
"Wop Wop," "Drop It Like It's Hot," "Block Is Hot" shit

[Verse 2: Hood]
Fat Fly Nigga, landing on your runway
Got the work coming, I'm the black Mickey Monday
Snowflake fresher than the morning on a Sunday
I ain't a killer but my homie with the gun play
He the typa kid go to school and kill the lunch La-dy
Damn, crazy right? We the typa kids live a crazy life
We get money, fuck bitches, rock crazy ice
And it's Young Money Records, ho, I'm really with D'wayne
In the club drunk trippin' yelling "Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!"
Boy's insane, top down in the rain
Holding up traffic, shootin' dice in your lane
Niggas shot me in my back, but I'm back bro
No we not a Jack boy, we done jacked bro
Started sellin' crack, now a nigga sellin' crack flows
Meet me in the trap, I'll be right by the back door
You can get a Bow Wow, you can get a Fat Joe
You can get finessed, I'm from Dallas, boy, it's natural
You can get it all for a real pretty penny
Niggas in the hood cookin' chickens, eatin' Denny's
Hoody

[Verse 3: Euro]
Compare me to who? Compare me to what?
Compare me to them, I'm 100, I'm not like them
I'm talkin', been hustlin' before I seen her
Rick Ross video in that off-white Beamer
I'm at the bar taking shots of nightmares with dreamers
Shoot for the stars, hope the moon ain't [?]
Stepped in the game and I spit that ether
And I ain't leaving 'til I blow, funny, these hoes ain't either
Listen, it's February, leaves enough time for me
So by December, I should be a millionaire at least
The least, take my word, this the year I beast
And if not, y'all can kill me by New Years Eve, please

[Verse 4: Flow]
Rollin' blunts while I'm listening to my Jigga disc
Smokin', flickin' ashes from the tip of the pyramid
Dressed in black growing up, horns for my membership
White kid listened to my song then he slit his wrist
I have a nightmare to stop you niggas from dreaming
I never read the bible, but I watch angel and demons
The devil after me? Well fuck it, I'm anxious to meet him
But shhh, shhh, just keep it secret
If I join this force would people stop hatin'?
Should I rap like this to join a Roc Nation
Flow cold like I'm rapping while I'm ice skating
Somebody get me an apron, all of my time wasting
I keep it dirty like Chucks, plus I'm a little Gothic
I spit curses and spells and black nail polish
I fuck gypsies and witches, all of my pals' monsters
Smarter than 12 doctors, sharper than nail filers
Call Satan like fuck it, show me how hell look
I take a nun, then I fuck her like a werewolf
I have no heart, no soul, only these spell books
You niggas' bitches and hoes minus the girl looks
I paint pictures with lyrics so y'all can see my thoughts
Now follow me, in my evil voice
Tweet, Young mother fuckin' Money
These my mother fuckin' brothers, not my fuckin' hubbies

[Verse 5: Cory Gunz]
Militia nigga, you know the name
Cory Gunz, remember my pops era, the son of Dame
The fuck is he supposed to call it
The closer the call is, the closer you going
I'm claustrophobic, your swagger is (?)
Mine is poison, I cough a lotus
Walk New York and show this off
Awesome assault aerobics
You could 80 billion chinups, billion dips and a zillion situps
I stomp you where you at, til' you (?) what it was
Keep me from creeping down the strip bored
Hit for it, jigsaw, clip board
Then I rip your bungees at the zip cord
Pardon my lip lord, can I get my (?)
(?)
Goons smoking (?), lining it raw
Who want it with us
Let me know if its beef nigga
I hope you got the coco leaf or clover leaf
Ain't no competing with these
Niggas from boogie to bang bang boogie
Ain't gangbang for chains, stings, cookies and brains hang
Anythang
Anybody looking to bring pain, maintain
Anybody looking to say name, stay sane
Anybody looking to play games
Ain't wild or worthwhile
Nigga just stay tame

[Verse 6: Gudda Gudda]

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
Smoke, sex, skate, shoot
Boy we turnt up like breakin' news
Let the kids live, baby, dude
Blood all in the fuckin' baby food
The cradle too, shoot the dog once
Turn around, tell the kids, "Stay in school"
Leave out the house, neighbors peekin' out the windows
Show the pistol to the neighbors and the neighbors move
I don't give a fuck about a nigga's caregiver
I be with them niggas that'll fuck their stepsister
I be with them niggas that'll kill your caregiver
I'll do Brazilian wax on a hair trigger
Lord I think I need a hitman
Tell Biggie I'm a big fan
My pockets on Biggie Smalls
Your pockets on stickman
I just came from the gun store
I spent about 10 grand
Now the parents wearin' black clothes
And got your homies wearin' shit bags
Think I need a hitman
'Bout to go kidnap a rich man
If he don't give it up we chop him up
And send his body parts to his house gift wrapped
I think I need a hitman
I can't trust the next man
Thank Lord for my weedman
But right now we're playin' phone tag
I'm doin' 40 down the boulevard
I told my homie he gon' take the charge
He got the Tommy and I got the MAC
And on your head they got a contract
I thank you for my hitman
And tell Pac I'm a big fan
I sang "Dear Mama" to my dear mama
And sang "Hit Em Up" to my daddy's bitch ass
I thank you for my hitman
'Bout to go kidnap the big man
As you can see I got big plans
Big plans to be the big man
40 down the boulevard
With my homies, they gon' take the charge
Say, "It's nothin', boy I got your back"
Because them other niggas copy cats
I thank you for my hitman
This for all my fans that been fans
I'm so sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I'm so sorry for the weight like Slim-Fast
Stick MDMA up a bitch ass
AT&T, ass, tongue and tit man
Oh, oh shit, man
Your pockets on stickman

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne]
It talk like a killer, it walk like a killer
It must be a killer, I must be a killer
Hustlin' Priscilla straight out of the villa
I got more customers shoppin' at Dillards
Don't fuck with these niggas, I don't know their names
Fuck these niggas, I don't give a damn
Fuckin' with Wayne, Talkin' to Wayne
You talkin' to Wayne is like talkin' to flame
22 pop for a brick in the drought
You can't buy the chicken then please chicken out
Or if you snitchin' we will sniff it out
You'll get found at your house, put your dick in your mouth
Dope, skinny ass sweats
Got a strap wear that bitch on my back
I walk in the mall with that shit on my back
With my bitch hollerin' 'bout, "I want this, I want that"
Ooh, mulah
Like la, la, la, la, la, la Too much Cubana up in me cabana
Too much white china and Columbiana
That Columbiana, Zoë Saldaña
Fuck, hollup
I'll be right back, keep the lights on, baby
Leave the lights on, baby
Them niggas play, they'll get wiped off, baby
Like Lysol, baby
I pull up on a bitch wearin' one .38
Put a bitch nigga on First 48
Fuck a bad bitch in the first 24
She take off all her clothes, say she sorry for the wait
Put her legs on a nigga like a hula hoop
I go between her legs like we shootin' hoops
I break a chicken down to some noodle soup
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru, bitch

[Verse 9: Lil Wayne]
Wait bitch, I've been on
Top of my shit, I've been thinkin' 'bout shit
All this lean in my punch got me lickin' a mothafuckin' fist
Lord please don't let my ice melt
Muhfuck these dog hoes
But this 9 on my right leg
Times get hard, nigga I could sell crack to a white egg
Sell wrong to a right end
Nigga it's Carter time and niggas horrified
It's glorified in this bitch
Prioritized and immortalized
I'm on the borderline and it's thin
Hold up I'm lightheaded like a kite, baby
I might, maybe, get life, baby
My light shady, my rice, gravy
My nights daily, my life's crazy
Lil Tunechi, bitch[Hook: Lil Twist] (x2)
Now, I got money in my pocket, I can buy whatever that I want
Whips in the garage, I can drive whatever that I want
Females in the club, I can get whoever that I want
I do anything I want, I do anything
Now, I got money in my pocket, I can buy whatever that I want
Whips in the garage, I can drive whatever that I want
Females in the club, I can get whoever that I want
I get anything I want, I get anything I want

[Bridge: Lil Twist]
I get it (x8), I do it (x8)

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I'm swagging out on them hoes and all them hoes be all in my shows
C-coming out of they clothes
You can't get mad your chick gon' go, that's just how the shit goes
And, plus, she in love with all of my bros cause real niggas always get chose
They steady stealing my flows, swag, rapping like they dope, nah
Been done that before, so I'm more like a swagger coach
Niggas throwing salt on me, laid up, pillow talking bout me
Don't you wish you was YMCMB?
When they look in the mirror, I'm all they see
Hah, T-dub-I-S-T F, he fresh
My bro Khaled say "we the best", fully game, I don't need a ref
My chauffeur drive down Ocean Drive, yeah, sunroof, I open mine
I can't stop, I won't stop, I put in work, that (overtime)

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Pants came with them horseshoes, rest in peace to her hairdo
While I'm getting a lapdance, I'm so ahead of my lap view
This right here is that trigger language - that fire-fire! - I ain't even aiming
I shoot yo' ass in different places then I leave yo' ass in different places!
My life, your entertainment, ignore the ignoramus
My girl speak a different language, in magazines, I'm on different pages
Ace of Spades, different cases, drug court, different cases
Kill yo' ass, steal yo' ass, rebuild yo' ass, renovation!
Get money demonstration, valet parked at the central station
Y'all don't know my situation so it's "fuck y'all", penetration!
Mayo, mustard, can't catch up to my separation
And, now that my nigga is out the feds, we a motherfuckin' federation!

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro: Lil Twist]
Tried to tell y'all, I do it, I do it, yeah
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Riding round and I'm getting it

(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
Now lady can I get a taste?

Rollin, pullin' old ladies
Straight jammin' Golden Child, middle finger out the window

Don't worry about nothin (baby girl, I got you)
When I touch back down I'mma buy you everything
You ain't gotta want for nothin (cause girl, I got you)
Ha, don't worry what your friends say cause they be hatin anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl, I got you)
Ha! It's just me and you against the world baby girl
I know you got my back (cause girl, I got you)

[Lil Twist]
As I was walkin by I seen you standin there with a smile
Lookin shy, caught my eye, thought you wanna hang a while
I-15 on the beat and I ain't cruisin highways
So baby let's get away, save the troubles for another day
Ha! Jammin "Escapade" in the lot
With Escalade on the back, your homie's whack, I promise that
It ain't trickin if you got it might as well spend a stack
I hit the mall and ball down call me young Steven Jackson
And I'm the one and I won with no games played
Never have to work in our life, babe we got it made
Every day's a vaca', in Miami like Dade
And we ain't ever clean up baby cause I got maids
Ha! Young money we so paid
And if you ever get hurt, baby I'm ya Band-Aid
Ha! While I'm lookin at you
Never worry about nuthin cause girl, I got you

[Hook]

[Lil Chuckee]
Shorty I'm here any time that you need me
F'sheezy, I'm here to make your life... easy
They say to every good dude there's a good lady
And I have mine already ain't no need to keep lookin
Ha! And when I'm on the road, you go to my house
And walk my bulldog, and help my moms out
And play with my sister, you know I love that
That's why whatever you want, I'mma cop that
I'm your Rashad, you my NewNew
I'm ya Will Smith, baby you my Jada Pooh
And when I'm in the studio you come chill wit me
Play around with my hair, you keep me motivated
If we had a team, I'd be Reggie Bush
You'd be Kim Kardashian, your body so amazin
And when I'm not wit'cha, I'm on my iPod
Bumpin "Forever My Lady," I love ya girl~!

[Hook] - 2X[Verse 1: Lil Twist]

Ugh I get that cake light then I shine
I show my swagg they tryna take mine
Its Twizzy Baby in the right mind
Switchin out hoes like playing date line
Ima do this here for for my team Y-Y-YMCMB
And girl I gots a lot of green
So put that pussy all on me
Since a youngin baby one hundred baby
Everything they doing I been done it baby
I dont rock with them and Im underrated
But they washed up like the laundry lady
Ima young nigga with old paper
I stay high as a skyscraper
And me I scream eff a hater
Who needs them they're annihilated
Been round the world and back ho
You can tell from the way I act doe
Gotta new girl for each state
You can tell Im Wayne and Mac bro
Twizzy F leave nothin left
Cause I lay em down by myself
Bill Gates wealth made hearts melt
Got em watchin me like Rockwell
Im goin in you ain't gotta tell me
Since a youngster gettin mad bread like a deli
Hit the club make it flood like a broke levy
Leave the club with a set of twins like Mary Mary
Hit the Telli get it poppin let em know how Twizzy rockin
Soon as we done lettin em rock
Two minutes past couple mo knocking
Rockstar lifestyle I tried to be the nice child
Still made it now half a Mill in my bank account shit keep hatin

[Hook]
Godzilla, Godzilla, I swear to god I'm as hard as Godzilla
Godzilla, Godzilla, I'm a monster, I swear to god nigga
Godzilla, Godzilla, I swear to god I'm as hard as Godzilla
Godzilla, Godzilla, bigger than life

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]

Look, stop comparing, I'm better
Young money forever
Gold around my neck look like I found me fucking treasure
Balling with no turnovers but you just gaining several
And for instance I'm something like Sheed and you something like Webber
Damn, Me hungry for what I want so watch me get it, get it
Luxury living Miami drive benz kitty
They say I'm a kid, but I Ain't kidding, no not at all and uhh
Big money tall, crib big as the taj mahal
T.O.S to the death of me that's ef-ing mean, can't believe I spent 600 on
This ef-ing jeans get your money right, I got my money right
Spend ten in one night
Spend 5 on your sister flight
Do what I do, give her to my crew give her back in the same night
I do it like no other, I say I'm mighty blessed
Plus I'm hard to impress, protégée of the best

[Hook]
Godzilla, Godzilla, I swear to god I'm as hard as Godzilla
Godzilla, Godzilla, I'm a monster, I swear to god nigga
Godzilla, Godzilla, I swear to god I'm as hard as Godzilla
Godzilla, Godzilla, bigger than life
