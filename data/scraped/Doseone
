[Verse 1: Yoni Wolf]
As I lay me down to fall asleep
With my demons dying
And my pilot light weak
I curse the last six months
I've been hiding behind a mustache
Yeah
And to those last 10 years
I've been howling a paper moon
Well fuck you

[Hook 1]
This goes out to all my underdone
Other-tongued
Lung-long frontmen
(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says [DOSEONE])
And all us earth growths
Some planted
And some pulled
(Shut up and put your money where your mouth is [DOSEONE])

[Verse 2: Yoni Wolf]
You shine a flashlight in
A hat box and spin
An empty oyster shell
And celebrate the hollows

[Hook 2]
This goes out to dirty-dancing, cursing
Back-masking, back-slidden pastor's kids
(From behind bars its not so hard to see he's risen [DOSEONE])
And all us earth growths
Some planted
And some pulled
(Nobody finds god and then goes to prison [DOSEONE])

[Verse 3: Yoni Wolf]
In Berlin I saw two men fuck
In the dark corner of a basketball court
Just a slight jingle
Of pocket change pulsing
In the tourist park I lost 50 euros
To a guy with the walnut shells
And the marble
It really pissed me off
So I thought I'd go back
To get my money
But all my homies warned me
"Oh no, those gypsies
Prolly got knives"

[Hook 3]
This goes out to all my under-brewed
Double-duped, two-time truth-fools
(Stop thinking a phone call
Or text is too complicated [DOSEONE])
And all us earth growths
Some planted
(Like a married uncle at a family function [DOSEONE])
And some pulled

[Bridge: Yoni Wolf]
I got them shaky gums and a couple of loose tooths
Now tell me what should I do?
My God, the clock's always
Stuck tellin' 11:11, at 3:32

[Hook 1]
(Even just Joanna Newsom's left hand
Could beat the pants off your best man [DOSEONE])

[Hook 1]
(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says [DOSEONE])
And all us earth growths
Doin' the croak
Like it ain't no joke

[Outro]
In a crowded room projected debonair
Aloof impermanence
He shrouded loosely
In a heavy air of indeterminance[Doseone]
Empty
Things
She's calling
She's calling me tonight
From just inside my lips
And
I'll write her
Betterment of the world through wish
Wish I'd
Fall off, growing distant
I'll write her
And pull my face fresh
From the waxy palms it's kept soft in

[Why?]
There's something
To the fading of faith
My whole childhood
Was the broken guitar
And my sister's silly
Yellow blanket
Now I carry
Slender and sexy curved
Sledge hammers
To break the bricks
I bought
I should have never went to college
But took a trip to Costa Rica
To cut rainforests
To choke myself

[Doseone]
Making up Miss Bobafetet as I go along

[Why?]
And rejecting the truths that I've been served

[Doseone]
Fool in
Besides
Tuition for my countenance
Pressed fine in reverse block
Style print
A product
Of cave drawings
Gone automated
With these loafers and a check book
Twisted tightly into... into
I know
A stiletto

[Doseone and why?]
Do you know how many times
I've thought about writing about the paper I'm writing on?

[Why?]
I lost my liquid tongue for the wet pen

[Doseone]
I have one mortal wish

[Why?]
I don't even know where i've been
(in the basement, hugging the gas main.)
Something's been left out of this game
God, did you remember to render everything?
I've seen 1078 sundays and
7 borders where the liquid meets land
I've even seen stars
Now where the fuck
Is anti-emptiness?

[Dose one]
I'm leaking into stoned and severed existence

[Why?]
I've been consumed by my own breath

[Illogic]
Change of face, shapeless
Personality switch, transformation
So impersonation of self leads
Crowds in twos to disintegration
Who's in the basement choking a puppet on the pedestal?
Let a stool pigeon escort those who contort
Three doors down into the left door on the right hand side
My hand slides into pockets
Pull sockets of lead penalty

Orbs of red energy
Entering the orbit of the morbid
Northern and southern hemispheres of play caps
Place time bombs and rose stems on your axle
Clear case
Hole in faded ozone layer of doom
Sphere of babylon shield
Towering above gravity
Taking up space in a residence of stars

[Dose one]
A touching story of ungrateful velcro skulled boy
With his tored-off face
And the life-sized sacked marionette
He'd thought looked an awful lot like him
(with his time told and mildewed
Baby clothes of a business man.)
Jerk... wackoff slumped
And he's tired, sick with bad posturing
One can't hold in
Oh hell, there's a king of jungle in him yet
Give our young lad middle of america's valise
But spare the gauze, he's losing poet by the gallon
Glory, Glory
Bottom of the quicksand's gonna give him a
Whole lot less to think about
Than change that steel trap perspective would
Perhaps

I ain't a scared no more, to make a' the difference
Stolen heart, and a whole wide world to blame

[Why?]
I've been
Living
In a record
Skipped filmstrip

I'm falling off the side of the boat
And when I hit water
I'm falling off the side of the boat
I fall asleep hoping
Tomorrow tastes like poems and honeysuckle
I move slow cause the sky looks bluer
When you fuck the order of the day
Or the way the shelves were meant to fit
I wish I had a pair of stilts to wear
While I play the flute in some
Light-traffic hallway in my old high school

But these are only threats to the seated self
Maybe Spain is the open-faced smile
From some life I saw in a movie
And always thought i'd live

[Doseone]
Jackpot!

[Illogic]
Congratulations!

[Why?]
Space is potent

(Well or, and this is, New York City)
Where the shiftiest sources leak out the back door
For more and this is New York City
(Oh, I see these hear walk
I, simply a shade of shepherd
Seems we share fate, honestly)
Oh, now wait a minute
I notice there making mockeries of mad men
Tend not to bend in the honesty
My twenty thousand leagues ending grants sardonic fatigue
(The view from this here segue crowds a listeners nothing special simply
Listeners, how we dissolve its spores and I'll tell you not flying)
And I live beneath the scenic yeah, where the fossils pledged allegiance
Where the centipedes and serpents bigot on territorial disagreements
The uprooted turned moody and hacked pleasure to skinny ribbons and I'll
Suckle my skull caught beneath assumptions pumping pistons
(Left the joke to wick, it
He walks whose out now, we, Aesop walls up)
We tune out the pouts of hiding
Twilight street merchants, we, deity freely and been here before...

Murder, of holy, in cushion
Partisan, part of the ceiling seems to be leaking, oh, oh, it's the wall
Forbid box been broken, from man of everywhere, that's what I sleep, I love you
It's not easy tying knots, whose paycheck may get rained
Outstanding I shall smudge, invest, it's dull here, since we need I go beyond
Grey, lonely, this forest is very very different
Friend hail things like magnets all the way meant was (It only takes one slacker)
Traveling up, it only takes one slacker

[Aesop Rock]
It only takes one slacker, to attack alacrity and compliance with time
With regulations poachers poaching just to jump the batteries
I'm juiced, noosed father, no dissed deduce
By the ambiance of motives and the modus operandi's
I'm supportive, sort of here to modify those monsters
Tried to side wind pleasure captains round my hip line
My sit times on some here I lay my bricks alone to build these walls among
Us dreams can spread our spores but can I run with the alumnus fungus
After date rape, and it germs, and I burn for less fortunate starlight
Chasers forced to use there last match to ward off the glaciers
Pack a day profess cloud spitter, literate pacifist missed the pissed drunk of concert
Dull and system missed the funk I'm in a lull

[Dose One] (*Overlaps Aesop Rock's lines*)
I'm thinking of a number from one to red, is a beautiful color
To shade paper hat ink, I'm thinking of a beautiful color...
Paper hat

[Aesop Rock]
I'm thinking of a number
From one to home, one ridiculous tenement with no wings to spread
I'm home again inside my box of cardboard daze, I'm thinking of home
And I'm home again...

[Aesop Rock] + (Dose One)
(Funny how, faces show up, waters for me, my mouth and snore)
It could've been me but it wasn't
The crash and burn and burn and crash infected could collect fee indirectly but it doesn't
(These are broken cards given
To dues missed of friendly lips tied life is going blank, slap look
It's mirrored universe and one god per so many square feet, and
Everything counts, higher life forms are dirty, dirty Aesop, every penny
Saved, is this the city of dreams?)
And I'm down to Earth
(I'm down to earth, road)
My zero hour snuffed doc, where the marked the day the mirth burns
The time allotted, knotted loops around the plotted, boycotted the wattages
Toys for the prodding of the rotting bottled hostage
One time down cloud me as the useless playtime string and think it smirked
Worthy well, your with me, from the icicle sweat to the self pity
Sickly thread bare slid back my needle point life willow
Man I purposely spun straw to gold to lace each last stitch perfectly
It must have been the dust, the dust, my god, the dust he clutched the
Dust, father to rust encrust the luck with which I touch togetherness...
(Toy, bird, in my teeth, empathy, dwell, in merciful spring, friend)[Verse - 1]
Get money, chicka chicka ching, chicka chicka ching
Look not in﻿ wallet nor purse but purse
Some kids I shouldn't even be going through this except it seems
The clueless have taken it upon their shrewdness or lack there of
To brewed some blind love for their oppressor/molester
With his blood green complexion yet according to my comprehension
Cold hard cash is devoid of any affection so with no
Heart no racial preference
It fucks us﻿ all up, the narrow shaft of our essence
While we buy pillows cold sweatin
Dreaming of the world liquidated, laying and infatuated
And been fornicated orifice sedated by its own promiscuous behavior
Then inseminated by paper thin savior
Which whispered swift and seductive promises of happiness and bliss
Only if youve ever spawned upon thine hips and I ask you this
How can any being of want resist, thus with minds and money clips all embellishing its need
Allowing the young seed to subsist placing the warm breast to its lips shameful how now the need shifts
As you gleefully submit to motherly lusts and﻿ passionate fits of a hormonal monetary imba lance
And with one good reflective glimpse its obvious youve been short changed
On half wits but your quite contrite frivolous bitch
Alas quicker than quick, bestower﻿ of birth sits perishable nurse made enslaved and whipped
Stuck disposing of this filthy la vas piss and shit
Desperately hoping with such acts of piousness, you could, one day could
Be coddled in the mists of its empty embrace your local US mint deemed grace

[Hook]

Paying a penny for your thoughts and selling that soul for nothing fucking vile gluttons (x2)

[Verse - 2]
Dirty little thing ain't it, for such a small scrap of parchment
Tainted, my hopes run dry, indelible dime
Im a 6.6.6.5, which is probably contrived of human hair
A pinch of despair in fetal pigs eyes
Still in Gods trust we're mesmerized and directly besides our
Once prized lives we stack time Georgian E top lives
Never the less as much as mans surprise always banking on pains
Always got evolution looking like small change
While our small brains have grown financially deranged with
Crisis common sense greedily exchanged for the cold copper con
Strange how desire devours the mind, shame on our want
And little kind, you get a bottle of liquor and time, until
Its all polished off, then we shine, selfishly sentimental or
Consequential, rushes unconscious impassioned plushest
Dreamed of precious metals and sluts with beckoning labium
And glistening breasts heaving in sultry sweats, smears the eagles
Crest thinked in hot sex upon their chest, so uninhibited
And addressed in mid climax you wake up lucid mess and firmly
Press that hard dick into the matress(t) sending it drift and pulpous ecstasy
Completely content to lay dormant, with those plushy mitts affectionately backed about one last red scent

[Hook]
Keep paying a penny for your thoughts and selling that soul for nothing, fucking vile gluttons (x3)

It's in the pockets not the soul weigh it, break out your scales of self, analyze, look at yourself, look at your eyes
Not your accounts and set worths its inner, enjoyThere is no paid born tribulation
Arduous enough true love laden
Vied to uncut for morsel of indignation
Are bound beyond touch, streaming logic or labor
Can't conduct, exquisite
Through the realms of feeling empathy and implicit
Think elementally
All is spoken or written, isn't it?
And once having been experimentally envisioned in
Animated person's glaring eye
You can't communicate, live or even codify
Without such inklings, laced, magnanimous to the sense
Go ahead and try
And be mistook by
Underhandedness of man to decree
Tense are exemplify the expansive gift
Called me, myself and I
Without a canvas, gentle devotion
And hence
Cerebellum medulla in emotion
Or get the heart and soul lingually interwoven
Hence, for the weak-seekers God says
'Mankind is chosen, to fully partake'
Notice, not every purpose supplied
Case, getting olden
For the medium or in expressive
And every transient fiber and shred
Of her or him
Friend, you may begin to awaken
At any point, in, when, or what if? Question
In short, show some respect for perfections
Last pack (enhancer?) left with humane connections
Then scribe out some soul with resurrected intention
Not accustomed to in these parts
Since perspective ascensions
Pass a little dark for the bottom-dwelling populace farce convention
And the clandestine are
Essence disciples, lesson the passive trifle
Totally typical tidal temperaments
Affliction of the vital
Your testaments of life
Cycle through the excrements internally
Or get your wits about you, earnestly
Curving your weight, inadvertently
On one leg, unscathed index finger
Realizing enlightenment
Treads earthlessly in retroactive security
Of whats destined, reflect assuredly
The clearing from which you compose is under protection
Of the mercifully arose through correction
Personally potent, peripheral visionary
So rest in, our radical endorphin vortex
And be among the mystics of cerebral cortex
Where we're all adored, suns and droplets
Of a greater head-rush
Welcome, intact eligible flux
Of emotion, spirit and mind thus
All infinite cells are intertwined
About the crux of unconditional blind creative trust

Left:
Trust, remain the unparalleled
Permits persisting to jump
From a severe brainstorm's got stung
Step back, scale, insight stain struck
As wonders clap pale the span of soul-lit skies
Setting tight feelings, wail humans liberal cries
Til our own moment prevails
When a gap in the the lyrics never tries
And catch worse benchmarks
Why? It's not a moving piece of art
I couldn't invigorate a part in these incredibly potentially
Charged sinks over experience
Embarks on a vantage of initiative' over
These emotionally stark foreshadows grasp hold of bars
Than all of ballpoint may ever are
Craft and found and join into structures
Such a ma-magnificent use of the writing
If none stutter the buoyantly innocent
So easily amused, subconsciously contrast
My leveled inner views
Who seemed only to stew adrift with more further
And keener in tune sense of the yet-to-be channeled soon
Murmured, as healing echoes of two cents, while in shambles
Usurper commemorated annals of insecurity
Gorge fears, your (?) owes
Candles, to be mailed decrees
Tear, providing contemporary debris cleared
The skull slips willingly beneath the queer
More cataclysmic hush, as ideal embodiment steps for flush
Before cluttered mind to fantastically thrust life force
Upon bluish lines
Of course ultimately, brittle paper is touched
Transgressing all secular confines

Right:
Otherwise neutralities for the stillborn
And large rocks and ill-advised by incorporated ones
Who want not again and again
Invoke these acts, rehash, master plan
You couldn't remain in, digitally orchestrated
And then shoved down throats through suspect temples
So when time shines next, glaze on over
And indulge the once removed cousin of purchasing power
Run along, browse, to where putting neon solicits, impairing judgement
And I bet, crude names, the label reads
'Strychnine' while the cover says 'good for you too'
In the neatest font, slicker than that fraction snapshot
No, I beg of you, don't jump
Make the most of deja-vu
Before assuming a position that once extinct 50
Plus or minus umpteen senses been swapped
For the latest in compact... shit
Something should turn on, chime or dong
Your private parts are being touched, and forcibly at that
It's okay, feel violated, anything but entertained
Or bound and gagged, rather than financed
Mister impulse, and his rarefied wood-ship quartet
Be nice to your tape-deck, after all
Personal components don't have a power button
It's no secret, every culture has technical difficulties
And bad levels, be complacent, me? I'll stay critical
And oh yeah, before you go
Don't take any fiberglass navels

And the labors of the lyricist underlined
His strange fellows, squinted ears, if you think inclined
The given becomes a must
Until no one image, vibration or line could be too much
Or any energy origin deemed minds
Only us fuse, commune and combine
By changes cusp, therefore no-one's blameless
While our generation proceeds to burn on and aimless
I haven't the famous, what leads the disciple with experience famous
Or any more privileged for being so aimless
'But a power source is limitless,' heinous, molesters of the soul
Natural impotence remain in, which can sustain this day and age
Is mangy, frustrated, mane-less, prides of future shameless
Low blown ignoramus what's established my decrepit
Innocent stripper, You can't go against the grain
Whole persons would think quicker without your vanity clogging (?)
Be a stainless (?) is bigger, still it doesn't stop hither
As young women portray the whorey witch
High matriarch of slut-dom elects death bushes
Won't find fatal futility of guns are quite belligerently from
The not so distant land of insufficient funds and bastard sons
You're withering away at the hands of
Dogs and duns delighted to defoliate wherever some green may run
Then disperse to a slow trickle, offend and praising the sociopathic sickle
Over the very burning light
Which ripple your crumbling hides from dunes
Grossly disfigured nipples, so there you stand
Knowledgeably gleamed, and esteemed, poised to speak
In the orders, lime-lit green, atop a soapbox of the knees
Trusting screams, this time pause and wipe fortune slate clean
Before empowering slugs, do it to me
From those idolized lips, brother, things can always be better than this
Why not get a grip? Let the gaudy ode drip, and let the record skip
As you idle-ly hear enough to stitch
Showing them all how hip-hop exists independent of any
Poster, post or infanticide clip, love was what got us through
2 decades of "yes y'all" and it don't quit and if you feel need
Get back to it, by staking pain in what you hit
There's been enough, give me more a mind to eclipse
An eternity of altruistic shine all-round breakers with interest vested
Must have been re-aligned, your greatest strength will have only begun to climb
Forgive, thanks, peace, love
Maintain the forms bind, if I may be frank
Speaker and listener are two of a kind
While the mediums just tried out for better characters in line
What's content is ours to define
Within the clutch of ethereal downtime

There is no paid born tribulation
Arduous enough true love laden
Flied to uncut or morsel indignation
Are bound beyond touch, streaming logic or labor
Can't conduct, intact eligible flux
Of emotion, spirit and mind thus
All infinite cells are intertwined
About the crux of unconditional blind creative trust
If you think inclined, the given becomes a must
Until no one image, vibration or line could be too much
For any energy origin, these minds
Only us fuse, commune and combine by changes cusps
Speaker and listener are two of a kind
While the mediums just tried out for better characters in line
What's content is ours to define
Within the clutch of ethereal downtime..[Verse 1: Sole]
Well its 7:45 oh yeah
We'll see who's the bigger man
Other dead men walking 4:00p.m. I heard a dead man talking
He said its inconsequential
For get it its nice
I'll always get into harlots Ville with this knife getaway
I don't want to buy you a drink
Forget to piss on your pride little girl
Yeah stepped on your feet
You want to eat that dirty white how what ya looking at
The cap bartender tender me some sex on the beach
Before I reach out and impediment your speech
Once I get'em in my reach
Unprecedented impeach
He saw a double crossed dance illuminated by disco lights
Unseen unspoken
In a scene provoking a thought provoking scene
In a smoke scene interrupted by intervening disco lights
Ain't nobody dancing
Ain't no music everybody still
I can only see one man
He looks good enough to kill
So I muscle my way through dustless of imposers
10:30 to 10 feet away 5 fingers surround the object of entrapment
I don't need to see his eyes
I feel his jack then his shirt then his skin then his kidneys then out
Then blood then blood then blood
Then neck then blood then blood then blood chest
Then I see his girl watching over him
Like she is gonna cry his little ass back to life
This is my only way I know
So I must remove the knife
We eye to eye now
Goodbye to his life fool
I told you I would get my five dollars back tonight

[Verse 2: Slug]
Another night (night)
Another dollar (dollar)
Another crowd I enlisted to make holler (now scream)
Another I really wish this crowd was a little bit larger
Excuse me mister promoter
Could I bother you
For a couple of bottles
Of premium placed on the stage
For me and my brethren you know beverages
Intoxication balance and leverage
Guessing this is that point where I grab the mic and make my point
Kick my flow make'em say hoooo
Blow the lid off the joint
Ahem: blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
And then they befriended I love it when this situation happens
This the type of crowd that build self esteem
Come 10:30 is was I finally felt that sting..

(Commotion: Yo yo yo yo (hes got a knife)
Yo what the fucks going on right here
Calm the fuck down calm that shit down (that's blood)
Check check get'em up get off get off)

I shed another blood
You knew I would
I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever
Trapped death stepped up to
Shed another blood
You knew I would
I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever
Trapped death stepped up to

[Verse 3: Doseone]
Sorry, just alcohol
Thanks anyhow its just been one of those days alcohol only
How can you not sell fucking cigarettes at a bar excuse me
But I wonder where those two wild women are
I've gotten off one minute they're all ears and big eyes
Then they're wandering off
To bark up the next mans tree EXCUSE ME
Thank you Jesus Christ this place is
Now that's a foxy young lady
If only she would put some clothes on (excuse) enough
I’ll stay put and just vend in the meat market hummm hmmm hmmm
Who are these that shits pretty dope
But I can hardly hear his vocals and the bass is too loud
Actually this kid is nasty
To bad I can't hear the words (excuse me)
Damn like he couldn't have just walked pass oh and the stare too
See everybody want to show you
How big their and how little they think
I be if it
Is that the chick Jim was trying to get on she's alright
Man its hot as balls in here why did I wear this
(screaming) He's got a knife is that blood
Oh my God I've never been this
That's blood he's dying, gone

[Verse 4: Alias]
Uh uh oh my god twisting and turning
What's that sensation of burning
Yearning to witness some spoken words but now I'm learning
But I can't step into the outer limits of my abode without
Kids acting hard staring glaring
Yes I'm in the daring mode
My girl debated me going out at
This nocturnal time she said I should just chill
Stay in the house and write a rhyme
I disagreed and ventured out
Totally against all of her wishes
Stated that if I went to this particular venue
I would later be needing stitches
But my manhood
In the need to ease my mind has forced me out to check and see
What this up and coming lyricist is all about
Arrived at the show at 9:45 and they're saying these kids are live
Waited in line to pay my fee to take my entrance to this dive
Already performing up on stage
These kids outside smoke deuce
The rhymesayer had the crowd by the balls while up in the dj booth
Final manipulation is complex in the body of its sound
Mesmerized in higher elevated on the shoulder I feel a pound
My right side and his right side
Connected accidental
He's staring in my vision
And taking Said something about knocking out dentals
Then tried it on slowly
I paid no attention to his words
Cuz pursuing any challenge by forth at this point would be absurd
I saw no familiar face in the sea of goatees and baseball caps
Which is fine with me
Cuz this ocean is filled with mindless saps
Just then I heard a scream behind me
There was quite a commotion
I felt something tap my back once
Then repeated in this motions
Oh my god twisting and turning
What's this sensation of burning
Yearning to just witness some spoken word but now I'm learning
I should have listen to my girl when she spoke up and debated
If I had then my body and soul would not be separated (oh my god)

This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing and random
Princess raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...)

And it goes a little something like this..

[Aesop Rock]
Moon walking a broken soul pedigree incessant
Gut the cruddy frame
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
Cutthroats the result of pulp jokes soaked in poacher constants
And not a jewel amidst coal wander prominent.. honor (honor)
I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
Sew your first martyr stitch
Join damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage

[Dose One]
So you mean these things are worth money
Now drifting off
This is the who-you-calling-homeless
Mock me fearful
Twisted mighty fearful twisted and tonight I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert
And you're in it, icabod

Running out of morals for my allegory... (moseying)
My kind of people will sell only circles. (woseying)
With my eyes patched in a not so new universe
So I beckon and bray but my pretty bird just ain't muting the many...

[Aesop Rock]
Oh it'll be soon (real soon)
Balloon immune to doom blend
I ain't ditchin' the kitchen 'til every spoon bends
A glance along tomorrow, sorry
Looking lot of hopefuls was the rain dance
My little flint never dreamed would flutter potable
See I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
Contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place (incoming)
Hmm, You want to be a Czar?, idolize fallen heroics
Recognize root of the worship, search and hold it
Who put the fun in dysfunctional?
I, prodigal son combustible, donkey-punching pinholes
In uncomfortable Zen conjunctionals for good (good)
The bear cub slop a goblet of dirt wine
I nurse a single application of introvert, serpentine

[Dose One]
Now a sunset without a scrape of red an-an-and a plastic bag noise
Sunk down around his head sick-sick-sick-sick...
Stealing a peak
There's sickness the roofer's eyes and his alone
And nothing terrible happened to the bag

Wrongs spilled off in...
And brought on out the clouds...
The hiss cuts out...
Spill its voice...
And the piano...
And the window full of...
Star is fresh... kept
From where I'm going... holy other
Holy other, holy other, holy other...

[Aesop Rock]
B-B-B-B-B-But
I've got charcoals in my heart, I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
I've got charcoals in my heart, but I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart

And before, when I said 'Shut the fuck up, it's none of your business'
That was to be in vein
Be sure to lock that up when you're all finished
Finished yet? Now uhm...
I usually finish this number with uh... my skull open

[Aesop Rock]
Everybody rally around the novel burners, spit, murder the matches
Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions
Then the masses wanna lean on me like "oh captain, my captain"
Not considering maybe this orphan hosts morbid attachments...

Button, button, who's got the button
Take my name, please...
Button, button, who's got the button

Oh, you like to help with coats wait unti you see what I got in this here locket

[Aesop Rock and Dose One]
This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
And I can't forget the not-so-perfect bow around the middle
Har-bour (???)[Doseone]
Empty
Things
She's calling
She's calling me tonight
From just inside my lips
And
I'll write her
Betterment of the world through wish
Wish I'd
Fall off, growing distant
I'll write her
And pull my face fresh
From the waxy palms it's kept soft in

[Why?]
There's something
To the fading of faith
My whole childhood
Was the broken guitar
And my sister's silly
Yellow blanket
Now I carry
Slender and sexy curved
Sledge hammers
To break the bricks
I bought
I should have never went to college
But took a trip to Costa Rica
To cut rainforests
To choke myself

[Doseone]
Making up Miss Bobafetet as I go along

[Why?]
And rejecting the truths that I've been served

[Doseone]
Fool in
Besides
Tuition for my countenance
Pressed fine in reverse block
Style print
A product
Of cave drawings
Gone automated
With these loafers and a check book
Twisted tightly into... into
I know
A stiletto

[Doseone and why?]
Do you know how many times
I've thought about writing about the paper I'm writing on?

[Why?]
I lost my liquid tongue for the wet pen

[Doseone]
I have one mortal wish

[Why?]
I don't even know where i've been
(in the basement, hugging the gas main.)
Something's been left out of this game
God, did you remember to render everything?
I've seen 1078 sundays and
7 borders where the liquid meets land
I've even seen stars
Now where the fuck
Is anti-emptiness?

[Dose one]
I'm leaking into stoned and severed existence

[Why?]
I've been consumed by my own breath

[Illogic]
Change of face, shapeless
Personality switch, transformation
So impersonation of self leads
Crowds in twos to disintegration
Who's in the basement choking a puppet on the pedestal?
Let a stool pigeon escort those who contort
Three doors down into the left door on the right hand side
My hand slides into pockets
Pull sockets of lead penalty

Orbs of red energy
Entering the orbit of the morbid
Northern and southern hemispheres of play caps
Place time bombs and rose stems on your axle
Clear case
Hole in faded ozone layer of doom
Sphere of babylon shield
Towering above gravity
Taking up space in a residence of stars

[Dose one]
A touching story of ungrateful velcro skulled boy
With his tored-off face
And the life-sized sacked marionette
He'd thought looked an awful lot like him
(with his time told and mildewed
Baby clothes of a business man.)
Jerk... wackoff slumped
And he's tired, sick with bad posturing
One can't hold in
Oh hell, there's a king of jungle in him yet
Give our young lad middle of america's valise
But spare the gauze, he's losing poet by the gallon
Glory, Glory
Bottom of the quicksand's gonna give him a
Whole lot less to think about
Than change that steel trap perspective would
Perhaps

I ain't a scared no more, to make a' the difference
Stolen heart, and a whole wide world to blame

[Why?]
I've been
Living
In a record
Skipped filmstrip

I'm falling off the side of the boat
And when I hit water
I'm falling off the side of the boat
I fall asleep hoping
Tomorrow tastes like poems and honeysuckle
I move slow cause the sky looks bluer
When you fuck the order of the day
Or the way the shelves were meant to fit
I wish I had a pair of stilts to wear
While I play the flute in some
Light-traffic hallway in my old high school

But these are only threats to the seated self
Maybe Spain is the open-faced smile
From some life I saw in a movie
And always thought i'd live

[Doseone]
Jackpot!

[Illogic]
Congratulations!

[Why?]
Space is potent

 [Aesop Rock and Dose One]
This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing and random
Princess raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...)

And it goes a little something like this..

[Aesop Rock]
Moon walking a broken soul pedigree incessant
Gut the cruddy frame
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
Cutthroats the result of pulp jokes soaked in poacher constants
And not a jewel amidst coal wander prominent.. honor (honor)
I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
Sew your first martyr stitch
Join damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage

[Dose One]
So you mean these things are worth money
Now drifting off
This is the who-you-calling-homeless
Mock me fearful
Twisted mighty fearful twisted and tonight I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert
And you're in it, icabod

Running out of morals for my allegory... (moseying)
My kind of people will sell only circles. (woseying)
With my eyes patched in a not so new universe
So I beckon and bray but my pretty bird just ain't muting the many...

[Aesop Rock]
Oh it'll be soon (real soon)
Balloon immune to doom blend
I ain't ditchin' the kitchen 'til every spoon bends
A glance along tomorrow, sorry
Looking lot of hopefuls was the rain dance
My little flint never dreamed would flutter potable
See I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
Contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place (incoming)
Hmm, You want to be a Czar?, idolize fallen heroics
Recognize root of the worship, search and hold it
Who put the fun in dysfunctional?
I, prodigal son combustible, donkey-punching pinholes
In uncomfortable Zen conjunctionals for good (good)
The bear cub slop a goblet of dirt wine
I nurse a single application of introvert, serpentine

[Dose One]
Now a sunset without a scrape of red an-an-and a plastic bag noise
Sunk down around his head sick-sick-sick-sick...
Stealing a peak
There's sickness the roofer's eyes and his alone
And nothing terrible happened to the bag

Wrongs spilled off in...
And brought on out the clouds...
The hiss cuts out...
Spill its voice...
And the piano...
And the window full of...
Star is fresh... kept
From where I'm going... holy other
Holy other, holy other, holy other...

[Aesop Rock]
B-B-B-B-B-But
I've got charcoals in my heart, I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
I've got charcoals in my heart, but I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart

[Dose One]
And before, when I said 'Shut the fuck up, it's none of your business'
That was to be in vein
Be sure to lock that up when you're all finished
Finished yet? Now uhm...
I usually finish this number with uh... my skull open

[Aesop Rock]
Everybody rally around the novel burners, spit, murder the matches
Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions
Then the masses wanna lean on me like "oh captain, my captain"
Not considering maybe this orphan hosts morbid attachments...

Button, button, who's got the button

Har-bour (???)[slug]
Who's lost and who's the boss?
How'd his head get chewed off?
Open your mouth, spit it out
Move ain't enough for tryin' to lift the crowd
I missed the bus but i caught the flight
Mischievous and it cost my life
Atop the bridge, count the cars below
Wishing time would slow so i could stop to go
Leaning to the sides and making the turn again
I'm learning the turns and i'm familiar with the terms
Tryin' to shed light with the songs i write
But the lights require fire now i'm covered with burns
Seventh degree, put my flesh in the heat
Too much adrenaline for just lettin' it be
Sometimes i wish that they would leave me dead in the streets
But i feel like half a human when i'm restin' my feet

[Dose]
I don't know, that huge thing sure is a long ways off

[Alias]
And my strength is quickly reducing

[Dose]
What if by chance we got lost?

[Alias]
That's a good point, that has also passed through my head

[Dose]
Big belly river, ocean wide, that it is a lot bigger than me
Ooooh, i shudder at the thought

And i'm painfully aware of opinions playing a big role
Wishing i could release myself from this depressing strangle hold

Hiding almost out of breath on the other side of the lights
Fingering our belly buttons
Dreaming of the bigger things in life

Hiding out of breath on the other side of the lights
It's fingering out belly buttons
Thinking of the bigger things in life!

[alias]
How god awful does this sound have to be
For me to gain a large core audience?
Plainly change is in the air
But when the spotlight is swung in my direction will anybody care?
Constantly this train runs through my head, daydreaming
My connection to it all is supported by poles
Thank god last year i invested in the spring board
It made the most important thing in one of my best friend's life
It's exactly one orbit later
And the pangs of being unsure haunt my every waking day
Am i being selfish for creating myself and friends first
And the others second? i wouldn't change it for the world
Yet i feel stuck between a rock and a three thousand mile trip
That kept getting pushed back causing more of this discussion
The art of confidence is not one of my strongest areas
And probably never will be, probably never will be

[slug]
Wishful thinking at an all-time high
Kiss the demons and make 'em all cry
Standin' at the window watchin' the wind
Countin' the tears that get caught in my grin
Chewin' on the center of interest investin'
All the time and the pride that rests upon my chest
Continue gathering twigs to build my nest
Self-battlin', eatin' up epiphanies for breakfast
I went to all the parties, i met all the women
And i've stood at the center of the prism, to the left of attention
And to the right of the universe
As bad as it is, i gotta believe that it could be worse
Walkin' through the rain and the millennium
Where lazy and convenient is the mother of invention
I must have the guts to mention to the man in the reflection
Yo, what you lookin at? (what are you lookin' at?)

[dose]
Ooooh there's some climbing going on
Adam's found his courage, adam's found his courage
Open, put on display puddle perfect, open again
The happy one's a poison pen leaking all over me, all over in order
I'm rolling at this movie of a poet's wife
Staring at my belly button, thinking of the bigger things in life
Hiding almost out of breath on the other side of the lights
Little things in life, it's quiet[Verse 1: Sole]
Well its 7:45 oh yeah
We'll see who's the bigger man
Other dead men walking 4:00p.m. I heard a dead man talking
He said its inconsequential
For get it its nice
I'll always get into harlots Ville with this knife getaway
I don't want to buy you a drink
Forget to piss on your pride little girl
Yeah stepped on your feet
You want to eat that dirty white how what ya looking at
The cap bartender tender me some sex on the beach
Before I reach out and impediment your speech
Once I get'em in my reach
Unprecedented impeach
He saw a double crossed dance illuminated by disco lights
Unseen unspoken
In a scene provoking a thought provoking scene
In a smoke scene interrupted by intervening disco lights
Ain't nobody dancing
Ain't no music everybody still
I can only see one man
He looks good enough to kill
So I muscle my way through dustless of imposers
10:30 to 10 feet away 5 fingers surround the object of entrapment
I don't need to see his eyes
I feel his jack then his shirt then his skin then his kidneys then out
Then blood then blood then blood
Then neck then blood then blood then blood chest
Then I see his girl watching over him
Like she is gonna cry his little ass back to life
This is my only way I know
So I must remove the knife
We eye to eye now
Goodbye to his life fool
I told you I would get my five dollars back tonight

[Verse 2: Slug]
Another night (night)
Another dollar (dollar)
Another crowd I enlisted to make holler (now scream)
Another I really wish this crowd was a little bit larger
Excuse me mister promoter
Could I bother you
For a couple of bottles
Of premium placed on the stage
For me and my brethren you know beverages
Intoxication balance and leverage
Guessing this is that point where I grab the mic and make my point
Kick my flow make'em say hoooo
Blow the lid off the joint
Ahem: blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
And then they befriended I love it when this situation happens
This the type of crowd that build self esteem
Come 10:30 is was I finally felt that sting..

(Commotion: Yo yo yo yo (hes got a knife)
Yo what the fucks going on right here
Calm the fuck down calm that shit down (that's blood)
Check check get'em up get off get off)

I shed another blood
You knew I would
I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever
Trapped death stepped up to
Shed another blood
You knew I would
I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever
Trapped death stepped up to

[Verse 3: Doseone]
Sorry, just alcohol
Thanks anyhow its just been one of those days alcohol only
How can you not sell fucking cigarettes at a bar excuse me
But I wonder where those two wild women are
I've gotten off one minute they're all ears and big eyes
Then they're wandering off
To bark up the next mans tree EXCUSE ME
Thank you Jesus Christ this place is
Now that's a foxy young lady
If only she would put some clothes on (excuse) enough
I’ll stay put and just vend in the meat market hummm hmmm hmmm
Who are these that shits pretty dope
But I can hardly hear his vocals and the bass is too loud
Actually this kid is nasty
To bad I can't hear the words (excuse me)
Damn like he couldn't have just walked pass oh and the stare too
See everybody want to show you
How big their and how little they think
I be if it
Is that the chick Jim was trying to get on she's alright
Man its hot as balls in here why did I wear this
(screaming) He's got a knife is that blood
Oh my God I've never been this
That's blood he's dying, gone

[Verse 4: Alias]
Uh uh oh my god twisting and turning
What's that sensation of burning
Yearning to witness some spoken words but now I'm learning
But I can't step into the outer limits of my abode without
Kids acting hard staring glaring
Yes I'm in the daring mode
My girl debated me going out at
This nocturnal time she said I should just chill
Stay in the house and write a rhyme
I disagreed and ventured out
Totally against all of her wishes
Stated that if I went to this particular venue
I would later be needing stitches
But my manhood
In the need to ease my mind has forced me out to check and see
What this up and coming lyricist is all about
Arrived at the show at 9:45 and they're saying these kids are live
Waited in line to pay my fee to take my entrance to this dive
Already performing up on stage
These kids outside smoke deuce
The rhymesayer had the crowd by the balls while up in the dj booth
Final manipulation is complex in the body of its sound
Mesmerized in higher elevated on the shoulder I feel a pound
My right side and his right side
Connected accidental
He's staring in my vision
And taking Said something about knocking out dentals
Then tried it on slowly
I paid no attention to his words
Cuz pursuing any challenge by forth at this point would be absurd
I saw no familiar face in the sea of goatees and baseball caps
Which is fine with me
Cuz this ocean is filled with mindless saps
Just then I heard a scream behind me
There was quite a commotion
I felt something tap my back once
Then repeated in this motions
Oh my god twisting and turning
What's this sensation of burning
Yearning to just witness some spoken word but now I'm learning
I should have listen to my girl when she spoke up and debated
If I had then my body and soul would not be separated (oh my god)

I shed another blood
You knew I would
I feel you should
Adapt
Can't run forever
Trapped death stepped up to
Shed another blood
You knew I would
I feel you should
Adapt
Can't run forever
Trapped death stepped up to

(Well or, and this is, New York City)
Where the shiftiest sources leak out the back door
For more and this is New York City
(Oh, I see these hear walk
I, simply a shade of shepherd
Seems we share fate, honestly)
Oh, now wait a minute
I notice there making mockeries of mad men
Tend not to bend in the honesty
My twenty thousand leagues ending grants sardonic fatigue
(The view from this here segue crowds a listeners nothing special simply
Listeners, how we dissolve its spores and I'll tell you not flying)
And I live beneath the scenic yeah, where the fossils pledged allegiance
Where the centipedes and serpents bigot on territorial disagreements
The uprooted turned moody and hacked pleasure to skinny ribbons and I'll
Suckle my skull caught beneath assumptions pumping pistons
(Left the joke to wick, it
He walks whose out now, we, Aesop walls up)
We tune out the pouts of hiding
Twilight street merchants, we, deity freely and been here before...

Murder, of holy, in cushion
Partisan, part of the ceiling seems to be leaking, oh, oh, it's the wall
Forbid box been broken, from man of everywhere, that's what I sleep, I love you
It's not easy tying knots, whose paycheck may get rained
Outstanding I shall smudge, invest, it's dull here, since we need I go beyond
Grey, lonely, this forest is very very different
Friend hail things like magnets all the way meant was (It only takes one slacker)
Traveling up, it only takes one slacker

[Aesop Rock]
It only takes one slacker, to attack alacrity and compliance with time
With regulations poachers poaching just to jump the batteries
I'm juiced, noosed father, no dissed deduce
By the ambiance of motives and the modus operandi's
I'm supportive, sort of here to modify those monsters
Tried to side wind pleasure captains round my hip line
My sit times on some here I lay my bricks alone to build these walls among
Us dreams can spread our spores but can I run with the alumnus fungus
After date rape, and it germs, and I burn for less fortunate starlight
Chasers forced to use there last match to ward off the glaciers
Pack a day profess cloud spitter, literate pacifist missed the pissed drunk of concert
Dull and system missed the funk I'm in a lull

[Dose One] (*Overlaps Aesop Rock's lines*)
I'm thinking of a number from one to red, is a beautiful color
To shade paper hat ink, I'm thinking of a beautiful color...
Paper hat

[Aesop Rock]
I'm thinking of a number
From one to home, one ridiculous tenement with no wings to spread
I'm home again inside my box of cardboard daze, I'm thinking of home
And I'm home again...

(Funny how, faces show up, waters for me, my mouth and snore)
It could've been me but it wasn't
The crash and burn and burn and crash infected could collect fee indirectly but it doesn't
(These are broken cards given
To dues missed of friendly lips tied life is going blank, slap look
It's mirrored universe and one god per so many square feet, and
Everything counts, higher life forms are dirty, dirty Aesop, every penny
Saved, is this the city of dreams?)
And I'm down to Earth
(I'm down to earth, road)
My zero hour snuffed doc, where the marked the day the mirth burns
The time allotted, knotted loops around the plotted, boycotted the wattages
Toys for the prodding of the rotting bottled hostage
One time down cloud me as the useless playtime string and think it smirked
Worthy well, your with me, from the icicle sweat to the self pity
Sickly thread bare slid back my needle point life willow
Man I purposely spun straw to gold to lace each last stitch perfectly
It must have been the dust, the dust, my god, the dust he clutched the
Dust, father to rust encrust the luck with which I touch togetherness...
(Toy, bird, in my teeth, empathy, dwell, in merciful spring, friend)[Verse 1]
Hush child, don't make me affix hatred
Your coordinates into my lingual matrix
And shape this microphone into a dominatrix
Whipping you shameless
Emcees be all tongue and anus
Needless to say, brainless
So take a deep breath and think gracious
Before I scar all your faces
Leavin' that flavored ass tasteless
Still, you boast about cheese lost in the rap races
Fabricatin' first places, champ?
You can't even tie them shoe laces
Rookie, get back to basics
Take ten nostalgic paces
Bow your head and get wasted
As the mere echo of my phrases
Replaces what used to be your mental mazes
Then again, the proceeding statement raises
Much room for debate
Since your labyrinth was a cubical with an open door
In terms of this metaphor
Of course, you poor fallen meteor
Off course, intended to plummet evermore
Throughout the cosmos
Except your path brought you dangerously close
To the burnin' master pro they call Dose
Representin' the shores of my conception- coast
Ahhh...squire, to your ignorance we toast
And drink away such pain
My bad, was that your jugular vain?
It's funny, awww, blood stain
You're quite tame
Eyes have lost that pretty flame
Pretty shame and remorse make my palms sweat and voice slightly hoarse
But it's all in sport, or was it the mind?
That there was an introduction to a battle rhyme

[Verse 2]
Come on and let's get down the logistics
As I lay law from the iller district
Leavin' the cock strong dickless
Beings exotically twisted
Like Mayan tapestry-cryptic mic mastery is depicted
As I get down right statistic, humbling the gifted
Emcees can't even get down
Talkin' about “I get lifted”
Then why ain't you elevatin'
I guess all that masturbation has got you grippin' the mic tight awaitin' some form of sterile sonic ejaculation
Pitiful exhibitionist
I pity you over impotence and relative insignificance
Reminisce in other...
Peace officer
Deceased coffin saw
Other ceremony your master
You should've been a pastor
You can still live a lie
And only greet truth when you die
But you're just high
Well I am surrounded by chickens and snakes in a pigsty
Still, jokers like you wanna battle the white guy
Can't you see soul burnin' in my eye?
For in that eye your prime sacrifice material
Lost in hope of a miracle
But rap most cope with bacterial infections such as thou
Watch where you point that scowl
Were you born the ugly child?
See, I was born phonetically restless
Already able to kinetically impress this silhouette into your breast with spontaneous focus conception
Burnin' flesh with my tempered inflection
Properly certified for stage cross sections
Splittin' all around me, wide open
Leavin' carbon monoxide in the air smokin'
Put it this way- if it breathes it's fuckin' chokin'
On the words I set in motion
Sky splits and thunderclaps
The One has spoken
I battle gods at The Vatican, Parthenon, or Hoboken
Still, your slogan is
"Nah man, I'm not about that Thought Provokin'"
Yes it's true, you're just broken-backed
Harder than English
But this man slaughtered the fiendish
Since the infinite deemed this dark apostle seamless
Among the tattered and dreamless masses of demons
So pray he come like semen
And get lost in my abstract womb
Extracting whom you be through those actions
As you fall to the will of my faction
Thanks, it's been fun practicin'
I'm done taxin'[Verse 1: Yoni Wolf]
As I lay me down to fall asleep
With my demons dying
And my pilot light weak
I curse the last six months
I've been hiding behind a mustache
Yeah
And to those last 10 years
I've been howling a paper moon
Well fuck you

This goes out to all my underdone
Other-tongued
Lung-long frontmen

You shine a flashlight in
A hat box and spin
An empty oyster shell
And celebrate the hollows

This goes out to dirty-dancing, cursing
Back-masking, back-slidden pastor's kids

And all us earth growths

[Verse 3: Yoni Wolf]
In Berlin I saw two men fuck
In the dark corner of a basketball court
Just a slight jingle
Of pocket change pulsing
In the tourist park I lost 50 euros
To a guy with the walnut shells
And the marble
It really pissed me off
So I thought I'd go back
To get my money
But all my homies warned me
"Oh no, those gypsies
Prolly got knives"

[Hook 3]
This goes out to all my under-brewed
Double-duped, two-time truth-fools
(Stop thinking a phone call
Or text is too complicated [DOSEONE])
And all us earth growths
Some planted
(Like a married uncle at a family function [DOSEONE])
And some pulled

[Bridge: Yoni Wolf]
I got them shaky gums and a couple of loose tooths
Now tell me what should I do?
My God, the clock's always
Stuck tellin' 11:11, at 3:32

Could beat the pants off your best man [DOSEONE])

In a crowded room projected debonair
Aloof impermanence
He shrouded loosely
In a heavy air of indeterminance[Verse - 1]
Get money, chicka chicka ching, chicka chicka ching
Look not in﻿ wallet nor purse but purse
Some kids I shouldn't even be going through this except it seems
The clueless have taken it upon their shrewdness or lack there of
To brewed some blind love for their oppressor/molester
With his blood green complexion yet according to my comprehension
Cold hard cash is devoid of any affection so with no
Heart no racial preference
It fucks us﻿ all up, the narrow shaft of our essence
While we buy pillows cold sweatin
Dreaming of the world liquidated, laying and infatuated
And been fornicated orifice sedated by its own promiscuous behavior
Then inseminated by paper thin savior
Which whispered swift and seductive promises of happiness and bliss
Only if youve ever spawned upon thine hips and I ask you this
How can any being of want resist, thus with minds and money clips all embellishing its need
Allowing the young seed to subsist placing the warm breast to its lips shameful how now the need shifts
As you gleefully submit to motherly lusts and﻿ passionate fits of a hormonal monetary imba lance
And with one good reflective glimpse its obvious youve been short changed
On half wits but your quite contrite frivolous bitch
Alas quicker than quick, bestower﻿ of birth sits perishable nurse made enslaved and whipped
Stuck disposing of this filthy la vas piss and shit
Desperately hoping with such acts of piousness, you could, one day could
Be coddled in the mists of its empty embrace your local US mint deemed grace

Dirty little thing ain't it, for such a small scrap of parchment

A pinch of despair in fetal pigs eyes
Still in Gods trust we're mesmerized and directly besides our

Never the less as much as mans surprise always banking on pains
Always got evolution looking like small change
While our small brains have grown financially deranged with
Crisis common sense greedily exchanged for the cold copper con
Strange how desire devours the mind, shame on our want
And little kind, you get a bottle of liquor and time, until
Its all polished off, then we shine, selfishly sentimental or
Consequential, rushes unconscious impassioned plushest
Dreamed of precious metals and sluts with beckoning labium
And glistening breasts heaving in sultry sweats, smears the eagles
Crest thinked in hot sex upon their chest, so uninhibited
And addressed in mid climax you wake up lucid mess and firmly
Press that hard dick into the matress(t) sending it drift and pulpous ecstasy
Completely content to lay dormant, with those plushy mitts affectionately backed about one last red scent

[Hook]
Keep paying a penny for your thoughts and selling that soul for nothing, fucking vile gluttons (x3)

It's in the pockets not the soul weigh it, break out your scales of self, analyze, look at yourself, look at your eyes
Not your accounts and set worths its inner, enjoyThe only dance I know is debt…

Do you know
All the words To tomorrow
Do you know
Every last paragraph to how I feel…
Lets say I don’t lie to you
But, do you lie to you…
I’d keep anything you give me
Stab wound even I’d be careful
With a key carved from any part of you…

You can dance your head at death
You can dance down your monument to death
You can dance dance dance miss
You can widdle down your monument
To a thimble and sip milk from it…

Gimme an N
Gimme an O
Gimme an A
Gimme an N
Gimme an G
Gimme an E
Gimme an L
What are you then…

A name in Nagasaki on a bad day…
You can't control the frozen no fucking way
They say, you can't betroth the frozen…
No way…

Even if I give her a vital organ in a jewelry box
With the truth on top…

You can dance your head at death
You can dance down your monument to death
You can dance dance dance miss
You can widdle down your monument
To a thimble and sip milk from it…

And then injured boyfriends everywhere…
You are no loss to the angel ranks
No tear in the space time continuum
No poison not drank
No cap stone slave driven up a pyramid’s planks…The pedestrian:
Neither a protest song nor an endorsement
Generation of dead beats we headspin on the tombstone of ginsberg
Enduring the banality of a sober burroughs for so long
As sole pours out a bottle of evian for the disembodied and gin for hemmingway
We without impetus born through a trap door into this history
The universe shrinks and our conception of it doesn't fit anymore
An electric candle burns bedside in a remorseful elegy for elanor rigby
And her middle-aged daughters
A wedding gypsy band bangs out a domestic lament on antique ukulele
And petrified elk bones
A flower on a guitar withers wantonly hippie anthems
Entangled within broken strings and baez tunes
Reliving those moments otherwise left alone
Throughout these gutted crates and creative gutters
Woodstock burns as we windmill on the wasteland of eliot
My windblown voiceprint on the ruins and verandahs
Around imitation roman columns at the outpost of mediocre
Where mid-level administration is making it the romanticized slacker
In all threadbare elegance questioning the eternal amid echoes like tendrils
Might i be the only one here in the roll call of minor set backs and major failures?
A dim yes faint no and a resonating maybe saluting the first flag visible
Through the settling dust in the setting dusk embroidering my uniform of deathless song
I whistle woman with the curviest of drums would be libertine
But my wounds are literate so i make slut of it all
With a skewed perspective and scurrilous adjectives
It's like lysergic acid verses venomous incantations
Over influenced of our tongues
Look at me growl mouthful of venison and perennial yawn
When i wake up i may find it all gone
My cheaply inked innocence is indeed wearing thin
And being holed up in a motel with a case of whiskey
And a typewriter is not a vision quest

Dose one:
Oh and actors of slightest idea left stuffing in lockers
To make their walk home short and nightmares the kind of crap
Their kids couldn't eat off tv with hook hands and poked holes for eyeballs
Nowhere to go by but the canary
It's minimum wage in all out war or hide
And work played to the wheeze of a dead beat in autumn
Of no man is island and everything has already been done once

The pedestrian:
Somebody get me a hero and i'll author a tragedy
Yet murder in the theatre on an idle afternoon where duchamp
And death meet and don't create but do play chess in the park
Until the curators and clerics recede to their quarters
Heritics in the paradise of fitzgerald
And in the alleys of 'frisco
Our recurrent tourist can only begin to think
Picturesque of more distantly postcard
Once a cipher rat, now i'm looking for a publisher of dead beatitudes
And parables as absurd as the world we've woven for ourselves
Out of worn down wonderment and wormwood
Rewriting the masterpieces word by word
Listen carefully, this song's an empty shell on the shore of the worthless ones
My stab at simplifying beyond the hybrid of a smiling sambo and stony buster keaton
Phantoms in black face dance provocatively
Around bundles of fanon's psycho colonial tomes
Oh it's as obvious as i get without hollering "fuck my father"
In double time freebasing placebos in a corporate experiment
I've seen some of our most brilliant minds
Corrupted by boredom and booze like sixtoo howls
But psyche shit stained and incoherent
I'm a cycle myself still chasing the aesthetic
With a hellhound on my trail and a rent bill in his mouth
Maybe i'll just make a living out of question marks
It's the recovering junkie poet slash alcoholic novelist part of us all
Any number of crossroads for yonder children of divorce and bankruptcy court
Hardly a great depression. we're all spoiled and mildy neurotic
By day this middle finger is a white flag
Signifying our apathetic middle-class course
Look at me roar, jaw jammed with raw flesh and perennial yawn
When i wake up, i may find it all gone
Wondering if the glass just half is in an empty world
By now dylan's harmonica's museum bound soundtrack
To a bank commercial they'll bury you in the suburbs
With car keys and cell phones warmed over death in prefab dream homes and bingo on sundays
They'll forget you in the ghetto banging on your chest
To hear the gold rattle in your gums
This pointlessness pulses through my dearth of faith
Pointless in an imperfect circle without center
Each of us hypocrite preachers without flocks
Every generation is lost and makes songs out of it
But ours exiled from the searchOne: Emotion, the mental abacus of natural effect
Notice what happens when I place this tennis ball
Atop this little ramp i've got here

Two: The abacus and the hair
The abacus is dusty attic bound and leaning on the playroom wall
Beside it lies one hair; human's, kitten's, not the issue
Both were useful. *notice the emphasis on "were" there

Three: Dead man's knowhow, a fund's transfer
Chrysalis prime, diploma customer
The incubation period of circumstance gone
Emotion in a bottle, rephrase'o'matic

Two men on adjacent, yet so totally out of sight deserted islands
Wage a war of castaway irony
Floating battled cries for the h-word back and forth...
Absolutely no concept. oh look, a battle

Dust pan pick a color, any color
Dead man's teal, a coroner

The modern organism, retronym, a tent with holes in it
Poison puppy, see through dreams...[Dose One]
Sincerely, as always
(Hi new friend! Nice to meetcha!
Oh sure! I'll check out the dinner arrangements..)
We do it for a reason
Understand it all, take your time

I got a friend, a true leader amongst men
If I ever met one, hows about a hardy listenin
Or even some, passive/attentive inspire
You to write later feedback, it's no
Walk in the park to write about things you think and see
Or or is it that, a two-way coil
When once in a while there's bogs like, you to bump into
On a walk in the park

It ain't easy.. (so, give it up and I'm let down
It's an univited sitdown)
But it well.. (somethin feels, how do people place
In things that make one turn twelve)
And often study.. (self-expression
And it goes a little somethin like this)

The evolution of an organism is it self-fulfilling
For a mind to settle DDN adjusters on bi slabs
And do the destructive creative changes
One before we even have the (?) to put a finger on
It's where exactly space is folding for us
So hand, gradually opportunity comes to this
You searched erotic costs a lot of sand
Time, seconds yes, a body out of water yes
A lot of, divining moments, yes
I knows you all, why do you ask?
We not in, the big, poetry class
In fact.. we found broken round together..
So there..There is no paid born tribulation
Arduous enough true love laden
Vied to uncut for morsel of indignation
Are bound beyond touch, streaming logic or labor
Can't conduct, exquisite
Through the realms of feeling empathy and implicit
Think elementally
All is spoken or written, isn't it?
And once having been experimentally envisioned in
Animated person's glaring eye
You can't communicate, live or even codify
Without such inklings, laced, magnanimous to the sense
Go ahead and try
And be mistook by
Underhandedness of man to decree
Tense are exemplify the expansive gift
Called me, myself and I
Without a canvas, gentle devotion
And hence
Cerebellum medulla in emotion
Or get the heart and soul lingually interwoven
Hence, for the weak-seekers God says
'Mankind is chosen, to fully partake'
Notice, not every purpose supplied
Case, getting olden
For the medium or in expressive
And every transient fiber and shred
Of her or him
Friend, you may begin to awaken
At any point, in, when, or what if? Question
In short, show some respect for perfections
Last pack (enhancer?) left with humane connections
Then scribe out some soul with resurrected intention
Not accustomed to in these parts
Since perspective ascensions
Pass a little dark for the bottom-dwelling populace farce convention
And the clandestine are
Essence disciples, lesson the passive trifle
Totally typical tidal temperaments
Affliction of the vital
Your testaments of life
Cycle through the excrements internally
Or get your wits about you, earnestly
Curving your weight, inadvertently
On one leg, unscathed index finger
Realizing enlightenment
Treads earthlessly in retroactive security
Of whats destined, reflect assuredly
The clearing from which you compose is under protection
Of the mercifully arose through correction
Personally potent, peripheral visionary
So rest in, our radical endorphin vortex
And be among the mystics of cerebral cortex
Where we're all adored, suns and droplets
Of a greater head-rush
Welcome, intact eligible flux
Of emotion, spirit and mind thus
All infinite cells are intertwined
About the crux of unconditional blind creative trust

Left:
Trust, remain the unparalleled
Permits persisting to jump
From a severe brainstorm's got stung
Step back, scale, insight stain struck
As wonders clap pale the span of soul-lit skies
Setting tight feelings, wail humans liberal cries
Til our own moment prevails
When a gap in the the lyrics never tries
And catch worse benchmarks
Why? It's not a moving piece of art
I couldn't invigorate a part in these incredibly potentially
Charged sinks over experience
Embarks on a vantage of initiative' over
These emotionally stark foreshadows grasp hold of bars
Than all of ballpoint may ever are
Craft and found and join into structures
Such a ma-magnificent use of the writing
If none stutter the buoyantly innocent
So easily amused, subconsciously contrast
My leveled inner views
Who seemed only to stew adrift with more further
And keener in tune sense of the yet-to-be channeled soon
Murmured, as healing echoes of two cents, while in shambles
Usurper commemorated annals of insecurity
Gorge fears, your (?) owes
Candles, to be mailed decrees
Tear, providing contemporary debris cleared
The skull slips willingly beneath the queer
More cataclysmic hush, as ideal embodiment steps for flush
Before cluttered mind to fantastically thrust life force
Upon bluish lines
Of course ultimately, brittle paper is touched
Transgressing all secular confines

Right:
Otherwise neutralities for the stillborn
And large rocks and ill-advised by incorporated ones
Who want not again and again
Invoke these acts, rehash, master plan
You couldn't remain in, digitally orchestrated
And then shoved down throats through suspect temples
So when time shines next, glaze on over
And indulge the once removed cousin of purchasing power
Run along, browse, to where putting neon solicits, impairing judgement
And I bet, crude names, the label reads
'Strychnine' while the cover says 'good for you too'
In the neatest font, slicker than that fraction snapshot
No, I beg of you, don't jump
Make the most of deja-vu
Before assuming a position that once extinct 50
Plus or minus umpteen senses been swapped
For the latest in compact... shit
Something should turn on, chime or dong
Your private parts are being touched, and forcibly at that
It's okay, feel violated, anything but entertained
Or bound and gagged, rather than financed
Mister impulse, and his rarefied wood-ship quartet
Be nice to your tape-deck, after all
Personal components don't have a power button
It's no secret, every culture has technical difficulties
And bad levels, be complacent, me? I'll stay critical
And oh yeah, before you go
Don't take any fiberglass navels

And the labors of the lyricist underlined
His strange fellows, squinted ears, if you think inclined
The given becomes a must
Until no one image, vibration or line could be too much
Or any energy origin deemed minds
Only us fuse, commune and combine
By changes cusp, therefore no-one's blameless
While our generation proceeds to burn on and aimless
I haven't the famous, what leads the disciple with experience famous
Or any more privileged for being so aimless
'But a power source is limitless,' heinous, molesters of the soul
Natural impotence remain in, which can sustain this day and age
Is mangy, frustrated, mane-less, prides of future shameless
Low blown ignoramus what's established my decrepit
Innocent stripper, You can't go against the grain
Whole persons would think quicker without your vanity clogging (?)
Be a stainless (?) is bigger, still it doesn't stop hither
As young women portray the whorey witch
High matriarch of slut-dom elects death bushes
Won't find fatal futility of guns are quite belligerently from
The not so distant land of insufficient funds and bastard sons
You're withering away at the hands of
Dogs and duns delighted to defoliate wherever some green may run
Then disperse to a slow trickle, offend and praising the sociopathic sickle
Over the very burning light
Which ripple your crumbling hides from dunes
Grossly disfigured nipples, so there you stand
Knowledgeably gleamed, and esteemed, poised to speak
In the orders, lime-lit green, atop a soapbox of the knees
Trusting screams, this time pause and wipe fortune slate clean
Before empowering slugs, do it to me
From those idolized lips, brother, things can always be better than this
Why not get a grip? Let the gaudy ode drip, and let the record skip
As you idle-ly hear enough to stitch
Showing them all how hip-hop exists independent of any
Poster, post or infanticide clip, love was what got us through
2 decades of "yes y'all" and it don't quit and if you feel need
Get back to it, by staking pain in what you hit
There's been enough, give me more a mind to eclipse
An eternity of altruistic shine all-round breakers with interest vested
Must have been re-aligned, your greatest strength will have only begun to climb
Forgive, thanks, peace, love
Maintain the forms bind, if I may be frank
Speaker and listener are two of a kind
While the mediums just tried out for better characters in line
What's content is ours to define
Within the clutch of ethereal downtime

There is no paid born tribulation
Arduous enough true love laden
Flied to uncut or morsel indignation
Are bound beyond touch, streaming logic or labor
Can't conduct, intact eligible flux
Of emotion, spirit and mind thus
All infinite cells are intertwined
About the crux of unconditional blind creative trust
If you think inclined, the given becomes a must
Until no one image, vibration or line could be too much
For any energy origin, these minds
Only us fuse, commune and combine by changes cusps
Speaker and listener are two of a kind
While the mediums just tried out for better characters in line
What's content is ours to define
Within the clutch of ethereal downtime..Keep trying
To dig the sun it’s grave
While I grow
The goals of a slave
These machines and simpler pimps don’t need you
Won’t haunt you
And just might eat you
Like any girl, shrink, shark, art, dark, heart, marked start will do..
To you, and whom…ever you choose…
I wanna fall, till I forget on a field of blooming knives
And I de-scar, and fall till I forget what baseball cards are…
Who’s your inspiration, a girl or just another god, or dead philosopher
What you got
You got a she you can keep…
No… but I am believed…
Keep trying to dig the sun its grave
With a shovel or substance
To light up the coal that you love with
Or do I only describe my own numbness…
Keep trying to dig the sun its grave
With your ice
Your ice all over me
And This chest full of ice
Is so not tight[Verse 1]
Throwing pennies on the pedestal
Where heads once rolled…
Are you with wish
Or paying for every execution
You have ever missed
In that former life…

[Chorus]
In that former life…
Were you the committed type
Never missed a hanging
In that former life…
Were you the committed type
Never missed a hanging
Humanity tangling in you enjoying your angering

[Verse 2]
Some children simply keep the taste
It could be the removal of a grandfather from his place
In photographs
A pet slew by the length of a vacation
Either way…

[Verse 3]
It’s laughter cut
With fear and doubt
From here on here, and here all out…
By, by, by the way
As it’s language staircase’s creek
Across all birthday’s do eat…
By, by, by the way

[Chorus][Intro: Pedestrian]
There's a little Johnny Walker Lindh in every Meadow Creek Middle School
And when the rap tape grows up
Each wave topples at first wind before the self settles in the body

[Hook: Dose & Why?]
The names of prominent families
Carry no weight in foreign cities
And even the sons of senators
Receive no welcome outside the States
The names of prominent families
Carry no weight in foreign cities
And even the sons of senators
Receive no welcome outside the States

[Verse 1: Dose]
We hold these truths to be self-evident
Once a-fucking-gain we got a dollar model president
Carving his face up for the cover of the next new nickel
Combing every cotton coil of his inner white wig
Curling perfect sers to his own thin lips in the mirror
Working on his Contrapposto for stone
Oh yeah whitey, you got empire guilt

[Bridge: Why? & Dose]
We know John Walker, we know John Booth
Waste our days swatting this single song
At a long line of Yale and bones born old men
We know John Walker, we know John Booth
Waste our days swatting this single song
At a long line of Yale and bones born old men

[Verse 2: Alias]
While the widows buy rubber grips to open bottles with
It's dreams with dusty dashboards and chipping paint
At least the animals have something to poison themselves with
Director yelling "Cut!" on riot footage in the background is faint
And at dusk the clanking of fork to plates syncs
Man of the house drowning out the chatter of housewife
To yet another unmanned spyplane crash
Now televangelists have a basis for book sales
And the promise of effective prayers that get results
As well as God's insurance policy for guaranteed divinity
Time to give the fallout shelters a makeover
Grab a pen and pad of paper and Ikea catalogue today

[Verse 2: Sole]
No matter what plastic you pray to or sponsorship you kill for
Become a smart happy healthy pet rock if you can eat like us
You'll make great soup and hot new imports for domesticated devils
Don't worry, in thirty years we'll all be Johns and Sarahs

[Hook: Dose & Why?]
But the names of prominent families
Carry no weight in foreign cities
And even the sons of senators receive no welcome outside the States
The names of prominent families
Carry no weight in foreign cities
And even the sons of senators receive no welcome outside the States

[Interlude: Why?]
A flag stripes trying to tear free in heavy wind
And separate themselves from any unified composition
Oh, I heard the two parties split platforms at the turn of the century
But I know I'm American by the coins I carry
And that's fucking scary
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
And even the worn wigged hard news anchors are unaffected
And every psychic and small-time prophet is aloof
We've been injected to the point of immunity
It takes an f load of s to stimulate the
Desensitized tastebuds of the sugar-expecting community
Till we can barely detect the weather man's insincerity
Their tongues are fast and free
Like a child's translucent un-braced teeth
A low relief long horn
On a roughneck's rawhide wallet
(Can I hear that, ah, last tongues are fast, you know)

[Dose]
Yeah America, you got it

[Verse 3: Passage]
The audio haunting promise provides for even the smallest of sparrows
So long as the ghosts are clean and clearly showing through you
I've been helpful, metal man bides his time
In the sands on Minus Island
Everything is fine, your heart is working properly
All my love and luck on the river Euphrates

[Verse 3: Passage & Sole]
Don't take no wooden nickels, kid
There's bikinis selling SUV's in the TV's in teepees
Time to look for Job, the dorks have hit the desert
The carbohydrate kings are back with fanny packs
And daisy-cutters strapping parachutes to Lunchables
To land on the lap of the new batch of bargain hunters
Now we're not saying anything cause we're not supposed to
But like Blockbuster hamster gave the Black Panthers cancer
I know what you're thinking, it's like drinking the ocean
But if you can fall in love in prison you can die a healthy plant

[Outro: Dose]
He wanted Hammer pants, he joined the Taliban
He sought an absolute truth, the alpha cliché
But he got the omega and bucked
How many more humans will wear gun spit in their guts
Why, you can still smile on the cover of Life magazine
No matter how many bullets you take
Again we use the magnets poorly
Again we use the magnets poorly
Again we use the magnets poorly
Again we use the magnets like shit
What is it with all these men in their fifties
Wanting to win the world over like there's no tomorrow already?

No matter what you do, G.W
There'll be no dollar for you
Woe is the billionaire
Woe is the billionaire
No matter what you do, G.W
There'll be no dollar for you
Woe is the billionaire
Give him a bomb to suck on[Verse 1: Doseone]

And when I
Slept
You'd knead
Glue into my wings
Tie rocks across my eyes
[?And stop forth from crossing?]
And I
When I pretend to mourn your death
I'm honestly probably solemnly
Nostalgic
I could explain all sorts of love but this ain't no licking toad
I could explain all sorts of love but this ain't no licking toad
I keep trying
To finish writing (This line)
About women hiding [(?)]
(Jump)
You want to complain but your
(numb)
I ain't no settler
Not a girl in her
Twenties
Knows what the fuck she requires
I ain't no settler
Nay not met
A girl in her
Twenties
Who knows what she wants
I could explain all sorts of love but this ain't no licking toad
I could explain all sorts of love but this ain't no licking toad
[?]
I can tie the stem of a rose with my tounge
And the rows of my teeth
And woe that i reap
[?]
Its my pattern
I give it up
I give it up
I give it up
I give it up
Its my pattern
(reapeted)[Sole, Dose-One, Alias]
We ain't fessin' this friendship
All live crews turn to dust
We're from the middle of nowhere
Da dadu dade deda
If you want to high post, I'll watch you fall of a pedestal
We feel safe on the soapbox
Da dede de dede du
It's the return of the demo, and you can't dub us over
We're being ourselves, why the secret decoder?
We ain't fessin', hell read it
Ain't a one trick intention
Keep your guilt to yourself
Da dede du denden
It's as danceable and positive tip as it is a movement and dark
Signing is so relative
I mean, why even sign art?

[Dose-One]
I ain't business man hollow
I ain't happy man meat
I see the sky as a socket
I can't sleep, I don't eat
There's a bird in my throat
And a ghost in my place, so I wail
I am to the truth as the truth is to coincidence
Imagine holding onto one quarter for the rest of your life
So I broke, thunder words beside a cork set
Holy smokes! English class was vomit
Why it's hip hop music let me get the chills
Where my good people at?
I need a cat sitter
And don't give up on the song write, cause
Lethal ain't fessin'

[Alias]
With the tintinnabulation heard above every third word
Through sealed lashes I grasp at straws
Who's the victor?
I ask the mannequins with the detachable hands
Hidden from their reach to pass the dutchie on the left hand side
Currently residing in opposite currents
Making for an interesting commute
I do the kick step
In an attempt to reacquaint myself with what I thought
I was in love with
Plus to boot I'd like to return to excitement
Of one strap down with my reflection in my shoes
And the practiced frown that carried over and cursed me
With being unapproachable
Why you jelling?
You know why...

[Sole]
How am I?
I'm good
But the real good stuff don't make it to page
I applied for Howard Hughes but live off less than minimum wage
How are they?
The same as last time I saw them
Waiting for Nintendo games to turn to money trees
And all that's cool to no shows
And we turned everything around and gave them "Kick me" signs
Cause mine is too short to get direction from college grads
Who can't change car tires
Is it me or is everything in here boring to death
And wants you to date it?
Only interesting long enough to make you hate it
I've spend the last ten years drawing curtains to hide behind
And I'll be damned if they give my job
To some snot nosed MC look alike
Who matches his hundred dollar shoes with a hundred dollar shirt
Straight from the sole, I ain't fessin'...

[Sole, Alias, Dose]
Two and a half since we met
We'll be rich in six months (repeated)
No friends
No choice
No friends no choice no deal (2x)
All of this for next to nothing
