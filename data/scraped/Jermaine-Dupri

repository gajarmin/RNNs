[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I- love you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change ya
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Hook]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feeling ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Oh oh oh oh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been eleven days, um-teen hours
I'mma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

[Hook]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gonna learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn)
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (oh)
I'm twisted cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)

[Breakdown]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
Ooh ooh oh (can ya hear me burnin'?)
Ooh ooh ooh oh ooh oh

So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return

["Dominic Cattano" from American Gangster (film)]
"Your success took a shot at you
What are you going to do now?
How are you gonna kill it?
You're gonna become unsuccessful?
Frank, you can be successful and have enemies uh?
Be unsuccessful too, and even have friends"

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
I got these niggas breezy, don't worry about it
Let that bitch breathe
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a Premie but I'm not and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with with
Shit, let that bitch breathe
I'm way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portion is like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight I'll off your on switch
You're not too bright, goodnight long kiss
Bye bye my reply... BLAH, BLAH
Blast burner then pass burner to Ty-Ty
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
Now where was I?
Let that bitch breathe
I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more
Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss poor
I'm pissed off, and is this what success is all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spades I drink just to piss out
I mean I like the taste could've saved myself 6 thou's
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu
Hold up, lemme move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG tell these boys
(Ya'll ain't got shit on my nigga)
I got watches I ain't seen in months
Apartment at the Trump; I only slept in once
Niggas said Hova was over, such dummies
Even If I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Ya'll ain't got nothing for me
Nas: let that bitch breathe

[Verse 2 - Nas]
Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance
Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven, I climax from paper
Then ask why is life worth living?
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck walk inside the lions den
Take everybody's chips, about to cash them in
Up your catalog dog, mine's worth too much
Like Mike Jacks ATV pub, Mottola can't touch
Let this bitch breathe

[Jay-Z & Nas]
Let this bitch breatheWatch this...

[Hook:]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I dont know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said "one second baby please hear me"

[Hook]

[Breakdown]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

[Hook][Usher Intro:]
There's always that one person
That will always have your heart
You never see it coming
Cause you're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me
It's clear for everyone to see
Ooh baby ooh you'll always be my boo

Do you remember girl
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
Cause I remember girl
I was the one who said put your lips like this
Even before all the fame and
People screaming your name
Girl I was there when you were my baby

[Hook: (Usher)]
It started when we were younger
You were mine my boo
Now another brother's taken over
But its still in your eyes my boo
Even though we used to argue it's alright
I know we haven't seen each other
In awhile but you will always be my boo

[Hook: Alicia]
I was in love with you when we were younger
You were mine my boo
And I see it from time to time
I still feel like my boo
And I can see it no matter
How I try to hide my boo
Even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

[Alicia Verse 2:]
Yes I remember boy
Cause after we kissed
I could only think about your lips
Yes I remember boy
The moment I knew you were the one
I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
I was there and you were my baby

[Hook:]

[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I told ya'll niggas long time ago
Come fuck with my city, nah mean?
Rich Homies, Migos, Young Thug, and me motherfucker
Yo, yo, yo, you know what I'm saying?
When you get off that motherfucking plane

[Hook: Quavo, (Rich Homie Quan) & (Young Thug)]
(Welcome to Atlanta baby) You never been to Atlanta?
Welcome to new Atlanta, Phantoms on top of Phantoms
(Get at new Atlanta baby) Hannah Montana boot up in Atlanta
New Atlanta, we don't need security, walking around with that hammer
Bring out the cameras (ca-camera babe)
(Porno movie, fuck your camera baby)
(Don't get your bitch ass killed in new Atlanta baby)
(We don't fuck with cameras out here, I'm for real)
(Fuck the police we won't tell, we keeping it trill)
(In new Atlanta baby)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Crossover spaghetti junction
Northside Migo bando bunkin'
Lil' momma she foreign, she not from this country
Fly to Atlanta, we land in the morning
Droppin' my top on the avenue!
Young nigga, you stay with your mama, call you Bartholomew
Come to Atlanta, we breakin' the rules
Do you remember my teachers said we wouldn't make it
I gotta thank y'all, Atlanta made us famous
Across the world, we in Venezuela
We live in Atlanta, might have some haters
The new Atlanta like the old Lakers

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I'm a young rich nigga, whippin' up chemicals
Middle of the summer wearin' chinchillas
Up through the city Atlanta with your bitch
She poppin' that pussy, no pimple
It's been a long time coming, Migos, Thug, Rich Homie
No we don't fuck with no phonies
You niggas be cloning, they watching like Sony (you copy me)
Momma said I was a born star
Came out the pussy with a spatula
Selling dope like Pablo Escobar
I'm hot, they lookin' for me switchin' cars
Bentley Mulsanne I just blew out the brain
Of the Audi R8 with the paper temp plate
Takeoff and Thug, Offset, Quavo, Quan
New Atlanta, we the heavyweight

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Offset]
I had the desire, we startin' empires
You niggas retired, Givenchy attire
I'm trappin', they think that I live in The Wire
I had to flood out my new Audemars
Drop in the Ghost, scaring niggas like Michael Myers
Fuckin' your bitch, pass her out like a flyer
All the lil' kids lookin' at me admiring
I pull up in 'Raris, I Forgi my tires
I'm dropping a four in my Tropicana
This the New Atlanta, pullin' up in Phantoms
For you niggas that monkey, we got bananas
Throw a temper tantrum when I'm on the channel
We finessin' that kind up in Atlanta
Put a price on your head like a bandana (there go 12!)
Dipset, like Juelz Santana
I'm dropping the top on my panoramic

[Hook:]

[Interlude: Jermaine Dupri]
Motherfuckers hatin' and shit
Motherfuckers still moving out here and shit
It's still love in this motherfucker
And niggas think this shit gon' stop
It ain't never gon' stop, it's just gon' keep going
Rich Homie, tell 'em where you're from

[Verse 4: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A, GA that where I'm from
East Atlanta, that where I stay, aka the slums (east Atlanta)
I got, I got trained to slime without a gun
Migos and Quan roll up another one
Doctors don't know what we on
Mansion still poppin' on Mondays, ain't no more 20 grams
New Atlanta, we stuntin', I keep me like 20 bands
Shawty Lo lifestyle, I’m the man, got your main ho head in my hand
I ain't Future but I'm having free bands, I can't help who I am
Tell 'em Quan
I can't help who I'm is or where I'm from
Welcome to Atlanta, where you better watch your tongue
Hey, I did dirt for this water, I feel like a pond
I'm from Bleveland, Rich Homie Quan, tell 'em where you from

[Hook:]Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold

[J.D.]
Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is... So So Def

[Nelly]
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 more at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cause when I...

[Brandy]
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)

[Nelly]
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

[Hook]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
I want to see your grill (You wanna see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom rows gold)

[Paul Wall]
What it do baby, it's the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

[Hook]

[Gipp]
Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

[Ali]
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em, on the top, on the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

[Gipp]
I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

[Ali]
I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold)

[Hook]

[Brandy]
Boy, how you get grill that way
And how much did you pay
Every time I see you
Tha first thing I'm gon' say hey.....

[Hook]Uh uh
So So Def
Yeah, yeah

Chorus: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z

[Jermaine Dupri]
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
[Jay-Z]
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang
[Jermaine Dupri]
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't glean clean
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang
[Jay-Z]
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

[Jermaine Dupri]
Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

[Jay-Z]
I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' ho
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

Chorus

[Jermaine Dupri]
My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm "The Truth" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why? Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

Chorus

[Jay-Z]
Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxing
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

Chorus

[Jermaine Dupri]
So So Def, Roc-A-Fella, collabo'
You know, all we do is..

Rock, rock on (*repeat to fade*)[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Question; What y'all know about swangers on slab
30's on a Hummer with the butterfly doors
Lucky Charm teeth, lack on them D's
Chevy sitting high, iced out everythang
Stacks on deck, no bank
What y'all know about five of the hottest young niggas in the game
Bow Wow, Short Dawg, Scrappy
The boy Lil' Wayne, the homie Pimp C
We got a little story to tell y'all bout where we come from

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I come from where a Chevy with a trunk full of bump is all that's wanted
And the year don't matter long as you throw some, throw some Ds on it
Mouth cost more than your house, house on ten acres
And the inside so fly niggas call me Jim Baker
From Ohio to Texas, we're so infectious
A-T-L to S-T-L it's gon' be hard to catch us
I'm talking bout bills sipping on bar
Drinking crunk, living like there's no tomorrow
See out-of-towners can't understand, cause I cut all my words short
Popping Texas, mandatory, Saturday at the mall
Hoods ain't hoods, they called wars and zones
Guns cart choppers and when it's on, it's on
See the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, hear me out
Said the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, now answer me this

[Hook x4: Pimp C]
Unh, now what y'all know about the country boys
Coming down with candy toys, playing hard talking noise

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
The boy country like overalls you know that dawg
Catch me in the slab, the same color as Bubu's rust
Cruising up the Ave and I'm probably gon give yo' ho a call
Cuz I ball hard and I'm stuntin' like there's no tomorrow
So yesterday, I swear I spent about fifty G's
On a wristwatch that shine brighter that a Christmas tree
If you was getting cheese, you would probably spend it, too
So don't hate me cause I blow paper like the wind do
And hop out clean, so watch out, Queen
I'm the biggest balla in Houston homie, not Yao Ming
I'm getting money maine, so my pockets hella chubby
And I be sipping drank that's purple like a Teletubby
So when it comes to the women dog, I can tell they love me
They put they panties in a envelope an mail 'em to me
Now how's that for some fanmail
But me an Bow got a question, know the answer, raise your hand, yea

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Lil' Scrappy]
They call me Fisher Price cause all I do is play nice
And I ain't gon run a gang of gorillas that love to fight
I'm the Iceman, I'm far away from the sun
But I'm still hot like a bullet pushing up out a gun
My charger look like a muscle lifting a ton
If you picking on me, yea you picked the right one
You passed another drink and I'm sipping another one
You trust me with the blunt and I'm blowing myself a blunt
Got a Fruit Loop Coupe looking like orange juice
When them niggas see the troop, they don't be knowing what to do
Yea I'm Scrap, greatest young nigga in the nation
Y'all niggas quit hating on the money that I'm making
I'm just country

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Look they call me Wayne, dirty south chaperone
So far ahead in the race, I don't know which lap I'm on
No homo, Young Louisiana
Hit you wit the .357 like MC Hammer
And money talks, so that's my grammar
If you ain't about money, you can step like a gamma
Am I the illest doing this? Hell yeah
I am fresher than the Prince of Bel-Air
And OG kush I what you smell here
Smoking the biggest blunts, don't worry I brought a spare
They say I'm at the top, but I'm almost there
And when I get, I will sit, don't worry I brought a chair
I put ice all over the Audemar
Piguet watchface, now time is hard to tell
And I will do whatever The Carter shall
So hot, going out with me is like going to hell

[Refrain][Hook] [Jermaine Dupri]
Ayyo a Pimps a Pimp
Flow is flow
Doe is do
Ho's a ho
Chic's a chic
Trick's a trick
Bitch a bitch across the world
So, nigga, getcha money and attend to your girl

[Cam'ron]
Now when it comes to these hoes I did'em I got'em
Rip'em and rock'em
But if I hit'em I pop'em
But if I lick'em I lock'em
And I ain't famous at all
Let my game tell it all
But they a pain in my balls
Got to train'em like dogs
From how they, walk and they talk and when they sit on the couch
To how they, lick in they mouth and never shit in the house
But I make ladies wit babies, let the street drive em crazy
They say "Cam, good you saved me" Now I pimp em and they pay me
They feelin' it like Jay-Z, on Sugar Hill like AZ
Went _Party Time_ like Tray Lee, I'm SoSoDef like J.D
Oh baby they have you stressed, nigga
Mad depressed
I want they mind...Muthafucka, you could have the rest
Cause I gas'em up, I tell them I'm more than just the lover
I want to be your friend, father, confidant and brother
See my, nine-inch slugger now she, chose her devotion
With messing with my money, girl you messing with my emotion

Chorus x 1

Now baby-cakes what's you're name?
(Ain't no need to explain)
Why is that?
(Cause I'm from Down South)
Well I got Down South game
And to mess wit' you this my last attempt
Cause I only like when you're ass is bent
So damn dumb you ain't stash a cent
You ain't know I get cash to pimp
Go ask him, my whores are fresh
Hardcore to death, 'xplore the rest
Tell you now backdoor's the best
For the stress
We never raw in flesh
Why I'm sores aguess (?)
I get paper, yeah I stack them chips
Condoms when I grab them hips
Kiss and mix you wrap them lips
And if she act (smack the bitch)
If she wack (smack the bitch)
Sad to see the way it had to be
Mack the bitch the bitch don't mack me
Cubic snappy but so are mine, know my rhymes
Yo, my rhymes got a concubine
Cause I control they mind
Avoid the crew
'void the groove
Got more doe, than the fued
Got more hoes, than the few
If I die they wouldn't know what to do
Whatcha think all they do is cry?
Tell you this between you and I
Forty slit wrists outta the forty nine suicide

Chorus x 1

And now I'm drunk of the Henny now, went off the Remi now
Niggas always envy now cause I'm good and plenty now
And when it come to gettin' head, yo many bow
Girls acting friendly now (Killa cum up in me OWW)
I leave em past leaking
Last weekend, I took Cardan to get his ass eaten
He said you past freakin but I'mma ace so throw your cards up
But if you stink baby, I ain't hard up
Hard luck to wash up, but that's insulting, revolting
But if you clean we ballin, eat you til you catch convulsions
And girls all fiend, for the bodm on my team and my mob
Think we scheme and we rob the way they screamin' for God
And all sluts wit the V's, let em see how it be
They be like "No, you ain't puttin all that meat up in me"
You whylin out, for the styinout
Girls say I'm foul and doubt
But baby got to understand
That's what my style's bout

Chorus x 2

Ayyo a Pimp's a pimp[Hook: T-Pain (Fabolous) {J.D.}]
I try to play cool
Actin like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin at home, all alone
Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't) {y'all know what this is}

[Fabolous]
Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to key my house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

[Hook: T-Pain (Fabolous) {unlisted J.D. ad libs}]

[Fabolous]
Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

[Hook]

[Fabolous]
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up
We already straight - yesss

[Hook]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Fab we gon' have to make a dance to this song man!
Y'knahmean; ain't no WAY you can't dance on this
Uhhh, T-Pain!

[T-Pain]
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~![Nate Dogg]
Chiti-chiti-bang-bang

Rollin wit'cha nigga Nate D
You know these niggas straight bang
Big game D - ballin with the 21st street
Chiti-chiti-bang-bang
Don Chi Chi (That's me)
Still makin tight-ass beats
I'm rollin in my brome, I stay sweet
Ain't nobody ballin like me

[Jermaine Dupri]
It goes, mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the biggest baller of all
I got a 700, a Bentley, and a Magine
The girls just DIE when I'm ridin past
Live life like I'm sellin pies
Ah-rabian, with two or three wives
Two or three houses to hide
Ten cars that's parked outside
And they all got bodies that's wide, follow me
As the Leer jet flies, over Crimson Tides
Four bedroom duplex in the sky
Nicknamed Lottery, cuz I don't stop spendin
When the wheels stop, the chrome keep spinnin
Like the six moon-walkin, shit I ain't talkin
I'm straight livin it, it's a wonder I ain't shiverin
I'm so frozen and you've been chosen
To roll with me and Nate D-O double G, sing

[Nate Dogg]
It's five o'clock in the mo'nin
I've already downed five, I've already downed five Mo's
See ya around my block on the weekend
All we do is chase bad, all we do is chase bad hoes
Pass me the weed if it's chronic
If not then I just say no, then I just say no
Three girls a date, that's my limit
We ballin outta control, we ballin outta control-ol

[Jermaine Dupri]
Now whether you like me or not, whenever I drop
You know I give you number one hits platinum hot
It's so much clarity in my rocks, I'm thinkin like
It's gotta be somebody greater, maybe it's not
Cuz I flow for those, that get that dough
Hits for every chick with a size C tits
See it's like this, I don't mind wavin at you kids
But I can't manage to raise my wrist
Jewels so heavy, y'all fools ain't ready
My twenty-two shot the streets into confetti
Move like Andretti, redlinin
Whatever city I'm in, headlinin
At five a.m. I'm still lookin for mo'
Still gettin crunk, still lettin it flow
Bar outta Cris' now I'm drinkin Mo'
Stomach upset, I feel like I'm about to let it go

[Nate Dogg]
It's five o'clock in the mo'nin
Got my pedal to the flo', got my pedal to the flo'
It's time I test my 600
Wonder how fast this bitch go, wonder how fast this bitch go
Three girls and two of 'em sleepin
One got her hands on my balls, one got her hands on my balls
Sun's comin up, we still drinkin
We ballin outta control, really ballin outta control-ol

[Jermaine Dupri]
Dance, everybody
And everbody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
Everybody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
And everybody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
Everybody just clap ya hands

Still makin tight-ass beats
I'm rollin in my brome, I stay sweet
Ain't nobody ballin like me...[Hook: Fundisha - repeat 4X]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

[Lil' Bow Wow]
Yeah, now basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
I keep it so fresh on the microphone
I like no interruptions when the game is on
I like slam dunk, to take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll
I like the give-and-go
In this basketball, Bow Wow, let's go

[Hook]

[Lil' Bow Wow]
I got the rock in my hands
Ain't no telling what I'm gonna do with it
When I come position I'mma act a fool with it
I might cross you up fake one way
Turn around and hit you with you with the MJ fadeaway
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

[Fabolous]
Don't too many players get offers like me
Back and forth, I'll likely
Shake the checks off your Nikes
They almost had me in a suit at the draft
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go glass too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They dont know if I'mma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look
See my game consist of a whole lotta
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters
J.D. gon lead us to a ring
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders wanna sing

[Hook]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Now tell me were you in the joint
The night MJ scored 63 points
When the Lakers won titles back to back
Didn't give nobody, no kind of slack
When Vince Carter came and stuck his arm in the rim
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall
Playing D with desire, it's basketball

[Hook] - repeat until fade[Produced By: Jermaine Dupri & Manuel Seal]

[Intro: Jay-Z]
I mean, Ush, is this what it comes to man?
This how we gon' do it?
I mean even grass grow baby, you know?
Seeds become plant, boys become men
What we gon' do? Let's lead the way

[Jay-Z]
Uh, wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
What's my demeanor? The grass is always greener
On the other side, there's bigger lies, can't give a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck, how coould I give a finger?
Let alone half bath and closets
So claustrophobic, in fear of close objects
Now it's sorta like two door garages
It's like two broads menagin, you the best mama

[Usher]
Is there any chance
That you remember me being more than just a horrible man?
And would you consider
Pulling this trigger and taking a second shot at romance?
Aw baby, I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't till now I see how much I missed you
Girl, I'm sorry I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once here goes the truth
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing

[Hook]
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And you're all I feel in strength
Cause baby when you left, you took the very best

[Usher]
Remember Mimi or Vita? Remember Iesha or Eva, I ain't got 'em no more
Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, the same outcome as Chilli, girl, I let 'em all go
Oooh, no more trickin and kissin miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you; how much I missed you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once it goes that's true
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
Uh, momma try to told me "Hovi Hov to slow it down
You gon' lose the your thing if you keep gettin round"
Like pop need a partner when you ol' to hold him down
Ma, forever young was forever numb
Sorry Staci, sorry Dawn, Amil-lion and all of them
All of them was for the time, it wasn't you, it was him
School me once, school me twice, three times I was dumb
Now it's so plain to see to me I got the one, you the best mama

[Usher]
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing

[Hook]"It's not - It's not me exactly, who touches people
It's what I represent, the possibility that dreams long ago
May still come true, even if they - even-even-even if they look lost forever"

[Bow Wow]
I had a homey named Tony, sixteen, six two
Headed to the NBA straight from high school
My nigga had his ball game on lock
But at the same time, he was in love with the block
All the stuff that came wit it, the drugs and the guns
The gangs, the slang and all the funds
He just got a letter of contempt from the Cavaliers
Sayin' how they love him and they wish he was there
He had +it made+ like +Special Ed+, about to get the bread
But chose, to do, sumthin' dumb instead
Go to war with the crew on the other side of town
And was mo' ready, and Tony got laid down
He ain't even have a chance
Died before the ambulance, even got to him
So many went through him
I hate to tell the story, but that's how it is
Growin' up in the hood as a kid

[Hook]
When you got big dreams, don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the wayside ("even-even if they look lost forever")
When you got big dreams
Don't listen to what nobody say and don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the waste side, reach for the sky ("even-even if they look lost forever")

I knew this girl named Gina that was a hell of a singer
And everybody fell in love with her when they seen her
Baby girl was on the verge of signing a big deal
Eighteen, and life looked so-so real
She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
And all he ever did was give baby the blues
But she was true to a nigga, do for a nigga
Pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga
One night he came, picked her up told her, "let's ride!"
That's the same night that he watched her die!
They was tryna hit a lick, but the lick hit back
Put a end to the deal, and all of that
She ain't even have to be there, he know it wha'nt right
Now he gotta deal with it for the rest of his life
And the part I don't like, he ain't even get graze
But homegirl, Gina, is layin' in the grave

[Hook]

I got a few relatives given family drama
Always got they hands out when they see me and my momma
One coulda been a doctor, the other a chef
But when he got his own kitchen, he was cookin' sumthin' else
Now his life in the drain, a triflin' shame
He all washed up, wife took e'rything
No car, no mo', no HOUSE
And everywhere he go, he stole, so they throwed him out
I was growin' up, lookin' up to be like them
Now I'm throwin' up cash, rollin' up in the Bent
I was stuck wit a dream I had since a shorty
I be DAMNED if I let another man support me, now
Uncle Junebug's sick, skinny as hell
He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared
E'rytime he get his welfare checks, he don't care
You wanna see him go to the crack house, he there

[Hook]

When you got big dreams
When you got big dreams ("even-even if they look lost forever")
When you got big dreams
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the waste side, reach for the sky
("even-even-even if they look lost forever")[Verse One:]
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical dooches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' Moet is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin, music blastin'
But I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweetie I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benz's
C-Notes by the layers, true fuckin players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

[Hook:]
(I love it when you call me big pop-pa] x3
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a tru playa
To the honies gettin money playin niggas like dummies
If you gun up in your waist, don't shoot up the place
Cause I see some ladies tonite that should be havin my ba-by
Baybee, uh

[Verse Two:]
Straight up honey really I'm asking
Most of these niggas think they me mackin', but they be acting
Who they attractin' with that line
"What's your name, what's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
Ask you what your interest are, who you be wit?
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Or three o' clock, Lil Ceas pull the truck up out the parking lot
Roll a blunt cause he like to spark a lot
Steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs, and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (truuuue)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movay, in the jaccuzay, bay-bay

[Hook]

[Verse Three:]
(How does a true playa live?)
Nigga, Versace down
Donna Karan, Diamonds glarin', Niggas starin'
Now I got my pants draggin in the Benz wagon
Raggin' sippin' D.P on my way to D.C
The biggest willies, smokin' phillies
Thai & skunk together, Junior M.A.F.I.A. forever
Thuggin to say youngin and you knows that
I steps in where the Mo and the Hoes at (Baybee)
Niggas know the better on the Coogi sweater
Butter leather, chrome beretta see
You know who that nigga be

[Outro: Jermaine Dupri]
Shit you ain't know, ha ha, That's the stride for ninety-five Baby
Straight up playerlistic mentality
You just do your thing, Cause I'm definintley gone do mine
And we gon' hook up a lil later and do thing you never heard of
Can you feel me?

Take, take, take it down to the ground with me now
Shake, sh-sh-shake it all around the town with me now
What ya gonna do, shorty?
What ya gonna do?[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I- love you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change ya
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Hook]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feeling ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Oh oh oh oh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been eleven days, um-teen hours
I'mma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

[Hook]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gonna learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn)
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (oh)
I'm twisted cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)

[Breakdown]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
Ooh ooh oh (can ya hear me burnin'?)
Ooh ooh ooh oh ooh oh

So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return

On a mission whisin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
(In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin niggas down like Evander Holyfield, geah)

[Verse 1]
I might come to your toooooown, shut a show dooooooown (okay)
Got the whole crowd screamin', "Lil' Bow Wooooow"
Without the "Lil'" but I'm still on top
Back with S.S.D. record sales won't flop (nah)
That's what you thought, but I'm in that new Porshe
No box earrings, chain on no watch (that's big)
Picture a grandfather clock with DII-amonds
That's just the kinda mind state that I'mmm in
Caviar, Cartier, carterdrop
On my neck, call her dead cute shorty called liner (come heeere)
I'm on my p's and my q's
Stones green to the blue 23's when I cruise
Feel my calf muscle on the gas and the brake pedal
Ain't another youngin' on my bank level (where you at?!)
I'm right hurr, neva late, please see clurrr, its no blurrrr, yes surrr

[Hook 1 1/2X with Snoop and Bow Wow's line switched around]

I'm on leer jets, know what make your face
From your tears wet while you rockin' last years SWEATS
Swag, yeah, I got it Prada bags for my luggage
Face on-screen for everything I does in the pub-lic
Boy won-da, make the other boys won-da
How we keep it comin' different e'ry summa
Don't be amazed cause of me
Be amazed cause the V came with a five year opped-out lease
Yea...that's cause I paid what I paid
If you paid like I'm paid, then yo' cribs came wit the maids
And if it didn't, then you slippin', catch up
But by the time you do, I'll probably do it different
I'm advanced, see the pants, see the kicks
See the stones on the risk, you see the phone on my hip? (where it at?!)
It's right thurr, up to date, please see clurrr, its no blurrr, yes surrr

[Hook 2 with Snoop and Bow Wow's line switched back around]

[Snoop Dogg]
Shootin' niggas down, slappin' bitches up
Straight cash strut with some Henny in my cup
Rude for the hell of it, I should be the president
Aye yo homey, Doggy Dogg got the medicine
(Where, where?) In the cabinet, I'm the magnet
Of attracting the baddest bitches on the planet, dig it (dig it, dig it)
I once was a pup, neva scared to run up
I did it 'til the day I came up
And stars do shine, I take my 32 lines and try to make you unwind
First I, chop 'em and den some, flop 'em then flip 'em
Break 'em and bend 'em, then fix 'em
Convince 'em to buy my records, cause you know it's all hits
Spread the word cause you know it's the shit!
Quit playin', go get it, quit hesitatin'
It's the young and the big on tha real my nig'

[Hook 4X]Sample: Don't Stop Till You Get Enough

Yo, yo
Yo, if you gonna hit niggas' girl
Just expect niggas to hit your girl
And that's it
112 help me say

[112]
1 - If she got with you when
She already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you)
If she got with you when
She already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you)

[Mase]
Mase, come on
If I'm in the streets or I'm in my jeep
And I wit my peep, ex know not to speak
See it's all good, and it's all sweet
All women flirt, all women cheat
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach
Out or in the sheets blaze plenty freaks
Be the bad boy everybody wanna meet
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat
If I ain't work late, I say I was wit my peeps
And quick to tell a ho, yo I ain't get the beep
And all these girls is quite the same
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name

Repeat 1

[Lil' Cease]
Ain't nobody hotter than the jam, don dada
Been around the world with girls at Ramada
Never been the one that chick, lotta scotta, protta
And yo when Cease got a girl he gotta
Though I love a ghetto girl that keep her doobie fly
39 in my Benz them niggas and super size
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I
If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't be givin' her pearls
If you know that she cheap why you live with the girl
Half you cats couldn't live in my world
Cuz you couldn't picture another nigga hittin' your girl (what?)

Repeat 1

[Jay-Z]
Is it because my game is stronger, name last longer
On the brain like a whole eighth but can
Chicks stop, mesmerize rub up on they tetas
Like push up bras, who you dealin' with ma, he's jigga
You know the rawest, ice is flawless baby
Nice is lawless, recite for balla's
And I fools ya'll fake players every time
Cuz you only hit chicks that you think is mine
You know how I paid his due, but I'm unfatable
Mommy screamin' pappi can I skate wit you
They wanna ride wit me, stay fly wit me
Wanna help me get rid of my rivalries
Wanna be the ebony to my ivory
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase dough
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin'
I get Shirley Murdock, I hope your door slam lock, I'm gone

Repeat 1

[Mase]
Yo, you can't think you gonna be cheatin and the girl ain't gonna cheat
Just like you cheat, they could cheat
And I just think, you a fool if you think girls don't cheat[Intro: Usher]
Uhh, Ohh, Ohh, Hey.....
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
What Ya'll Wanna 'do
What Ya'll Wanna 'do  (tell me)

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
See around here
We're just too much
We could slow it down and ya still couldn't
Catch us
My town
Full of heavy hitters
Bread getter
Real fly unforgettable type niggas
See all I do is keep hittin' em  up
Getting' em up
Shakin' ya but
Nigga, what
Lil Liberaci
Can't nobody stop me
Always's makin' moves
So you better watch me
Slide
To the southside in my blue drop top
355 keep' it live
When ya wanna make em jump (jump)
You know what to do
Call me and my crew
To the rescue
Captain So So Def
We rocks the party til there's no one
Left , (4, show)
Trun ya volume up a notch
And watch the ba bomb, bump, bump, bump
Make yo' speakers pop
You never missed your water til your well runs
Dry
I never missed my woman til she said good - bye
Now my heart made a change
My whole world's rearrange
And I'm ready
To give you what you deserved
Baby, baby, baby please

[Hook: Usher]
Come back, Come back
Lover this is where you belong
In my arms, in my world
Come back, Come back
Lover this is where you belong
In my life, as my girl
The grass is greener
On the other side
We take people for granted til they're
Out of sight
I don't think that you know how much I'm   going through
I don't think that you know how much I really love you

[Verse 2: Usher]
All I do
Is think of you
I can't eat
Can't sleep
Baby it ain't hard to see (all I do)
All I do
Is think of you
And ya bump, diggy bump, bump, bump
Diggy, diggy, bump, bump, baby

[Hook: Usher]

[Outro]
It's not what you want baby
But what you need surger
Come back with me
Satisfaction guaranteed baby[Hook: 2x]
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long
Girl I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that...

[Verse: 1]
Every time I was in L.A. I was with my ex girlfriend
Every time you called I told you, "Baby, I'm workin'"
(No!) I was out doing my dirt
(Oh!) wasn't thinking bout you getting hurt
(I) was hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center like man
Not givin' a damn who sees me
So gone (I know)
So wrong (just listen)
Acting like I didn't have you sittin' at home
Thinking about me
Bein' the good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you got a good man
A man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself it ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse: 2]
If I could turn back the hands of time and start all over I would
Instead of everything bein' all bad baby everything will be all good
I don't wanna lose you but I know what I'm telling you ain't gon' make you wanna stay
Probably just wanna run away
I'm mad enough to punch me in my face
I've been living like an idiot
And I deserve every bit of it (I know!)
I know today is the day I end all the lying and the playing and the bullshit girl!
I'm sorry
Baby I'm sorry
But I can no longer walk around with this stress on my chest
I confess...

[Hook]Watch this...

[Hook:]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I dont know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said "one second baby please hear me"

[Hook]

[Breakdown]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

[Hook][Intro: Consequence]
Uh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need y'all to bounce for me. Uh. I need y'all to bounce for me. What? I need y'all, I need y'all

[Hook: Usher]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

[Consequence talking over the hook]
Yeah, yo Chi. L-Roc. I got a confession to make. [?] running these streets. And that's with Kan Man. Kanye West. GLC. And of course your boy from the 1-9-3...Con to the quence. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Word up. Let's go

[Verse One: Consequence]
I got a mess that can't be mopped up
Chilling with my girl and guess who popped up
A chick from the road that says she's knocked up
Next thing I know your boy's locked up
Cause the one I rocked up is worse than upset
Wish I could take it back, reverse the blood test
Cause I was in the hood getting hooptie love
Till I hit the road and groupie love
Stacked all my paper got a crew with dubs
Now I'm the one that all the groupie's love
But how I'mma tell my secret to a pillow talker?
That's too caught up and she's still a stalker
My days are darker
Fate is altered
And me and baby girl ain't make the alter
But after all of that I done learned my lessons
Matter of fact, these are my confessions

[Hook]

[Kanye talking over the hook]
Yeah. Kanye To The...The Roc is in the building

[Verse Two: Kanye West]
My nigga Usher called me, said a chick caught him and she bawling, crying
Said she got his baby and he say she lying
But he can't deny it, he went raw dawg
Aw nah, hell nah
You don' up and done it man
I remember ol' girl, yep
Met her on tour
I seen your baby, he dance good as hell...it's yours!
You don't realize, you just made a ghetto girl's dreams
She don't need a ring cause she got you till he 18
And I know you want to know, was there room in them jeans
And you get ass so I won't assume you was fiendin'
But these girls is genius's, we thinking with our penis's
In my opinion, that's when they take us to the cleaners

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Usher]
Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said "one second baby please hear me"

[Hook]

[GLC talking over hook]
Almost cried, but I'mma player so I do how I do it. I'm GLC. Hood Celebrity, know what I'm talkin' bout?

[Verse Four: GLC]
Baby I was broke and I was pimping 'em girl
She gave me her world and I ain't give her nothin'
I knew she was frontin'
You can ask for real, I'm GLC, I get it how I live
Weight on my shoulders like the Man Of Steel
I get it like a champ, I ran through her camp
I only hit her cause you wasn't there
Baby where was you at?
She bought me some sounds, bought me an ounce
I ain't bought nothing, I ain't high or nothin'
Last time you said I was trying to hit your cousin
Until I told you I wasn't
Baby I'm sorry for the pain impression
Let me replace it with pleasure
If you gon' cry don't ask them questions
Let's listen to Usher, that's my confession

[Hook][Intro: Usher]
Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get this off my chest about all the shit I've been hearing babe I
I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life I took in
Your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
If you were gonna tell it then you told instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing
Cause if I really start talking it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated
So be it
We need to leave it alone
Move on

[Call waiting beeping]
[Usher] Hold up
[Operator] Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility will you accept the charges?
[Usher] Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?

[Shyne - rapping on the phone]
Sittin' in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walking on this earth is
That night, I would've got murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it

[JD]
Uh, listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So So Def

[Hook - Usher] (J.D.)
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions

[JD]
If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic, Twista!

[Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus Coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days
I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that just when I thought I could really try to get away
Or have another woman on the side
But I never knew it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson
If you stay wit' me then it'll be a blessin'
No stressin', it'll never be no guessin'
Cause I'm pourin' out my heart and these are my confessions

[Hook]

[Kanye West:]
Man, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin'
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret, you famous you can't go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there, it's hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "Man, don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin' on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back

[Hook]

[JD]
Po! That's the boy Shyne, y'all
The boy on his way home, man
The boy on his way home, man![Jennifer Lopez:]
No me puedo controlar
Aqui con el Señor LL Cool J
Y aqui estoy... ya tu sabes
Uno, dos, tres, muevete!

[Jermaine Dupri:]
Ya'll know what this is...So...So...Def!

[Verse 1:]
[LL Cool J:]
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said

[Chorus:]
[Jennifer Lopez:]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

[LL Cool J:]
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)

It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself

[Jennifer Lopez:]
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 2:]
[LL Cool J:]
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it

[Both:]
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the afterparty is at my body
Meet me you're invited

[LL Cool J:]
She said

[Chorus:]
[Jennifer Lopez:]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

[LL Cool J:]
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)

It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself

[Jennifer Lopez:]
It's hard for me to control myself (Say what)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 3:]
[LL Cool J:]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you (make me hurt you)

[Jermaine Dupri:]
She said

[Chorus:]
[Jennifer Lopez:]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

[LL Cool J:]
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself (Oh)
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)

It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself

[Jennifer Lopez:]
It's hard for me to control myself (Say what)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[LL Cool J:]
ZihZih ZihZihZih
ZihZihZih ZihZih ZihZihZihZihZih
ZihZihZih ZihZih ZihZih ZihZih ZihZih ZihZih ZihZih

[Jermaine Dupri:]

Youngbloodz.. come out and play {*laughs*}

To Youngbloodz (ya know?!) Uh Lil' Jon (yeah!)
(Yeah! yeah!) Bonecrusher (yeah!)
And my man Ludacris (let's go!) let's go!

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Yeek yeek motherfucker going four years strong
Got plenty haters really wishing I ain't last this long
And please don't get it twisted I ain't Hollywood yet
I just jumped in that movie to get a big ass check (that's right)
So fool break yourself, that's the phrase that pays
I'm bout to open my own shop AK's and Chevorlet's
I just bought 20 acres and I'm still in the hood
They like damn, Luva Luva doing pretty damn good (that's right)
When it comes to this paper I don't slack to get it
But call me lazy cause my crib's got an elevator in it
That's right, it's sorry to say but it's harder to see
And I don't have to hit the club I bring the party to me
Cause I'm the Lord of Lords and the King of the Kings
I never claim to be hard just down for my team
Shawnna, 20, Chingy, Tity and Fate
I grab a booty and pinch then lick a titty and shake

[Sean Paul]
Now I'm back in the street working stacking my bread
Put some in the hood cause I got plent to spread
Bought a brand new 'Lac on some brand new feet
Wit a brand new grill shining like gold teeth
Still ride wit AK's, still a sweep the street
But I'm a real G and I ain't got no time for beef
I don't change for na nigga I'm a part of the street
And live life everyday like it's a party to me
But I'm fa sho wit it, if there's money to be made boy I'm a go get it
Split it wit the hood again get some throw wit it
Catch me swervin through your hood no we didn't did it
Straight up sippin on some Henny ain't no coke in it
I leave the change for the suckas
Separate the hard motherfucker from all the bustas
To the grinders and the hustlers so I know that you feel me
Put your hood up in the air and represent for your city (yeah!!)

[Hook - Ludacris & (Lil' Jon)] {*Bone Crusher in background*}
If you don't give a damn we don't give a fuck! (hey!)
If you don't give a damn we don't give a fuck! (hey!)
If you don't give a damn we don't give a fuck! (hey!)
If you don't give a damn we don't give a fuck! (hey!)
(Don't start no shit there won't be no shit!)
(Don't start no shit there won't be no shit!)
(Don't start no shit there won't be no shit!)
(Don't start no shit there won't be no shit!)

[Verse 2 - J-Bo]
Now who the hell wanna tangle my angle I'm setting off
To the party no Bacardi, like Crusher, we breaks 'em off
Youngbloodz and Ludacris, in which you know the name
We burning through yo speakers like big balls of flames
And pimpin like hurricanes, we blowing through ya town
Whipin out ya system and shutting the club down
Cause we - don't give a fuck, already you know the deal
Like soldiers we walk soft (shh) so listen close and clear
Cause we gon' act a fool and send chumps back to school
Then teach them motherfuckers to never break the rules
Lesson one - some pimps don't never crack the style
Lesson two - respect it, been doing it for a while
A-Town's our bound, we bumping down ya block
Switching from lane to lane, you know it don't stop
We back and still foolish and poppin like once befo
So go and throw it up, my people now hit the flow (yeah!!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bone Crusher]
I won the strong arm competition, in '94
For benching 600 hundred pounds, and no mo'
That equal six of ya featherweights that goin to hit the flo'
So if a nigga wanna buck, then a nigga need to know
I'm serious with this, pardon my French but I'm the shit!!
I'm six fucking seconds away from catching these bricks
When it's all said and done and I engulf the sun
Pathetic ass, fucking mortals, when you ho niggas learn
I grind for this paper, shake a nigga down for this paper
These under 'chiever niggas always hate ya
So you gotta keep it mean, and lock and load on these cakers
Ya'll niggas harder then my daughter on a 7 o'clock wake up
Youngbloodz and Bone Crusher, fuck niggas discover
Put them fight strips on ya and watch ya suffer
They call me mutilator, a bitch nigga bluffer
Want ya see me in the streets with all that mean mug brother, ya bitch!
(yeah!!)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don't let that drank get ya FUCKED UP nigga!
