[Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes]

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio
You're right back on it reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered, but tonight I bet ya that what
You're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this"
Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to getcha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you, the cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
And...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology, or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch, man
Door handles unlocked
Shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag
Gag, almost hack-up a lung, like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat; you can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now, wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt, this should be fun
Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God, police aaaghh)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan, Slim "chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again

[Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner]

[Verse 4]
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over
Here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished
"I am your lack of a conscience"
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate
That you became with every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult, batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of 'em
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so”
Foreshadows of all the, things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have but, as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time
I'm back, before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the, final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable, here goes a wild stab in the dark, uh
As we (I) pick up where the last Mathers left off[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck ya'll with a sick dick, Semi automatic no click click
We don't feel you like an elephant, gettin' fucked with a tick dick
Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch
I gotta put that patch over my third eye, Slick Rick
Trukfit, T-Shirt, talk second, skeet first
Boy yo girl a jump off, I hope she land feet first
She give me brain, research, and I prefer, reefer
But if you want some coke, that's cool, cause my homies still

[Hook]
Yeah my homies still
My homies still
Yeah my homies still
Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, yeah
Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My girls and cars both skirt off
I like a pussy so wet that I can surf off
In a hot spot cause a nigga never chillin'
I do it for my niggas, I just do it to these bitches
Boy, I overgrind, overshine
Ain't another nigga over Sean
I'm getting paid, it's Oprah time
I’m rollin' pine, I’m so divine
I’m West side, West side
Dark glasses on like I'm goin' blind
Looking like Eazy E, it’s just me and Lil Weezy-we
Get off my dick!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Look, I’m east side them haters 90 going west
My niggas pumping so much bass, muthafuckas going deaf
Weezy F, I'm east side them haters 90 going west

Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, I don’t love them hoes
Got so much coke, you gon' need another nose
Man I just play my hand, but I am not the dealer
You see I got them tear drops, I cry yo ass a river
I got that Trukfit t-shirt, listenin' to Rebirth
I skate until my feet hurt, hot boy, free Turk
Pussy for dessert
Put your ass beneath Earth
And I don’t sell drugs, but if you need work
My homies still

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Whoa, okay, boi this here’s what I do do
Got your sister dancing, not the kind that's in a tutu
Got me in control, no strings attached, that's that voodoo
She said can’t nobody do it better, I tell her, true true yep bitch true true
My my bro bro say these bitches ain't shit
I got the girl you came with and the girl she came wit’
She leaking and drippin’, whoa there I might just come slip in

If she addicted to what my dick did
Boy I get it
(Lil Bitch!)

[Hook-Extended]

Truk yo girl[Intro]
Yuck Daddy
Yuck Daddy

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Cut the top off, call it Amber Rose
Just bought a big body, time to paint the toes
Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talking on the FLX phone
Poof, just like that the whole check gone
Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun gang, all-black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in her tummy
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before Benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots then we send em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black Mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy Trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the girls, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that
Nigga I'm so dope, you could catch a fucking contact

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Good weed, bad bitch
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt
Woah I seen it all before
The bitch gotta man but she scheming on the low
How it go, it go fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
My homies got the blickers, automatics no clickers
Codeine, no liquor
Man life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger
I'm fucked, let's fuck
She said she on her period, I said yuck
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
Two big chains, one big chopper bitch

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I got the chopper for the correspondents
The codine got me standing horizontal
I had enough of the broken promises
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontases
And this shit is off the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, laying with my seat back
We next, weed never left Holland, weed bag
All this ice on me and my niggas playing freeze tag
Lord forgive me, this my fourth foreign
If you baby daddy lame, you should forewarn him
I come through with the yopper on
Turn that nigga into hot bologna
I'm the type a nigga cop a Rolly, cop a Benz, cop a tool
Then wear it all to Church, nigga Hallelu
Uh, I'm from the trap where the block'll pay you
Me and my nigga pass your ho like a hot potato
I be like you could get her
He be like you could get her
I be like you could have her
He be like you could have her
He be like it don't matter
I be like, me neither
Uh, my old school got twenty-sixes on it
And I got you girl kissing on me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yuck Daddy, yuck
Yuck Daddy, yuck
Yuck-yuck-yuck Daddy
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch[Verse 1]
Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'mma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick her flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

[Hook]
Damn you the shit
And I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby, with you and only you

[Verse 2]
I say damn I must be left
Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now she don't know about me but I'mma put her on it
And she ain't sure up out me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair her could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

[Hook][Hook]
I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

[Bridge]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

[Hook][Intro x2]
Would you do it for the love?

[Verse 1]
Could've left a long time ago, fuck it where I’ma go?
A brother back in the house couldn’t let Obama go
Do it cause you love it nigga, advice from my momma go
Those that just follow green, be the first kind to go
Being broke ain’t a joke, I’m too comical
Seven digits nigga, 2 commas ho
Make your first million and don’t make it your last
Don’t come if you ain’t ready, don’t try to make it too fast
You can’t learn shit, if you never make it to class
You can’t just recycle what should be placed in the trash
I started wanted more money, and a Stacey dash
A car that cost a house and a place to crash
Pull the hammer like a camera; you don’t wanna face the flash
Cause you’ll lose one of your sons and it’s no replacing Nash
Bet the faces you show be the same faces you stash
There’s more where that came from, y'all know where I came from
It’s all about that boy that call me papi
So I’m a keep making that paper copy
You squares could never stop me, that triangles to play me
Two lines for you fuck boys, now pause that, play me
Right from where I left off that, let’s get back to that real shit
That sit back just chill shit. With packs of that kill shit
I chit chat bout trill shit, spit that hot feel shit
I give you four bars it’ll be a Kit Kat of some real shit
Who fucking with me? I mean besides your bitch
I Deebo your ho, you niggas should hide your bitch
Like the chain red’s grandmomma gave him
I got a thing for women, I like them misbehaving
You know like bad, mike bad
So I’ma check’em when I see’em Nik(e) AD
Cause in this life things come and go like fast
And I’m not one who favors using words like had
I’m into having shit, turning dreams to average shit
Bring your trophy to the club, Dallas Maverick shit
Niceeee
I came from first of the month money
To waking up whenever I want money
Niceee
I chase paper, I hunt money
Make 50 racks at 3pm and call it lunch money
Niceeee
Nigga ya stunt money is blunt money
Your boo only got a text back once from me
And that was “What the fuck you want from me?”
But I know what the fuck she want from me, yeah

[Bridge]
You ain’t gotta front for me
I know, I know what you want from me
I know, I know we all want the money
It’s only right we getting to it
Question I come to you with is...

[Hook x8][Intro]
I hate gossip
And I don't walk around lookin' for it, you know?
But, yesterday it seemed to just wander around 'til it found me
You know like, the gossip found me
Then why don't try provin' it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well, what you just do is, stop

[Verse 1]
Stop, hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion, the lady of a nigga
And you could get tipped like you're waitin' on a nigga
Put a body bag and an apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you could never see if you sit behind the light
And you don't have to pick me to win the title fight
But I'mma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is Snow White
I'm tryna be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fuckin' po-lice
And my flow is rare, these other rappers nice
These other rappers bark, some of 'em even bite
But I'm much more bright, I give the game sight
So before you dim the light you just might, might wanna

[Refrain]
Think it over , think it over
Ooooh, think it over
Think it over, baby baby
(Get 'em)

[Verse 2]
Stop, analyzing, criticizing
You should realize what I am and start epitomizing
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion
I'm confident like fuck 'em all, pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city, cause my city's crying
Because my city's dying
Still I emerge from all of that, I am a living pioneer near Zion
Fear God not them
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the boot
And soo-woo, and then I leave a tub in the booth, I leave a bloodbath
Sorry there's a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe, no, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the string on a boot, now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I must ask

[Refrain 2]
Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

[Verse 3]
Drag my name through the mud, I come out clean
Cast away stones, I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem, I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gone need cheese if I'm bakin' the ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica, where weed be
Hard body nigga, just takin' it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers, why do rappers, lie to fans, lie to rappers
Lotta rappers, lie like actors, cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga fuck your props
And make it out to Mr. Hip-Hop
I'm not dead, I'm alive[Verse 1: Vado]
What happened? Who shot? Who buck and who ran off?
These rappers ain’t hot the fuck they got fans for?
I’m back in the spot, with bundles they hand off
Meet me another block askin' what’s the expand cost
It’s a hard job that fell for raw scarf
Left hand steer,Cartier was all polish
Light knit wear, I don’t pitch the hard
Maserati whip, serve bricks to the carwash
Who’s on the menu? Hunned deep at the venue
Hunned keys who I sent to, turn the weed up the mental
Was in a rental, I done turned down in Pennsylvania
Pistol mania, streets official

[Hook: Kevin Cossom & Vado]
2 fingers in the air for the ones before
Middle finger in the air for the ones that hate
Ain’t no more love
Sorry but it’s gotta be this way
Stackin' all day, trappin' all day
Back with more yay, we clappin' your way
I’m a survivor, I’m a rider
Bet you don’t move
When it’s on this side, no
It’s been so long but we finally arrived
We stackin' all day, trappin' all day
Back with more yay, we clappin' your way

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
You’re looking at a new school legend
Gift out of Heaven
Preachin' that real, yeah I'm something like a Reverend
Livin' by the code, bend nor fold
Black man wearin' 100 G's worth of gold
Iced out watches, shirt from Versace
King of the south I am, wuddup Gotti?
Been speak bout it, money no karate
Profit go to flippin' now they think I’m Illuminati
What you came here for? I’m in the Django clothes
Niggas want my life, they wanna take my soul
See I done switched my flow just like I do with my hoes
Now they know I’m the truth but why it took so long?
Know the Maybach comfy and the kush so strong
No my thoughts ain’t right, I can’t do nothing wrong
I’m so gifted, hear my voice and get lifted
Came from the trenches, gun shots to ditches,listen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vado]
I’m quick to grab 9’s when a man hate
Been getting bad vibes from they handshakes
I’mma act fly 'til my land day
No need to ask why my nigga man straight
Long line for the dope that’s a fan base
Hog tie with the ropes, what yo fan face?
Mob ties with the coke, make the plan great
4-5 to his throat, where’s the damn safe?
Khaled you know it’s time
When they see me they’ll see Po in his prime
Rich when he was rich, the industry von zip
Gazelles like Dred Scott, Ciele’s my bread copped

[Hook][Intro]
I asked him if he wanted me to hustle up his bail, but he said "No."
He just didn't give a damn anymore

[Hook]
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door

[Verse 1: Papoose]
They would say “bling-bling,” if my jewels could talk
So you can still see me shining when the room gets dark
I’m like Tony Danza, I’ll show you who’s the boss
Teach my worker who’s the fiends and who’s the narcs
It’s a lot of niggas out trying to prove they hard
‘Til you hit they cousin up, and make them move they aunt
Yo, I would wild out and let the Rug’ just spark
But you know how the hood be when someone screwed your start
All the basketball tournaments was cool to watch
Bet your money: lose a little, or lose a lot
They beat us by one point – yeah, them dudes was sharp
But I’m a sore loser, so I had to shoot up the park
I wouldn’t of robbed your man if the fool was smart
But a fool and his money will soon depart
Then I went to my crib, went to sleep 'bout four
When I woke up, police was at my door, damn…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Just aired the dice game out, that’s the truth, babe
‘Bout to hit the crib, take a shower, watch a bootleg
Glad nothing popped off, got to get the bag out of the crib
Goose dropped off, so it can get knocked off
Then I got a sharp pain in my chest
About knowing I ain’t supposed to have it in the place I rest
Yes, but it’s a half a joint in there
Two .40 cals with the hollow points in there
Few bricks of diesel, couple pounds of purple
Gallon of the water, plus a thousand circles
A man hit me, saying that he’d be here in a minute
All I’ve got to do is wrap it, and bring it down to the rented
By now, it’s a little past five
And I’m still trying to roll, could barely open my eyes
Next thing I know, she giving me a massage
Instead of waking up rich, I woke up to a surprise

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
It goes, “Six in the morning, police at my door”
At five in the morning, I was up in this broad
At four in the morning, we was out the club door
A few hours before that, I was getting fresh in the store
Now a week before that, I was at the car lot
Thinking convertible so I can make the broad drop
A half a mill in cash off a three-month run
Them rubber bands stacks in ten-G lump sums
Police is on our back ‘cause we dump guns
So when Bird Gang’s outside, motherfucker, just run
We just dumb, like the hyphy life
I told you life was a bitch, not the wifey type
Help you get the right bricks, if the price is right
Catch you standing on the strip in the icy whites
Season of heirs, we in the V switching gears
Dropping the top, blowing weed in the air
She’s showing her ass, and
Next think I know, I’ve got a detective all in my face
Asking me all kinds of questions
I don’t know shit but get my lawyer

[Hook][Hook]
I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

[Bridge]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

Sometimes you have to take it a day at a time
You know when you hear that Haaaaa

[Hook: Tiara Thomas & French Montana]
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Livin' good today
I hear the (gun shot), but I'm here to stay
Just another day livin' in the hood
Just another day in the hood
Didn't have to use the K today
Made it through another day

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
In my hood everyday niggas get locked down
Best friends hit on your girl and get 'em knocked down
Teachers tell you quick, you niggas'll never be shit
Dropped so much coke in the water, could make the sea sick
All I hear is sirens and sounds of guns blastin'
A little girl went missin' but ain't nobody askin'
My nigga Lil Troy hit the bank said he need cash
Seen him on the news I guess he forgot the ski mask
Strippers and celebrities, Instagram's a lick
Niggas rantin bout gay, cause ignorance is bliss
Shorty changin' food stamps just to get high
Listenin' to Stevie, "Ribbon in the Sky"
Homie reminiscin', I'm keepin' him in my prayers
Cause Joe crack cares, even if no one else cares
See me on the screen but I'm still the same G
They thought I'd never see outside of 5V

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Welcome home my nigga Joe Crack
Bust a bottle of that black shit lets go
New seven series charcoal gray Bimmer
Joe Crack, Dope Boy, nigga Don Cartegena
All the sixes we collect, bitches we could sex
Phone still tapped so it's best to send a text
Go and do a bid back home just like a king
Bucket full of crab, money bags that we seen
From Rikers to Fisher Isle, digits to digits pilin'
New Wraith with soft plates, long as the bitches smilin'
Ciroc boy, AP on the rocks
New Sunseeker, four mill on a yacht
I came from the mud, Def Jam the new plug
Five gold joints and still gets no love
I walk the same block, rode the same trains
We fucked the same bitches, whipped the same cane
(Boss!)

[Hook][Verse 1]
C.O.B in this bitch, wave the black flag
Different kind of gang member, house nigga, back back
I tell my bitch pussy pop on a handstand
While the world going to hell in her Louis handbag
It ain't the end of the world, but it's like the end is starting
Adam Lanza killing 20 children in a kindergarten
Wade Michael Page shooting up a Sikh Temple
George Zimmerman the reason I'mma keep pistols
Even though I don't fuck with the NRA
Cause the CEO Wayne LaPierre, yo what he say
Man he try to blame violence on rap music and video games
Like we out here killing for any old thing
If I was reckless I would tell you rappers give me your chain
A million views on Vimeo
I creep low through the Savannah, I'm hunting you, gazelle and deer
What's that? I can smell your fear
I'm a apex predator

[Hook]
Ridin' in the Coupe, man
Real niggas, we the top of the food chain
Don't make me turn the whole club into a shootin' range
King of the jungle, fuck with me my gun go bang
My gun go bang, my gun go bang, and my gun go
Fuck with me my gun go bang, my gun go bang, and my gun go bang
My gun go bang!

[Verse 2]
I'm a apex predator, pineal gland in forefront
On your third eye, graduated to my fourth one
You cross us in the street nigga, you're done
Like a child support judge, we hold court son
Glen Beck want us all to die
And Ted Nugent want us all to die
But real niggas don't die
We like that shopping center bag full of tissue, we multiply
I know I reached for that one
No serial numbers, you know I reach for that gun
I call on Bonnie, she my right hand girl
I can't even turn my music up in this white man's world
If I do, I get shot by a psycho's favorite gun
Sorta like Jordan David was my Michael David Dunn
We need help, won't nobody listen to them hollow tips that's hittin' politicians
I'm a apex predator

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bang, hit em up, perfect execution
I'm in the underground training for the revolution, you niggas scared of shootin'
You ain't gotta agree with Darwin to stand your monkey ass up, this is evolution
I knew that rebel G shit would be back soon
For you thousand dollar house, niggas call you rap coons
I hang with foreign mobsters and black goons
Type of people that'll strike fear into a packed room
They ain't afraid of my nine though
They in fear of what my mind know
They know I ain't walkin' with my eyes closed
My entourage is camouflaged by nice clothes
Blood in our veins is ice cold cause we apex predators!

[Hook][Hook: Royce da 5'9"]
What the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young nigga get money anymore?
Can y'all bums get funny anymore?
Can my life get sunny anymore?
Back the fuck back 'fore I fuck you up
Ay! Back the fuck back 'fore I fuck you up
You better back the fuck back 'fore I fuck you up
(Slaughterhouse!)

I came, I saw
I conquered, I'm a monster
Back the fuck back 'fore I fuck you up
You better back the fuck back 'fore I fuck you up

[Verse One: Royce da 5'9"]
Feeling like the greatest, Motor City's finest
My crew looking Jamaican, I'm rolling with the grinders
They calling me old head, but so what the car's young
I set the bar with the bars even though I'm bar none
Hot car, top's off, hot broad, rockstar
Watch not flawed; turn y'all to watch dogs. knock it off
I'm too pretty to fight, this gonna end fast
My clip long as Sinbad is when it's on its tenth blast
Fuck y'all radio play, fuck y'all radio stations
Long as I'm paid, my lady built like a long-legged alien
If it all ended today, I can honestly say
I performed and recorded with the greatest, word on The Chronic to Dre
Now I'm as polished as Obama wiping down a diamond
With the ass of Diamond from Crime Mob
After she’s had a shiny Armani hind-job
I’ma be straight
And you can pick a rapper, any rapper, and line up the date
I’m in a zone where the fuck is the ref with the whistle?
Don’t gotta impress you, I just diss you
The press pretzels the issue
My homie Joey showed me the net
And I went and got me a gross net fiscal
I’ll stretch you like the tek is a Bowflex pistol
So don’t bet
You would prefer me to be coming with you like phone sex
With a sexy electrician whose next mission
Is to cut your buzz off if you don’t rap right
I ain’t wrapped tight but I’m just that gift
"Crack piff, mac spit, Cadillac flips"
We can match whips, battle rap dick
I’d rather have an actress on my mattress
Who giving me brain so long she don’t know jack shit
But how to do that dick
Fact shit confidence of a fat chick
Caught onto fashion from catchin bodies at Saxs and Fifth
I came, saw, and I conquered, pig gang
Y'all talkin I’m chainsawing your tonsils

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Out for lunch with my accountant
Back the fuck back down to Chase doing counting
My bitch back the fuck back it up when I’m pounding
Y'all funny style watching Broke-the-fuck-back-Mountain
Y'all tuned into the Slaughters, the group fathers hate
Cause we move in on their daughters, with shit news reporters
Holding their hand when they trying to get interviews in order
That’s a chico stick mami, come chew me I’m a quarter
Of the House Gang, call it the crib, mami
These niggas running trying to get in our seat, a bunch of Mitt Romney's
But I stand at the podium with the fifth by me
Screaming out “Yes we can, open yo shit Papi”
I rap well so I’m a bit cocky
From Maxell blank tapes with the tissue in it to disc copies
To downloads in one click, I’ll be
Still rhyming when music is telepathic you can come sit by me
I’ll stare at you with the rawest thoughts
CNN? Y'all think news, CNN? I think War Report
I say “Big L,” you say “weed”, I say Harlem’s boss
A legend I’m repping for him and all that my sport has lost
Hip-Hop ain’t just a way of life
It’s all I know, it’s what fill up my kid’s cutty day and night
When it got soft, y'all conformed, man I stand to fight
Y’all went Bathing Apes I went ape in my favorite Nikes
Back the fuck back bredren
I brought it back when rap was defective, please don’t ask me no questions
Friend or foe, speak quick
Or I’ll put this foot back the fuck back where you leak shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Jumped in my DeLorean, hopped in a ratchet era
Basic hoes with reality shows, bring back Ciara
Niggas fronting, Instagraming somebody's Panamera
Whack rappers ride to success smooth as Aloe Vera
Yes we're here, cause the shit needs to switch
Like niggas is robbing the poor just to feed the rich
Overcrowding markets, artists need a niche
In Slaughterhouse, our niche is, "Bitch, we's the shit"
So chicks want the dick in their midsection
Do I pay for pussy? That's a trick question
Problem's I bench pressed 'em
I'm on some mirrors in the gym, shit, I'm in this bitch flexing
Get used to it, we're back
You dudes ruining rap
More than a few view it as fact
Crack your Pro Tools with a bat
What kind of stupid ass music is that, no question mark
It's simply rhetorical, I'm simply historical
And you call yourself an MC? You're horrible
I'm simply an oracle
The impact you feel when you hit the ground kneeing the floor ?
I'm on my "yes-yes y'all"
My soldiers don't eat in no mess hall
My mind state's anti-sex doll, I don't fuck with you fake pussies
Who I'm talking about: I said yes y'all[Verse 1]
We serve teardrops, prolific flow from Jamaica
Wake up, we getting that bread like a baker
Take ya life like it's nothing, boys swing
I will blood clot everything from your block
To your offspring, you not hardcore
Wouldn't crack an egg, why the fuck you acting hard boiled?
Boom bye bye is the tune I abide by
I'm aligned with goons, it's wireless like wi-fi
Why try? I'm on the cusp of greatness
You bum-ba-cluts fly, I'm on a fuckin' spaceship
Enough in the bracelet to make the blind squint
I'm Eazy, Cube, Yella, Dre, Ren times ten, I'm a (Bad Boy)

[Verse 2]
Put you in a slumber, come on bruh
You a bum, you under my umbrella, I put you in the dumpster
Whatever, I ain't the Fella who you want Roc with
I will batty boy kill ya, fuck all that dumb shit
Put you up under concrete, I'm cut like a gauntlet
Beat ya like a blum blum drum stick
Mumble something I come through dumping
AK-47 pumping, blow like a trumpet
The foolishness of niggas bullshit
Who you trying to push bitch? Booyakah, full clip, don dada
You no test me Shabba Rank impostor
You no want drama I'm prepared for 'Nam, I'm a (Bad Boy)

[Verse 3]
You're in a headlock, tie your family up like a dread lock
Gong niggas like Junior Marley when the lead drop
Eat 'em like a meal while the fed watch
You married the street I just fucked it out of wedlock
Before I rip on ya, rasta should warn ya
They don't all love ya, push needles into the eyeballs
Of a little doll of ya, blind ya, align ya
Red rum with murder for hire, serve your supplier
Pill poppin' and coke snortin'
We kill for fun 'til we come for your fortune
Bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do?
When them killas come for you, I'm a (Bad Boy)[Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes]

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio
You're right back on it reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered, but tonight I bet ya that what
You're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this"
Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to getcha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you, the cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
And...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology, or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch, man
Door handles unlocked
Shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag
Gag, almost hack-up a lung, like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat; you can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now, wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt, this should be fun
Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God, police aaaghh)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan, Slim "chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again

[Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner]

[Verse 4]
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over
Here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished
"I am your lack of a conscience"
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate
That you became with every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult, batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of 'em
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so”
Foreshadows of all the, things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have but, as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time
I'm back, before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the, final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable, here goes a wild stab in the dark, uh
As we (I) pick up where the last Mathers left off[Verse 1: Scarface]
­I live just enough for the city so I get by
Money never changed how I felt, would I risk my
Life for a dollar, homie? Nah, I don't think so
Greed breeds jealous niggas out here wanting info's
Catch a nigga slipping, put a bullet in his temple
Homie, it's the same rules, money talks, simple. My kinfolk
Call it what I'm living like the high life
Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance, hieroglyphics keep the rhymes tight
My mind like, Game recognize that
Real recognize real, still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothing but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop running
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunning
Down the innocent, in the beginning it's:
"You was doing 50 in the 35"
The ending is: "You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questioning'"
Damn, a blessing in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last key
Could it be that maybe God is intervened
With my life like he did so many times in between?
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowing Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now it was back then, nothing stepped on
Dopeman, dopeman yelling
Cook it 'til it's rock hard, bag it up, sell it
Aroma so loud, so loud that you can smell it
Death to them niggas getting caught go and telling

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me
Homie, I'm just trying to be all I can be
But not for free, that's what the fuck be wrong
I need that

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Can't even believe this day here, my nigga
I remember us sitting in the parking lot talking about getting money

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Cracks in the wall, standing in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on, my nigga, as they walking back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's something for his mother
It never is enough, trying to show her that I love him
We were fishing buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas getting robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bending corners
Always keep in mind, you fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the agents
When you parking all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals dripping on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw
Scarface, Rick Ross: big boys
Big boys, Scarface, Rozay, we big boys

[Hook]

[Outro: Z-Ro]
I need that[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
BME, trust the truth's in the booth
He don't take a hit to let 'em know I'm bulletproof
Rest in peace Proof, this is no truce
This is hood music brought directly to you
Mac-11 in the Chevy with a nigga or two
Ready for whatever, we cuckoo, loose screw
Used to bungalows juicing up fiends
Just to ride 'round in the new school
Come from basehead rentals, same faces, no dental
Claiming they gon' pay incidentals
Give a fiend a break, he see God all in ya
Then he run game 'till your change all minimal
Pinning them predicaments to live that life
I been spending Benjamins since the early '90s
Now BME is where a nigga can find me
Still on the grind nigga still getting mine
Nigga I don't slip, handle 'em, rap's Rip Hamilton
All in his mansion, gambling
Alls I'm trying to do is match 'em, rapping
Get a couple chicks, I'm rambling, stab 'em

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..

For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money

Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Everyting is real on this concrete and steel
Niggas peel your cap for a happy meal
I got to deal with this ball of confusion, world of illusions
We ain't losin' playa (never), weez winnin'
Playin' every night when we sendin' paper chasing, grinin'
While you still chasin' women 'round tables no lieutenants
Use your own man grown, (hook it up)
It's Ice Cube and the family stone
Breakin' bread every night in L.A
And I pray, for one more day that's unate (check it)
It's 90 degrees no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall to his knees every night
I'm lovin' every breath like a cold sip of soda
While I'm bankin' down these back streets, thanks for lookin' over
Damn sure nice to know ya, fuck a four leaf clover
And thanks for this range rover
We gets down with this underground gangsta shit
Politians and parents, always havin' a fit
Everybody wanna know "who you with?" "where you from?"
Why you lookin' at me dumb?
Here's a bullet cause you number one

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Soulja boy swag, cold so polar
I got so many cars, Soulja boy motors
Pull up and I’m flexing on rodeo drive
I got 55 racks and my pocket going live
Stacks on deck boys, we all about them plays
I be like hold on homie, you don’t know what we hate
It be hood dre flexing and sod flexing
I be pulling up on pipes 24 and flexing
Everywhere we go you know that we winning
Big bank wrote a letter know that we winning
Everybody know that my whole squad is winning
Stacks on deck, we gonn kill em, we gonn kill em
I’m pulling up and I hurt the haters’ feelings
Everybody know Soulja boy straight grilling
I’m on the hook and it’s a great feeling
Taking over everyday, niggas straight drilling

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Like Iraq, C-4 in backpacks
You can pull straps but you can't match that
Thought you was lord of shit bitch, why you let him snitch?
Put the gun in your hand, now we can settle it
Put it up, to his head, I can't do it for ya
You, be the trigger man, kill your own brother
See, how it feels when he drops, and he bleeds
I handed you heat, it was your op-tion to squeeze
Drop, to your knees, look at me, and believe
There's only one way to get out of this thing
Barrel aimed at your face, cock back, fire straight
Now at least neither one of us'll catch a murder case
Flyin down the 5, flicked out, gettin high
Jump off on Lincoln, roll through, Anaheim
Rush, of a homicide, races, through my mind
Not commit, any crime anywhere, anytime


[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money[Verse 1: Royce]
Stop, picture me in scrubs in a room with hip hop
Operating on it with my instruments
I'm the doc It's crunch time
Line up rappers I don't like and call that shit a punch line
These niggas e-beefing that ain't what wars about
Ain't nothing dying but the game, pull the organs out
These niggas dissing like they wondering where Malcolm's at
Till I split em where they're scalp is at, where my scalpel at?
I ain't been hearing heart, I'm bout to check his pulse
With my stethoscope, pressed against the records tho
We ride in, we gonna W-I-N
I will check a bitch ass like a O-B-G-Y-N
I'm respected like a killer, a record like thriller!
I will keep a tab on you like Twitter!!
Now feel the hating grow, nickel give em oxygen and shock em with
That that defibrillator flow!!

[Hook]
As long as I'm alive the game gunna be breathing
Even though it's..... wheezing hit him like like clear clear
Wake his ass up he was sleeping
I said as long as I'm alive the game gunna be breathing
Even though it's.... wheezing hit him like like clear clear
Wake his ass up he was sleeping

[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]
I'm aliveeeeeeeee, they almost killed me but I survived
Hip hop has been revived
Surprise (Ok doc!) oww stop shocking me now
Tell your nurse that she can put this scalpel down
Im back ready to rap took a little nap ready to go off
Stick to my pen never again will I ever dose off
No more bozo rap it hurt me
The new dojo in beast mode, im John Cleese No mercy!!
My saliva and spit could fly through a brick
Put your ass by a light and spit gas at the fire flick
Gave up homie huh? I was worse than the racists and rapists
Now im feeling like kobe fore he scored 81
Really feeling new! missed me with the skinny jeans and uggs
Fuck outta here, I ain't feeling you!!
Fucking incredible!! I can dig a hole to hell
Just to beat the devil over the head with a fucking shovel!!

[Hook][Intro x2]
Would you do it for the love?

[Verse 1]
Could've left a long time ago, fuck it where I’ma go?
A brother back in the house couldn’t let Obama go
Do it cause you love it nigga, advice from my momma go
Those that just follow green, be the first kind to go
Being broke ain’t a joke, I’m too comical
Seven digits nigga, 2 commas ho
Make your first million and don’t make it your last
Don’t come if you ain’t ready, don’t try to make it too fast
You can’t learn shit, if you never make it to class
You can’t just recycle what should be placed in the trash
I started wanted more money, and a Stacey dash
A car that cost a house and a place to crash
Pull the hammer like a camera; you don’t wanna face the flash
Cause you’ll lose one of your sons and it’s no replacing Nash
Bet the faces you show be the same faces you stash
There’s more where that came from, y'all know where I came from
It’s all about that boy that call me papi
So I’m a keep making that paper copy
You squares could never stop me, that triangles to play me
Two lines for you fuck boys, now pause that, play me
Right from where I left off that, let’s get back to that real shit
That sit back just chill shit. With packs of that kill shit
I chit chat bout trill shit, spit that hot feel shit
I give you four bars it’ll be a Kit Kat of some real shit
Who fucking with me? I mean besides your bitch
I Deebo your ho, you niggas should hide your bitch
Like the chain red’s grandmomma gave him
I got a thing for women, I like them misbehaving
You know like bad, mike bad
So I’ma check’em when I see’em Nik(e) AD
Cause in this life things come and go like fast
And I’m not one who favors using words like had
I’m into having shit, turning dreams to average shit
Bring your trophy to the club, Dallas Maverick shit
Niceeee
I came from first of the month money
To waking up whenever I want money
Niceee
I chase paper, I hunt money
Make 50 racks at 3pm and call it lunch money
Niceeee
Nigga ya stunt money is blunt money
Your boo only got a text back once from me
And that was “What the fuck you want from me?”
But I know what the fuck she want from me, yeah

[Bridge]
You ain’t gotta front for me
I know, I know what you want from me
I know, I know we all want the money
It’s only right we getting to it
Question I come to you with is...

[Hook x8]Smoke a doob, feelin CL Smooth
Watch full of Pete Rocks and she see no crew
Money spent, watch me reminisce over you
Abion flow, get hit with the bird flew
Cop it, new beat I'ma rock it
Kanye on your own shit, like Affion Crockett
Hoes go pop it, pussy sales, bitch get the profit
Now split it with me, evidently
On my team and haters gon' hate me
For whatever I sing but remain unseen
Like the heat in my jeans
Paint a picture so vivid niggas could live in my dream
Wait on the beam cause you can't go bitchy when you talkin' 'bout ki's
Fuck waitin' get cheese, put that on a G
Ballin' now, but just keep it low-key
Niggas know me, smoke weed, hella hoes on the team
Different chick if I wanna have a fling
I'm gettin' all this P for my niggas in the bing
Live vicariously through me
I'm cursed to the death like the one Bruce Lee
But I'm flyer than a crow, you gon' have to shoot me
Hit the gas on the ave. in the slab movin' bags
Take a drag, then I laugh
Success will make 'em mad
And jealousy's a trait for fags
You must got a boot loaded, so close your ass, bitch
Shouts to all my folks and the cash gets
Love 'em forever my nigga, this Cashis
Niggas know me from Uni, with the mothafuckin' tooly
Sophisticated, girls'll turn groupie for a nigga with the hoopty
Keep 'em in my zone like a 2-3
A biscuit and a two-piece, pimp
Cadilac roll on the strip
Bury me in this bitch like I'm Willy the Wimp
If there's something you don't get, nigga study the shit
Or live your life as a dumb fucked son of a bitch
Wayne got these dudes Bloods till they run into Crips
And they ain't tryna hear rap shit, they 600 with it
Two B's, one G forever
Like the gay Cub, Bradley
I tried to leave the street but a nigga gotta eat
Keep my fam straight, my only choice is to G
I'm livin' that thug life, y'all know the rules "gotta do what you gotta do"
Stay true, steady send the prayers to Jesus
Thinkin' forwards, aim juice, I pay dues
And get paid the same move
A real nigga, drinkin' Henny straight
Fuck the chase I'ma take it to the face
On a highspeed chase if the cops wanna chase
Get winded, still ended
Fuck it, so spliffed it
Fuck with it, puffin' to a bucket to a Benz
Chillin' with my friends now a nigga countin' ends
Big face hundreds, big face fifties
Come spend with me
I'm talkin' big face hundreds, big face fifties
Nigga come spend with me[Intro: Wrekonize]
She said some crazy shit and I was like, you're a freak
Ha, freak, you heard me? You're a freak!

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
And I truly wanna come and see what make you tick
Thick hips and a pierced lip, let me dip quick
Shit, get this dick I'm gonna give
My mind, that's one hell of a grip
For a woman looking semi-innocent
You been waiting for the minute you could live
And get me all up in your liver and your ribs
This is not for the women talking bout a little romance
I mean the women not afraid to get both hands
Close and, down on a grown man
She got toys and the wax
All down to her back and her outfit - latex
But it's feeling quite dangerous
This ain't never really felt like safe sex
But we do it anyway, with a bit of Henny
Get a medic ready for the play, you're an outcast
I'm Vinny on the case
Would never diss on a Marisa Tomei
Get down, like I know you wanna wrassle
I'm livin' out my life never bashful
Give it to me with the lace and the tassles
And let 'em hate, tight lippin' assholes
Give me a safe word, it's picnic
Tie you up and give me the jailbird, my hitlist
Needs you to get this, sick shit
Right up from the gutter bring another for the L-word
Take a breath, and I'm gonna accept
Your best bet is to blow my mind
Could put your back out, but I'm sick of that route
I'mma have you tryin' to get up with a broken spine

[Hook: Wrekonize]
And everywhere that we go
You're never fittin' in with all the regular folks
You're a freak, you're a freak, you're a
You got your bad habits, but I ain't mad at it
Some people don't feel right being that average
You're a freak, you're a freak, you're a
You're a freak

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hella pale like Twilight, had to get her up
Into my room and give her my bite
When the sky's bright, she never deny pipe
But we get really horny lovin' and fly by night
She so like a freakshow, other people
Speak no, peace show full of ego
She so, like a d-bro, with her V though
That'll have a nigga weak in the P, bro
Everywhere we go people spot us
They yelling (You're a freak)
But I love it, she's beautiful
Rough and rugged, you're a keep
And when I put it up inside of her
She say to me (You're a freak)
Cause when I'm bangin' inside her ways
I'll be in it balls deep
If you want this thing and
You ain't trippin' that, you bloody (You're a freak)
If you like to put yourself
Where she be muddy, you're a creep
If you want me to stick it between your boobies
When you're lickin' it (You're a freak)
If you want me to be normal
Stiff and formal, then you're a geek
Invite them all, and I pipe with all, of my might
I'mma be a fright to y'all, cause I bite the broads
And I knife them all in my sight
Never be ordinary, stick the more the merry
Go that far, we stay cray
Everyone look at you stupid
When you're an F-R-E-A-K

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Fuck, fuck, fuck yeah she is
She brought her heart and her head she give
She like a dick sucka, yes but a specialist
She deepthroatin' dick like it was effortless
You come around and the fuckin' is a definite
She like “Hehe! Everybody say I’m freaky!“
She let me run a train on her, give her DP
I made it rain on her had her drinkin' peepee
Suckin' on my pinky, and I just hit her with the shocker
Two in the pink one in the stink
Now I gotcha, turn the girl out when I hit it
‘Cause she said I get her off more
She ain’t into soft-core
Fuck around the car port
On the backyard floor
Shit to giggles was nothing let me
See how freaky that you are
Pour the liquor on her titty
Lick it off, smoke a cigarette
I bet she gon’ be ready for an encore
Type of freak I applaude for
Even worst when I'm on the pill I
Gave the bitch a dirty sanchez
She jerk my damn dick
Had her face looking' like a bukkake film
And I don’t care if there’s hair
Or the twat is trim
Meatcurtains are my dinner roll
I'ma hit a ho
Hook on my fishing pole
She got me swimming in the pussy
Like I’m under the olympic gold
I was a freak when I was six years old
My first grade teacher had a nice set of freckled tits
I couldn’t wait for the day I was old enough
To bust a nut, givin' girls pearl necklaces
And you a sexy bitch, an exhibitionist
So when I hit it, I'ma break a bitch in half
Face fine as hell, pussy tight as fuck
But she'd still rather take it in the ass
She a motherfuckin' freak[Hook]
Free
It's goin' down, d-d-down, it's goin' down
Free
It's goin' down, d-d-down, it's goin' down
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
Free

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Straight outta cell 12 a hell fell on my lap
A nigga was born to rap 'bout drug tales and all the rats
This is for Chef Jr., now that's Italiana
Chicken Parmesan and bocce with my paesanas
I told my [?] I'll die with my honor paesana
Six bad bitches, some marijuana, with [?]
If you could see the pictures and the scriptures that these bitches sent me
Hopped in the Ghost, my wiz jumped in the sister Bentley
When Suge had the Row, Jay start the Roc
I was in the [?] fuck the cops
With the killer cross, had Iverson on the block
Graced the cover of The Source, tell me that ain't hot
Went in for RICO, kilos, wish they gave me the max
Fuck them C.O.'s, and C. Ho's for hatin' on crack
Four months on the toilet shit, I can do that
Came with thirty, left with three, now how the fuck he do that?
Most these niggas in the Fed shoulda been in the State
[?] the Texas to Brazil, now we raisin' the stakes
I seen Gordouli, know that nigga big like Chapo
Shout out to you know who, let me fuck in the chapel
[?], first thing in the mornin'
Tried to send me to the shoe for the first pair of Jordans
I had a thing for the secretary, wassup Ms. Jordan?
All that ass in them pants had you feelin' important
Left with J's on my feet, J's, J's on my feet
Straight out the cage, sun raised on the beach
And I ain't got to lie, my son raised on the beach
Crib with the elevator, Gabe on the piece

[Hook: Raekwon]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Gun tote, move dope, niggas know my repertoire
Bulletproof smart car, level six AR
Cocktail, Molotov, burn heat, turn heat
Revolve, cock, bang, revolve, it's off
Cocaine, medating, codeine better lean
The fuck out my way, drive the bricks down the highway
Its an anthem when I rant, fuck you think I am, Kanye?
I had them wearing vests, now these niggas wear dresses
I take you back to the essence, free of charge a nigga so large, these niggas is stressin', I bless 'em
The pounds the purple with profits precise
With precision, we'll move you up the pillar, you get that right
Money motivation, this bread in the basket
Go ahead, say something 'bout it while you gettin' your ass kicked
Niggas back on the New York bullshit
My little man post up in the bank with a full clip, he let it off

[Hook: Raekwon]

[Outro: Barbra Streisand]
Free again
Back to bein' free again
Back to bein' me again
With all my precious freedom
My precious, precious freedom[Intro]
God will never put you in a situation that you can't handle
But you can definitely put yourself in a situation you can't handle
And some situations lead to death
Death is a mothafucker...ya dig?

[Verse 1]
Old timer want the block back, stop that
"You been gone too long", the young nigga said
Lord knows, whats going through this young nigga's head
As the old timer stood and grilled him
Peeled off, shorty looked at his man
Touched his burner like "I should've killed him"
Shorty in deep, but he don't care
But he don't know, these old timers don't play fair(Nah)
There he go, postin' on his strip again
Toast on him, niggas with him, posted on his shit again
(Uh-Oh) He acting like it can't and it won't happen
Old Timer 'bout to blow dust off that old cabinet
(Dust,Dust,Dust...) Where them guns is kept
These young niggas better show some respect (respect)
"I'll teach 'em a lesson", he said to his self
As he proceeded to pull the lead from his shelf
Now he headed towards Shorty block, forty cocked
On his zip, on his shit, like he don't care who Shorty wit
But somebody saw him, before he got to Shorty
Shorty phone ring, somebody called him
Somebody warned him, "He's coming, he's coming!"
Shorty replied, "Somebody stall him!"
Then he crept up wit his goons and guns
Whispered in the Old Timer's ear, death's soon to come

[Hook]
They say hell is hot
Well, is heaven cold?
Know one ever knows til you Gone, gone, gone
And when you gone does your soul drift off to a better place
Or do you just forever fade
Away,away,away,away...like a bird when it's headed towards the sky, huh?
Or do you just die, huh?
Or do you just perish from the earth and if so, why?

[Verse 2]
Baddest bitch up on the block
Probably make a nigga cum as soon as she get up on the cock
She fuck with Tony don't she? (don't she)
Oh he's, not your average drug dealer, fa sho he's
Being watched by police, feds
Investigators, oh--can't forget the haters
Homegirl ain't got a clue what he do for a living
She just think she got a dude with a pension
She don't know this dude is a henchman
And he moves on dudes with the cruelest intentions
All she know she got a brand new Benz
And it's big enough for her and all her brand new friends (Damn)
There she go, all through the street with it
Dude in and outta town, she all through the street with it
We all know the street talk, we all know the street listen
Next day, she's missing....
(music stops, phone rings twice)
(man speaks)"Hello?"
(man on phone)"Hey nigga, I got yo bitch. Have a million sent up or she dead!"
(music resumes)
Damn--she in deep shit, and she did nothing!
I bet you she ain't see this coming, but he did
Cause he did nothing, he ain't pay (pay)
He told 'em keep that bitch, he okay
He got a wife and a kid, back home
And he don't care about the life that she live (Damn)
Now that's wrong (wrong)
But the story ain't over it drags on (aw man what happened next?)
They wind up beating her down
Breathless, he winds up fleeing the town, to the next bitch...

[Hook]

[Juelz]
And um, I say that to say this, a lot of people don't appreciate life until they're gone
I mean, a lot of situations can be avoided, you just gotta avoid 'em, ya dig?
These are just a few stories, man...there's a lot more where they come from
Just don't be one of them people I'm talking bout, ya know....[Intro]
I hate gossip
And I don't walk around lookin' for it, you know?
But, yesterday it seemed to just wander around 'til it found me
You know like, the gossip found me
Then why don't try provin' it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well, what you just do is, stop

[Verse 1]
Stop, hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion, the lady of a nigga
And you could get tipped like you're waitin' on a nigga
Put a body bag and an apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you could never see if you sit behind the light
And you don't have to pick me to win the title fight
But I'mma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is Snow White
I'm tryna be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fuckin' po-lice
And my flow is rare, these other rappers nice
These other rappers bark, some of 'em even bite
But I'm much more bright, I give the game sight
So before you dim the light you just might, might wanna

[Refrain]
Think it over , think it over
Ooooh, think it over
Think it over, baby baby
(Get 'em)

[Verse 2]
Stop, analyzing, criticizing
You should realize what I am and start epitomizing
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion
I'm confident like fuck 'em all, pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city, cause my city's crying
Because my city's dying
Still I emerge from all of that, I am a living pioneer near Zion
Fear God not them
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the boot
And soo-woo, and then I leave a tub in the booth, I leave a bloodbath
Sorry there's a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe, no, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the string on a boot, now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I must ask

[Refrain 2]
Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

[Verse 3]
Drag my name through the mud, I come out clean
Cast away stones, I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem, I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gone need cheese if I'm bakin' the ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica, where weed be
Hard body nigga, just takin' it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers, why do rappers, lie to fans, lie to rappers
Lotta rappers, lie like actors, cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga fuck your props
And make it out to Mr. Hip-Hop
I'm not dead, I'm alive[Produced by Infamous and StreetRunner]

[Lil Wayne]
Back the hell off!
Rock and roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherfuckers somethin to feel on
Rollin like a motherfucker put your wheels on
And let's roll down the hill 'til the hill gone
I started on the block but that's somethin to build on
And how can I pray when I got nuttin to kneel on?

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

[Lil Wayne]
Huh, walk on air
Show me to the edge and I walk off there
We ain't high enough, au contraire
And sometimes life just don't compare
Sa-say my name, baby pull my hair
And I'mma fuck you like a bull, I swear
I got a lot of love that I could just share
I got a lot of drugs that I could just share!!
I-I-I know, I know, what'chu like girl
A nice little mirror and a little white girl
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing
May I be everything but grounded
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float... {*echoes*}

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Jump jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby

[Hook] sans last three words

[Lil Wayne]
I know a girl named Crystal, her last name Ball
I look into her eyes, and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill-kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin what am I, be in spiritual fall
Huh, shit, cause ain't no love
Die while America drink yo' blood
It ain't no hurricane, it ain't no flood
It's some other shit that we ain't know of
Make that money yeah make that money
Then watch the government take that money
But we gon' raise hell motherfucker get well
Laws get passed and economies fail
Love, hate, emotion, compulsion
Addiction, diction, virgins, dickses
Minglin, mixin, swingin, switchin
Swaggin, sweet, freaks, faggots
Flames, fashion, planes, crashin
Ground, zero...

[Outro]
Let's let's let's jump off a buildin baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a buildin babyyy {*slows to a stop*}
