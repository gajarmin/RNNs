Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades

Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
On down through the Middle Ages
When the earth kept going through changes
There's a business going on, cars continue to change
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne
Like Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades

Hand clap, hand clap, the renegades

From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical message to help the others listen
Improve momentum and seek the electonic chance
Like astrology
Like technology
Like God's Creation
Like the Zulu station
Like to the nation
Like destroy all nations
Like militants
Like down in sand
Like through changes ,nothing stays the same
Oh renegades

Now renegades are people with their own philosophy
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
You know they have their secret notions
And time is endless motion
All people of the moderate ages here in this twentieth century
You have to keep up in time with the moderate time
A state of mind and a sense of pride
A renegade, yes a renegade
Of this time and age
So many renegades
Who's that
Now hand clap
The renegades

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
You know we're poppin', sockin', with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
(Repeat)

We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of
Electronics
With the bass, and the treble
The horns and our vocals
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh

There was a time when our music
Was something called the Bay Street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down on the Bay sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor
Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force
We're talking about Mr. B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E
Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age
So many renegades
What's that
It's a hand clap
The renegade

Just jam sucker
Say jam sucker
Say groove, sucker
Say groove, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Now move, sucker
Now move, sucker

Everybody say
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

Shake that thing
That makes me swing
I got some great
He's a renegade of funk
Mr. Biggs
He's a renegade of funk
Bambaataa
He's a renegade of funk
Pow Wow
He's a renegade of funk

Inferior, filthy bacteria
Queens shit I rep that, so expect that
If I ain't got a yankee then I probably got a met hat
Laundry mat trap let the tek clap respect that
Bleeding from the back of your head I call you wet back
Cigarette face with the ashy elbows
They ain't find his body they found his shell toes
They ain't find his body they found the nigga scarf
His dam dna was all over the park.. b'cuz..

[Hook]

[Iman T.H.U.G]
Yo yo..

Check it yo yo yo

Check it check it yo yo yooo
Check it check it yo yo yo
Yea yeaI don't dig a lot of the establishment
Well, your ideas and values
They may work for you but
They don't all work for me
As far as I'm concerned
Some are with it
And well some aren't

Hmm, that's a hard one to say
It's hard to say, I'd say
Well wash your ass every day
Wash your whole body every day
And brush your breath at least 2 or 3 times a day
With your teeth, and then you know, wash the face

Do any of these things prevent venereal disease, besides the rubbers?

Carry some of your herbal or salt or pepper around in your pocket
Stuff, it opens up in your pocket and gets mixed up with your lint cotton
Or mess with the flavour cause when you take the herb and put it in your mouth
Then you gonna be eatin' somethin' then you got little strings of lint pullin' on your teeth
So you just take it out and use the string for flossin'

That's... that's far out
What do you feel is the best way to
To keep from getting a, a chick pregnant?
I mean..., what do you do?

Well, you need different pairs of socks
You know, some times you need the coloured socks
That's if you're gonna wear one pair of socks to hide your dirt
Then every, every, every other couple of days I mean, you wear the white sock
You can wear them probably 1 or 2 days
Until you try to walk aroun' an' they get caught in the carpet
Then the dirt used up from the carpet gets up into your sock
Then you get the little black spots on the side
Or you can go and get, you know, the different types
There's other types of socks that's made for shoes
But then they get funky and your feet start sweatin' and stuff
Or you can get sweat socks that grab the sweat so they won't be funking
And you get the powder into put it in so you won't get the funk or the funky feet
Or that little feet and the stink is you have to be the funk
Cuz when you die you go back to the funk
And if you got sock funk you got to be funky cause it stinkin
Or something ran up in your ass and just diedHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey........

We got to understand rap been here for a long time~!
When God talked to the prophets, he was rappin
And when the prophets talked back to God, they was rappin
And then if people wanna bring it up and get all up to the modern days and ages
We can start to goin in the 60's when you had Shirley Ellis
When she did "The Name Game" and "The Clapping Song"
We can go to the poetry rappin of of sister Son.. Sonia Sanchez
With uh The Watts Poets, or The Last Poets
We can get into the political or the message rap
Of The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan, Malcolm X
Or The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
We can get into the the the the party and fun raps
Of Pigby Markam{?}, Marks Baby{?}
We can go back to the "Hi De Hi De Ho" with Cab Calloway
We can go back to the radio disc jockey or jocko
Eddie OJ, and all the others that did things
We can go back to the LOVE RAP of Isaac Hayes, Black Moses
To the LOVE RAP of Barry White out there
This is all part of rap
And if all you country people want to get into the country & western thing
We can take it to, Tony Joe White, when he did "Poke Salad Annie"
This is all dealin with the rap
Rap has always been there... {*echoes*}No matter how hard you try, you can't stop this now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop this now

Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades

Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
On down through the Middle Ages
When the earth kept going through changes
There's a business going on, cars continue to change
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne
Like Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades

Hand clap, hand clap, the renegades

From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical message to help the others listen
Improve momentum and seek the electonic chance
Like astrology
Like technology
Like God's Creation
Like the Zulu station
Like to the nation
Like destroy all nations
Like militants
Like down in sand
Like through changes ,nothing stays the same
Oh renegades

Now renegades are people with their own philosophy
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
You know they have their secret notions
And time is endless motion
All people of the moderate ages here in this twentieth century
You have to keep up in time with the moderate time
A state of mind and a sense of pride
A renegade, yes a renegade
Of this time and age
So many renegades
Who's that
Now hand clap
The renegades

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
You know we're poppin', sockin', with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
(Repeat)

We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of
Electronics
With the bass, and the treble
The horns and our vocals
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh

There was a time when our music
Was something called the Bay Street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down on the Bay sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor
Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force
We're talking about Mr. B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E
Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age
So many renegades
What's that
It's a hand clap
The renegade

Just jam sucker
Say jam sucker
Say groove, sucker
Say groove, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Now move, sucker
Now move, sucker

Everybody say
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

Speak about destruction (x3)

[Hook: John Lydon & Afrika Bambaataa]
This is a world destruction, your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
Countries are fighting with chemical warfare

[Verse 1:Afrika Bambaataa]
Not giving a damn about the people who live
Nostradamus predicts the coming of the Antichrist
Hey, look out, the third world nations are on the rise
The Democratic-Communist Relationship
Won't stand in the way of the Islamic force
The CIA is looking forother tactics
The KGB is smarter than you think
Brainwash mentalities to control the system
Using TV and movies - religions of course

[Pre-Hook: John Lydon & Afrika Bambaataa]
Yes, the world is headed for destruction
Is it a nuclear war?
What are you asking for?

[Hook: John Lydon]
This is a world destruction
Your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
The rich get richer
The poor are getting poorer
Fascist, chauvinistic government fools

[Verse 2: Afrika Bambaataa]
People, Moslems, Christians and Hindus
Are in a time zone just searching for the truth
Who are you to think you're a superior race?
Facing forth your everlasting doom

[Pre-Hook: John Lydon & Afrika Bambaataa]
We are Time Zone
We've come to drop a bomb on you
World destruction, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom!

[Hook: John Lydon & Afrika Bambaataa]
This is the world destruction, your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
Nationalities are fighting with each other
Why is this? Because the system tells you


[Verse 3: Afrika Bambaataa]
Putting people in racist categories
Knowledge isn't what it used to be
Military tactics to control a nation
Who wants to be a president or king? Me!
Mother Nature is gonna work against you
Nothing in your power that you can do
Yes, the world is headed for destruction
You and I know it, cause the Bible tells you
If we don't start to look for a better life
The world will be destroyed in a time zone!

[Outro: Afrika Bambaataa]
Speak about destruction (x3){*over beat from "Phucked"*}

[Afrika Bambaataa]
True school, you got to stop BS'in, with this
New school you got to stop BS'in with this
Cause y'all don't know that y'all ALL are bein controlled by corporations
Where's your hip-hop museum? Where's your hip-hop doctors?
Where's your hip-hop judges? Hip-Hop lawyers?
Where's our hip-hop agriculturalists? Our hip-hop army?
We better have some hip-hop police police our hip-hop self
If we gon' do all this killin
We are at war brothers and sisters...
{*leads into "Everybody Rise"*}I don't dig a lot of the establishment
Well, your ideas and values
They may work for you but
They don't all work for me
As far as I'm concerned
Some are with it
And well some aren't

Hmm, that's a hard one to say
It's hard to say, I'd say
Well wash your ass every day
Wash your whole body every day
And brush your breath at least 2 or 3 times a day
With your teeth, and then you know, wash the face

Do any of these things prevent venereal disease, besides the rubbers?

Carry some of your herbal or salt or pepper around in your pocket
Stuff, it opens up in your pocket and gets mixed up with your lint cotton
Or mess with the flavour cause when you take the herb and put it in your mouth
Then you gonna be eatin' somethin' then you got little strings of lint pullin' on your teeth
So you just take it out and use the string for flossin'

That's... that's far out
What do you feel is the best way to
To keep from getting a, a chick pregnant?
I mean..., what do you do?

Well, you need different pairs of socks
You know, some times you need the coloured socks
That's if you're gonna wear one pair of socks to hide your dirt
Then every, every, every other couple of days I mean, you wear the white sock
You can wear them probably 1 or 2 days
Until you try to walk aroun' an' they get caught in the carpet
Then the dirt used up from the carpet gets up into your sock
Then you get the little black spots on the side
Or you can go and get, you know, the different types
There's other types of socks that's made for shoes
But then they get funky and your feet start sweatin' and stuff
Or you can get sweat socks that grab the sweat so they won't be funking
And you get the powder into put it in so you won't get the funk or the funky feet
Or that little feet and the stink is you have to be the funk
Cuz when you die you go back to the funk
And if you got sock funk you got to be funky cause it stinkin
Or something ran up in your ass and just diedRead the press release at Official press release  -or-International Hip Hop Parade[Afrika Bambaataa]

And we dedicate it to the people we know
We're one of a kind, we're easin the mind
The Zulu Nation say time after time

To the party people out there, we want y'all just to know

Aha, at every Zulu Throwdown, say this is what you see

We rock in the sunlight or any kind of weather
Cause we are the Force (everybody) that has our act together
We wanna party (party) dance (dance) and boogie all damn night

While the people at the door are just standin in one big line
Do-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do
Now some of our voices are high, some are low
Do-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do
But it don't make no difference, we can still all yell "ho!"
Do-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do
Well, the song is almost over, and emceein is an art

So check out the way we introduce ourselves

She's...
Lisa Lee, and from the top of the key
You know I'm guaranteed to be the queen of MC's
He's...
MC Chubby Chub from the heavens above
No, I ain't never met a girl that I couldn'd shook up
And he's...
MC Ice-Ice, the shocker-rocker on the mic
And doin it on, doin it high power, doin it right
And he's...
Little Ikey C, and I'm the melody
Now all you young ladies get sexy
Do it

This is a story from the yesteryear
Said before it was the wack, but now the ladies cheer
Until we climb the ladder say one by one
And while we did it, we spreaded some fun
Say we change the tempo so you can clap your hands
And then we add a little ( ? ) so y'all can dance
And you like our style, which is just our voice
So young ladies, come and pick your choice
Chubby Chub
Ice-Ice
I'm Little Ikey C
We are the three MC's
Lisa Lee
You're the queen
Go girl
Just get on the mic and do your own thing

[Lisa Lee]
So put your hands in the air and listen to me
Cause you listen to the voice of MC Lisa Lee
Don't play no games, don't bite no style
When you came through the door we gave you a smile
We want you to get loose, get ready to rock
We're gonna paralyze your mind and put you in shock
We're gonna make you wanna yell, scream and shout
We're gonna let you know without a doubt
Exactly what we be about
Rockin to the sounds that make you dance
Make the ants crawl in your pants
Put you in a music trance
Listen to the beat and let yourself go
Cause everybody knows this is nothin but a disco
Rock, shock the sure shot
This ain't a Broadway play or a high school plot
It's the real deal that makes you feel
Like, like you got sex appeal
Now party people in the place you feel the bass
Can you check out the highs, check out the grace
So wallflowers in the house, this is your chance
To show everybody that you can dance
Punk rock to the left, and Patty Duke to the right
Move your body now, you can do it all night
These are the devastating words that you never heard before
I'm Lisa Lee, hah, I got rhymes galore
So young ladies out there, he's from the heavens above

[Chubby Chub]
That's right, never met a girl that I couldn't shook up
So won't you clap your hands and have some fun
It's the super dynamite (huh) MC Chubby Chub
You don't stop (hah) you don't stop (haha)
Get it all together, girl, because we're startin to rock
And to all the young ladies, yes his name is Chub
Say I didn't come here to ask for your love
Cause I'm a cool, cool kid with a healthy mind
And I figure that ( ? ) will always take time
I'm lookin for a girl that I can call mine
When she walk down the street, the sun will shine
And to all the young ladies, I'm talkin 'bout me
Cause I'm lookin for a girl that's so unique
I'm not lookin for a girl that drives a car
To me she'll always be my superstar
Cause I'm lookin for a girl with a beautiful smile
And a young lady that's worth my while
Young ladies out there, don't you get uptight

[Ice-Ice]
Cause it's me, baby doll, MC Ice-Ice
Just like a bike got wheels, sweet lemon peel
Now the MC's, they know the deal
That we always rock and we can't be stopped
Wherever we rock and hit the latest spot
I said the other MC's are standin tall
But the taller they are, the harder they fall
Cause we the, the Funkadelic on the microphone
Because we are the MC's that's all alone
And when we get on the mic it's back to back
I said that we're the crew that leads the pack
And we'll teach ya lessons that you'll never forget
Because we are the MC's that ( ? )
We're on to the crack of dawn
We're on to the crack of dawn
And young ladies, he's from the top

[Little Ikey C]
(He's) Little Ikey C and I'm the master rock
Ya don't stop, ya don't stop
Told you 'bout the ding-da-da-ding-da-ding-dingy-ding
That thing that you call that body rock
Now let me tell you somethin that caught my eye
It was a real jazzy lady, she was so fly
She had long hair and clothes so fine
I said, "I'ma keep rappin until you're mine"
I said, "I'ma rap for just about a hour"
Cause I knew the young lady was surely high power
And the way she moved was like a graceful swan
And we can make love to the break of dawn
And the way she move is like a graceful dove
Say could it be I'm fallin in love
"Will you be mine" is what I say
Why don't you chill out, just gimme the play
Ya don't stop
Ya don't stop
