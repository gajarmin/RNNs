[Verse 1]
My sister, my sister, tell me what the trouble is
I'll try to listen good and give the best advice that I can give
So, what's up with you this time?
Your honey took a dive and now he's playin with your mind?
Oh no, this can not be accepted
The feelings that belong to you must be protected
Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat 2X)

[Verse 2]
Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
There's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know
It's time for you to show you're not sleepin
A progress report on the two of you, you're keepin
Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin
You estimated right, that night the other weekend
Collectively the facts should conclude the decision
You caught the brother in a terrible disposition

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat 2X)

[Verses 3]
That's it, pack it up, be wise my sister
Cause the facts keep stackin up, tell him, to kiss the you know what
Make sure the door is shut, behind you
I do believe the brother's out of luck, and stuck
But that's not, your P-R-O-B-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dum dum and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
And you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
Of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same
And it's a cryin shame

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat til fade)[Queen Latifah]
The ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you, break you, take you
Now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream

[Monie Love]
Ayo, let me take it from here, Queen...
Excuse me but I think I'm about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)

(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)

[Monie Love]
Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not for being one but for being with one
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First

[Queen Latifah]
I break into a lyrical freestyle
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
(With what?) With a little touch of "Ladies First"

Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen

[Monie Love]
My sister, can I get some?

[Queen Latifah]
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb

[Monie Lovie]
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American
You dig exactly where I'm coming from
You want righteous rhyming, I'mma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another
Plus one more; all four
Have a job to do, we doing it
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E

[Queen Latifah]
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax
When I get there, that's when I tax
The next man, or the next woman
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming
And I'll recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is "Ladies First"

Step out into the night
Queens of civilization are on the mic
The scene is right, the crowd is hype
I expel the wack and those who bite
Why, cause I'm that type
Swaying with beats 45 King style
He wants me to sing but I swing, so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic, I rocked it next
Plex, you never catch me at my worst
You get the drift? It's Ladies FirstBrother what is with you, you can't take a hint?
I need to shove a splint between your eyes for you to see
You and me were never meant to be
Your homeboy likes me, I like him too, get out the picture
I get your point but I'm not rolling with the punch
I scrunched up the letter you wrote me in lunch
In 5th period I pay no notice to your motion
My work is on the table, my pen's in locomotion
Every time I turn around, you're looking at my face
I try to ignore you, the bell rings, I race out the room
Zoom to another room, sit down, what do you know?
The lover's in town
The other brother (Who?) The one I want to talk to
Sitting three seats back, and I'mma walk over to him
And give him the letter I wrote
Because my feelings towards him are brewing, ya know?

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

In 7th the knucklehead walks in and sits down beside me
I said "Yo, why you trying to ride me?"
Day in and day out I can't seem to get you off my back
What do you think I should do about that?
In fact it's embarrassing, what a buffoon
You even follow me in the ladies bathroom
Give me a break, I can't take it, the stakes are too high
Besides, there goes the other brother
I'm not Keith Sweat, so don't sweat me
The other brother's smooth approach is what gets me
He intrigues the Mon you know
So I suggest the course towards me you blow
You're wasting time pursuing Monie
Cause she's pursuing the lover only
And as my mother did she told me
Go for what you know, Mo, yo

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

Bringing matters to a close and everybody knows
That I'm no longer in the middle
I made my decision, precisely, precision is a must
For me to solve another riddle
Step into a brand new rhythm,-ism schisms
Nope, I'm not with 'em, I've given
My undivided attention, you know what I'm saying?
No type of games I'm playing when

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 4x)Full term love (2x)

[Verse 1]
To be or not to be that is the question
Brothers be hawking sisters sometime with no intention
Of tryna get serious, I mean make a commitment
Come on honey insecurity flows in by the shipment
Pardon the expression but are you already taken
I live around the way boy so don't be tryna fake
And if you wanna know me better I suggest you follow
Cause I ain't tryna start up nothing destined to be hollow
You say you understand good no need for me to wonder
Wanna be my man alright well here's my name and number
But if you're not sure you better stop look listen and
Learn because I'm looking for a love that will last full term

Full term love (4x)

[Verse 2]
OK we're on a date you wanna take me to movies
Dinner and dancing and after that a little room please
No I'm not the one so the thought you can delete
Because it's very tracky and it's only been a week
Now you wanna hit the sheets (no) don't really think so
Make it all complete (no) I don't really think so
Wanna be fast then before you even blink I'll be talking to another
(Where'd) you meet him at the rink oh
Speedy Gonzalez you better slow down
Because I'm levelheaded with my feet on the ground
Why don't you try and do something constructive for instance
Committing to a love that will last the full distance

Full term love (8x)

[Verse 3]
You wonder why you see me at the bus stop everyday
It's because I have a job so there's nothing no one can say
Don't try to treat me like a stepchild with ring around the collar
Or even a pest because I don't want your dollars
It's simply just a cool thing called love and understanding
A little sincerity and that's all that I'm demanding
A brother who can say "honey your wish is my command"
And if you can't get it then I'll leave you where you're standing
I'm tryna get something that's mo' better
You see an easy around the way go sweat her
I'm telling you now without being undercover
That I might be an around the way girl
But I'm a full term lover brother

Full term love (8x)[Verse 1]
Who ever said that you couldn't succeed
When your heart bleeds you need on your knees and you begging please
And if it ever came your way it be a better day
And if it don't, don't give up hope and continue to pray
I know I've had my fair share of despair honey
I wouldn't give up on the mere thought of mo' money
So this is what I did I forbid
The attitude that'll get ya
Suckered out of a picture
I never saw myself as some kinda hero
So listen up because your time could be near yo
Quitters never win winners never quit
If you don't believe in yourself nobody else will do it

[Verse 2]
The very young can be blinded
Thinking what they find is an easy way out
It's road that escapes the clout
Well think again because there's prices on another level
A faster route and now your foot is layin' on the pedal
When did your heart decide that you could just settle for less
Don't you know in your category you were truly blessed
I think you suffered a severe loss of self-esteem
And now it seems your whole life is a movie scene
You're still a rompa you can change if you really wanna
Double back recollect when you turned the wrong corner
Don't be content until you meet your demands
You can do it blood you can be a much better man

[Verse 3]
I had some lucky circumstances but I had to work
Amidst the possibility of maybe gettin' jerked
But I'm here ain't I and I'm in the mix too
That demonstrates how much a strong heart and mind can do
So please don't become a victim of pessimism
Keep your goals to yourself nobody messing with 'em
Keep your mind straight from those who wanna dictate
The spam of your intelligence they seem to underrate
It's a form of oppression that they demonstrate
And nine times out of ten they're guarded by a false plate
Never give up individual dreams
Of your future state and determine your own fate

[Verse 4]
Suckas that speak on a tracky technique
Choose to preach on a sub-level spewing evil of the devil
You gotta check it disconnect it to the minimal
Speaking tongues under drums like a subliminal
Figure that you gotta kiss before you kick
And every trick will then stick without licks you it's over dick
You didn't touch me then you don' t touch me now
Believing in the power of myself, I know how[Maceo]
Me, Plug Three, the one they call Baby Huey
The one that gets all the buddy (all the buddy)
Yeah, that's right

[Dove]
A fat funky fruit with a whole lot of tang
A little something called "Doing Our Own Thang"
Breaking the beat others wished they broke
Bassline so dope that you just might choke
Don't bite off something that you can't chew
And don't trail behind when I'm coming through
Fronting the feel that you really can't feel
Cause you're trying to feel what's on my reel to reel

[Q-Tip]
A tree is growing
Can't you see what I see? A white blue fruit to boot
We count to ten before we pass the crews, now that's family
Equipped with the brothers and the sisters and the sisters and the brothers
And all others, with the funky flairs, the bugged-out hairs
It's the life of Riley, I'm really ready
Gazing at the dollar fill of rap
The cool june bugs, the wicks, the wacks
Praise the rhythms for what it beez
And praise the Lord for the JB's

[Hook]
We're doing our own thang
We're doing our own thang
We're doing our own thang
We're doing our own thang

[Posdnuos]
Isn't it cool when you cut your hair
And the blood is red instead of sellout green
This is not the music for an RnB mind
This is flower intertwined with a vine
(In other words this is rose)
You see what I mean? Or see what Grandpa Bam saw
Funk we transmit is unstable
One condition if I am able to say
(Yes you may) Well hey, let's get on with it
Vocal confetti is thrown, sometimes spitted
Out the vents of hecklers and fans
Either which way they all hop on the van
The band, the band, here comes the band
The tribe of fingers all on one hand
Me, myself, and I are dark
Monie Love the mouthpiece, it's now yours to spark

[Monie Love]
Sister Monie, the only one here who missed a plane back to London
Residing with my brothers and I learned a lot from them
About the group, how to be smooth and play funky
And sometimes rated it's kind of funky, but it's cool
For we are beyond the stereotypes
Coordination crazy, but still it sounds hype
Rocking on and off beat, and I do believe I'm right (You're right)
Am I wrong? (Yeah, son)
Don't be mad, be glad I missed the plane, I'm staying
With the Brothers Jungle, Soul, and the Tribe I'm saying
Funky funky rhymes that always stay in swing
I believe we doing our own thing

[Hook]

[Afrika]
Well my family sets all the trends
From soul to soul, large to loose ends
A&R men sign groups like hell
(Cause that's where the money's at, honey)
Yeah, the industry's filled with copycats
RnB mixed with sloppy raps
Tribes like us always open doors
But what for, so you can get yours?
You ain't in to it, all you want is profit
So I ask you please to stop it
Leave me alone, get off my bone
Cause I'm doing my own...

[Mike G]
A new seed, a new breed
A new menu to feed the greed
A new pair of boots for a new piece of butt
Sweet daddy are you there? (Sammy B is on the cut!)
Spinning back for a rap that's laid back
Ready to kick back, those that get no slack
I may rock a rhyme or I may start to sing
But still, I'm doing my own thing

[Dove]
In comes the mood of Jungle and Daisies
Play the same and let the vibes grace me
All hold hands and let's walk about
And form a circle and talk about
Don't follow the path that we're stepping
Truth to the soul is what I'm cramming
Reasons for this is that the family's strong
And like Bob Marley said "We're jammin"
Seeing is believing, so see and believe
And let the groove of the new proceed
A whole bunch of love, peace signs, and fun
So let's do what's got to be done, you know?If you came tonight, and you feel all gold
Somebody say HOOOOOOOO! (HOOOOOOOOOO!)
HOOOOOOOO! (HOOOOOOOOOO!) And you don't stop
Clap your hands to the beat to the beat just clap to your hands to the beat (everybody just)
Clap your hands to the beat to the beat just clap to your hands to the beat (check it out)

[Monie Love]
Work work work, that's all I ever hear you talkin about
What happened to play some time, all work no play is good for now
You square I do declare become aware come over here
Share this hyper-funky party atmosphere, I think it's fair
To spread your time more evenly than you do, get the clue
Get down do exactly what I'm about to do, is that hard for you?
I didn't think so, so let's go, with the flow, and you know
You can work it out with Sister Mo'

Work it out..
Work work it out..

Are you ready to get into this funky funky funky stuff
I hope that there will be enough, there is no need for me to bluff
Cause what I'm about to do is set the mood just so you get picture
Let the rhythm get fly hitcha I will lead the peoples witcha
Sway a little mo' I know the flow will get you so
Why don'tcha try to let go of your entire ratio
Let the music fill your shoes, take care of all your worldly blues
I'll try my best to do the rest, so whaddya say, ??
So slap you in the face with good intentions
I'm forgettin to mention, Monie Mon's imaginative invention
Bein able to party Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday even Sunday catch my drift? Okay next section
Time to work it out, you got the clout, the ability
To achieve your every need so let me see
You can do what you're doin now, I'll show you how
Let me hear you shout - with Sister Monie we can work it out

Work, work work, work
Work, work work it out..

Howmany howmany howmany times must you make yourself a slave
You'rediggin you'rediggin a grave, get out the corner that you make
Won't you live just a little, get out of the middle
Kill the doubt, with Sister Monie you can work it out

[Rap samples and ad libs to end][Maceo]

Yeah I go Nas, Lord Do It All
Me and you got something in common through Marley Marl

Golden aged flows, you sound undiscovered

Hip Hop's alive, and I'm the breathing dragon
On the stage whylin, jumpin and laughin
It's Lords of the Underground and that's if you're askin!

[Verse 11: Chip Fu from The Fu-Schickens]
Yo! I strip the booth anytime my lips move
And it spews, my screws and they loose, I'm a move and it's proof
Now give me two minutes I'm still wicked and still kickin it
With skills built and hot {?} you can't step in my shoes YO!!
When I'm in the mood, when I'm in the booth and whenever when you
I spit phantom in a boost you better just prepare to make room!
Nas give me eight bars, eight stars Escobar
Yo we rule, and we still ain't got nothin to prove, yo!

[Verse 12: Dres from Black Sheep]
For the second I'm wreckin I got you double-checkin
For me to flash your big chain wheeler, shiny weapon, step in and holla
I gotta hit the kids that shit Hip Hop
The wack gets spit lot, the man bullshit stop
Yo they call lot and I accept the invitation
But I not try and snitch upon my ?inclamation?
On the real God, I'm good, a brother been in mediation
And my mind has been kenotic, kill the pres led a netion, Dres

[Outro: Nas]
Aiyyo Chi Ali hold ya head up in the peniles
This your man Nas, here they are
Unbelievable , Hip Hop is Dead
Let's see what happens aight!!![Queen Latifah]
The ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you, break you, take you
Now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream

[Monie Love]
Ayo, let me take it from here, Queen...
Excuse me but I think I'm about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)

(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)

[Monie Love]
Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not for being one but for being with one
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First

[Queen Latifah]
I break into a lyrical freestyle
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
(With what?) With a little touch of "Ladies First"

Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen

[Monie Love]
My sister, can I get some?

[Queen Latifah]
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb

[Monie Lovie]
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American
You dig exactly where I'm coming from
You want righteous rhyming, I'mma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another
Plus one more; all four
Have a job to do, we doing it
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E

[Queen Latifah]
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax
When I get there, that's when I tax
The next man, or the next woman
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming
And I'll recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is "Ladies First"

Step out into the night
Queens of civilization are on the mic
The scene is right, the crowd is hype
I expel the wack and those who bite
Why, cause I'm that type
Swaying with beats 45 King style
He wants me to sing but I swing, so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic, I rocked it next
Plex, you never catch me at my worst
You get the drift? It's Ladies First* contains a short bonus verse not on the LP version

Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first

He wants me to sing but I swing, so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic, I rocked it next
Plex, you never catch me at my worst
You get the drift? It's Ladies FirstBrother what is with you, you can't take a hint?
I need to shove a splint between your eyes for you to see
You and me were never meant to be
Your homeboy likes me, I like him too, get out the picture
I get your point but I'm not rolling with the punch
I scrunched up the letter you wrote me in lunch
In 5th period I pay no notice to your motion
My work is on the table, my pen's in locomotion
Every time I turn around, you're looking at my face
I try to ignore you, the bell rings, I race out the room
Zoom to another room, sit down, what do you know?
The lover's in town
The other brother (Who?) The one I want to talk to
Sitting three seats back, and I'mma walk over to him
And give him the letter I wrote
Because my feelings towards him are brewing, ya know?

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

In 7th the knucklehead walks in and sits down beside me
I said "Yo, why you trying to ride me?"
Day in and day out I can't seem to get you off my back
What do you think I should do about that?
In fact it's embarrassing, what a buffoon
You even follow me in the ladies bathroom
Give me a break, I can't take it, the stakes are too high
Besides, there goes the other brother
I'm not Keith Sweat, so don't sweat me
The other brother's smooth approach is what gets me
He intrigues the Mon you know
So I suggest the course towards me you blow
You're wasting time pursuing Monie
Cause she's pursuing the lover only
And as my mother did she told me
Go for what you know, Mo, yo

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

Bringing matters to a close and everybody knows
That I'm no longer in the middle
I made my decision, precisely, precision is a must
For me to solve another riddle
Step into a brand new rhythm,-ism schisms
Nope, I'm not with 'em, I've given
My undivided attention, you know what I'm saying?
No type of games I'm playing when

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 4x)Chorus:

4 da children let's stick together
4 da children try-make life a little better
4 da children try to make this world a better place
4 da children 4 da children

[Verse 1]
Mothers all over the world stop look alert
A lot of things are tryna meddle with your work
From the day you give birth your time becomes a little less
You got a permanent job in which there'll be no rest
You have to keep an eye open cause there's far too much to contend with
Hope you got a good partner you can go round the bend with
You have to accept that to a certain extent
Your private life is at a halt yep it's a true commintment
Well the horse is through the gate get ready now cause here they come
What you teach your child determines what they will become
How much your child is worth to you to this there is no digit
Brothers like Ed O G said be a father can you dig it?
I write this here song to express my sentimentality
And help to encourage some to wake up to reality
Of why your parents boss you around like indeed they do
I only understand because I'm now a parent too

Chorus

[Verse 2]
What a world what a world that we live in
People try to steal your babies and drugs is what is given
To a child by a child it's the style ain't it wild
Collectively the facts ain't a lot to make you smile
But s smile does exist among the dirt and the mist
It happens when the angel in your life is kissed
And loved and hugged and cherished and cared for
When the wounds of the world are sore
Hearts are breakin' hearts are breakin' can you see it
Being strong is must and we're too busy tryna be it
Staring out into a scum-filled a world with disgust
Define the line between success and gettin' left back in the dust
Opposition that arises you know we have to get over
And listen to those not only wiser but also older
Turn our children into responsible men and ladies
And to the cops stop beatin' on our babies

Chorus (2x)

I didn't bring a child into this world for politicians
Trippin' on each other starting wars and causing friction
Makin' life a little harder for those strugglin' to cope
Bring a cease towards your fighting instead of the people's hope
It's easy for the powers that be to make decisions
Tell you to get on with get on with who gave you the permission
Sending the youth that we produce to help you score
I don't see any of your kids so fight your own wars
As to discrimination little ones don't know the meaning
Unless we separate they could be on the same team
And it's okay to teach your child all their history
Until it somehow slowly develops to bigotry
Pass up opportunities to segregate the space
Think about the children's future make this world a better place
Before decide to act wild
Remember everybody is somebody else's child

Chorus (2x)[Verse 1]
I'm a mother that gave birth young, so what about it
Does it mean right away that I'm wrong
All in due time, well my time is right now
So don't ask me who, where, what when or how
I know I got me and a good partner beside me
One that will never try to desert of defy me
So who are you to tell me how to run my family
I can plan it by myself, I need nobody planning me
Cause yeah I might be young, but my stability's correct
Everything about my little one I must protect
What she sees, what she hears, and everything surrounding
A decent state of mind is what my daughter will be found in

Chorus:

Born 2 B.R.E.E.D
Young mother be thankful, be strong
The fact that you're young, it ain't wrong
A mother I will try to be
Tha fact is, I was born 2 B.R.E.E.D

[Verse 2]
So tell me what do the kids learn at school
How to pack a pistol, how to play a class fool
Then they blame the parents when the kid plays hooky
Subject to getting shot is something that I wouldn't wanna be
Maybe it is safer to stay within your home
Protecting yourself from getting a bullet within your dome
It's something to think about, the word safe
I often wonder if there exists such a place
Whether on a bus, a train, or plain walkin'
You're subject to the devious ones that might be hawkin'
I'll teach my child to respect every day as a blessing
And follow the path of her future lesson by lesson

Chorus

[Verse 3]
So ask me again if I need ghetto assistance
There's food on my table and my baby's not wearing piss pants
I could teach my child more at home that you could ever
Corrupt the youthful mind I produce, that will be never
This one will learn from me, the other babies too
Cause what you teach is censorship, I wanna teach what's true
So bother me not with our by the book method
If I was already deaf I would be getting deafer
I know exactly what I'm doing, in it I believe
My life is in my offspring Cause I was born 2 B.R.E.E.D

Chorus(Yeah)

[Repeat x2:]

(Repeat x3:]
(Get on up)
Get on up

[Repeat x8:]
(Get on up)Full term love (2x)

[Verse 1]
To be or not to be that is the question
Brothers be hawking sisters sometime with no intention
Of tryna get serious, I mean make a commitment
Come on honey insecurity flows in by the shipment
Pardon the expression but are you already taken
I live around the way boy so don't be tryna fake
And if you wanna know me better I suggest you follow
Cause I ain't tryna start up nothing destined to be hollow
You say you understand good no need for me to wonder
Wanna be my man alright well here's my name and number
But if you're not sure you better stop look listen and
Learn because I'm looking for a love that will last full term

Full term love (4x)

[Verse 2]
OK we're on a date you wanna take me to movies
Dinner and dancing and after that a little room please
No I'm not the one so the thought you can delete
Because it's very tracky and it's only been a week
Now you wanna hit the sheets (no) don't really think so
Make it all complete (no) I don't really think so
Wanna be fast then before you even blink I'll be talking to another
(Where'd) you meet him at the rink oh
Speedy Gonzalez you better slow down
Because I'm levelheaded with my feet on the ground
Why don't you try and do something constructive for instance
Committing to a love that will last the full distance

Full term love (8x)

[Verse 3]
You wonder why you see me at the bus stop everyday
It's because I have a job so there's nothing no one can say
Don't try to treat me like a stepchild with ring around the collar
Or even a pest because I don't want your dollars
It's simply just a cool thing called love and understanding
A little sincerity and that's all that I'm demanding
A brother who can say "honey your wish is my command"
And if you can't get it then I'll leave you where you're standing
I'm tryna get something that's mo' better
You see an easy around the way go sweat her
I'm telling you now without being undercover
That I might be an around the way girl
But I'm a full term lover brother

Full term love (8x)Honey looking butter, word? How's he living? Greasy

[Verse 1]
I remember Rick way back in prehistoric
Wearing holey pants and always reading Marvel comics
Never used deodorant, clothes were always soiled
Instead of body lotion, Rick used the Crisco oil
Never had a hair cut, breath was always stenching
Used to try to catch me sitting on the school bench and
Speaking to me, stinking to me, killing all the flowers
Wish I had a Certs in my pocket, he could devour
Now he's out the projects, no longer a resident
Heard his father died and left him crazy dead presidents
Seen the brother yesterday, pulled up in a Beamer
Looked me up and down and said "are you still a primadonna?"
I said no, I'll get with you if you want me
You're looking kinda buttermilk biscuit, on the money
No need for him to sweat, cause you got my respect
He's living kinda greasy, yep he got himself correct

[Verse 2]
Jimmy was a stick, Toothpick is what they called him
Never combed his hair, which is why his mother balled him
Used to stick up kids going home from other schools
Till somebody beat him down, flipped his butt and changed the rules
He was back around the way being someone else's Joey
Because he was bald they named him Obi Wan Kenobi
He said yo Imo be a rap star one day
They said shut your yellow teeth get me a forty okay
Well slap me upside my head, there go Jimmy
And there go all them brothers sayin' gimme gimme gimme
I see him on the box almost every other day
Ricochet from the down and out, butter up today
He made it to the top, to this there was no misdemeanor
And on Jimmy's side, you know the grass was always greener
So hop, skip and jump for the twinkle, not a deadbeat
Because he knew exactly how to rock the greasy beats

[Verse 3]
Knew a kid cursed with the kiss of being bummy
Never got any play, didn't find it very funny
He looked so scary and his head going bald
Liked to give us all his number, but nobody ever called
His name was Vom Boogie cause he's always throwing up
Loved to drink himself sick, never thought he'd ever stop
Used to like to wear socks all the way up to his knees
And he kept tryna talk to my girl Bonita B
I saw Bonita B. just a few moments ago
Riding round inside a Lexus, acting like she didn't know
Who I was standing there, that's alright cause she's a sucker
If he wasn't living greasy she wouldn't be with the brother
Count yourself lucky that you caught when you did
I might still talk to him regardless who he's with
Cause he looking kinda butter, and I think he could please med
Because he's living way beyond fat, he's living greasy[Verse 1]
Who ever said that you couldn't succeed
When your heart bleeds you need on your knees and you begging please
And if it ever came your way it be a better day
And if it don't, don't give up hope and continue to pray
I know I've had my fair share of despair honey
I wouldn't give up on the mere thought of mo' money
So this is what I did I forbid
The attitude that'll get ya
Suckered out of a picture
I never saw myself as some kinda hero
So listen up because your time could be near yo
Quitters never win winners never quit
If you don't believe in yourself nobody else will do it

[Verse 2]
The very young can be blinded
Thinking what they find is an easy way out
It's road that escapes the clout
Well think again because there's prices on another level
A faster route and now your foot is layin' on the pedal
When did your heart decide that you could just settle for less
Don't you know in your category you were truly blessed
I think you suffered a severe loss of self-esteem
And now it seems your whole life is a movie scene
You're still a rompa you can change if you really wanna
Double back recollect when you turned the wrong corner
Don't be content until you meet your demands
You can do it blood you can be a much better man

[Verse 3]
I had some lucky circumstances but I had to work
Amidst the possibility of maybe gettin' jerked
But I'm here ain't I and I'm in the mix too
That demonstrates how much a strong heart and mind can do
So please don't become a victim of pessimism
Keep your goals to yourself nobody messing with 'em
Keep your mind straight from those who wanna dictate
The spam of your intelligence they seem to underrate
It's a form of oppression that they demonstrate
And nine times out of ten they're guarded by a false plate
Never give up individual dreams
Of your future state and determine your own fate

[Verse 4]
Suckas that speak on a tracky technique
Choose to preach on a sub-level spewing evil of the devil
You gotta check it disconnect it to the minimal
Speaking tongues under drums like a subliminal
Figure that you gotta kiss before you kick
And every trick will then stick without licks you it's over dick
You didn't touch me then you don' t touch me now
Believing in the power of myself, I know how[Verse 1]
I'm glad heaven allowed me to be saved
The sidewalk to forever for me has been paved
I live a little passion every day I'm in your presence
And when I'm away I carry with me your very essence
I try to imagine a scenario without you
It doesn't happen cause my mind never doubts you
My admiration is in awe of your persona
Your plateau is high, everything else is much lower
How do I explain to you with lack of complication
Speaking to one who fills me up with exhilaration
I mean what I say, you know I really do
I'm just trying to say, in a word of 2
I love you

Chorus:

In a word or 2, I love you
Everything you do

[Verse 2]
Sacrifice is a word that's second nature
You give more than you take, it's hard for somebody to hate ya
Dream a little longer, I can penetrate your visions
Beauty lies within your thoughts to stay is what I'm wishin'
I love the way the world around you quivers but you float
Also how other people get frustrated but you won't
The way you relax while the world is so intense
I'm so much in love with you that sometimes it don't make sense
You please me in every way and I'll never make amendments
You are my teacher, I'll always be in attendance
I'd like to commend you for all the things I see you do
In a world or 2, I'd like to say I love you

Chorus 2:

In a word or 2, I love you
Everything you do
When I'm in your arms
There's no place I'd rather be
Stormy weather come
Oh, you go right through me

[Verse 3]
How can I even begin to thank you enough
The life I'd live if I didn't have you, it would be tough
I shudder to think of how empty my heart would feel
If you should disappear and none of this was ever real
I feel a quiet comfort when I am within your arms
You make all my stormy weather become a gentle calm
I wish to never be separated from such a bliss
The warmth of your touch, the motion of your kiss
I wish to never lose sight of the smile within your face
It's you or nothin', baby, you could never be replaced
So to let you know before I go, before I'm through
In a word or 2, I love you

Chorus 3:

In a word or 2, I love you
Baby, I really do
L-o-v-e you[Verse 1]
My sister, my sister, tell me what the trouble is
I'll try to listen good and give the best advice that I can give
So, what's up with you this time?
Your honey took a dive and now he's playin with your mind?
Oh no, this can not be accepted
The feelings that belong to you must be protected
Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat 2X)

[Verse 2]
Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
There's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know
It's time for you to show you're not sleepin
A progress report on the two of you, you're keepin
Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin
You estimated right, that night the other weekend
Collectively the facts should conclude the decision
You caught the brother in a terrible disposition

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat 2X)

[Verses 3]
That's it, pack it up, be wise my sister
Cause the facts keep stackin up, tell him, to kiss the you know what
Make sure the door is shut, behind you
I do believe the brother's out of luck, and stuck
But that's not, your P-R-O-B-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dum dum and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
And you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
Of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same
And it's a cryin shame

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat til fade)Gotta let a woman B a woman (2x)

[Verse 1]
Don't touch the merchandise you got it honey
You're standing here see me coming you try to puff out your money
And I sure don't give a toss about the car you drive
Whether Benz 500 SL or a banger five
So let me pass without a convo cause I'm not into
Your rap is kickin' boomin' a system with no rhytm to it
And I'll be mighty obliged if you just step to the side
And move your sorry frontin' butt before I run right through it
You think I'm fresh, O well best you'll never get to hear
And I got money in a bank account also my dear
So I don't need you hanging round to be my sugar daddy
So you can paddy on that paddy wagon but without me and you can...

Let a woman B a woman

[Verse 2]
Coming through coming through make my way my tank is full
Like Sald and Pepa said my cow died I don't need ya bull
So keep your skiving and conniving kindly to yourself
Nobody asked you for a statement stick it on a shelf
Cause Ima make it to the top to this there is no doubt
By my talent no stoppin' stones that's what it's all about
You can consider what you want cause I don't give a bit
A lot of things are blowin' up and you ain't part of shit
Go sing your boo boo song your life's a loser's drama
This chick is truly not with it so save it for your mama
Gettin' paid stayin' paid yep it is my way of life
I'm cuttin' through this funky rhythm as sharp as a knife
Your trashy talk is not romantic so get out my face
The litter of your loins is scattered up and down the place
So you can pucker up and kiss this here funky behind
I got to full cheeks I'll take you 2 at a time

Let a woman B a woman

[Verse 3]
Kickin' up a fuss cuss cuss you're full o' puss
We're the underground legionnaires you ain't part of us
All you do is complain all about the women's role
Little do you know it's climbing on the voter's poll
Babblin' babblin' babblin' babblin' but not sayin' nothin'
Bring a cease to all your speech punk and quit the bluffin'
On this groove I'll be as funky as I wanna be
So step off you little Chuck D wannabe
You can pop all that junk but keep it out my face
Make a move towards me and you will be erased
Stoppin' to a brother's level no I'm not sucker
Cause when you lay down with dogs you catch fleas motherfuckerGotta let a woman B a woman [x2]

[Verse 1]

Low and behold there's a story to be told
Of a sister who missed a plane
Destiny was rearranged
I never knew that I would be in this position
Makin' money makin' music makin' a complete transition
But hey in here yeasterday, today and tomorrow
Forever after that because none of my shit is borrowed
Cleverly constructed my flairs abundant
Developed from hangin' with all the roughnecks back in London
Pogo swiftly gets biznizz done with no parkin'
In a mellow manner cookies on the side sparkin'
Flavour la treacherous few will do you lovely
So don't run around playin' with you like you know money
Blessed when the Lord snipped my microphone cord
And said rock it any way you can you got the whole world in your hand
I made amendments to achieve my inner passion
Makin' performances in musical fashions
Check it out hypocritical subjects playin' like
Primadonna before they knew who I was yet
It's alright cause my rhyme will pack a fist full
Personification, smile, metaphor list full
Blissful is the interpretation I deliver
Make you quiver, make you kidneys dance all around your liver
I'm a giver of lyrical sex to your ear drum
Come all ya faithful to the record store and get some
Soul seasones with the future of the funk
It's not hard to find I stand out from the junk
Push a punk to oblivion spin 'em 'til they're dizzy and die
I won't be at that funeral cause I'm busy
Don't try to injust me suicidal you must be
If you suddenly develope the urge to cuss me
A lus will be given if correct is how you livin'
And the rhymes you recite are yours, not given

[Verse 2]
Sucka A sucka B sucka C or you talking 'G'
Or should I say pea brain no better yet shit-for-brains
You wanna save somebody save your bloddy self
It's grievous to see a waste of human tissue go to hell
Appointing yourself to be lord of the premises
When you look like death warmed up and you smell of piss
Hiss hiss hiss there a kiss of death coming
In your direction so you better start running
Doubleups of original creations
Is taking over rapidly false duplication
Artists that are supposed to be self-acclaimed
Tapping into other artists' domain
It's a bore to the brain blahblahblahblahblahblahblah
Shut the hell up I can't understand a word you're sayin'
I buy too and for what the hell I'm payin'
Check yourself before you point the finger and start slayin'
Method bottom pit used by emcee we ain't shit
Is the scraping of the barrel cause they're full of it
Yesterday's news tomorrow's forgotten thought
And how in the hell are you gonna pay for the shit you bought
Just like you I'm in it for self
Do whatever it takes whether you or someone else
It is amazing how the human mind works
Find somebody that you feel you can jerk
You should have never let yourself get talked into this one
Fuck around and your ass won't be a missed one
When it comes to the crunch on a lyrical basis
I pass with flying colors you might as well face this
I don't even wanna go on with this nonsense
You're just a repetitionist baby no contest
War with me and you'll wish you'd never been born
I'll shut your ass up quick and put a muscle on ya[Male's Spoken Intro]
Hey, man, I'm glad y'all could make it, bruh
Ladies gonna
Look at the ladies, mmm, mmm, mmm
Girl, girl, girl, whooo!
I tell you what. When I say you got to party, you got to PARTY
Uh, wait a minute, baby, wait a minute, wait a minute…

[Verse 1:]
Is you or is you ain't about yourself
And over everyone else?
You consider you the casanova?
Kiss me or kiss me not?
It makes no diff
Confidence struck?
You will get me?
I will say “If”
Give me the scoop
Loop past the loop of discussion
Buy me a drink and stop fussin'
A lot of other brothers got the money in their fingers
Oh, are you ready to order?
I'll take a ginger ale
Pale face? Do they speak with forked tongue?
Conversation's weak unless you know where you comin' from
Dip, dive, socialize
Gets kinda boring
Especially when the catch line is floorin'
Find a spot, take a seat
Don't try to flatter me
Tell me something I don't know
Already a degree of my interest
Is slow and very low
In order for me to stay tuned
You gotta show a form of other than stereotype rap
You got the gist of it, yeah, something like that
I know you wonder if you're in the right direction
Before I let you know, I got a question

[Chorus:]
Are you single?
Are you single tonight?
Would you like to mingle?
Are you single tonight?

[Verse 2:]
Do I have a man? No
But I have a baby father
I have a daughter aged 5
Does that bother you?
Oh, he passes by from time to time
Cause he believes in supporting what's his but also mine
Mother minus father and a brother
You ask if they're divorced
Skip the topic, hit another
Times up
What do I wanna do?
I wanna use the bathroom
I'll be quick if there's no traffic in the path room
Talkin' that “what about me and you tonight” and
What'd I tell you bout the stereotyping?
Relax
Don't push and scratch a possible friendship
Did I mention the fact
That I'm all about the friendship?
Oh
Well I mentioned it now
Take a sip of your beer
Cool out, mellow down
About your family, you were slick and took a pass
But I want to know something else such as…

[REPEAT Chorus]

Single, single, single, single, single
Single, single, single, single life
Single, single, single, single, single
Single, single, single, single life

[Verse 3:]
Memories of women that you had before
Spare me the violins, brother
Stringin' I deplore
Floor that thought, sport
I'm hip to that
Sucker me from sympathy?
Nope, got to scratch
First and foremost, I think you're cute and smart
Otherwise, I say A, you say B
Depart
In socializing, I am far from a beginner
Makin' people sorry for you don't make you a winner
Don't attempt to impress me by perpetrating
I like you for you
No need for demonstrating what's not you
So just do what's in your character
Take your time, be refined
I won't be mad at ya
Clearly state your intentions to know me better
Minus the cool-cat approach
And don't you get an attitude
When I speak straight and blunt
It simply shows you, my brother
That I don't front
Yes, I'd like to meet you in another circumstance
Oh this my jam, brother!
Come on and dance!
When the night is through
We'll get to know each other well, B
But you still got somethin' to tell me

[REPEAT Chorus]

(Uh huh)
(I don't think that's none of your business)
(Good god, good god!)

I want to know if you're single
I want to know if you're single
I want to know if you're single
(Girl)

I want to know if you're single
I want to know if you're single
I want to know if you're single

(Listen here. Just because I got this ring around my finger.)
(That don't mean I ain't single girl.)
(I tell ya, I got this out the Cracker Jack box.)
(It don't— it don't— it don't mean a damn thing, baby)

Are you single, baby?[Verse 1]
Some bitch called my house this morning
Telling me she was giving me a warning
That I was with her man point blank
She suggested I step or get spanked
But I don't know what is the scenario
As far as I know he was not a gigolo
She called back said her posse was fat
Said they'd beat my ass down with baseball bat
Now first of all how'd she get my number
I don't know but Imo kick her ass way down under
I said you and your posse can all eat shit
And when I kick it to my uncle then we'll see about it
So picture this my friend withbinoculars
When I find out who you are I'll be knocking ya
Upside your hand 'til you're dead cause I'm fed
And every time I think about you my eyes go red

Chorus:

What should I do? Get sexual (repeat 7x)
Marley Marl what should I do? Get sexual

I stepped onward withthis story
Tried to figure out who's that hooker that called me
Took time out to assess possibillities
Wondering who in the hell wanna get withme
Called my man up he just said yo
Hookers are scheming don't pay it no mind
You know 'mo 'mo leave it behind
Easy 4 you cause they ain't calling all the time
I said check this if you know them
Tell 'em to rest or Imo puncture their colon
Cause they don't know me and should not test me
Ignorance will get your ass busted up see
I know you know them so don't even feel it
You can get out too I damn sure mean it
I'll just flip and trip to plex you all
The type of stuff I be kickin' is sexual

Chorus:

What should I do? Get sexual (repeat 3x)
Marley Marl what should I do? Get sexual
What should I do? Get sexual (repeat 4x)

Hooker called my house again
Sayin' that her man was talking to her friend
Her man my man both one and the same
Pretty lame is the game he was playing on our brain
Well me is my so bitch don't try
I kissed his sorry black ass goodbye
Your name is not on my friendship list
Your telephone calls I will not miss
So step up quick to this hip chick
Just shut your lips watch me get slick
Or even butter sharp like a box cutter
Those who get withme could get any dumber
I'm the daughter of a sister now the mother of a daughter
Come along come along if you wanna get slaughtered
Imo chop you up real nice tonight
And you know sex you all means doing it right

Chorus:

What should I do? Get sexual (repeat 7x)
Marley Marl what should I do? Get sexual[Verse 1]
Hello and hallelujah for the Wheel of Fortune
Thank God they got a selection of men they can auction
Be him black be him white
Rude, stink or polite
They got catalogue you know
Honey Dips hold tight
Form a line form a line
Behind me U know what I'm sayin'
I bin waiting since last year child I'm not playin'
Imo find myself somebody if it takes all week
Find me a piece of butt and no longer will I seek

[Verse 2]
First off I got a drug dealer
A heart stealer
Bucks hangin' out his butt
To him it was no big deal
Bought me this bought me that
Tried to spread me forget that
My name was not Country Crock
You big Spock-looking muskrat
Having money don't make you God
Find yourself a hole for you to stick your rod
No no no we can't be lovers
No no no we can't be friends
Only one thing left to do
Have to spin again

[Verse 3]
The second was a bum crumb
Nothing having mug
Personality OK but face looking like a pug
He said "Come over to my house and watch movies"
I said who me so that you can do me
Not that I would but at least the dealer would have paid
You don't want to spend no money and you wanna get laid
Back off!
Here's a dollar and the deal
Treat yourself to White Castle's
For me it's back to the wheel

[Verse 4]
The third was a white collar working in Manhattan
When he walked when he talked
When he ate there was a pattern
He tried to change the way I dressed and I talked
Showing me the difference
In the different types of forks
I said "hey Mr. Connoiseur, you can stuff it"
You gotta love me for me or love nothin'
Take your forks and shove 'em all
Where the sun don't shine
And I'm back to spin the wheel just one more time

[Verse 5]
The final was a cop from up the block
The type that catches kids
From picking next door neighbor's locks
He liked to keep tabs
Don't you know he was a psycho
He also liked to hit
I said well now it's time that I go
I said don't touch me you might lose your nutz
I'll stick 'em in a pickle jar and wouldn't give a butt
Keep your hands to yourself if you know what I'm sayin'
There's a knife in my bag
Brother man I'm not playin' ya know

[Verse 6]
There you go there you have it
Wheel of fortune didn't work
Instead of meetin' gentlemen I met a bunch of jerks
One wid too much money the other not a cent
One too snobby and the other had no sense
I guess for Monie it's right back to the drawling board
How long will it be before I actually score
I gotta find somebody to unleash all this affection
I know what Imo do
I think I'll try the Love ConnectionIf you came tonight, and you feel all gold
Somebody say HOOOOOOOO! (HOOOOOOOOOO!)
HOOOOOOOO! (HOOOOOOOOOO!) And you don't stop
Clap your hands to the beat to the beat just clap to your hands to the beat (everybody just)
Clap your hands to the beat to the beat just clap to your hands to the beat (check it out)

[Monie Love]
