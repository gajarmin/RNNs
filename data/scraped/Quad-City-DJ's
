[Duston Anderson]
In the middle of the field the stadium's packed
The crowd was roarin', the time to attack
30 long, what it gon' be
I'm comin' round the corner for the QB	
Can't run or hide from the take down "D"
Make another team, still like Queens, I'm mean

Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
Ain't gon' stop till I get another ring, now
