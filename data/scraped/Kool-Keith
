"Now the first drop of juice is there for her to see
Honey, that's when she backs off and just lick her teeth..."

Chorus:
(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)

You want freestlye, that's right, the style is free
Niggas suck my dick and they girls drink my pee
I'm on some S&M shit you can't get with
Pull your panties down on stage and watch you sweat quick
Suckers back to pull they style is transsexual
Lesbians dance with the funky heterosexual
You on the mic, and when you rhyme I start to jerk off
Let my dog lick you German Shepherd want to bust off
I tear your legs and spot MC's having anal sex
Step around like a Tampax, and step up next
I enter New York, no problem with my dick out
California porno star, my ass you can lick out
Saying "What?" with sperm dripping down your partner's butt
I see MC's in my face with their ass up
Let me put my cape on, my rubber and my mask up
Not no horror-core shit, this is porno-core
I'm in the club naked man, I'm the fucking pro
Niggas can't wax no ass, girls should let them know

Chorus x3

Back I wreck shit, so what nigga? I masturbate
See your girls' cocked back, her legs tied like a figure eight
I'm on stage getting sucked by Madonna
Sticking pipes in your ass, you stop the freestyle drama
I pioneered this shit, you keep on sucking dick
Your girl's in the crowd, hawking me for a naked flick
I got my silk underwear for the atmosphere
Piss in your face and urinate all in your hair
You name a group that's shit, I will pooper-scoop
Fuck with this, miss, I will damage on the premises
Niggas step back with Dax grease, watch their ass twist
I rhyme anywhere, golden showers up in Greek Alley
Movie star bitches, MC's lining up in Cali
Drinking vodka, Absolut, sipping Tanqueray
Mc's jump off, I stung your rectum like a stingray
Girls heinie-wipe, MC's say my shit is hype
Pussies collapse, I'd rather fuck 'em with a cordless mic
Come ride the horse, pull your panties off and pay the cost

Chorus x2

"May they beat his balls with a ten-pound hammer
'til his asshole whistle the Star-Spangled Banner."

Now the nurse is here, Dr. Butcher to your anus
I don't care who your are, and if you think you're famous
You could be waxed, seventy-five fucking rap groups
Bisexuals on stage eating Fruit Loops
Sugar Smacks, I got the rhythm for your ass cracks
Bring your girl, she fantasize in my sex world

Chorus x3[Kool Keith]
Sexy girl!
Okay-double-oh-L, Keith
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl!

Sexy girl in sheer panties, I'm the driver in your life
I love to steal panties, the more closer you are near panties
Observin your home amateur VHS tape
I love the around the house motion pictures you make
Your neighbor with whip cream, your legs smeared with Duncan Hines
Your thighs meet my fingers, I taste the thing
The fudge, the great chocolate cake, Niagara Falls is not needed
I'm above the swimming pool dressed up like Dracula
I'll bite your neck by the lake
The script's a natural, I can't beat Paramount Pictures
The backdrop behind Capitol Records is fake
Girl you're beautiful, how do you control your weight?
(How do you control your weight?)

Sexy girl! Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl!

Home alone, touchin yourself in different places by the phone
After midnight the blacklights flow you're in the love zone
The microphone adjusted to the love tone
Keys to your heart, you've now completed the task
Gimme the secrets to your combination, the captain and the boss
Got your bra in my hand, the guidance counselor, your life I own
Your official support, every time you cry and moan
I brought the freak out of you, the way you neck the leak out of you
My desire for you ain't false, everything I write about is true
Your favorite singers are old to me
They're primitive, stuck in time, I'm brand new

Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl!

Over and over, don't get me wrong
While you walk around and pace the floors in your satin thong
Between the sheets - you have the electric feelings reach
Pullin my lips to your fruits of passion
Two pineapples in my face, my tongue taste the tip of your peach
I send flowers to doors, UPS packages circulate the streets
When I celebrate the victory, Jergens lotion glaze your feets
With my hand palmin each bun, I'ma show you girl
The police officer badge, the uniform and handcuffs will make you have fun
Kneel down to your kitten bowl
Your rearview is awesome, I watch the lips unfold

Sexy girl!
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl! {*echoes*}(all vocals by Kool Keith)

Yo, I used to check out lyrics upon the formats
Built with skill with technique, computer ADAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought, flow, acrobat
Sync the track, pump the track
Dance missions clubs like spores react by strobe visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dance floor
Blowing up, and having mad people showing up
Packing crowds, jam packed venues
Needles collapse while atmosphere continues
Sprinkle that
Win it like that, move it like that, hitting like that
The melody is phat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss with Prodigy
Flipping astrology
My intellects devour
...with diesel power

Chorus:
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Repeat 3x

Win, spin back, rewind, diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
It has to be, automatically
Check it out, you'd better work it out
Change to another route
My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords to mics hanging like spring leaves
Doing tracks so fast, beyond the human eye
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
Es and pepped up, you get swept up
Smacked up, backed up
Your crew's all cracked up
Check it, slow pitch, who's quick, you can't stick
My metaphor range is strange as angles
You get tangled
Twist inside affections
Channels repeat, complete, can't be beat
Check the hour texture
Mind adventure, exploit the point
Into tracks to devour
My intellects proceed
...with diesel power

Chorus

Back attack the whack packs you faxing me
You don't want none, high quality action, be
Still standing, damaging your other manning
Quick reverse, potent as the first verse
My amplifier, blows on your world's higher
World sire, cuts like a barbed wire
Record player, I pull up on you everyday
Fast forward, I move and I swing toward
Exit load, put your brain in right mode
Select and mix
The man will perfect and fix
Heads lightly, bite me, copy, xerox, cock sand blocks
You can't knocks, I'm out there
Upbeat, lifting, shifting
Persistent intelligent kingpin
Flipping astrology, as I roll with Prodigy
...with diesel power

Chorus

Mono 7-0-6, 8-0-7-3

Chorus[Kool Keith]
Yeah
Every morning I wake up, lookin in the mirror
I am, the original Black Elvis
That's right when you see me, with my wig to the side
Wearin my short leather jacket
Marilyn Monroe on my back
I'm livin that life
I'm for real with this
That's what I think about
I like to tell my fans

I got my shades on, big rock star, compared to Elvis
Signin autographs for rappers, while girls move they pelvis
Write songs quickly, for Elton John or Lionel Richie
Call up my butler, get clothes washed by the maid
Ivory soap, this is clean, feel like Cascade
I count the bills, roll to Detroit in Sedan DeVille's
I throw my skully on, big robe like Marvin Gaye
Step in the front row, primetime I move your way
Budweiser Fest soundcheck, demanding more respect
I come correct through the Metro, and turn y'all petrol
I'm up here early bitin donuts sippin on espresso
While you sleep, I creep, gainin ground by the week
Ampex reels, makin phone calls, I'm closin deals
I move with skill, ride through Philly streets and Cherry Hill
I'm doin it well, I'm doin it swell
Yeah

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two

Movin roughly, straight to the desert, San Antonio
I talk swift the Rock King Black Romeo
I pack clubs, promoters put me out in Tokyo
Damage your area, I'mma launch a fierce missile
I roll schools, movin butt like I'm toilet tissue
What is your issue? You over man, I don't miss you
Scottie soft, you play like Jan Van Breda Kolff
New Jersey Nets real man, you ain't no Darnell Hillman
Bald head like Slick Watts, I run rap like Mayor Koch
Forward your info, while Tony Liu, crank the Benzo
Move out your driveway, white girls look, turn they eyeway
Jealous in fact, tryin to rip the capes off my back
I move with timing, potential, through instrumentals
Y'all front on BET with slum gold, drivin rentals
I get real dino, runnin groups like a rhino
Endin careers, that's my job, yo your rap is final
Cancel your in-stores, your new job is moppin floors
Fixin tiles, stoppin potholes up on the roof
You work for service no tips man I speak the truth

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two, one two

Pull your hoods down, I bumrush your afterparty
Have your manager scared, the radio station say I'm sorry
Pack your bags, I move my luggage to the coliseum
Infinite prime piece with statues in the rock museum
Changin my zones, drinkin cocktails on cellular phones
I tour with Anthrax, through Texas with the Rolling Stones
Booked by the agency, famous artists payin me
Hotels with fly room, with sneakers starin at the moon
Mad atmosphere, ridin first class on British Air
Lobster and steak, while y'all back in time, doin remakes
I'm futuristic, nine-nine, to the year 4000
I make announcements, drop skills, then I bounce with
Fly young ladies, AMG kicks, two thousand Mercedes
Brand new models, only seen one, in Colorado
Light green metallic in the Shark Bar, eatin salad
Lorenzo wheels, valet park, shoppin in Beverly Hills
Step up your wildest spaceship kid, in the Plymouth Prowler
Comin down

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two one two[Intro]
Yeah!
For the 2000 (2000)
Black Elvis (Black Elvis)
We get raw with this (hand me my guitar)
Tour bus packed (tour bus packed)

[Verse 1]
Black Elvis, recordin in the 48-track studio
Madison Square Garden soundcheck, to speak direct
Fans in the upper level, backstage passes
Wearin diamonds around my glasses, leather coat
Thirty thousand from Wilson, countin the mill's
I'm talking to Andre Harrell with a chaffeur drivin me around
In the green Rolls Royce, parked parallel, on Fifth Avenue
Steppin in Bloomingdale's, waitin for Celine Dion to get her nails done
Tour dates start tommorrow, MCI send the cash through Wells Fargo
Black Elvis, 28 G's a night
Tour bus with the Motley Crue, who gon' stop who?
Rock star don't need no tattoo
Guitar out of the sharp, Fender bass with the Stratocaster
With Prodigy, Rage Against the Machine, flyin over the Atlantic ocean
With the potion

[Hook]
Black Elvis, rock star, walkin down Broadway
What y'all thinkin about?
Black Elvis, rock star, walkin down Broadway
Chillin in the project hallway

[Verse 2]
Tour bus, painted neon green with black wheels
We do big wheels, count big head Franklin bills
Movin up that's when I'm Black Elvis at the Civic Center
Promoter book venues that are too small, ignore the call
Seventy thousand jam packed arenas
With rock fans wearin backpacks
Merchandise sell nice gold shirts with red lights
Sponsored by Dial soap and a Heineken
The biggest rock star gon' rhyme again
Roadie cases for eight months, Samsonite suitcases
Rappers comin home with no money on the red eye with dead eyes
Stadium tickets, watch scalpers get wicked
Pull up in my limo ejecting your demo (your demo)
Stretch lamborghinis with four doors, with four floors
Followin right behind yours, basic Continental
Get out your rental before I get mental
(Yeah baby)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Huge signs on highways, you see the biggest advertisements
I'm at Tim Mandelbaum's office getting my next assignment
Walk in the Sony building, grab checks
Stop in a Hilton, Warner Brothers/Chapell on the back
Of my royalty statements, my name is Matthew
Three apartments on the West with 200 songs
Five minutes each on Ampex reels
At the Shark Bar chewin billionaire meals
At the Apollo, can you digest?
I'm a hard act to swallow
With a Paris France model, with a real estate agent
That's building me a kid's playground in Denver, Colorado
Vacation unknown when I'm speakin 3-way with Roberto Duran
And Sugar Ray Leonard on the cellular phone
Upstate Connecticut, hold you rap style with a better grip
(I'm a rock star now)

[Hook][Kool Keith]
You know baby
I've been thinkin about you a lot
You know I've been doin a lot of.. private things on my own
Just me in the bathroom, by myself
You know, a little hands on experience
You know, just a little thing for myself

Yo, I'm six million dollars, rappin like I'm Steve Austin
Made of steel, diamonds glitter on the Ampex reel
Superchargin my brain cells, glowin extra large and
My afro sheen, skin color should be green
Girls in the backseat, with thongs stuck between they booboo
I'm rappin through you, on sidelines he's talkin to you
My finesse in Batmobiles, cruise with Adam West
Down Bronx streets and project buildings holdin flashlights
Daily newsies, pull your maxi's out, in the movies
Make you think fast, rub powder on your diaper rash
Catch you with stomachs out, bumps out, and Jenny Craig'n
You still be beggin, with that body shaped, like an egg'n
Rhinoceros funk, with panties piled in the trunk
Playboy books with Black Tail, my boy, readin Hustler
I pull up with no Benz, just a Plymouth Duster
Cruisin around town, naked bumpin James Brown
Underwear light blue, scratchin balls with hands down
You see me comin passin rappers like I'm Mr. Drummond
On your street pee, your colored socks, smell like feet
Timberland boots walk in Bentley's with my space suits
Astronaut sneakers standin hard by the speakers
Kool Keith..

Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 2X)

We got butlers with maids, condos built, in Brazil
Chrysler Cordovas, Monte Carlos on the hill
The raw ingredients, with hands on experience
With Nissan trucks, worth a hundred thousand bucks
We got butlers with maids, condos built, in Brazil
Chrysler Cordovas, Monte Carlos on the hill
The raw ingredients, with hands on experience
With Nissan trucks, worth a hundred thousand bucks

[What What] + first four lines overlap chorus
What's he talking about?
I don't get it..
..
Hmmmm..
Ooooh!
..
Yo I bust my own, ready to feel thrusts
My lust explodes in loads, feelin like Big Pun
The crush, rushin to phones, for episodes, atone for sex
And videos, layin at home, that's stamped with X (hahaha)
You feelin me yet? Well then I, guess I'll commence
With my five niggas rubbin, resort-in to self lovin
White blood runnin (yo well that's some really nasty shit)
Oh, oh well I wouldn't y'all thinkin I'm a sadomasochist
I'm past the list of niggas who masturbate
I flash my wrists, when there's no brothers to pass the gate
Holdin myself down when I'm on the clit
I've got gadgets like I'm fuckin James Bond and shit
Flippin myself, hittin the spots, keepin it hot
Got the lights off, porn's on, ready to rock, fukkit
"Ohhh What What!" I praise myself
And I haven't went blind, I've got days of health
Even amazed at the stealth speed my hand flicks
I represent for chicks and niggas with they hands on they shit
Hah, you got experience?

Chorus

[Bobbito Garcia]
Yo yo yo
It's Hand Solo, one time again
I'm no jerk my friends, just for dick again and again
I put a towel up on the floor
For easy post-cleanup, get up, close my door
So my roommate won't bust me
Like my mom did, and my dad did
And my college roommate did, with Jergens in my palm
That's why now, I do it dry
So that's the set up, I tilt my head up
Puy my fingers on my nipple, swish around my pre-cum dribble
Rippin epidermis cause it's easy to be
Shootin loads to go to bed, cause it makes me sleepy
Titties on my mind, close to ejaculation
Anal perspiration, heavy inhalation
I strive for the shoulders, in Boulder Colorado
Shoot on walls and toilet stalls is my motto
It's like that y'all y'all and you don't dare stop stop
I grab my cock until the cum drops
Mr. Eon -- you got hands on experience? (You know I do)
Grab the mic and get delerious

[Mr. Eon]
Callouses on my hand, both left and right
Vaseline, magazine, and my lovin hand with a tight
Slip, put my wood in a vice grip
And then Janet Jack-me with them fine ass lips
I spew goo in the form of Elmer's Glue
Up in my mind, a pornography who's who
Channel 35 receiver, dick reliever
Spank to the thought, of me shavin beavers
I'm Mr. Miyagi, wax on, wax off
I even jerked at dinner, on the tableclothes
Paper towel napkins, tissue's not the issue
I know you be fearin this, hands on experience

So there you have it
Live, from the perverted minds
Of Kool Keith, What What, Bobbito and Mr. Eon
Another case of hands on experience

Put your left hand on, pull your left hand off
Put your right hand on, and we jerk it til it's soft
We do the knuckle shuffle til the cum run out
That's what it's all about!

That's what it's all about"Yeah, Kool Keith should keep it real
He should(en't) rap about space and Mars..."

[Kool Keith]
Yo, I'm tired of looking at everybody. Same boots, skully hats in
90 degree weather, looking to get into clubs for free. I'm not
Smoking blunts, or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt

I left New York, the city itself was stress depression
High boots and urban beats, that wasn't my direction
Producers filtering join in with R&B
A million rappers, some clones trying to sound like me
Biting my space styles, biting my horror-core
All I saw was little Kool Keiths, on my tour
Record companies, I G'd-off all my royalties
Watching vinyl spin, local groups' wack MC's
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap
Karl Kani jeans, fat stomachs in the limosines
Mixtapes by wack DJ's, as doo doo play
I'm on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway
Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion
On videos out of town, peoples spot confusion
Rolling high with caps pulled over down my eye
Since I been out, y'all can't see

Chorus x2:
Is the world made of plastic?
Is the city buried in dreams? (Yeah)
Is the world made of plastic?
Cause that's the way is seems (Owww)

Watching TV so bored, while imbiciles hold the mic cord
Graffiti playgrounds are played out, yo how'd that sound?
Army fatigues are weak, is for the minor leagues
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented Benz
Crews on stage, acting hard with a thousand friends
I saw the place turn plastic, crack heads looping beats
People with no deals, walkmens rappin on the streets
I turned my back, 90% of the city sounded wack
Payola scams switch DJ's like a rubber band
Everybody clear with beats trying to be Premier
Clearly all samples, your SP-12 fake examples
My money grosses with green from my own label
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label
Your tri-state ways are shut down by barricades
In fact I pack my bags, and listened to E-40
Mac Mall, C-Bo, and other rappers you don't know
You're narrow-minded in styles of mine you won't find it
My sound proceeds with Moog and undertone bass
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face
I come back real, solid rock razor steel
Tappin your program, show the world I'm the man
You copy Poppa Large, the industry is robbed

Chorus x2

As I do see soda, wack, rugged beer commercials
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles
From Manhattan I heat up, yo light up Times Square
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare
No promotional shows, girls wear corn rows
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes
I walk with straw hats and glasses in the projects
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage
Playing my numbers, waiting for the Five to come
Spaghetti out the window, people acting dumb
Fire hydrants wet the neighbors, your family's nosy
I come and go as I please on blockhead MC's
You bought sneakers, no car, scrambling on the corner
I'm not the star you are, the city's fallen far
My mechanism, you're on my tip
Stay off my penis, you've duplicated me for years

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are the one

Chorus x2[Hook]
Sorta break it down like this

[Kool Keith]
Yeah, Kool Keith's brother, Sinister 6000
Four thou, 39 kilowatts
Drop lyric, eternal funk combined
Blah, blah, supersonic force
Colt .45s amped up
Gates pump, compressors leak
Maximum outstrength the bass
Tweeters stretch your limbs
JBL, Dolbys, Adacs, Impacts
Transfer to the wax
Sinister 6000, new rap styles I be housing
My style is Europe
Freestyles that pump in Amsterdam
Rip the Mackie 32, expanding new Pro Tools
Stadiums packed with speakers, 15000 people
Digital formats with Sony amps pumping equal
We're rapping fire
No joke, I'll burn your crew for hire
With big dynamics, on this atomic aerobics
Female vocals choke, them highs get them systems broke
Buy software that's industrial, metal hardware
Vocal rap 4000
At least these X2 war compounds like high tech voodoo
Sequence range is strange like maggots growing in your brains
8000 bugs crawling on your skin
I'm back again my friend
Sinister 6000, 5'11", 7000
Black monsters in the house
Who want to step to the invisible man
As I chamber, like you in command(Chorus)
[Esham]
All night everyday
[Heather Hunter]
You can have it your way baby
[Esham]
All night everyday
[Heather Hunter]
I can give you whatchu need
[Esham]
All night everyday
[Heather Hunter]
Beats keep bumpin' 'round my way
[Esham]
All night everyday
[Heather Hunter]
Body needs my super cream

[Esham]
Get me paid, get sprayed, hang wit' homies that's made
Come through ya town, put it down like a parade
See I come from Detroit and it's all about Dylan
When I Black Jack five dollas stacked to the ceiling
In my V12 'Boomin' Words' straight from Hell
Blaze green all day, tell me what do ya smell
Bump the beat up in city heat, double-oh-7
East side I ride, AK-47
You can get a lap dance for less than 20 dollas
Playas in my city known for poppin' they collas
The styles that you runnin' 'round wit' is ours
You and them 'Shady' suckas is nothin' but cowards
Bang ya brains in the dirt, make ya go bezerk
If you rap wit' Emily, your ass gon' get murk
I'm the E to the S to the H-A-M
If I wasn't then why would I say I am
Pull a jack, sell a sack 'cuz the babies need similac
You remember that rollin' in a Cadillac
You wanna' battle rap, I swing the battle axe
Chop ya head off until Hailey go tattle that (da-da)

(Chorus)

[Heather Hunter]
All night everyday you can have it ya way
I gotta clock my pay from Detroit to LA
Ok, it's Heather Hunter not the 'Number 1 Stunna'
In the Collady Fair, fast as the Road Runna
The bitches they speak about, the freak of the week no doubt
Ya man was late for dinner 'cuz he was eatin' me out
I get it on like that 'cuz I was born like that
Ya man jacked off to my porn in fact
'Cuz it's too hard to mack me
I be 'Cummin' on America' 'Action and Jack me'
Cream on, Heather Hunter, twice as nice
Screw the right thing and watch the ice bling
So tell me how you want it, push or pull
2Pac was ridin' me on a mechanical bull
It's all I think about, when I be puffin' on a blunt
Plus I give head like a Shaolin Monk

(Chorus)

[Kool Keith]
I used to pick up a pan
My friend keep a CD in the van
People to win you can
NATAS back now, suckas don't slack now
No time to act now, me on the East Side
Rollin' the E ride, girls can come slide
Into the dark room, emotional heart room
Bass can bang-boom, X and mushrooms
Hotels paid for, freakin' in all the rooms
Girls, booties get live tonight, spread the lap dance
Y'all get high tonight, ladies in love
On my jock, and cry tonight, suckas say 'Why tonight'
Pick up the hotline, baby, you think ya fine
I'll putcha first if ya wanna be the girl of mine
Wine and dine, puffin' chronic, crime
Move ya curse, grab ya purse
Me and E shootin' fireworks
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-fireworks

(Chorus)

Honey with the gloss white diamonds, frosty lips
Movin with hypnotic sips
Movin the packer, I'm in the ride, leanin to the side
Turnin up the Bar-Kays
Firecracker, the parking lot macker
Maxi, Stacy, women sport the Stay Free
Like Prince all the panties hit the floor in one room in Paisley
With Naughty By Nature, stippin Stoli
Peach on the rocks with Vinnie, Treach and KayGee
Volume up, the club is open, nothin closin at 3
V.I.P. comes reserved, with Ronnie B
Are you blind out there, can Ronnie see?
The power of the Miramax picture
Hold up girl, wait a minute, players don't rush
Hold the cards, please, I'ma get wit'cha
Ladies ready for departure, show ID let me card ya
I see the T-backs through your slacks
I like it jiggly a little larger

In the club I enter the room
In the ladies room where the flows {?} soon

Gettin no love from sharin the bub

[Hook]

[uncredited rapper]
Yo what'chu gonna do now (what?)
It's all messed up now (tell 'em)
The club rushed up, crunked up now
Chickens all fucked up on Bacardi now
The spot blown up, yo they wanna go nuts
It can go now, yeah
We out of control, we out of your mold
We broke it, 10 years ago (10 years)
We start to roll, I can go 50/50 (ooh)
Aiyyo you out of your goal (that's right)
You out of your reach, we comin now it's the beast (peace)
Big and brolic, we pass the chronic (yeah)
Freaks jump on it... YEAH!
And from the back nigga, I pumped on it
Top finesse
East coast right back to West
Snap your neck, EPMD style
Aiyyo we stackin them checks
We buy the bar out (yeah) beef cookout
We bring the mob out (where we at)
Tony Draper style, Suave House

[Outro]
Can I touch ya butt girl?  Can I squeeze ya butt girl?
Can I feel ya butt girl?  Can I touch it?
Can I touch ya butt girl?  Can I squeeze ya butt girl?
Can I feel ya butt girl?  Can I touch it?[Kool Keith: talking]
Yeah
All you ladies walkin around in the club
With them fake engagement rings on
Acting like you married
The Captain is here
We shall report to the front
And all you guys acting like you real players
Who always talk behind peopla back
I never see you with no girls!
It's gettin kinda strange, funny style
Let the Captain begin

[Kool Keith]
White Stesson hat, fur manicure, matchin mink
Makin NBA players start to think, who's that standin' over there
Takin pictures for Rolling Stone magazine with a leash on a polar bear
Sky blue suit from Milan, girls posin their executive area
Acting like they don't see me, standin in front of me
Walkin by me three or four times
Showin me views of they Victoria Secret thongs, tryin to turn me on
Eyewitness news interrupt the Shane Mosley fight
Just to pan in closer to my shoes
Televised, myself beyond cellular phones and buisness cards, I network
Make the Billboard, number one singers and rappers
People from RCA, Clive Davis net-hurt

[Hook - 2x]
Save 'em (save 'em)
Captain save 'em all (save 'em all)
Save 'em (save 'em)
Captain save 'em all (save 'em all)

[Kool Keith]
Cover my face with Rayban glasses, from photographers I try to hide
Ladies with lingerie cry, cause I wear protection won't come inside
Places get empty when I leave
Pay butlers 600 dollars a minute just to adjust my cufflinks, and my shirtsleave
In 2003, in the double R, I lean metallic green
Professional chauffeurs over my doors
Women lust over my lyrics like basketball players
NFL teams walk up unbenouced
Excuse me! I'm talkin to Tristar Pictures right now
Keyshawn Johnson I heard you a great football star
I'm not plastic, but I'm on a conference call
Talking to Michelle Phieffer and Ben Barene
Go down stairs to the movie theaters
Me and my old lady like the persuaders
Morrie alligators, 800 combination flavors
Countin presidents, we stand with cash mil's, like the Miz

[Hook - 2x]

[Kool Keith]
Jacuzzi bathtub, with a 24-second clock to take your panties down
If not most girls get replaced by a sub
Sent home, upscale in a limosine with a Subway sandwich and a dub
Erased from the system
I move better, collared shirt made of leather
Why would you be walking around Beverley Hills wearin pleather?
With lights, camera, action
A part of my MCing is a small fraction
Strong machines coming on Greyhound from Memphis
Girls screamin at the Captain, "I wanna be saved!"
Me and Barbara Streisand walking down the corridor, with more
(And so much to offer)

[Hook - 2x]

Save 'em! (save 'em)[Kool Keith]
Yeah, straight from the ranch
Motion Man {*echoes*}
J. Reno, Kool Keith {*echoes*}
Kool Keith

I used to rock a booty butt banger with a hanger
Snap back with back slaps, bypass them corny raps
Perhaps some action, maxin in the Turb' relaxin
Unique investigator, sportin Moire alligators
From here to Virginia, clubs when I step up in ya
Tell the maid from my toes, to my shoulder blade
Extreme act up on front stage, make em back up
You get that workout, that head piece gettin slapped up
Now turn yo' lip up, you drop that mic you turn yo' lip down
I spin on stage like, blowin mics, make you sit down
From here to North Carolina, 95 to South Carolina
Atlanta Georgia Florida flowin down, like I'm water
Mexican Indian, fly girls, the Puerto Ricans
Pum-pum-pump the eight-oh-eight-oh-eight-oh-eight-oh peakin
Now start spectacular, expert, them legs will work
Bronx Bomber watch em strip, Eddy tip that fine mama
Hydraulics expand, while drums bang like Gap Band
I clap hand, take his mic, give him five to my man
Switch his work to talent shows, I do concerts
Light up shirts like 4th of July atomic fireworks
Extraction attack, white backpacks on wack macks
Yeahhhhhhhh...

Chorus: Motion Man + Kool Keith (repeat 2X)

[M] Clifton! Santiago
[K] Keith, Telavasquez (PSYCH!)

[Clifton Santiago]
My name is Cadillac Clifton Santiago
At the bodega, I need a fat sandwich major
You know my switches, Impala drop, scrapin sparks
I mack these bitches, white Asian Puerto Rican
Black Russian Haitian, with jungle fever, I ain't hatin
A cup more Coppertone, I'm cappin on your kinky ear
Bitches they stare, cause I'm WILD cock diesel
Boy hopin that I recognize they girls in this song
Bodda-boom-bodda-bing bodda-bing-da-bing-bong, yo check it
I call up Televas-quez, he's gettin ass
And when he finish, call up Santiago and bring the cash
I'm out to desecrate, move wild Western state
I got your sister lickin ass, suckin hairy balls
My occupation downfall and bringin niggas bad luck
My name is Clifton Santiago salesman at the mall
I'm full ?, a hundred niggas deep up in the movies
Like Greg I'm groovy, yo Bobby sit and watch the movie
And kick that ho out with that one tooth, lookin goofy
She's on my tab, better make popcorn to pay her half
They know I'm wild, I don't mess around with chickenheads
Barney and Fred, Wilma Betty Bam-Bam Pebbles
(On different channels, lyrics)

Chorus

[Ev Dog]
Slidin through the back of the do'
You didn't see me in the midst, with my pistol, Ev Dog
Flyin heads is my job, I will clobber you
Walkin backwards, shoes and jacket turned around
Gloves on, opposite hands
Can you recognize me?
I wear Blu Blocker shades so you can't see what I see
Holdin a mirror up, so I don't run into nobody
But I don't care, cause I know karate (HI-YAH!)
Vulcan Pinch and that Yoga too
Don't you know I'm Stretch Armstrong in the flesh
With a mocha tan, and a criminal mind?
Like Chairhead Chippendale, yeah
Comedy? Yes, no? Maybe not
But if I got a lip don't zip
Baggy jeans on, walkin through a crowded room
Avoid all contact with me, click boom!
People scatter stop that chatter they resort to screamin
Am I dreamin, drunk or just zooted out?
I need help call 9-1-1 pronto
My modus operandi is complete
One down, many to go, others to show
The argonaut is ain't no fuckin circus sideshow
Ringling and Barnum and Bailey we are not
Wild Kingdom Mutual of Northern Cal
Hahahaha..

Chorus 2XI make you drip-drop and bop, and swing and move your head back
When you're driving your car, you listen close to the star
Rhythm X I funk flock fleet and flowaway
Garbage I throwaway to take it to the pickup truck
Suckas don't give a beep necks don't give a beat
I bet a buck on your wife, I make another hit
Stomp my comp out and swing like yogi berra
Get another buick, a brand new riviera
Green coupe mercedes, a rolls royce maybe
Have madonna on tour with the carriage in my baby
Little Rhythm X first, second Poppa large
If a girl come in third we'll name em' Mary J. Blarge
My funky style, with my funky freaky rhythm
Keep the brothers on the corner with the gossip in the rhythm
I know I'm bad too the bone
I hang alone

CRUSIN IN STYLE, I WANNA FLEX
(COLD PEEIN' ON EM)

Continue I ease back and stretch in my limousine
Look at the corny rappers who're faking and wilin' mean
I know I'm hungry as hell, I hit your barrels
Italian kids, with my tape in they camero's
I'm not down with the ?mirk ,merkts?, the chicken curry
Saving that old cash, they vision blurry
They say who rhythm? who X? he ain't a pop group
But every time I look a wacker rapper drop troop
I funk styles, I make styles, freestyles
I pump styles, I write styles, see styles
I jack styles, prepare em then I hook em up
I'm ?rugged rug? with a pen, then a pad
I make emcees walk up, 'yo keith you bad
I'll give you my girl for every rhyme in the world'
One million, two million, three million, four
I move and take the money with his girl through the door

CRUSIN IN STYLE, I WANNA FLEX
(COLD PEEIN' ON EM)

Yo gimme a pound, Yo gimme a pound
Yo gimme a pound, yeah yeah, I know I'm down
I listen to old tapes, my favorite James Brown
Not an emcee bean, dropping bright stinky nights
Let me pee on the mike and wake em up with this style
Have the ladies on my tip, they know I'm sweaty style
I don't sing-sing, and jingle with jing-a-ling
Critics can look and zippy-zap, see my ding-a-ling
I write the rhymes your moms like, the rhymes your pops like
Then throw your tape out the window right?
They know the X is hype, they know the X is dope
They know the X is no joke
YEAH, yo put the crack down man, stop sniffing coke
I see my chauffeur is ready, the black rolls royce

CRUSIN IN STYLE, I WANNA FLEX
(COLD PEEIN' ON EM)Ahhh!

[Kool Keith]
I look at rappers with maximum equation
X-ray vision invasion
Rhyme connects perfects insects
That crawl and try to bite my rhymes
Pesticides, I'm the double D combine the T
That's DDT, a chemical more to better to burn
Roaches, germs, mouse, lice, termites, impecunious bugs
Or try thugs who perpetrate
Nothing within contaminate
Got my gloves on
So bring turtle doves on
Watch me pluck 'em and pick 'em
Stick 'em, kick 'em and vic 'em
I see you're featherless
You got the birdy disease
Bite any rhymes that I have for ya
The poison is bad for ya stupid
You're equal measure to dirt, dust, grime and puss
You're just a rappin' infection
Dirtilizin' my section like a six-legga
Ya betta step off and walk ya pure roach

(laughing)Boy, boy, crazy boy
Gotta rocket in my pocket [2x]

[Esham]
Maximum overdrive, how to stay alive
Jumpin' outta Lear jets no parachute, skydive
Fuck these niggas, I'm runnin' wit' a .45
I don't wanna be, ugh, I don't even wanna be alive
But if I gotta be NATAS, the hottest nigga wit' coatist
Bein' stated's what brought us, bloody up ya pradas
When I drag ya through the mud
Got love for guns, got love for slugs
Drugs, thugs wit' money turn ya rainy day sunny
The MDNA got my nose runny
Still runnin' up in this race
Runnin' against these racists
Treat ya like Joe Bruce wit' 2 faces
And I don't wanna be alive

(Chorus)
Boy, boy, crazy boy
Gotta rocket in my pocket
Boy, boy, crazy boy
Gotta rocket in my pocket
Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, I'mma
Dump, dump, I'mma dumb, I'mma dumb, I'mma dumb
Boy, boy, crazy boy
Gotta rocket in my pocket
Boy, boy, crazy boy
Gotta rocket in my pocket

[Kool Keith]
Ski masks in the back seat
I'm turning 6th street, you bout to feel heat
E on the Burrough street
Callin' cops in, Glocks in
Cocks in, niggas are blocked in
Moving out to Washington
Turn the siren down, clap with gun sound
Double lock, back up wit' the gun, clown
You walkin North but the sign say South bound
Ambulance, yo, yo, you bucked down
Man, move, yo, kid, you duck down
Fall in the foxhole, move dodger
Hot ya vest now, move a little farther
Giddy-up hoes, you get fucked though
My aim sharp so, .38 slug so
I duck shells when they scatter 'round the rugs though
I dump twicely, I dump nicely
Kid precisely, penetrate the wall so
When I'm also
Tech penetrate yo spray ya torso

(Chorus)(all vocals by Kool Keith)

Yo, I used to check out lyrics upon the formats
Built with skill with technique, computer ADAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought, flow, acrobat
Sync the track, pump the track
Dance missions clubs like spores react by strobe visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dance floor
Blowing up, and having mad people showing up
Packing crowds, jam packed venues
Needles collapse while atmosphere continues
Sprinkle that
Win it like that, move it like that, hitting like that
The melody is phat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss with Prodigy
Flipping astrology
My intellects devour
...with diesel power

Chorus:
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Repeat 3x

Win, spin back, rewind, diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
It has to be, automatically
Check it out, you'd better work it out
Change to another route
My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords to mics hanging like spring leaves
Doing tracks so fast, beyond the human eye
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
Es and pepped up, you get swept up
Smacked up, backed up
Your crew's all cracked up
Check it, slow pitch, who's quick, you can't stick
My metaphor range is strange as angles
You get tangled
Twist inside affections
Channels repeat, complete, can't be beat
Check the hour texture
Mind adventure, exploit the point
Into tracks to devour
My intellects proceed
...with diesel power

Chorus

Back attack the whack packs you faxing me
You don't want none, high quality action, be
Still standing, damaging your other manning
Quick reverse, potent as the first verse
My amplifier, blows on your world's higher
World sire, cuts like a barbed wire
Record player, I pull up on you everyday
Fast forward, I move and I swing toward
Exit load, put your brain in right mode
Select and mix
The man will perfect and fix
Heads lightly, bite me, copy, xerox, cock sand blocks
You can't knocks, I'm out there
Upbeat, lifting, shifting
Persistent intelligent kingpin
Flipping astrology, as I roll with Prodigy
...with diesel power

Chorus

Mono 7-0-6, 8-0-7-3

Robot-sonic

ChorusYeah girl
I've been checkin out Big Willie Keith
He been trickin a lot of bills on me
Mmm-hmm!
I think I'mma show him somethin tonight
A lap dance I would say
Yeah, that's what I'mma do
Yeahhhh..

[Kool Keith]
I'm like a freak from Hunt's Point, the Bronx and the Goat
Wear my drawers in tight mode, naked with no coat
Walkin around, I see youse about to lose her
That honey with white boots, and hair like Medusa
Brown-skin fine, I drink her body like wine
And throw the wax on it, and watch two cheeks shine
I drunk a forty, I'm up in here feelin naughty
I like the go-go girl, go 'head work it shorty
I got no time to trick, on the average girl
I'm in paradise, caught up, in the booty world
And for you regular honies, tryin to play fly
I ain't no Chemical no Bank in your human eye
I like my spot, everybody's butt naked
Pump with G-strings, watchin hot momma shake it
I got my beer, viewin from the back rear
Yo brotherman, pass it right over here
I got to ease off the stress, like a eight to five
Keepin it real vexed, them panties wanna get live
Change the pace up, yo Jimmy turn the bass up
Yea yeah yeahhhh

Chorus: Kool Keith + girl (repeat 2X)

Yo baby (whassup?)
Don't crush it when you sit upon it
(Yo baby) whassup?
(Don't rush it when I sit upon it)

[Kool Keith]
I see you scopin me, the fourth time you cut your eye
Let the brother to catch wreck, then tell the man goodbye
I'm next on the menu, runnin up and in you
With seven rubbers on me, don't try to discontinue
We gots to bump and grind, crank up the R. Kelly
Delicious kickin, no leather like I'm Fonzarelli
I order two drinks to think, while you show me pink
Summer Eve breeze and WOO when it don't stink
I'm in the mix, like Funky-master Flex
I'm shootin gizm, then after you can pick up next
I watch you shake it, like palm trees in California
Now you a lady, mature and I'm rubbin on ya
I got my Phantom mask, I'm on the dolo
I slipped in my tip in, and bone a sweetie look like Yo-Yo
She had a good time, knees bent in the chair
She said, "Get wild - I like it when you pull my hair"
I gave her cream, and rubbed it on her black boots
I see a packed house in different color body suits
I'm in the front row, chillin on the down low
Checkin her dogstyle, she's scoped by an ass pro
I'm from the back kid, smooth with tons of grease
Denver and Texas, and Cali on back to East
She hittin switches, and watch she make it lowride
Zoot, zoot, zzzzzzzt

Chorus 1.5X

[Kool Keith]
It's three o'clock, the morning shift's about to come
Watchin Goldie lapdance, that grey hiney ain't no slum
I gets my workout, my slickest hand from every angle
She's on the job right, cutiepie sippin Tango
I gotta peel for real, a hundred dollar bill
I'm comin straight up, and not for a breakfast meal
This ain't no Burger King, this ain't no White Castle
Not like some ugly girls in Bentleys tryin to give a hassle
I like the slot machine, bustin nuts mean
Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline
I'm pullin nylon, yo dead up G, to the side
Feelin soft flesh, I'm hard, I'mma let her ride
Jump up and down, get live like House of Pain
Leavin em so wet, the silk with a tan stain
I reach a climax, she's happy with her orgasms
Go on girl!

Chorus 2X[MF Doom/Viktor Vaughn]
People came from miles around to hear Vik rock it
He learned a few new styles since a two year old pick pocket
Kra-dow! Sad how sickenin
Now get retarded like mad cow kickin in
Yik! Chris wasn't trickin
And what's in the stew if the flu was in the chicken?
We all got our vices
Some got the gall, ta call the shots off the dices
And that's Vik, brings slaughter to your section
Have ya'll emcees get a order of protection
His name rings bell said Jake
He sings well, even with his king hell headache
Hit' em with a anvil, a trigger, a scandal
If not just to get free press off the Nigga Channel
He only plays for high prices
And rates his hourly rate based on how nice he is

[Kool Keith]
There's a lot of "I'll murder you" raps
With lame ass guys out of nowhere
Corny asses, I never heard of you cats
Guys like you mess up a lot of tracks
Ask your neighborhood about me
Why you rappin' act tough and grizzly
Urinate on your jacket and leave you pissy
Start jockin, get your autograph I'm missing
Defecate on your best line
Spit three verses in the cup and get busy
A wack ass comin this way
Must be cross eyed and dizzy
You don't listen enough, see me pissin enough
Leave ya yellow spots around your bed area
Defecate around your head area
Precise when I meet that ass
And greet that ass, the brain or what
Defecate on your apartment on Poinsettia

(Scratching'n'cutting until fade)[Kool Keith]
Hey, Dr. Octagon
You know how it is
When you're in the bathtub
I'm there, to give you the Oil of Olay
To rub it all over your head
Dr. Octagon, proctologyst, lyrical scientist
Women know my twist
When I release the hits
There's no one on the invitation guest list
Organic kilometer, you feel the temperature
Playing with the advisor
I take the advice, opposite Mr. Nice
Bone you twice we hear it
The funkology astrology
Lookin out the space window with the Bryants
I wear the Kobes
Not takin the space route, duplicate me
Like Moby, you don't know me

[Hook: singing]
Dr. Octagon
Dr. Octo
Dr. Octagon

[Kool Keith]
Operation X-Factor with the Wolverine
Walkin down Broadway with the X-Men
Women close your eyes
You see the green "Lost in Space" ship, count to 10
The first android landed from the Mercury
Nobody on Earth shock me
Your Earth music don't hurt me
We park the bus
... and grab the bags
Robot, me
Comin down the street
Dr. Smith and Will Robinson and Dawn
A baby chimpanzee with fur coat
Speed's older brother Racer X
Drinkin Dom P in the passenger seat

[Hook]

[Kool Keith]
With chemicals all over my pants
The discotheque won't let me in the dance
Original gas, computer built into my shoes
Reject the circumstance
A flying elephant with metal wings
Pulling up in Domino's
Me and Batman and the Rhino just left Spider-Man
Smokin PCP in the don room
With 2 Asian models, Aunt Bee, Barney Fife
Just a new distribution deal, with Jive
I got a new job workin in a band
With Elmer Fudd drivin a van
For the Channel 5 news, rouse

[Hook] w/ variations and ad libs to end(Back in the 70's, it was all about drugs..)

Tie my arm up at night between shows
Takin soda tops off of soda pops
I used to be up all night in the living room
Smokin a lot of weed with the Four Tops
Makin collect calls back home to my pops
My little brother said, "Keith - you need to stop!"
I knew something was wrong
When I gave away my VHS and sold a pair of my socks
The IRS callin me, gettin on my nerve, I was warned by Redd Foxx
My girl, "Keith you seen my diamond rings in the jewelry box?"
I don't know; last night you and Chaka Khan was in here sniffin blow
I was in the room sweatin thinkin about the rent playin bingo
The landlord said the first of the month, we gotta go
Packed up my bag and met Darryl Strawberry in the mall
I told James Brown stop smokin angel dust and the pis-tal
He wanted to go up to the Olive Garden and start a resteraunt brawl
"Mary J. Blige, my son don't accept them type of phone calls"
I can't come out tonight, my Bic lighter don't light
I heard you and K-Ci in the background
I'm screamin did the cops come and break up the fight?

All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs.. drugs..
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs..

Freebasin eighteen pounds of coke with Marvin Gaye
Put that on the table, let's parlay
With Smokey Robinson and Bootsy, lightin aluminum foil
Watch that crack pipe boil
With Richard Pryor we burned the house down gettin higher
Don't think I'm bluffin
Meet Tommy Lee Curtis, Keith Richards, Eddie Kingwards and David Ruffin
Rick James was in the kitchen lightin the flame
And Mousey's trapped with Cuba Gooding Sr
I don't want nobody to know my name
I kept glasses on it was a damn shame
Losin weight, fallin out in big arenas
The same guy who used to deal to me
Deals to Whitney and Bobby, meet Ike and Tina
Every Saturday mansions was packed, "Hey Jimmy you got the smack?"
Shut up! You don't know how to act

All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs.. drugs..
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs..

Crystal methane.. and heroin and quaaludes..
A relapse, of your mind
Angel dust, ecstasy, sniffin coke baby..
Got the best of me-heee-heeeee..
I got rits, withdrawals, my symptoms of pain
Rush me to the hosss-pi-tallll..
Oooh, ooh baby
Get this monkey off of MY MY MY BACK!
And get him off of me
Get the monkey off my BACK! Baby!
Get the monkey
And get the monkey off my back now..[Hook: Kool Keith]
Auto-tune is back
Got your girl, wanna come see the pro's
Durant & Westbrook
Auto-tune is back
Got your girl up on the dickhead
Sucking the dick now
Professional

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
I'm Durant & Westbrook, you came to help like fish
Because you sound like an unsure, insecure nigga
Bank off your mommy cheeks
Who hear the sneakers squeak
The New Jersey Nets watch me from the scout seats
LeBron called me to come be with the Heat
The organization showing me where I'll be living
A couple of Spanish girls looking on the balcony
With thongs from triple connected suites
The balance is good, J know I'm good for 500 million a year
Cause I stay young, looking like Ray Allen
Off with the mentioning the fat court
Show the rookies how to stop wearing the Citizen and the Seiko Quartz
Cum shot over the female rappers, Spike Lee amazed how I got the shot off
Girls order more hot dogs and pretz', make them run wet
Watch me undercover with Oakley specs
No doubt, auto-tune is back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Metropolis]
Yo, it's Metropolis
They call me grizzy-green, I'm playing position
Pass your 17-year-old daughter
Drink her little body with ice like a cold glass of water
There's no rookie that ever shook me
I'm the baker, the room was full of cookies
I'm in the rat race, confused in labyrinth, quit asking
Metrop' is know to flow with passion
Inspection of the rational
Don't confuse the grains thrown, insanity, that's mathematical
I sound like Rakim, you need tires screaming
My pants open, she's gagging while I'm flown on the Major Deegan
Metrop' is known, next exit is Jerome
You need to take this to the heart and strive
Play your body like Xbox Live
Introducing internet sex
A blunt and Henny and a 4-hour nut, then you next
Only fuck white chicks that's bisexual
I need their brain to be open-minded, intellectual
The street runner
Sexy dope fiends sucking dick, nodding off between two dumpsters

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool Keith]
They're using my past beats
Just to stay on the pants like a crease
Your dime like to get down on one knee
Holding a football for me to kick so smooth
I take a bath while she taking a shit
I'm the new building, New York's tallest
Woman gets soaking wet, panties drenched retarded
Pass off the cream, get comfortable, sleep inside your queen
Your family call me Steve Mc
100%, rappers want to get a fork and eat Steve shit
I know how to plant plants that come up through the horse manure
I gave them the ball, they looking around for an open man like Stuart
Your girl on her stomach with popsicles in her ass
She say I'm the coolest
Two lesbians, I don't mind getting sucked by two lips
Just as long as the one with the bald cap don't act like a man and hate

[Hook][Hook: Kool Keith]
The extra thought that count
Coming from Rocky Mount
Spaulding basketballs come out the sky
Which they bounce

The extra thought that count
That come from Rocky Mount
Spaulding basketballs come out the sky
Which they bounce

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Spirit of the golden Palestinian Indian
The formula's cold, you simian
I came from Peru on a choo-choo
To train to bring the goo coo-coo
Sit down and make it do what it do
To me, too many too many too many too many
Businessmen trying to be GQ
That's not the case
I spit on the main floor
They rap on B2
I'm all around
Translated the vocab
Coming male and Hebrew

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kool Keith]
Anything is possible
Maybe a couple of mil from the Paris government
Might make this a new world event
When other groups come and leave like Tastycakes
The flavor will still be there
Rhyme "soda" with "China"
Spitting phrases
You know I got two pair

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The I.M.O.]
Spaulding basketballs make no sound in the forest
I'm solo, around no crowd
No support
Where they claim they really heard my sound?
Illuminati cause I know them
Started off as one chosen deity's affection
I throw them 'bows to stomp em
I load them clips and pop one
The Yahtzi pee-pee
Dick in the bitches' butts
Still in the crates, but the bitches bring more bucks
I'm a pimp; bitch, where my cut?
Cuevo and champagne spilling out my cup
Walk with a strut; will ball, don't give a fuck
Handle the ball with a Iverson's touch
George that smush, still put em in a push
Spin the ball and ring the clutch

[Hook][Kool Keith]
Yeah
When I dunk across
When I show you the bowl
When I show you the floor
G-A-M-E, spells game

You know the bass is out, you ain't got game
I'm droppin words on beats, they come in thick game
The little flavor they use, they ain't got game
Long face or not, you be in the big game
Sweet on my feet, I float like Sugar Shane
You never get up the hill, on the Hall of Fame
E-40 my man, he did "Tha Hall of Game"
Players rock the stage, while the ballers bang
Pretty ladies they hang, while you droppin them thangs
Non-stop rocka rocka rocka
When I get up they spot me

[Hook]
G-A-M-E, spells game (since it started, I've been in it)
N-A-M-E, spells name (yeah that's me, don't forget it)
F-A-M-E, spells fame (whatever it takes, I'mma get it)
G-A-M-E, spells game (just pass me the rock, and watch me hit it)

[Kool Keith]
Peter Piper picked pickles, and Keith rocked rhymes
Move around get away you need to get game
In the pay game, give it up game
Still I flip a brain, in a powerful lane
Like a powerful train, you can't handle my pain
I put a stain on your name, leave you out in the rain
Let my photos remain, like the key yo
Stuck to a keychain
Nothin but the net from the 3, chang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang
Bobba-la-bang-bang
Shockin the ways, rockin them days
Sparkin 'em pays, yo!
Freeze, turn to 3's, on your knees
As free throws turn to bees

[Hook]

[Kool Keith]
Break down the basslines, girls check your hangtime
Double dribble and fizzle, humble and fumble
If you go out, let it all hang
And sweat like a freebird on the 6th man
Don't get jealous, stop messin with my good name
I'm out here with sharp arts and a booty aim
Watchin the hall of game
The big show, got me insane
Threes to burn leave you in flame
Like chargin a freight train
Little game, or big game
Who's runnin the blitz game?
Triple double game
30 to 8 game, don't be late mayne

[Hook][Hook]
Get it while you can

[Verse 1]
Now I'm activating my acrobats
I'm wearing a cast around my crutch on my tracks
You must want to see me in Cinemax, nigga
Come on baby, they're just a piece of gum in a pack
Arthur Baker, I make 'em pie crust
They want to walk up to another height
And step on a flight with a DC-10, motherfucker
Make yourself comfortable on my Airbus
My mechanics in the ceramics make your hair rust
Press the accelerator and drop up in your elevator
My Pinto's parked inside your neighbors
Parallel with lights blinking
Motherfucker, what the fuck you thinking?
Your head under the car, your ass see the oil leaking
You play Supernigga, why is the boiler leaking?
Rappers got they ass up in the air like Jada Stevens
The pimps backing out the door with my shit on the floor
With they Gators, leaving
I got the contract to jerk you
A lot of artists stuck in my hundred-year agreement
Emcees cry at night, "When you gon' release him?"
Eat all your food, I'm beasting
Chewing on metal pots
You might want to put on a peach bra
And walk away with combat boots
The Army don't want you in here with dreadlocks
The Marines say they can use a mascot
You girl ass so small she can sit in the dial of my watch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your bitch sucking the balls through my Batman jockstrap
I'mma let Robin double-team and put a finger in her asshole
She like when The Joker paint his face light green and unload
The Pengin coming with The Mad Hatter and Mr. Freeze
Now that's six of us squirting the cum in the face of one bitch
Girl, you're welcome
Superstar walking your Beverly Hills
Let us watch
Take out your weave and take a shit
I'm wearing goggles with windshield wipers
A lot of fog and rain when I'm in the studio producing shit
Thumbs-up in the cockpit
A bad bitch with a fucsia wig licking my dick
With my seatbelt fastened
I'm ready for takeoff, everything on autopilot
Piss on your Cazal glasses
Delta flight 88-80
Passengers lay back and shit on yourself
We about to fly over these stupid-ass niggas' heads real crazy
I'm still cumming in your girl's face through turbulence
Stewardess rocking back and forth in the cabin
Stay clear out the runway, you bastards

[Hook]Get off my elevator!
(Security will escort you out the building)
Get off my elevator!
(That woman is very nosey)

I choose my subjects, personal man, that's what I want to write
Critics critique, I compel that lots of rappers weak
'97 I blacked out, he's paying all my rent
Larger than hip-hop, you watch me like the president
No feedback on R&B scams motivate me
With stretch marks around your gut plus I know you hate me
Guard your feet, lose celulite, I'm a come complete
Work off your meat pounds with super sonic stomach sounds
That's word to hoss, animal heads, stupid fly gorilla
I get pros vexed, on ghetto clicks I get iller
Guard your rab mics, my style shine like zebra stripes
Right in your forehead, my word becomes a real missle
I be hanging in back doors like Rose's toilet tissue
Hydrolic engines blow flies out your left window
Your rap is catnip with slob dropping on the pillow
Shut your face, shut your mouth like pigeons floying south
I'm rolling rampart, the bottom kids where you start
Get off my two sacks, light your pipes, load your cracks

Get off my elevator!
(Security will escort you out the building)
Get off my elevator!
(That woman is nosey, trying to find out business)
Get off my elevator!
(Security will escort you out my building)
Get off my elevator!
(That woman is nosey, trying to find out more business)

You're rapping wackey, your whole wardrobe, your colored food stamps
Department of agriculture scheming like a vulture
I burn your sideburns off on tracks like John Shaft
You be counting your pubic hairs trying to do the math
Like mascot, you front your ashy face and black beat
Studio platic melts panties sweating street heat
I'll be there like Vladimir packing in your ear
Dr. Smith, Will Robinson make you say "Oh dear"
I take your tour bus, treat you like infested puss
Lima beans drop down and grease your dirty jeans
National thunderstorms, step up and find your power
Your records hot melt like yogurt and you smell sour
Get my reels, Ampex, a-DAT system flex
You got polio knees, lock fell on Soul Train
The anser is Anorex, punks I'll flip your brain
Like Don Cornelious, I hide behind the scenes
Make you lick my hot dogs with ketchup on two beans
I censorship real quick and feed your family cabbage
Make you thought eat ham hocks, tuna out the garbage
Blind your range with tones, your radio sounds strange
Eat out your rear bag, snatch ribs out your wild coyote
Tell Bob to pay me, the company boss still owe me
But Capitol built walls, built fences
I come for my check, don't lower your defenses

Get off my elevator!
(Security will escort you out my building)
Get off my elevator!
(You are very nosey and un-highclassed)
Get off my elevator!
(Security will definitely esort you away from my building)
Get off my elevator!
(You'll be shipped away in a cop car)

Elevation, I want elevation beyond elevation yes!
Elevation, elevation, past elevation
Elevation, elevators elevating elevation"All you care about is money. This town deserves a better class of criminal...and I'm going to give it to 'em."

Verse 1

Okay now, watch HelioS go
The god could save Ramadan without killing the goat
For the sons of guns who would steal the flow
He leaves them on the rag bleeding semen in bowls
So they’ll be male bitches who be on their flow
Obtaining sex switches to be sack-less hoes
Guitar kicks in as they slurp on their drinks
Till Sol InvictuS comes through, stomping on minks
And as they lay there whimpering, their ears start to bleed
Cause the animals stuck to their skin, they started to weep
Good riddance to bad seeds, their death was divined
Through their laggy ass lines, hacky sacky rhymes
Ran them rhymes ragged, muscling on my glow
Now they try to jog their memory cause I'm running the show
Hol' up, this ain't over: I've still got more to go!
Now if Life's a bitch, she must feel real amused
By these losers who claim to abuse her thinking the line is cool
Now, HelioS will rip shit to remind you tools
That giving into cliches is everything but cool

Chorus

[I see!] Pussies
[I see!]
Pussies
[I see!] Pussies

Verse 2

It took me all day to find this inspiration
To turn niggas inside out and call it innovation
And with that being said, keep that J. Cole in your head
While I load up the lead, cock it to explode on these dregs
With more originality out my ass, I'll make these present rappers past
Dismember half and leave the rest in casts...
And for the rest of those fucktards
This relaxing flow will buck hard
Better duck fast as my rhymes prepare to leave you in the junkyard
Better haul ass as I rip this beat
Disgracing dicks from my silky sheets
From lean rappers who can't stay on beat
To weed rappers who aren't worth my spit
Faded ass naggers, I'll watch you wear your ass out
'Fore I come through with the chariot to MOW YOUR ASS DOWN

Chorus

Verse 3

Call me Phoebus; I shine! Watch my light blind your eyes
Exposing your disguise, watch me stop your rise
It's a new age, a new day... The Reign of the Sun!
They thought I was joking when I said M.L.T was reborn
Oh, and for those eighties babies who say they be bored of rap
Tell them to re-introduce themselves, cause the god is back!

Chorus

"EVERYTHING BURNS! It's not about money...it's about sending a message."
