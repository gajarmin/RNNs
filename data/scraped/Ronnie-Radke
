[Intro]
A man convicted of battery is on the run tonight
Ronald Radke, was found guilty for his role in the death of 18 year old *censored*
Falling In Reverse and former Escape The Fate vocalist, Ronnie Radke was arrested in Glendale, CA in an alleged domestic dispute with his girlfriend
The leader singer of that band got a little wild and crazy
This is near where the shooting happened more than two years ago

[Verse 1]
I got an insane posse, we ain't clowns though
I ain't a juggalo buddy, I was fucking Juggal-hoes
Yeah, maybe it's in my nature cause I never wanna date her
But she's like a shot of vodka cause I always gotta chaser
What's the fucking problem with a one night stand?
I'm never gonna settle down, you need to understand
And let me keep it simple I'm officially stable, and I won't miss you, here's some tissue, I got issues, believe me
And I always see my mommy in every woman I meet (why?)
Well I hate my fucking mother, motherfucker it's weak (fuck you)
So please believe me I'm a needy, insecure fucking freak
And it ain't easy or as dreamy as you thought it would be (check it)
Took her out to dinner (yeah), went and tried to kiss her (okay), opened up my eyes the fuckin' bitch was checking Twitter (what?)
Ladies, I ain't tryin' to be rude but, I'll never date a bitch who Instagrams her fucking food (eww)

[Hook: Andy Biersack]
Oh, I lost my fucking mind
It happens all the time
Cause I can't stand myself, I'm an asshole, baby
Oh, I'm fashionably late
I'm the one you love to hate
Cause I can't stand myself, cause I'm an asshole, baby

[Verse 2]
I was up in the scene in mid-2006
I was automatically labeled as a goddamn prick
I go to prison and get out and then I'm back at it
I ain't afraid to go back, better watch that lip
But the music nowadays always sound the same
But it's pretty fucking lame what you fucking lames claim to be real music
And you gotta feel stupid to be still choosin' to abuse the privilege, and you still use it?
Lately all you bands do the same damn shit, same breakdowns, snare, kick, and lame ass riff
And everybody still fucking the same lame damn bitch, that comes to every show, showing her fake ass tits
But not me, I'm on a whole other planet
And I'll be damned if I sit back and let this fucking shit happen
I'm an assassin, with that music and fashion
When I cash out, no back tracks, I stack racks, I cashed in

[Hook]
[Skit: Ronnie and Andy]
Alright everybody on the fucking ground right now
Andy, here. (Alright)
You all are going to fucking die
Fuck you, fuck your tweets, fuck everything about you
Social media, my fucking ass
*Shooting and laughing*
I'm an asshole, baby

[Verse 3]
Last but not least, I wanna thank my fans
The best damn fan base a band could have
To show appreciation for how grateful I am, here's a mic stand, take it home to your dad
I got arrested for a crime that I didn't commit
And I never beat my girlfriend, she's a goddamn bitch man
The truth is she was pissed I broke it off, so what she did was calculate a plan to hurt me any chance she could get (damn)
Fuck it, her plot didn't work (nope)
The jig is up and everybody knows it's berserk
All you tough guys and wise guys, gangsters on that WiFi, are bitch made in your real life, in real life, I will fight
And just because I rock them skinny jeans and a belt, don't mean shit motherfucker I'll knock your ass out for real
Cause I'm pissed off, I'll piss on anybody cause I spit raw
I split jaws, I'm hip hop, I'll Nicholas Cage your face off

[Hook][x2]

[Outro: Ronnie and Andy]
Welcome to the fucking mixtape, 2014 and beyond
Me, Ronnie Radke and a whole bunch of other crazy mother fuckers (Andy Biersack, haha)
You don't like it go fuck yourself *laughs*
Now kids, it's just a fucking joke. Relax[Hook: Deuce]
Nobody likes me, no one likes me
But I don't like them
Uh huh, I don't, nu uh
Nobody likes me, no one likes me
Why? Cause I don't like them
Uh huh, I don't, nu uh

[Verse 1: Deuce]
All this hate you gave me, it turned me deranged
Now I'm burning in the flames
All the things you said, they've been stuck in my head
And now I'm at it again, an addict
Welcome to hell bitch, you can't do nothing about it
Out of my way faggot, you heard what I said damnit
I am an automatic ready to fire back at all the fuckers laughing
Not gonna lie, I've had it, I'm gonna wreck havoc
Everyone's dying, don't matter

[Pre-Hook]
This is my chance, maybe my last
And if I leave there's no way back
This is your fate when worlds collapse
I took my pain now give it back

[Truth]
I give it back, give it back
Only one of us will laugh last
(Now give it back...)
I give it back, give it back
Break this whole fucking world in half

[Hook]

[Bridge: Deuce & Ronnie Radke]
I used to have so many friends
I thought I could trust
But when it came to saving me
You let me self-destruct

[Verse 2: Ronnie Radke]
Well I'm back now, I'm seeking out this vengeance
Not to mention that this black cloud, it sticks around
And visits my intuition, won't let me back down
And I swear to God, my heart is like a piston
Pumping rage into this engine, turn the keys to my ignition
Listen, nobody likes me
It's enlightening, it excites me
And I talk this shit with the lyrics I spit
And still nobody will fight me
Try walking a mile in my shoes and get beat with your own Nikes
I'm a grimey motherfucker with a mic, so call me Mickey
I got no patience lately for these fucking faggots faking
Making lies up, wise up
And if you really think you can take me
Wake me up from this lazy battle
Rattle you with my crazy battle
Pay my dues back on the saddle
The lonely road that I slowly travel

[Pre-Hook]
[Deuce]
This is my chance
Maybe my last
And if I leave
There's no way back
This is your fate
When worlds collapse
I took my pain
Now give it back

[Truth]
I give it back, give it back
Only one of us will laugh last
(Now give it back...)
I give it back, give it back
Break this whole fucking world in half
(Break this world in half!)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You thought you figured it out
You thought you figured it out
Uh huh, you thought you figured it out
You thought you... figured me out!
You'll never figure me out!
You can't figure me out!
Shut the fuck up!
I'll burn you fuckers down!
I know you're proud
I held my ground
Time's running out
You hear the crowd
They know you're down
Time's running out

[Hook]

[2x]
Now it's much too late
To say you're sorry
Don't care what you think
Uh huh, I don't, nu uh[Hook]
I'm already dead
Uh, I wasted time
I'm already gone, uh
Said goodbye
Will we be the only one
Sulkin' in the sun
Takin' it slowly?
And, if I'm not your only one
Then I'm done bein' your soulmate, ahh

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my world; a big ball of stress
Nevertheless, I am dressed for the occasion
Situation's complicated, I guess
Yes, it's all a mess
Everybody's always up in my shit
Bitches trip, throwin' shit like a gymnast
And friendships end over shit, like I'm sea sick
Shit, is it somethin' I said?
Somethin' I did? Is it all in my head?
Why does this happen to happen to me?
Why can't I always be happy instead?
The only time I'm great's when I'm on the stage
Gettin' praise, ragin' like a beast trapped in a cage
Gettin' torn up with a raw stick-slap in the face
Goin' ape shit on the world, like I'm Planet of the Apes
And I know, and I know
And I know our own life
This won't be forever
But I will, but I will
But I will survive...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my hell; where no one should be
The place I go every time I'm on the phone
With my baby mama screamin' at me
And this shit sucks, and I wanna give up
But I can't, and I won't
When the goin' gets tough
And it cuts to the core, like I sword to the gut
So I shove my feelings to the floor, and I run
Fuck, it's time to go
Yellin' and screamin', you know how it goes
I'm always leavin', you blow up my phone
I'm tired of fighting and losing control
Damn, I'm a dad
I never said I'd make a good one, it's sad
It truly bothers I can't be a father
Because you hate me so much, I can't stand
And I know, and I know
And I know our own life
This won't be forever
But I will, but I will
But I will survive...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If I'm supposed to be 'that man'
And I'm supposed to be 'that guy'
Then why the fuck am I stuck in a rut?
I'm a schmuck, motherfucker, and I should try
Huh? I should die?...
Bitch, and you wonder why
I never call it right, cause I'm always on the opposite side of the phone gettin' the dial tone vibe
Alright, I admit it
I got a vice, I get it
I'ma use a woman as a object, it's a problem
A continent's worth of honest livin'
I can't help it, though
It's in my face at every show
With the combination bein' raised in a place
When every woman bounced, just the way it goes
(Just the way it goes...) [x9]

[Outro]
Will we be the only one? (One, one, o-one)
(What?)
Just the way..
Will we be the only one, one?
Just the way..
(Yeah, it's just the way it goes)
Just the way it goes [x3]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just the way it goes)
Just the way it goes, just the way it--Uh!...Ronnie Radke - Blacklist (feat. B.Lay)

B. Lay.:

Shout out to my motherfucking friends, all we do is win
Shout out to my homies in the pen doing ten
Shout out to my motherfucking hoes all across the globe, pretty girls love me every where I go

Ronnie:

I got that double r, that stands for rapping and rocking
I got them battle scars I brush it off and keep walking
I've been to hell, every level, sold my soul to the devil
But this music's theraputic, it's what keeps me together

I'm never gonna slack, motherfucker gonna get it
You rat motherfuckers always snitchin'
If anybody gotta problem cause I'm good at bein' honest when I started from the motherfucking bottom?
I never wanna miss my chance again, I'm stackin' all my chips every chance I get
Cause I'm back to the motherfucking lab with a mad rap on a fast track with a pad and a pen

Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Never settle for lesser in life you feelin' my vibe?

Ha ha

Yeah they put me on my knees
Yeah they taught me how the fuck to think

This is how you made me America, this is how you change me America
I am on your black list America
(Re)member beyond, beyond the mask there is a man

B. Lay.:

Look so follow me all of me as I marvel in this life
So many people want the fame; Fuck that! - Fuck that!
I fucked with a ouija board at least three lords
You can say I'm about that life, nigga
When it comes to my team I'm a bleed for them when they bleed for me, nigga
Cash mixed with stash in the backpack on the 'ave' 'till after dark, nigga
Raps in the back half, snows in the front half, it's blowing my mind, nigga
Who knew in a few moons my first tattoo would have rung true
No sympathy for the dead when I ETF, my destiny came true, nigga

Ronnie:

Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Never settle for lesser in life you feelin' my vibe?

Ha ha

Yeah they put me on my knees

Say it again & again; beyond, beyond, beyond the mask, there is a man
This is how you made me America, this is how you change me America
I am on your black list America
(Re)member beyond, beyond the mask there is a man

Don't push me motherfucker, I got that game on lock
Hip hop with a little bit of rollin' rock
I gotta get every itty bitty tid bit of every penny 'till the motherfuckin' day the music stops
Gold, motherfucker, from coast to coast
Got alot of fucking passion, I be killin' the flow
Ain't nobody hotter, gonna burn up like I'm sauter, cauterize the fuckin game like I go for broke

B. Lay.:

*cough cough*

As I choke on smoke, pulled a gat on a nigga feeling overdose for raping my mother in his overcoat
It's never over-bro 'till your soul's exposed

Ronnie:

Cha-ching, Oh. Sick & twisted
Killing little bitches like I'm Mr. Vicious
Leave you in a motherfucking sack with a black mask and a red cap, motherfucker, limp bizkit

Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Right fuck you, you feelin' my vi-vi-vi vibe?

This is how you made me America, this is how you change me America
I am on your black list America
I am on your black list America[Verse 1]
There ain't no heaven, only hell
We all got devils, stories to tell
Mine are scary, no light ahead
The monsters are livin' under your bed, they're the voices in your head
You best play dead, that's what I heard them say
As I fell to my knees to pray
But if heaven is a joke and god is a lie
Then I'm praying to something fake
I'm so sick of it
Tired of this, sick and tired of being tired and sick
Stick to the plan inspire and spit
Like a wick to a candle, ignite that shit
In the dead of night, lightning struck
Kickin' up dust like a pickup truck
I'm a ticking time bomb with sublime on
Looking for a piece of paper to write on
My mom, left me as a baby in a house with the lights off
All night long is the reason I write songs
I was eight months, now I'm famous
Glad I made it, irony ain't it?

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah
Glad I made it
Glad I made it
Glad I made it
Heading to hell
It's irony ain't it?
Glad I made it
Glad I made it
Heading to Hell
It's irony ain't it?

[Hook]
I'm never gonna know, if I, would of made it, alive
I would of never known, that I, could fly
Oh we will never know, that you, would of made me into, the person that I am
I will never stop
I will never stop
I will never stop

[Verse 2]
Dark skies have followed, me around
The rain won't stop, man I hate this town
And if I shall die, before I wake
I'm praying that the lord will take my soul
But I don't got no soul to take
I've made mistakes and I've felt that weight
Put a little too much on my plate
To the point where the plate has cracked, but never in fact would I let it break
Them pearly gates are never gonna open
Never gonna give a warm embrace
But at least I tried, and on the day that I die, my headstones gonna say...
God forgives, but not me
Too many sins, no apologies
Headed to hell on a highway
M.I.A, on a motherfucking Friday, such a nice day to fly away
Got the world in my palm as I drop straight

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I can't believe, I'm still alive
I've seen some things, I've seen the light
Close to death, and god's a myth?
The greatest trick that the devil ever told was proving that he don't exist
And the older I get, the more that the fate consists
Of sitting up on this fence
Between pain and bliss, where the pain exists with the happiness I missed
My final wish, I'm really hoping that I get, cause my last two would conflict
So I'm rubbing this lamp till my hand gets cramped and the genie pops out of it
You think I act tough?
Because I've been cuffed?
Did a couple push-up's stuck in jail
Man I've been this way since 2nd grade, motherfucker this shit is real
I can get you killed
In the blink of an eye man
I can, show you another side of the violence
Try it
I'm a motherfucking lion, bitin'
Anybody coming near me is dying

[Bridge]
Yeah
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Heading to hell
It's irony ain't it?
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Heading to Hell
It's irony ain't it? Irony ain't it? Irony ain't it?
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Heading to hell
It's irony ain't it?
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Heading to hell
It's irony ain't it?

[Hook][Verse 1]
My Destiny was large
From the day I picked up the mic it was written in the stars
The day that I was born my father knew and he held  me in his arms
Looked into my eyes
I sang my first melody, it came out as a cry
Thirty years have past and for the very first time I realized
I pour my life into every single line
I write until I die
And I've arrived In a place where I am fine
Cause 27 years ago I learned how to survive
Why my fucking mother left and dad was always high
The powers never on the bill was never on time
But I somehow learned to shine
Through the darkest nights I found the will to stay alive
Now every time you see me you gotta look up to the sky
The story of a boy who showed the world that he can fly, but I

[Hook]
And it's nice to know that I've made it home
But it's safe to say that I'm all alone
So here I go, here I am, without you, without them
But it's nice to know that I've made it home
I made it home, I made it home

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry dad I never meant to hurt you anyway
Watching me running from police up on the free way
I bet you never thought I'd end up on the news
Headline read: "accused murderer on the loose"
Dude, that's something I'd never do
The skewed view of the news leaving out the fucking truth
Of what actually happened God damn it, it was what I had to do
Defendin' friend's honor but I refuse to lose
So I choose abuse as a muse
Interrogation room but I refuse to spew any information too
I'm a mute and I will use my right to remain booed
I will never talk to red and blue to a jail cell I was due
I had to eat their fucking soup
Look over my shoulder every time I eat my food
Praying for the day that they would let me out soon
Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll do

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Climbed so many mountains in my life
I've come to realize if I fight
I've climbed so many mountains in my life
I've come to realize I will fight

[Verse 3]
This goes out to any kid that's listening and dwindling away from the world
Curled up in a ball and then distancing themselves
Because they feel like everyone's out to hurt them
I'm here to help with this burden
I am not perfect but I'm learning to be better
So if I can help a kid that's in a struggle that juggles
With his troubles to break out of his fucking bubble
Remove the fucking muzzle hustle out of the rubble
Put the pieces back to the puzzle even if it's subtle I'm humbled
I'm not as bad as you think I'm begging and pleading for you to believe me it stinks
That everyone around me thinks that I'm a fucking machine without a heart beat
But contrary to popular belief I've got a heart in this chest
And all I want is the best for everybody but it's hard when I obsess over stress
Anxiety stricken flashing visions of prison that I suppress
My hands start shaking over my quickness of breath
Cold sweat no regrets though it's time to fucking let go
Of all the pain I've harbored I am better I will revel
In the thought of leaving put my peddle to the metal
People I will let know sold my soul back from the devil
I will no longer eat your soup
Or look over my shoulder every time I eat my food
Cause today is the day you will let me go too
Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll do

[Hook] [x2][Hook: Deuce]
Who can stop us now?
While the whole world bows
Watch us share this crown
Every time you step in, we push you out
Who can stop us now?
While the whole world bows
Try and bring us down
Every time we step in, we push you out

[Verse 1: Ronnie Radke]
I rock hard, (no sleep)
Marriage, (not me)
My shoe game is so cold, see
Two reasons I got cold feet
And friendship is important
My gear is all imported
Deuce is on my chorus
Me and B.Lay gonna get that Forbes List
And I'm gonna straight roll to each state though
Gonna make a fuckin' killing on a bank roll
And can't ya see that I will compete
With any other rapper in the game, bro?
And I got this, cause I'm a locksmith
Got the game on lock
In a hot minute, and I'mma lose my cool
When I step up in the booth
'Bout to lose a tooth, cause I'm flossing
No oxygen bitch, I'm a glitch away
When I flip this motherfucker I got shit to say
Be cautious bitch I'm a twitch away
From snappin' on another fuckin' bitch today
Cause I'mma bench the weight
And I'mma get the cake
If anybody got a problem, I could demonstrate
To definition of a sauna, hotter than the summer
Park it undercover
I'ma beat the case of record
Trailer gonna, gonna, gun it like a gunner, put my foot up on the pedal to the metal, motherfucker
I'm a runner, and you wonder how I came up from the gutter
With a scalpel and a son of fuck
I swear I'm a part of ya'll on another level
I got turn up, gonna kill 'em with the thunder, motherfuckers gettin' dumber
Fuck you plumbers, suckin' shit up like a plunger
Everybody's got a problem, check it bubber
Anybody wanna solve it?
Get my number, fuck you harder
I'ma gut you like a motherfuckin' Glock

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.Lay]
Born to win, most my niggas were born to sin, I'm born again
Rock with the pistol, all christian
I'll cross you out for steppin' in, with my crew
What it do?
Sup, dude?
Wit crew eyes
And new 2 Pac in the boondocks
I'm never givin' in to your rude thoughts
And I'm bangin' like a motherfuckin' boombox
Since age of two
Lookin' outside, seein' red and blue
With a sue, woo-hoo
And a goo-goo twos
And my coo-coo moon, so who are you to question?
Never hung 'round niggas that gang bang
Let their pants hang, do their damn thang
Let the pistol bang, and the booty sang
Gets past the jail with the booty train
So who's gonna stop me now?
Huh?
I rose from the ghetto to a different level
The motherfuckin' Devil won a hell of a hell hold
If Hell froze, (Hell nah)
Come walk in my shoes, see a different view
Want with your shoes
To be another motherfuckin' stat in the news
I planned it, boo
And you wonder why all my niggas like fancy jewels, baggy pants, and flashy shoes?
Been bobbin' the source and passin' dudes
I'm a fashion dude
I'm dat nigga doe
And my new back, and my new swag
And my new snap in that game
Yeah, I'm dat new, nigga' dat rain

Cause I can't stand myself, cause I'm an asshole, baby

[Verse 2]
I was up in the scene in mid-2006
I was automatically labeled as a goddamn prick
I go to prison and get out and then I'm back at it
I ain't afraid to go back, better watch that lip
But the music nowadays always sound the same
But it's pretty fucking lame what you fucking lames claim to be real music
And you gotta feel stupid to be still choosin' to abuse the privilege, and you still use it?
Lately all you bands do the same damn shit, same breakdowns, snare, kick, and lame ass riff
And everybody still fucking the same lame damn bitch, that comes to every show, showing her fake ass tits
But not me, I'm on a whole other planet
And I'll be damned if I sit back and let this fucking shit happen
I'm an assassin, with that music and fashion
When I cash out, no back tracks, I stack racks, I cashed in

[Hook]
[Skit: Ronnie and Andy]
Alright everybody on the fucking ground right now
Andy, here. (Alright)
You all are going to fucking die
Fuck you, fuck your tweets, fuck everything about you
Social media, my fucking ass
*Shooting and laughing*
I'm an asshole, baby

[Verse 3]
Last but not least, I wanna thank my fans
The best damn fan base a band could have
To show appreciation for how grateful I am, here's a mic stand, take it home to your dad
I got arrested for a crime that I didn't commit
And I never beat my girlfriend, she's a goddamn bitch man
The truth is she was pissed I broke it off, so what she did was calculate a plan to hurt me any chance she could get (damn)
Fuck it, her plot didn't work (nope)
The jig is up and everybody knows it's berserk
All you tough guys and wise guys, gangsters on that WiFi, are bitch made in your real life, in real life, I will fight
And just because I rock them skinny jeans and a belt, don't mean shit motherfucker I'll knock your ass out for real
Cause I'm pissed off, I'll piss on anybody cause I spit raw
I split jaws, I'm hip hop, I'll Nicholas Cage your face off

[Hook][x2]

[Outro: Ronnie and Andy]
Welcome to the fucking mixtape, 2014 and beyond
Me, Ronnie Radke and a whole bunch of other crazy mother fuckers (Andy Biersack, haha)
You don't like it go fuck yourself *laughs*
Now kids, it's just a fucking joke. RelaxRonnie Radke - Blacklist (feat. B.Lay)

B. Lay.:

Shout out to my motherfucking hoes all across the globe, pretty girls love me every where I go

Ronnie:

I got that double r, that stands for rapping and rocking
I got them battle scars I brush it off and keep walking
I've been to hell, every level, sold my soul to the devil
But this music's theraputic, it's what keeps me together

I'm never gonna slack, motherfucker gonna get it
You rat motherfuckers always snitchin'
If anybody gotta problem cause I'm good at bein' honest when I started from the motherfucking bottom?
I never wanna miss my chance again, I'm stackin' all my chips every chance I get
Cause I'm back to the motherfucking lab with a mad rap on a fast track with a pad and a pen

Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Never settle for lesser in life you feelin' my vibe?

Ha ha

Yeah they put me on my knees

This is how you made me America, this is how you change me America
I am on your black list America
(Re)member beyond, beyond the mask there is a man

B. Lay.:

Look so follow me all of me as I marvel in this life
So many people want the fame; Fuck that! - Fuck that!
I fucked with a ouija board at least three lords
You can say I'm about that life, nigga
When it comes to my team I'm a bleed for them when they bleed for me, nigga
Cash mixed with stash in the backpack on the 'ave' 'till after dark, nigga
Raps in the back half, snows in the front half, it's blowing my mind, nigga
Who knew in a few moons my first tattoo would have rung true
No sympathy for the dead when I ETF, my destiny came true, nigga

Ronnie:

Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Never settle for lesser in life you feelin' my vibe?

Ha ha

I am on your black list America
(Re)member beyond, beyond the mask there is a man

Don't push me motherfucker, I got that game on lock
Hip hop with a little bit of rollin' rock
I gotta get every itty bitty tid bit of every penny 'till the motherfuckin' day the music stops
Gold, motherfucker, from coast to coast
Got alot of fucking passion, I be killin' the flow
Ain't nobody hotter, gonna burn up like I'm sauter, cauterize the fuckin game like I go for broke

B. Lay.:

*cough cough*

As I choke on smoke, pulled a gat on a nigga feeling overdose for raping my mother in his overcoat
It's never over-bro 'till your soul's exposed

Ronnie:

Cha-ching, Oh. Sick & twisted
Killing little bitches like I'm Mr. Vicious
Leave you in a motherfucking sack with a black mask and a red cap, motherfucker, limp bizkit

Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Right fuck you, you feelin' my vi-vi-vi vibe?

Ha ha

Yeah they put me on my knees
Yeah they taught me how the fuck to think
Say it again & again; beyond, beyond, beyond the mask, there is a man

Yeah they put me on my knees

Say it again & again; beyond, beyond, beyond the mask, there is a man
This is how you made me America, this is how you change me America
I am on your black list America
I am on your black list America[Verse 1]
My Destiny was large
From the day I picked up the mic it was written in the stars
The day that I was born my father knew and he held  me in his arms
Looked into my eyes
I sang my first melody, it came out as a cry
Thirty years have past and for the very first time I realized
I pour my life into every single line
I write until I die
And I've arrived In a place where I am fine
Cause 27 years ago I learned how to survive
Why my fucking mother left and dad was always high
The powers never on the bill was never on time
But I somehow learned to shine
Through the darkest nights I found the will to stay alive
Now every time you see me you gotta look up to the sky
The story of a boy who showed the world that he can fly, but I

[Hook]
And it's nice to know that I've made it home
But it's safe to say that I'm all alone
So here I go, here I am, without you, without them
But it's nice to know that I've made it home
I made it home, I made it home

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry dad I never meant to hurt you anyway
Watching me running from police up on the free way
I bet you never thought I'd end up on the news
Headline read: "accused murderer on the loose"
Dude, that's something I'd never do
The skewed view of the news leaving out the fucking truth
Of what actually happened God damn it, it was what I had to do
Defendin' friend's honor but I refuse to lose
So I choose abuse as a muse
Interrogation room but I refuse to spew any information too
I'm a mute and I will use my right to remain booed
I will never talk to red and blue to a jail cell I was due
I had to eat their fucking soup
Look over my shoulder every time I eat my food
Praying for the day that they would let me out soon
Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll do

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Climbed so many mountains in my life
I've come to realize if I fight
I've climbed so many mountains in my life
I've come to realize I will fight

[Verse 3]
This goes out to any kid that's listening and dwindling away from the world
Curled up in a ball and then distancing themselves
Because they feel like everyone's out to hurt them
I'm here to help with this burden
I am not perfect but I'm learning to be better
So if I can help a kid that's in a struggle that juggles
With his troubles to break out of his fucking bubble
Remove the fucking muzzle hustle out of the rubble
Put the pieces back to the puzzle even if it's subtle I'm humbled
I'm not as bad as you think I'm begging and pleading for you to believe me it stinks
That everyone around me thinks that I'm a fucking machine without a heart beat
But contrary to popular belief I've got a heart in this chest
And all I want is the best for everybody but it's hard when I obsess over stress
Anxiety stricken flashing visions of prison that I suppress
My hands start shaking over my quickness of breath
Cold sweat no regrets though it's time to fucking let go
Of all the pain I've harbored I am better I will revel
In the thought of leaving put my peddle to the metal
People I will let know sold my soul back from the devil
I will no longer eat your soup
Or look over my shoulder every time I eat my food
Cause today is the day you will let me go too
Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll do

[Hook] [x2][Verse 1]
There ain't no heaven, only hell
We all got devils, stories to tell
Mine are scary, no light ahead
The monsters are livin' under your bed, they're the voices in your head
You best play dead, that's what I heard them say
As I fell to my knees to pray
But if heaven is a joke and god is a lie
Then I'm praying to something fake
I'm so sick of it
Tired of this, sick and tired of being tired and sick
Stick to the plan inspire and spit
Like a wick to a candle, ignite that shit
In the dead of night, lightning struck
Kickin' up dust like a pickup truck
I'm a ticking time bomb with sublime on
Looking for a piece of paper to write on
My mom, left me as a baby in a house with the lights off
All night long is the reason I write songs
I was eight months, now I'm famous
Glad I made it, irony ain't it?

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah
Glad I made it
Glad I made it
Glad I made it
Heading to hell
It's irony ain't it?
Glad I made it
Glad I made it
Heading to Hell
It's irony ain't it?

[Hook]
I'm never gonna know, if I, would of made it, alive
I would of never known, that I, could fly
Oh we will never know, that you, would of made me into, the person that I am
I will never stop
I will never stop
I will never stop

[Verse 2]
Dark skies have followed, me around
The rain won't stop, man I hate this town
And if I shall die, before I wake
I'm praying that the lord will take my soul
But I don't got no soul to take
I've made mistakes and I've felt that weight
Put a little too much on my plate
To the point where the plate has cracked, but never in fact would I let it break
Them pearly gates are never gonna open
Never gonna give a warm embrace
But at least I tried, and on the day that I die, my headstones gonna say...
God forgives, but not me
Too many sins, no apologies
Headed to hell on a highway
M.I.A, on a motherfucking Friday, such a nice day to fly away
Got the world in my palm as I drop straight

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I can't believe, I'm still alive
I've seen some things, I've seen the light
Close to death, and god's a myth?
The greatest trick that the devil ever told was proving that he don't exist
And the older I get, the more that the fate consists
Of sitting up on this fence
Between pain and bliss, where the pain exists with the happiness I missed
My final wish, I'm really hoping that I get, cause my last two would conflict
So I'm rubbing this lamp till my hand gets cramped and the genie pops out of it
You think I act tough?
Because I've been cuffed?
Did a couple push-up's stuck in jail
Man I've been this way since 2nd grade, motherfucker this shit is real
I can get you killed
In the blink of an eye man
I can, show you another side of the violence
Try it
I'm a motherfucking lion, bitin'
Anybody coming near me is dying

[Bridge]
Yeah
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Heading to hell
It's irony ain't it?
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Heading to Hell
It's irony ain't it? Irony ain't it? Irony ain't it?
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Heading to hell
It's irony ain't it?
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Glad we made it
Heading to hell
It's irony ain't it?

[Hook][Verse 1: Ronnie Radke]
If I was granted one wish
It would be for you to see me
For who I really am
Because these looks can be deceiving
And I swear to god
If you really listen closely
By the time this song is over
You will truly know me

Cause I am not a monster
I am just a man
And I'm getting sick and fuckin' tired
Of these fans
That expect me to be some perfect version
Of a fuckin' person
And it's hurtful
I feel worthless
I just wanna feel I'm worth it

And it's hard
But I'm learning to be honest
And discerning
And I am gaining all my courage
To be better
I am searching
(damn)

But it's so damn hard
To keep it calm when
Everything I've known
Is broken and scarred
And I'm not trying to complain
About my problems at all
Because my problems
Are the reason I have gotten this far
So I am thankful for adversity
And makin' me strong
I'm just trying to explain
How I feel in a song
It goes

[Hook]

Oh
I really can't believe that
I'm really here right now
I'm hanging on an airplane
Floating through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh
I never ever want to touch the ground
I'm walkin' on a tight rope
Searching for the right note
Play that sound

[Verse 2:]
Let's take it back to '92 when I was eight
My brother gave me a tape
By mistake
Dr. Dre
It was December 15th to the date
(let me ride)
The Chronic
On my birthday
Must have been fate

Now let's flash forward
To the first time in '99
When I heard Shady on the radio
And to my surprise
That this is really happenin'
A white boy is rappin'
From the bottom to the top
That motherfucker made it happen

So I grabbed a pen and pad
And started writin' down madness
Later joined a band
And wrote my songs around my sadness
Formulated all my tragic moments into magic
Now I'm sellin' tickets to my shows and
Have 'em packed in

You best believe it
Cause I'm tellin the truth
I bought a motherfuckin' caddy
And a house with a view
Don't need to prove that I'm amazin'
And I'm keepin' it true
So before you try and hate me
Try to walk in my shoes
It goes

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
And after all that I've been through
I can say I've made it
Through the fuckin' bullshit
To the other side safely
I can truly say I can feel myself changing
Into a better person
Don't give a fuck if you can hate me
Never gonna let you take me down
That path I'm used to taking
And I know that in my heart of hearts
The problems that I'm facing
Is in half the battle that I'm fighting
Energy I'm wasting
I'm so sick of these fuckin' bitches
Always changing what I'm saying
Into something that it's not
Man this shit has got to stop
Shit I'll wear the clothes I want
And I'll cut my hair all off
And I'll do it just to prove
That I'm a motherfuckin boss
And my music keeps me movin'
And I will not slow or pause
I'd like to think that I'm a-okay
And all my worries are so foolish
And will fade away
One day I'd like to think that
I'll face my fate
And my legacy lives on
You'll remember my name
And it goes

Oh
I really can't believe that
I'm really here right now
I'm hanging on an airplane
Floating through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh
I never ever want to touch the ground
I'm walkin' on a tight rope
Searching for the right note
Play that sound[RONNIE RADKE]:

You guys didn't think I was gonna say something, did you?
Well guess what... Haha...
I'm about to expose you punk motherfuckers right now
Sumerian Records, I See Stars and Lorenzo The Main Event, you punk pussy!

Motherfucking I See Stars? More like I Wash Cars
Cause I'm about to end your career in just 16 bars
Actually you never had a fucking band from the start
So it's kind of hard to start something that never had heart
You fucking fake phonies popping slander off my name
Trying to make my fans believe all the lies you claim
I never stole a dime from you that's the goddamn truth
You guys dropped off the tour cause your plan fell through
Yeah deny it motherfuckers but I got proof
You fucking punk pussies forgot about the emails you slew at me
Haphazardly asking for a second chance
But actually secretly planning to have fans come to the shows chanting

I Wash Cars! I Wash Cars!
You've been a band four years but have not gotten far
Maybe I can help you sell records for a bit
You guys talk a lot of crap but you haven't done shit

CHORUS:

So you can talk all the shit you want but it's never gonna take away
How shitty of a band you are and your record label feels the same
You can tell everyone I'm bad and I won't try to explain
So all I know is that your band sucks cause you're a Digital Renegade
Re-Re-Renegade, you're a Digital Renegade
Re-Re-Renegade, you're a digital bunch of gays

[B. LAY]:

Ronnie has armed me, my army's behind me
And honestly, The Main Event, who's backing Sumerian
Who's acting a little black, saying "nig" a little bit
At the end of this little track, I'm a end it a little bad
You ignorant little man, I'm a savage in this rap
You're Italian? You Black? You wrestle!
The fact is, you lack the backbone to meet Radke in the back of his bus

[RONNIE RADKE]:
Now you trying to get buzz off the back of my luck

[B. LAY]:
Well I'm Black in the back of the bus
Waiting to smack a fake thug who's thinking he's tough
Cause his momma didn't give him enough love, or back rubs
I'll raise Hell above, I never gave a fuck

CHORUS

[RONNIE RADKE]:

And Lorenzo you're a bitch
You can suck my dick
Threaten me on YouTube?
Mr. Main Event

Hold up, hold up
[Mocking Lorenzo]:
"Bada-bing, bada-boom, I tell it like it is
I'm a scary mothafucka!
I go on YouTube and threaten people
I'm so hopped up on these steroids
My I See Stars shirt don't fit!
I love penis!"

How about you show your face like you said you did?
I put you on my guest list haven't heard from you since
You're a punk ass meathead with weak bread
Pissed off and regret cause the steroids shrunk your fucking penis
And Ash shovin' coke up Mr. Worsnop's nose
And everybody wonders why he spends his money on blow
Oh no
And when I see ya I'mma box ya', drop it like it's hot
Lockin' down your whole block, locksmith
Like the apocalypse when I'm dropping fists
Like a Southpaw, shock ya', dodgin' obstacles
Knocking fools out in the metropolis
A busted lip and bloody nostrils, sock your opticals
That is what you get for talking shit
Better come equipped the next time that you spit something sick
I'm fucking Swift like Taylor get it in son of a bitch
Ironic, isn't it?

CHORUS

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're not cool, and fuck you
Sumerian Records you're a bunch of punk pussies
So is Lorenzo. You fucking buff piece of shit. Fuck you
Bada-bing, bada-boom my fucking ass, motherfucker
You were never at my show
You never came down cause you're a bitchmade motherfucker
And you won't do shit. Fuck you and all your friends

Sumerian Records. Ash. 'Sumerian Records,' really?
You have a sphinx as a logo. A sphinx. An Egyptian logo
Right? That is a totally different race from an actual Sumerian
Those are two different races!
That's like me naming my record label 'Christianity Records'
And having a Buddha as our mascot, you fucking idiot. Fuck you

Fuck I See Stars, you fucking punk pussies. Every single one of you
You know exactly why you were on the fucking tour
Trying to make up some shit so you can get your band to sell a couple more records
Come at me when you can at least sellout a fucking venue you fucking bitch
Fuck all of you. Fuck everyone. Fuck all the fans that agree with I See Stars, too. Fuck you

I don't give a fuck about any of you motherfuckers
Oh yeah, hey Lorenzo: I've got this video that someone took of you
When you didn't know about it. And uh... Well, you be the judge
I'm gonna play the audio right here. Does this sound familiar?[Intro]
This is dedicated to all those critics
All you social sites
All you WiFi gangsters
Talk shit about this!
Fucking Bitch

[Verse 1]
I took a turn for the worse again, for stickin' my neck out for another friend
And this is what I get for being too nice, people wonder why I'm a fucking dick
What you would do if you had the world
Watching every move that you make up for
And everywhere that you ain't, you got a bitch tryna get you to admit it's stitching for attention, damn
That's the price of fame
I sold my soul into a ball of flame
That ball of flame is what keeps me lit,spill my heart in every bar and every line I spit
When that camera clicks and they're snapping pics, this is everything that I'm mentioning
This is the moment, I'll never let go of it, ready or not I'm about to take over it
Paparazzi, snappin' shots
Kamikaze, droppin' bombs
Family first, millionaire, debt reverse, heir to the chair
I reign supreme in every genre, stackin' that cheese, no lasagna
King of the jungle, Mufasa Mufasa
No worries for me, Hakuna-Matata!
Droppin' on the beat without a doubt or referee so need a piece up on a piece up on the mother fuckin' brink
You better think before ya blink cause I'm about to fuckin' swing hittin' everything I see in front of me, don't fuck with me
I'm killing every verse from the first word to the last verb, I'ma pass church like a bastard pastor
Last chapter, Mr. Mathers, wordest rapper, for the sake of crackers to get the last word

[Hook]
Never gonna be the same again
(Never gonna be the same)
(Never gonna be the same)
All I do is win, all I do is win
This is it, this is everything to me
Never gonna be the same again
(Never gonna be the same)
(Never gonna be the same)
All I do is win, all I do is win
This is it, this is everything to me

[Verse 2]
I'm chillin' on that sofa, hot like Arizona
The scene up in that coma, I'm a wake 'em up just like I'm folgers!
I'm a fucking soldier, never got my diploma
I'm up in them Cadillac's my teacher drive Toyota! HA
I don't give a fuck bro (I don't give a fuck bro)
And I don't call it luck though
I'm a fucking cut-throat
Bitch I got that recipe, mix it into a masterpiece
I'm rappin' in a rap-less scene
I stand on top of that balcony, and all I see surrounding me
Is tragedy, I spread my wings and vow to be the man to be
My chemistry, insymmetry, is made of gold like alchemy
I found things, so proud to be, is anyone gonna say they doubted me?!
Burn motherfucka burn
Watch how fast I can take this turn
In a car I never thought I'd have, man I can honestly say I've earned
And I've learned from the best, cursed to bless, stressin' less, most-certain yes
I'm better than I've ever been, no doubt about a champion, it's happenin' I'm stacking in and I'll never go back to that life

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rock and roll, solid gold
Rocket shows, heart on froze
Colder than 50 below, freezing the road, like Eskimo homes when I flow
Exposition, exposé
Consecutive hits, but my name ain't José
Conseco motherfucking leggo my ego, and motherfucking bitches good at the deep throat
Bitch! Suck a dick
Lickety split
Fucking stick shift I'm a stick with
Bitch! Switchin' lanes, checkin' my engine
Liftin' rims off while I'm thriftin'
Suck on a dip-stick, been in a ditch, damn
It's just like a trailer and I'll never get hitched in
Spittin' like a drain up on the dip in the kitchen
Pussies won't shove from the friction I'm gettin'
Gimme a break, gimme a break, gimme a break of that kitty cat click clack plow
Fuckin hard, knowin' them I'll keep on raisin the bar, stuck in a park, peelin' herb from the dark, livin' in a sequel like return of Jaffar Killing competition like a Honda Accord
With the brakes cut goin' about 104, foot to the floor, strap to the door
Crash, glass, snatch-n-grab, your motherfuckin' ass shoulda grabbed the gat
Ambulance, clear the ditch, had to come and pull your ass up out of the dash
That's what you get for fucking with me
I told you motherfuckers I'll be running these streets
Do not confuse who I have to be, compared to everything that I've done and seen!

[Hook][Hook: Deuce]
Nobody likes me, no one likes me
But I don't like them
Uh huh, I don't, nu uh
Nobody likes me, no one likes me
Why? Cause I don't like them
Uh huh, I don't, nu uh

[Verse 1: Deuce]
All this hate you gave me, it turned me deranged
Now I'm burning in the flames
All the things you said, they've been stuck in my head
And now I'm at it again, an addict
Welcome to hell bitch, you can't do nothing about it
Out of my way faggot, you heard what I said damnit
I am an automatic ready to fire back at all the fuckers laughing
Not gonna lie, I've had it, I'm gonna wreck havoc
Everyone's dying, don't matter

[Pre-Hook]
This is my chance, maybe my last
And if I leave there's no way back
This is your fate when worlds collapse
I took my pain now give it back

[Truth]
I give it back, give it back
Only one of us will laugh last
(Now give it back...)
I give it back, give it back
Break this whole fucking world in half

[Hook]

[Bridge: Deuce & Ronnie Radke]
I used to have so many friends
I thought I could trust
But when it came to saving me
You let me self-destruct

[Verse 2: Ronnie Radke]
Well I'm back now, I'm seeking out this vengeance
Not to mention that this black cloud, it sticks around
And visits my intuition, won't let me back down
And I swear to God, my heart is like a piston
Pumping rage into this engine, turn the keys to my ignition
Listen, nobody likes me
It's enlightening, it excites me
And I talk this shit with the lyrics I spit
And still nobody will fight me
Try walking a mile in my shoes and get beat with your own Nikes
I'm a grimey motherfucker with a mic, so call me Mickey
I got no patience lately for these fucking faggots faking
Making lies up, wise up
And if you really think you can take me
Wake me up from this lazy battle
Rattle you with my crazy battle
Pay my dues back on the saddle
The lonely road that I slowly travel

[Pre-Hook]
[Deuce]
This is my chance
Maybe my last
And if I leave
There's no way back
This is your fate
When worlds collapse
I took my pain
Now give it back

[Truth]
I give it back, give it back
Only one of us will laugh last
(Now give it back...)
I give it back, give it back
Break this whole fucking world in half
(Break this world in half!)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You thought you figured it out
You thought you figured it out
Uh huh, you thought you figured it out
You thought you... figured me out!
You'll never figure me out!
You can't figure me out!
Shut the fuck up!
I'll burn you fuckers down!
I know you're proud
I held my ground
Time's running out
You hear the crowd
They know you're down
Time's running out

[Hook]

[2x]
Now it's much too late
To say you're sorry
Don't care what you think
Uh huh, I don't, nu uh[Verse 1]
R. R. versus the whole damn state
No girls on the jury I done lost my case
My attorney’s nevous what the judge will say
About that fresh tattoo up on the side of my face
I got your bitch sending flicks to me naked
I be rocking stages while you’re minimum wagin’
Ha, no guns in my waist man
But I know a few dudes that are down to catch a case man
And ill welt you up and I’m down to scrap
As a matter a fact you better get back
Motherfuck clit clat attack
Everybody with a Mac sitting in the back of class fucking strapped
Amanda Bynes (Columbine)
Maybe I’m crazy, amazing in the cranium, praying for haters to actually face me

[Hook]
I’m just a stupid boy and I know why
Spendin’ all my time on the wifi
And I wonder why (Why)
I do not have a life
All I wanted is a bitch to fuck me (Fuck me)
But all these stupid bitches want to love me (You’re cute)
But inside I am ugly
U-u-u-u-u-u-u-ugly

[Verse 2]
Made about a mill this year
Made a big impression
Bitch, I am here
I fucked the game up
You can call it sodomy
My record label’s acting like they just won the lottery
Ha, my girl’s a temptress
Man I got a girl, baby mama, and mistress
“What? You got a mistress?”
“No, no, no, it’s not what it looks like, it’s just rap.”
“What?!”
“I’m just kidding. No calm down, it’s just…”
“OH MY FUCKING GOD”
HAHA I am not kidding
So much pussy I am tripling digits
Yahh
While I’m still standing
While out on your bitch like my name is Nick Canon (Canon)
Who wants to start shit?
I’m the darkest, sharpest blade but I sharpen
Rawest fuckin’ beef in the market
You’re harmless
Grab a carpet
Wrap your carcus in it
I’m far from finished
Bury you in the back of my garden wit it!
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, it’s the first of the month)
When I open my eyes ‘till the time that I close ‘em, I’m a soldier, supernova, broseph
(Get up, get up, get up, ‘cause you gotta get up)
Gotta get dat money, never gonna fold up, I’m tired of sleeping on the sofa
Is this what I’m supposed to be?
A motherfuckin’ cracker, it’s in my genes
I rap better and faster than anybody in the rap scene, I’m already rocking
Get it? Rock king, as in the crowns on me
And I’m rocking the boat on my time
And so please
Don’t quote me and I won’t squeeze
This motherfuckin’ pen, bitch
It’s like a gun
It’s fun when I pull the trigger
On the paper
Confrontin’ every motherfuckin’ hater I’m huntin’
(I’m beginning to feel like a rock god, rock god)
Word to Em and Dr. Dre ‘cause they’re the reason I rock this way DOG

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
R. R. versus the whole damn earth (earth)
I’ve been this way since my fuckin’ birth
I told you foreign fucks I ain’t a Ukrainian
But I’m Russian
Get it? At your cranium (ha ha)
Ooooh, he is so witty (thanks)
Ooooh, he is so pretty
Now kids, (yeah)
Don’t do drugs (Okay)
I’m kidding, get it?
They’re so much fun
Rap and rocked, rolled into one
Lock and loaded with ammo
Stocked and stowed away with guns
Unless you rock and rollers decide to talk and bolster
Who’s got the biggest Glock and holster
I suggest you do not open your mouth and run
Get back
Better watch out here I come DOG
Get sacked
Ready to attack anybody let’s play ball
It’s fourth and inches
Gotta swarm defences
Gotta get that goal
Gotta score the winnin’ touchdown with my nuts out
I’m a Viking bitch
And I punish towns
Fuck you bitches
Politican, I"m defined misogynistic
My hatred for women growin’ bigger with each day that I’m livin’
Some masochism lovin’ the crap that I’m spittin’
After the fact I wrap it in bow
And givin’ it to hoes in your home on Christmas
Happy Hanukkah
Feliz Navidad
Happy New Year
Now take off your bras
I told you broad that your pussy is bomb
And I’ll fuck you whore like you never been fucked before
Ah, ah, ah

[Hook][Hook: Deuce]
Who can stop us now?
While the whole world bows
Watch us share this crown
Every time you step in, we push you out
Who can stop us now?
While the whole world bows
Try and bring us down
Every time we step in, we push you out

[Verse 1: Ronnie Radke]
I rock hard, (no sleep)
Marriage, (not me)
My shoe game is so cold, see
Two reasons I got cold feet
And friendship is important
My gear is all imported
Deuce is on my chorus
Me and B.Lay gonna get that Forbes List
And I'm gonna straight roll to each state though
Gonna make a fuckin' killing on a bank roll
And can't ya see that I will compete
With any other rapper in the game, bro?
And I got this, cause I'm a locksmith
Got the game on lock
In a hot minute, and I'mma lose my cool
When I step up in the booth
'Bout to lose a tooth, cause I'm flossing
No oxygen bitch, I'm a glitch away
When I flip this motherfucker I got shit to say
Be cautious bitch I'm a twitch away
From snappin' on another fuckin' bitch today
Cause I'mma bench the weight
And I'mma get the cake
If anybody got a problem, I could demonstrate
To definition of a sauna, hotter than the summer
Park it undercover
I'ma beat the case of record
Trailer gonna, gonna, gun it like a gunner, put my foot up on the pedal to the metal, motherfucker
I'm a runner, and you wonder how I came up from the gutter
With a scalpel and a son of fuck
I swear I'm a part of ya'll on another level
I got turn up, gonna kill 'em with the thunder, motherfuckers gettin' dumber
Fuck you plumbers, suckin' shit up like a plunger
Everybody's got a problem, check it bubber
Anybody wanna solve it?
Get my number, fuck you harder
I'ma gut you like a motherfuckin' Glock

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.Lay]
Born to win, most my niggas were born to sin, I'm born again
Rock with the pistol, all christian
I'll cross you out for steppin' in, with my crew
What it do?
Sup, dude?
Wit crew eyes
And new 2 Pac in the boondocks
I'm never givin' in to your rude thoughts
And I'm bangin' like a motherfuckin' boombox
Since age of two
Lookin' outside, seein' red and blue
With a sue, woo-hoo
And a goo-goo twos
And my coo-coo moon, so who are you to question?
Never hung 'round niggas that gang bang
Let their pants hang, do their damn thang
Let the pistol bang, and the booty sang
Gets past the jail with the booty train
So who's gonna stop me now?
Huh?
I rose from the ghetto to a different level
The motherfuckin' Devil won a hell of a hell hold
If Hell froze, (Hell nah)
Come walk in my shoes, see a different view
Want with your shoes
To be another motherfuckin' stat in the news
I planned it, boo
And you wonder why all my niggas like fancy jewels, baggy pants, and flashy shoes?
Been bobbin' the source and passin' dudes
I'm a fashion dude
I'm dat nigga doe
And my new back, and my new swag
And my new snap in that game
Yeah, I'm dat new, nigga' dat rain

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ronnie Radke]
Who's gonna stop us now?
Who's gonna stop us now?
(Nobody, nobody)
Who's gonna stop us now?
(Who can stop us now?)
(Nobody, nobody)
Who's gonna stop us now?
(Who can stop us now?)
(Nobody, nobody)
(Who can stop us now?)
Who's gonna stop us now?
(Who can stop us now?)
(Nobody, nobody)
Who's gonna stop us now?
(Who can stop us now?)
(Nobody...)If I was granted one wish it would be for you to see me
For who I really am because these looks can be deceiving
And, I swear to God, if you listen closely
By the time this song is over you will truly know me
Because I am not a monster, I am just a man
And im getting sick and fucking tired of these fans
They expect me to be a perfect version of a fucking person
And its hurtful, I feel worthless I just wanna feel im worth it
And its hard but I am learning to be honest
And discerning and i am gaining all my courage to be better
I am searching (Damn) but its so damn hard to keep calm
When everything I know is broken and scarred!
Im not trying to complain about my problems at all
Because my problems are the reason i have gotten this far
So I am thankful for adversity for making me strong
Im just trying to explain how I feel in a song
It goes...

Oh!
I really can't believe im here right now
Im hanging on an airplane
Falling through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh!
I never ever want to touch the ground
Im walking on a tightrope
Searching for the right note
To play that sound

Lets take it back to'92 when I was 8
My brother gave me a tape by mistake: Dr. Dre
It was December 15th to the date (Lemme ride)
The Chronic on my birthday must have been fate!
Now lets flash forward to the first time in'99
When i heard Shady on the radio and, to my surprise
That this is really happening a white boy is rapping
From the bottom to the top that motherfucker made it happen
So i grab my pen and pad and start writing down the madness
Later joined a band and wrote my songs around my sadness
Formulated all my Tragic moments into Magic
Now im selling tickets to my show and have them packed in
You best believe it because im telling the truth
I bought a motherfucking Caddy and a house with a view
Dont need to prove im amazing and im keeping it true
So before you try to hate me take a walk in my shoes
It goes...

Oh!
I really can't believe im here right now
Im hanging on an airplane
Falling through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh!
I never ever want to touch the ground
Im walking on a tightrope
Searching for the right note
To play that sound

And after all iv'e been through I can say i made it
Through the fucking bullshit to the other side safely
I can truly say i can feel myself changing into a better person
Dont give a fuck if you can hate me
Never gonna let you fucking take me down
The path im used to taking
And i know in my heart of hearts the problems that im facing
Is in half the battle im fighting, energy i am wasting
Im so sick of these fucking bitches changing what im saying
Into something that its not, man this shit has to stop
Shit, ill wear the clothes I want and cut my hair all off
And ill do it just to prove that im a motherfucking boss
And my music keeps me moving, I will not slow or pause
Id like to think that im A-Okay
And my worries are all foolish and will fade away
One day id like to think i faced my fate
And my legacy lives on you'll remember my name
It goes...

Oh!
I really can't believe im here right now
Im hanging on an airplane
Falling through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh!
I never ever want to touch the ground
Im walking on a tightrope
Searching for the right note
To play that sound

Oh!
I really can't believe im here right now
Im hanging on an airplane
Falling through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh!
I never ever want to touch the ground
Im walking on a tightrope
Searching for the right note
To play that sound
