Step in the building, bitches get excited, have you ever seen a female riot?
Oh, gettin' too close then somebody might shoot you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's big pimping over here... Church

Kush in my lungs, I smoke when I want, they want me for Christmas
Rolling my weed, she cook and she clean, she doing my dishes
Came over, she pulled my dick out, then she started blowing it kisses
Sprayed it all over her face, now the bitch watching my children
Probably be in outer space, standing on all of these millions
Let’s get it niggas

You know what I'm sippin', you know what I'm grippin' (you know what's on call)
I'm all on that, boss niggas got passes I know that they crippin' (you know what I'm crippin')
Give 'em the fork and give 'em the bowl, I know they ain't whippin' (I know they ain't in the pot)

Your shooters, they bluffin'

Migos, Lil Durk, Cash Out on the curb
Skippa Da Flippa itching for body, give him the word
Bet you won't bust a move
All my niggas got choppers, they'll damage you

Have a nigga floatin' in the Chattahoochee river, fool

I'm cooking a brick and they call me McLuvin'
Trap or die nigga, no Jeezy, corporate thuggin'

But she twerkin’ (8x)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Shawty gon’ toss that pussy at me like an alley-oop
There’s some bitches in this club, but ain’t none as bad as you
With an ass as fat as yours, watch me make it thunder storm
Flyer than a G-6, come on shawty come aboard
You deserve an award or a trophy, I ain’t jokin’
Looking at it from the front and I can see that ass pokin’
Out your dress, thirty minutes have you coming out your dress
Spend a one night stand with me, make you change your address
Get it on the first night, baby, I ain’t here to judge
Say you want that dope dick, I can be your plug
We can get it in this club, we can get it in the whip
First you gotta show them lips if you tryna get a tip

[Verse 2: Cash Out]
It’s some big booty bitches in the building, ooh-wee
The way she clap her hands, the way she clap her booty
And I’m like “oh my God Becky, look at her butt”
Got called the trashman ‘cause she got some junk in her trunk
She put that arch in her back, she started throwing it back
You know I’m watching it wiggle, I let her grab on my missile
She say I’m fucking tonight, she let me know it’s official
The way she sluprin’ and twerkin’ she might just get her a Birkins

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
Grabbing on that tooly, smackin’ on that booty
I told her “twerk” she say “why” I say “why? because I’m Boosie”
I walked off in that club, walked up and I approached her
First she say I was a dog, now she twerkin’ up in my Rover
Surfing up in my Rover, showing off like she supposed to
She ain’t have to tell me smack her ass, I smacked it ‘fore she told me
Got too many hoes, I’m loaded, she twerk on the pole so perfect
Sassy mouth every time she talk, but she show me that she worth it
Twerk

[Verse 4: Ty Dolla $ign]
She twerk it, she twerk, dropping that ass all the way to the dirt
You know she bad twerkin’ it all in my pants, twerkin’ it all in my shirt
Aww fuck, say she got a man, I’m like “so what?”
Toot it up for a real one with a million, oh yeah (okay)
I got her on that D’Usse
Told her pop that oochie coochie, smack her on the booty
Do it for the Vine, do it for the dollar sign
Pull them panties to the side, girl don’t sigh

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Kid Ink]
She twerkin’, go ‘head, don’t be nervous
Club hot, it’s the furnace, I know your feet hurtin’
In them heels, so high, no lie for certain
Get away from them squares and throw that in a circle
See me grabbing on the booty, my goonies got the tooly
Said it’s Kid Ink, baby, who the fuck is you confusing?
Bust it, bust it, bust it down bust it bus side of the Bendo
Used to be my old ho, now she acting brand new
Shawty from the hood, tell from her tattoo
Both sides go up, I just call her Lambo
Left, right, l-left, right I hit that Tina Ike
She drop down and twerk it and now I see the light

Talkin' bout feelings, Rich Homie don't give a fuck
Walk around, pants saggin' with that pistol tucked
That's your girl? Come and get her 'fore I woof woof, Mystikal
Diamonds, they crystal clear, ridin' in these brand new cars

17, I don't need no mother
I got pain, I killed the pen and I killed the paint job
Rocket launcher, crazy gun like in Super Contra
Kangaroo pouch with the strap, it's down under
Satellite dish, turtle top dunk, cowabunga
Got them black shades, can't see shit, Stevie Wonder
And I'll shoot a nigga in his shit, you better run, bruh
"Gucci got a gun, he 'bout to click, better run swift"
I just wanna shoot, don't wanna hit, got a four fifth

MAC-11, don't keep it at home, got it right here

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Bag full of guns, let me pick out one
Whomever wanna test, let that bad man come

Gucci got a gun, please put down the gun
Flocka got a gun, please put down the gun

Silencers on the chopsticks, Avon - I got a lot of guns
Big guns like Contra that'll shell shock you like Blanka
Shooter save a shooter, I'm a top shotter
Waka Flocka Flame, I got the juice, partner
Low jolt the gun, that's the anaconda
Fuck the law until they free my partner
Chopper kick like Liu Kang, free Poo Tang, who-who bang?
You real then I'm recruitin', you a dead man wit' that FN in my hand
Don't fuck wit' niggas, Ku Klux Klan, get love all in the Motherland
Make ya best friend kill you for the bands, get love all in Rosecrans
Got a Mack 10, AK, SK, .223, 3 throwaways, that's a 40, real P-Funk

Hoes wanna come see ya boy now cause hoes wanna fuck with me
Subsidized housing is a project
Poppa never taught me how to cock it
Poppa just taught me how to respect it
Sauga City taught me how to pop it
Bullets don't come with a nina
Gun's don't with a killer, Gun's don't come for vanilla
