[Killa Tay]
Uh huh, Yeah
We gone call this one big scrilla
For all my niggas out there thug pimpin
D-1A up in this muthafucka, ya' know
For yall sucka ass niggas, uh

Hollerin all the cheap shit, but you ain't rappin right nigga
Gimmie the mic, feel me like you appetite nigga
Supposed to be hard, but y'all ain't actin like niggas
Probably go both ways like a hermaphrodite nigga
Bitch mades can't get no love
I hit the highway like O.J, with blood on my gloves
I roll like young buck, homies wanna hang with me
But I'm a killa on the grind livin dangerously
I'm thug pimpin, from Visalia to Australia
Never been a failure better believe it when I tell ya
Sell you nothin but the A-1 yeh
The innovator, pistol players mandatory one shot
To end the story the glory days is over
If you dont work, you dont eat
All that talkin is cheap mayne, this hustle game is deep
Packin pistolas, west cola till they burry me
With a bullet in my casket
To lift my soul and keep them scared of me
Work, like chemotherapy, when i let loose with the ??
So relentless, we sneakin, and creepin and keepin it off the hinges
Bullys wit Fullys pullin strings like Jimi Hendrix
Fuck a trick biotchh, when it comes to my click, my love is endless, IIIII -stick em like syringes, hard, heavy and deadly
I do whatever it take in life to make continous fetti
Ready and willing killin them all off like nazi's
No time for the he say she say we stay sloppy of that broccolli
We mob deep

[Chorus]
Ride for my niggas
Stay on the grind down to die for my niggas
We real killas, big scrilla
Blazin up doja zips
Nigga, one false move and its over with, we blast
And mash hard, livin large like a rock star lookin out for cop cars
Mob life is, money over bitch, fuck a snitch, we the niggas hittin licks
Flippin bricks gettin rich off tricks

[Killa Tay]
I put it down for my homies, Fresno to Toronto
Imagine if im livin in dead, head hauncho
All up on your shit, westside represent
Money and dope fuck a bitch, im a balla and a pimp
Nigga we real ridas, ain't no studio killas
Leavin them hurt, doin the dirt, puttin in work for the scrilla
We mofioso, fuck the po-po, federali's and task
Got a fifty cal, when i ride around and the funk down we blast
Skid off in they ass like gas, and get my strike on
Hit the back route to my batch house cause im sleepin with my nikes on
I'm seein facin hearin voices at my window
Maybe these niggas is comin for me or maybe its the indo
Sometimes I feel like I'm the that's doin ??
Cause I'm shady to my own lady, smokin up all my dank
Down to blow, been funkin wrong lately
I'm under pressure, with a tazer under my pillow
And a Glock on top of my dresser
My bitch say I'm paranoid, and my momma think I'm special
But fuck them, I can't trust nobody but Dan Wessern
Its a, cold game, they only know me by my code name
Agent 187, smobbin ?? sprayin cocaine

[Chorus]

[Killa Tay]
Damging bodies is a hobby they try to stop me but i mash hard
Livin on the run like a track star so why act hard
You know we packin when its time for some action
These niggas never see me like revy jackson
We be taxin they ass like IRS, I bring death
They call me the grim reaper, creepin and sneakin em with the left
Till they tone death my tank on F, I smash out
I ain't no punk smokin dope blunts till I pass out
I'm a rida, I love my momma mayne I'm puttin in work
And doin dirt, skeet skirt, off the block, fuck the cops
I'm the bully on the block, with fully on the spot
When you see us ain't no love, we some thugs on the block
Watch, these papers gone turn
Before the burn my im connected like a crooked attorney
My money dirty like a football jersey at halftime
Cause a nigga on a savage ass rhyme poppin my 9 for my past time
But now I make mine the honest way
Can't let em fuck me like they did my folks Anerae
My momma say im in too deep, but i can't change
And it seem like my baby boy gone grow up doin the same thang
Gotta gang bang, gotta maintain
Caught up in this thug shit, busta catch a slug quick
It ain't no love trick
I got hoes, from the crest side to the east side O'
We get a sack and hit the track and ride slow thug livin nigga

[Chorus till end]
I ride for my niggasThis game
Is to be sold not told
Pay styles, pay pay styles
Pay styles, pay styles
Feds tappin in on shit
You know, playin hard ball

(Killa Tay)
I never liked to sign autographs, I mash for all the cash
My third eye shine like brass, my life flash
I blast, when I ride past, pervin and swervin
Off the cream soda and bourban, puttin in work like service
It ain't no get back punk, my mini spit back chunks
Won't be caught up in no scandal, we gon' handle the funk
I'm representin for the Yay cause, ain't no love
For none of these pretty-boy ballers, they just some fake thugs, wit a Yay plug
We them niggas runnin up yo house regulatin
Do or die, down for the scrilla, we cheddar chasin
Momma gave birth to a killa, premeditatin
????, ready to resurrect my thug nation
Creepin while they sleepin like gorillas in the mist
In Y2K hits, my niggas spray shit
Every solution, it's revolution, so we all shootin
Fuck the system, I refuse to be the victim of an execution
It's ??? from prison, that I'm tryin to stay livin
And givin no gloved out, we thugged out
Until the death of me, I'm thinkin bout some treachery
On the click I get sick, like a nigga wit leprosy
When they step to me
It's smash murder

Hook (C-Bo)
It's Hard Ball, yard call, up against the wall
People my enemies envy me, write on the walls
Wit ya life in draws, blue bandanas and stand tall
When the dope pop unlock, it's war til we fall
(Repeat)

(Killa Tay)
Twistin tongues, get em sprung, like the crack rock
I gets love from the gardens to the Mac block
I ride hot wit my strap cocked, coast trippin
Started servin stones, now we rappin for chickens
Bloody victims, camouflaged in ditches
I'm ridin wit the little homie, dodgin you bitches
Mobbin these switches, bouncin through the light in the rain
My niggas mafia connected, spendin life in the game
No turnin back, we burnin sacks, to try to deal wit the pain
Before the feds shoot me dead, I put the steel in my brain
I bet they bury me a down ass G, so until I see
Prison or hell, I'm thug livin for mail
Wit clientele from the ATL back to the Bay
I bubble up, to servin double ups, back in the day
Mr. Packin still got the spot, crackin today
Unpluggin niggas, mean muggin niggas, passin the J
My block, I keep my squad tight, we make them nights
Ridin dirty through the MIA, shakin vice
Murder all hoes that go in my way, protect my life
Wit these warfare machinery, high blowin greenery
Touch em like a comedy
Tickle the spine, twist they mind like Geometry
On my momma I'm a G
Any shit that benefit, I represent
Like a Nazi, til somebody pop me
Throw up the dub

Hook 2x

(Killa Tay)
It's been a long time, the West Coast got it crackin now
I'm smokin MC's like Black & Mild
Tryin to copycat my rappin style
Bomb status, savage tactics, gettin my money stacked in piles
I flow like the Nile River, living sermon like a preacher
In the pull pit, still pack a full clip
Told you I'm a fool bitch, I stay high
Killa T-A-Y, and hear the pound down for the drive-by
These G's ride, and it ain't no fear in my heart
You talkin loud, wolfin threats, but I know you a mark
Playa hatin so I'm waitin, for the ride to start
I come creepin like a ninja when it's quiet and dark
We playin hard ball, so if you soft step off
Cause ain't no hoppin up outta this game, once these shots let off
We rippin they heads off for tryin to cross
Attackin like a wolfpack, I push back brains, you know my name
It's the K-I-double L-A-T-A-Y, call me the Locsta
Can't be runnin up in these stank routes, and my bank fat like Oprah
Gank sacks to smoke off, we all high
If the funk jump, we Loc up cause, we all ride
You know my niggas down for the homicides and rapes
Po-po catch me bailin, while I'm sellin these tapes
I make my money legit.......Sike!
I'm makin G's pushin ki's, and bustin raps on the mike
We chippin weed at the studio, what's crackin tonight
I hear the Lord callin my name, tryin to get back in my life
I see the devil's face deep in my dreams, lookin friendly
But I recognize the public as my enemy
Cause I'm coast trippin

Hook 2x

Yeah, West Coast Mafia
For my real folks
Everybody else suck a dick
Nigga this Fresno
Penzoni for life nigga
All the rest is phonies
Big ballin respect that[Chorus by 151]
Westcoast trippin - trippin

[Pizzo]
If you want some get some

We be strapped down like the old west
Crawl slow meet your fate
Fuck you and me and the .9 milli sick S

All snitches put to rest
No problems to bring death
On any that try to test
So come get some

[Laroo]
?? from my angle
None of that playin that shit that you been hearin
We're gettin our papparaz on
Robbin 'em with the scarfs on
For the paper stand and stiff
They 'bout to the gift
Patna rappin to the clips
Gold knuckles to the dips
They're not fadin a operation
They already havin seal
Niggas try get deny
Later down no lyin kill
What you fear you can test
Recognize we're from the west
Bringin non-stop pain to your chest nigga

[Marvaless]
Gaffle your thoughts ? plots
Get you caught up with shots
It's all about whose trigger is bigger
Who's strapped and who's not
So if you want come , come get some
Bring the static we add it
Nowhere you can manage the damage I deliver
I figure that if you got enough heart
To bring the funk let it start
The boss bitch up in this rap shit
From day one you was done
Nigga it be me
They don't call me Marvaless for nothing
Westcoast representin
Disrespect we club the dub(W) in

[Chorus by 151]

[Pizzo]
Damn
Fairly even hit ya and we split ya
Did you even see it comin
Before you started runnin
Stunnin , amazin
When the guns blazin
Enemies start raisin off the turf
Cause we're known to bomb first
Layin in burst wet your T-shirt and get scurbed
That's how us niggas put in work
So if you want some get some
If not light and hit one
Heavy like 10 tons
Crazy on the gas when we've beamed one

[Lunasicc]
Want some get some
Better not take some
I doubt you lived that long
My niggas pack chrome tech .9's
Bustin while cuzzin lettin out frustration
Lookin for drive-byes rollin in a '65
Perry Mason dressed in all black
Ski masks down fuck probation
You disrespected
So I gives a damn about catchin cases
Rapin' niggas like bitches
Got 'em comin out clothes like ho's
Break up the chopper then popp him
Melt 'em down like gum

[Killa Tay]
Want some get some
Better not take some
Breaks 'em off properly
Feds still watchin me
Bitches still jockin me
Sceemin on my property
Like monopoly
Cause we're clockin Geez
Like a teller at the bank
Sprayin on the Tommy
Cause I'm smellin like the dank
Ho's tryin to talk bad
But I never sweat it
So shut your fuckin mouth and
Lets your name ??
Hard headed young bucks
Showin off they heat
But I got mine too
Always on the creep
AWOL'in for life
Callin shots in every hood
Got the white man hatin
Like my name was Tiger Woods
But it's all good

[Chorus][Killa Tay]
I got hustle in my heart, hustle in my vain
I hustle wit my click and gotta hustle in the game
West Coast Mafia, we keepin it crackin
Deep as the Jacksons, my click stay in the midst of the action
Packin all the shows, mackin all the hoes
Stackin all the dough, make 'em wanna call the po
Real G's wit the tightest flows runnin the streets
Comin wit heat, no retreat, this game get deep
We speak in codes and ball like Jalen Rose til the end of time
We live this grind like an esse with money on my mind
24/7 Cali legend, makin paper wit Bo
My Snake Eyes glow, and I'm still puttin it down for the 'No
And K.O. so lay low, or get your chin checked like a boxer
We break 'em off proper, spray like Binaca
I still watch the time fly by on the clock
My verbal venom get up in 'em and they die on the spot

[Hook 2X: Tiffany Wilson]
It's about money, bet you I'm gon get it
Power, ain't nobody trippin
Respect, respect, respect my gangsta
My gangsta

[Spice 1]
Motherfucker I'm a villain, and nigga you's a hostage
So whenever I'm steppin, cover yo dome like an ostrich
Suckers is bleedin off this, niggas is leakin off this
You know why?  Cuz I'm a thug nigga eatin off this
Jealous, that's how they feelin eventually
That's why I pull out my pistol and bust it intentionally
Smash, that's what we do when we ride
Keep my bitches on point, and keep all my enemies hidin
It's the motherfuckin real ones, ridin for mother millions
Worldwide bosses makin decisions with precision
Thug livin on a mission, gotta stay outta prison
Hope my thug angel sittin on the star that I'm wishin

[Hook]

[Yukmouth]
Jea, jea...
I'm swingin everything from bats to gats
On the ave, I'm slangin everything from crack to wax
Tylenol, gotta grind and ball, stack my scratch
No time to stall, flip the 'Lac wit the stash wit a Mack
It's like that, outta town I got them pies and I fly back
I'm right back wit that dope wrist like an ice pack
You can't stop me, I'm too cocky
I puff broccoli in Medina Ferrari's, I'm Yuk DiBiase
On point, never see me sloppy
I'll catch a body before I let a nigga rob me at the after party
Thug Lord so I run mobs, gun high
Fill a square body up wit holes like he's Spongebob
East Oakland, Fresno to Modesto
On the block they call me Kid Rock, play wit heavy metal
And got my workers on the block slangin every pebble
Cause it's a Regime Mob nigga in every ghetto

[Hook] - 2X* Thug Thisle version has a re-mastered beat and shorter ending

[Killa Tay]
I'm mastermindin the plot, you ???? the spot
Wicked intentions, sensin friction, when the funk gon' pop
I tote my heat, and hold my ground
They know I clown
Pistol whippin and strippin em
Down to they riches, rapin they bitches
Nigga it's a, jack move, 187, count yo blessin
Hollow tips fire from all directions, leavin em wetted
Yo pieces deleted from existence, don't make no difference
I'm bangin like Metallica, serve any challenger
With a tre 8 caliber, fuckin em up like Algebra
From Cali to Florida, call the coroner
I'm missing in action, packin a full clip, for the bullshit
I told my nigga Lynch I got his back face
What's up now, ?????

[Brotha Lynch Hung]
Killa Tay, and I'm jackin the ditch
From the shit that get spit to take a lock on the dick
Like a red nosed pick nigga
I don't really give a shit about they life man
Off that night train
Cut they fuckin throat wit a knife man
And that's right man
Leave em layin in the cut
With they guts cut up what up
Put ya nuts up, on the shelf with no help
I'm so hell I'm so stealth, (I'm so, I'm so)
Nigga, Mr. know where to be contacted
Just bombsack it, tell my momma how I'm actin
When I'm packin I got my practice
In, I'm off that gin, losin wind(What you waitin for)
I'm waitin for the show to begin, half past ten thirty
Reverend like James, straight up strange
Shootin range, twenty four feet
Leave you off the earth with this heat
Leave you in the street, human meat
Believe me, I still be workin this like a thug(Like a thug)
Put you in the back of the Coupe DeVille
Take you to the alley, shoot to kill
Fuck that I gotta buck back(Nigga)
Fuck that(Nigga)
I ain't goin out like no zombie
Nigga smokin all that bomb weed
You possess and yes, I'm strapped like tombstone
Ready to pull out the Rafe, man, clackin wit Killa Tay
Lunasicc, Marvaless

[Chorus]
Like Jason, and CamCrystals with a pistol
Chainsaw and merchetti when the funk start, we ready
Like Jason and CamCrystals with a pistol
Chainsaw and merchetti, we serious about that fetti

[Marvaless]
Paper chase, but still credit to large accounts
Survive by the ounce all in the mix
Just as deep as it gets, ??? no counterfeits
Strictly bout my six, but don't ever doubt it
My niggas is bout it
For the love of the money and game
Shakin you niggas is funny
It's just somethin about, the way the game get spit
Cali niggas find a ??? in, for the scrilla strictly ballin
I figure a bitch nigga be the first to test
The first to get blessed
Not the one to stress I'm too complex
And my mind-state, no contest
Hot what I do so it takes a god to do what I must
Never had no trust
Cuz niggas will snitch
Go on some other shit real quick
Scholar, bout that dollar, make you holla, make you feel it
Drop wit Killa, we the realest
Cali niggas runnin the chain up

[Lunasicc]
Double C, the gangsta with the Glock in the cut
Identify the busta, aim first, then I bust
Creepin with the mask, blast on any nigga that move
Put my bitch in the back seat, cuz my AP need room
I got a real crew of niggas, ain't no punks in my squad
Bitch, to get away, drive, but don't leave till the bank get robbed
I wear Khaki Pants, Levi Jeans, and Hilfiger's
Puttin em on they back like they drunk off liquor
So throw them rags up
If niggas trippin, we catch em slippin, hold them 9's up
Blast on they ass, flash on they ass
Light my weed up, I like to get away high
On the cut postin like Pac
Niggas scream til I die, I'm no lie

[Chorus] - 2xVerse 1 (Killa Tay)
We pump slugs, and punk thugs for their drugs
When push come to shove ain't no motherfuckin love
Bow down, we just hit the town
But we brung shit like Hitler, bail em with a Sigma
Switch with the first shot, gotta check the spot
Burnin rubber out the parkin lot, pointin out the window
Stuck off indo, bumpin my nigga C-Bo
Bitches all in my business cos they think I move kilo's
I, call my people's on the mobile, gang global, nationwide distribution
Now I'm posted up in Houston
Texas, ridin a Lexus but it's supremo
Niggas set trippin, so a solo weapon is essential
Keep the pepper spray on my car keys, only fuck with hard Gz
Still get my ball on like Barkley
Nothin but the California hog in me
Touchin triggers, real niggas, straight doggin freaks

Chorus:

Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?

Verse 2 (JT the Bigga Figga)
We take the occupation when movin, my hustle never stop
Check what? Some babies camera's peep the blocks, stash the Glocks
Posi's squashed, ship ki's and here there's thousand dollar bidders
Rim hats with feathers, more money than Perry Ellis
Never known behind ???, talkin "let my nuts hang"
Trade ya the .4-5 and the Tek 9 for a drop Mustang
A long line of killers, drug dealers with stripes
Just schoolin, you're rollin pontentially, could take your advice

(C-Bo)
We count big face and straight laces by the hundreds
Ragtops and big blocks, gettin the money
Sippin X-O Hen, and I get it for the 1-10
In a convertible Benz, fearin hunted, on twins
They call me Bo-Loc, and fo' sho' I smoke the dodo
And flip the '97 Sport to shake the po-po
High rollers count, tall dollars will never fall
In this shit for the cash nigga, enter, forever ball

Chorus

Verse 3 (C-Bo)
We are surprised in this rap game
Straight gangsta shit makes the world go round, I'm nuttin nice
On a dice, bets are more wet and crush ice
X-O, stretch Rolls, Bza's and Lexo's
And fuck the best hoes, and never slippin like Magic Johnson
Keeps my top down, increase my hatto, from Sac to Compton
Rolex down, fools shot up, solid ice
The gin in the cask was still followed by the vice
In the S-Class, we does it on the gas
On my cell, Bo poppin my collar, all about my cash
How many diggers can you scat? Now picture that
Without the feds on your back, homey, and that's a fact
We attack with Mac 1-12's to protect my sack
I pick up my pack, tellin the order "handle that"
It ain't no room for you busters cos we knuckle ya downfall
Player haters, fuck y'all, let these ballers all ball

Chorus:

Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Tell me, can we ball?[Lunasicc]
Now who the fuck can hang with this westside crook?
Put niggas to sleep, swing with a left counter with a hook
Jook niggas like Barry, bodies bloody like Mary
Too scary to even look at when that ass gets buried
Gettin' carried away put to death by the vet
I'm a rider, Sac-town, Southside og timer
Gangsta for real, I peel hoes like peelin' oranges
A warning
Don't run up on these crazy Californians
I'm on ya, like leeches out the mud on yo ass
Pull out the strap, cock it back, unload on yo ass
Dodgin' the cops tryin' to get my props, pop 'em like a pimple
Like 3X Krazy, ain't it all so sick, ain't it all so simple
Pistola packin'
See some marks then I'm jackin'
Run up on him then I smack him
Put one in his New York jacket
Ridin' away peepin' the rear view
Lettin' you bleed in the middle of the street
Motherfucker we don't fear you

[Killa Tay]
Uhh
Nathan soft
I breaks 'em off
Like Bo and Lurch
If you scared to do some dirt, go to church
Fuckin' with these cap peelas
Niggas that stack scrilla
With the mack in the back of the van
For the man that run up on the Killa T-A-Y
Do or die
Twist Dosia to keep me high
Sleepy eyes
Creepin' up with no disguise
No surprise
When I draw down, instantly bustin', touchin' brains
This, ain't no fuckin game
Kill 'em up ain't nothin' changed
Murder one is my specialty
Death to niggas that step to me
I take it to the next degree
Take 'em sicker than leprosy
Inevitably, I'm steadily dodgin' task
Heavily pervin'', servin' corners when I'm mobbin' on the gas
Nigga I'm a cap peela
You fuckin' with a real nigga
Drug dealer with a nine milla puttin' jacks down for the scrilla
Fill a, nigga with lead
Leavin' him dead
So rest in peace
Light him up like a torch
From the South to the North from the West back to the East
We riders

Chorus: (all lines simultaneous) X2

[Mississippi] This is for you haters
[Luna]	Up jumps the boogie
We gonna ride tonight
	Straight gone off doobies

So quickly strictly business
	Gonna ride tonight

[Killa Tay]
I stay stuck like Chuck, choppin' it up on the homey's faulty
Flossy with the flava, major haters trying to solve me
Cross me
In the game you get your life took
We be hurtin'
Puttin' in work
Like a bg can't see me like a right hook
To the brain too much game for you to match about my scratch bitch
Nigga don't need no practice
Show me the loot and I'm at this
Gat up under the mattress
One up in the chamber
Real gang banger
Ain't no stranger to this danger
For dangler, fade ya like the major Cali chronic
Niggas that test the west gonna rest in peace and that's a promise
Got 'em hooked like phonics
Shakin' 'em up like I'm Mystic
Wicked when I'm with this stay in motion like a stick shift
I rip this
Burn 'em up like syphillis
Let 'em know I'm locced, leavin' 'em broke like it was Christmas
Stompin' in my steel toes, always down to bo-guard
We hoo-ride on tight tracks got sacks like a nose guard
That capital I-N-D-O got me faded, affiliated with ballers and thugs
Movin drugs to make a profit, pockets swollen
Rollin' blunts up fatter than your dick
Sick approach, puttin' in work with my folks Lunasicc

[Lunasicc]
I got no time for you bustas I'm born and raised to be a hustla
We creep in the night puttin' it down on you suckas
Murder motherfuckers
And when I come I'm a dump
Jump out the back of the van
With the mack like man where the funk, punk?
I keeps it poppin
Non-stoppin droppin' shit like a seagull
Blastin', without no mask kill 'em up fast when I mash my Reagle
Flashin' quicker than faggots at a disco club
They bow down, when I come around cause I'm oh so tough
Shoelaces tied so ain't no reason for me to trip
When provoked I choke a bitch until she gimme that grip
Murder I wrote, like movies make the whole crowd scream
Runnin' through the back door bustin' like I'm jackin' for cream
Nigga duck down
I'm 'bout to pound like some cake
Psycho, schizo, to the nymphos can my nine get ate?
Nutty like the professor
Pullin' out weed like dressers
Make 'em all fall
When it call for laws I change like draws
Into a killa
Fuck the world I'm out to get my scrilla
Don't give a fuck about bitches, don't give a fuck about niggas
My trigga pulls like pimps, with they hoes on the strip
'Bout this money, ain't nothin' funny when I'm clockin' that grip
Bag 'em like they some groceries
You niggas don't know me
Tight like blue Nikes, I'm kickin' this funky shit like Shinobi
Might go do life for bustin' I'm bringin' ya death
Kill at will, bitch, with the steel until there ain't nothin' left
Psycho

[Chorus 2X][Killa Tay]
Uh huh, Yeah
We gone call this one big scrilla
For all my niggas out there thug pimpin
D-1A up in this muthafucka, ya' know
For yall sucka ass niggas, uh

Hollerin all the cheap shit, but you ain't rappin right nigga
Gimmie the mic, feel me like you appetite nigga
Supposed to be hard, but y'all ain't actin like niggas
Probably go both ways like a hermaphrodite nigga
Bitch mades can't get no love
I hit the highway like O.J, with blood on my gloves
I roll like young buck, homies wanna hang with me
But I'm a killa on the grind livin dangerously
I'm thug pimpin, from Visalia to Australia
Never been a failure better believe it when I tell ya
Sell you nothin but the A-1 yeh
The innovator, pistol players mandatory one shot
To end the story the glory days is over
If you dont work, you dont eat
All that talkin is cheap mayne, this hustle game is deep
Packin pistolas, west cola till they burry me
With a bullet in my casket
To lift my soul and keep them scared of me
Work, like chemotherapy, when i let loose with the ??
So relentless, we sneakin, and creepin and keepin it off the hinges
Bullys wit Fullys pullin strings like Jimi Hendrix
Fuck a trick biotchh, when it comes to my click, my love is endless, IIIII -stick em like syringes, hard, heavy and deadly
I do whatever it take in life to make continous fetti
Ready and willing killin them all off like nazi's
No time for the he say she say we stay sloppy of that broccolli
We mob deep

[Chorus]
Ride for my niggas
Stay on the grind down to die for my niggas
We real killas, big scrilla
Blazin up doja zips
Nigga, one false move and its over with, we blast
And mash hard, livin large like a rock star lookin out for cop cars
Mob life is, money over bitch, fuck a snitch, we the niggas hittin licks
Flippin bricks gettin rich off tricks

[Killa Tay]
I put it down for my homies, Fresno to Toronto
Imagine if im livin in dead, head hauncho
All up on your shit, westside represent
Money and dope fuck a bitch, im a balla and a pimp
Nigga we real ridas, ain't no studio killas
Leavin them hurt, doin the dirt, puttin in work for the scrilla
We mofioso, fuck the po-po, federali's and task
Got a fifty cal, when i ride around and the funk down we blast
Skid off in they ass like gas, and get my strike on
Hit the back route to my batch house cause im sleepin with my nikes on
I'm seein facin hearin voices at my window
Maybe these niggas is comin for me or maybe its the indo
Sometimes I feel like I'm the that's doin ??
Cause I'm shady to my own lady, smokin up all my dank
Down to blow, been funkin wrong lately
I'm under pressure, with a tazer under my pillow
And a Glock on top of my dresser
My bitch say I'm paranoid, and my momma think I'm special
But fuck them, I can't trust nobody but Dan Wessern
Its a, cold game, they only know me by my code name
Agent 187, smobbin ?? sprayin cocaine

[Chorus]

[Killa Tay]
Damging bodies is a hobby they try to stop me but i mash hard
Livin on the run like a track star so why act hard
You know we packin when its time for some action
These niggas never see me like revy jackson
We be taxin they ass like IRS, I bring death
They call me the grim reaper, creepin and sneakin em with the left
Till they tone death my tank on F, I smash out
I ain't no punk smokin dope blunts till I pass out
I'm a rida, I love my momma mayne I'm puttin in work
And doin dirt, skeet skirt, off the block, fuck the cops
I'm the bully on the block, with fully on the spot
When you see us ain't no love, we some thugs on the block
Watch, these papers gone turn
Before the burn my im connected like a crooked attorney
My money dirty like a football jersey at halftime
Cause a nigga on a savage ass rhyme poppin my 9 for my past time
But now I make mine the honest way
Can't let em fuck me like they did my folks Anerae
My momma say im in too deep, but i can't change
And it seem like my baby boy gone grow up doin the same thang
Gotta gang bang, gotta maintain
Caught up in this thug shit, busta catch a slug quick
It ain't no love trick
I got hoes, from the crest side to the east side O'
We get a sack and hit the track and ride slow thug livin nigga

[Chorus till end]
I ride for my niggasVerse 1 (Killa Tay)
We pump slugs, and punk thugs for their drugs
When push come to shove ain't no motherfuckin love
Bow down, we just hit the town
But we brung shit like Hitler, bail em with a Sigma
Switch with the first shot, gotta check the spot
Burnin rubber out the parkin lot, pointin out the window
Stuck off indo, bumpin my nigga C-Bo
Bitches all in my business cos they think I move kilo's
I, call my people's on the mobile, gang global, nationwide distribution
Now I'm posted up in Houston
Texas, ridin a Lexus but it's supremo
Niggas set trippin, so a solo weapon is essential
Keep the pepper spray on my car keys, only fuck with hard Gz
Still get my ball on like Barkley
Nothin but the California hog in me
Touchin triggers, real niggas, straight doggin freaks

Chorus:

Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?

Verse 2 (JT the Bigga Figga)
We take the occupation when movin, my hustle never stop
Check what? Some babies camera's peep the blocks, stash the Glocks
Posi's squashed, ship ki's and here there's thousand dollar bidders
Rim hats with feathers, more money than Perry Ellis
Never known behind ???, talkin "let my nuts hang"
Trade ya the .4-5 and the Tek 9 for a drop Mustang
A long line of killers, drug dealers with stripes
Just schoolin, you're rollin pontentially, could take your advice

(C-Bo)
We count big face and straight laces by the hundreds
Ragtops and big blocks, gettin the money
Sippin X-O Hen, and I get it for the 1-10
In a convertible Benz, fearin hunted, on twins
They call me Bo-Loc, and fo' sho' I smoke the dodo
And flip the '97 Sport to shake the po-po
High rollers count, tall dollars will never fall
In this shit for the cash nigga, enter, forever ball

Chorus

Verse 3 (C-Bo)
We are surprised in this rap game
Straight gangsta shit makes the world go round, I'm nuttin nice
On a dice, bets are more wet and crush ice
X-O, stretch Rolls, Bza's and Lexo's
And fuck the best hoes, and never slippin like Magic Johnson
Keeps my top down, increase my hatto, from Sac to Compton
Rolex down, fools shot up, solid ice
The gin in the cask was still followed by the vice
In the S-Class, we does it on the gas
On my cell, Bo poppin my collar, all about my cash
How many diggers can you scat? Now picture that
Without the feds on your back, homey, and that's a fact
We attack with Mac 1-12's to protect my sack
I pick up my pack, tellin the order "handle that"
It ain't no room for you busters cos we knuckle ya downfall
Player haters, fuck y'all, let these ballers all ball

Chorus:

Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Tell me, can we ball?I'm on a mission for money, dreams n' Bentleys n' Ferrarris
Influenced by the biggest ballas now bitches wanna call us
Picture me with all the cheese mansion lookin overseas
Pushin limosuines n' stackin hunits n' g'z
Dubbz on my sports car six car garage
Its like a mirage when you step off my back yard
Rollies whinnin diamonds shinnin I'm gettin mine
Them models you see on TV fuckin em' all the time
Zippin on $200 bottles of champainge
Till I'm dead in the game won't a damn thang change
I'm a boss bitch thats why I floss bitch
And we leave from the club you gettin tossed bitch
Besta believe I'm a thug keep it crackin n' stackin my mill
Taller than (??) (??) n' roll like a back down
Fuck goin' back to jail
Bitch I'm back to the hotel in my V12 wit mo' kill

[Hook]
Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6
Twenty inch rims with the all chrome kit
Ballin like king tut two rollies
Mac like goldies somebody better hold me
Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6
Twenty inch rims with the all chrome kit
Ballin like king tut nigga what
Two rollies somebody better hold me

You see me sliddin up not givin a fuck we done been up
Throwin up the mob down the block so bring it up
I be flossin in my Mercedes wit yo lady
Got her tossin zippin on Baileys we do it daily
It ain't NOOOO bitch livin up on this earth that can play me
It ain't NOOOO snitch livin up on this earth that can hate me
I be sideways shakin dick up on the highway
Havin it my way I think it was a Friday better yet a Thursday
Thinkin about the first day my CLK went to hit the bay
It was a true figga young mob figga make mans skrilla
Gettin close up on the trigga
Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6 seee
TVs in the back seat
Now police wanna catch me
Cuz I'm livin large $80,000 cars
A young ghetto star no matter who you are

Chorus

I put dubbz on my Benz got my 64 lifted
Swimmin in money because I'm gifted
Livin the life of a rap star Bentleys n' double R's
Ride luxury cars flossin wit allstars
Catch me overseas counting g'z and they hate it
Mad cuz a thug nigga done made it
Wanna see me down and out bank account on rip
You players haters you can suck a fat dick
I put the gat to yo lip breath smellin like shit no breathin
To the wizard of oz hard courage is what you needin
Beat up n' get up out it before I draw down
Wit a 44 caliber desert eagle got shit locked down
Like a dog pound and we all down
For that dubb C L mafia loc
Ain't no stoppin us loc
Not unless you poppin us loc
I'm a floss across town like the president
Flip a yay and dont touch no evidence
Baller Style!

Chorus

[Killa Tay]
I'm a cap pilla you fuckin wit some real killas
Ride through my 9 milla on cock like a dike bitch
I'm bellin it tight bitch
My profile ain't rightous I'm a thug lord
I got whatever you need like a drug store
Hard core killin off all enimies
Them dollies crackin speed knum you on my g'z
I be ballin like Rasheed Wallace but fuck college
All a nigga need is my heat and some of this street knowledge
Get some dollas straight thuged out
Put up in yo chest n' still holla all in my mouth tryin to get popped out
But I burn rubber on hood rats we ridin high speed
Cuz I like to drop E off Remy and weed
I'm through the town like the HIV
Regulatin strikin dirty wit a fake ID
Instead of hatin I be chassin this paper hard status
Its in my nature still copin kids never potin licks wit no fakies

Chorus[ VERSE 1: JT The Bigga Figga ]
We play hardball, runnin these streets in different routes
Make the paper count, stuffed in the couch, we got clout
All I talk about is cheddar-chasin, we in the Jets
In a parking lot in a bubble goose rockin a vest
So we mean-muggin, whole trunk full of goodies
Burner gloves, Timbos, Levis and the hoodies
I'm in and out of B-210, juice & gin
Crack the window when you smokin them bidi's, pass the Hen
Overdrive in the passenger side, my niggas ride
For the westside, 415, ????
By the look in his eyes, you never been around the block though
Bustin off rounds or crack dealin to keep it hot tough
Dancin with the shift, get skirtin, illegal motion
Stoppin for the cops and it's curtains, so keep coastin
When they dust for prints ain't no punks in this
And if they ever bring the drama get the pumps for this

[ Chorus: Cosmo ]
We ain't got shit to lose but much to gain
We young thugs who done felt much pain
Drug dealers who touched caine
Stuck in the game like 'fuck fame'
Makin weak cats tuck they chains
Ain't nothin changed

[ VERSE 2: Killa Tay ]
I serve a punk quick like Serena and Venus
Foul language, broken English, but my style's the cleanest
I was born on the East but I reside on the West
Officially Supernatural, so I ride to the death
Express my plans to my fans, put my spirit in lyrics
Eternal threats after a mic check, let the whole world hear it
They call me Mister Mafioso, the one and only
Runnin a mob, gettin the job done, no love for the phoneys
I'm representin WCM to the fullest, my nigga
Pullin strings like a trigger, posted up with the stigma
I lay my hat somewhere in ???? protectin my family
My homies ain't understandin me cause they live in a fantasy
I got deep ties and I'll keep wise, respect from the West to the Eastside
These gees ride just to put it down in my British Knights and my Levis
But now we all O.G., livin casual, ready to travel
Ain't no equal to this God Mob crew, who wanna battle?

[ Chorus: Cosmo ]

[ VERSE 3: Cosmo ]
We livin in the last days where gats spray
Hittin cats from blocks away
Crooked cops tryin to stop the pay
They think we rockin lley
Tryin to monitor the ways that we operate
Cause we won't cooperate
We stay large, we break jawbones and get our ball on
On the block hustlin dope till it's all gone
I'm almost all grown, I got a .380 Beretta and it's all chrome
I know I'm all wrong for all the thug livin and drug dealin
I put my ears to the streets but all I'm hearin is these slugs peelin
When they come killin ain't no words fo'
All you seein is beanies, black pistols and herb smoke
Dirty money wrapped in rubberbands
Young killas dyin over scrilla, I heard he went out over a hundred grand
Penitentiary cells blocks
Is full of young thugs who ain't got no choice but to sell rocks
I know my future was planned for me to succeed
I'd die to see my homie G-Spot and mama live free
A lotta suckers wanna get me, plottin on seein me
Dead, got they Glocks aimed for my kidneys

[ Chorus: Cosmo ](lunasicc)
I remember back in the days we used to live so right
Not word about a thang just ridin my bike
Clicked up with the homies at the school house ballin
After dark I hear my teacher at the front door callin
I ain't leavin til I hit this J sittin in my mouth
Walkin home hella high passed out on the couch
Those were the dayz dead now things did change
Takin dibs and yellin out young thugs names
Tappin phones tappin homes best watch yo back
Get gd up in your life stop worshipin scratch
Leave the dope game alone and find your way back home
Give love to the thugs that are passed and gone

(chorus)
Been so long I miss my homies
Been so long I really miss my homies
We keep eachother strong they never left me lonely
Been so long I really miss my homies

(killa tay)
There are so many homies to this game
But will it change got me goinin the same livin the range ????? the brain
Feelin the pain
Wonderin if ill ever see my G's again
Dependin on god to GLD when I need a friend
Resistin to take been on my own since my childhood
Pourin out some hennesse of memory of enale wood
Prayin for peace but still these streets gettin worse
We livin revalation so I'm headed back to church
Ajusted my mind remainded ricuse raisin my sons
Officially made no more stressin we infested in funds
Im still thuggin money can't change me
Still free until I'm six feet deep I rest in piece

(chorus)

(marvaless)
Rememberin some times
About the old school days
When we was rippin verses
Strictly for the love of the game
Talent shows were the thang
And all the sessions were packed
You had to raise out the stop if you were weak on the rap
Put the beat box in the back movin the crowd was the thing
Servin them all with the dream
No matter how bad it seemed
Kept our eyes on the prize
Always strivin for more
Raise up in the ghetto
Fast times strugglin, bubblin and losin
Half way we be choosin
Missin all my homies restin six feet
Always keep your name in the streets
Make sure they know how we did it
Until  we meet on the other side
Ride fo the cause and blaze one for you
Til we meet again stya up and tru

(chorus)*(Ager Man talking)*

Sacramento loc, all the way to Fresno nigga
It's Ager Man, Lunasicc, an Killa Tay
Top dolla bitch. We get paid ho

Verse 1 *(Lunasicc)*

Uh, prepare to bow down when I hit yo shit, danger
Multipule rounds when the caliber spit
Like my folks BO I mash on tracks to get the paper
Money by the ton stack the loot as high as a skyscraper
I'm makin moves, doin you fools wit the tech
When it all goes down these AWOL niggas get respect
Yo threats don't mean shit everythangs on a bitch
Twins on a BM-dub O, AMG chrome kit
I rush up in yo face, no doubt I bring the pain
Unstoppable when I drop my load get smacked like a run away train
I do kick it wit real niggas from Sac-Town, thought you knew
Like my folks Yuk, I blast on fools so I
Dish the body smash off wit my posse bangin the curb
Young phsyco wit the ghetto bible I'm bringin the word
Sicc, Tay, an Ager Man out to do big thangs
Top dollaz y'all, now mutha fucka can you hang??!!

Chorus *(Lunasicc)* x2

Top dollaz, nigga can you hang wit my team??

Verse 2 *(Ager Man)*

I got yo punk ass yellin.... AHHH!!
Wit a phat ass strap in yo mouth, the gat in yo mouth
Got you swallowin crack in yo mouth
Pistol whippin to knock yo punk ass out
An go fo tha scratch in yo house
That's why I never keeps stacks in my house
Back at that ass point blank range
None of you mutha fuckin bitches wanna cross this game
I hear you bumpin that Krazy shit
Tired of the pain, I fuck wit assassins
Killaz that'll blow out yo fuckin brains
Eastside til I die, I'm hittin on the gas
Sumpthin fo that ass ho, sumpthin fo that ass
Heaters under the two seater Benzo wit tinted glass
9 millimeter on my lap, shit some puff I'm ready to blast
Full of traps, hopin that my gun don't get smoked
If I go broke, he bring me back
I'm deep in this game of sellin dope
These niggas out here be strapped
This nigga right here be strapped wit a mini
Open fire on yo bitch ass, tough love that I'm sendin
Test the testicals, serve the team an I'm grippin
The ho from Oakland to Lick Mode
Wit a four-four, searchin til the day I go all out fo the cash
An be out like nuthin, ever happened, I'm smashin
On the gas it's murder shit, this goes further than rappin
Dealt wit the jackin, empty yo pockets time to pay yo turf taxes
After the blastin if you niggas get to flashin
We puttin hot ones in yo asses
3 Times fo you mutha fuckin niggas
Doin it to you in yo ear, say what I can wit a can of beer
Top dollaz, when the double O block
An the four-four stop, when a nigga pop, cowards
It's Ager Man, an Lunasicc surrounded by money an power
You know, you know, you know, it goes down, uh game

*(chorus)* x2

Verse 3 *(Killa Tay)*

Got the mic I'm gettin freaky like a demon Nina
Millimeter my weapon when I'm steppin through yo section
Strictly fo protection
Wreckin, checkin, disrespectin niggas bigga than me
Stoppin yo family, plot yo death like Brandon Lee
Million dolla Mobb hits, Mobb shit, bustaz all die
Wipe the bitch made g's off the mack strap when I ride
High, power fuck a coward
Top dollaz cuz I'm bout it
While you hatin I be celebratin, elevatin my mind
Off that bomb green, no visine, eyes red like blood clots
Get off in that ass like buckshots
Pockets phat like Chubb Rock
Shiney gold medalins no more freestylin
It's all about these pay styles
Gotta get mine, now we ballin big time
Still throwin them clips down from the Bay down to South Central
Bout my riches, dodgin bitches like a base half rental
No reason fo squeezin the trigga
These niggas is goners, insane fo the skrilla

Bringin em pain, all off in the game, top dollaz, uh

*(chorus)* x3

Money (money)

Top dollaz biatch!(Verse 1)
(Killa Tay)
Whoever took the wrong path, 28 havin long cash
Tired of goin past my baby boy growin fast
Look in his eyes I know he ready to ride
With homicide on his mind cuz ain't no peace to find
I'm on the front line battlin demons with verbal weapons
With my heat release I see 'em runnin for protection
No question, I do the checkin with perfection
I stay clockin G's got the trees for the section
Incredible not, that nigga Sean T lace the beats
And now we comin with enough game to change the streets
And I ain't trippin off the fame it's all the same to me
I need my money cuz nothin in life came for free
I used to life the thug life and pack a chrome
Hustled 24/7 'till my sac was gone
Little kids on my block gettin blasted on
But it's a cold world baby and we all shady
White man tryin to tell me I'm crazy and lock me up
Got me fucked up with both hands cuffed
Feelin stuck, 'till my heartbeat cease I'm reppin C-Fold
Nothin to live for, so much to die for livin the life of a psycho

(The Commissiona)
Until I speak of the truth I feel a mil ticket's gettin closer
The Gambino's nigga we certified souljah's
I been laced in the game back in the late 80's
And now it's the year 2001
Some crucial on frontline, tryin to stay away from one time
Ridin off into the sunset
You taught your whole dealy and come to the game tryin to compete with us
Or ride with us we leavin niggas speechless
Speak in the heat of all speeches
We 30 deep in this game, we hustle hard and got G's to gain
Make a large amount of paper nigga larger than life
Behind this click nigga The Commissiona I got geez to get

(Chorus X2-JT The Bigga Figga)
I got geez to get, P's to flip
Turned off my phone cuz it's hot as a bitch
I know they watchin on the block but I couldn't beleive
When the homies try to tell on me

(Verse 2)
(Cosmo)
We makin moves, my team too strong we can't lose
Head up against the world take a walk in my shoes
And you gon' see why I act this way
Gettin Low with some real G's stackin the pay
I'm wakin up fresh off the flight, still hung over from last night
Nothin on my mind but the grind and gettin my cash right
And my vision, I got plots and plans for multimillions
So I can go cop a new Benz when I get the feelin
Makin a killin, off this here rap that I'm dealin
With my cash stacked up to the ceiling
I'm gettin money rockin more bottles and gold lynch to hang to my balls
Dip in act flip stacks to pay for my dogs
That got lost in this cold life
I got tired of workin cold nights and hangin on the block with no fight
I'm thinkin that I might get, slapped and jacked
Facin 25 to a L what type of life is that
I know the shit wasn't meant for me
I'm Young Pachino born floss on you bitches, ballin with Gambino's
Who got nothin to lose
Grabbin my dick, flippin off the world clutchin my tools, make ya lose

(JT The Bigga Figga)
This California lifestyle was dope by the Pound
My nigga wild when it's high profile
We through the aisles, checkin for Beamer's and Benz's
Searcher in this, for the right one took a strike 'em it's kinda nice son
Cuz we the tight ones, collar poppin to get the pesos
Sacks of dego, stack the cheddar just like the Lego
About to take ov'
We need to reach for your profile and, platinum medallion
Steppin out spaceships with stallions
Next turn your eyes glance up at the bosses
Niggas is cautious, of these hataz they see us flossin
Camouflage my souljah's sit in a garage
Tinted, my niggas in it with 2 more guys
I got the mind of a hustler, a tongue of a pimp
Keep my mind on my money gotta ride for the click
We certified from the rap game known to keep it crack game
West Coast Mafia nigga sittin on stacks mayn

(Chorus X4-JT The Bigga Figga)
I got geez to get, P's to flip
Turned off my phone cuz it's hot as a bitch
I know they watchin on the block but I couldn't beleive
When the homies try to tell on meThis game
Is to be sold not told
Pay styles, pay pay styles
Pay styles, pay styles
Feds tappin in on shit
You know, playin hard ball

(Killa Tay)
I never liked to sign autographs, I mash for all the cash
My third eye shine like brass, my life flash
I blast, when I ride past, pervin and swervin
Off the cream soda and bourban, puttin in work like service
It ain't no get back punk, my mini spit back chunks
Won't be caught up in no scandal, we gon' handle the funk
I'm representin for the Yay cause, ain't no love
For none of these pretty-boy ballers, they just some fake thugs, wit a Yay plug
We them niggas runnin up yo house regulatin
Do or die, down for the scrilla, we cheddar chasin
Momma gave birth to a killa, premeditatin
????, ready to resurrect my thug nation
Creepin while they sleepin like gorillas in the mist
In Y2K hits, my niggas spray shit
Every solution, it's revolution, so we all shootin
Fuck the system, I refuse to be the victim of an execution
It's ??? from prison, that I'm tryin to stay livin
And givin no gloved out, we thugged out
Until the death of me, I'm thinkin bout some treachery
On the click I get sick, like a nigga wit leprosy
When they step to me
It's smash murder

Hook (C-Bo)
It's Hard Ball, yard call, up against the wall
People my enemies envy me, write on the walls
Wit ya life in draws, blue bandanas and stand tall
When the dope pop unlock, it's war til we fall
(Repeat)

(Killa Tay)
Twistin tongues, get em sprung, like the crack rock
I gets love from the gardens to the Mac block
I ride hot wit my strap cocked, coast trippin
Started servin stones, now we rappin for chickens
Bloody victims, camouflaged in ditches
I'm ridin wit the little homie, dodgin you bitches
Mobbin these switches, bouncin through the light in the rain
My niggas mafia connected, spendin life in the game
No turnin back, we burnin sacks, to try to deal wit the pain
Before the feds shoot me dead, I put the steel in my brain
I bet they bury me a down ass G, so until I see
Prison or hell, I'm thug livin for mail
Wit clientele from the ATL back to the Bay
I bubble up, to servin double ups, back in the day
Mr. Packin still got the spot, crackin today
Unpluggin niggas, mean muggin niggas, passin the J
My block, I keep my squad tight, we make them nights
Ridin dirty through the MIA, shakin vice
Murder all hoes that go in my way, protect my life
Wit these warfare machinery, high blowin greenery
Touch em like a comedy
Tickle the spine, twist they mind like Geometry
On my momma I'm a G
Any shit that benefit, I represent
Like a Nazi, til somebody pop me
Throw up the dub

Hook 2x

(Killa Tay)
It's been a long time, the West Coast got it crackin now
I'm smokin MC's like Black & Mild
Tryin to copycat my rappin style
Bomb status, savage tactics, gettin my money stacked in piles
I flow like the Nile River, living sermon like a preacher
In the pull pit, still pack a full clip
Told you I'm a fool bitch, I stay high
Killa T-A-Y, and hear the pound down for the drive-by
These G's ride, and it ain't no fear in my heart
You talkin loud, wolfin threats, but I know you a mark
Playa hatin so I'm waitin, for the ride to start
I come creepin like a ninja when it's quiet and dark
We playin hard ball, so if you soft step off
Cause ain't no hoppin up outta this game, once these shots let off
We rippin they heads off for tryin to cross
Attackin like a wolfpack, I push back brains, you know my name
It's the K-I-double L-A-T-A-Y, call me the Locsta
Can't be runnin up in these stank routes, and my bank fat like Oprah
Gank sacks to smoke off, we all high
If the funk jump, we Loc up cause, we all ride
You know my niggas down for the homicides and rapes
Po-po catch me bailin, while I'm sellin these tapes
I make my money legit.......Sike!
I'm makin G's pushin ki's, and bustin raps on the mike
We chippin weed at the studio, what's crackin tonight
I hear the Lord callin my name, tryin to get back in my life
I see the devil's face deep in my dreams, lookin friendly
But I recognize the public as my enemy
Cause I'm coast trippin

Hook 2x

Yeah, West Coast Mafia
For my real folks
Everybody else suck a dick

When the dope pop unlock, it's war til we fall
(Repeat)

(Killa Tay)
Twistin tongues, get em sprung, like the crack rock
I gets love from the gardens to the Mac block
I ride hot wit my strap cocked, coast trippin
Started servin stones, now we rappin for chickens
Bloody victims, camouflaged in ditches
I'm ridin wit the little homie, dodgin you bitches
Mobbin these switches, bouncin through the light in the rain
My niggas mafia connected, spendin life in the game
No turnin back, we burnin sacks, to try to deal wit the pain
Before the feds shoot me dead, I put the steel in my brain
I bet they bury me a down ass G, so until I see
Prison or hell, I'm thug livin for mail
Wit clientele from the ATL back to the Bay
I bubble up, to servin double ups, back in the day
Mr. Packin still got the spot, crackin today
Unpluggin niggas, mean muggin niggas, passin the J
My block, I keep my squad tight, we make them nights
Ridin dirty through the MIA, shakin vice
Murder all hoes that go in my way, protect my life
Wit these warfare machinery, high blowin greenery
Touch em like a comedy
Tickle the spine, twist they mind like Geometry
On my momma I'm a G
Any shit that benefit, I represent
Like a Nazi, til somebody pop me
Throw up the dub

Hook 2x

(Killa Tay)
It's been a long time, the West Coast got it crackin now
I'm smokin MC's like Black & Mild
Tryin to copycat my rappin style
Bomb status, savage tactics, gettin my money stacked in piles
I flow like the Nile River, living sermon like a preacher
In the pull pit, still pack a full clip
Told you I'm a fool bitch, I stay high
Killa T-A-Y, and hear the pound down for the drive-by
These G's ride, and it ain't no fear in my heart
You talkin loud, wolfin threats, but I know you a mark
Playa hatin so I'm waitin, for the ride to start
I come creepin like a ninja when it's quiet and dark
We playin hard ball, so if you soft step off
Cause ain't no hoppin up outta this game, once these shots let off
We rippin they heads off for tryin to cross
Attackin like a wolfpack, I push back brains, you know my name
It's the K-I-double L-A-T-A-Y, call me the Locsta
Can't be runnin up in these stank routes, and my bank fat like Oprah
Gank sacks to smoke off, we all high
If the funk jump, we Loc up cause, we all ride
You know my niggas down for the homicides and rapes
Po-po catch me bailin, while I'm sellin these tapes
I make my money legit.......Sike!
I'm makin G's pushin ki's, and bustin raps on the mike
We chippin weed at the studio, what's crackin tonight
I hear the Lord callin my name, tryin to get back in my life
I see the devil's face deep in my dreams, lookin friendly
But I recognize the public as my enemy
Cause I'm coast trippin

Hook 2x

Yeah, West Coast Mafia
For my real folks
Everybody else suck a dick
Nigga this Fresno
Penzoni for life nigga
All the rest is phonies
Big ballin respect that[Killa Tay]
Take it, how you want it, tre deep gettin blunted, in a circle
Purple haze, got me in a daze, evil ways
We blaze back to back, puttin' it down L.A. to Sac
Cali 'til I die bitch, all about my scrilla scratch
Fuck a ho fa' sho', unless she tryin to do some dirt
I got to patch it down, wit' a triple deuce
Another strap up under the shirt, see
She might fuck one of the homies
But I can't sweat that, pussy got more miles than Southwest Airlines
Walkin' like a penguin, but she bringin home
Fat stacks, so daddy can't complain
But if she get shady I takes a bitch up out the game
Same, shit different day
Hit the liquor store, spend it, it wasn't my intention, but end up swervin'
Cause I'm pervin', servin', corners, on the way to pick this broad up
Po-po see mobbin, a nigga done fucked around and got caught up
But ain't tryin' to see no jail cell
Still ain't got no L's, but fool I got my strap
And a zip of hydro weed, I'm kied down for the high speed
In a V8, automatic shakin' the P's
Like Dukes of Hazard, murder gettin' colder, moves up tonight
Im lettin' 'em have it, murder
Ain't nothin' but a thang to me, we just some thugs
On the grind, livin' dangerously
I cut my perm off, switched up my name again
Nuts danglin, can't trust this game I'm in, the shit is faulty
So a nigga be on the down low, off indo
Same shit different day, young killa tay
Gettin' that cash flow, we riders

[Chorus: Mississippi]
I can't sleep at night, things just ain't right, I see faces, lookin down on me
I can't sleep at night, things just ain't right, I see faces, lookin down on me

[Killa Tay]
See I scheme and plot, on my dreams in life
Sometimes I wake up to gun shots
Aimed at me, I never claimed to be, to great to touch
I'm livin' dangerously, and ain't nobody to trust
I'm doin way too much, but I dont give a fuck
We can keep it real, and get 'em up, or we can buck
No love lost, you know I never been a punk
Better hide your newborn, if your family got funk
It's on, watch your front, watch your back
Cause I be creepin from the blindside
Peelin caps, got 'em sleepin with they lights on
Thus runnin through your house
Like a cyclone, duck and cover
But I pop 'em like a rubber in the process low profile
No smiles, wild, wild west, we shoot 'em up, on every track, murder mind
Every time, Make 'em take it back, hit rewind
Til its broke, we smoke rope I got the plug
Now my folks got the most dope, around March of 97's when the drop hits
But all my niggas still flippin' new outfits, im tryin' to get a grip
Ballin' like a 1st round draft pick, fuck what you heard about, nigga
This is cash click, bitch!, down and dirty 'til I get rich
I, wet 'em up like liquids when I spit this lyrical sickness
(my evil ways)

[Chorus]

[Killa Tay]
Mr. Mafioso, thats what they call me
Style hella saucy, back the fuck up off me
They die if they cross me, death is what they ask fo'
Fuck wit my cash flow
Blast your ass, and bend the block
Be prepared when it cock, cause I never miss
I'm the type of nigga, make a white man prejudice, keep it underground
Never switchin' up on you, bring your strap
And some scratch if you come to California
Cause money talks, bullshit walks, and hoes gaffle, west coast mafia
Ballin wit no askin, busters in my mix
Actin hard, nigga give me that, get the game twisted
I'ma smoke 'em like a 50 sack, never shed a tear
Even when my close folks died
But ain't no tellin when its time for a homicide
Retaliation is a must where I come from
Me and my nigga Sip be lettin' 'em have it
So if you want some, come get some

[Chorus][Intro]

[JT the Bigga Figga]
We low-key - city streets, we on the under
Bring thunder, bomb beats for hot summers
We at this, in and out just like a robbery
Break bread, lay down slow because ya bother me
Stressed out, ghetto shots the metal hot
When the cats get to buckin and shit, peep the pot
Camoflauge in the buckets we ride, get up inside
On the other side, now we collide, it's Westside
Certified, I make it happen for my real folks
Representin Fillmoe, we make them hits
All the way to the L.B., cuz them niggas tell me
They be gettin they grits

[Chorus: JT] - 2X
We put it down for the real folks
L.B. to Fillmoe - you can't fuck with this!
And when it come to the tips
Westcoast represent y'all - all we make is hits!

[Daz Dillinger]
I'm lookin ghetto fab, coordinated with some G shit to bang
Twenty cents on the hang, ain't a fuckin thang
The Bigga Figga Dilli ride the city gettin greedy
Ohh what a pity, smokin sweets and switchin Philly's
I get off the chain, get loose sip juice
On my way get down 'fore I start to produce
I need a valet my frame of mind is madly
Ohh how can I be happy when the feds tryna jack me
They try to get at me and they try to get me
Nothin but G's is ridin with me, all the bullshit can miss me
Westside, Eastside, we ride slide and die
For the cause baby girl, be fuckin her out of her drawers
She know me from back in the days, I get the cabbage
Dat Nigga Daz gots to have it, haha!
I'm a motherfuckin hustler, busts on busters
Fuck all y'all suckers and ride on motherfuckers

[Hook: JT] - 2X

[JT the Bigga Figga]
Man it's more like nuttin to lose, and a lot for me to gain on
I stayed back waitin my turn and got my game on (Game on)
We're not a spotlight, shine every rhyme
Maybe only cuz that's how us niggas came on
I'm in the same zone of the twilight, livin the high life
And I gotta rhyme tight, man cuz all my fuckin fans
I'm puffin on grams, until a niggas nearly can't see
For tape three I can't come weak, I'm at my peak
Do a hundred thou a week, through the streets
Got us ready to start collectin 'fetti, swing cars like Andretti
Heavy chips that Tha Gamblaz flip, when we hit
Like the '89 quake, that shook the fuckin Bay
Day to day is what I'm talkin 'bout, who the fuckin tightest?
You know about Tha Gamblaz, G.L.P., Frisco's Finest
Diamond cut records and beats, nuttin sweet
When I speak, only represent for the elite
We play for keeps, fast cars and jeeps, for all my peeps
Clearin up the Billboard charts, on a single sweep
No retreat, I keep the heat, waitin in my notebook
50 bar rhymes with no hooks

[Killa Tay]
They say my mind's in the sky cuz I'm high as a kite
I see the devils run for cover when my people unite
Tryna get my thug life right, and change the way we all think
Finally found the missing link (What is it?)
God is real, I felt the touch
No way to ignore that I recognize
Ain't no money from the third eye, so why lie?
Expectations sky high, then we all die, but the game won't change
So many curses, so many hearses, stuck in my brain
I know the way God works, took me 28 years
To finally face all fears and see my real life clear
I near thug heaven pledgin allegiance to my livin
And the feds can't hate, they know my talent's God-givin
Never been to prison, I'm supernatural for real
Remainin military minded, with a passion to kill
So if the revolution pop off, I'm ready and deadly
I dare any one of you peckerwoods to play with my 'fetti
So feel the fury flow, the planet revolves around me
And now I'm thuggin more than sucker-free
I pray for strength to keep my mind right
Eternal limelight, still in my sight
But now I see straight, my B.G.'s can't re-late
Cuz I'm high-powered...[Killa Tay]
I'm at the point of no return, fuck what you talkin'
I want money like Big Worm, I ain't tryin' to get burned
I learned the hard way so now everyday is a holiday
It's dirty, but it's the game that we gotta play
It's all the same from L.A. to the Bay
??? full of pot heads chasin' the pain
They say the streets ain't safe, so everybody ride strapped up
??? got it locked, locked the block it's like that
I got goons posted up at the room
Still coming home smellin' like gun powder and perfume
Still real from the womb to the tomb
I bring goons, still riding, signing autographs shining like the moon
Step wrong,I light up your life like Pat Goon
Don Dada when the gat boom
Read the headlines, niggas doin' fed time stuck in the prison
That ain't livin', I know you probly felt like snitchin'
But read what you saw that's what the good book tell us
If you ain't M-O-B, you either shook or you jealous
Cause we ain't playin' with Pellut Guns, you suckas keep bumpin' ya guns
So now you finally gettin' fucked like Nuns
It's halocaust, we gon' hall 'em off
All that floss got you headed on a one way trip to a coffin
Fuck talkin' I'm walkin' front line with Bo
Until my shine don't glow or it's my time to go
But...

(Talking about the Mafia)

[Yukmouth]
Geah.. nigga
Spark the ganja up, H2 Tonka truck
26 deep dish make my shit look like a monster truck
Gettin' swallowed up by a gangsta bitch, Gobble up
Y'all be givin' dollas up for pussy, Bitches sponsor us
In the Mob we trust it's the Mafia, La Kosta Nostra
Lots of Coke and lots of Doja, Lots of Souljas
Mobstas focus, in drops and Rovers
Front work to the block controlla, let him rock 'n roll ya
Carson Daly, flossin' daily, and drive Mercedes it ain't all gravy
Fuck y'all pay me, cross the Mob lose your broad and baby
Police they all hate me, I ball like McGrady
And I'm the one like "Neo", still Desert Eagle
Keep throwin' bricks like Shaquille at a free throw
Yuk and C-Bo the sequel
Made niggas that'll have ya wacked like the Beatle in Casino
Nigga...

(Talking about the Mafia)

[C-Bo]
Got the Benz on 20's, the Porsche on 19's
10 Millimeter clips extended to 19's
Ya never ever cross a killa that's like me
Tank top, white tee, jeans and Nike's
Bangin' since the first day Reagen got elected
Yeah, since the first day AIDS got detected
I ain't got a problem with touchin' or bustin' it's nothin'
Like AIDS, ya get it like ??? Huston
The vest won't protect ya, it just slow ya down
Let the gauge racket go up, bet it blow you down
When it come to my money don't play ho
You'll have us on your ass like the attack of the killer tomatos
I was born with a halo, turned into horns
Said I was evil my every step would burn through the floor
I'm tired of life, my every turn is to the morgue
Ya little sister grew up in church and turned into a whore...

(Talking about the Mafia)All rap for everybody, West Cola
Open up my 3rd eye, let my spirit speak
Time to re-unite the family
Military Mind, searchin for thug heaven
Bullys wit Fullys

{Verse 1}
Scrutinize my roots, and recognize the troops
I'm still a G with exceptional capabilities
I know they plottin on killin me, but it's checkmate
Snake eyes, venomous tongue increasin death rates
It ain't no love in this blood sport, county support is all we need
So many lost souls blinded by the liquor and weed
I made a change in my life and got some get right
Finally livin decent, no more creepin after midnight
I respect the words that my grandfather told to me
Don't be innocent, militant is how we supposed to be
You know, God bless the child who can hold his own
Dodgin prison, still livin in my enemies zone
But I ain't scared of death, you know we all die hard
You either charge it to the game or the Mastercard
The devil lurks when we hard at work, best to pray
Cuz when my homies call I'm quick to turn back to Killa Tay
It ain't no fairy tale, the good Lord made me this way
Demon schemin on my soul to live and die in the Bay
I take steps through the valley of death
My thug religion got me pointin fingers at the system
My military mind, nine chambers deep, but still searchin for peace
M-O-B Cali G's go to church and they sneak
Don't judge me, unless we in court, for jury trial
I'm on a hunt, it's fuck season ain't no reason to smile
The first to die hard, the tragedy, agony of defeat
Military minded blinded by the sparks from the heat
It gets deep, I'm cheddar chasin, takin the fifth
I hustle heavy til my whole thug nation is rich
I put it down for Freddie Smith and Lil' Toney Loc
Cuz they real folks representin the West Coast
The Mafia Clique, I take it back to when the Feds first hit
Paranoia in my brain, but ain't no reason to trip
I come equipped ???, stick and move like Sugar Ray
Cuz it's thug life, all day every day
Killas on the payroll, my soul rest with G-o-d
But ain't no pity on my enemies, we still the realest
Let the games begin, I never die but I multiply
Buggin when the cops roll by, I'm still alive
Military mind got my fans thinkin I'm nuts
Pathetic visions til I finally touch, so let the world know

{Hook}
I declare war on the industry
I hope these Jews ain't offended, but I'm AWOL, strictly independent
If you wanna sell rap you gotta buy it from us
Soundscan ain't the truth, I know they lyin to us
It's World War 3, ain't nobody to trust
White man got a plan to see us all locked up
Instead of killin up yo own kind, focus yo mind
Check ya history, and see the signs, it's Black Power

{Verse 2}
Ain't no future in frontin hard, the young and heartless
Raised with thug methods, still subjected to the darkness
Nowhere to hide, I'm being stalked by my shadow
My spirit grow slow, but now I'm losin my homies
I see this picture white clear, ain't no love in these streets
Release my anger from the past, now I'm finally complete
I'm in a different world, livin right, my life brand new
You better recognize the real before it happen to you
My point of view is just opinion, but I'm smarter than most
And G-o-d the main reason I believe in the ghost
I know my close folks feel me, cuz my prayers been workin
I see these haters livin jealous, on the sideline smirkin
I punish enemies, they remember me, no way to forget
Cross the system, become the victim of a Mafia hit
I split the chips with my labelmates, we ballin again
Discussin hustlin with the lunatic when he call from the pen

{Hook}
I declare war on the industry
I hope my homies ain't offended, but I'm AWOL, strictly independent
If you wanna sell rap you gotta buy it from us
Soundscan ain't the truth, I know they lyin to us
It's World War 3, ain't nobody to trust
White man got a plan to see us all locked up
Instead of killin up yo own kind, focus yo mind
Check ya history, and see the signs, it's Black Power

{Verse 3}
I was dreamin but I swore I heard a voice yellin "wake up"
Tricked off half of my life, it's time to make up
I'm walkin with the Lord, speakin from the Scriptures
Had my second son, but I lost another sister
To the dope game, believe me drugs kill
And my love's real, so retrospect what a thug feel
I asked God to forgive my sins
And take the pain from my brain so I can live again
I know my grandmama spirit in me guidin me through
I know you hear them voices in ya head lyin to you
But what you see ain't true, Lord knows we need help
Ain't no knowledge being spread, all my people seek wealth
We ain't lookin for ourself, tell me where the love at?
Daddy payin child support but momma hooked on dubb-sacks
Understand my anger, I ain't no stranger to this danger
Orchestrate my clique, and it makes us a hazard

{Hook}
I declare war on the industry
I hope yo momma ain't offended, but I'm AWOL, strictly independent
If you wanna sell rap you gotta buy it from us
Soundscan ain't the truth, I know they lyin to us
It's World War 3, ain't nobody to trust
White man got a plan to see us all locked up
Instead of killin up yo own kind, focus yo mind
Check ya history, and see the signs, it's Black Power

Yeah, we gotta understand
That it's a white man's job and plan
To infiltrate anything that the Black man does
Divide and conquer
We need unity, so stop killin up yo thug nations
And direct yo anger towards the real enemy
Ride or die[151]
150 weezy what is it
Killa Tizzy what is it
Yeah, yo

Yo I done told y'all niggas before don't try me
She know I'm surrounded with K's and Mac nineties
Who really wanna find me?, come get 'em a piece
I be more than glad to show 'em all he gettin is grieve
With no relief, nigga fuck that beef shit
He better reach quick, I'm on the blind side of some sneak shit
Sedan on the deep dish, heavily tinted
Duggle bag in the trunk, heavy artillery in it
No longer lieutenant, I'm general now
I send lil niggas to combat like I'm Colin Powell
Or Donald Rumsfel, hundred round drumsfel with hollow
Squeeze off the clip make you blow like Chicago
I'm on the throttle, movin wrecklessly
Dick in the models, throw down while her neck is be
Don't pless with me, I'ma say it again
For the coroner have to notify your momma and them nigga

[Hook - Killa Tay & (MessCalen)] - 2x

I'm a soldier niga, four-five in my pocket
I put that motherfucker in ya face, nigga cock it
Second generation, do it fo' the niggas befo' me
I'm bangin this block, we ridin for the dead homies
I'm a gangsta lil daddy, I don't love no rap
I just love the way she let me fuck her ass from the back
Nigga I'm a known shooter, I pepper your face
One shot, one kill, I walk with a case
I'm a young black gangsta, with the mind of Matula
King of the underground, your boy black ruler
Have ya feelin like you comin from the Heron spot
These hot shells 'll start givin you them Heron knocks
And it ain't no squashin the drama, it's on for life
And them killas ridin with me, whether I'm wrong or right
And ain't one nigga comin, man, we all gon creep
Ain't one nigga leavin, y'all all gon sleep nigga

[Hook - Killa Tay & (MessCalen)] - 2x

[Killa Tay]
My mindstate sicker than most, It's hardball
We coast to coast gettin lit with my folks, fuck y'all
Tryin to hate on my team, ain't no way you could stop it
I stay surrounded by bosses no lossos it's all profit
I, eat good, creep through your hood and knock hoes
It's magic when I step in the booth, I got flows
I murder type beats like the mancy plan
You might, catch me at the club showin love to my fans
But understand this, I'm scandalous when it come to my chips
I rip tracks like receipts, I, never came weak
I, aim ,heat, rain, sleet, snow, sunshine
Livin the mafia live, duckin from one-time
Crime pays every seven to nine days
I put, minds in a maze, recline it with rage
Blind filthy, shinin jewelry in ya face for fun
My bomb lyrics detonate and educate your sons
I'ma show you how the west was won
California to Seattle, we the ones ain't no protection from
Second to none, record label makin it crack
Breakin in racks, full press blatin the tactics

[Hook - Killa Tay & (MessCalen)] - 4x{Killa Tay}
Murder mind like Manson, no expansion
Penitentiary chances cuz I'm scandalous, game deeper than Atlantic
Got em prayin like a mantis, but it ain't no hope though
Relentless bout this scrilla, these killas, we Mafioso
Regulate em like ho strolls, run em up off the Blocc
When the AK Poppin, I'm gone
Callin whoever I see, until I think I hear the cops comin
Mothafucka we run it, gotta punch it, got my blunt it
I'm sideways to the highway, can't be caught up in no punk shit
We run shit, from the West Coast, to the Midwest, to the South
Trigger happy like a B.G. put my streezy in yo mouth
Like toothpaste, kill em for actin two-faced
Backstabbin, they grabbin they pistols way too late
Murda 1 was the case
That they gave me, label me crazy, when we smash through
Wit a ???, leave em holy like a deacon leakin blood
Through yo teeth and meetin death, face to face, ain't no sunshine
Y'all heard the news through the grapevine
Gotta kill us all if y'all jealous G'z wanna take mine

Hook
We Blast! We killin em up, everyday, all day, we murder em up

{Marvaless}
Yeah my nigga, I heard you hollerin about you doin big shit
Fuck the complications, and fucked up situations
Bitch made nigga tactics, got these niggas wrapped up in plastic
Facin they maker, fed up wit the most unpredictable
Want it enough, well it's time that we challenge ???
So nigga what?  We in the cut, without no way to be seen
I'm blazin up, unzippin my come up, made the getaway clean
I'm fleeing the scene, and I ain't got it all anyway so let's choose
Should I think about ???? breakin yo ass, so what you gon lose
I gives a fuck about the next nigga survive ??????
Nowadays niggas is on other shit, so it's easy to plot
And I want it all, from the scrill to the bomb, to the stash in yo safe
You ain't even knowin what hit ya, you was flossin too much
Ya dividends must get touched, in all aspects I keep it real
Too much goin on in this killa field, so it's kill or be killed
Now who'd ya figure, was behind this trigga, bodyin ya cash
So I'mma smash for mine, and blast for mine
Without a trace, Murda was the case

{Killa Tay}
Murda, professional, untestable, so lethal with these weapons
Pickin em off like interceptions, causin havoc in seconds
I'm dumpin and punchin and leavin the po-po with no lead
I'm jackin and stackin and actin a fool, when it comes to my money and weed
They call me greedy like the Grinch, watch you flinch, soon as they see me
Post up wit Sicc in the cut, we hittin em up like graffiti
My money be funny, my bitches be vicious, I'm livin my life wit a grudge
Wit wicked intentions, I'm representin these G'z and these thugs
That ain't afraid to kill like Holyfield, I break em all off
No trippin cuz if the pistol ain't official I got the sawed-off
Crackin and packin, a marked-man like Sadaam, I do it my way
Runnin til my dyin day, I crush, pushin 100 on the highway
With no L's, watchin out for them jealous peepz
Gotta strap and a zip of hydro-weed but I don't need no felony
So I clear the house in 5th gear, thinkin about my young bitch
Ask these niggas who run shit
K-I-L-L-A-T-A-Y, all day nigga

We Blast! (Blast Blast!)  (Blast Blast!)[Marvaless]
Yeah, ladies first so watch me set it off, even the brothers can't touch us
Professional Ballers is what they call us, ain't no tellin who we're bailin
Kentucky, Texas, ATL strikin in a Lexus
The nigga that wanna test this
Thought this shit was shut down, thought this shit was dead like Makaveli
Cali legends keep it goin, bout this player shit I'm knowin
Haters, I know you're bumpin this shit so here's another *?daltz?*
From the Bay to the SCC, you heard us straight from California's most

[Pizzo]
We don't need no practice, no theatrics
Bout the way we be livin with the Mafia tactics, I be constantly at it
Tryin to stack my riches like Bill Gates
Servin raw and uncut caine so you can't hate
Because it angers me when niggas try to bite my ass
But we be Professional Ballers hittin at the top-notch ass
Pass the green leaf on the left, inhale a breath of chronic smoke
Exhale like a pro, I be too much for you to cope

Chorus: C-Bo

We steady countin our money, on a mission to ball
All the things we dream we wanna see before we call
So we pack heavy, push Chevy's, makin the 'fetti
If you're ready to holler at a Professional Baller
*repeat*

[Mac Mall]
Baby Capone on the loose, skywalk and fly shit
Off Paraguay, Glock in the drop plus we're hidin
Astronauts, turnin in shit for the soldiers that recop
Shoot outta state pushin killer Cali rocks
Big wreckin ball nuts and you can notify the monks
I be flossin in gators, maybe ??? ???
Tennis shoes, press our shit
Aliens gank and flew, runnin out to see you
With the loot

Interlude: Killa Tay

Yeah
West Coast Mafia, bitch
Everybody else can suck a dick

[Killa Tay]
I'm steadily tryin to get my bail on
Tapped me up on the cell phone, it ain't far
Stomped in steel toes, I look out my ??? so back up off me
The K-I-double L-A T-A-Y, call me the locster
Only smokes the bombest chronic, Professional Ballers like the Sonics
Respect game, with or without these gold chains
We're sure the West got shit sold
From the rap game to the cocaine, come get some
Got pounds like a kick drum, got hitmen
Payin em under the table, lyrics fatal like a ninja
No pretendin, we're steady ballin

Chorus

[C-Bo]
From the Valley to the Bay, I'm known for stackin chips
My 500 whip be hip with the AMG hit
'74 drop Caprice, gold ones dip
Candy-coated sport, Professional Ballers don't trip
Makin moves, pushin luxuries to ol' schools
I spit the A-1, that's why my pockets weigh a tonne
And my crew be Mafioso's, high performance and low-lows
Professional Ballers on the go and get more doe

[JT Tha Bigga Figga]
Who keep it knockin with mean choppers? My niggas keep it poppin
We're rockin, Professional Ballers, Figga-Ro will be the tallest
Player that you spot, duck or dodge?
It's all, turn the Impalas all skirty
Left em deserted, heat em where their pockets hurted
Sold it up by then, two quarters and half a flynn
With my nigga Bo-Loc in the 500 Benz
Ready to bust and make it happen fo' sho', so stack G's
With them 8-ball gangstas
And the young mack knees and that's for sheez

Chorus[Killa Tay]
I got hustle in my heart, hustle in my vain
I hustle wit my click and gotta hustle in the game
West Coast Mafia, we keepin it crackin
Deep as the Jacksons, my click stay in the midst of the action
Packin all the shows, mackin all the hoes
Stackin all the dough, make 'em wanna call the po
Real G's wit the tightest flows runnin the streets
Comin wit heat, no retreat, this game get deep
We speak in codes and ball like Jalen Rose til the end of time
We live this grind like an esse with money on my mind
24/7 Cali legend, makin paper wit Bo
My Snake Eyes glow, and I'm still puttin it down for the 'No
And K.O. so lay low, or get your chin checked like a boxer
We break 'em off proper, spray like Binaca
I still watch the time fly by on the clock
My verbal venom get up in 'em and they die on the spot

[Hook 2X: Tiffany Wilson]
It's about money, bet you I'm gon get it
Power, ain't nobody trippin
Respect, respect, respect my gangsta
My gangsta

[Spice 1]
Motherfucker I'm a villain, and nigga you's a hostage
So whenever I'm steppin, cover yo dome like an ostrich
Suckers is bleedin off this, niggas is leakin off this
You know why?  Cuz I'm a thug nigga eatin off this
Jealous, that's how they feelin eventually
That's why I pull out my pistol and bust it intentionally
Smash, that's what we do when we ride
Keep my bitches on point, and keep all my enemies hidin
It's the motherfuckin real ones, ridin for mother millions
Worldwide bosses makin decisions with precision
Thug livin on a mission, gotta stay outta prison
Hope my thug angel sittin on the star that I'm wishin

[Hook]

[Yukmouth]
Jea, jea...
I'm swingin everything from bats to gats
On the ave, I'm slangin everything from crack to wax
Tylenol, gotta grind and ball, stack my scratch
No time to stall, flip the 'Lac wit the stash wit a Mack
It's like that, outta town I got them pies and I fly back
I'm right back wit that dope wrist like an ice pack
You can't stop me, I'm too cocky
I puff broccoli in Medina Ferrari's, I'm Yuk DiBiase
On point, never see me sloppy
I'll catch a body before I let a nigga rob me at the after party
Thug Lord so I run mobs, gun high
Fill a square body up wit holes like he's Spongebob
East Oakland, Fresno to Modesto
On the block they call me Kid Rock, play wit heavy metal
And got my workers on the block slangin every pebble
Cause it's a Regime Mob nigga in every ghetto

[Hook] - 2X[C-Bo]
I'mma cock and unload the AK
Have 'em on they radio screamin out MAYDAY MAYDAY
Callin back up, I let 'em stack up
It's just more cops for me to cap up
Punk cops I kill 'em on the spot
Fuck a foot pursuit I fill 'em wit the Glock
And ever since pete wilson came up with the 3 strikes
I'd rather it be death than let it be life
I done seen wit juvenille delinquits
Pull heat quick, dump and leap fence
And I can't wait for the homies to see this
Me on the offense killin they defense
A hnudred miles and runnin
Fuck that a hundred rounds and gunnin they ass down and comin
With that titanium bullet proof vest that'll show ya
That them motherfuckers lied when they told ya

[Hook]
I'm a gun slangin d-boy block hundred proof
Fuck the police we throw shots out the roof
Heat holder, ya block soldiers cops don't want it
Shoot a cop blow a cop smoke on the doja we bad boys
We roll around the town in dem toys
Them after that we snort a gram of that boi
The savage causin the havoc
And bust a nut in nothing less than the baddest
We holdin courts in the middle of the traffic a savage nigga

[San Quinn]
I give the boys in blue the real bb king blues
Rookie cop get popped out his shoes make the news
Due to the hustlin they wanna pursue and cuff quinn
Shoot a nigga quick, so of course I'm dustin them
Since my homies a parloies they told me paperwork ain't the lick
I'm movin work in somethin quick wit a Glock and a kick
On ya shift tryna sniff in my shit
You get behind me, ya little lt-1 I'm runnin that shit
Call back up y'all stick like Savs together
So get blasted and have matchin shit, bags together
Or get chedder you can keep ya punk ass number
Fuck the cops I stay wit heat and I'm ridint he runner
If you comin bring a helicopter to chase me down to the compound
50 niggas strapped face me now
You brave bastards similar to slave masters
Try to interfere here you'll meet disaster

[Hook]

[Killa Tay]
We shake the spots cause we hate the cops
Cali life everyday tryna make some knots
My lil homies keep the blocks hot
Dub C M still hooked wit crooks that jook
And ese's wit chop shops
And ride drop tops and when it's time to blow the dough
I'm in the escalade wit bo ready to hot box
Super sav boy, keep a breezy to spot cops in case we got chops and Glocks
You know how we roll cause p.d. is dirty as me
Tryna see a real g shacked down but I'm tryna stay free
Fuck the police n.w.a said it and I said it
They lie and try to plot thats why they keep us hot headed
But we stay savage on hog status like bettis
Bout to stack a mil plus if they let us
We black geurillas that hate laws and break jaws
So if thet try to pull you over mayne shoot 'em in the face dogWest Coast Mafia

Killa Tay trick

[Killa Tay]
I never hearda these fools
I'm quick to murder these fools
Dude if you hop off on this gangsta shit
Study the rules
Or get bloody and bruised
Tied up jacked and kidnapped
My fo thugs wit no love savagely raising big straps
We git em Lloyd
Trigga finga itchy like the hemmroids
Snap you like a poloriod
Somebody better hol'ja boy
Flawless like Roy Jones
Destroy bones on contact
Life ain't shit
Witout some pussy and a bomb sack
Million Dollar contracts
Comin' and goin'
But y'all ain't knowin'
Bank account swollen
Picture me rollin'
In the Escalade
High starin death in the face
Heart fulla hate
Puttin work in but ain't catchin no case
I got my game tight
Cuz big homey, laced me as a young G
Hungry for my chedda cheeze
Pushin OZ's
Make a profit hoes
Gots to got my name in they mouth
They bumpin guns and smokin murda blunts
When the guns come out
They poppin' please don't shoot
But ain't no git back when the shit crack
Murda man like Al Capone
Bust him wit the big gat
Hit him high
Feel the ride
Ain't givin a fuck about Genocide
When this song is on
I gotta ride for mine
When the war pop off
Niggas die
Like fay days
Kill em all from the OG's to the Bebe's
When the gun blaze
Like sun rays
Doin drive by's on the run ways
Feds tryin to hunt Tay down
In every town
From Philly to Compton they investigatin
My stomach rounds

[Hook] 2x
All my niggas smuggle shit
I'm on some otha shit
Like fuckin' over the government
My ghetto politic thug niggas lovin this
Leavin u open like a hollow tip
Inside ya nigga
Swollow this
Hollow Hollow

[AP-9]
I don't give a shit
Still lettin off clips
Gimme the mike and let me touch some shit 'till I love
I get a headrush
When the lead go bust
Kickin up dust
Man that's a must
Sometimes on the mike I cuss
Kickin up dust on the mike I buss
I know my people's know who really run
Smokin' up on a Philly Blunt
Slappin' a sucka wit a gun
Crushin' up shit just like Big Pun
North to the East
South to the West
I most confess
I gotta get a piece
Betta yet a ho can't settle for less
I don't discriminate
Every fake nigga perpetrate
Concentrate on makin' papes
Shakin' fakes in the month of gate
Keepin' em as I contemplate
These high stakes wit a runnin' mate
Takin' it to another climate
For those that ever try to draw me
Rent em off to Bombay
Feelin my way
Fuck you in the hallway
My rhyme pays
'Sides Bombay
My Do or Die day nigga
Livin it up
Im givin' it up
For my niggas that been tearin shit up
Nigga What

[Hook] 2x

[AP-9]
I been doin this shit since '89
They still hatin' on debatin' on tryin' to play P-9
I see fakers on then its on
Wanna spray P-9?
All around my neck strapped tough flee
For the niggas that wanna touch me
Tryin' to fuck me
Wit' no vasoline
I get the gasoline
For niggas that's after me
5 G's is what I need on the M-I-C
Half a that before I breathe on
Niggas like you get peed on
So speed on
And be gone
To the cut with your fleet on
Or all of your teeth gone
Missin
No description until we bust
And you didn't listen
Rollin' wit the funk I think I bust cuz im thug livin'
Never give in
Nothin'
But takin' the bacon wit no mistakin'
I got some killas
On the pay roll
In day low
When it's time to handle business
Never miss it
Nigga lay low

[Hook] 2x

Fades out
