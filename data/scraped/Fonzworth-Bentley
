[Hook- Kanye West]
Everybody
Let's go!
Don't stop baby, Don't stop me
Don't stop baby, Don't stop me
I like the way that you move
And girl you know how I do

[Verse 1- Fonzworth Bentley]
It's in your hip
I want to get right between your strip
Use it like Lancome lipstick
Scarlett, and frankly I really do care, madam
All you will, this is Sa-Ra fam, now back to ma'am
I know that you can move like that I saw you dance
And now you you gotta show out, make me a fan
Turn up the fan, we gonna sweat crazy
What's your favorite Gatorade, lady
Hadn't been shopping, Perrier water maybe
I hope you ain't hungry got mash but no gravy
But we can make some, the best of both juices
We can use this, this some new shit
Make it hot like Crisco
That's how my flow go, shorty you ain't know?
If you ain't po, stop being so high post
My music ain't just for the siditty and pretty it's for

[Hook- Kanye West]

[Verse 2- Andre 3000]
Shorty you killin em hard with them lady pants
Simple elegance looking better when you dance
Chest to the sun with your thoroughbred stance
You gallop to the rhythms of a native drum chant
Your granny must be Navajo
Your mama do rodeo, your papa do the saville row
I bite you, ain't no antidotes
The red blouse do arouse, I come at you like a matador
Does attract horny bulls
All the girls are waiting to see which one he pulls
Eenie meenie miney meenie prenuptial
Enforcer in the Porsche in case fools wanna duel
You'll cool your fuckin jets, who wanna be next?
Ooh, I'll probably get life if I let
One off, so I let em go like a pro
Sir Andre with an accent 3 triple 0
Ben-jamin, Lauren is the middle name
That was given by my mama, success was on her brain
Rain? Bentley Farns got the umbrellas
Benjamin got the sweaters, hey what more can we sell em?
Sun, spring will bring the parasol
Now watch him parasail to entertain us all

[Hook- Kanye West][Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right For The Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..

[Hook]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista set +Get It Wet+
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS..

[Lil Jon]
STOP! IT'S THA MUTHAFUCKIN' REMIX!!

[Beat changes to Lil Jon's version]

[Farnsworth Bentley]
B-E-N-T-L-E-Y
Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day at they fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that for the A-Town
What...y'all...sayin?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna...stand...and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers..

[Hook]
It's been a week without me

This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk (let's see)
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk (what am I gon' wear today?)
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk (gimme them Cedar gloves)
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk (I'm goin' into my cashmere closet)
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk (I got mo' cashmere than y'all)
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk (where my trousers?)
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk (cream brown and 3 inch cuffs)
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk (where my sneakers?)
(I don't wear sneakers, I wear slippers)

[Fonzworth Bentley]
The rumor, of me in the Isuzu Trooper, fooled ya
It was a Porsche, a super duper
Charger, it wasn't Bankhead it was Boulevardin'
Wasn't Shawty it was comedian not it (uh-uh)
That wasn't my car, I was walkin', in velvet slippers
Know ya talkin' but before you do you need to know that
That's the type of brother got a castle wit' the cognac river
For a moat, I'll tell you what floats my boat
Purple silk linin', in, all of my coats
What you want? You want cashmere in the winter?
Really wanna know my worth? Wanna know my splendor?
Before, I deliver, gonna warn ya, may offend ya
Tesh and Kina this thang while you just a Simba
Watch the beak on this penguin his raps are sicker
I can weave in this lane, halogens I flicker
Foreign somethin' sittin' in the back wit' drivin' gloves and wavin' lazy

[Hook]
We gon' paint the town tonight
They gon' faint and fall in line (yeah)
Faded cause we're out of sight
Cool Outrageous Lovers Of Uniquely Raw Style

[Pimp C]
Pimp mode, meat good like pie a la mode
On parole, still keep me a calico ('co)
Never them gym clothes, cut Hilfiger ('figer)
Polo horses on my bed, pillow and spread
That girl want a wild bull between her legs
Too much game for them squares and them lames
I'm in a wet car (car) candy thang (thang)
Cologne smell good taste like a candy cane
Lane to lane (lane) brain to brain (brain)
I wrecked the Spur (Spur), it really ain't no thang
I'm in red, brand new, hoggin' the game
I got the Phantom, car's tuned true, just bought a Range
At press time hadn't dropped the album yet
Chinese girls love me long time on the G4 jet
Unh, ya hear that noise in my closet?
That's the gator tryna talk to this chinchilla tryin' to
Touch the ostrich

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Umm... microphone check twelve or just one two
I am me, who are...
And I'm one too, high, you should look, up to me
My French girls love it when we smoke the oohwee (translate)
Um bellan France, I don't when we smoke the oohwee
I do me, she feel me comin' like new teeth(ow!)
I got paper like loose leaf
Come over here and maybe you can get a few sheets
My body's unique like the Sistene chapel
Fresh, six green apples
I should cut myself to see, if my blood's red
Baby I brainstorm, call me Floodhead
Married to the money, and if she leaves me bury me money
And when you're not good then ya arrogance is funny
And when you're really rich, then asparagus is yummy
Weezy F. Baby
