(Ja Rule - talking)
Ja Rule, Chuck B-more
Every thug needs a lady
And every thug needs a down ass bitch, huh, feel me
Every thug needs a lady
Baby I'm convinced, you my down ass bitch

(Chorus - Ja Rule)
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd lie for me, like you lovin me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd die for me, like you cry for me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd kill for me, like you comfort me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
Girl I'm convinced, you're my down ass bitch
(Ja Rule)
Uh
I know that you're lovin me, cause you thug with me, who bust slugs for me?
My baby
Who gon' kill for you, like I comfort you, who else but the Rule?
You feel me
Girl when we connect the dots we hit the spot
Twin Benz's, you ride hard, I ride drop
And to make it better, baby got the nina' Beretta tucked low
And I'm two cars back with the four-four
And it freaks you out, on your momma's couch, that's what us thugs be 'bout
You know me
And when I pray for love, baby pray for us, who celebrates the thugs?
My lady
Got me seekin capital game when I spit sixteen
Whether bars or sixteens in the doors of cars
A star is born
In the hood, made a name live on, R-U-L-E, ladies, feel me

(Chorus)

(Charli Baltimore)
Now I'm show you blood or love, there's no belly you bounce from
Blow sellin, dough amounts to no tellin
There'll be no tellin, snitches get it back
Those gats to your backs for my boy
What part of the game is that, huh?
Niggas and they feelings cause I handle your dealings, keep your name in tact
My fame's in tact so cops won't know what it's hittin for
Now hoes wanna know what you shittin for
Cause I'm your bitch, the Bonnie to your Clyde
It's mental, mash your enemies, we out in the rental
I'm your bitch, niggas run up on ya, shift ya lungs, who's your organ donor?
What they know about, extreme meausures I'm a ride with you
And my baby three-eighty at my side
And we lock the town, I'm as down as any thug
My love, they gotta take us in blood, what

(Chorus)

(Ja Rule)
You could die from love, at any given time I could die from slugs
But that's what this life is capable of
The death and the life of a bitch and a thug, is what I'm scared of
But got a woman that ain't afraid to, tuck the toast in the Escalade
Pop on niggas that showin me shade, but only for the Rule cause that's my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don't care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c'mon, follow me, and bust back at police, conceal ya heat
It's a bit much to blaze up
Rule and Chuck and I.G., the Murderers, I-N-C
With one on the hip, one in the holster, nigga will toast ya quick
Especially a down ass bitch

(Chorus)

(Ja Rule)
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, ladies
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, baby
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, ladies
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, baby

Shit, who gon' love you like that?
Thug with you with it stacked to the ceiling or splittin a dub with you

Until that bloodshed, blood red, or we O.D
Remember every word that you told me?

Rip her one time, in two minutes she'll call back

Verse One: Lil' Cease

There's only noe Lil' Ceaser
Who can touch ya who tease ya
Cruise around the world, tease her with my Visa
Now you're askin' me, the questions and lies
I'll tell ya neither, but betta be a believer
Ceaser Leo believe ya
Iced out, me and Kim rockin' at the White House
See if you can handle this pressure with the lights out
I'm catchin' flights out, D-rockin' plus I'm trifed out
Brooklyn Mint hats and sweatas, with the nights out
Did that, it's all about the break like the Kit Kat
That kid got, players from Brooklyn that get chicks black
I meant that, you like the way Ceaser Leo spit that
It's a trip that, you niggas had to kill B.I.G. to get back
But I sit back and hope that crack
See I don't smoke that, it's too many black folks
With street dreams wanna blow back
Cease aloupe that, I rock a show and hope you know that
And rock a party, and rock a body
Just to help my dough stack

Chorus

You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'
You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'

Verse Two: Camron

Uhh, I dare you and the men tryers
Mersadies Benz buyers, chromed rhime tires
O-D like limp buyers, gun sticky handles
Tricky bandels, shit we ran through
And I'ma drink until I catch a plate of Mickey Mantle
With the Land through, then I'm storm out with my coins out
Crispy Sandels, don't like it, well damn you
Ya know how Cam do, mess around and slam you
All about respect now, check ya on black nail
Then we bring the text down, head trek now
Last year I closed the  Rec down
With me and the click, I bring the slicks Nicks
Peepin' the chips, uhh get open off the factory dips
And he sportin' on the back of the whip
That cat Un, like the Acelney whip
Stack chips, twin match on his tip
And it's Undertainment, formely Undeas
We all gon' squeezers, problem, come see us

Chorus

You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'
You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'

Verse Three: Charli Baltimore

Yo, it's my family, keeps me runnin' like car fluid
Call me bitch, put the "R" to it
Take the "TC" from it, see we done it
Birds hummin', we heard dem
Comenses, stay Emmy, so I made it from it
Fool never heard of them, I'm Charli, ya Harely
Half of any chick that I ball wit', spoil wit'
I rock brand new, as my whole click and quite well
Ya sell stills Bell A-T-L, we might grow tell
Have vicious on ya Miyell, but play these skills right
Got to give me credit like Mase T's, and face-ti
Last Dons, comense status, only trees we smoke B-Palms
And S-Classes, burn rubber in a 420
Abosrb money, the glamerous fam
Rock Versace like my man and watch me
CB rap Debouitont, any flow you want
I'll arrange it, rocks style, change it
Any time, keep in mind
Charli Baltimore for Undertainment, we're the famous

Chorus

You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'
You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'[Intro]

Get sniped forreal, Cypress Hill how I kill a man (damn)

The death and the life of a bitch and a thug, is what I'm scared of
But got a woman that ain't afraid to, tuck the toast in the Escalade
Pop on niggas that showin me shade, but only for the Rule cause that's my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don't care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c'mon, follow me, and bust back at police, conceal ya heat
It's a bit much to blaze up
Rule and Chuck and I.G., the Murderers, I-N-C
With one on the hip, one in the holster, nigga will toast ya quick
Especially a down ass bitch

(Chorus)

(Ja Rule)
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, ladies
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, baby
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, ladies
Thug on, cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, baby

(Chorus) 2x

Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)Intro: Silkk (Cam'Ron)

Remix
(That's right) Silkk the Shocker
Uh, Cam'Ron (You ain't know) No Limit
(That's right) Untertainment
(I'm here and there) mo' money
(I'm here and there)
Ya don't know?

[Verse One: Cam'Ron]
Aye yo I just walk wit' ya'll, I don't wanna rhyme
I just need talk wit' ya'll
Mamacita, senortia
I'm lookin' for my wifey
Cats always love me, till they girls start to like me
They don't know I'm sheisty, and all my jewels Icey
Tryin' to settle down Ma, stop actin' all fiesty
Cause 'I don't wanna be a playa no more'
Know it's soft, but I cam with a 'core
For the love of Money, Charli, whoa It Ain't My Fault
Like Silkk, it's so timid, my trunk, it go wit' it
The whole Squad is Terrorin', cats is No Limit
And I'm a diplomat, I'm a diplomat
Where my honies at?, where my money at?
That's why we act like that
Clak clak clak!, pat pat pat!
So all you girls bring your thongs and shit
Don't front, cause you know what song this is
Ju don't know

[Hook: Wyclef]
Ya don't know what we're going through
Ya don't know the things that Cam is showing you
What we're about to do
You don't know
Ya don't know what we're going through
Ya don't know the things these thugs will do to you
You and your family through
Ya don't know

[Verse Two: Big Punisher]
Yo, yo
All the mami's know me, the Spanish kid wit' the goatee
If this was L.A., I'd be a motherfuckin O.G
Ya my taste, thick in the waist, pretty in the face
Dominican race, like my twin Triple Seis
Hot as hell, I'm trickin' in
Shorties sharp as nails, the official chick
Reppin Uptown to Harlem World, where we at
I'm up coughin in the ambulance
From way downtown, they got the Horses and the Carriages
For 40 bucks, you can ride and get ya hug on
Another 20, puff lye and get ya crush on
It's all love, just like the Bud' when ya hit it
Cause way downtown, you know the fuzz is tryin' to hear it
So when ya spark, ya make sure it's in the dark
And most importantly, stay away from Central Park
Cause cops live, just to put away a thug
But not today, cause me and my baby in the Cabaret of Love

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Charli Baltimore]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo, uhh
I thought I already barked on cats about Westhaven
It ain't work, gotta Scream on cats like Wes Craven
Owwwww!, they ain't know I hadn't in me
Like lil' dicks, didn't know they had it in me
Don't you know don't you know, we pull up from a show
Cam and chrome bag the hoes, I Prada bags all the dough
And caked out, break out, uh
Horse & Carriage, forced to marriage, been had too many carats
And they ain't know, passin' that down
Where I come from
Ask Jane, that's my dun-dun
How we handle them dumb dumb's
And we like, Siskel and Elbert
We review cats, thumbs up if they they shit's right
And down if they new jack's
You might see Charli, in a Benz or Ferrari
Hennesey or Pacardi, gettin' bent at a party
But I flip, be the new face, cover of Trace
This the motherfuckin remix, we ain't need no {Mase}

Uh huh uh huh
We like it (Slikk the Shocker)
Uh huh uh huh (Cam'Ron, No Limit)
(Untertainment)
(Mo' money, ya heard me)

[Verse Four: Silkk the Shocker]
I live life like a thug, cause time's is rough
Convicted felon; now I like, rhyme for bucks
Ball till I fall, should I say, my time is up
And I cop you diamonds, never diamond cut
Forget the money, cause I could ball with or without the shipment
And I'm down girl, but I could ball with or without the chick
Sillk the Shocker, Cam'Ron, now how you gonna doubt us a hit
(Must be a car), Miss I could pull you, with or without the six
Now I ain't the C-E-O, but I ain't far from it
So if I ain't far from C-E-O
That mean I ain't far from havin' C-E-O money
Can't discuss what I'm worth, but I'm worth this much
Like Mantigo, fall back like snatchin' purses for bust
So many styles - drop a beat, I'mma drop a hit
Rap game stop for the dope game - and cop a brick
No Limit Soldier baby, so watch the talk
Get lost like ohhhhhhh, "It Ain't My Fault!"
I'm from the N-O, L-I, M-I to the T
Tru my click, Silkk, the Shocker, yeah that's me
Now look, money I'm tryin' to make it
Bustas I'm tryin' to break, girls is like
Ooh I love Silkk, and then, ooh I hate him!
Cause they can't have me, but I don't look
I can't afford to live average
So senorita, let me walk you to my carriage
Now I don't wanna settle down, but we can do it like we married
Cheese!

Birds gotta feed 'em bread, so he can eat her head
I'm almost 21, but I still pee in the bed
Had to flead the FED's, all be trife
And I got a crush on Edith (who, Archie's wife!)
Yo not monagomy, pornograhy
On the outside, like an apostrophe
Tell my girls, I really like photography
Snap shots naked, the wildest boss
First night, head whop, and our salads tossed
While you in a mean neon, I'm with Celine Dion
Throw her in the bed, she the next one I pee on

You know we throw away, blunts for my niggas that's dead
Pour a Law Liqour, drink a long ligga
Then again I never beat, for my nigga Digga
You know I got, navigators, so we won't get lost
N-O-R-E, these Queens niggas call me the Force
At the arraignment, Thugged Out
Undertainment, for the lawyer - fuck 'em and the judge saves it
And I - did every crime - nigga name it

[Charli Baltimore]
Fools ain't ever know, the ghetto's be the baddest click
Charli's Angels, tangle with Devil's - Advocate
Hoes mad cause our pussy's got the fattest clits
It's some status shit, how we gon' have a bitch
Under pressure, the Un undress her
That's a tester, that's just the best flirt, to the best skirt
Ever make it to networks
Like N.B.C., N.O.R.E., B'More and Cam'Ron
Anything we put our hands on, soak up like a tampon, plan on
For puttin' out the hottest LP's
Since - shiiit yo, you gon' have to tell me
Cause this is hip hop, meneaja twat
And ya'll jealous cause what I'm fuckin' wit' the two hottest
Underground fellas, what!

Chorus (Noreaga, Baltimore, Cam'Ron)

Aiyyo Iraq, Harlem World, Philly, San Juan

[Cam'Ron]
Yo, all on the ballers shit

Head is what we all could get, biggest to the smallest dick
She gon' swallow all of it
Harlem gon' have a ball with that
After I get her pregnant, yo we goin' to the mall with it

[Noreaga]
Yeah nigga, you know the lie, fuck that bitch
The only reason I don't kiss her, is cause she sucked his dick
And I don't even trust, ourself bro, fuck dat ho
Pussy stinkin' anyway, let her go

[Charli Baltimore]
Yo ya'll niggas stay fuckin' with them grimmy chicks
On the real though, I wonder where ya'll find these chicks
The rest is evident, I'm the type to split on niggas
But if they right, I'll fuck around and spit on niggas
And if they into that hot shit, I might let 'em hit my spot quick
But first they gotta pop shit
If not then they gettin' drop kicked
And I like 'em all, Black Jack ya'll
Near 21, all others gettin' cut cut
So be it, you see me!

Chorus (Noreaga, Baltimore, Cam'Ron)

Yo, yo
Charli Baltimore
Suave House, what (pimp da one you love)
Yo, Untertainment yeah
From N.Y. to GA
Yeah yeah
This for all my ladies yo
All my ladies that are pimps
Right, cause we can be pimps ladies, we can be pimps
Yo

[Charli]
From the intro, nigga had me hooked like indoe
Shoulda kept my shit tight like homes with no windows
But women knows
Ballers, be sayin' that right shit
On some layin' that pipe-shit
But me, got right quick
Open, still kept my feelings tight-lipped
Trippin', all game was slippin'
Off the hyped bit, always been the tight bitch
Keep these cats in line, pay that rent on time
And we'll talk about extra keys to my spot
When it's extra V's in my lot, extra G's in my knots
So how I managed to get damaged on 'chill with one nigga' shit
I was to break me off with some more figures bitch
I don't know, just caught me at the right moment
Vulnerable, nigga jumped up on it
With mind games, took me out of my frame
I ain't even want his payback, my homey Tony Drapper
He pimped for the guts and I was givin' 'em up
Can't tell me I can't have any player I want
And I burnt myself out tryin' to turn his ass out
All he wanted was a fling and no strings
Slayin' me, on some less weighin' fee
One-half of his shit
But when it blew up, I said fuck this rappin' shit
Been sheisty all my life, and it came back
It happens when your minds attached to your perfect match

[Eightball] (Rodney)
Charli Baltimore put it in they face (pimpin' ain't easy)
Let 'em know that pimpin' ain't easy
Pimp ladies and pimp fellas (pimpin' ain't easy)
Gotta get the dough, no time for the jealous

Charli Baltimore put it in they face (pimpin' ain't easy)
Let 'em know baby, pimpin' ain't easy
Pimp ladies and pimp fellas (pimpin' ain't easy)
Gotta get the dough, yeah
Pimp da one you love

[Charli]
Yo, so what now?, after all this time has past
Just to find out, all along, it was just a gas
I asked my best friend, my dog for advice that got me
And I was twisted, haters got me
Yeah, no doubt, it's a nigga and shit
He was trippin' off the way I was OP off the trick
He said, "Yo, you can scoop any nigga you wish"
Just seperate the dick from your mind and shit
Make that punk recognize how your time was spent
How your time was lent, not how your mind was bent
Get yourself back from that cat
And rise above, only way to pimp
Is to pimp the one you love
Wise words, my dog got me trained right
Game tight, had to stay strong and to stay tight
Stay nights, with my doggie
Knew he had my back till the day I made eye contact
With my old boo, best friends, remember what I told you
Pimpin' ain't easy, gotta play sleazy
Went to his house, put it on him and bounced
Fucked him with my eyes open, got him groppin'
Tables turned, nigga stressed, nigga guessed
He could play a player
But I got schooled and fooled him
Ladies let me tell you how you get it and win
First shit on him and then say forget it on him, yeah

[Charli - Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
All these niggas go around talkin' bout they pimps
Ladies' is pimps, knwhatImsayin''?
We know how to get to niggas minds
With the pussy and then get they minds yo
It's a mind thing, you know what I mean?
Niggas runnin' around on some bullshit
Ladies is takin' over
Gettin' these niggas fucked up, yo
I'm tellin' you
The only way a lady can become a pimp
Is to start with that nigga that is always under you, yo
Pimp dat nigga
Make that nigga work for your ass
Yeah, yeah
This is the words of Charli Baltimore, 98 shit

Who bang?, B'More and Wu Tang, new thang
Mad at how we do thangs, RZA copped me two fangs
Official, now I bite through gristle
Gold teeth style in from Philly to Stanton Island
While in the meantime, spit mean lines
Fuck clean rhymes, like mine's grimmy
Like my niggas be
Picture me, coming off soft
Ya'll just cough up shit, I swallow rhymes
Makin' bitches swallow 9's, re-define
This rap shit, make my shit a classic
Like Bethoven, stay posin'
For the camera, stamina
Like a crackhead, and crackheads are amauters
You try me, no in-between like Y to Z
Pick brains like labotomies
Still thoughts to charts of Billboard's
Throw pour ill spores, leave niggsa stiff like still-born's

I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
(What, what, what)

And now I wanna tell ya how to get your thing together

[Ghostface]
I'm like Spider-Man, fifth brother up in the Clan
Drop like crap's that's scattered all up in ya van
Skelly-man crook, character star
In Donald Goines book
MGM, Heaven and Hell, sat with the cook
With the big spice bone, red hairs is killin' me
Knotted up, twisted and green
See them crystals in it?
Rap Yogi Berra
Bear hug and five hundered ounce of that Staision
Wild man, Sarah
Rush after hours, Alpha in the beds
Caked hands like Dai Smith, rap Hagler with a fade
Magilla, Charli Baltimore with Hazel driftin' withdrawels
Wind Face start with the Killah
Stood still, a whole river chill
Looked up, it got dark, that's when RZA started to build

Hey yeah!

Hey yeah!
I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up

Hey you, blow your whistle (whistle sound)

[Charli]
What, what, what, what!

Aye yo, you praise me, turtleneck nigga rockin' Paisley
Shots crazily, steady blazin' where the spades be
Teams like Starsky and Hutch, you put deluxe truck
Ya bankrupt, 52's Knox, I heard you Ku Klux, damn
Tear it out the van, sweat it with a tan
Wicked like Remo spray can, Sugar Duran
Fuck a cocktail, get my balls licked in Hell
Read his Igloo Tales, hell all the dogs with broken tails
Salt range, short order tab
Ironman, bubble bath, nucleus, split the atom in half
Meet dime O's, fifth brother bug inside 8 pole
Change though, crush the birds inside the strip pose

[Charli]
Rap Conspiracy, hold songs for ransom
Lancin' in Ghostmode, coke mixed with Branson
Sheisty, tree's soaked in half-ki's
Sabotage N.Y. with snipe's and 79's
Channel 9's scene street team made news with who's
Charli, every 16 bars be
Sickening, peep the scription
Rhyme vixen
Keep the clips in tact, watch ya back

Cruise around the world, tease her with my Visa
Now you're askin' me, the questions and lies
I'll tell ya neither, but betta be a believer
Ceaser Leo believe ya
Iced out, me and Kim rockin' at the White House
See if you can handle this pressure with the lights out
I'm catchin' flights out, D-rockin' plus I'm trifed out
Brooklyn Mint hats and sweatas, with the nights out
Did that, it's all about the break like the Kit Kat
That kid got, players from Brooklyn that get chicks black
I meant that, you like the way Ceaser Leo spit that
It's a trip that, you niggas had to kill B.I.G. to get back
But I sit back and hope that crack
See I don't smoke that, it's too many black folks
With street dreams wanna blow back
Cease aloupe that, I rock a show and hope you know that
And rock a party, and rock a body
Just to help my dough stack

Chorus

You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'
You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'

Verse Two: Camron

Uhh, I dare you and the men tryers
Mersadies Benz buyers, chromed rhime tires
O-D like limp buyers, gun sticky handles
Tricky bandels, shit we ran through
And I'ma drink until I catch a plate of Mickey Mantle
With the Land through, then I'm storm out with my coins out
Crispy Sandels, don't like it, well damn you
Ya know how Cam do, mess around and slam you
All about respect now, check ya on black nail
Then we bring the text down, head trek now
Last year I closed the  Rec down
With me and the click, I bring the slicks Nicks
Peepin' the chips, uhh get open off the factory dips
And he sportin' on the back of the whip
That cat Un, like the Acelney whip
Stack chips, twin match on his tip
And it's Undertainment, formely Undeas
We all gon' squeezers, problem, come see us

Chorus

You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'
You can put your army against my team and
I guarantee it will be your very last time breathin'

Verse Three: Charli Baltimore

Yo, it's my family, keeps me runnin' like car fluid
Call me bitch, put the "R" to it
Take the "TC" from it, see we done it
Birds hummin', we heard dem
Comenses, stay Emmy, so I made it from it
Fool never heard of them, I'm Charli, ya Harely
Half of any chick that I ball wit', spoil wit'
I rock brand new, as my whole click and quite well
Ya sell stills Bell A-T-L, we might grow tell
Have vicious on ya Miyell, but play these skills right
Got to give me credit like Mase T's, and face-ti
Last Dons, comense status, only trees we smoke B-Palms
And S-Classes, burn rubber in a 420
Abosrb money, the glamerous fam
Rock Versace like my man and watch me
CB rap Debouitont, any flow you want
I'll arrange it, rocks style, change it
Any time, keep in mind
Charli Baltimore for Undertainment, we're the famous

Chorus

You can put your army against my team and

Roppin' niggas

Put they G's on lock
Stocks in da safe
Wit da keys unlocked
Angels tangle wit theft
On Road Bayo
Muthafuckin' Charles in Charge
Like Scott Bayo
Who got the yayo
Sell it, snort it
Ballas that import it
Cats that extort it
Half ounce cats that work hard for the money
Spend they flip money
While they hunt for this honey
Playboy bunny
Need me some carrots
Went from chickenhead to parrots
So fuck yall
Bird on the arm represent my status
Clit be da fattest
West Coast quick to have this

[Cam'Ron]
How you gonna con Cam
Remember me
Bitch I'm da don man
Hustle wit my mom's man
Ring on hand
Fuck hood rumors
Shit like ice cream bitch
Good Humor
Fuck yall gonna tell me
Me and Skeezie Ace smoke a L, G
Keep it on da LD
And I kill what I'm rhyming on
Everytime you see me bitch
Six hundred diamonds onLadies and gentlemen
I o by the name of Cassidy
Mr. Hip-hop
And I put this song together for my city
Feel me?
Mayhem music, we forming history!

[Chorus]

We from the gutter
Fell with nothing but thugs
A bunch of convicted fellas
That selling nothing but drugs
Feely, pistol banging, city of brotherly slugs
Feely, pistol banging, city of brotherly slugs

Move aside, home invasions, ain't no bitch and no blood
And they high up serum, pills, liquor and drugs
Feely, pistol banging, city of brotherly slugs
Feely, pistol banging, city of brotherly slugs

I'm the nigger that get you stomped with
I drink the liquor, you get starched for being with it
Smoking, hiding in the stars, get!
To impose, I up the dosage in the milligrams
This night for real, Cypress Hill, I'mma kill a man!
Monday still a pain as always
It's always building dirty, shooters in my hallway
The vic is all gray, bombed up and rigged for war
I should of worked more in the bag, it's time to eat some more

Niggers rather have their shit strapped in the lead
Break him off in pieces, leave him like Kit-Kat
Finding where the woes be, rest where the pit's at
Tying his whole head, he'll leave with a chain strapped
Cheaters hate the D, niggers can't hate the G
36, but some niggers don't make it to 6
Now bake up a key, make it to B
They be working with them boys, those niggers safe as a key

Niggers cocky, niggers feeling our swag
Always K40's, killing niggers with Macs
Pretend they wanna bail, niggers flexing with cash
I airyed at your face 'till your face is a match
Dead. What is fuck niggers talking 'bout?
Feeling weed, the hardest, niggers fucking out
Kill beat for murder, we don't talk it out
Homicide laws, feely niggers spark it out

Hey, listen, I'll pop that gap like I'm slightly retarded
It's like my body here, but my upper flight is departed
Think twice, get a coffin, you don't wanna be a target
You just wanna make rap songs, you don't wanna get started
Couple of rats to a shooter, put your heat to a market
Hit your legs with a chopper, now you walk with a walker
Oh, hell, now, feely in the building, you heard of us, we murderers
Gillie Dale, 2 1 5, nigger, that's part of us

I'm a baller, I was born a much man than Chris Steven
They smiff and skid belly, new nigger in town with the birds, strip Kelly
Before we break it down, there's a line in front of the Deli
Before the show's over, a line in front of the tele
Put 'em down, hit 'em up, hit 'em up
Fuck, what these niggers wanna do now?
Run around with a double barrel, one shot, that's two down
Homicide for the life for us, I holds my crew down
Fucking informers, I hate them. We tight, niggers, we shoot down

Years with them fillie cats, we ain't with that silly rats
North-West, South side, you don't need no city map
Yes, entire rat game be ridding piggy-bank
With the deuce, deuce, but this ain't pity-path
Real nigger rather slugging than hugging
You get money? I can't get none with you, then fuck it!
They just part of the struggle, they just part f the hustle
Part of the game. You part of this? cause we start trouble

They say he back on rapper about the drugs he got
But I'm a D boy from the block so fuck it, ride or not
Cooking up is what I do, a baller make a living
On my spare time I'm cooking rats and loading pistols
Try to rob me, niggers tried and they died for it
Ride around with no licence and a line on me
Trapping hard, blowing wild in the meanwhile
The work running on the market, on the speed dial
I'm high on serum, we ride with the sheriff
You call her wife, but the whole hood share her
Big bears, feel it, they don't mean to scare you
My young boys run the city, their area
Heard you was scared to come back home
Nigger call OBH, we the backbone
North fillie, south fillie, keep gats on
Uptown a Frankfurt, my ...

[Chorus]

Put thirties in the system
I can taste the lane when i kissed them
Court refuses to dismiss him
So we might as well cook in the streets and the kitchen
Yeah, cubbling all smashed. 800 in the stash
One point, I'm all in cash, but 80 on the dash
So them lights started to flash
Called the motor off the E-Way
Gun in these tools, pocket full of blues
A law abiding citizen, so, long story short
That nigger made a move, so that nigger made the news

Feely, pistol banging, city of brotherly slugs
Kill your brother, hit the funeral, give your mother a hug
They gave your brother them slugs, they gave his ass a brick
And he ain't bring back the dove
The city of B, city of E's, city of me
City of cash, shout out the roof, shout out to Rye, (what up?)
The city that cuffing hard, the city wear shines
Them niggers don't ever doubt, the nines forever spout
Outlined with chalk, city of Will Smith, city where I'm the king
Gillie, that's real shit
Fuck all the haters, don't feel this
Though it get realest, my niggers is careless

I'm some latter Ville pistol vein ya
You got'cha mind made up, I bet the pistol will change it
The Lone Ranger, I dare one of you niggers to play tanto
And get a feather put in your cat, nigger, pronto
My team lean so you can't lead a purple 'round them
Get them out of town, nigger, I run circles around them[Vocorder]

Verse One

Now everybody wanna know the outcome, of went I come out
My roads to success, pay dues, with the thumb out
Hitch-hike, from she aight, to she's the nicest
I permit chicks to front, now I got a license what
Everybody wanna know if I spit my own hits
Come to any session, any song in question
Drop 48 bars on spots like remixes
All hoes do is add on my words like prefixes
Roll 'Thorough Bitches' from deep South to these sixes
Been way past cats ideas of mad riches
Phone numbers, bank accounts
They gon' match the time, what
9-9-9, 9-9, 9-9
And the punchline, give my best thoughts at "Crunch Time"
I drop cats front, part 2, three much
You want, hot shit, pop shit or some toxic
Underground gossip, '99, I lock shit, what

Fall off, only thing we do is parl' off
If it's beef, only thing you do is call off
Talkin' about Starter, please, we got is sewed up
When we got shows where you're at, don't even show up
Niggas need to grow up, step they flow up
Accept they diamonds won't blow up, and put they dough up

Ain't never been spotted, shit, nigga can throw me
Can't nobody hold me to nothin' they can't show me
Knew half now, and half now, do the math now
See who laughs now, E-mail, not free mail
Get the heffers like E-mail, rhyme with such detail
Geared to my songs like seashells, de-rail

Yo, this song is about four people that I loved and I lost
Try to feel me, yeah
Time flies
Still remember all the good times spent
Trips to the beach, watchin' horror flicks
And even though you and mom wasn't with each other
You all showed each other love like sister and brother
When I was small everyday you picked me up from school
Called you by your first name, you were so cool
You used to tell me everything I know from youth till I grown
So why you waiting to tell me how the problems grown
And you died on your birthday
It was my worst day
Call you dad know wish I did it from my first day
Just like my dog 18 with mad cream
Locked out on the drug scene
Had cats from other teams
Hatin', went from juvy hall to willy
In 6 months time Makaveli and Philli
But its hell when everybody's jailed
Gun shots to your back on Valentines Day
I miss you bell, damn

1 - [missjones]
Didn't we almost have it all?
But love was all we had worth giving
The rise with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you made life worth living

[Charli]
Seventeen when I met you
I never bet you would help me bring a life to the world
And bless it yo
I thought we were destined to have our names tattooed
But I guess your depression got the best of you
Stressing you, things gon' work out
Cause we still friends but you choose to murk
When you had many reasons to stay
Suicide ain't the only way, it's the lonely way
Now everybody just left me with death to except
But I still had you, still had my boo
And we was right there at the height of everything
The height of your career I still wear my ring
And you said you wouldn't leave me like everyone else
One bullet took you instead now I dread
Thinking back to the last day I saw you
Picking up the phone to call you
Damn we had it all too

[missjones]
Didn't we almost have it all?
The nights we had until the morning
You know you'll never love like that again
Didn't we almost have it all?

[Charli]
Everybody can relate to loss
Even just a pet, you never forget
Death is the final say but you find a way
And survive keep your memories alive
Yo everybody can relate to loss
Even just a pet, you never forget
Death is the final say but you find a way
And survive keep your memories alive
Sing it with me

[missjones]
Though we're apart it just seems so far
I know in my heart I'll always love you
Though we're apart it just seems so far
I know in my heart I'll always love you

Repeat 1

2 - [missjones]
Though were apart
It seems so far
(Didn't we almost have it all?)
But I know in my heart
I will always love you
(Didn't we almost have it all?)[Guy] Hey Charli, hey Charli, hey Charli

[Verse 1]
We throw a club in the clique nigga
I need a thug and a drink
Scream "The Inc" Till I'm "Gone" like N'SYNC
Bitches born for the scene
Ass fat like it was born in them jeans
They come on to my team
Now we on to a scheme
Ready for the tape on
Face on
Ass is up never
Glasses up better
Fuck it we brown paper baggin off the wagon
See who worth taggin
I play wit em but no slidin off
Im watchin him expression as I'm ridin off
Play 2-way tag but I'm not for baggin
Who press cats? Me
I was back like Jet Lagan
Your fuckin wit a I.G. associate
Want a dose of it?
Can't come close to it
Keep it brief like our game is been
With more albums I score see who worth more

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I play gats, knives wit em cause I love to chase
22"s on the Lex got em lovin my taste
Love ta pace
Mac doors got em lovin my face
38" on the waste you wastin wit your place
I don't know you better then I don't show you
But who's behind my chicks
Never mind
Never mind we never find one worth the energy
My angels on Hennessey thinking they see enemy
So keep it spinnin like Rule records on radios
Even out the ratio 7 and 1
All chicks from the front and the back
All cliques aw shit we here whenever we near
Sweetheart I ain't tryna swell you let me tell you
If you can bitter or spit me you can hit me
Shit I ain't met one yet
Ain't settlin foot to the pedal and cats keep on yellin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ok
Can go deeper then replies on the beeper
Ill work wit ya but lemme see if I fit ya
Im more complex then dinner and a movie
Nigga you gotta move me
A bitch kinda moody
So what's the plan of action
Get it crakin
What u working wit lets see if I can work wit it
Im no amateur game master
He has ta lay the mack down a little faster bastard
Too slow and I'm dustin em one up
Play the hood till the sun up they run up in
Im skirtin no flirtin
I ain't checkin em niggas still got the plot thickenin (thickenin)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
