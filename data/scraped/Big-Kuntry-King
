[Intro: T.I. & Young Jeezy]
[T.I.]
Crème de la crème, homie, top shelf you know
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back
[Young Jeezy]
Chea, you already know what this shit is nigga, remix nigga
Mannie Fresh, T.I.P what up, nigga? I got'cha nigga
I'ma show these niggas what to do on you, nigga

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I let my chain hang low get that thing up on my waist
All them haters talking reckless tell 'em say it to my face
Concealed bankroll, yeah, I almost caught a case
It's the remix so Mannie Fresh drop the bass
I say now 28 inches got me sitting so high
Reach straight up through the clouds God damn I'm in the sky
Got my 87 zone, goddammit I'm fly
Bet you anything won't nann' nigga try it
I push the Yukon Wednesday, the drop top Monday
Ice cream Impala same color as a sundae
So you can miss me with that hating and that "He can't rap shit"
Tell them faggot-ass niggas wrap their lips around my dick
Goddamn my money's sick, hey, I need to see a doctor
Black on black Bentley call it "Phantom of the Opera"
Lemon lime drop top, I call it a Sprite
When I pull out the garage you can call it at night

[Hook x2: T.I.]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Dro, my trunk gon' break the damn law
I'm riding through the hood with eighths of damn raw
Them 27's tall but them eights are damn raw
Bitches know they see the platinum is gray like grandpa
Spray the Chevy all kind of sour apple colors
Diamonds up in my charm look like pineapple suckers
TEC-9 for some, MAC-90 for others
Lethal weapon on Ducati's, I got on my Danny Glovers
Nah, this ain't the movie, but I shot four brothers
And plus I gotta Chevelle that flop four colors
Cars without the covers, my beat down low
I let my rims sit high, I'm the best thing blowing now

Hook x2

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry]
I got my treble up high and my beat down low
I don't slam no doors, hop in where the roof go
What I need a roof fo', replace it with the sky
Streets be mine with that Georgia on my mind
I ride in the wettest paint, like I'm surfing on a tidal wave
Cocaine whip, yeah, straight out the microwave
Man in the trunk, sound like the man knockin'
Five pass rocking with stacks in my pockets

[Verse 4: B.G.]
I got money in my pocket and my mind on mo'
To hear myself think, I like my beat down low
Cigarello full of 'dro and the chevy two-toned
It's sitting on chromes, that's how I get my roll on
Gotta dip through the hood, you know Gizzle keep it real
I see some hot girls, so I'm a turn it up a lil'
Let them bounce to the music, ba-bounce to the beat
The top down, hop in and ride with a G

Hook x2

[Verse 5: T.I.]
Even though I like my beat down low and my top let back
Chrome feet down low and my impala wet back
Ditch or dash, hit the gas tell them niggas check that
Make them bitches sit back woofers give 'em wet cats
Coming down in a Chevy motor sound like it very tight
It is you can tell I hear the tire yelling er' lane
And the way they ain't kicking I bet you could still hear it
Lord forbid I cut it up, I bet I could let Phil hear it
Okay my money real big, choppers is still here
They catch me with it fuck it I'm doing my lil bid
And my drop top riding with my Glock cocked riding
I'm looking for them niggas where they at stop hiding

[Outro: T.I.]
Now that's a motherfuckin remix nigga[Intro: B.o.B.]
Swag bombs in the sky, here I come
Swag bombs in the sky, it's all over me

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
I was fuckin' her friend, now I'm fuckin' her now
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
If you was my nigga then, then I fuck wit' you now
I fuck wit' you now

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
It's a cold world when the cash rules
When the cash rules, watch for the jack moves
Watch for my squad, got me covered like tattoos
Plus a nigga got cheddar like Kraft Foods
Fuck wit' you, if you a real nigga, then I fuck wit' you
And if you got a problem, we could troubleshoot
Send a text to your nigga, let him try to shoot

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ball-hitter, now I'm right outside the W
Wit' my shooter waitin' on you, hope you got another you
Ain't talkin' shit about what my lil' brother do
Or get your ass hit up in the club wit' a double deuce
Hustle Gang, give a damn what a sucker do
Doors up in the verte Lamb howlin', "Fuck a roof"
Pistol on me even though ain't finna bust it
You could sure use some shit, I give a bitch a thousand bucks

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
I was fuckin' her friend, now I'm fuckin' her now
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
If you was my nigga then, then I fuck wit' you now
I fuck wit' you now

[Verse 3: Spodee]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
She say she got a man, that's one thing
You don't spoke then, givin' a fuckin' about
Look at this this bitch wit' them fat-ass hips
Goddamn, girl, you could put a truck in your mouth
Ho forgot about her nigga after playin' (-), a couple of rounds
She was feelin', touchin' me, first she was suckin' me down

[Verse 4: Yung Booke]
Brah, what's up wit' you?
You know damn well I don't really fuck wit' you
Got the lil' shooter, go to shootin' when he touches you
Fuck around, drop a bell on you
Take the plug, met 'em through
Kickin' (-) shit on my Margiela shoes
Higher than this god, I replace you
And my sister, she'll take you to fuckin' babysit her
Had your (-) money fittin' like a brave nigga

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
I was fuckin' her friend, now I'm fuckin' her now
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
If you was my nigga then, then I fuck wit' you now
I fuck wit' you now

[Verse 5: Shad da God]
Margiela my mason and I need investigation
I don't fuck wit' twelve, though I'm bein' (-) racist
Diamonds in her white, don't hold the ticket in her (-)
'Fore they put a new owner permanent vacation
I don't fuck wit' you, who the fuck wished I would stop (-)
We got haters, cuh, we got our own President
She write her sweets on a drug, fuck your numbers

[Verse 6: Big Kuntry King]
I ain't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
You a snitchin'-ass nigga, I ain't fuck wit' you never
Say that's your bitch, I fuck the ho whenever
I knew all my friends ten years, (-)
Came up sellin' crack, bustin' that chopper
Pockets on double cheese, that's a damn Whopper
First thing, nigga, I don't fuck wit' no copper
Catch you boomin' in my trap, man, a nigga gonna drop

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Mac Boney]

Walk up on your victim and squirt somethin' (squirt somethin')
Think I ain't got nuts to pull the trigger? You done lost your mind
I walk up on you killa cocked can then release my 9
I'm tired of niggas thinkin' cuz I rap I'm not the same person
I'll run up on you quick and bust yo shit, live, right in person
Think about these verses before you approach me with that misbehavin'
Cuz I got sawed-off chop your 40 cal I got different flavors
Center squad and Goon shoot up the room ain't no wakin' neighbors
All my soldiers got revolvers, silence'em with baked potatoes
Fuck a hata, hit your ass with hollows till your body
Fall the impact of my 40 threw your skeleton into the wall
I love action, bust a nigga with pistols and assault rifles
My murder game is equal to the motherfuckin' speed of lightning
Young viking, hit a pussy nigga like I'm Mike Tyson
So excitin', 4th of July fireworks when I start lightin'

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: A.K.]
It'll be a nationwide man hunt, why you piss my niggas off
Why you piss my niggas off?  Got to make you take a loss
You talkin' but you ain't sayin nuttin' it's obvious that you fake and flawed
Read'em like a book I'm about to rip his pages off
Do it then, say you tough, do it then, you's a bluff
Called it like I seen it you's a busta nigga, do it then
Never lose my cool, wile out dude, and lose your limbs
The weapon you choose to use, you're note gonna know what you gon' do it then
You better slow ya roll slow ya roll slow ya roll
Zone 1 Zone 4 drag his ass through the floor
I ain't trippin' (I ain't trippin')
I ain't trippin' (I ain't trippin')
I'm a grown man, bitch
I handle my business (I handle my business.)
Campaignin', champagne rainin' need a blunt I got the purp
I don't need a chump up in my face unless you wanna be hurt
Get a grill (get a grill) get a grill (get a grill)
Before I do I let it hit you off the real (off the real)

[Hook]

[Verse 4 T.I.]
Hey here's a couple reasons why dissin' TIP ain't the thang to do
1. I ain't as lame as you, 2. I done slung more 'caine than you
Three, I'm more of a G than all the niggas who hang wit you
Four, When I show up your ho act like she never came wit you
Drama I'm no stranger to
All the niggas you brang wit you
Lay out in the streets their body leakin' till the change to blue
I'mma be the reason your mommy and daddy ashamed of you
And why your cousins, brothers, and sisters don't even claim to you
Pimp Squad Click punk bitch wanna plainer view?
I'mma point this thang at you seconds before I bang at you
Power and respect the money and fame's attainable
We don't mix cuz G's and tricks ain't interchangeable
I'mma bang it when my chamber full, long as it's a thang to pull
Old ladies cryin' kids yellin' niggas sayin' uggghhh
I play the game without a rule or a ref
I'm hands on so when it's on I do it myself. (nigga)

Prolly thought I'd never make it that's what they get fo' thinkin'
While they fakin' it I'm sayin' it, something for the soft
Butta chop pretty face and her ass very soft

And I'm takin' off while all ya niggas fallin' off
You used to be the shit but when that ever counted dawg

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry King]
I'm the voice of the street when I speak niggas listen
You can talk street shit but pimpin' never in it
You don't know about the courtrooms or another hearin'
Snitches ain't snitchin' cause they life they be fearin'
Through the lyrics you can hear it, I spit it how I live it
Gettin' to the money by the bundle how I spend it
All my cars tinted but they know whose in it
Same cool dude on the mic givin' you the bidness
The race ain't over but half you niggas finished
While I'm goin' to the Grammy's tryna see where I'm sittin'
Kuntry King in the buildin', I was just lettin' ya know

Kickin flav my shit major they hate on ?
I'm getting paid now I'm kickin flav
Getting paid now I'm kickin flav

[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
When I'm kickin flav I'm kicking pimpin'
Just know I'm all bout all bitches

Rawer than any coke in the kitchen
Catch me in a foreign whip driving with precision
Can't make no money here unless you get permission
Hold the ? got that memo
Don't get smoked like my Endo
Only jerking work with my ?
No snitchin' no no valid info
Yeah this the Bread Box Cartel
I'm not talking LL when I rock the bells
Pussy niggas actin' hard just that they actin'
When the Chopper get the Rat-A-Tat-in'
Thats when niggas get to rattin'
Thats why I be like get off out my face
You know I rap the P$C nigga all day

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
My top down they raise up
Campaign so major, all about that paper
'cuz that broke shit just ain't us
Ain't got shit on my crew nigga
Twice the shit that these new nigga
Fuck we care about you nigga
For fun we used to go shoot nigga
So you got a lil' gun say you wanna ball
Soon as i got a lil' money say I want it all
Now the multimillionaire racked up
You need a couple deal to check catch up
Now every time you catch us we on point no cactus
We don't act tough we the hustle gang
Getting dough like no other gang

No time to play with these suckers man
Lame nigga pop shit think a nigga famous
But we just gettin' paid ? money kickin flav

[Hook: T.I.][Hook]
"One, is the loneliest number that you'll ever do" [4x]

[B.o.B]
Tell me, who don't wanna be at the top of this?
The top of the game, that's obvious
I'm like Superman in Metropolis
But you can't see me through binoculars
As I fly high over the populace
Tryin to find where the hell my childhood is
I cain't even see it with my irises
The only thing that I see is the irony
Think about the past and the life I lived
All of the days and the nights I spent
In the bottomless pit called poverty
Locked in a room, don't bother me!
So if you plan on stoppin me
You need more than your vitamins
The rap game ain't a lottery
Go to school, get a scholarship
Cause you still gotta deal with the politics
How you gon' not deal with it?
That's like goin up inside of a brothel
And comin out remainin monogamous
It just don't make a lot of sense
So I just stay positive
And if you ain't where you tryin to get
Then it's a prison of the mind you in

[Hook]

[Big Kuntry]
You know who this is, mayyyyne
Big Kuntry Kainnng
Only one it's only me, who gives a fuck 'bout 2 and 3?
You suckers been played out, like them damn Ferrari jeeps
I see you niggas on the creep but y'all never next to me
Cain't see you rock climbers when I'm on my mountain peak
Why peep? Open yo' eyes - you see the cherry Mase' right?
You see the streets, rollin with me, cause my notary certified
You a hundred deep, but they be respectin me when it's only I
Green pie, back it up, tell Matty pass the mic
Know what I'm sayin I'm nasty right, my lyrics got me creamin dykes
I'm by myself when takin flight, and fuckin them girls that keep it tight
Redbox, is the movement, Tim, where's they (Home Improvement)?
While you rappers keep on tryin, I'm #1 already proven

[Hook]

[Mac Boney]
What is the numero uno?
I dip and I slide in my two-do'
Deez niggas be watchin while bitches be jockin
But Boney jack keep it so cool doe
I'm seein 'em checkin my moves out
Be careful while keepin my tool down
They know that I'm reppin that A-Town
So why do these fuck niggas play 'round?
I guess you can hate now - we straight
We got cake, we got bread, we got made clown
While you broke niggas stayed down
I stayed up on my game and my business I'm paid now
I'm never gon' lay down
We (Grand) and we (Royal) y'all niggas just stand down
For yo' homey be man down, we done ran down
Tyler bent on his ass now
I'm the head of my class now
So I'm never gon' bet for these boys that stick hands out
I prefer to keep hands down
So I know who you are when I'm throwin my fans out
Why swing on my Denzel?
I've been ridin and swervin these niggas since oh-fo'
But in one-oh, I drop one mo'
So these niggas'll know I'm the one ho!

[Hook][Intro: T.I. & Young Jeezy]
[T.I.]
Crème de la crème, homie, top shelf you know
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back
[Young Jeezy]
Chea, you already know what this shit is nigga, remix nigga
Mannie Fresh, T.I.P what up, nigga? I got'cha nigga
I'ma show these niggas what to do on you, nigga

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I let my chain hang low get that thing up on my waist
All them haters talking reckless tell 'em say it to my face
Concealed bankroll, yeah, I almost caught a case
It's the remix so Mannie Fresh drop the bass
I say now 28 inches got me sitting so high
Reach straight up through the clouds God damn I'm in the sky
Got my 87 zone, goddammit I'm fly
Bet you anything won't nann' nigga try it
I push the Yukon Wednesday, the drop top Monday
Ice cream Impala same color as a sundae
So you can miss me with that hating and that "He can't rap shit"
Tell them faggot-ass niggas wrap their lips around my dick
Goddamn my money's sick, hey, I need to see a doctor
Black on black Bentley call it "Phantom of the Opera"
Lemon lime drop top, I call it a Sprite
When I pull out the garage you can call it at night

[Hook x2: T.I.]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Dro, my trunk gon' break the damn law
I'm riding through the hood with eighths of damn raw
Them 27's tall but them eights are damn raw
Bitches know they see the platinum is gray like grandpa
Spray the Chevy all kind of sour apple colors
Diamonds up in my charm look like pineapple suckers
TEC-9 for some, MAC-90 for others
Lethal weapon on Ducati's, I got on my Danny Glovers
Nah, this ain't the movie, but I shot four brothers
And plus I gotta Chevelle that flop four colors
Cars without the covers, my beat down low
I let my rims sit high, I'm the best thing blowing now

Hook x2

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry]
I got my treble up high and my beat down low
I don't slam no doors, hop in where the roof go
What I need a roof fo', replace it with the sky
Streets be mine with that Georgia on my mind
I ride in the wettest paint, like I'm surfing on a tidal wave
Cocaine whip, yeah, straight out the microwave
Man in the trunk, sound like the man knockin'
Five pass rocking with stacks in my pockets

[Verse 4: B.G.]
I got money in my pocket and my mind on mo'
To hear myself think, I like my beat down low
Cigarello full of 'dro and the chevy two-toned
It's sitting on chromes, that's how I get my roll on
Gotta dip through the hood, you know Gizzle keep it real
I see some hot girls, so I'm a turn it up a lil'
Let them bounce to the music, ba-bounce to the beat
The top down, hop in and ride with a G

Hook x2

[Verse 5: T.I.]
Even though I like my beat down low and my top let back
Chrome feet down low and my impala wet back
Ditch or dash, hit the gas tell them niggas check that
Make them bitches sit back woofers give 'em wet cats
Coming down in a Chevy motor sound like it very tight
It is you can tell I hear the tire yelling er' lane
And the way they ain't kicking I bet you could still hear it
Lord forbid I cut it up, I bet I could let Phil hear it
Okay my money real big, choppers is still here
They catch me with it fuck it I'm doing my lil bid
And my drop top riding with my Glock cocked riding
I'm looking for them niggas where they at stop hiding

[Outro: T.I.]
Now that's a motherfuckin remix nigga[Intro]
It's got to be grand, nigga, it's got to be the hustle, nigga
It's got to be the muscle, nigga
Who else they gonna goddamn call to talk this shit, nigga?
You already know who run them goddamn bricks down
Fo' real nigga, all that flexin' ain't 'bout nothin', nigga
This Mac Boney, nigga, cocaine champion, nigga
Ya already know

[Hook x3]
I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready

[Verse 1 - Mac Boney]
Get your pots out, I got some new dope for ya
They say the rap game dead, I got some hope for ya
Who said the work slow? I'll bring the boat for ya
A big ass rifle, two of your partners gotta tote for ya
Stay on this live shit, the worm that the bird chase
Slide through the hole, call me clean get away
I'm real and it shows, nigga, ain't anotha way
But sell these 30 o's, I'll die another day
My bitch stay on them toes, she send the bullets right away
I feel it my soul, and I ain't sold a block today
I keep a bank roll, so I ain't gotta make a play
I take it to them hoes and let them niggas see my face
This is how it goes, this is pure this is oil based
This is what you owe, give me meat, keep the business straight
I ball a ounce, 10 grams I demonstrate
Take ya pound money, why you think they call me gutta, nig?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Kuntry King]
Cocaine bought a nigga everything
That's why you can find me ridin' heavy, mayne
Choppa half down, put it in the microwave
Let my bitch do it, she'll hard a nigga right away
Million dollar trap house, trap star, that be me
I control the streets, I could show you how to tame the beasts
And beat up the block like an 808 in the beat
I'm the heart and the soul when it comes to movin' D
Treat it like some pussy when you run it through 100 ki's
Everything is digital, no mo' triple Beams
Class of '96, dope boys yeah, that's evidence
Up for the battery acid, just to drain the evidence
Just in case a rookie cop run up in my residence
I'll tell the young prick go and stick yo hand in it
Naked hoes, Glocks, AK's, and a ski mask
It's Kuntry Kane, bottom line I'm out to get that cash

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - ]
I'm in the all white caravan, similar to the postal man
The Eagle on the side, except my Eagle in my lap man
I'm on the slab with all the plans of takin' over foreign lands
With plenty crack and plenty straps, how it feels to be the man
I cooked it up and put it down, served the heart to hook the town
Now everybody callin' me cause I supply the hardest rounds
So shop with me or I'll lay ya down, I want it all cause I'm a hound
Break me off or take a loss or find your ass in lost and found
Praise a chop, raise a chop, I love breakin' down the dope
Put it in a bad make it look more than you paid for
Finally came up, rich drugs, big plugs
Spit hollow tip slugs and the trigger fit snug
Buy from me or kick ducks cause the dope gonna sell it self
And I, good enough to play hard and invest the rest
Powder white, double S, yes, with the dual set
AC gonna make the game look like no sweat

And you was telling your folks, you were going to murder me
Kept me going to the car, ready hurry to play
Y'all looking at a man, I'm looking at children
Bored like a motherfucker, what is you doing
New Orleans, my city long been burnt
Watch yourself, your coming down your turn

I'm tired of niggas thinkin' cuz I rap I'm not the same person
I'll run up on you quick and bust yo shit, live, right in person
Think about these verses before you approach me with that misbehavin'
Cuz I got sawed-off chop your 40 cal I got different flavors
Center squad and Goon shoot up the room ain't no wakin' neighbors
All my soldiers got revolvers, silence'em with baked potatoes
Fuck a hata, hit your ass with hollows till your body
Fall the impact of my 40 threw your skeleton into the wall
I love action, bust a nigga with pistols and assault rifles
My murder game is equal to the motherfuckin' speed of lightning
Young viking, hit a pussy nigga like I'm Mike Tyson
So excitin', 4th of July fireworks when I start lightin'

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: A.K.]
It'll be a nationwide man hunt, why you piss my niggas off
Why you piss my niggas off?  Got to make you take a loss
You talkin' but you ain't sayin nuttin' it's obvious that you fake and flawed
Read'em like a book I'm about to rip his pages off
Do it then, say you tough, do it then, you's a bluff
Called it like I seen it you's a busta nigga, do it then
Never lose my cool, wile out dude, and lose your limbs
The weapon you choose to use, you're note gonna know what you gon' do it then
You better slow ya roll slow ya roll slow ya roll
Zone 1 Zone 4 drag his ass through the floor
I ain't trippin' (I ain't trippin')
I ain't trippin' (I ain't trippin')
I'm a grown man, bitch

Campaignin', champagne rainin' need a blunt I got the purp

Get a grill (get a grill) get a grill (get a grill)
Before I do I let it hit you off the real (off the real)

[Hook]

[Verse 4 T.I.]
Hey here's a couple reasons why dissin' TIP ain't the thang to do
1. I ain't as lame as you, 2. I done slung more 'caine than you
Three, I'm more of a G than all the niggas who hang wit you
Four, When I show up your ho act like she never came wit you
Drama I'm no stranger to
All the niggas you brang wit you
Lay out in the streets their body leakin' till the change to blue
I'mma be the reason your mommy and daddy ashamed of you
And why your cousins, brothers, and sisters don't even claim to you
Pimp Squad Click punk bitch wanna plainer view?
I'mma point this thang at you seconds before I bang at you
Power and respect the money and fame's attainable
We don't mix cuz G's and tricks ain't interchangeable
I'mma bang it when my chamber full, long as it's a thang to pull
Old ladies cryin' kids yellin' niggas sayin' uggghhh
I play the game without a rule or a ref
I'm hands on so when it's on I do it myself. (nigga)

[Hook x2][Intro: T.I. & Big Kuntry King]

That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
If you don't want no trouble better get back from me
I was trained as a youngin' go and get that money
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah that's right, that's right, that's right, got that right

[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
I'm on the cover of a magazine, ain't even got a album out
Mob at the streets my delete call my hits out
Now i'm the one everybody wanna talk about
Hustle hard, ball harder, that's what I be's about
Trap it out pimpin' better never leave yo white around
I'm the type of nigga break the whole state Alaska down
Now since I'm rappin' all these rappers wanna come around
They stick they hand out but them suckas get no pound
All of a sudden they into me, (huh) they some groupies G
They used to look at the chain and ask me where is T.I.P.,
Now they realize that Kuntry King the man in the streets
It's real mayne cocaine, yeah they finally get it G

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
I got Oprah from the 80s wrapped up in rubber bands
Party like a rockstar, but this ain't a rock band
Throwin' money in the club changing up precipitation
If you gettin' rained on then you ain't participatin'
I bet that struck a nerve yes that's why them niggas hatin'
Prolly thought I'd never make it that's what they get fo' thinkin'
While they fakin' it I'm sayin' it, something for the soft
Butta chop pretty face and her ass very soft
Bet twats and lips make a nigga wanna tear her head off
Bet you wanna switch places like the movie face off
And I'm takin' off while all ya niggas fallin' off
You used to be the shit but when that ever counted dawg

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry King]
I'm the voice of the street when I speak niggas listen
You can talk street shit but pimpin' never in it
You don't know about the courtrooms or another hearin'
Snitches ain't snitchin' cause they life they be fearin'
Through the lyrics you can hear it, I spit it how I live it
Gettin' to the money by the bundle how I spend it
All my cars tinted but they know whose in it
Same cool dude on the mic givin' you the bidness
The race ain't over but half you niggas finished
While I'm goin' to the Grammy's tryna see where I'm sittin'
Kuntry King in the buildin', I was just lettin' ya know
If your the one famous why they ain't let you through the do'
