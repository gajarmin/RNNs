Fast like a nascar nascar nascar nascar (8x)

I'm fast like a Nascar
Ice like a superstar
Up and down the boulevard
I get gouda man
You ain't fast like my 3-point shooter man
21s on 351 cougar man
I get stupid dumb di-d-dumb
Ice king baby and I have plenty fun
I go 18 since I was 18
I got more chains than the nigga from the a-team
Sideshows ghostride the whip
Hey lil momma go on shake them hips
Go on shake them hips, what it do
Ride glasspacks 24's on the shoes

Fast like a nascar nascar nascar nascar (8x)

Eeerr, sidewayz, this way that-a-way
With a gallon of that muthafuckin tanqueray
On my way to get the Cut dawg lifted
Slap these marshall faulks on so I don't hit this bitch
Yeah ho, all in the doe
The money and the dimepiece rims are spinnin whaddi-hittin fo
Winnin don't know how to lose
She choose she tearin it off if she do
Knockin but stock, holdup, I done fucked around and blew a fuse
Circuit breakers, want my mule and 40 acres
I break it, shake it to the curb
That's my word, I'm just crumblin herb

Three bad bitches and they going both ways
Off a couple molly, with a bad body
And that pussey wet like a tsunami

Turn your swag on and baby come and swerve with me

[Hook]

Kafani baby, I'm swagging on 'em
Super cocky and these chicks like to brag on me
Move in sachi with the bag with the tags on 'em
Bad chicks like some like some cap money

Hop on dick the ride it like a harley baby
Hella rappy when im stacking with them bands on her
Stupid booty I'm run it going ham on her

Hey yo my life is like a movie, good role so far
Stick to the script, You can be my co-star
I got a glow ma, should be into solar
Where you get it from Fab? I don't know even know ma
We played Lo Bar on the dance floor nah
V.I.P.s where the dudes gettin dough are
Rap star, trap star, ball player, pro star
Reach for the stars that's the way to go ma
I'm in the cut the one that leave no scars
Dark shades by D I O R
They watchin me they know a fella dope, It's like star gazing with out a telescope
Clean as the rims are, sharper than gem stars, We runnin' on mills like we in a gym ma
The papers thick but now its getting slim ma
Faster than Anna Nicole did on the trim spa
(Keak da sneak)
Fast[Verse 1: Priceless Da Roc]
I like the bad bitches, that's what I'm into
When it comes to getting money, she knows what to do
She asking diddy hela pretty with the whole crew
I let the hammer come nail her yeah she getting screwed
She got a job and her own car
Roll up the bars so she fuck like a pornstar
She vip when she step in
Killing these hoes, she's a close like a weapon
And the pussy good, its the wettest mama
The streets is like a runway and she a primadona
Them red bottoms, all the bad bitches got em
When you spot em, all the real niggas want em
Yeah, I don't do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ones that be glamorous
Do it for the stuck up girls with an attitude who act vicious
So if you're looking for the kid

[Hook]
You can find me with the bad bitches
And I be chillin with the bad bitches
And I don't do it for the ratchets, I do it for the bad bitches
Sippin my dranks, hoodie on me
Sippin my dranks, hoodie on me
And I don't do it for the ratchets, I do it for the bad bitches
You can find me with the bad bitches

[Verse 2: Kafani]
Real from the hood, made her way out
Living off a nigga being played out
You can miss her with that lame ass trick shit
So spend stacks on the make up and lipstick
Red bottoms, you know she got em
The Gucci Louie Prada never been a problem
Flexin on them ratchet ass hoes, in a 9 debetty you can't roll
See I'm on a flow, bad bitch patrol
Nose up, bitches telling thirsty nigga no
Stuntin on them no, running through them stacks like a dope boy
Good job, new porno, no boy
Broke hoes, can't hang, broke niggas get fake numbers fake names
She know the difference from a thrill and a fuck nigga
She don't wanna drink, whole click bottled up nigga

[Hook]
You can find me with the bad bitches
And I be chillin with the bad bitches
And I don't do it for the ratchets, I do it for the bad bitches
Sippin my dranks, hoodie on me

And I don't do it for the ratchets, I do it for the bad bitches
You can find me with the bad bitches

[Verse 3: Beeda Weeda]
Need me a bad bitch, fat ass, long hair, thicker than the average
Ballin like the mavericks, stuntin in the rarri
Baby from the far east, every night she party
Hennesy, Bacardi, sexy call her Barbie
Baby is a dime piece, 20 on the time piece
Get money, shake ass, swag swerve on the day get cash
I'm a boss bitch, love a boss chick
Make hela green cell thick boss thin
Still a trick like base is lofting
Super sexy though, mama is a quarter piece
Never ratchet though, we keep it crackin ho
East all to California, keep it mackin ho
Tennis shoe pimpin, you can call it McEnroe
Sippin on patron counting money cause we '
