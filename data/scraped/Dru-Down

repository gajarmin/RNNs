[Intro]
Haha, the remix - 5 on it!
We creepin' in too, baby
We got 5 on ery'thang mane!
We got Dru Down; we got the Luniz! Shock G, wassup?
Numskull and Yukmouth! Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1

[Verse 1 - Dru Down]
You say you got 5 on my tender, you can bend her over the table
But be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brah? No elementary school-ground playing
Not a 5-dollar bill, but 5-double-zero on the real, feel?
I'm on the level, staying mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high-speed but still don't tap the B.B.'s
I'm D.D., Dru Down, baby

[Numskull]
Like Nyquil, I drop fevers; so either put your 5 up
Or you gots to "Leave It" like "Beaver"
Cause see, a nigga perkin' broke'll smoke your spliff all day
Go home and buy big drinky with his briddy then parlay
I got 5 on the Hennessey, Seagram's, or 40's
Cause "This is How We Do It" like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland City, Frank Nitti is a goner
Num' blowing it up like Oklahoma

[Richie Rich]
Put your feev' with my fin, best believe we'll bend
More corners than you thought till something right is bought
More z-sacks? Believe that: tokin!
Where you from? Oakland! Smokin'
In attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy the whole town loves me
At every event I'm sacked up
So if you need me, scream "Double R!" when you see me

[Hook - Michael Marshall]
I got five on it ("got it good!")
Grab your 4, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Messing with that indo weed!
I got 5 on it; it's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got 5 on it: partna let's go half on a sack!

[Verse 2 - E-40]
"E-40, why you treat me so bad?" 40 makes it happen
Fosgate slappin' and revenue grows
From just a little bit of lightweight flamboastin'
Potent fumes, lingering mighty clouds and Northern Lights
You disrespect Vic da Baron
And you'll be violating my civil rights
I'm starting to feel my scrilla
But perhaps today my scrilla ain't feeling me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools, B
Pockets empty, pitching 5, man I'm dusted
Took off my hat, passed it around, man sprinkle me

[Yukmouth]
Me and E-40 to the head, comin' fed plus, you let the lead bust
Ready to do a murda, mayn; perved off the Hurricane
Slurred again, witness what bein' off two-fifths equal
Me killin' people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane!) "Bring the Pain" like Method
Neglected, smokin kryptonite to the brain for breakfast
Guzzle the Hen-do, finsta do the evil that men do
Give me feev', I shall proceed to continue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shock G]
Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around and heard Yuk' and Num', said I gotta be down
Cause new styles is going down: look around you
Tunes from the Lunz spreading round and round you

[Shock G as Humpty Hump]
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still bringing satin for them drawers
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the cause

[Spice 1]
Rolling up cannabis sativa, hitting the Mary Jane
Smoking the 5 before it's 12 o'clock, sipping on Hurricane
Ready to smoke on the indoe; rolling up my window, finna to go to the land
With a handful of broccoli
When it comes to the sticky I'm the man
Crush nasty, I be hitting the J so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke
T-H-C ain't no joke
I got 5 on ery'thing, let's get loaded and smoke
S-P-I-C-E about to hit it and croak

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, wassup baby?
It's me, your boy with the cape that's always tight
You a little short on some ends?
Don't worry, I'll take care of that, I got 5 on that
I got you[Intro]
Mack playas, ballas, grindas
Yeah I'm the real true pimp of the year
Will ya feel me
Ha ha, pimp of the mutha' fuckin' year

[Verse 1]
Give it up give it up a give it to me
A big mack capitalized Double D, see
And it's on, so I'ma get sick with it
A give me drank and bomb and let me get with it
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year
Goin' around doin' shit like this here
Cause a nigga is strong
And way too long when it comes to my ding dong
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line
So now I know I gotta get mine
It's really no thang to me
See, to be a real true P.I.M.P
Cause I had me a ho or two or mo'
Way back in 80 fuckin' 4
That's when I was a teen
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes
Smackin' hoes, up and down the fuckin' avenues
And ever I do that
I dig a deep in the pocket for the fat gat
Feel me. I'm so goddamn bad
That I had to kick off in a ho's ass
Cause the girl tried to do me
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah, the nigga raped her
But I'm not trippin'
Bitches like you wanna keep on slippin'
So I had to move on
To the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch

[Hook]
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies

[Verse 2]
First thang first on the second verse
I learned a hell of a lot
A get from the get down start
So I had my hoes hoin'
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'
Cause all the game I spit is good shit
And the shit that I spit made me rich
Cause I was all about money
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey
Cause I'm givin' it up quick
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips
Uh, and a bet is better than grey
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney
But I knew she was a fake one
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none
I just walked up to her
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler
And from the get go
I'm just a pimp, ho, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said, "Okay
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today"
Yeeyah, then I said, "Get with it
And don't be a bitch and try to split"
Uh, She was right up under my wing
At the airport at 5:15
She said "Who are you and why are ya here?"
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've got a thang for makin' hoes
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold
And I don't go for talk back
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that
Deduct from the paycheck
Matter of fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac
So I can ride and checkmate
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate
And no I don't play around, fuck around
A when it comes to my money, nigga
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung
I give her Hennessy, a with the one on one
So she can get so high, real high
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy
Cause I'm a kick something just for the hoes
And for myself I keep indo'
And when a ho finds out I'm real, yes I am
Mack playa pimp of the year

[Hook x2][Intro]
Hmmm huh huh...
Woooooo...
Yeyah...
It's Dru Down baby
Yeyah..
Comin straight from that izno...
A.K....
No play...
Matta fact...
Listen to my... baby

[Hook]
Can you feel me?
I said I'm doin' what I gotta do, stayin' true to tha crew
Can you feel me?
I said I'm deep down and dirty, I grew up hella early
Can you feel me?
I said I fantasize about tha dreams, havin' big fancy things
Can you feel me?
I can still remember when I stole my first diamond ring

O.K., I'm deep down and dirty
You heard me before
But I'mma kick this shit
Like I be kickin' in some front doors

Now po-po or 5-0
Straight on that real
Always been real
Fifteen blocks down tha
Street from that feel

But still see
Niggas have got it wrong
That po-po is 5-0
And that is my ho

Come and see me some time
Bust a rim and bust a rhyme
After that I fucked that Remy
Bust a rhyme and get a dime

And lets smoke, choke
Until the break of dusk
Fuck that bitch dawn
And puttin' a penny in my palm

Understand this
I rolls deep in tha five
I've been down with tha five
I gets dirty in tha five

And do a hoo ride. (Why?)
That is tha question
Devils be guessin'
Don't question, stressin'

Livin' in tha ghetto
Hello!
Ya betta hear me
And if ya don't
Ya betta really try to feel me...

[Hook]

Momma always told me
It'd be days like this.
So I took myself to Traders
Bought myself a fo-fifth
And some clips

Shit was gettin' hectic
Check this nigga's try ta wrecka
Veteran etcetera
And I bet ya ya life has never been a taken like, I'm deep down and
Dirty early

But see Pearly
At tha age of three
Took my ass in
Beause my momma was deceased

I still ended up a with tha gangsta
Comin' from tha street
Talkin' mentality, causin' casualties
Don't be mad at me
I'm D.D., pimp playa O.G.,
Born up in tha city of tha O.A.K.L.A.N.D
Ghetto-bound hustla, no sucka, serious about my bussiness
What is this? Now dig this, I overnite became rich
I'm me, not tha ordinary nigga from tha street
Grew up, threw up, to what I wanted to be, and what I sing...

[Hook]

It didn't matta my money was gettin' low, I'm on tha struggle
Whatever a nigga go fo, he gots me on tha double
But solo, cause niggas be bitches and snitches at tha same time
But I'm, a go and get my nine
And find these niggas who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to
These bitches, these bitches who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to these
Niggas who be riggas, but I'm a go and hit and do a diggum smack
And take to yo' ass back to tha future
Smoke super, I'm rollin' in tha six eight Couger
A Ruger, a mastermind like Lex Luger
It ain't no thang, like a chicken wing
With tha (mob/wild?) fo from (ozco?), our mission
Is never impossible. Not fo me see, so fuck that old series, you stuck
On that screen I laugh, I'm over mescaline. Aha ha ha.... I see a
Dream as a triple beam, with hella dough from a mutha fucka, with no
Cut bro...

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeyah...
Can you feel me?
D.D....
Grew up, threw up, to what I wanted to be and what I sing

Can you feel me?
Can ya, can ya...
That's what I want fo you to feel me....[Hook]
I buy some blow then it better be great
So on you'll never relate
Hard to know how much cheddar we made
Cause there's cocaine on the president's face
You wanna see the Feds run in my place?
I ain't scared I got my gun on my waste
It's hard to know how much money we made
Cause cocaine cover up the president's face

[Verse 1: Dru Down]
(?)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
I'll never be invited to the President's place
But get indicted just for tryna keep my residents laced
(?)
And that's a yacht bout to dock with cocaine in our plates
I pour a five in a pops sippin' lean for the taste
One cup will knock you out like a brick to the face
But this coke will wake you up like a clip in your face
I'm gettin' stoned on the stove turnin' kicks into base
Real niggas show me love when I visit they states
Gave us drugs and guns so our visits were safe
Turn the club up when I enter the place
If you test a thug that'll be the end of your life
We the illest niggas cause we remember the life
2001 we was sendin' them ice
(?) the young bulls up then we send 'em on flights
We got back with the guap and bought what ever we liked

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Blow]
Just copped me some blow time to give it a taste
Sniffin' grams of that clam off the president's face
Us blacks came a long way you see the president's race
Surveillance cameras and hammers control my president's state
Thirty bands in my pants finna get a connect
Then whip a hammer on his ass and make him give me the rest
Major coke just make a quote and I can get it for less
I'm catchin' bodies till Illuminati pay they respect
I've been patient tryna make it now i'm finally free
And diggin' deep tryna find me every time that I speak
I looked at everybody around me and now I finally see
The bigger picture is gettin' richer not just grindin' for sneaks
We was all young and dumb even shot at police
Now i'm scared my son havin' bad karma from me
Until then i'm in my Benz while i'm thumbin' through cheese
You really appreciate the come up when you come from these streets

[Hook][Intro]
Man I'm outa cream
Get your ice cream, ice cream
Not Ice-T not Ice Cube, ice cream
Thangs have thangs
Q P's, zippers what ever you need
Hard, soft get your ice cream
Ice cream
Ice cream

[Verse 1 : Numskull]
Well its the ice cream bitch don't you hear the music
I got the shit fiends want, holla at me when they use it
I got shit sold, I pimp those broke ass nymphoes
Got them sukin dick in pintos
I guarantee its not a soda rock
You can bring cash money
Food stamps, or we can swap stolen goods
For a fat ass dum dum
I sweep the things from they feet with a broom
I rush to the spot where schools of the dope fiends have seen
And they pass other fools up
Nigga jealous cause I got good crack cola
While their shit is packed with baking soda
I'm on the bandwagon why not
Niggas sayin they got the same shit I got
Its because I'm takin the money
Cause I got my shit from bounty
With a little bit of cut in it
All you got is a couple of bucks
Go head and spend it
It's all good
But money ain't all good
Cause a raw deal will get your ass at the Vacaville
My niggas don't have any bucks wit em
Cause of that I don't fuck wit em
I don't fuck with them homies
Cause some of them don't know me
When they tell me what the deally
For a sack of buddha
A got that motherfuckin thing
Niggas jump to they feet
When they hear the music in the street
Get your can get your can can get your can
Rush to the van so you can catch the ice cream man
Bitch don't you hear the music

[Verse 2: Dru Down]
Well it's the Coca Cola man bitch
Can't beat the feelin
Or the real thing yeah you know I got green
So come on a huddle
Give me ten or twenty dollarz
So I can give you rocks or do you want powder
What ever you get I bet you it's the shit
Niggas you know I ripped this shit
Up to the fullest
It keeps the dope fiends comin and comin
Now they runnin
Up to a niggas spot
Its making me hot
I'm about to go sit
I'm goin crazy wit this shit
I'm grindin
I'm slanging through the night
I'm watching tweakers tweak
Because they need a P-I-P-E
Ugh, I look out my window with my motherfuckig Glock
God damn damn I see holes in my van
Checkin them niggas on a corner
You ponk ass niggas
That's why I'm in the house with tha Cola
And some cash stacked to the top
I got more money fool that will make me plock plock
No hesitation and no fear
My observation is to make a milli year
Yeah, and them some daddy will let me his daughter
I'm bothered by this square nigga
Well I'm a work a 25 and you can keep that
Hand me a half sack so I can fill that
Nigga I'm a ride long and super fat jack
Cause I'm a dope dealer motherfuckin cream seller
People ask who I am
Tell them tha Cola Man

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
I need to chop up some cream
Cause the sunshine is bright as fuck
Knocks blowin up my shit
Cause they missed the ice cream truck
Cut up a half and rushed the post
UUU shit, but they don't sweat me cause I look like a school kid
But still I'm watching my back
Cause they will gaffle, pressin my lucks
Slangin right by the hill castle
I got that cream and niggas get jealous
But I don't play that
I got my gap hittin it in the cut
My bundle hittin of quick
Shit, I got glamour
Takin the Glock from niggas with arm and hammer
Come hear take this Glock
I'm sure the nigga will love it
Bring my money up
I'm on alert when I work
But they forever try to get me
Cause I got my kids posted up wit me
That's what I got, I run in the spot, because I advertise
Plus I got the humongous rocks, soda for blocks
Nigga I got more locks then Goldilocks
It's time to make my rounds black
The cops are getting hopeful
I sense they jacked so I get mobile
I got two pop cicles and a cookie left
Shucks, I got myself nine bucks
Cause I give no credit, and I mean that
You won't see that nigga until next month
And when he come to spend
For himself, but he be claming that he comin for somebody else
I had to let him underdstand
It's soooo haaaard tooo saayyy gooood byyyee to the ice cream man(Yukmouth)
Walkin down the street watchin ladies
All night watchin me was the housing authority, task, and OPD
It's rainin it's porin, do it 2-4 no snorin
Posted on the spot with the Glock cuz we warrant
I'm soarin to the top of the deck
Ace in the hole on the grind gigity grind no time fo chasin hoes
Dope fiends love me, come to the spot pushin a buggy filled with kids
"Who got that cola man can you plug me?"
The slugs be on fat but was that a Cadillac
I'm not gun proof some nigga out the sunroof bustin caps
I'm strikin to the bushes but didn't quite make it
They thought it, brakin and takin my shit without my grip I'm naked
I hate it, got smacked across the face wit a sawed off
They roped me up choked me up now I'm hauled off
Wit pumpkin head locked in the trunk
I'm havin flashbacks cuz all I heard was glass packs and hella bump

Probably spooked on the funk wit no parachute
He's willin to jump off the top of the tribune
But no need fo that we commin up elevator strapped bazooka on my back
I'm lyin on the floor prepared for caps

But for a souvenir I cut off tongues
Ridin off safe on the freeway to some hoes house that's sprung

{*engine ridin*}Intro pt. 1: Dru Down

I's um, like chillin in the wind, you know what I'm sayin
Breezy as fuck, I'm like representin the east side of the O
My name DD, if you didn't know, you know what I'm sayin
The Luniz is here to like represent 9-4 and 9-5
Givin it up to you muthafuckas like real live
So take it to advantage and give it up, niggas

Intro pt. 2: CNH (Dru Down)

(C.N. muthafuckin H, hey, fffwussup w-wussup wit that bitch, nigga?)
What bitch?  The bitch that I nutted all up in her face
And was grippin all down her back?
(Huh, yeah, that ol' bitch that uh
Had on that ol' tight ass shit wit them bikinis and shit
Draws was fittin tight!  You know?)
Ehh, after I nutted in that bitch' face
I took a broom and shoved it straight up her muthafuckin pussy
(Cause she a trampy slutty ass bitch, you feel)

[Knumskull]
I'm at the peak of my age; when I wake up my dick's hard as fuck
Steady stickin hoes so you know I don't press my luck
I like to fuck until she bleedin
Don't ask me no questions, afterwards you know that I'll be leavin
I might not leave right then and there though
I'm not givin you no ride, so get up, put on your hair, ho
I got no feelings for hoes at all
Cause I know when they leave, the next nigga fuckin up the walls
So when I have em for a one night, I have more fun than Hasbro
But I don't be fuckin hoes in the ass though
That's a no-no, a nay-nay
I remember to take my dick out, hoes, cause I don't want no babies
It doesn't matter what position we in
Cause when I nut, the cum's headin straight for ya chin
My dick is shootin like a water hose
And if your tits are big and in the way then I'ma water those
Ya think Too $hort was bad
Ho, ya better think twice cause I'ma have you wearin out ya kneepads
And what the fuck is a threesome?
I don't give a fuck about how many hoes, I'm fuckin plenty hoes
It doesn't matter to me nuthin, you can put ya mouth
On my dick, but there just won't be no eatin out
We can have lots of fun though
Take a hit of Henessy, uh-oh, ya better run, ho
Cause I be horny as fuck hittin the yang in the gut
And if you think you can hang then good luck
I'll take ya on no matter what ya think
Ya know shit's all good, just as long as it don't stink
So open up and let me in, and in the end
All ya have is nut drippin off ya chinny chin chin, wit my ...

Break: CNH (Dru Down)
Man, you muthafuckas is dirtier than a muthafucka
That's all y'all talkin about
Just nut and cum and bitches suckin dick and shit like that
(Ay, ay nigga, bring ya ass out the bathroom, nigga, ay
What's that vaseline doin right there nigga?
Yeah, nigga don't tell me it's for ya muthafuckin lips, ha ha ha
Yeah nigga, bring ya ass out nigga, right now)
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin, wussup Yuk?

[Yukmouth]
Yeah, Yukmouth in the muthafuckin house, the crib or the pad
Look out the back of my ass, peep the sag
Love to hit blunts cause that's the shit, but never eat the cunt
When I fuck wit a stunt, that ain't the lick, punk!
Sellin out and gettin sick when ya earl is when
Niggas lick the pearl tongue, fuckin with them girls from
The ghetto, if it wasn't for dukie braids
The hair be nappy that done fucked everybody and they grandpappy
Wearin a rubber can't provoke
A nigga from catchin gonorrhea in the throat, so you choke
I never was a nigga down to eat
I just pound the meat, enough to put a bitch sound to sleep
Most niggas don't know what they doin on it
Ya might as well grab some shit out the toilet and start chewin on it
Cause niggas eat the asshole too
Leavin hella doo-doo on yo tongue, now you sprung on the bitch
(She fucked the crew even) Steven Segal was above the law
And I ain't puttin my lips on shit that ain't above the bra
Hoes pout when on the couch cause I never put my mouth down south
You gotta count me out like Ralph
I'm not a stone cold gentleman but my dick is sensitive
When it goes down the throat and hit the ribs (Yeah)
So open up and let me in; in the end
All ya have is nut drippin off ya chiny chin chin, beyotch

Outro: CNH (Dru Down)
(Yeah, like me, you know what I'm sayin
I'm givin a bitch a golden shower
Ya know, pissin all in the ho' face, ya know
Some of that dirty ass shit, like CNH, tell these hoes!)
Yeah, y'know what I'm sayin
It's that dirty shit, y'know what I'm sayin
For all you hoes out there who suck plenty of dick
Who swallow plenty of cum
And take a fat dick in yo muthafuckin ass, bitch
(Ya cranky ass bitch, yeah)
This somethin to ride to, in the 9-4, ho![Intro]
Hmmm huh huh...
Woooooo...
Yeyah...
It's Dru Down baby
Yeyah..
Comin straight from that izno...
A.K....
No play...
Matta fact...
Listen to my... baby

[Hook]
Can you feel me?
I said I'm doin' what I gotta do, stayin' true to tha crew
Can you feel me?
I said I'm deep down and dirty, I grew up hella early
Can you feel me?
I said I fantasize about tha dreams, havin' big fancy things
Can you feel me?
I can still remember when I stole my first diamond ring

O.K., I'm deep down and dirty
You heard me before
But I'mma kick this shit
Like I be kickin' in some front doors

Now po-po or 5-0
Straight on that real
Always been real
Fifteen blocks down tha
Street from that feel

But still see
Niggas have got it wrong
That po-po is 5-0
And that is my ho

Come and see me some time
Bust a rim and bust a rhyme
After that I fucked that Remy
Bust a rhyme and get a dime

And lets smoke, choke
Until the break of dusk
Fuck that bitch dawn
And puttin' a penny in my palm

Understand this
I rolls deep in tha five
I've been down with tha five
I gets dirty in tha five

And do a hoo ride. (Why?)
That is tha question
Devils be guessin'
Don't question, stressin'

Livin' in tha ghetto
Hello!
Ya betta hear me
And if ya don't
Ya betta really try to feel me...

[Hook]

Momma always told me
It'd be days like this.
So I took myself to Traders
Bought myself a fo-fifth
And some clips

Shit was gettin' hectic
Check this nigga's try ta wrecka
Veteran etcetera
And I bet ya ya life has never been a taken like, I'm deep down and
Dirty early

But see Pearly
At tha age of three
Took my ass in
Beause my momma was deceased

I still ended up a with tha gangsta
Comin' from tha street
Talkin' mentality, causin' casualties
Don't be mad at me
I'm D.D., pimp playa O.G.,
Born up in tha city of tha O.A.K.L.A.N.D
Ghetto-bound hustla, no sucka, serious about my bussiness
What is this? Now dig this, I overnite became rich
I'm me, not tha ordinary nigga from tha street
Grew up, threw up, to what I wanted to be, and what I sing...

[Hook]

It didn't matta my money was gettin' low, I'm on tha struggle
Whatever a nigga go fo, he gots me on tha double
But solo, cause niggas be bitches and snitches at tha same time
But I'm, a go and get my nine
And find these niggas who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to
These bitches, these bitches who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to these
Niggas who be riggas, but I'm a go and hit and do a diggum smack
And take to yo' ass back to tha future
Smoke super, I'm rollin' in tha six eight Couger
A Ruger, a mastermind like Lex Luger
It ain't no thang, like a chicken wing
With tha (mob/wild?) fo from (ozco?), our mission
Is never impossible. Not fo me see, so fuck that old series, you stuck
On that screen I laugh, I'm over mescaline. Aha ha ha.... I see a
Dream as a triple beam, with hella dough from a mutha fucka, with no
Cut bro...

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeyah...
Can you feel me?
D.D....
Grew up, threw up, to what I wanted to be and what I sing

Can you feel me?
Can ya, can ya...
That's what I want fo you to feel me....[Hook: L.V.]
All the freaks come out tonight
Ain't no shootin, no stabbin no fights
It's so tough, oh in the "O" so rough
Skeez's skirt's the town so tight
All the freaks come out tonight
For the dough oh, on the ho stroll

[Verse 1:-Dru Down]
You got some money?(I got a tender)
And you can bend her over the table
But, be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say baby, everything was cool in the 80's
But now it's the 90's, and oh I got's to find me
One of them ladies, who be up in the closet
Come out on holiday's, and birthday's lookin saucy
The party's at the Henry J.Cozier
Ain't nothin but the X.O.,Tanqueray, I can't see no Budweiser
Maybe a little bit of Cognac, that's phat
A little bit of entertainment, patna's that rap
No zapp's, stricly P.I.'s, V.I'S, and Playa O.G.'s
Them little freak nasty's that be rated DD
Be in the town daily in the candy mercedes
But ain't no freaks in the day
I wait fo' the night fo' ho's to get tight
And wouldn't care if they're in pantie's
Or in skin tight leather zebra stripe's, it's midnight

[Hook]

[Verse:2-Yukmouth&Numskull]

[Yukmouth]

This rap here....It goes for all you playa hata's
Handcuff your ho's....that goes for all you captain save-em's
Peep, my major industry, gold teeth and diamond's, been grindin
For nine and half year's, now I'm rhymin
I'm in effect mode like I'll be sure to drink X.O
Pedal to the metal in the Lexo, so understand
How we make em shout like Duran Duran, when we step out the Ice Cream van("..........." BEYOTCH)
Don't you hear the music?
Trick's just loose it, they wanna hit the fluid
But mobb nigga's just do it like Nike, nobody like me
No fella's called me, but when I was just broke ass Jerold Ellis
They was all jesus, we just nigga's who went from wearin Fila's
To rockin Coliseums where they mobbed "My Adidas"
Strapped up wit heater's, nowaday nigga's need a mini K-14
To spray nigga's, they say I got more cream

[Numskull]
Once upon a time in the project's, show
Two briddy's had one idea, break a balla from the East O
Figured out a plan, Num is my man, plotted like a gold-digger bitch
I ain't got end's, so I get tha shit
But I gotta change it around...
Walked her in the bathroom at Snaz Crib
Beat the cock up like she was gettin her ass kicked
After that I got my ass licked, and passed it to my homie's
Once, twice, now everynight she want's to bone me
She think she own me, talkin to my nigga bout marriage
("That's right I don't hear you ,blah,blah,blah, marriage")
The drunk talk, the drunk walk is what I gave her
The next thing I know she started screwin my neighbor(who dat be?)
And that be snack back hack, so bad he ran game on her
So how pimpin do, we ran train on her
So she let the thang take on her mind
Speak it on her like her Pimp Tyte

[Humpty Hump]
It's just the same ol' freak after midnight

[Hook, 1/2]

[Verse:3-Dru Down]
Girl, I rolls in dough like Pillsbury
"Tonight's The Night" like Kris Kross
So let's floss, I be in the midnight freak tosser
Like saucer, puttin thangs down
Got to plan the man
Waitin for somebody like John Wayne, ready to pop at the
Everton with long game
No old school, say it's like "baby what's your name!"
Got at em pimpy doo word's, and I made em just for you baby
All ready can't see you, cause you locked up all the time
Two close for my comfort, too tight like my Nikes
Hit the street's poundin, representin the West Coast sound
One in charge, wanna know the name, it's Mr.Down
Looks so right, sound's right, lit up the night
I never seen you before, so were ya been&were you been hidin?
Proably, havin a bad relationship, steadily fightin
Came to find me someone like yo, problem solver
The man you been you like night, sneak and creep, and wasn't a caller
Let's make it right, and the only way to make it right
Until the midnight, until the midnight

[Hook]You know The Luniz(yeah mean, yeah!)
Don't fuck with those guys man
Because they have this certain way of killing people

(Verse 1: Yukmouth)
Oh no, I think I see the po-po, but how
I'm outtie five thou wit my coke and a smile
Cause now, the cops will beat yo ass for no reason
Hopped in my shit, hit the strip, cause it's bitch season
You know SUMMER, SUMMER, SUMMER TIME
Nigga be like love potion number nine
Espacilly after summer school, ho's wanna cruise to the house
Whip it out, bumpin some of Dru's hits
Cause that shit that she had was real
Perved off the purple head dank, so you know the deal
She gave it up smooth
Fucked her to, "I Never Had A Love Like This"before the old school
Stephanie Mills, bitch let's go, we chill
Big flop, sideways out the parkin lot on three wheels
Downing 40's non stop, leavin fools
Dropped her off, didn't want her number
Cause the cock wasn't on cool
Went to the mall so I could get me these, K-Swiss
Seen my nigga Will&Chris parked at Mickey D's
But as I see, four thick pretty ho's
Jockin Will&Chris cause they be on show video's
Didn't even trip, cause a bitch thought I was large
Gave me a flyer, to a pool party off Mountain boulevard
I said, wassup my nigga C wanna go?
He said park that shit and hop yo ass in the benzo
We went to get the crew but Ted&Ali saw us
Now we on our way up they're wit eight other baller's
We walkin, smokin fatty's, skee thought we had a work
With the back to back caddy's
Throw up the sign, now it's all good
All hoodrat's jockin on our dicks, so you know that the????
We ridin out for some pussy, the bitch I fucked this afternoon
Told some men I raped her, how could she?
The nigga musta been her folks but
He's walkin 'round talkin shit, so I guess he wanna a low cut
But my crew couldn't wait
Meech&C&H started slammin hella nigga's threw da wooden gate
Kevy-Kev, and Will, was firin up bomb, wit my nigga's from the 6-5 Ville
Still, it's goin on, Dru and Tank in the corner gettin blunted
Niggas gettin the ass beat wit technique twelve hundred's
Cause in the(record skips), Oakland niggas don't play
Somebody from the Rollin 20's sprayed a AK
Cause ain't nothin but a G thang baby
Bitches hoppin out the pool wit G-strings
Runnin like crazy
Asses wiggling, didn't see no gentlemen
But I seen Dino pull the chopper out his pendelton
Numskull and Black Donnie was snatchin bitches swinsuits off
Wit Rappin Ronny, Asani, and Ant Banks pulled up on the set
Before I could speak, buff ass meaks
Had swamped them nigga's on they necks
Fuck gettin smoked, I got ghost wit superside
I think a few died, because of that hoo ride

(Verse 2: Numskull)
As usual, full of liqour, don't even give a fuck
Spotted a hoochie, but really don't know if she wanna give it up
She was all that, fuckable for certain
And if she got a nigga then what he don't know won't hurt him
She said her man was a playa hata
I started thinkin bout banks, but the pussy was on stank
She steady givin me actions, so what
Then I'm got some patna's wit me, so hey do you have some cuzzards
She laughed it off, but I'm serious
I got no answer, but I know it's cool, cause she curious
I'm steady watchin my back, cause I don't trust a ho
For as I know, but I still wanna fuck though
So I'm lougin, lookin for her nigga
She wanted to get drunk, and took a swig of my malt liqour
First, she was actin sneaky
The crazy H was in her system and she started gettin freaky
Her nigga seen what was happenin, he was gettin jealous
He was ready to swap, so he called his fella's
Dru Down had seen that nigga swearin up
He called Yuk, and C, so I think it's about fair enough
I heard some knuckle's crack, nigga's got boggled, black
The only thing I see is nigga's gettin stumbled back
They gettin stomped to a pulp
Seen some fool lookin like Shelton and choked his ass wit a????
Yukmouth was drop kickin nigga's like SPLINTER
When it was done, I seen hella nigga's injured
You betta think 'fore you step cause we high
Leavin busta's for dead, cause of that hoo ride

(Verse 3: Dru Down)
I had to checkmate this nigga
Listen to the trigger go bang, I seen my patna him slangin thangs
I mean dogs, so I said wassup y'all
They didn't know what was up so I coughed up my guts somethin fat
Somethin put that heat in that ass
I'mma make that ass fast, I'mma make that ass dash(goin down)
I said get off my folks black, and take that and this
And 'fore I spect wit my???bitch
Brotha's bein sucka's in the nine-trey, leadin to the nine-fo'
Gettin information from ho's
And as you know, that's a no-no, in the East "O"
Listenin to a bitch, startin shit, you got to go
The girls got yo head bent
I'm tellin you to check you bitch because the bitch fear
But now the nigga started actin high-powered
But I can see if yo ass had some dollar's
He let the ho get his into a bucket
Meech mopped that ass, he peeped the flash, and said fuck it
You know it's on, kicks to the dome
But I still can't see how that muthafucka made it home
We made sure he touched everything from the inside to the outside
Cause it's a hoo ride

(Dru Down)
Yeah, Luni muthafuckin tunes in the house
Nine-fo, Nine-three[Intro]
Man I'm outa cream
Get your ice cream, ice cream
Not Ice-T not Ice Cube, ice cream
Thangs have thangs
Q P's, zippers what ever you need
Hard, soft get your ice cream
Ice cream
Ice cream

[Verse 1 : Numskull]
Well its the ice cream bitch don't you hear the music
I got the shit fiends want, holla at me when they use it
I got shit sold, I pimp those broke ass nymphoes
Got them sukin dick in pintos
I guarantee its not a soda rock
You can bring cash money
Food stamps, or we can swap stolen goods
For a fat ass dum dum
I sweep the things from they feet with a broom
I rush to the spot where schools of the dope fiends have seen
And they pass other fools up
Nigga jealous cause I got good crack cola
While their shit is packed with baking soda
I'm on the bandwagon why not
Niggas sayin they got the same shit I got
Its because I'm takin the money
Cause I got my shit from bounty
With a little bit of cut in it
All you got is a couple of bucks
Go head and spend it
It's all good
But money ain't all good
Cause a raw deal will get your ass at the Vacaville
My niggas don't have any bucks wit em
Cause of that I don't fuck wit em
I don't fuck with them homies
Cause some of them don't know me
When they tell me what the deally
For a sack of buddha
A got that motherfuckin thing
Niggas jump to they feet
When they hear the music in the street
Get your can get your can can get your can
Rush to the van so you can catch the ice cream man
Bitch don't you hear the music

[Verse 2: Dru Down]
Well it's the Coca Cola man bitch
Can't beat the feelin
Or the real thing yeah you know I got green
So come on a huddle
Give me ten or twenty dollarz
So I can give you rocks or do you want powder
What ever you get I bet you it's the shit
Niggas you know I ripped this shit
Up to the fullest
It keeps the dope fiends comin and comin
Now they runnin
Up to a niggas spot
Its making me hot
I'm about to go sit
I'm goin crazy wit this shit
I'm grindin
I'm slanging through the night
I'm watching tweakers tweak
Because they need a P-I-P-E
Ugh, I look out my window with my motherfuckig Glock
God damn damn I see holes in my van
Checkin them niggas on a corner
You ponk ass niggas
That's why I'm in the house with tha Cola
And some cash stacked to the top
I got more money fool that will make me plock plock
No hesitation and no fear
My observation is to make a milli year
Yeah, and them some daddy will let me his daughter
I'm bothered by this square nigga
Well I'm a work a 25 and you can keep that
Hand me a half sack so I can fill that
Nigga I'm a ride long and super fat jack
Cause I'm a dope dealer motherfuckin cream seller
People ask who I am
Tell them tha Cola Man

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
I need to chop up some cream
Cause the sunshine is bright as fuck
Knocks blowin up my shit
Cause they missed the ice cream truck
Cut up a half and rushed the post
UUU shit, but they don't sweat me cause I look like a school kid
But still I'm watching my back
Cause they will gaffle, pressin my lucks
Slangin right by the hill castle
I got that cream and niggas get jealous
But I don't play that
I got my gap hittin it in the cut
My bundle hittin of quick
Shit, I got glamour
Takin the Glock from niggas with arm and hammer
Come hear take this Glock
I'm sure the nigga will love it
Bring my money up
I'm on alert when I work
But they forever try to get me
Cause I got my kids posted up wit me
That's what I got, I run in the spot, because I advertise
Plus I got the humongous rocks, soda for blocks
Nigga I got more locks then Goldilocks
It's time to make my rounds black
The cops are getting hopeful
I sense they jacked so I get mobile
I got two pop cicles and a cookie left
Shucks, I got myself nine bucks
Cause I give no credit, and I mean that
You won't see that nigga until next month
And when he come to spend
For himself, but he be claming that he comin for somebody else
I had to let him underdstand
It's soooo haaaard tooo saayyy gooood byyyee to the ice cream man[Intro]
Haha, the remix - 5 on it!
We creepin' in too, baby
We got 5 on ery'thang mane!
We got Dru Down; we got the Luniz! Shock G, wassup?
Numskull and Yukmouth! Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1

[Verse 1 - Dru Down]
You say you got 5 on my tender, you can bend her over the table
But be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brah? No elementary school-ground playing
Not a 5-dollar bill, but 5-double-zero on the real, feel?
I'm on the level, staying mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high-speed but still don't tap the B.B.'s
I'm D.D., Dru Down, baby

[Numskull]
Like Nyquil, I drop fevers; so either put your 5 up
Or you gots to "Leave It" like "Beaver"
Cause see, a nigga perkin' broke'll smoke your spliff all day
Go home and buy big drinky with his briddy then parlay
I got 5 on the Hennessey, Seagram's, or 40's
Cause "This is How We Do It" like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland City, Frank Nitti is a goner
Num' blowing it up like Oklahoma

[Richie Rich]
Put your feev' with my fin, best believe we'll bend
More corners than you thought till something right is bought
More z-sacks? Believe that: tokin!
Where you from? Oakland! Smokin'
In attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy the whole town loves me
At every event I'm sacked up
So if you need me, scream "Double R!" when you see me

[Hook - Michael Marshall]
I got five on it ("got it good!")
Grab your 4, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Messing with that indo weed!
I got 5 on it; it's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got 5 on it: partna let's go half on a sack!

[Verse 2 - E-40]
"E-40, why you treat me so bad?" 40 makes it happen
Fosgate slappin' and revenue grows
From just a little bit of lightweight flamboastin'
Potent fumes, lingering mighty clouds and Northern Lights
You disrespect Vic da Baron
And you'll be violating my civil rights
I'm starting to feel my scrilla
But perhaps today my scrilla ain't feeling me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools, B
Pockets empty, pitching 5, man I'm dusted
Took off my hat, passed it around, man sprinkle me

[Yukmouth]
Me and E-40 to the head, comin' fed plus, you let the lead bust
Ready to do a murda, mayn; perved off the Hurricane
Slurred again, witness what bein' off two-fifths equal
Me killin' people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane!) "Bring the Pain" like Method
Neglected, smokin kryptonite to the brain for breakfast
Guzzle the Hen-do, finsta do the evil that men do
Give me feev', I shall proceed to continue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shock G]
Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around and heard Yuk' and Num', said I gotta be down
Cause new styles is going down: look around you
Tunes from the Lunz spreading round and round you

[Shock G as Humpty Hump]
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still bringing satin for them drawers
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the cause

[Spice 1]
Rolling up cannabis sativa, hitting the Mary Jane
Smoking the 5 before it's 12 o'clock, sipping on Hurricane
Ready to smoke on the indoe; rolling up my window, finna to go to the land
With a handful of broccoli
When it comes to the sticky I'm the man
Crush nasty, I be hitting the J so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke
T-H-C ain't no joke
I got 5 on ery'thing, let's get loaded and smoke
S-P-I-C-E about to hit it and croak

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, wassup baby?
It's me, your boy with the cape that's always tight
You a little short on some ends?
Don't worry, I'll take care of that, I got 5 on that
I got youCydal!
One Step Beyond
Cydal!

Chorus

Money!
(Money found, but broke right now, this Cydal, Mobb.)
Is my everything!
(Money found, but broke right now, this Cydal, Mobb.)
Money!
Ohhoohhh
(Money found, but broke right now, this Cydal Mobb.)
Is my everything!

Verse 1 *(Mr. Eklipze of Cydal)*

Time is simply passin
Got me diggin dead Presidents up
Livin corrupted
So fuck it, there's forfittin
Juss more grippin, how to trap it
No cops attracted
Never fuckin wit telecommunications
So they can't tap it
No fingerprints
No balistics juss tryin to trace on
Game laced on drug free zones
Thugs be on
Some hot power
Rifle tower to rip yo head off
For bread or soak in a puddle of brokeness and stress

Verse 2 *(Yukmouth of the Luniz)*

Now
Who wanna test the "Champion" like Buju Banton?
Plan to leave very few standin when you hand that cannon to me
Been in Dangerous Music like Bohannan
What you mean souljah?!
Ya betta off drinkin King Cobra
Went to clean over there on 8-8
Fo tryin ta playa hate
The straight laced Triple Gold
Break, break gripple holds
I told
That bitch like Joe
Ya bitch
Lil bitch
Lil, lil bitch
Lil bitch!!

Verse 3 *(Numskull of the Luniz)*

I need to stop fuckin bitches for points
Drinkin loochie
Coochie juss ain't my thang now
Hoes in all 50 states got AIDS now
I ain't fuckin wit nothin that's gon' show stop
Money is the root to all evil so I need that to begin
Spend money on hoochies?
Yeah right mutha fucka!
Splittin pussies for free
Bitch, juss to say I'm me
Be the one stackin
I'm backpackin it to school
What you thought?
That I would play the fool?
Bitch I need money!

*(Chorus)*

Verse 4 *(Dru Down)*

Been in an out of traffic
Hella long since I seen a matress
Knots don't stop on the turf
Wearin some 5's, Nike's and a T-Shirt
Little G
Became to be a shark (What?!)
Won't let you fuck wit me
Specialize into that greenery
Meanin to do
Whatever the fuck I wanna do
Even if it means settin up shop by a pre-school
(Progress)
Have them bustas waitin to plot an plan
(Money)
Hangin out the window, bustin pumps wit Tech's

Verse 5 *(T-Luni of Cydal)*

Raised how it sounds
For every portion
Every fortune
Believe a nigga needed some thousands
Proceed
Juss smokin weed an pullin G's runnin from housin
You thought of consequences
When the coppas visit
Got me hoppin fences
Droppin rocks, but I'm survivin from these snitches
And ain't no coppin knots, juss coppin Yola
Youngsta caught up in that street life
700 block of soldiers
But I'm surrounded in this world
Where I'm loved by many
And hated by few
Respected by ya'll
An those that don't they can fall

*(Chorus)* 2x

Money
One Step Beyond[Intro]
Mack playas, ballas, grindas
Yeah I'm the real true pimp of the year
Will ya feel me
Ha ha, pimp of the mutha' fuckin' year

[Verse 1]
Give it up give it up a give it to me
A big mack capitalized Double D, see
And it's on, so I'ma get sick with it
A give me drank and bomb and let me get with it
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year
Goin' around doin' shit like this here
Cause a nigga is strong
And way too long when it comes to my ding dong
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line
So now I know I gotta get mine
It's really no thang to me
See, to be a real true P.I.M.P
Cause I had me a ho or two or mo'
Way back in 80 fuckin' 4
That's when I was a teen
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes
Smackin' hoes, up and down the fuckin' avenues
And ever I do that
I dig a deep in the pocket for the fat gat
Feel me. I'm so goddamn bad
That I had to kick off in a ho's ass
Cause the girl tried to do me
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah, the nigga raped her
But I'm not trippin'
Bitches like you wanna keep on slippin'
So I had to move on
To the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch

[Hook]
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies

[Verse 2]
First thang first on the second verse
I learned a hell of a lot
A get from the get down start
So I had my hoes hoin'
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'
Cause all the game I spit is good shit
And the shit that I spit made me rich
Cause I was all about money
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey
Cause I'm givin' it up quick
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips
Uh, and a bet is better than grey
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney
But I knew she was a fake one
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none
I just walked up to her
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler
And from the get go
I'm just a pimp, ho, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said, "Okay
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today"
Yeeyah, then I said, "Get with it
And don't be a bitch and try to split"
Uh, She was right up under my wing
At the airport at 5:15
She said "Who are you and why are ya here?"
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've got a thang for makin' hoes
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold
And I don't go for talk back
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that
Deduct from the paycheck
Matter of fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac
So I can ride and checkmate
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate
And no I don't play around, fuck around
A when it comes to my money, nigga
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung
I give her Hennessy, a with the one on one
So she can get so high, real high
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy
Cause I'm a kick something just for the hoes
And for myself I keep indo'
And when a ho finds out I'm real, yes I am
Mack playa pimp of the year

Verse 10 *(Keek The Sneek)*

Cashin 'em
Like fresh over fresh
I'm in the Benz
Massagin a bitches my rivalry
Rushed out to get some ends

Nigga I love them bitch half Benz
Strugglin off that gin
Hoes at the bus stop wanna get in
But they
Foot soliders
Not swangin like a Nova
Plus them niggas ain't tight
To make a right an pull my 600 over
Juss as I left I looked to the corner of my eye
That it's them same niggas that bucked at me
But it wasn't my time to die
Ah
Pull out my thang
Hit 'em in the back
Whatever remained
So the bitch stay out my business an let the Benzo skirt
An swang
Yellin Mobb, clouded wit Age
For the nigga I said
"I didn't love yo punk ass
An plus I'm tired of the pain"
Like Cameo this shit is strange
A nigga doin a dude
To get his whole neck an head rearranged
Mobb members, make niggas think about what they doin
Watch what you pursuin
Fuck around an get yo whole career ruined

*(Chorus)* x1

Verse 11 *(Yukmouth)*

Listen
Uh
Little boys an girls listen to me
It is I that you see
Gettin high niggas be
Gettin by on these streets
Do or die on these streets
Hit 'em high meet defeat
Wit 'em tied across the feet
Niggas lie beneath the creek
Many try but don't eat
Much food
Unless I run wit a fool that picks me up in a Lex
FUCK SCHOOL
Let's jet
Live an direct
The Yay Area, they carry a
4-5 an a Tech
When they bury ya they pissin on the side of you grave
No witnesses but a buckshot from inside of the gage
An niggas be gettin pepper sprayed up
Handcuffed an made to lay down
Circumstances
To skanless, manless
To slang a gang
Strapped down
My shit be fully greased up
Hits the mutha fuckin streets up
Cuz niggas ain't takin no beat ups
They re-up wit the heatas
Leaders of the new school
But we don't bust a rhyme
We bust a nine
Mutha fuckas find
Nine's under the bridge in the Pacific Tunnel
Mobb material
Scratch off the serial number
Fuckin balistic so
Roll to the riches
Fuck hoes, bitches, an sluts
Bubblicious Yuk
Booku bucks
My niggas will shoot you up

*(Chorus)* x2

Verse 12 *(Swoop G)*

Now what these niggas tryin to do?
Get gunned down, stomped an pistol whipped fool?
If not I sugguest you get the fuck up out the West
When it come to gun play
There's no contest
I leave you wit two holes
One in yo dome
One in yo chest
An Elliot Ness
He wouldn't have made it on the West
And yes
I know you mutha fuckas heard about us
Cuz we was all on the news
Fo Mobb-Style murders
I crack a fool on top of his head
Wit a strap
Told his bitch to come over here
She sat on my lap
Man this Mobb shit
Ain't never been no joke
You headed straight for the pen
Or you end up smoked
That's why I keep a heater
On my passengers seat
An I'm Mobb Affiliated
Uh, uh
I know you hate it
I rather be caught
With my heater
Then wit out my heater
It's juss a misdemenor

Verse 13 *(Eklipze)*

I'm crackin backs like a chiropractor
Come see a Cydal factor
Get off yo block when rifles splatter
Come across wit a rival chapter
Don't be afraid to be blastin
An don't know nothin bout lastin
An if he flashin
We gassin him
An leavin his ass in a wagon
The last dragon
We smashin
Imagine missin in action
I hit his ass for his cabbage
An dissapeared like Aladdin
An trappin his ass inside a mutha fuckin cave
Niggas that came wit the pistols
I got missles and hand grenades
An some troopers wit bazookaz
Ready to shoot you
Do you in
Crushin boulders wit soldiers
Cook it an make it pure again
It's yo friend the Prince Of Darkness
Whenever the dark hits
I feel my heart get
To beatin an you bustas be my target
PM it's cold heart

*(Chorus)* x2

Verse 14 *(Dru Down)*

We use no parinoia
Or dedication to our paper it's so deep
The paraphanalia to the Mobb
Love to creep
Our elevations is racin
Up to the top
Non-stop
Wit a caulked back Glock
Then hop
Into some cut
To then nigga skirt-skirt
You notice I juss do some dirt
I puttin in work
I hit them were it hurt
Crack yo spine time
Instead of hittin 'em wit my nine
I'm
Strictly wit this hit Mobb shit
Bitch!
Recognize
What a mutha fucka do is steal
Right between your eyes
The nigga was dead before he died
I slide
To the next scene
To the next route
I'm speakin on what I juss did at the head quarters
An to my Mobb soldiers
No one can fold us
Readin the weakness like some Black Jack
If niggas can't handle it
They get stomped from that Mobb attack
An if you come back from that stompin
Lay low
Got 'em
Hard-headed niggas will get they head put on fire

Verse 15 *(Ager Man)*

It's A-G-E once again
Pullin you niggas ho cards
Strapped for them niggas that frontin like bitches
Tryin to act hard
It ain't nothin but the mutha fuckin Mobb in me
I went from sellin coke on the block
To doin robberies
To 'luffin yo ass
Stuffin yo ass
Up in a trunk punk
Caught wit a 3 Times circumstance like T-Funk
Too soon for 'em
Shoulda had a tomb for 'em
Non-ass solider niggas
There'd be no room for 'em
When Pistols Blazin(Yukmouth)
Walkin down the street watchin ladies
All night watchin me was the housing authority, task, and OPD
It's rainin it's porin, do it 2-4 no snorin
Posted on the spot with the Glock cuz we warrant
I'm soarin to the top of the deck
Ace in the hole on the grind gigity grind no time fo chasin hoes
Dope fiends love me, come to the spot pushin a buggy filled with kids
"Who got that cola man can you plug me?"
The slugs be on fat but was that a Cadillac
I'm not gun proof some nigga out the sunroof bustin caps
I'm strikin to the bushes but didn't quite make it
They thought it, brakin and takin my shit without my grip I'm naked
I hate it, got smacked across the face wit a sawed off
They roped me up choked me up now I'm hauled off
Wit pumpkin head locked in the trunk
I'm havin flashbacks cuz all I heard was glass packs and hella bump

And that bitch wit AIDS is takin her drawers off
Call off scratch cuz they fuedin for the bundle
What's tryin to swundle

The dumb ho was trippin so I might not have to dick the cock
Cuz the clique suppose break her off the 50 rock
And she knows that I know that you know
It's like a big ass drought in the O, so fuck that ho
They really tryin ta pump fear and shit
Got that bitch lookin like Ethiopian of the year and shit
I straight escaped cuz they straight got funk
I'm in the front drawing down on each other wit mosberg pumps
I socked the bitch then tied her up, they left the Glock in here
Can't do shit wit it cuz they left a nigga locked in here

(Dru) jump out the window

(Yukmouth)
Man if I do it's my doom, I'm at the tribune
12 stories up in a vacant room
So what the fuck is up, they commin up wit some more niggas
I'm at the door about to go trigga
Happy, my nigga back me
On the quick fast in a hurry like snappy before they cap me
Don't trip cuz I got 4 clips and a grenade
But bring some more shit because they might be hard to fade

(Dru) Neva, I'm comin for yo ass wit the triggas
I'd neva leave ya hangin on the crucifix my nigga
(Yuk) ay ay ay I gotta go man

(Dru Down)
Ay hold on man, God damn
It seems that people always wanna test my real folks
And end up getting smiznoked
I'm finally startin to get sick like Jason
No patience, I needa save my folks he's in the waitin
Probably spooked on the funk wit no parachute
He's willin to jump off the top of the tribune
But no need fo that we commin up elevator strapped bazooka on my back
I'm lyin on the floor prepared for caps
Dru Down, the elevator opens I'm so high
We're lightin up the place like the 4th of july
I yelled Yuk where ya at Yuk where ya at
He came runnin wit the gat and said them niggas dead in the back
I said where da ho go niggaroe
He said I killed the bitch first for tryin to jump on my bone BITCH
And everything is alright
I know your nervous so let me put bud in a pipe right
And lets get into some more shit, some deep shit
Lets burn the dead niggas and the dead bitch
Cuz I could give a fuck less to what happens now
I'm ready to burn the whole muthafuckin buildin down
But I'm not goin out I'm jettin from the murda scene
So yuk either grab the zooka or the m-16
Because my arms is getting tired from weight
I wanna get back to the spot and smoke some dank
Check it out we hopped into the big block chevy
And if somebody ran up oh we was ready
But for a souvenir I cut off tongues
Ridin off safe on the freeway to some hoes house that's sprung

{*engine ridin*}[Hook]
I buy some blow then it better be great
So on you'll never relate
Hard to know how much cheddar we made
Cause there's cocaine on the president's face
You wanna see the Feds run in my place?
I ain't scared I got my gun on my waste
It's hard to know how much money we made
Cause cocaine cover up the president's face

[Verse 1: Dru Down]
(?)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
I'll never be invited to the President's place
But get indicted just for tryna keep my residents laced
(?)
And that's a yacht bout to dock with cocaine in our plates
I pour a five in a pops sippin' lean for the taste
One cup will knock you out like a brick to the face
But this coke will wake you up like a clip in your face
I'm gettin' stoned on the stove turnin' kicks into base
Real niggas show me love when I visit they states
Gave us drugs and guns so our visits were safe
Turn the club up when I enter the place
If you test a thug that'll be the end of your life
We the illest niggas cause we remember the life
2001 we was sendin' them ice
(?) the young bulls up then we send 'em on flights
We got back with the guap and bought what ever we liked

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Blow]
Just copped me some blow time to give it a taste
Sniffin' grams of that clam off the president's face
Us blacks came a long way you see the president's race
Surveillance cameras and hammers control my president's state
Thirty bands in my pants finna get a connect
Then whip a hammer on his ass and make him give me the rest
Major coke just make a quote and I can get it for less
I'm catchin' bodies till Illuminati pay they respect
I've been patient tryna make it now i'm finally free
And diggin' deep tryna find me every time that I speak
I looked at everybody around me and now I finally see
The bigger picture is gettin' richer not just grindin' for sneaks
We was all young and dumb even shot at police
Now i'm scared my son havin' bad karma from me
Until then i'm in my Benz while i'm thumbin' through cheese
You really appreciate the come up when you come from these streets

[Hook]A nigga livin' life like a G
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me

[Verse 1]
It's nothin' but, murder murder and mayhem
Kill you for them blood diamonds like we was in Cape Town, lay down (Brrrat!) Bricks upon the grey hound, send 'em straight to A-town

No mo' rocks, lil' nigga, I'm

We eatin', Dragon Gang

[Verse 2]
Army fatigues, artillery, that's how we get down

Gotta move them kicks now, niggas wanna rent now
The Regime mob is in effect so tuck the shit, pal
Lieutenant made the call, general called the shot
In Makaveli name, we do this shit for Pac
Thug immortal, outlaw like Fatal Hussein
You know the game, * your chain and take two to the brain

[Hook]
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep, I'm livin' in these wicked times, peep
Niggas after me cause they see I'm stackin' g's
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
And that artillery keepin' niggas off of me

[Verse 3]
Who me? livin' just like a G
I'm pushin' that

My hustle

Gotta get it-get it, *

I can't sleep, I'm tossin' and turnin'

[Verse 4]
Once upon a time, dog


Catch a nigga waitin' for me way before I came home

When I'm not 'round here

So good, eyeballin'

So dope with it, anybody talkin' 'bout

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I'm the
I'm the C in 'caine

I'm from the K

You the type to say shit, we the type to * *

[Verse 6]
Oh wee, a nigga livin' life like a G

Knock a nigga off his feet

Try to bury a nigga so deep so we won't

Put a hole in a nigga shirt

[Hook][X2]You know, you know, you’re not alone
You know you’re not alone baby

It was the 1st time, eye to eye, my little butterfly
Caught my attention like a shooting star
Oh so very stunning you are
You’re like the gleam in my ring my precious, pretty thing
Make me feel good like when I’m playing maxed out or smoking trees
Or when I’m wearing a two peace, with the five button up
And no matter what I wear, we just like Sonny and Cher
Everywhere, just a pair looking good as can be
In and out of restaurants
In and out of clubs just you and me
Bottles of Cristal, being tipsy in the wee wee hours
We both looking out cuz we both know I’m MOBked out
You watch my bacc, I'll watch your spine
Matta fact I'll rub it
Like when I'm doggy style from behind, we both love it
Some of that good loving
You like it slow and all of a sudden, and I'mma give it to you like that and more
Never leave you with nothing
Ain't no fronting
Baby girl I love everything about you
And I'm falling major (And I'm proud he made you), plus I'm so glad I met and found you

[X2]You know, You know, your not alone
You know your not alone baby

[Pinky]
When I’m in the car, or whether on the plane
When I’m on the boat, or when I ride the train
Dreaming of me and you
Forever and always, and if you ever need a spot
I got a place for you to stay
No pressure, no strain, I got my own game
I’m the type of dame that will buy you a ring
Sound strange? Well it’s the truth
Got me open, hot and sweaty in this vocal booth
It’s kind of cute cuz we both got fame and loot
Cock back, aim and shoot
Time to blow the fucking roof
What you really wanna do?
Spark flames, scream each others names?
Cuz I’m too hot to tame, but I’m damn glad I came
To get to know you, it feels so nice
Inspired cuz you light up my life
As we lay at night
Gazing at the sun, moon and stars
Due Down and Pinky
Rolling something stinky

[X2]You know, You know, your not alone
You know your not alone baby

You must forgot how I knocked you
It was like sweeping you off your feet in a helicopter
So give me my prop-ers
You forgot I had to dock ya
Because of me making things popping
No stopping a grown man for making his profits
But baby I got ya
Over and over
Thought I told ya
Games and situtitions to get you out of
If you was in any type of trouble
I’ll be there on the double
Ready to rumble
Giving them Pow Pow
Cuz for my angel baby its like that

[Till Fade]You know, You know, your not alone
You know your not alone baby[Hook: Yukmouth] {x2}
Anything goes when it comes to hoes cause big pimping ain't easy
(That's right)
(Unless you breezy)
Na, na, na, na, pimping ain't easy
(That's right it ain't easy)
Big pimping ain't easy
(Nigga is you breezy?)

[Verse One: Yukmouth]
I come in strapped with twin stacks of G's like Siamese
(WHO-HA!)
Then I Busta Rhyme to make your motherfucking spine bleed
Stomp in the 90's like Yo-Yo, fo' sho' yo' nigga smoke the greenery bomb leaves
Walk like zombies under the palm trees
Fuck Armani
No Versace, me and my posse be sloppy drunk off the 'Rassi
Pissing in the lobby
And I be on some new improved big shit
Making moves till I come through draped in jewels like Slick Rick
How is it that Gold Mouth, AKA Yuk, but you can call me Yak
For the way I blaze up sacks back to back
And knock the cool off you conjack, Lee Mannie
Ain't he that nigga balling outta control like Lee Haney
I'm on swole
Detainee on parole, catching felonies
Selling D in the O.A.K.L.A.N.D. inhaling thee chron chron
One stop beyond the bomb shit, bionic
B.I. step aside and Let Me Ride like The Chronic
Now who is these bitches trying to smoke some weed with my crew?
And my nigga Dru
You never knew I hung with players with waves like Amadeus
Just sporting my A's hat, fuck The Raiders
Captain Save Us, handcuff your hoes right now
If you a player, nigga put your mack hand down
Fo' sho'
I say the funky rhymes to make the hoes get naked in the Lexus
No mo' than fo' minutes and some seconds

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Poppa LQ]
Now I'm live and in flesh in 3D
Better yet, cassette or CD, broadcasting from the S.C
Strapped, ya best be, if ya plan to test me
Fall asleep and death is definitely your destiny
I slides like ice and rolls like dice
On these fraudulent, overpriced, female parasites
I bubbles like Moet and spit my game rapid fire like a tec
To make all these bitches panties sweat
Shaking the rookies
Distributing my cavi cookies
And stabbing nothing but top notch imported pussy
They think they speed balling but they really speed falling
Going shopping with the profits they supposed to recop with
And faulty niggas worst habit is rushing to touch and get it
When they know they can't afford to have it
I'm kicking bitches outta my stable cause they ain't able
To match what I'm bringing to the table
And broke hoes is a no no fo' sho' bro
Players are bankrupt from letting bitches free load
These boutique niggas don't want no mail
They'd rather floss but when they go broke
They run around like chickens with their heads cut off
The Feds on his back, repo the Ac'
Escrow the black, plus hit 'em with the RICO Act
Imagine that, niggas hustling backwards now-a-days
But I ain't moving unless I'm getting fucked or getting paid

[Hook]People wonder why they call me Dru Down
Well let me tell ya
Pull a gat so quick
Insane, your life ain't shit
Because I listened to your footsteps follow me
Of course I'm strapped with a gat so your creeping don't bother me
Cause once upon a time in the old school
I got robbed, jacked me by this old fool
But back then, J, I really didn't know no better
That's why I went home and grabbed the .25 Beretta
And ran there fast to the scene of the robbery
Knowing he wouldn't be there
But he's standing on the side of me!
Pop! Pop! I had to do him cause he did me
My name's Dru Down
You shoulda took it more seriously
Nigga, I'm just a playa from the Oak
So recognize game cause I'm a pimp
Also pimpin hoes
I say the bigger the better
Oh I would never
Be a player hater cause I'm a playa
Play ya major
But now I gets off so when it comes to shooting rounds
Well then you will know, punk
Why they call me Dru Down

See, you's a goddamn fool because I'm sick with the shit
I bust the punk off because I'm steady making licks
They call me Dru Down because I'm drawing on these suckers
Your pockets is long? Well let me make 'em a little shorter
Brace yourself! That's what I say when I'm pointing the chrome
Now whacha think I'mma say
When I'm running through your home?
Now picture: me and Ol' Black are running through your damn kitchen
I'll stuff you in the stove and bake your ass like some chicken
Cause I'm the crazy nigga that'll turn and do that shit
I'll make ya screamin' "Yeah!" while yet I'm sayin' "shut up, bitch!"
I finally realized that my name's "make me sick"
Sicka than what you get when you're lying in the cukoo nest
Now see, can you get
With the nigga Dru Down, straight full of it
And if you don't know me
You will know when you hit the town
There's a reason why they call me Dru Down

Dru muthafuckin Down for your ass, two-time
Coming for your mind

Earning the name Dru Down is kinda difficult
You wanna try to earn my name? Buy a gat and start shootin' fools
Cause to get my stripes I was no punk
I walked the streets in '89 with a gauge pump
But now it's '93 I got a new spot
I made it real hot
But went and bought me a brand new black Glock
Shooting motherfuckers in the leg
Pistol whippin suckas, hittin' em dead in the head
Cause I don't give a fuck, nor do I care less
But just to be aware I'm being strapped with a vest
Cause if I get caught on the sleep
I'll bet you motherfuckers wanna fill me with some heat
But I'm not going for it pull a fully, use all rounds
And then you will know, punk
Why they call me Dru Down

Three times for your motherfuckin' minds
Punk motherfuckersIntro pt. 1: Dru Down

I's um, like chillin in the wind, you know what I'm sayin
Breezy as fuck, I'm like representin the east side of the O
My name DD, if you didn't know, you know what I'm sayin
The Luniz is here to like represent 9-4 and 9-5
Givin it up to you muthafuckas like real live
So take it to advantage and give it up, niggas

Intro pt. 2: CNH (Dru Down)

(C.N. muthafuckin H, hey, fffwussup w-wussup wit that bitch, nigga?)
What bitch?  The bitch that I nutted all up in her face
And was grippin all down her back?
(Huh, yeah, that ol' bitch that uh
Had on that ol' tight ass shit wit them bikinis and shit
Draws was fittin tight!  You know?)
Ehh, after I nutted in that bitch' face
I took a broom and shoved it straight up her muthafuckin pussy
(Cause she a trampy slutty ass bitch, you feel)

[Knumskull]
I'm at the peak of my age; when I wake up my dick's hard as fuck
Steady stickin hoes so you know I don't press my luck
I like to fuck until she bleedin
Don't ask me no questions, afterwards you know that I'll be leavin
I might not leave right then and there though
I'm not givin you no ride, so get up, put on your hair, ho
I got no feelings for hoes at all
Cause I know when they leave, the next nigga fuckin up the walls
So when I have em for a one night, I have more fun than Hasbro
But I don't be fuckin hoes in the ass though
That's a no-no, a nay-nay
I remember to take my dick out, hoes, cause I don't want no babies
It doesn't matter what position we in
Cause when I nut, the cum's headin straight for ya chin
My dick is shootin like a water hose
And if your tits are big and in the way then I'ma water those
Ya think Too $hort was bad
Ho, ya better think twice cause I'ma have you wearin out ya kneepads
And what the fuck is a threesome?
I don't give a fuck about how many hoes, I'm fuckin plenty hoes
It doesn't matter to me nuthin, you can put ya mouth
On my dick, but there just won't be no eatin out
We can have lots of fun though
Take a hit of Henessy, uh-oh, ya better run, ho
Cause I be horny as fuck hittin the yang in the gut
And if you think you can hang then good luck
I'll take ya on no matter what ya think
Ya know shit's all good, just as long as it don't stink
So open up and let me in, and in the end
All ya have is nut drippin off ya chinny chin chin, wit my ...

Break: CNH (Dru Down)
Man, you muthafuckas is dirtier than a muthafucka
That's all y'all talkin about
Just nut and cum and bitches suckin dick and shit like that
(Ay, ay nigga, bring ya ass out the bathroom, nigga, ay
What's that vaseline doin right there nigga?
Yeah, nigga don't tell me it's for ya muthafuckin lips, ha ha ha
Yeah nigga, bring ya ass out nigga, right now)
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin, wussup Yuk?

[Yukmouth]
Yeah, Yukmouth in the muthafuckin house, the crib or the pad
Look out the back of my ass, peep the sag
Love to hit blunts cause that's the shit, but never eat the cunt
When I fuck wit a stunt, that ain't the lick, punk!
Sellin out and gettin sick when ya earl is when
Niggas lick the pearl tongue, fuckin with them girls from
The ghetto, if it wasn't for dukie braids
The hair be nappy that done fucked everybody and they grandpappy
Wearin a rubber can't provoke
A nigga from catchin gonorrhea in the throat, so you choke
I never was a nigga down to eat
I just pound the meat, enough to put a bitch sound to sleep
Most niggas don't know what they doin on it
Ya might as well grab some shit out the toilet and start chewin on it
Cause niggas eat the asshole too
Leavin hella doo-doo on yo tongue, now you sprung on the bitch
(She fucked the crew even) Steven Segal was above the law
And I ain't puttin my lips on shit that ain't above the bra
Hoes pout when on the couch cause I never put my mouth down south
You gotta count me out like Ralph
I'm not a stone cold gentleman but my dick is sensitive
When it goes down the throat and hit the ribs (Yeah)
So open up and let me in; in the end
All ya have is nut drippin off ya chiny chin chin, beyotch

Outro: CNH (Dru Down)
(Yeah, like me, you know what I'm sayin
I'm givin a bitch a golden shower
Ya know, pissin all in the ho' face, ya know
Some of that dirty ass shit, like CNH, tell these hoes!)
Yeah, y'know what I'm sayin
It's that dirty shit, y'know what I'm sayin
For all you hoes out there who suck plenty of dick
Who swallow plenty of cum
And take a fat dick in yo muthafuckin ass, bitch
(Ya cranky ass bitch, yeah)
This somethin to ride to, in the 9-4, ho![Dru Down]
Met a fly bitch, she hooked me up with another fly bitch
But I wanted to hook up with the first fly bitch
But it's alright bitch, I went along with the plan
Asked the bitch "Who's your man?", someone she couldn't stand
But supposedly, you know how them hoes be
(Leave 'em shakin', scared, mash up out that window)
Now the ho shook up and don't know where to gizo
My ways say pay, smooth paper, no bumpy rizoll
You already bought the tape so game bein' sizold
Don't start no shit won't be none, so girl don't play no reezole
Everything I say is manufactured to capture
You're old school, I need the bank, you're caught up in my rapture
But bein' as sharp as I am I seen the vision from the left eye
Seein' I'm bein' approached and by someone who just ain't lookin' right
He said (Nigga give me my ho) Who is you? (Cutthroat)
Is that so? (Fo' sho) Nigga oh (Nigga oh)
This nigga frontin' in front of my ho, he must don't know just how the game go
So I spoke softly, looked into his eyes and let him know
Formally introducin' myself, I'm one of the dopest
Hair fanatic, to the mind memo potent, I'm mackadocious
Pockets one of the fattest, capital P.I. status
Your ho re-chose, you're fired, she want me to manage
Now he's huffin' and puffin', this sucka gettin' uptight
He reached into his coat but that wasn't no fight

[Hook]
Don't shoot pimpin', because I'm pimped out
Pimpin' on a bitch now, partna learn the rules file
Don't shoot pimpin', because you got a ho
You see me with a ho plus 2, 3, 4, 5 more!
Don't shoot pimpin', because my game tight
Hair whipped, nice car, clean fit, a real pimp
Don't shoot pimpin', when pimpin' ain't did nothin' to you
Nigga hoes come and go, double up fool

[AMG]
I told her freeze baby, on your knees baby
I hope you ain't go no disease baby, let it breathe baby
Maybe we can take a cruise, in between what I choose
Lips or hips, and I hope you don't bruise
Easily we the P's - AMG and Dru Down-Down-Down
Wit it wit it, come and get it
The Bay to L.A., touch down on a ho
I'm a veteran bitch, you know why your mouth soaked
Sometimes I play, never pay, CLK in the city
Keep your toes pretty, no sadity
Bitches I got, pussy steamin' up the spot, make it hot
Take they knot, how you think I got what I got?
304 cold, keep these hoes in a broke mode
Reallionaire status, my bitch has got the baddest
Ass you ever seen, a millionaires wet dream
Suck it 'til it's clean baby

[Hook]
Don't shoot pimpin', because I'm pimped out
Pimpin' on a bitch now, partna learn the rules file
Don't shoot pimpin', because you got a ho
You see me with a ho plus 2, 3, 4, 5 more!
Don't shoot pimpin', because my game tight

Don't shoot pimpin', when pimpin' ain't did nothin' to you
Nigga hoes come and go, double up fool

[Suga Free]
Ho I'm 999,000 ~ 999 dollars and 99 cent away from gettin' rich, now get bitch
Now if I hang around 9 broke motherfuckers just like you... I would be the 10th!
He he! She wanna go get it but you won't let her go
You gots to admit it, your heart is in that ho
I'd like to teach y'all tricks to be, just like Suga Free
Stay fly for life and let a ho be a ho, and keep a pimp stick company
Now how you pimpin' partna? Ho Saver
Tryin' to hide her freaky behavior
Put her to work, that's how I came up
(Ho ho ho, Green Giant) Don't shoot the pimpin'
It's Suga Free and Dru Down, baby baby
And if you choosin' me baby you gots to pay me
You're just one less, page to answer
Just one less, ho to look after
So when she tryin' to hurt the pimpin', it's gonna be eez-alreezight
And when the player haters gon' get to hatin' and bein' fake
It's gon' be eez-alreezight

Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba... playa haters
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba... don't shoot the pimpin'Verse 1 *(Seagram)*

Uh
Sweatin in the kitchen
Cookin 3 chickens
I'm Chef Boyardee
When it comes to a key
43 OZ's is what I see
Everytime fa sho
Latex glove so it don't get into my pores
Hardcore to the marrow
4-5 barrell
Yo my dinero
Is bein stacked an packed away for a rainy day
I slang caine
Mayne through the Bay
Hey!
A-K's is packed on the regular
Funk my competitors
And the predators
Who like to plot my riches and my misses
But she packs a duce-duce Gucchi really misses
Suspicious
Niggas didn't flip the pain
You couldn't watch Scarface to get this game
Or the Godfather
Or New Jack City
I'm from the crew with no pity
The 60's like Ripley's
'Believe It Or Not' I'm top notch
Sippin on scotch on rocks
And it won't stop
I stay down an ready for my fedi
No matter the cost
The Chevy I floss
See Eddie's the boss
I get crossed by the pigs
I can smell the sweet aroma
You didn't know 6-9 was in no cahoots
Try to warn ya
About fuckin wit my paper route
I got major clout
Throughout
The south
The north
The west and the east
It's the Seag struttin nigga
Gettin more than a piece of the pie
The sky's the limit
It's the authentic 6-9 apostile
Makin niggas seek the gospal

Chorus *(Yukmouth, Dru Down)*

Nigga
What would you do if you ain't got your strap?
Would you get yo ass jacked?
[Like this, like that?]
Nigga
What would you do if you ain't got your strap?
Would you give up yo scratch?
[Blap, blap!]
Ha
What would you do if you ain't got your strap?
Would you get yo ass slapped?
[Like this, like that?]
Bitch
What would you do if you ain't got your strap?
Would you nut up and scrap?
[Blap, blap!]

Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*

I'm goin out like 2Pac
Shootin 2 cops in the ass crack
When ever the task jack the turf I be the first to blast back
Make that ass "BACDAFUCUP" like Onyx
I puff up chronic, that make ya vomit like Ginatonic
(you know me!)
Gold D's on trophies every summer
Can't see me
Might wonder if I'm ballin on the unda
I never be givin a fuck, but quick to get my grind on (trick)
The nigga who slips is who I'm quick to pull my 9 on
Sheeit!
Now break it down, down break it
Can't make it, so I take his grip and leave him pistol whipped
Stripped butt naked
I cooks up bricks of A-1 Yola
The soldier til it's ova
Slappin bitches wit the Motorola
I know a busta, you know a busta too
Juss a few on my shit list to get licked
You mutha fucka you
Shoulda known the game was deep now
Around the East Bound
We'll buck you up and fuck you up to see you six feet deep now

Verse 3 *(Dru Down)*

I'm juss an East Side Soldier
Born at Kaiser
Ever since then I have been on the rise up
Came out the diaper from a switch to a big stick
I'm in the mix
And yes I'm like steadily foldin the grip bitch
Whoo!
I want you to know that I'm Down
I'm Down in the Town
I'm drawin down
I'm Dru Down
On who now?
And niggas wantin to do who?
But niggas couldn't do me if they wanted to
I'm out to pull you
Whoo!
Who?
You
Who?
You
You'se an owl mutha fucka now what fool?
Another sucka put in the gutta
Came the wrong way
I accidentaly had the A-K
And sprayed
I shot
He shot
Hella shocked
He thought it was a plot
(He didn't know I got stripes on my side)
Why not?
Lame to the game
No skills that's real
No glory in the East Side Soldier story

Verse 4 *(Pooh Man)*

Masked murderer
Psychopathic villian
My dick is on hard when your guts start spillin
Put my Glock
Caulk
Your body drop
Let off 7 shots
And my lead is hot
Tore through your vest
Ate through your flesh
All 7 in your chest and your laid to rest
Nigga don't you know, ain't no room for guessin
Class is in session meet Mr. Smith & Wesson
Watch the bodies all drop
When they hit your block
It's when you know when I reach for my chop
No need for drama
Cry for mama
I'mma
Hit you wit this lazer beam sight and take you life
After the lead melts through you cranium
Entering you mind like titanium
Yeah!
Your punk ass potna shoulda told ya
You done fucked up
An ran into an East Side Soldier

*(Chorus)* 2x

*(Dru Down outro)*

Blap! Blap! Blap! Blap! Blap!

International Blunt Funk biatch
Rilla than real!(Verse 1: Numskull)
I'mma hustla to the heart, pardon me dolly
I mastered the dice large, and even three card molly
Slappin bozo nigga's for twenty bucks a rock
Plus I slang mad rocks on the spot, FUCK THE COPS
Now I'm on the ball, cause it's all good in the hood
I'm glad as fuck, dropped outta school because I hate math and stuff
Lay low, runnin off my pager, can't press my luck
STINGY AS FUCK, wit my bucks like Scrooge McDuck
NOBODY COULD, stop the operation stackola
Get back roller, you can't fuck wit this crackola
Because I got the carribean, plates just like a nubian
Happy so the five-0 won't jack me
Fuck the jail shit, it's corny
BITCHES KNOW I'm HORNY
The nigga's that I hang wit got crew cause life is corny
We precieve the gat to the end so that you know
Shit I pull more bitches then menaudo
Let me quit, the nigga's on the spot wanna take me out
DRIVE BY MS.DAISY, to raise me, and take me plot
I got ya duckem, don't slip for nobody(fuck em!)
Schemes gettin thought up, I'm never gettin caught up
Keepin my pockets so fat, swift on my feet
Sayin I'm out to the fools that's on my street

(Verse 2: Yukmouth)
Well it's the CRAP SHOOTER
Love to hit the fat buddah sack, and you know that
My crew comes together like ?????
Raised in the ghetto's of OAKLAND
Had dope in my pocket, servin knocks in the open
Walked close, and door close when I was on the night shift
Got a few indictments, day to day excitements out my life quift
Rollin in my cousins big K-5
Holy moly, I stay high by drinkin 40's
Had roly poly dice in my pocket for the school house crap game
I had a DANGLE ROLL, sometimes I wanna STRANGLE HO'S
But I scoop em like a spoon full of cereal
Never ate a trick cause that's for kids duke you hear me though
But rigger though, never was rigor-mortis so face it
Pocket's on fat like a Jenny Craig patient, IT AIN'T SHIT
But a come up, when I roll up on they knock
Fuck pops, I gotta have my props
I'm runnin shit like FLO JO
Never fucked a HOBO
But I got my DICK SUCKED
Now she's got the HICCUPS
I wakes up, move a ???head if ya dangle
I'm down, you'll fuck around and get ya neck strangled
To swing a sell, and chop rocks to the whole dim sprayer
Cause what I got will make ya sing a song like the Gap band
Likes ta DANGLE MUTHAFUCKA'S OUT THEY CASH LIKE A SHISTA

(Verse 3: Dru Down)
Well I'm the sickest, wickedst nigga you'd wanna be
A damn fool from the streets, killin enemies
And as I'm sleepin in my street I'm havin nightmares
I'm FULLY PREPARED, AND FULLY AWARED
And strapped wit the armorgauge
And as a nigga wakes up, I'm havin thoughts of a murder scene
Robbery, OOHHH, I had to hit the streets
FEELIN, FEELIN, I like the fuckin smell of some flesh
KILLIN, KILLIN, I like to put a whole lot in yo chest
A maniac, runnin down the streets in the ghetto
I see a limo, a white man in tuxedo
Tryna be slick, BUT HE'S A TASK
Knowin damn well he wouldn't catch me, I'm too fast
Cause I will bust a gauge or two
'Rupt the fuckin living rooms
And If I had to getway, I'll find another place to stay
Cause I'mma slick, quick nigga you can't fuck wit
A brotha from the gutter doin dirt, AND I LOVE IT
Afterwards, I'm chokin like a damn fool
Smokin on the blunt, a yabba, dabba, fuckin do
Cause I'm luni like the luni fuckin tunes
I need to go snatch a purse so I can rent a room
SOMEBODY JUMPIN OUT THE BUSHES WIT A STRAP Y'ALL
Checkin everything except the shit in yo drawers, y'all
I know ???? is sweepin nigga's off they feet
A murderize killer, sick fool from the street, yeah[Dru Down]
You got me ready to put it down like this bitch, in a real fashion
If you scared don't listen, I'm not lookin' for federal attraction
Ho I'm smashin' on you, and your whole crew cause I love you
But fuck you, you gon' make a nigga straight up buck you

[Kurupt]
I ain't no busta so don't play me like no fool on the streets
All I need is a piece, and somethin' to eat
Havin' flashbacks of times, big pimpin', big riches
Gamin' up all the little and big bitches

[Dru Down]
About the riches, I wants to bury mine in ditches
For the penny pinchers, fuck all hoes that's out to get ya
This here is business, because that ass you can't protect
Take it like a real woman, bend over doggystyle bitch

[Kurupt]
Yo homie I'm a fool when it comes to the game
Takes all a nigga got not to blast off shots
So I'mma just stay calm and remain composed
Cause it's the same old story just different hoes

..

[Bad Azz]
Money-money-money and bitches to go with it
And guns for those niggas who think they gon' get it
Gain power and control, all eyes surveyin'
Be respected by those who ball over me
Movin' conspicuous, capitalize on legal tender
Money circulates with any race or gender
You into life or knowingly playin' close to death
And the grind only occupy time before death

[Dru Down]
We rockin' up rocks, while my woman at the spot
On the block, down comes the door - at least 15 cops
She didn't know never, I shoulda know better
But I gots to get the cheddar
No matter however, whatever it's gon' take
Cause I can't go broke, that means you gon' break
That's for the false fake, that's why I gots to
Keep me a down bitch on the list with a grip, for real bitch

[Kurupt]
Man she's bad to the bone plus deadly as sinai
Rollin' in a G-ride with a half a bird inside
On the way to drop the stock off, in case it pop off
Got a Glock to top off, there's a twister to drop off
Sensual, seductive, a bad lil' bitch
I don't want a lot baby just a little bit
Me and the homies dippin' in cruise ships
Dru Down and Bad Azz, Kurupt and Daz

..[Dru Down]
Ha-hah, yeahh, this for the ladies
I know they didn't think Dru Down
Was gonna leave em out like that there
Give me head, move them shoulders
Look at them hips, open them legs
Give me sex
Hah, I'm still baggin em

Chorus: repeat 2X

Head, shoulders, hips and legs
Oh baby work that body like you're havin sex

[Dru Down]
Can you baby?
Would you baby?

Do the, splits, I bet you in bed you put in dicks
The way you move, you got Dru Down overruled
You're like a rubber band with stretch pants
I never seen you befo', on my flo', doin that type of dance
Booty shake (WHOO!) and then you broke it down to butterfly
(Don't hurt them toes!) I might want you up in some pornos
Two other freaks walked up with that look, got off the hook
On the ground, hella fools stuck, throwin bucks but scare to touch
(But what fo'??
They wouldn't be here, half naked, at the after hours pants throw)
And goin solo, that's why the people playa over here in Polo
Ah with the RoRo, and what they don't know
I do this for a livin, it's Hill-in, ah watchin a freak dance
Expressing sexual feelings
And if they really off the hook I'm climbing up the ceiling
But won't wet my pants, that might take a slow dance
Yeah.. real slow.. major slow.. now dig that!

Chorus 2X

[Dru Down]
Now I got one on my back and one in the front
Gettin smashed like a sandwich, but I can manage
Ain't no damage, let it be known, I'm from the Town
And broke it on down on they ass, don't get mad!

(Ah nah, you gonna have to get off me now)
(Yeah, you doin a little bit too much)
Hold on, I mean what?
(It ain't even all that)
(That's it, that's all baby)
Like that?
(My feet hurt, take it on elsewhere)
(Don't touch my butt)
Ay ay, so baby, where y'all goin?

But like some bees in a pack I'm deadly swarmin
Once I bump em in the ring
I'm knockin it out like champ George Foreman
Whip that on me like you whipped it on that dancefloor
What's wrong, that head shoulder lips and legs sore?
Give me some head girl, move them damn shoulders!
Wiggle them hips, open them legs, give me sex (What you say?)
Give me some head girl, move them damn shoulders!
Wiggle them hips, open them legs, give me sex

Chorus 2X

[Dru Down]
For real doe.. you know what I need?
I need a freak, ah with a body that'd shake just like Jell-o
I got game, I start my convo with "Hell-low"
And let it known that there's more where that come from
(Like what?) A true philosophy, like a gut sprung
And then they wanna come to the crib
Start undressin, wanna teach a lesson
Just for spittin, a dibba dabba doo, in her ear
That was practice for the Pimp of the Year
I'm Dru D-Nex, ain't no stoppin, I'm P poppin
When I'm off of the Tanquerays I'm ridin
It surprises me, this lady bought me a strawberry daquiri
I turned around she's stickin and lickin that long tongue at me
But how a mack be, is like this -- straighten yourself up
Then roll, and don't forget to walk with a limp
Hit the table, made her proper pick a flow
I didn't know her name, but I had her in pain

I mean I had her FREAKY
I mean I did exactly what I wanted to!

Chorus 2X

[Dru Down]
Yeahhh baby!
The whole point is you work that body baby!
Like you havin sex
This is rated V.D
Pimp Playa O.G
P-I-M-P-I-N, G in me
Understand me though, y'know? Dig
