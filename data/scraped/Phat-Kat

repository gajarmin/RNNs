Yo, for all the niggas in the D

[Hook]
Don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us

I bet you wouldn't see a million MC's if it was all about skills
Puffing on blunts sucker sporting Tommy Hill
Figured that that stuff would be so fat
Like the rhymes I bust, and you didn't hear me cuss
Not yet, but it's about to get live in this bitch
You ho niggas done blew my high, now I'm in your shit
Making hits while you other suckers be riding the dick
Bringing drama to your clique, like Susan Lucci
Your style played out like MC Brains and Oochie Coochie
That shit died out, you couldn't keep up with the times
You got to move over, these real niggas 'bout to shine
Like my diamonds on your punk ass in the sun
I bust flows to keep you hoes on the run
Detroit, Phat Kat, straight from the Midwest, never fess
Shit stay fresh like money blessed
No second guessing, the wrong nigga to be testing
Fuck around Swanson'll be your place to rest in

[Hook x3]

I'm that guy who made you suckers wanna rap
I'm that nigga who put Detroit on the map
Been on hiatus, come back and get props like the greatest
Rocking the latest, that's why you phoney niggas hate us
Hearing you hoes got my right hand itching
I've been ripping flows way before the days of the Rhythm Kitchen
Phat Kat, born and raised in this bitch
Niggas claiming my city don't even stay in this bitch
All in they raps, busting caps, selling dope
You and five of your crew, y'all still couldn't ante off of C-notes
Broke niggas kill me while real niggas feel me
You saw me sticking your ho you still couldn't peel me

[Hook x5]

Ayo I see we got a
Up to me we got too many niggas faking
Lying on their digs and all the moves that they making
Chance they taking, trying to roam through my zones
From Twist City, the place where Phat Kat calls home
Where niggas talk twenty four hours on Bernie Mac phones
Catch me at a show, a spot's guaranteed to get blown
Know niggas with hearts so cold they froze like snow cones in the winter
You's a beginner, trying to test this vet (nigga)
So when you see me on the streets talk to me quick
Because you never know what the fuck you might get
So dig it, sugar sugar and um, sort of soft
If you didn't get off it ain't my fault
Remember that, Phat Kat coming with nothing but the vintage
1st Down tear a line out your crew, let's have a scrimmage
While you portraying images you seen on TV
That shit is gay I told you niggas that Detroit don't play

[Hook x4]

(Been in this game for years, it made me a animal)[V-Stylez]
MoSS, I'm..
The wrong type of cat, gritty nigga and I'm evil
Out for the presents, sneaky dude, call me Smeagol
Lord of the ring and when the bell go "ding"
Jabs looking very sharp, punches hard and clean
You never land, I'm too elusive for your amateur game
Spit it well, you didn't know? You better check my name
V-Style, get it right and I rep the D
Where everybody hood hard, yo I just emcee
It don't matter if you big or tall or who the shortest
Just show me where the challenge is at, call your florist
Cause I'mma John Wayne on your ass, that's true grit
Talk slick and I would damage your top, wig split
D-X on muh'fuckers, silly dudes can +Suck It!+
Take my twins from my waste, blast my Kirby Pucketts
Yo my brain propane, gas turn into flame
Straight fire when ignited, break you down to the grain

[Royce Da 5'9"]
G shit, we sick, we spit, fuck you
Pay me, fuck all that free shit, eat dick
Crew shining like shit, we split, she strip
We tip, blue diamonds got mammy all seasick
Now take a brief sit, here's a handkerchief tip
While I fall on the floor, 'nuff money for a cheap trip
Huh, bitch, now who I'm finna leave with?
Find a friend and come, who you wanna get on your knees with?
My jewellery sick, I got a disease on my wrist
My neck and the shit's making me freeze bit
Breeze in with my Angela Jolie bitch
She lick my underarms, you can call me B. Pitt
Any problems nigga, we fix, my bitch
Will hit you, be like boiling water nigga, she slick
That's a trip saying he slip
Always on point like a Christmas tree tip
Creep up and eat clips

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Aiyyo, I know you like how Rapper C is waiting
Cause D niggas recognize thee nigga waiting
Rapper remain patient, took jabs like a champ now
Every verse out need the Rapper Pooh stamp
I tramp on foes, face down for them hoes
Pity the fool, any fool likely to oppose
See right through them clothes and your real nigga pose
Real niggas won't say a word, case closed
Blessed with the pen game, take aim
Maimed your career off of this strain, the disdain
All on your face mayne, it's plain with no competition
Me and you in the same breath, don't mention
This is my position right now in the future
Sewing up careers like some well-done sutures
These are maneuvers, up the ladder I ascend
Clash of the titans, nigga fuck a new trend

[Elzhi]
This nigga biting while I'm thinking, writing, to get the ink ignited
So when he move it's like a streak of lightning
Fuck where the crowns at, this brown cat could leave the town flat
And beat you like the part of the speaker you pump the sound at
I'm not stopping the slot topping, so when I plot
Dropping something hot, you copped it, it got popped in
Vultures better duck, flows with lead is tucking
Expose the feather ducking, blows your head to chunks
Rip flyer before I dip, be quick, hip fire
Slip by you a line that goes off like a trip wire
I'm from the sickest city, your whole clique is kiddy
If your chick is pretty, she'll suck a dick, I'll lick the titties
Your type of rhyming got me bored but I'm a star
The kind that you found where the comics are, knock you off your feet
Fussing, I eat dozen, I move the streets, trusting
In some sweet crushing petite Russians, skeet bussing
Screaming like they bout to meet Justin
Timberlake, I tremor quakes, hemmers shake
I'm the one with the gems and cake
Extra smokes and skinny dips like naked folks in swimming lakes

[Phat Kat]
Around the world my fans know me for the flows I bust
The Polo I rock and hoes I crushed
And the sound of my voice turn haters to dust
But still making funky music is a must
The newest star in Catacombs giving haters the flux
I switched it, bounced it, upgrade to super-deluxe
My whole crew is dangerous, ain't no taming us
The fast get wound on point, the finger's blaming us
Simply, oh, oh, it's the year of the emcee
We're here to fill the void, the game been running on empty
Had a long day nigga so please don't tempt me
Cooked so much beef but my name ain't Wimpy
Bout to snatch all your customs, your bag's too skimpy
And my shit sound fresh when this the voice in this empty
Tongue's so sharp, I chop you niggas down to mincemeat
So fuck your money, jewels and cars, using it as camouflage
Need to focus on planning the strength in your bars
It's Phat Kat the living legend, still counting my funds
Because I never kissed no ass, I stuck to my guns
While you're still coming up short, Kat holding the fort
Dedicate this to my fans, thanks for all your support
Yeah, this cold steel bitches, it's how we do it and it's real bitches
Yeah, it's Ronnie Kat

[V-Stylez]
Yeah, it's your man V-Stylez
Royce 5'9", Phat Kat and Elzhi
The Rapper Big Pooh from Little Brother
And MoSS on the beat bringing the heat
It's Hip Hop, non-stop[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D

Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 1-Griot]
I'm from a place where the agents send
It's a age of sin, no matter what grade ya in
Not the muscle, it's the hustle that's made within
Dyke ten's, Bangor rims persuade the grin
Hustle up in the PJ's, no time for relay races
Gettin' big money, that's how we change faces
Never been ill with a pill like Mike
And sound ill on the mic, matter fact, yo, I'm realer than life
Gee and crate niggas still on the mic
Break niggas who be feelin' they hype, aight?
Clown ass niggas makin' my profession a joke
I drown ass niggas up to they throats, choke on a quote
Talk six to the God is blasphemy, they ask from me
The lesson that blow, the answer to the question is "No"
While ma' fuckas keep testin' the flow
LE be in the D, we blessin' a show

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 2-Big Tone]
Yo, we don't lean up at the bar, niggas, malt liquors
Spillin' off in a cup, Grenadine Corona from a small pitcher
Pertinent Rip Hamilton jersey half tucked
Jake's Porter house thick, tossin' 'round hits
In the city of Boom, hit my city with tunes
That instantly bloom buds before a industry move
We bust, anything move, leave it right where we seen it
Leanin', rap shit, D shit reachin' ya region
Air One's crispy enough to squeak on the cement
Hood rich, sharper than the crease on my jeans is
Savage beast to a beat, one son of a mean bitch
Genetic make-up in trade of a Lizzy street kid
I watch destiny, from the shot to the ebony
Waitin' in the wings, patient with a dream
Poppin' out a collar, them sleeves bust, wavin' at my bean
With them characteristics right there in the Mitten

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 3-Phat Kat]
Ugh, the stripes I got from the game will fill up both of my sleeves
I sit yo ass down for good like Christopher Reeves
Situations like this, better to give than recieve
Four wolves 'll bite that ass, homes, so please believe
Eat you down to the bone and bring some back to me
Around the cassy, some be better than the last nigga
Put down them guns and bet I'll whip yo ass, nigga
Don't get it twisted, I'm just provin' a point
With the raps gloryfiyin', doin' time in the joint
In the land with ya man got yo ass locked up
While yo woman in the free world with her ass knocked up
Where Blacks with crazy years fuck cocaine rocked up
Turn on the TV, all you see is people slain, chopped up
We in Iraq fightin' for oil, still price shot up
And around election time, watch Bin Laden pop up, yeah, yeah

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah, I like this shit

[Verse 1: Phat Kat]
You know over the years
I've seen emcee's come and emcee's go
Niggas on tour gettin paid doing wack ass shows
With gay ass flows y'all all some hoes to me
Phat Kat who you thought it was suppose to be?
You got a hot single now your ass 0 for 3
Phony niggas like you don't even come close to me
I'm from, Detroit City where my styles ain't free
Wanna hear some real shit? You gotta pay me
Gift was passed down through my family tree
My momma, my big brother, my two sisters and me
Ronnie Cash the ill bastard B
Get caught crossing my path end up a Kat-astrophe
Niggas is mad cause they hoes is drafting me
Fuck around with P going down in 3
Seconds flat put your bitch ass right on your back
Thats what you ho niggas get for fuckin with Kat
When my crew roll through you don't want no parts to that
Puttin flows to tracks in less than 10 minutes flat
Yea, want no parts to that
We putting flows to tracks in less than 10 minutes flat

[Hook:]
Oh oh, one time for your mind
It's game time
You know what I'm sayin'?
Here it is ya'll, yo yo yo
Hot damn, I'm the man, it's the man
I reside in the D you know
In the D ya'll, and this goes out to
All my hustler motherfuckers


[Verse 2: Phat Kat]
Ayo, I could give less than a fuck or whoever you claim to be
But Phat Kat on a mission to save The D
You suckers kill me watching too much TV
That's why most you hoes looking funny to me
When they say that shit, y'all go portray that shit
You brainwashed cause all day the radio play that shit
You think I care about your gold and platinum plaques nigga?
I tell you to your face that your ass is wack nigga
You know you bit your style from a fuckin wack nigga
A student, so please don't get it diluted
Undisputed D.E.T.R.O.I.T
Phat Kat that real nigga roll with that crew S.V
And I, got the key to be a true emcee
You lack the ability, discipline, swiftness, agility
Rhymes like these will leave you in mental facilities
On the fo'realla B [hooooo]

Ayo, yo, yo, turn it down a lil' bit
Ayo, let me know if this shit ever happen to you

[Skit begins][Intro]
Ronnie Cash
Carte Blanche
I told y'all it don't stop
For real
Show you how I get down for real
It's what you niggas a get

[Phat Kat]
I told you every time I spit I'm on some classic shit
Ronnie Cash and J Dilla on some massive shit
Why y'all niggas still fakin' on that plastic shit
We in the lab, concocting bombs, straight blastin' shit
When my red range changing lanes, pass that shit
Chicks at the lights, gotta 'em flashin' ass and tits
Called my wolves, niggas quick to have they asses bit
You know it's on when they pull up in them classic whips
Jumpin out with long barrels with expansion clips
Now you silly niggas really know its time to dip
Treat you like a broad, make you niggas dance and strip
You rappers need a style, I'm here to give you fashion tips
I'm in Belize having breakfast with the baddest bitch
Go ahead, smoke the [?], I'm blowin' lavish spliffs
Ronnie Cash, bitch, it don't get no liver than this
Carte Blanche, waiting on your little guest list
Yes this

[Elzhi]
From cowboys to indians, cops and robbers
Bloods and crips, Bush and Saddam imposters
Slugs from clips, trippy to the [?]
Thugs and pimps, man they moving their drugs for chips
They dug a ditch for little Leroy
He was only three
Cannon blown out stuffed animals on a tree
Froze to a stray bullet
Though it beared no name
When it whistled through the air prepare for aim
What could make a man cock and squeeze
On a block with ease
Pop through trees and knock the leaves
Somebody's shot can't possibly breathe
Possibly be, reach in your pocket for keys
Probably be between robbery, gangs, and dope fiends
For the coke dreams and get high from the vains
You got hitmen that's high as slain individuals
Now they live below the flowers in spring
Hear them lead showers that *pring* from under vehicles
You can read a few new leads into about the people who was killed
I'm sure when they planned before it
[?] same way yesterday and before it
You can high and fade away, pick up the plan, ignore it

[Phat Kat]
You phony rappers had your turn now it's time to go
I'm here to bring you live shows with legitimate flows
You still be rolling 50 deep, sweet as Cinnamon rolls
[?] black ten and a roll
Ronnie Cash, stay on the low, gettin that dough
I'm in that [?], nigga, watch my growth
I'm masterminding [?] all types a shit
But if I recite, ask that papi write my shit
They download me on the mp3, they bite my shit
While I sit back, roll my 3's,  relight my spliff
Spit your crystal flows, don't [?] bitch
I'm here with your main girl, you still wifin' that chick?
Right before I blow my load I put it right on her lips
I compliment your taste, dawg, she's got some marvelous tits
She comin' home, kissin' you, now that's some trifling shit
The type of shit that makes you wanna do some stiflin' shit
Like put your hands around your chick neck then tighten the grip
You couldn't keep your cool, but you couldn't follow the flip
[?]
You used to be a boss, now I just bought Kool-Aid on ya lips[Phat Kat]
Radio be like he raw cuz he cuss in his raps
Neighbors say he to loud, he be bangin' them tracks
Fuck that I'm from where gats be busting
For a blunt or some chili fries, give them rats to suckers
Still fronting, ?? still mashing buttons
Since '95, Kat can bless you with the classic rough shit
Scrape that pain, straight from the barrio, blast it, cup it
And the wolves I run with they quick to blast a musket
Same blade you pulled out when your ass got stuck wit
That's what you get when you step to Ronnie Cash with tough shit
Never been that one with that ass, betting to bluff shit
Tuck your ring, watching your chain, your scared we'll cuff it
Y'all some actors, no y'all some actresses
Fucking with Ronnie Cash, so y'all can rest in piss
A in't just a rap, I'm an artist nigga
Don't get me started nigga
The life I live will make a bitch out of the hardest nigga
I need a tech, for post dramatical stress
For survival draw, while soldiers were layed to rest

Hook: [Black Milk] (2x)
Keep going, keep on, gotta keep the streets on
To keep the heat flowin'
See tha weed blowin', on up, still down
Shining, look at us now nigga

[Black Milk]
So I might as well drop a verse on 'em
Black teamed with Kat, that's your first warning
Black teams to bat, like how I approach the green
Home run, Sammy Sosa swing
I'mma show you why I'm supposed to be
The real crack music, approach the fiends, they approaching me
I approach a beef around there
Nigga your career will go down hill like Kobe's team
So cold wit heat, the flow cold like frozen meat
The whole damn globe should freeze
Or the whole damn globe should heat like cocoa
Holdin steam, your hand can't hold the drink
Yeah I'm still focused B, still focusing
Showboat like hocus-pocus, take notice
Put a hole in the flow, have your boat just sink
Y'all niggas really thought it was over
Naw, nigga we reside in the Motorcity
Take cover when they roll up
Like po-po when they show up
Sho' nuff, back seat riding down P.A with a chauffeur

Hook (2X)[Intro - Elzhi - talking] (*echo*)
Up early
Top of the morning to you weak idiotic motherfuckers
It's new Phat Kat and Elzhi
Yeah nigga!

[Verse 1 - Phat Kat]
Your now listenin to the voice of reason
I do it for you hatin cocksuckers and the none believin
Here's another classic for y'all to sink y'all teeth in
Don't be mad at me and mine cause y'all still underachievin
We out cold in the D, me and my niggas stay freezin
I ain't friendly, fuck all that smilin and grinnin
Quick to turn a situation to the start of your endin
Where niggas is grimy, we all got cases just pendin
Face on America's Most Wanted, try to find the defendant
You silly rappers, still yappin about your cars and your wheels
Truthfully you need to focus more on buildin your skills
You're still, stuck in a time warp, we light years ahead of y'all
Real on the comp, I smash all competitors
I'm ill with the battles, too clever with the metaphors
Dilla told me 'Kat, keep your foot on they neck
And don't even breath on a track unless they cuttin the check'
A lot of suckers won't like it, but they gotta respect
How I don't water my shit down for the record execs
A lot of suckers won't like it, but they gotta respect
How I don't water my shit down for the record execs

[Hook - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
Now put your hands up high
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)
Yeah, you know it sound fly
(Yeah nigga)
We bringin hip hop back, it's no lie

[Verse 2 - Elzhi]
Modern day Alex Haley, off the Bailey's
Strikin niggas on the daily, for comin out they face like Israelis
It's so blissful, listenin to the official
There's no issue, the flow could melt a snow crystal
I bring the drama and spring the armor out my bomber
Like Osama, I quote, your float on the ways of karma
The crowd pleaser, give your child a mild seizure
Rock a style Caesar, run with crooks and wild skeezers
Vacate your premises, him against your nemesis, equal hemorrhages
Bad dreams and foul images
Y'all real funny, when I rain it spills runny
While it's still sunny, I bill money and drill hunnies
DJ's on the wheels spun me
At the right clubs, even lit up the white pubs like lightbulbs
Top notch, trippin off of movies off my watch
Drinkin scotch, observin as I watch what you botch
Yeah, it's the phenomenon, disguised as a common don
Spittin kamis, bombs, grenades, you laid, remember my grade
The phlegm that I sprayed, sharper than a Samaurai blade
Bet it could trim a guy's fade

[Hook - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
Now turn your levels up high
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)
Pour the Henny and spark the ty
(Yeah nigga)
We livin it real, 'til the day that we die (die)

[Verse 3 - Phat Kat]
The phony MC's, they speak my name in vein is blasphemy
Probably mad cause his ho tried to get after me
Cross my path and end up a catastrophe
I told you the flows I rock nigga, they come naturally
Elzhi he told me 'Kat you shinin
And with every line that you spit, it's like your levels is climbin'
Cause in the booth, I'm the savior
The fruits on my labor
Used to have me on the top of the roof with a laser
Kangaroo boots and my pager
Crew your get paid a, if they gank some loot and a major
Tore off half of your leg and the blast only graze ya
Don't gamble with your life cause Detroit niggas will fade ya
Got fans all over the land from London to Jamaica
Paris, France, Asia, Hampton and Malaysia
Lost the whole day flyin from Sydney, Australia
Back in L.A., I caught the Pistons and the Lakers
Butter pecan, she got the haters catchin vapors
I seen the world, I've been all over this bitch
And my mind is rich, you need to try to find your niche

[Hook - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
You gotta keep 'em up high
(Yeah nigga)
We want to see you touch the sky
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)

[Verse 4 - Elzhi]
Yo, I'm the chose king, when flows swing, the blows sting
Hoes cleanin my clothes, I stand out like nose rings
At any given time I will shatter the soul
Your head and your hat is just rolled, I splatter your hole
It's the confusin words, makin 'em confusin
Words of what you heard, how to die losin
Niggas remain cheesed, they main squeeze is on they knees
As my trainees on how to give me a brain freeze
Now me the prick, was flyin bullets out the heater quick
To feed a click, I'm even sweeter when the beat is sick
Dick long as that centimeter stick
Chicks feel it in they stomach like it's a fetus, when the fetus kick
Pullin thoughts out of thin air that my pen share
I'm been rare, even if I came as a twin pair
Oh no, the flow doesn't end there
Strokin my chin hair, I'll send flares to clear it out like skin care
Provoke the scanner, better be in a jokin manner
Cause my spoken grammar, comes equipped with cloak and dagger
Good luck shit, I'm the one you can't fuck with
In a truck lit, by the crib near the lake, where the doves sit
What bitch (what bitch, what bitch ...)[V-Stylez]
MoSS, I'm..
The wrong type of cat, gritty nigga and I'm evil
Out for the presents, sneaky dude, call me Smeagol
Lord of the ring and when the bell go "ding"
Jabs looking very sharp, punches hard and clean
You never land, I'm too elusive for your amateur game
Spit it well, you didn't know? You better check my name
V-Style, get it right and I rep the D
Where everybody hood hard, yo I just emcee
It don't matter if you big or tall or who the shortest
Just show me where the challenge is at, call your florist
Cause I'mma John Wayne on your ass, that's true grit
Talk slick and I would damage your top, wig split
D-X on muh'fuckers, silly dudes can +Suck It!+
Take my twins from my waste, blast my Kirby Pucketts
Yo my brain propane, gas turn into flame
Straight fire when ignited, break you down to the grain

[Royce Da 5'9"]

Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us

I bet you wouldn't see a million MC's if it was all about skills
Puffing on blunts sucker sporting Tommy Hill
Figured that that stuff would be so fat
Like the rhymes I bust, and you didn't hear me cuss
Not yet, but it's about to get live in this bitch
You ho niggas done blew my high, now I'm in your shit
Making hits while you other suckers be riding the dick
Bringing drama to your clique, like Susan Lucci
Your style played out like MC Brains and Oochie Coochie
That shit died out, you couldn't keep up with the times
You got to move over, these real niggas 'bout to shine
Like my diamonds on your punk ass in the sun
I bust flows to keep you hoes on the run
Detroit, Phat Kat, straight from the Midwest, never fess
Shit stay fresh like money blessed
No second guessing, the wrong nigga to be testing
Fuck around Swanson'll be your place to rest in

[Hook x3]

I'm that guy who made you suckers wanna rap
I'm that nigga who put Detroit on the map
Been on hiatus, come back and get props like the greatest
Rocking the latest, that's why you phoney niggas hate us
Hearing you hoes got my right hand itching
I've been ripping flows way before the days of the Rhythm Kitchen
Phat Kat, born and raised in this bitch
Niggas claiming my city don't even stay in this bitch
All in they raps, busting caps, selling dope
You and five of your crew, y'all still couldn't ante off of C-notes
Broke niggas kill me while real niggas feel me
You saw me sticking your ho you still couldn't peel me

[Hook x5]

Ayo I see we got a
Up to me we got too many niggas faking
Lying on their digs and all the moves that they making
Chance they taking, trying to roam through my zones
From Twist City, the place where Phat Kat calls home
Where niggas talk twenty four hours on Bernie Mac phones
Catch me at a show, a spot's guaranteed to get blown
Know niggas with hearts so cold they froze like snow cones in the winter
You's a beginner, trying to test this vet (nigga)
So when you see me on the streets talk to me quick
Because you never know what the fuck you might get
So dig it, sugar sugar and um, sort of soft
If you didn't get off it ain't my fault
Remember that, Phat Kat coming with nothing but the vintage
1st Down tear a line out your crew, let's have a scrimmage
While you portraying images you seen on TV
That shit is gay I told you niggas that Detroit don't play

[Hook x4]

(Been in this game for years, it made me a animal)[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah, I like this shit

[Verse 1: Phat Kat]
You know over the years
I've seen emcee's come and emcee's go
Niggas on tour gettin paid doing wack ass shows
With gay ass flows y'all all some hoes to me
Phat Kat who you thought it was suppose to be?
You got a hot single now your ass 0 for 3
Phony niggas like you don't even come close to me
I'm from, Detroit City where my styles ain't free
Wanna hear some real shit? You gotta pay me
Gift was passed down through my family tree
My momma, my big brother, my two sisters and me
Ronnie Cash the ill bastard B
Get caught crossing my path end up a Kat-astrophe
Niggas is mad cause they hoes is drafting me
Fuck around with P going down in 3
Seconds flat put your bitch ass right on your back
Thats what you ho niggas get for fuckin with Kat
When my crew roll through you don't want no parts to that
Puttin flows to tracks in less than 10 minutes flat
Yea, want no parts to that
We putting flows to tracks in less than 10 minutes flat

[Hook:]
Oh oh, one time for your mind
It's game time
You know what I'm sayin'?
Here it is ya'll, yo yo yo
Hot damn, I'm the man, it's the man
I reside in the D you know
In the D ya'll, and this goes out to
All my hustler motherfuckers


[Verse 2: Phat Kat]
Ayo, I could give less than a fuck or whoever you claim to be
But Phat Kat on a mission to save The D
You suckers kill me watching too much TV
That's why most you hoes looking funny to me
When they say that shit, y'all go portray that shit
You brainwashed cause all day the radio play that shit
You think I care about your gold and platinum plaques nigga?
I tell you to your face that your ass is wack nigga
You know you bit your style from a fuckin wack nigga
A student, so please don't get it diluted
Undisputed D.E.T.R.O.I.T
Phat Kat that real nigga roll with that crew S.V
And I, got the key to be a true emcee
You lack the ability, discipline, swiftness, agility
Rhymes like these will leave you in mental facilities
On the fo'realla B [hooooo]

Ayo, yo, yo, turn it down a lil' bit
Ayo, let me know if this shit ever happen to you

[Skit begins][Intro]
Yeah, Caltroit shit. Phat Kat AKA Rhyme Pat P.A. Ronnie Cash. Yeah. Uh

[Phat Kat]
Yeah, you know I had to get 'em
Phat Kat AKA Ronnie Cash is bout that wickem
Wrong place, wrong time, caught in a fucked up position
On that ass like a Pit when the master says "sick 'em"
Amber Alert file cause your ass came up missin'
Found three days later, your head needed some massive stitchin'
Your lucky cause your family could be goin' casket pickin'
I'm in style like Red Bull and Bud watchin' asses gigglin'
Call me Ronnie Cash cause I'm filthy rich in the mind
Life's so bright, so no need for ice to shine
20 years in the game, still sharp with the rhymes
Spank little nigga, send him home cryin' to they moms
Got 313 ways to rip y'all apart
Where should I start?
Niggas not true to the art
When they really need to focus on their flows and they timin'
Up in their videos shinin'
Rockin' their conflict diamonds
Rewind what I said and let that shit sink in
Too many rappers rappin' but they really need to be fans
Rewind what I said and let the shit sink in
Too many rappers rappin' but they really need to be fans

[Hook]
Yeah, that's how we do it
We go at it
Watch us do it to you
Don't panic
We got y'all doin' it too
So savage
Shit might ruin your crew
Mo' havoc
Got a little cocky, just shoot
Go at it
Watch us do what we do
Don't panic
We got y'all doin' it too
So savage
Shit might ruin your crew
We go at it
We go at it
Go
We go at it

[Elzhi]
You know the pharaoh
From doe deniro
The flow is thorough
I let it go like a bow and arrow
I've always kept a slick chick
Quick to grow a halo
Hoppin' on my thick dick
Stick with no apparel
I affect minds
The way I connect lines
Respect mines
My neck shines like electrons
So is the wrist
The poet insists
He fold a nigga just to show that his shoulders can kiss
And any fool is lost
Once a rhyme is out my book
Took
Watch him look shook as a dual exhaust
I'm cruel of course
If you make me blow my cool and frost
Blaak Blakk!
Then the tool is tossed
See my rep's malicious
If you step, then I'm kept suspicious
I might have crept till you slept with fishes
Y'all really need to practice twice
I axe and dice
Till the track is sliced like the back of Christ
I'm still
Tight and skilled
You will frighten
My grill is still writin'
It might be how lightning feel
For real
I've gotten used to
Me havin' a loose screw
Way back when Marley Marl produced for the Juice Crew
I need two chicks who's down for the deuce screw
I make it three
Mistakenly
You thought I wouldn't break your knee
And your back spine
Then I'm back grindin' like a nigga takin' E
I need my dough sittin' high in bills
But for now I take the ho sittin' high in
High end heels
When this hit man for hire kills
You need a buildin' like fire drills
And skate off when the tire peels

[Hook]

[Bishop Lamont]
Yo, I got it
Belligerently, deliberately, diligently, skillfully
That spits artillery
Shell cases pile up your facility
My photo look like Lobo Cop
My fo fo pop like Robo
Pitch your logo on your polo
Split your Domo A Regato pronto
Ask how I flash mash smash slash gas staff and fag fans fast
With the axe just like Tonto
Get scalped clowned stomped out, knocked out it's that simple
Raise your hands, you see stars just like King Hippo
Mayday, runaway
We Pearl Harbor shit all day
Got harder armor, come and bomb ya
Harm ya, blow your crew away
Nagasaki, Hiroshima
Walkie Talkie for more back up
Tell them motherfuckas better send some niggas meaner
Death Star, rock star
Pull up like a cop car
Hop out and hope niggas wanna blow you up like Akbar
Leave your back charred
Nigga please
You ain't spittin' shit
My dick get mo' hard
California push the line like the Coast Guard
Feel niggas, real spittas, it's time to bogard
Fuck the labels, radio
Ev'body get it
Pop my Glock out on you niggas like that Hell Date midget
Get twisted
More statistics
Stretched out, chalked out
Reminiscent of Hieroglyphics
My Souls Of Mischief
Flows malicious
It's Bishop motherfuckers
Tivo it if you missed it

[Outro]
Yeah, slow it down, slow it down, slow it down
Yeah. Switch it up on 'em. What I want you to do
Is see you just bounce. Bounce nigga. Yeah bounce
Yeah. Black Milk. Elzhi. Phat Kat. My nigga Bishop[Phat Kat]
Radio be like he raw cuz he cuss in his raps
Neighbors say he to loud, he be bangin' them tracks
Fuck that I'm from where gats be busting
For a blunt or some chili fries, give them rats to suckers
Still fronting, ?? still mashing buttons
Since '95, Kat can bless you with the classic rough shit
Scrape that pain, straight from the barrio, blast it, cup it
And the wolves I run with they quick to blast a musket
Same blade you pulled out when your ass got stuck wit
That's what you get when you step to Ronnie Cash with tough shit
Never been that one with that ass, betting to bluff shit
Tuck your ring, watching your chain, your scared we'll cuff it
Y'all some actors, no y'all some actresses
Fucking with Ronnie Cash, so y'all can rest in piss
A in't just a rap, I'm an artist nigga
Don't get me started nigga
The life I live will make a bitch out of the hardest nigga
I need a tech, for post dramatical stress
For survival draw, while soldiers were layed to rest

Hook: [Black Milk] (2x)
Keep going, keep on, gotta keep the streets on
To keep the heat flowin'
See tha weed blowin', on up, still down
Shining, look at us now nigga

[Black Milk]
So I might as well drop a verse on 'em
Black teamed with Kat, that's your first warning
Black teams to bat, like how I approach the green
Home run, Sammy Sosa swing
I'mma show you why I'm supposed to be
The real crack music, approach the fiends, they approaching me
I approach a beef around there
Nigga your career will go down hill like Kobe's team
So cold wit heat, the flow cold like frozen meat
The whole damn globe should freeze
Or the whole damn globe should heat like cocoa
Holdin steam, your hand can't hold the drink
Yeah I'm still focused B, still focusing
Showboat like hocus-pocus, take notice
Put a hole in the flow, have your boat just sink
Y'all niggas really thought it was over
Naw, nigga we reside in the Motorcity
Take cover when they roll up
Like po-po when they show up
Sho' nuff, back seat riding down P.A with a chauffeur

Hook (2X)[Intro - Elzhi - talking] (*echo*)
Up early
Top of the morning to you weak idiotic motherfuckers
It's new Phat Kat and Elzhi
Yeah nigga!

[Verse 1 - Phat Kat]
Your now listenin to the voice of reason
I do it for you hatin cocksuckers and the none believin
Here's another classic for y'all to sink y'all teeth in
Don't be mad at me and mine cause y'all still underachievin
We out cold in the D, me and my niggas stay freezin
I ain't friendly, fuck all that smilin and grinnin
Quick to turn a situation to the start of your endin
Where niggas is grimy, we all got cases just pendin
Face on America's Most Wanted, try to find the defendant
You silly rappers, still yappin about your cars and your wheels
Truthfully you need to focus more on buildin your skills
You're still, stuck in a time warp, we light years ahead of y'all
Real on the comp, I smash all competitors
I'm ill with the battles, too clever with the metaphors
Dilla told me 'Kat, keep your foot on they neck
And don't even breath on a track unless they cuttin the check'
A lot of suckers won't like it, but they gotta respect
How I don't water my shit down for the record execs
A lot of suckers won't like it, but they gotta respect
How I don't water my shit down for the record execs

[Hook - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
Now put your hands up high
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)
Yeah, you know it sound fly
(Yeah nigga)
We bringin hip hop back, it's no lie

[Verse 2 - Elzhi]
Modern day Alex Haley, off the Bailey's
Strikin niggas on the daily, for comin out they face like Israelis
It's so blissful, listenin to the official
There's no issue, the flow could melt a snow crystal
I bring the drama and spring the armor out my bomber
Like Osama, I quote, your float on the ways of karma
The crowd pleaser, give your child a mild seizure
Rock a style Caesar, run with crooks and wild skeezers
Vacate your premises, him against your nemesis, equal hemorrhages
Bad dreams and foul images
Y'all real funny, when I rain it spills runny
While it's still sunny, I bill money and drill hunnies
DJ's on the wheels spun me
At the right clubs, even lit up the white pubs like lightbulbs
Top notch, trippin off of movies off my watch
Drinkin scotch, observin as I watch what you botch
Yeah, it's the phenomenon, disguised as a common don
Spittin kamis, bombs, grenades, you laid, remember my grade
The phlegm that I sprayed, sharper than a Samaurai blade
Bet it could trim a guy's fade

[Hook - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
Now turn your levels up high
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)
Pour the Henny and spark the ty
(Yeah nigga)
We livin it real, 'til the day that we die (die)

[Verse 3 - Phat Kat]
The phony MC's, they speak my name in vein is blasphemy
Probably mad cause his ho tried to get after me
Cross my path and end up a catastrophe
I told you the flows I rock nigga, they come naturally
Elzhi he told me 'Kat you shinin
And with every line that you spit, it's like your levels is climbin'
Cause in the booth, I'm the savior
The fruits on my labor
Used to have me on the top of the roof with a laser
Kangaroo boots and my pager
Crew your get paid a, if they gank some loot and a major
Tore off half of your leg and the blast only graze ya
Don't gamble with your life cause Detroit niggas will fade ya
Got fans all over the land from London to Jamaica
Paris, France, Asia, Hampton and Malaysia
Lost the whole day flyin from Sydney, Australia
Back in L.A., I caught the Pistons and the Lakers
Butter pecan, she got the haters catchin vapors
I seen the world, I've been all over this bitch
And my mind is rich, you need to try to find your niche

[Hook - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
You gotta keep 'em up high
(Yeah nigga)
We want to see you touch the sky
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)

[Verse 4 - Elzhi]
Yo, I'm the chose king, when flows swing, the blows sting
Hoes cleanin my clothes, I stand out like nose rings
At any given time I will shatter the soul
Your head and your hat is just rolled, I splatter your hole
It's the confusin words, makin 'em confusin
Words of what you heard, how to die losin
Niggas remain cheesed, they main squeeze is on they knees
As my trainees on how to give me a brain freeze
Now me the prick, was flyin bullets out the heater quick
To feed a click, I'm even sweeter when the beat is sick
Dick long as that centimeter stick
Chicks feel it in they stomach like it's a fetus, when the fetus kick
Pullin thoughts out of thin air that my pen share
I'm been rare, even if I came as a twin pair
Oh no, the flow doesn't end there
Strokin my chin hair, I'll send flares to clear it out like skin care
Provoke the scanner, better be in a jokin manner
Cause my spoken grammar, comes equipped with cloak and dagger
Good luck shit, I'm the one you can't fuck with
In a truck lit, by the crib near the lake, where the doves sit
What bitch (what bitch, what bitch ...)[Intro]
Ronnie Cash
Carte Blanche
I told y'all it don't stop
For real
Show you how I get down for real
It's what you niggas a get

[Phat Kat]
I told you every time I spit I'm on some classic shit
Ronnie Cash and J Dilla on some massive shit
Why y'all niggas still fakin' on that plastic shit
We in the lab, concocting bombs, straight blastin' shit
When my red range changing lanes, pass that shit
Chicks at the lights, gotta 'em flashin' ass and tits
Called my wolves, niggas quick to have they asses bit
You know it's on when they pull up in them classic whips
Jumpin out with long barrels with expansion clips
Now you silly niggas really know its time to dip
Treat you like a broad, make you niggas dance and strip
You rappers need a style, I'm here to give you fashion tips
I'm in Belize having breakfast with the baddest bitch
Go ahead, smoke the [?], I'm blowin' lavish spliffs
Ronnie Cash, bitch, it don't get no liver than this
Carte Blanche, waiting on your little guest list
Yes this

[Elzhi]
From cowboys to indians, cops and robbers
Bloods and crips, Bush and Saddam imposters
Slugs from clips, trippy to the [?]
Thugs and pimps, man they moving their drugs for chips
They dug a ditch for little Leroy
He was only three
Cannon blown out stuffed animals on a tree
Froze to a stray bullet
Though it beared no name
When it whistled through the air prepare for aim
What could make a man cock and squeeze
On a block with ease
Pop through trees and knock the leaves
Somebody's shot can't possibly breathe
Possibly be, reach in your pocket for keys
Probably be between robbery, gangs, and dope fiends
For the coke dreams and get high from the vains
You got hitmen that's high as slain individuals
Now they live below the flowers in spring
Hear them lead showers that *pring* from under vehicles
You can read a few new leads into about the people who was killed
I'm sure when they planned before it
[?] same way yesterday and before it
You can high and fade away, pick up the plan, ignore it

[Phat Kat]
You phony rappers had your turn now it's time to go
I'm here to bring you live shows with legitimate flows
You still be rolling 50 deep, sweet as Cinnamon rolls
[?] black ten and a roll
Ronnie Cash, stay on the low, gettin that dough
I'm in that [?], nigga, watch my growth
I'm masterminding [?] all types a shit
But if I recite, ask that papi write my shit
They download me on the mp3, they bite my shit
While I sit back, roll my 3's,  relight my spliff
Spit your crystal flows, don't [?] bitch
I'm here with your main girl, you still wifin' that chick?
Right before I blow my load I put it right on her lips
I compliment your taste, dawg, she's got some marvelous tits
She comin' home, kissin' you, now that's some trifling shit
The type of shit that makes you wanna do some stiflin' shit
Like put your hands around your chick neck then tighten the grip
You couldn't keep your cool, but you couldn't follow the flip
[?]
You used to be a boss, now I just bought Kool-Aid on ya lips[scratches]
{*"Now who bringin the dirt.. who bringin the dirt"*}
{*"Take it to 'em hard"*}
{*"It's official"*}
{*"Dog you better than that"*}

[Phat Kat]
Yo I'm changin my karma then the anger that I'm harnessin
The flame that I'm charterin remains in the bargainin
Restrain cause I'm harborin the lane to your martyrdom
Enslavin and hollerin they came from the father son
And holy ghost is modern
Explainin why I'm chargin 'em enslavin the homonym
Reclaimin the Cottage Inn - acres of new farmer gin
As niggas wanna ras stop at Cathouse so hop on in
I aim and disarm 'em
Dangerous and dotterin, blame for the sovereign
Detroit hip-hop for James and his mom and them
Got ravens to rotten mens engaged and I'm locked in
You praise and you honor him
For King that is optimum
(It's Ma Dukes back at you with another D-D-D-Dilla exclusive)Http://www.lyrics.com/game-over-lyrics-dabrye.htmlYeah
Yo
While y'all just gettin' started
Nope
I ain't finished yet
You niggas is garbage like spam on the internet
I been a vet
Been in the game
Gettin' respect
Cashing them cheques
Overseas, collecting that net
While you're just gettin' your membership
My rhymes never stink
Rhymes I spit
You know they always stay legitimate

Won't speak of my life too much
Just give y'all a little bit
Swiss and American cheese on eggs Benedict
I'm international
Cats, you're game's limited
Homo, vegetarian thugs, all effeminate
Fold
That hand you playin
You ain't winnin' with
Gettin' a lot of static like my cat , he in ??????
The trees I smoke is blessed with the heaven scent
Leave the spot with ladies so elegant
That shit you talk to us stays irrelevant

Why you lames tryin' to stay in the game?
We playin' to win
We're all straight lockin' it down
Lay down clown
Ronnie Cash
Make some noise

They call me
R O double N I E Cash
Two thousand and six
You know we can't be done smashed
Detroit finest
What you call "save the best for last"
Now I'm comin' in first, you leave in a hearse
A lot of suckers want it bad but I want it the worst
It's like the heat in the game
The gift and the curse
Niggas is lames
Y'all need some wigs and a purse
Heels and a skirt
Just for bumpin' your guns you're quick to get hurt

And to my people locked up keep your head up, look
Kat still out here reppin' for you checkin' your books
And I'm a keep some on that
Still keep it banging on these streets 'til y'all come back
Used to freestyle up on these beats now we run rap
Gettin' ???????? music
But they don't want that
They scatter the truth
Hundred percent
Every time I step in the boothNow dig it
I bust flows to make you hoes quit rapping
How many niggas in the crowd want to see it happen
People be acting like they got something to prove
Picking up the mic talking all foul and rude
About who they shot and all the rocks they sold
It's a mystery to me how that bullshit went Gold
And all I hear's keep it real and represent
Nigga fuck that shit, cause I'm never hesitant
I'm from the old school, 85 get live
Peace to the true and all the fake niggas die
You must be from Mars cause I guess you never heard
That I blaze crews like a fat bag of herb
Word to my ill peeps in the streets
Flows so rugged they fucking crack the concrete
So speak up now or forever hold your peace
The new millennium that bullshit is 'bout to cease
Each and every one of you got a job to do
Gotta stay real and keep your shit true
If you want it punk you better bring your whole crew
Your shit stink like that damn doo-doo on your shoe
Microphone check, one two, one two
Breaker breaker one nine, Ronnie Kash coming through
With that ill flow, you better chill 'fore I crush you
Don't pack gats but I got niggas that'll bust you

[Hook]
I'm the microphone master, he's the super beat maker
We get def as the the others get faker
(Repeat x2)

I herd your crew like cattle and cook your ass like a steak
Your flows got less feeling that's why my shit taste great
Cause I'm the real nigga that you hate to see
Phat Kat coming straight from the 313
With that nigga Jay Dee running shit behind the boards
Don't fuck with no mics with no long-ass cords
Because man, my shit be hitting, my flows are too drastic
You bony phoney emcees get ripped like plastic
From my Grenadier, swiss blunt or a Phillie
Niggas be mad because they hoes say I'm silly
But really, what's real in this field called rap
All you wannabe gun slingers who never bust a cap
Your time's expired, nigga in the game you a liar
Ain't gon' kick dirt on a motherfucking camp fire
Your style is filth, you're gone without a trace
Won't talk behind your back I'll tell you straight to your face

[Hook x2][Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 1-Griot]
I'm from a place where the agents send
It's a age of sin, no matter what grade ya in
Not the muscle, it's the hustle that's made within
Dyke ten's, Bangor rims persuade the grin
Hustle up in the PJ's, no time for relay races
Gettin' big money, that's how we change faces
Never been ill with a pill like Mike
And sound ill on the mic, matter fact, yo, I'm realer than life
Gee and crate niggas still on the mic
Break niggas who be feelin' they hype, aight?
Clown ass niggas makin' my profession a joke
I drown ass niggas up to they throats, choke on a quote
Talk six to the God is blasphemy, they ask from me
The lesson that blow, the answer to the question is "No"
While ma' fuckas keep testin' the flow
LE be in the D, we blessin' a show

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 2-Big Tone]
Yo, we don't lean up at the bar, niggas, malt liquors
Spillin' off in a cup, Grenadine Corona from a small pitcher
Pertinent Rip Hamilton jersey half tucked
Jake's Porter house thick, tossin' 'round hits
In the city of Boom, hit my city with tunes
That instantly bloom buds before a industry move
We bust, anything move, leave it right where we seen it
Leanin', rap shit, D shit reachin' ya region
Air One's crispy enough to squeak on the cement
Hood rich, sharper than the crease on my jeans is
Savage beast to a beat, one son of a mean bitch
Genetic make-up in trade of a Lizzy street kid
I watch destiny, from the shot to the ebony
Waitin' in the wings, patient with a dream
Poppin' out a collar, them sleeves bust, wavin' at my bean
With them characteristics right there in the Mitten

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 3-Phat Kat]
Ugh, the stripes I got from the game will fill up both of my sleeves
I sit yo ass down for good like Christopher Reeves
Situations like this, better to give than recieve
Four wolves 'll bite that ass, homes, so please believe
Eat you down to the bone and bring some back to me
Around the cassy, some be better than the last nigga
Put down them guns and bet I'll whip yo ass, nigga
Don't get it twisted, I'm just provin' a point
With the raps gloryfiyin', doin' time in the joint
In the land with ya man got yo ass locked up
While yo woman in the free world with her ass knocked up
Where Blacks with crazy years fuck cocaine rocked up
Turn on the TV, all you see is people slain, chopped up
We in Iraq fightin' for oil, still price shot up
And around election time, watch Bin Laden pop up, yeah, yeah

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats[Phat Kat]
Nowadays the music is free the shows cost money
No need to ring my phone if you ain't got nothing for me
My fans told me Kat you been chilling enough
Now it's time to come and crush 'em with the rugged and rough
Dirty coach yeah I see you, wouldn't wanna be you
Smoke more weed than the nigga Wiz Khalifa
