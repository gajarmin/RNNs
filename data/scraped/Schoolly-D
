Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Number one in the hood, G(The offical adventures of...)

[Hook]
PSK we're making that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"
P for the people who can't understand
How one homeboy became a man
S for the way we scream and shout
One by one I'm knocking you out
K for the way my DJ cutting
Other MC's, man you ain't saying nothing
Rocking on to the break of dawn
I think Code Money, your time is on

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Driving in my car down the avenue
Towing on a j, sipping on some brew
Turned around, see the fly young lady
Pull to the curb and park my Mercedes
Said "Fly lady, now you're looking real nice
Sweeter than honey, sugar and spice"
Told her my name was MC Schoolly D
All about making that cash money
She said, "Schoolly D, I know your game
Heard about you in the hall of fame"
I said, "Mama, mama, I tell you no lies
Cause all I wanna do is to get you high
And uh - lay you down and do the body rock"
Took a walk to the corner, got into the car
Took a little trip to a fancy bar
Copped some brew, some j, some coke
Tell you now, brother, this ain't no joke
She got me to the crib, she laid me on the bed
I fucked her from my toes to the top of my head
I finally realized the girl was a whore
Gave her ten dollars, she asked me for some more

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Clinton Road one Saturday night
Towing on a cheeba I was feeling alright
Then my homie-homie called me on the phone
His name is Chief Keith, but we call him Bone
Told me 'bout this party on the Southside
Copped my pistol, jumped into the ride
Got at the bar, copped some flack
Copped some cheeba-cheeba, it wasn't wack
Got to the place, and who did I see
A sucker-ass nigga trying to sound like me
Put my pistol up against his head
And said, "You sucker-ass nigga I should shoot you dead"
A thought ran across my educated mind
Said, man, Schoolly D ain't doing no time
Grabbed the microphone and I started to talk
Sucker-ass nigga, man, he started to walk

[Hook]It was Saturday night and I was feeling kinda sporty
Went to the bar copped me a 40
Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came down, she said, "Who the hell?"
Wait momma, wait, it's me your little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
"I know who you are, but who the hell is that?"
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know how she got into the car
I must have picked her up when I left the bar
You know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, "Hey baby is you on the pill?
Cause, tonight I wanna be your lover
Just one thing, I forgot to buy a rubber"
Wait a little while then we snuck upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in what a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please
Put back your gun, put down your broom
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, "You come a little closer and you will get shot"
"I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock"

It was Saturday night and I was feeling kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man and who did I see?
But this super bad bitch looking back at me
I said, "Fly lady man, you got a big butt"
This bitch turned around, all she said was, "What?"
I said, "My name is Schoolly baby, uh what is yours?"
Before I knew it up come my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Saying, "Yo Schoolly School, what time is it?"
Looked a little closer and I knew it was a gag
What I thought was a girl was nothing but a fag

Everybody rapping but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rapping to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Don't come in my face and ask me why

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba making 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the thriller, it's the thing that you need

Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smoking a J and scratching the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, "Yo, what's up with that, bitch?"
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smoking a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They was 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Let me tell you a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucker MC, trying to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man trying to stick up a bar
The judge said, "Boy, what was on your mind?"
He said, "I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine."
The judge said, "Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doing shit for the next ten years."

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah, it's that Cheeba Cheeba
Cheeba Cheeba

Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the thriller, it's the thing that you need
Cheeba Cheeba ya'llYo, I'm tired of everybody telling what I can and can not do
So I'm not doing a grand finale
And they'll be no special thanks on this track
Cause this is my trademark
So if you can't take of what you're about to hear
Then cover your ear and gimme some guitar
No, it's gotta be harder
Gimme me drums
Yeah..yeah..yeah..
Cuz there's a time to be nice
But right now, it's time to be Ruthless!

[Verse 1: Tairrie B]
Yo, girls I can handle a mic, right? (Right!)
So why they all playing me like
I can't hang when the name of game is retail
That's right, I'm a female
Punk motherfuckers and I'm too strong
To let you stop me, I'll prove you wrong
Males chauvinists who refuse to believe
That a girl like me can achieve
Status, the same as a man
I'll be damned, let's make a Ruthless Jam
Gimmie a coat so I can clear my throat
Call this a sequel to Murder She Wrote
More trouble for a devil on a level of a gangstress
To the boys in my band, I give thanks, this
Beat is just what I need to get my point across
I'm the female mob boss
You know my reppin', I ain't half-stepping
Kick the rhythm as I stash my weapon
Cops are left and right
The label's under question cause we're too damn hype
And outspoken so remaining anonymous
It is impossible the name it is synonymous
With Ruthless, who will you pick
My name is Tairrie, and the B is for bitch


Black murderous the bitch is Ruthless
Black murderous the bitch is Ruthless
Black murderous the bitch is Ruthless
Black murderous the bitch is Ruthless
Black murderous...Bitch!

What the fuck is you doing now?

[Verse 2: Tairrie B]
I'm gunna tell you about a ho I know name Linda
Never with a groupie get over so I'm fi'n ta
Diss the hooker, you're just jealous
Cause I pimped all your so-called fellas
I say to myself, it's time you get caught
Linda can't pretend to be something she's not
I operate with sex appeal
You're on the Doctor's dick for a deal
When it comes down to it
You're nothing but a prostitute
Knocking boot
And now you wanna come to my town
There's only one female on Comptown, tramp
Don't think you stand a chance
I'm fed up, so let's go head up
I'll kick your ass and if that don't stop you
(The Comptown crew will drop you)
Cause you ain't no rapper, and what do you look like
Rumor has it, you're a dyke
By now you must be 43
Tell me how you gonna get with me
I'm young and beautiful, playing with the full deck
In full effect
You got no respect and your lyrics are corny
Whoever told you that you could rap, they were horny
And you were nothing more than a skeez
Please get real, you'll never get record deal
You're Fatal Attraction, that shit is scary
Who's gonna sign an ugly wannabe Tairrie? No one
You should have known better
(If she steps to you?) Yeah, let her
Then well see what the B is for
I'll autograph the fan and pimp slap the whore
She ain't down, she looks like a clown
And she's jocking every rapper and producer in town
So why, you ask, would I bother to do this?
Tell her girls..(The bitch is Ruthless!)

There's plenty of that and much more
It's about time one of you hear it, yo
(Remember the old days when you can beat up old woman.)

[Verse 3: Tairrie B]
Now when it comes to men, I got a one track mind
Step to me and you just might find
A female who stands her ground
So when provoked, I won't back down
All you had to do was love me
But instead you chose to shove me
Till death to us part for the rest of my life
No I won't be no battered wife
Taken for granted cause you rock my world
Take advantage, you're fucking with wrong girl, punk
I don't care if you're drunk or sober
Put your hands on me, it's over
Cause I don't play coy, not a with a boyfriend
But I'll play you like a toy, friend
Throw you away when I'm done
Cause a bitch is a bitch but I ain't the one
To be cheated on or beaten on
I'm talking burning bed, enough said
The fire is dead, so there's no use
Don't try to come back, you got no juice
I want a real man to respect and love me
Not a punk little sucker to push and shove me
Play it again, lemme say it again
I'm well prepared when it comes to men
You see, nowadays I rap with a vengeance
I'm a new woman but this ain't revenge, it's
Putting the past on the shelf
Cause a bitch means "being in total control of herself"
I'm not your baby doll, you juiceless
The bitch is back and this bitch is Ruthless

A crazy bitch with gangster profanity bitch
A crazy bitch with gangster profanity bitch
A crazy bitch with gangster profanity bitch
A crazy bitch with gangster profanity bitch

(Take it to the next plateau.)

[Verse 4: Tairrie B]
Verse four, I got a score to settle
This ain't high energy or heavy metal
It's rap, so when it comes to punk motherfuckers
Lemme tell you about a man and his band of suckers
Two tramps who think they can sing
Tried to rap when they thought it was an in thing
Couldn't even write a good rhyme
Cause you ain't legit, you don't know the time
To answer to LL, give me a break
No heart from the start, which proves you're fake
And nowadays, you love to base
Cause house is the latest craze
So you jump on the bandwagon, sell your soul
What's next, rock-n-roll?
You got sexed
So how does it feel to slut your way to a deal
I don't sell my body for money or a meal
And the name I use is real
What the fuck is Acacia
It's a name of a tree
Look up Tairrie B
You'll see the definition is Ruthless, rival, your enemy
Get off my tip, you ain't no friend to me
How you feel, you look real sick, not sexy
More like anorexic (You on that type call crack?)
It's either or smack cause your body is wack
Put a little meat on your bone
Pick up a fork and drop the microphone
You going down while I'm coming on Comptown
? sold gold, platinum bound
An underground sound guaranteed to succeed
Cause looks ain't all you need
You gotta have talent. You know, skill?
You can't reply on the birth control pill
So if you wanna get ill, I suggest you chill
Don't attempt to diss, you know I will
Step to ya face to face
It doesn't matter the time and you can name the place
(Word to the mother)
Take a look at my cover
I'm a Ruthless bitch, far from a lover

B-i-t-c-h something far from a lover
B-i-t-c-h something far from a lover
B-i-t-c-h something far from a lover
What you want me to?

[Verse 5: Tairrie B]
I'm the artist, the hardest
Executive producer writer arranger
So don't be too sure
That I'll played and give the credit away
And let them call me a protege
I didn't come in like a sucker
I'm not going out like one motherfucker
Yeah I speak my mind, don't tell me to shut up
Play me close home boy (What up)
If you name ain't on it
Then my record won't hit
If you don't produce it, it ain't legit
That's bullshit, you living like a sucker
You stuck up, suited up sorry motherfucker
A Ruthless attack is what's going down
But you ain't got nothing to do with Comptown
I produce myself so I brag it
Go back to wearing sequins, cause you look like a faggot
World class you got no class
So when they said let you produce me, I said I'll pass
As for the Grammys, I'll put that on the shelf
It takes a punk motherfucker to play himself
Your best shot was weak, I didn't need stiches
Get this straight, I ain't one of your bitches
You cartoon gangsta, I'm calling your bluff
Hitting a woman, that makes you real tough
I had enough of you flaunting your grip
I'm no fan so get off of your own tip
Cause the music you may come from the streets
But it sounds like Ultimate Breaks & Beats
My opinion is you ain't all that
Your a pussy, the definition; cat
And that ain't no joke you think that it's funny
Integrity is more important than money
And either you got it don't, I won't front
I'm just here to stunt
One produce who said he'd produce this
Or with or without you, I'm Ruthless


And there you have it, a Ruthless bitch
Now ask yourself, are you that ignorant punk-ass fucked up overweight wannabe gangster?
Or maybe you're that psycho, civil jocking Jerry Heller, washed-up over the hill, pushing 50 rapstar tipping, ugly wack demo never gonna be nothing, hooker?
Yeah, you probably are
I told you not to fuck with me(The spick pulls a razorblade on ya
And you got no ?mop ring? in your hand, run
You have any static with a nigger
And there ain't no whites around
You can get a spick to watch your back
You may stand a chance, but that ain't no guarantee
You have any static with a spick
Don't get no nigger to watch your back
Cause you ain't gonna have none
- Ha - you can say that again)

(Base)	--] Chuck D

(Ah yeah)

Once upon a time in the ghetto
Lived a nigga, kinda rough, kinda mellow
]From the gang called the Parkside Killers
Smoked a lotta j's, drunk a lotta Millers
On the corner sellin lleyo with the boys
Holdin his dick, fuckin with the young whores
You say, "Yo nigga, what's your name?"
He say, "Suck my dick, tell your mother do the same"
His mother and his father said fuck him
All the bitches on the block will suck him
If a nigga owes him money, better duck him
Because he just might buck-buck-buck him
On his head is a muthafuckin bounty
If he caught, he go straight to the county
Be another young brother in jail, yo
For standin on the corner, sellin that lleyo

(Ah yeah)

Just another killer

(Ah yeah)

Just another killer, baby

(Base)

I tear the roof off any muthafucka
Damn right, I could never be a sucker
Schoolly-School back on the sneak tip
Fuck the niggas that's talkin that bullshit
One-two-three-four, lookin at my Gucci
Meet a fly bitch, fuck up the coochie
I do shit you never were conceivin
I'm Schoolly-School, the nigga you believe in
Hold up, nigga, what the fuck was you thinkin?
Who's the nigga that you think that you're gankin
In my eyes you can see all the anger
That's why I'm a fuckin gangbanger
What the fuck did you expect me to wanna be?
When everytime that I turn on my TV
And every bit the drug dealer look like me
It's alright for me to pull the trigger
Just as long as I pull it on another nigger

Fuck it, I keep you dancin like James Brown
Alright boy, if you want it, here's the breakdown
I don't care how rough you think you is
I beat you down in the muthafuckin midst
I ain't tryin TO be your sister or your brother
I kick your ass like if I was your mother
I'm gonna make their minds so muthafuckin simple
To the rhyme Schoolly is a nympho
Or like a crazy muthafucka on cocaine
I'm the nigga that's fuckin up yo brain
To the niggas that's talkin that bullshit
The only thing that you're gankin is my dick
There'll never be another muthafucka like me
There ain't another brother ever will excite me
Inside my black Lee's a muthafuckin weapon
You don't dig it, keep on steppinYo yo, School, cuzin', what's up man? What's up with the record business?
Man, I think I'mma have to beat somebody up, man, they always be bitin' my shit man, y'know, man, just bitin', man
Man, I told you how them niggas are man, they ain't nothin' but squares
Oh, that's what they is

Yo Schoolly, what time is it?

[Hook]
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme
I heard you was out there writin' my lines
And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine
You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man
How the fuck didja get so cool, man
Never ever seen you play no fool"
Cuz I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and (x2)

[Verse 1]
MC Schoolly D, and I’m on the beatbox
I've never had a party that I cannot rock
And every baby girl thinks she's gettin' the world
I've never made a tune that wasn't too cool
Never been stopped next to T O P
For him to try to fuck with MC Schoolly D
2 Dolla bitches on my kitches
Suckah MC's taken out with the dishes
Rhymes so delicious, raps so vicious
Buy me a wife to do my dishes
I keep ya in stitches
Ya hangin in kitches
No itch, no ash, no crust, no bitches
I eat sandwiches
My best brand bitches
Based on fact, not based fictitious

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Tarzan and Jane does it in tree
Adam and Eve, Birds and the bees
Everybody do it but the suckah MC's
Roxanne did it to UTFO
About a sucka nigga down callin' a ho
I say baby doll, can ya meet me in the black?
We do it from the front, and we do it from the back
But don't, don't do it, cuz niggas are sly
They ain't got no job, they be down with the mob
And the only thing you'll doin'
But the only thing you'll get is burn, baby burn

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Baa baa black sheep was a little whore
Can't run hack cuz she gave herself some more
Give her a dollar, to make her scream and holler
Put my head under the bar and she made me wanna call
Reachin' in my pocket, and pulled out my gun
Shot her pimp in the head, motherfuckah fell dead
But now she's in jail in a ten year bed

(Scratching: That's- That's- That's- That's Fresh! )

[Hook]Artist: Schoolly D
Album:  Schoolly D
Song:   I don't like rock and roll

Yo yo, man, whassup, man?
Whassup man, you sayin' Prince? Say Prince?
It's Schoolly D., man, we rap!
Code Money man, so whassup man?
[Man, let them know what time it is.]

Microphone living is a thing of the past
And all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn
You fucked it all up when you let Michael in
I'd rather be a day in land of the dog
Then with some long haired tutti frutti running a mock
Because rock and roll is all illusion
Comes to no basic conclusion
Rap like jazz is not all fusion
DJ, 1200's you know he's using
I don't
I don't

Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours
Five two point size in my court of force
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight
Sippin' coqui 900, make me feel allright
Met my main man Ski, looking for a bike
Till I get on the mic, make everything right
Girl in my face, boy giving me static
Sat by my side, 38 automatic
B-boy stands, she lies on a beat
Hang downtown on a market street
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard
So all you long haired freaks better be on guard
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out
Because that is what rap's all about
I don't
I don't

Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"

Chillin' one day, I met a girl named Beaver
Took her on the Ave, conquered some cheever
Got real high as you will know
Thinking to myself while I rocked her so
Didn't like microphone, said she loved rap
So I told her: "Fly freak, sit upon my lap"
But I went too fast, gave me a slap
But I looked into her face, gave her this rap
When I rock a party, there is still a microphone
You can call me MC, you can call me on the phone
Came into the party, checked out my face
But you rock and roll lovers, get a girl in your face
Cause I came into the party with my sneakers on
Right microphones, all night long
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge
No other MC's got this kind of song
I don't
I don't

Def been mighty, rap all nighty
Chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi
We mean you ladi will have to party
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller
I get bad, watch her and bone her
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her
You left your girl, but you know I stole her
I don't
I don't

Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"{*cut and scratched "You are a negro!"*}

Am I black enough for ya, America?
I don't need no {?? ice until this hair is cut ??}
All I need is, my blackness
Some others seem to lack this
Black joy, and my black vibe
Gonna be a black man til the day I die
I'm just, rough and tough, and takin no stuff
All I really wanna know y'all.. am I black enough?

[Schoolly D]
I'm black!  Too damn powerful
{?? I'm still a bad boy, and get a hour full ??}
And if you tired of the other emcees
Well come on in and get a listen from me
Because the rhymes, fourteen carat
You suckers, you wanna grab it
But you run like a little bitty rabbit
Pullin my cape, is a very bad habit
Cocaine - you still smoke it
Homey dude, you must be jokin
My fat chain, I am chokin
All through the school, you should be votin
On the M-I-C, I'm like a pitbull
My brain my brain is so full
Of words, verbs, adjectives pronouns
Come on in, and sit on down
Just listen, to what you been missin
On the floor, your eyes will glisten
I see you wishin, on the wishbone
My name Schoolly School, I'm never alone
Just, rough and tough, and takin no stuff
All I really wanna know y'all.. am I black enough?

All I want is just some time
All I need is just another sign

[Verse 1]
Sittin at the breakfast table, smokin me a spliff
Say wassup to my lil' sis
13 and already knocked up
But the little black daddy don't give a fuck
Her mama mad cause she gave up
Took her to church every week, it couldn't save her
I got a daughter and a son
Before he say daddy, little nigga might say gun
I sit back, I blow a kiss to my mother
Even though she old, the nigga still love her
But I never knew my daddy
Nah, all I knew was some nigga in a Caddy
Stopped by every year by Christmas
Talkin that bullshit he missed us
I don't look like my granny or my mammy
I look like a muthafucka named Sammy
My mother musta been a young slut
Always talkin about the days when she had a big fat butt
You gotta do what you gotta do what you gotta do
Yo, I drink a brew
I sit back and start thinkin
Damn, should a nigga be smokin and drinkin?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning 'bout a quarter after six
Nikes on my feet, Jimmy hat on my dick
Sis on the corner, tryin to sling rock
Gramps in the back, tryin to get cock
Got me a forty, balls kinda itchin
Mom in the kitchen, start the bitchin
Smokin cheeba, take another hit
Step into the bathroom and take a little shit
I start thinkin and thinkin and thinkin
My man, I wish that I was drinkin
With my niggas, all of my homies
Fuckin with the bitches, they wanna blow me
Schoolly D, you know that I'm a lover
I fucks your aunt, your sister and your mother
Now to the nigga in the Caddy who said he was my daddy
Here's a little messge from your laddie
Fuck you, why should I bother?
What the fuck I need with a punk-ass father

[Hook][Verse 1 - Tairrie B]
Here we go on the flow, I got some suckas on the ill tip
So I suppose I'll have to straighten this up real quick
Give me that microphone and get lost
Who's taking over? the female mob boss
I'm strolling on punks like they ain't shit
Cuz I'm legit, and down with the Syndicate
But this is a Comptown hit, so it's public (Ruthless)
And thinking you can get with this is useless
I'm Tairrie B, I got this one for a purpose
Suckas trying to step because they see what's on the surface
But I'll pull your card, then we'll see who's got the hardest
It's not the color, it's the heart of the artist
And you can't ignore the woman who will roar
So look more close, notice the hardcore (hardcore)
Style, scope the dope profile
Listen a while, child, it's all compiled
Like a text, and the next to flex will get waxed
It ain't nothing but a pile of melted tracks
Schoolly, break it on down from the east coast
And let's stone cold toast

[Break]

[Verse 2]

[Tairrie B]
Now Schoolly's got the music and me, I got the lyrical
Eazy's by my side, making sure that the spirit goes
Into the show, and so the whole thing kicks
Echo Sound is where we mix

[Eazy-E]
Eazy-E's on the set and I'm removing all doubt
That a Ruthless bitch has just stepped out
[A Comptowner to the open?] that she's gulpin'
All the boyz in the hood...

[Tairrie B]
...and they go hopin'
They can get with me, like when you saw my cover
And stepped up to me trying to be my lover
But that ain't happening, yo, cuz I ain't with it
You tried to play the [declawed stay a minute?]
This style is so wild, boy you can't handle it
And if you try, I don't need a man to get
Stupid for me, I'll do just fine on my own
Gimme a microphone
And I'll rip up the system, steal the show
A girl gets out of hand and I'll smack the ho
So for those who thought I couldn't do this
(Yo Tairrie) What? (Show them who's Ruthless)

[Break]

[Verse 3]

[Tairrie B]
Now the cap I wear reads Comptown on it
Y'all can't read or something, shit
So a brother steps up talking all kinda junk
(Bitch, you ain't from Compton)

[Eazy-E]
Shut the fuck up, punk!
And pay your respects to the queen of Comptown

[Tairrie B]
Punks talking junk are the punks I stomp down
Heel to toe, in steel-toed boots
Platinum blonde with Italian roots
Clever with rhyming, forever like diamonds
You sleep while I creep so I keep climbing
Higher, objective: your desire
Always draped in the flyest attire
Damage is done and you can bet that I did it
With finesse, in a dress that's perfectly fitted
When I juice my hitlist, they can't get with this
Female caucasian, can I get a witness? (Yeah!)
I know you heard it before, I won't bore ya:
Yo Compton? Am I white and I throw ya?

[Spoken]
Yo Eazy
(What's up Tairrie?)
Yo everybody thinks that I'm rocking you and that's why I got a record deal
(Fuck naw, she won't even give me the pussy)
(Word)(Ah ha ha ha!)
(Ah, ah)
(Mmm, Frylock es tan caliente)
(Ah, ah)
I'm the pimp on top, can't never be stopped
Frylock is on the bottom and yo mama on my (BAWK!)
(Shake Zula es elegante de la casa, el Meatwad es tan grande)
Don't understand why you f---in' with the "G"
Cuz Shake got the bling, make the blind man see
Meatwad got yo mom in my ride
Rollin' up the hold up and they keep the ho's hot
Aqua Something You Know!
(Ehh, Whatever)[Schoolly D]
Fast and steady, I'm like a jet plane
So many rhymes in my brain
So many things, complex
Waitin to see what School, will do next
All the while, you've been waitin
Like a child, aggravatin
For Schoolly School, to come along
To put a dope beat into a rap song
I know, it's quite absurd
Like a school, I used to be a verb
But now I'm a bill, on Capitol Hill
So now, sit back and chill
Thinkin, a picture of Jesus
In my mind, I know that he need this
Tryin to hold back with all my might
I know damn well, he wasn't white
I look into the mirror, I say damn
Jesus was a Black Man

{interlude}

[Schoolly D]
Don't know where I'm goin, or where I'm from
All I really know is that I carry a gun
I keep dancin, to this rhythm
Don't know, just what I give em
Performin, an excism
Sit on back and listen, to my wisdom
You scream, dance you might holler
At the door cash money that dollar
Come on in, treat me like your father
Beats so dope, they grabbed you by the collar
This poem's, a lethal weapon
You don't tickle, keep on steppin
Schoolly School, too damn cool
Dope beats and dope rhymes RULE
Reach into my pocket, I say damn
Cause Jesus was a Black Man"We have a common enemy.. we have this in common
We have a common oppressor, a common exploiter
And a common dis-discriminator
So once we all, realize that we have this common enemy
Then we unite" -] Malcolm X

[Schoolly D]
Yeah, education of a black man, and his people
Gather round School like School was a steeple
Black minds and black rights and black fights
Supernatural black man, and my black might
Some say that rap is just madness
I say I'm glad that I had this
Urge and the courage, submerge
A dope beat and super dope poem
Sit on down and get a slap in the dome
Yeah it's School, that's my name
Rap - uh-huh, that's my game
Love - for my brother
Black baby, that's my color
I'm a black man

"For the same procedure, you and I can use
To get our problem solved
That's been done - all the nations came together
They were dark nations, not for the caucausians
Some of them will do this
Some of them will look"

[Schoolly D]
Some wanna stop me, some you wanna rock me
On stage, son you like to jock me
Code Money my man you hear the freeze
{*scratchin*} Make em all say please
Bring the beat back, the beat back was hittin
I'm like a black man, I'm never quittin
Some say that School is absurd
Pull my pistol, make em say word
Give you speed and speed is what you need
And but I never never give you your greed
Because greed is for a devil, and not a rebel
I'm like school, I'll put you on a level
Some say you be American
But I say be a black man, baby

Education of a black man

Uh-huh, School, that's my name
Rap, uh-huh, that's my game
Love - feel for my brother
Black, that's my color baby, yeah

"These, evil genies no they didn't have nuclear weapons
They didn't have jet planes
They didn't have all of the power of Parliament
That the white man has
But they had ?
They were able to submerge ?
And agree on one thing.."

Education of a black man[Verse 1]
My age is young, my money is green
I shock all the ladies with my gangster lean
Well Flash cut the record down to the bone
They always got me rocking on the microphone
Come on young lady, cool out and chill
Check my man out on the wheels of steel
Cuts galore, rhymes galore
And you see young lady dancing on the floor
Cuz you sucker emcees, trying to cut my ryhme
Got the girls downtown, standing in my line
Got the ? president, trying to shake my hand
Got the number to you girl, and trying to land
Got an office downtown, with secretary brown
Girls and girls, hanging all around
Got the cheeba and the black, def cad-i-lac
Butter on popcorn, you know that they can ?

[Verse 2]
Young lady, don't be shady
Come and take a ride in my Mercedes
Up to downtown, all around the world
I love to see young fly girl
With their hair so long, skin so divine
You listen to me to say another emcee rhyme
Tarzan and Jane, was sitting in the tree
F U and C, K I N and G
Tarzan fell, and bust his ass
Because on the mix, was ??
Cheetah got hot, stuck it to Jane
Now the G-House rock can never be the same

[Hook]
Emcee X6

[Verse 2]
On the corner, selling some weed
And then came along, a sucker emcee
Say, yo Holmes, whats up with that?
And can I cop me, a nickel bag sack?
I said, a nickel bag, is Ninety Nine
You can't deal you better bite some rhyme
And then I laid down this MC rhyme
I said, ??, and glorious grand
He came along and put a mic in my hand
And then you shocked all the females all across the land
Then came along, singin a song
We wrapped the whole damn block and we never went wrong
Flash cut the record down to the bone
MC will you rhyme like a microphone
Then mix master, you cut it faster
Mix master cuttin it up faster
Mix master Mark, on the wheels of steel
He's layin down the rhythm, layin down the real deal
When he was born, his mother gave birth
To the baddest DJ on the whole damn Earth
He picked up the mix, he put it in his hand
He shocked all the females all across the land
Mix master, mix master, mix master cut a little faster
I was coming home one night, on the L
Insane MC tried to snatch my ?
I said, "Yo homes, whats up with that?"
I pulled my 8 and he gave it back
He reached in his pocket pulled a bottle of wine
He asked me to say this MC rhyme
I said

[Hook]Yo yo, School, cuzin', what's up man? What's up with the record business?
Man, I think I'mma have to beat somebody up, man, they always be bitin' my shit man, y'know, man, just bitin', man
Man, I told you how them niggas are man, they ain't nothin' but squares
Oh, that's what they is

Yo Schoolly, what time is it?

[Hook]
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme
I heard you was out there writin' my lines
And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine
You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man
How the fuck didja get so cool, man
Never ever seen you play no fool"
Cuz I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and (x2)

[Verse 1]
MC Schoolly D, and I’m on the beatbox
I've never had a party that I cannot rock
And every baby girl thinks she's gettin' the world
I've never made a tune that wasn't too cool
Never been stopped next to T O P
For him to try to fuck with MC Schoolly D
2 Dolla bitches on my kitches
Suckah MC's taken out with the dishes
Rhymes so delicious, raps so vicious
Buy me a wife to do my dishes
I keep ya in stitches
Ya hangin in kitches
No itch, no ash, no crust, no bitches
I eat sandwiches
My best brand bitches
Based on fact, not based fictitious

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Tarzan and Jane does it in tree
Adam and Eve, Birds and the bees
Everybody do it but the suckah MC's
Roxanne did it to UTFO
About a sucka nigga down callin' a ho
I say baby doll, can ya meet me in the black?
We do it from the front, and we do it from the back
But don't, don't do it, cuz niggas are sly
They ain't got no job, they be down with the mob
And the only thing you'll doin'
But the only thing you'll get is burn, baby burn

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Baa baa black sheep was a little whore
Can't run hack cuz she gave herself some more
Give her a dollar, to make her scream and holler
Put my head under the bar and she made me wanna call
Reachin' in my pocket, and pulled out my gun
Shot her pimp in the head, motherfuckah fell dead
But now she's in jail in a ten year bed

(Scratching: That's- That's- That's- That's Fresh! )

[Hook]Artist: Schoolly D
Album:  Schoolly D
Song:   I don't like rock and roll

Yo yo, man, whassup, man?
Whassup man, you sayin' Prince? Say Prince?
It's Schoolly D., man, we rap!
Code Money man, so whassup man?
[Man, let them know what time it is.]

Microphone living is a thing of the past
And all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn
You fucked it all up when you let Michael in
I'd rather be a day in land of the dog
Then with some long haired tutti frutti running a mock
Because rock and roll is all illusion
Comes to no basic conclusion
Rap like jazz is not all fusion
DJ, 1200's you know he's using
I don't
I don't

Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours
Five two point size in my court of force
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight
Sippin' coqui 900, make me feel allright
Met my main man Ski, looking for a bike
Till I get on the mic, make everything right
Girl in my face, boy giving me static
Sat by my side, 38 automatic
B-boy stands, she lies on a beat
Hang downtown on a market street
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard
So all you long haired freaks better be on guard
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out
Because that is what rap's all about
I don't
I don't

Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"

Chillin' one day, I met a girl named Beaver
Took her on the Ave, conquered some cheever
Got real high as you will know
Thinking to myself while I rocked her so
Didn't like microphone, said she loved rap
So I told her: "Fly freak, sit upon my lap"
But I went too fast, gave me a slap
But I looked into her face, gave her this rap
When I rock a party, there is still a microphone
You can call me MC, you can call me on the phone
Came into the party, checked out my face
But you rock and roll lovers, get a girl in your face
Cause I came into the party with my sneakers on
Right microphones, all night long
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge
No other MC's got this kind of song
I don't
I don't

Def been mighty, rap all nighty
Chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi
We mean you ladi will have to party
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller
I get bad, watch her and bone her
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her
You left your girl, but you know I stole her
I don't
I don't

Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"[Hook]
I wanna get dusted, I gotta get dusted baby
I wanna get dusted, I gotta get dusted baby

[Verse 1]
Drivin in my car, down the avenue
Chewing on a J, what the fuck can ya do?
Dip around the corner in my nigga's Mercedes
First thing I see is a fly young lady
Jump out my ride and proceed to kick game
First thing I kick is my motherfuckin name
Schoolly D bitch you know that I'mma winner
I getcha high and take ya ass out to dinner
Talk about the cheeba and we talk about the black
Its 93 and the bitch smoked crack
Took her to the crib, first thing that I did
Kicked her ass and I fucked her on the bed
I pulled the gat and popped two in the dome
Yo my nigga, cause its on
Seen mo' blood than a nightmare thriller
Schoolly D, I'mma crack bitch killa

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sitting in the crib, mindin my own
I get a call from my nigga named Bone
Told me that some niggas was tripping
I grab my gat and put the motherfuckin clip in
Grab my cheeba, jump into my ride
Had to cruise to the south side
Looking on the corner who should I see?
A motherfucker lookin just like me
I grab my gat, start popping
Punk motherfuckers start dropping
Seen more blood than a friday night thrilla
Schoolly D, the crack pussy killa

[Hook]Muthafuck it, I get straight to the point
You don't dig what I'm sayin, then fuck you
Cause sellin drugs only job that a nigga got
Sellin caine to the kids in the parkin lot
Some niggas live, some niggas gotta get dropped
You say 'damn' - my man, you don't understand
How could you be so cold to a brotherman?
Don't come around here teachin and preachin
Because a nigga like me you ain't reachin
Cause all I care about is sellin my lleyo
Makin money like a nigga make mayo
Toke on weed, sippin on my Olde E
All the crackheads all on my wee-wee
Rollin hard in a rag-top Volvo
911 on my ass, I'mma roll on
You don't understand where a brother comin from
That's why young black men always on the run
You either gangbang, or you get hanged
Kill another nigga, it ain't no thang

(Gangster Boogie)

Pull a 8 on a nigga, say 'fuck you'
Then pull away in my BMW
Cause on the street you gotta be a little meaner
But that's how my pockets get greener
Runnin shit, gotta be a little candid
Some time you be a little a bandit
Sellin dope out of my crackhouse
You either kick game, or you get gamed
(You don't know the pain)

(Kick that shit)

King of New York

Yo muthafucka, it's time to get rolled on
Strolled on, you better get a hold on
How the fuck you expect me to get back
If I never had to pull on my git-gat?
Because to me it ain't nothin but a killin
That's how a nigga be feelin
I call a homie on the mobile ( *dialing* )
What up, my nigga, it's about that time
Grab the Uzi, the eight and the nine
When a nigga be rollin on the ave
Sometime it gonna be a blood bath
But when I'm comin, no playin, no jokin
I let the Uzi and nine be smokin
Alright now, back to my tale, yo
Spot the nigga on the corner sellin lleyo
Pull up, "Yo, what up, gee?"
He didn't see my nigga in the backseat
All I heard was "Please don't shoot!"
( *shots* ) grabbed the caine and the loot
(It's like that, and that's the way it is)
(So damn) (tough)
Now a nigga on the top of the world, see
I got the women, the dope and the jewelry
I'm livin large in a fat-ass crib
Don't give a damn about the shit I just did
Then I heard a knock-knock at my door
Said "Oh shit!" - I hit the floor
One of my homies on the ave was a big snitch
I said "Oh shit!" - jumped through the window
Bullets were flyin, people was cryin
Fuck it, some nigga was dyin
You either gas on or you get gased
Now I die with a bullet in my ass

(So damn) (tough)
(So damn) (tough)

PSK we're making that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"
P for the people who can't understand
How one homeboy became a man
S for the way we scream and shout
One by one I'm knocking you out
K for the way my DJ cutting
Other MC's, man you ain't saying nothing
Rocking on to the break of dawn
I think Code Money, your time is on

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Driving in my car down the avenue
Towing on a j, sipping on some brew
Turned around, see the fly young lady
Pull to the curb and park my Mercedes
Said "Fly lady, now you're looking real nice
Sweeter than honey, sugar and spice"
Told her my name was MC Schoolly D
All about making that cash money
She said, "Schoolly D, I know your game
Heard about you in the hall of fame"
I said, "Mama, mama, I tell you no lies
Cause all I wanna do is to get you high
And uh - lay you down and do the body rock"
Took a walk to the corner, got into the car
Took a little trip to a fancy bar
Copped some brew, some j, some coke
Tell you now, brother, this ain't no joke
She got me to the crib, she laid me on the bed
I fucked her from my toes to the top of my head
I finally realized the girl was a whore
Gave her ten dollars, she asked me for some more

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Clinton Road one Saturday night
Towing on a cheeba I was feeling alright
Then my homie-homie called me on the phone
His name is Chief Keith, but we call him Bone
Told me 'bout this party on the Southside
Copped my pistol, jumped into the ride
Got at the bar, copped some flack
Copped some cheeba-cheeba, it wasn't wack
Got to the place, and who did I see
A sucker-ass nigga trying to sound like me
Put my pistol up against his head
And said, "You sucker-ass nigga I should shoot you dead"
A thought ran across my educated mind
Said, man, Schoolly D ain't doing no time
Grabbed the microphone and I started to talk
Sucker-ass nigga, man, he started to walk

[Hook]Yo, I'm tired of everybody telling what I can and can not do
So I'm not doing a grand finale
And they'll be no special thanks on this track
Cause this is my trademark
So if you can't take of what you're about to hear
Then cover your ear and gimme some guitar
No, it's gotta be harder
Gimme me drums
Yeah..yeah..yeah..
Cuz there's a time to be nice
But right now, it's time to be Ruthless!

[Verse 1: Tairrie B]
Yo, girls I can handle a mic, right? (Right!)
So why they all playing me like
I can't hang when the name of game is retail
That's right, I'm a female
Punk motherfuckers and I'm too strong
To let you stop me, I'll prove you wrong
Males chauvinists who refuse to believe
That a girl like me can achieve
Status, the same as a man
I'll be damned, let's make a Ruthless Jam
Gimmie a coat so I can clear my throat
Call this a sequel to Murder She Wrote
More trouble for a devil on a level of a gangstress
To the boys in my band, I give thanks, this
Beat is just what I need to get my point across
I'm the female mob boss
You know my reppin', I ain't half-stepping
Kick the rhythm as I stash my weapon
Cops are left and right
The label's under question cause we're too damn hype
And outspoken so remaining anonymous
It is impossible the name it is synonymous
With Ruthless, who will you pick
My name is Tairrie, and the B is for bitch


Black murderous the bitch is Ruthless
Black murderous the bitch is Ruthless
Black murderous the bitch is Ruthless
Black murderous the bitch is Ruthless
Black murderous...Bitch!

What the fuck is you doing now?

[Verse 2: Tairrie B]
I'm gunna tell you about a ho I know name Linda
Never with a groupie get over so I'm fi'n ta
Diss the hooker, you're just jealous
Cause I pimped all your so-called fellas
I say to myself, it's time you get caught
Linda can't pretend to be something she's not
I operate with sex appeal
You're on the Doctor's dick for a deal
When it comes down to it
You're nothing but a prostitute
Knocking boot
And now you wanna come to my town
There's only one female on Comptown, tramp
Don't think you stand a chance
I'm fed up, so let's go head up
I'll kick your ass and if that don't stop you
(The Comptown crew will drop you)
Cause you ain't no rapper, and what do you look like
Rumor has it, you're a dyke
By now you must be 43
Tell me how you gonna get with me
I'm young and beautiful, playing with the full deck
In full effect
You got no respect and your lyrics are corny
Whoever told you that you could rap, they were horny
And you were nothing more than a skeez
Please get real, you'll never get record deal
You're Fatal Attraction, that shit is scary
Who's gonna sign an ugly wannabe Tairrie? No one
You should have known better
(If she steps to you?) Yeah, let her
Then well see what the B is for
I'll autograph the fan and pimp slap the whore
She ain't down, she looks like a clown
And she's jocking every rapper and producer in town
So why, you ask, would I bother to do this?
Tell her girls..(The bitch is Ruthless!)

There's plenty of that and much more
It's about time one of you hear it, yo
(Remember the old days when you can beat up old woman.)

[Verse 3: Tairrie B]
Now when it comes to men, I got a one track mind
Step to me and you just might find
A female who stands her ground
So when provoked, I won't back down
All you had to do was love me
But instead you chose to shove me
Till death to us part for the rest of my life
No I won't be no battered wife
Taken for granted cause you rock my world
Take advantage, you're fucking with wrong girl, punk
I don't care if you're drunk or sober
Put your hands on me, it's over
Cause I don't play coy, not a with a boyfriend
But I'll play you like a toy, friend
Throw you away when I'm done
Cause a bitch is a bitch but I ain't the one
To be cheated on or beaten on
I'm talking burning bed, enough said
The fire is dead, so there's no use
Don't try to come back, you got no juice
I want a real man to respect and love me
Not a punk little sucker to push and shove me
Play it again, lemme say it again
I'm well prepared when it comes to men
You see, nowadays I rap with a vengeance
I'm a new woman but this ain't revenge, it's
Putting the past on the shelf
Cause a bitch means "being in total control of herself"
I'm not your baby doll, you juiceless
The bitch is back and this bitch is Ruthless

A crazy bitch with gangster profanity bitch
A crazy bitch with gangster profanity bitch
A crazy bitch with gangster profanity bitch
A crazy bitch with gangster profanity bitch

(Take it to the next plateau.)

[Verse 4: Tairrie B]
Verse four, I got a score to settle
This ain't high energy or heavy metal
It's rap, so when it comes to punk motherfuckers
Lemme tell you about a man and his band of suckers
Two tramps who think they can sing
Tried to rap when they thought it was an in thing
Couldn't even write a good rhyme
Cause you ain't legit, you don't know the time
To answer to LL, give me a break
No heart from the start, which proves you're fake
And nowadays, you love to base
Cause house is the latest craze
So you jump on the bandwagon, sell your soul
What's next, rock-n-roll?
You got sexed
So how does it feel to slut your way to a deal
I don't sell my body for money or a meal
And the name I use is real
What the fuck is Acacia
It's a name of a tree
Look up Tairrie B
You'll see the definition is Ruthless, rival, your enemy
Get off my tip, you ain't no friend to me
How you feel, you look real sick, not sexy
More like anorexic (You on that type call crack?)
It's either or smack cause your body is wack
Put a little meat on your bone
Pick up a fork and drop the microphone
You going down while I'm coming on Comptown
? sold gold, platinum bound
An underground sound guaranteed to succeed
Cause looks ain't all you need
You gotta have talent. You know, skill?
You can't reply on the birth control pill
So if you wanna get ill, I suggest you chill
Don't attempt to diss, you know I will
Step to ya face to face
It doesn't matter the time and you can name the place
(Word to the mother)
Take a look at my cover
I'm a Ruthless bitch, far from a lover

B-i-t-c-h something far from a lover
B-i-t-c-h something far from a lover
B-i-t-c-h something far from a lover
What you want me to?

[Verse 5: Tairrie B]
I'm the artist, the hardest
Executive producer writer arranger
So don't be too sure
That I'll played and give the credit away
And let them call me a protege
I didn't come in like a sucker
I'm not going out like one motherfucker
Yeah I speak my mind, don't tell me to shut up
Play me close home boy (What up)
If you name ain't on it
Then my record won't hit
If you don't produce it, it ain't legit
That's bullshit, you living like a sucker
You stuck up, suited up sorry motherfucker
A Ruthless attack is what's going down
But you ain't got nothing to do with Comptown
I produce myself so I brag it
Go back to wearing sequins, cause you look like a faggot
World class you got no class
So when they said let you produce me, I said I'll pass
As for the Grammys, I'll put that on the shelf
It takes a punk motherfucker to play himself
Your best shot was weak, I didn't need stiches
Get this straight, I ain't one of your bitches
You cartoon gangsta, I'm calling your bluff
Hitting a woman, that makes you real tough
I had enough of you flaunting your grip
I'm no fan so get off of your own tip
Cause the music you may come from the streets
But it sounds like Ultimate Breaks & Beats
My opinion is you ain't all that
Your a pussy, the definition; cat
And that ain't no joke you think that it's funny
Integrity is more important than money
And either you got it don't, I won't front
I'm just here to stunt
One produce who said he'd produce this
Or with or without you, I'm Ruthless


And there you have it, a Ruthless bitch
Now ask yourself, are you that ignorant punk-ass fucked up overweight wannabe gangster?
Or maybe you're that psycho, civil jocking Jerry Heller, washed-up over the hill, pushing 50 rapstar tipping, ugly wack demo never gonna be nothing, hooker?
Yeah, you probably are
I told you not to fuck with meIt was Saturday night and I was feeling kinda sporty
Went to the bar copped me a 40
Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came down, she said, "Who the hell?"
Wait momma, wait, it's me your little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
"I know who you are, but who the hell is that?"
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know how she got into the car
I must have picked her up when I left the bar
You know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, "Hey baby is you on the pill?
Cause, tonight I wanna be your lover
Just one thing, I forgot to buy a rubber"
Wait a little while then we snuck upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in what a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please
Put back your gun, put down your broom
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, "You come a little closer and you will get shot"
"I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock"

It was Saturday night and I was feeling kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man and who did I see?
But this super bad bitch looking back at me
I said, "Fly lady man, you got a big butt"
This bitch turned around, all she said was, "What?"
I said, "My name is Schoolly baby, uh what is yours?"
Before I knew it up come my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Saying, "Yo Schoolly School, what time is it?"
Looked a little closer and I knew it was a gag
What I thought was a girl was nothing but a fag

Everybody rapping but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rapping to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Don't come in my face and ask me why

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba making 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the thriller, it's the thing that you need

Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smoking a J and scratching the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, "Yo, what's up with that, bitch?"
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smoking a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They was 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Let me tell you a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucker MC, trying to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man trying to stick up a bar
The judge said, "Boy, what was on your mind?"
He said, "I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine."
The judge said, "Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doing shit for the next ten years."

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah, it's that Cheeba Cheeba
Cheeba Cheeba

Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the thriller, it's the thing that you need
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll[Intro]
Yeah, what's up, what's goin on?
Before we start this next record
I gotta put my shades on
So I can feel cool
Remember that law
When you have to put your shades on to feel cool?
Well it's still a law, you gotta put your shades on so you can feel cool
You know what I'm sayin?
I'mma put my shades on so I can see what you ain't doin'
And you ain't doin' nothin, you ain't doin' nothin
That I don't see
Now let's get on with this shit anyway

[Schoolly D]
Way, way down, in the ghetto Tee
The badass pimp stepped on the signifying rapper's feet
And the rapper said, Nigga can't you see
You're standin on my motherfucking feet?
The badass pimp said, Sure I ain't heard a cocksucking word you said
You say some more, I'll be standin on your motherfucking head
Yeah that's what he said
Cause every day, when the sun go down
The badass pimp come and kick that rappers ass all over ghetto town
But the rapper got wise, started using his wit
And said man, I'm gettin tired of this kick-ass shit
So early, early early the very next day
The rapper said, mister pimp, mister pimp I got something to say
There's this mean, big bad faggot comin your way
He talk about you so bad, turn my hair gray
Listen, listen to what he say
Listen to this mister badass pimp
This what the faggot said
He said, you know your daddy and he's a faggot
And your mother's a whore
He said he seen you sellin asshole door to door
Yeah that's what he said, listen to what else he said mister badass pimp
He said, your granny, she's a dyke
And your other brother, he's a faggot
And your little sister Loo
She's so low she sucked the dick of a little maggot
Yeah that's what he said
The badass pimp was mad
Jumped up in a hell of a rage
Hopped in his Caddy and loaded his 12 guage
Caught up with the faggot on 55th and Vine
Said you faggot, it's gonna be your ass or mine
The faggot looked at the pimp, and saw fear in his eyes
Said motherfucker, you better go fuck with somebody your own damn size
The pimp made his move, and thought he was fast
The faggot side-stepped him and kicked him in his ass
They fought all that night, and all the next day
That faggot kicked that pimp's ass in a hell of a way
Me myself I don't know how he survived
Came back to the projects more dead than alive
And the rapper, standin up on one of those tall ass project buildings
He said, DAMN somethin smells
He said, mister badass pimp look live you've been through hell
As I told one of my hoes before you left
I should've kicked your ass my motherfucking selfCheeba, cheeba on my brain
Went downtown jump the train
12 o’clock in New York
No cab, had to walk
Downtown Latin Quarter
Got inside drunk some water
Stepped on stage started to talk
Said yo yo what up New York

Danced all around act so silly
Homie in the crowd said must be from Philly
Code was cuttin’ I was grabbing my dick
Thought to my self I'm tired as shit
Jump off stage ran outside
Grab Code Money jumped a ride
Turn left no homie turn right
Straight back to the after midnight

Got to the place people was cheering
Girls threw panties that they was wearing
Fellas in the back they was leering
My fat gold chain they was staring
I wasn't caring you faggots
I ain't fearing
Calm down cool and chill
Crack another forty smoke some kill

Woke up early Sunday morn
Jump out of bed Fila's on
Thought about the hangover
Kissed the dog called my mom Rover
Went to the kitchen Cap’n Crunch
Turn on the tube the Brady Bunch
Instead of a house they live in a palace
Jan was fucking Mike and Mike was fucking Alice

My little eyes opened up wide
The thing in my pants started to rise
Sat down on the couch to cool and chill
Crack me a forty roll some kill
I was smoking I was toking
My mom said boy you must be joking
Threw me outside it was raining I was soaking
That weed so damn provoking

Yeah!! So I crack another forty
Smoke some kill

[Schoolly D]
Don't call me nigger... WHITEY! (2X)
Don't call me nigger (nigger) WHITEY! (2X)

The whitey my man, you say you're my fan
I look into your face and I gots to say damn
I feel a lot of pain, the money you gain
Because I'm black you think it's come out of 'caine
I'll put you on a level, same as the devil
Stole my bass then you steal all my treble
Line to the eye, a bullet to the head
For all those lies, motherfucker you said
No you can't face this, so you disgrace it
I'm Schoolly School boy, and I will lace it

Don't call me nigger... WHITEY! (2X)
Don't call me nigger (nigger) WHITEY! (2X)

Now take that word nigger, and this is what I figure
A nigger, is ignorant, shiftless and lazy
So what you tryin to say boy, is that I'm crazy
Now I'm not a racist, or a fanatic
But what I'm bout to say might cause a little static
White America was raised on sanction
And to the black man, I'd like to mention
When I am Schoolin, on the microphone
Yo homes, leave the fuckin crack alone

Don't call me nigger... WHITEY! (2X)
Don't call me nigger (nigger) WHITEY! (2X)
